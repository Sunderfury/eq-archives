I have put together all my knowledge of a job that for some reason I was strangely drawn to right from the start. I have spent much time playing the class of Thaumaturge (THM) and hope that when you read this guide you will get some useful information that helps you in your quest for fun and excitement. I don't claim to know everything, but anything I put in the guide is from personal observation unless stated otherwise. If you have any feedback it would be greatly appreciated and of course if you can add to it please post so I can credit you and add the information. If I can validate the information before I put it in then I will, otherwise I will state that it is so far unconfirmed by myself. <br /> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br /><b>Contents:</b> <br /> <br />In this guide you will find: <br /> <br />1. Thaumaturge what is it? <br />2. Beginning the game as a THM <br />3. The THM Guild and Guildmarks <br />4. THM Abilities list (All abilities in orange are confirmed) <br />5. THM Equipment &amp; Weapons list <br />6. Spell Combinations <br />7. Solo Hunting Grounds <br />a) La Noscea <br />b) Thanalan <br />c) The Black Shroud <br />8. Stats <br />9. Macros <br />10. Soloist vs Party Mage <br />11. Testing <br />12. Credits <br /> <br />*** Warning - This guide may contain some spoilers - Warning *** <br /> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />UPDATED 8/12/2010 <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />1. Thaumaturge, what is it? <br /> <br />Disciple of Magic: Thaumaturge. <br /> <br />“Death is only the beginning.  <br />In the hands of a skilled practitioner, thaumaturgy can be a force of terrifying destruction. At the heart of this school of magic lies the ability to call forth and command the latent aether within oneself through deep introspection. <br />To then mold that aether into sorcery, the thaumaturge makes use of a scepter or staff, within which is housed a medium -- a natural stone imbued with magical properties. The guild is centered at the Arrzaneth Ossuary in Ul'dah, within those hallowed halls are said to reside powers of life, death, and the beyond.” <br /> <br />Role: <br />“Thaumaturges are unparalleled in their powers of destruction, eclipsing even the Disciple of War. <br />By enfeebling enemies and enhancing allies, thaumaturgy can prove to be an invaluable asset, particularly in battles of attrition.” <br />For further information on this relating to the real world check out this link <a href="HTTP://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaumaturgy" rel="external nofollow" title="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaumaturgy">here.</a> <br /> <br />Thaumaturge is a Debuffer, Healer, crowd controller and to a much lesser extent Nuker and Buffer. It is a difficult class to describe and having played one for many months now I still don’t have the words to truly encapsulate the class. If you pick the road of the THM and play it with gusto I predict that you will have to think on your toes quite often, think about where you and others stand, learn to love the macro and targeting system, but most of all enjoy a class that has some level of complexity compared to DOW jobs. <br /> <br />At present it is the least played job on most servers and there are many opinions why. Check out the forums for further information. :) <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />2. Beginning the game as a Thaumaturge. <br /> <br />I recommend that if you are reading this guide before you have created your character, you start out in the starting city of either Ul’dah or Limsa Lominsa, I tried both during the testing phase and went with Ul’Dah for retail as it had the Thaumaturge Guild there but also because it has the Goldsmithing Guild in it, Alchemist Guild and Miners guild – The Goldsmithing Guild is very useful to you as you may want to rank up this craft to make and repair your weapons as you go along your THM journey. I know I found this very useful. <br /> <br />Your starting gear is limited but proficient enough for you to get to Rank 10 with. You may want to purchase better gear as you make those first few ranks but if you play well you will get to Rank 10 very quickly and your purchases may soon become out of date. You will get Gil(the currency everyone uses to trade for items etc) if you complete regional levequests. This will give you the means to purchase new gear if you need. I stayed with my low level gear (Mostly all called Weathered 'insert name of item' etc) and my Onion Helm until about Rank 12 before I bought anything new. <br /> <br />Go out there and have fun – learn the job as it progresses. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />3. The THM Guild and Guildmarks <br /> <br /><span style="color:indigo">Thaumaturges Guild</span> <br /> <br />The Guild is located in Ul’Dah and there is not much you can really do there until you are R20 apart from spend any Guildmarks you may have (more of this later but you may not get many of these for a while anyway) <br /> <br />Rank 20: <br />Your first guild quest can be taken at Rank 20 (unconfirmed by me, but supposedly as early as Rank 18) and you have to be at least at Mission 15 or above in the <a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/en/quest.html?ffxivquest=110009" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxiv.zam.com/en/quest.html?ffxivquest=110009">main storyline.</a> <br /> <br />Name: The Big Payback <br />NPC quest starter: Yayake, Thaumaturge Guild, Ul'Dah <br />other NPC's: I'llofii(THM guild) <br />Mobs: <span class="spoiler" onmouseover="this.className=''" onmouseout="this.className='spoiler'">Three rounds of Goats (5+1+1)</span> <br />Finish NPC: I'llofii(THM guild) <br />Reward: <span class="spoiler" onmouseover="this.className=''" onmouseout="this.className='spoiler'">20k Gil, 2k Guildmarks</span> <br /><a href="HTTP://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f7IzmZgiZw" rel="external nofollow" title="www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f7IzmZgiZw">Youtube Link</a>  <br /> <br />(thanks Obiar)**Finally completed this myself as a 21 THM - not too hard. The first wave are very very easy - hitting me for around 10-15 each, the next mob is on you very quickly (already before I had finished killing the other group), but again is pretty easy. The final mob appears after you get a drop so dont think the fight is done! This one is a little tricky so I would recommend saving punishing barbs for this fight, keep hp up and hit as often as you can with damnation (I found absorb def to be good in this fight).  <br /> <br />Rank 30: <br />Your second Guild quest is at Rank 30. You have to be Rank 30 to get this mission. <br /> <br />Name: Revalry and Rivalry <br />NPC quest starter: Yayake, Thaumaturge Guild, Ul'Dah <br />Other NPC's: Overweening Thaumaturge(THM guild), Baderon (Limsa Lominsa), Bodenoff (Limsa Lominsa) <br />Mobs: <span class="spoiler" onmouseover="this.className=''" onmouseout="this.className='spoiler'">Ignis Fatuss (Bomb)</span> <br />Finish NPC: Yayake(THM guild) <br />Reward: <span class="spoiler" onmouseover="this.className=''" onmouseout="this.className='spoiler'">30k Gil, 3k Guildmarks</span> <br /> <br />Walkthrough: <br /><span class="spoiler" onmouseover="this.className=''" onmouseout="this.className='spoiler'">1. When you have hit Rank 30 Thaumaturge. <br />2. Speak to Yayake in the Thaumaturges Guild in Ul'Dah. <br />3. Speak to Overweening Thaumaturge in the corner of the Thaumaturges Guild. <br />4. Head to Limsa Lominsa and speak with Badaron in the adventurers Guild. <br />5. Head out into La Nocsea and go north of Camp Bearded Rock (pos:20-26). <br />6. Enter the instance when promted and fight the Ignis Fatuss - was Blue to a Rank 30 - easy fight. <br />7. Head to Bodenoff at the Blacksmiths Guild in Limsa Lominsa. <br />8. Speak to him twice and choose to use the power of the echo. <br />9. Head back to Ul'Dah and speak once again with Yayake. <br />10. Speak once again with the Overweening Thaumaturge. <br />11. Speak one more time with Yayake for your reward. 30k Gil and 3k THM guildmarks.</span> <br />Complete! <br /> <br />Rank 36: <br /> <br />TBA <br /> <br /><span style="color:pink">THM Guildmarks</span>  <br /> <br />Guildmarks are awarded from leves. They replace the gil reward but sometimes you can still get an item reward in addition to guildmarks. If you can, trade completed leves for leves that give guildmarks as a reward, as you can double or treble the total amount of guildmarks you get. I have currently bought four traits with guildmarks as I have been only been awarded THM guildmarks as my other classes are below 10 and 20 respectively, but I have no more that I can buy until Shadowfall (which I bought for 500 in Beta lol!) because it is a R40 ability that probably won’t become available until I am much higher. <br /> <br /><i><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/en/ability.html?ffxivability=28589" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxiv.zam.com/en/ability.html?ffxivability=28589">Silouette</a></i> – [6000marks] - Single attack that reduces enmity for caster. I found this to be a great alternative to PD! No action cost, so you can equip as well as PD and when I was doing Leve’s each time I got hate I cast this and the mobs turned away! Wow such a cool move for us. It hits for nearly the same as PD so you can spam it as much as you like. I found it most useful when I needed to cure another player with Sacrifice II. I would cast Cure and then immediately cast Silhouette – PING no enmity. Just got this in retail but not had opportunity to use it in party situation yet. Hope it’s as good as in Beta. <br /> <br /><i><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/en/ability.html?ffxivability=28567" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxiv.zam.com/en/ability.html?ffxivability=28567">Shadowfall</a></i> - [12000marks] - Launch a shadowy attack, dealing damage to target and nearby enemies. Optimal Rank 40. I got this ability available to me at R33. This ability is an attack similar to Phantom Dart however it hits all mobs in a conal Aoe range at a similar distance to phantom dart. You have to be careful with this as it seems pretty powerful (hitting for more than Phantom Dart). Remember that a mob must be red before you will get any SP/EXP from it so ensure that the mobs you are killing are all red. I found this works very well for Leve's with mobs in a party. Another good aspect to this move is that it generates you lots of TP, so its useful for setting off Flashfreeze and Damnation. <br /> <br /><i><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/en/ability.html?ffxivability=29477" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxiv.zam.com/en/ability.html?ffxivability=29477">Firm Conviction</a></i> - Raises defence while casting. [8000 marks].

Yes these are not equipped when you are playing a THM so are totally worthless as far as I can tell. <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />4.

Barbs/Shock Spikes <br />-this combo uses up most of your action points but I found great for solo at Rank 22. <br />You will notice I have added CONJUROR spells there. These are pretty useful for a solo THM. Its definately worth leveling CON up for Cure and Shock Spikes. Stoneskin good also, as is protect and Shell. CON and THM spells stack nicely together but just dont forget that other class actions have penalties as in slower cast and recast times. Stoneskin as a THM seems to take a long time!  <br /> <br />The Conjuror ability <a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/en/ability.html?ffxivability=29479" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxiv.zam.com/en/ability.html?ffxivability=29479">Fastcast</a> is a very useful trait that you can purchase with Conjuror guildmarks. Levelling up your CON for this ability seems very well worth it. An example of why this is a good idea is when you are ‘competing’ with another mage for SP, Fastcast gives you the distinct advantage. I was doing this the other day with another THM (Hey Taedium! :)), who had fastcast. Every time we both began to heal I would end up second. I still received a very good amount of SP but as I came second best each time I realised that we all should get this trait. I have urgently started ranking up my CON because of this. In addition to this having a R20 CON helps us out as we get Cure II which can’t be a bad thing either :) <br /> <br />Party Spell Combo's <br />Recently I have been trying our several debuffs etc. At 29 here is my list of spells set: <br />Top row: <br />PD/Silouette/Damnation/Scourge/ABS ACC/Profundity/Poison/Paralyze <br />Second row: <br />Sacrifice I&amp;II/CureI&amp;II/Siphon MP/Stygian Spikes/Punishing Barbs/Protect/Shell/Exaltation <br /> <br />Good ideas anyone?  <br />Scourge/Bio/Blood Rite and Damnation? <br />Banish/Dia/Blood Rite/Dark Seal and Damnation? <br />Gravity/poison/bio/Dia - DoT kills? <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />7. <b>Solo Hunting Grounds</b> -  <br />You can solo as a THM, in fact using our abilities many classes benefit from greater survivability when soloing. I recommend soloing from at least 1-10 as you will learn aspects of the job and these ranks are you initial training exercise. 10-20 you can solo with no massive difficulties but after about rank 15 you may want to start picking up your first party. The reason for this, simple you will start getting more SP, and you will find it more difficult to get maximum SP from a single mob but more importantly you will need to learn how to play the job with others around. Even though at the time of writing there is no end-game content in the game, there will be and I guess that, like other classes, THM will have its role to play. Post 20 I have found THM a difficult job to solo, not because we can’t beat mobs, but because the way we get SP is by casting and the solo caster is at present in no way rewarded for this. <br />The solo guides below are what I’ve found on my travels of various versions of the game (alpha to Beta to retail) But first you may want to try these links from other people in ZAM: <br /><a href="http://ffxiv.zam.com/wiki/FFXIV_Leveling_Guide" title="http://ffxiv.zam.com/wiki/FFXIV_Leveling_Guide" rel="external nofollow">http://ffxiv.zam.com/wiki/FFXIV_Leveling_Guide</a> <br /><a href="http://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?game=268&amp;mid=1286831975150948549&amp;page=1" title="http://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?game=268&amp;mid=1286831975150948549&amp;page=1" rel="external">http://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?game=268&amp;mid=1286831975150948549&amp;page=1</a> <br />Both links are good but I have added a few of my own personal spots in the information below... <br /> <br />a)<span style="color:red">La Noscea</span> <br />(Rank 1 -2): <br /><i>Wharf Rats</i>: These are plentiful around Camp Bearded Rock and even further afield. Around level 5 or so they get a little too easy and you get less rank points. <br />(Rank 4-5): <i>Lost Wethers</i> and <i>Lost Ewes</i> - bottom right of the map near the 'Treasures of the Main' quest. This area has many mobs and is hardly used by other players. (<i>many thanks to Chrysothemis for info!</i>) **Open Beta update*** Sheep in limsa are still good for soloing. However, salamanders now aggro and the closest aetheryte node is blocked by salamanders, so you have to walk all the way back from Bearded Rock if you die. There is also a gobbue that aggros in the area, but it's not hard to avoid. Sheep also drop a lot of wind shards, which if you are a crafter from Ul'dah, you might need, as they are hard to find in Thanalan. <br />(Rank 7 - 8): <br />Difficult to find anything that really gave me good exp - You can try <i>Puks</i> if you can find easy prey ones - they give really good exp even at 9 but are tough to kill and you'll need to replentish mp a lot. <i>Aeriela</i> (Jellyfish) are a little easier and give similar rank points. These can be found near the coastal regions of the area around Camp Bearded Rock. <br /> <br />(Rank 9 - 11): <br /><i>Fireflies</i> - <s>These are very easy to kill, but are impervious (as far as I can tell) to magical attacks. SO the way to kill is Phantom Dart, damnation and then sacrifice Heal. These mobs are camped quite often though so you may be competing for them. Luckily unless another mage or archer is around you can usually engage the mob more quickly than any other mele class (that I came across anyway). The Fireflies I fought were in a cave at the far North-Western tip past Camp Bearded Rock but I have seen them in other caves also.</s> Went to try this out in retail and unfortunately the exp gained by fighting these mobs has been seriously nerfed :(. Was only getting normal exp (0-250) - for blue --&gt; red mobs. Still these mobs are not too risky to kill and drop fire shards if you need. <br /> <br />(levels 11-14): <br />After what seemed like an age (I did a few Levequests at Skull Valley camp) I found a very nice spot just north of the camp – so for those of you complaining about running to the aetherlyte all the time its right there! <br />Vs. <i>Roseling</i> – These can be tough but a decent THM can take them on. Just watch out for their detection range as it seems very far. <br />Mainly used Phantom Dart and Damnation with the Debuffs etc thrown in. You can easily go three to four mobs without getting mp drained – even more if you are good! I found one nice trick – don’t get too far away from them as their range attack hits for lots of dmg – move in close and preferably with your back to a wall (because they have a force back move). After a while I was getting very decent rank points (200-400) per kill. <br /> <br />(Levels 14+) <br />Mot done much yet but <i>Aldgoat Nanny</i> if you can beat them (and I did) can yield up to 500 Rank points per kill! <br />Try <i>Phorosfly’s</i> in the cave between Bloodshore and Cederwood zones. These are the Firefly’s older cousins but just as easy and decent rank points. <br /> <i>Bloodshore Bell</i> – Jellyfish and lots of them are north of Bloodshore camp. They don’t agro or link and as long as your def is good they can be taken down easily with PD+Damnation and Sacrifice. Seem immune to most other magic though.***Usually overcamped*** <br />***New Camp*** - Very good but needs a certain technique <br /><i> Moraby Mole</i> – These things hit hard At level 15 so be careful. I found a great camp thats perfect for this technique at 32 – 22/23 past the tunnel near Camp Bloodshore. Its a little circle between two areas and full of Mole’s  - plenty to kill. The technique I found was to use the following spells only &gt;&gt; PD&gt;Damnation&gt;Sacrifice. Build up your tp and use Damnation a lot because you’ll need to maintain your mp levels. Keep an eye on your hp – dont let it get into red. The moles will always do a range attack which hits for a lot first and then move in where they hit for a little less. The ‘technique’ though is for when they do their disappear and reappear move as this can hit for 275+ and can make things quite nasty. The zone that you are fighting these mobs in allows you to run out of their spawn range quite easily so you can avoid this move – sacrifice  - and move back for the kill. I leveled very quickly in what is I think a dry period for leveling [see above].  <br />(Levels 18-22) Still killing Bloodshore Bell's, however they are starting to run a little low on Rank points.... 49-259 for the last 2k at rank 18 - I may need new hunting grounds! <br />The swarm/mole/roseling camp past the tunnels near Bloodshore was good for a few k if you can take the generally low rank points :( <br />Casseopia Hollow <br /><i>Casseopia</i>’s can give decent exp – I found that if I could stand the grind its a good spot next to the Aetherlite Crystal – watch out for the Sea Hares on the way down though, they can one-shot you [not confirmed but I think this has been fixed now]. I found opening with Slow&gt;Scourge&gt;PD until Damnation gets you quite far with Sacrifice thrown in for good measure. <br />*** There are 4 Bombs/lightning Elementals  to the far west inside the Hollow . As a 22 THM I was able to take them down for extremely good and fast Rank points<s> (250-934) </s> . The Elementals give the most rank points but can be easier than the bombs which can be tricky as they hit faster. All mobs here cast Tier II magic so be very aware of this. I did die a lot here but the exp was so good it was worth it. Also worth noting that it appears that if you don't have buffs on and dont use magic attack spellsyou get more rank points. ***  <br /> <br />b) <span style="color:red">Thanalan</span> <br /> <br />Rank 1-8: Solo the Star Marmots, Copper Coblyns around Camp Blackbeard. Heading north of the camp yeilds quite a few mobs that are not being camped too much at the minute although these areas are becoming more popular. At these levels quick kills = quick ranking up - dont aim for anything higher. Around the east of Ul'dah is a small valley where I found quite a lot of mobs (Including beetles which can be nice rank points). Head out of the east gate and head south east from then on - its not far at all.  <br /> <br />Rank 8-10: Found this a very difficult level to rank up because you are not high enough for Dodo's yet. I went around Camp drybone and headed to the west of the map (near where you do the Yarzon leves) and fought coblyns and marmots again (Thistletails). If you look on you map in this area you will see some cave systems (shaped sort of like stars), inside here I found a bountiful supply of marmots. <br />7/8-10 A cave with two parts at 36/26-27 (the one just southwest of Camp Drybone) AWESOME xp - (credit to RhysOnKujata)  <br /> <br />10-13 I went to a cave at 39/18 (northeast of the golden bazaar on the same level as it is, you have to run through there to get to it.) Using both of these combined with the 2/3-7 spot of 22/29 allowed me to rush 3 different ranks to 12 in about 4 hours of nothing but grind time. <br />Rank 10-14: Dodo's - these are tough at 10 so be careful. Set slow and keep healing yourself as often as possible. At 11 you can just about manage the balance of dmg vs mp by using exaltation as often as the timer is up. Once you hit 12+ these are not too much of a problem and you can forgo the buffs/debuffs so save mp etc. Dodo's can give you up to 400+ rank points per kill and the fights can last a long time. I killed what was in the region while I was waiting for them to spawn. Honestly wasnt as slow as I thought it was going to be. <br />10-13 I went to a cave at 39/18 (northeast of the golden bazaar on the same level as it is, you have to run through there to get to it.) Using both of these combined with the 2/3-7 spot of 22/29 allowed me to rush 3 different ranks to 12 in about 4 hours of nothing but grind time.(credit to RhysOnKujata)  <br /> <br />Rank 14+: Ok at this point I am rank 16 and I have been working my way around camp horizon. The aldgoats here are red and too tough to fight but there are a few dodo's and lots of marmots here. I just circle around a wide area to find things to kill. I know this is a solo guide but if you can duo with a mele class (PUG very good) you can get fantastic skill ups vs the aldgoats. Just keep yourself on the opposite side of the goat of your teamate so when the goat uses the knockback move you can sacrifice while running forward to him to keep him alove. <br /> <br />Please add anything in the thread that you feel will help others and I will update. <br /> <br />c) <span style="color:red">Near Gridania</span> <br /> <br />TBA – Sorry as my character was created in Ul’Dah (previously in Limsa Lominsa) – I have never tried to solo in this area at any great length. There appears to be lots of low level marmots and various other mobs and looks like there is a quite a rich source of mobs, moving to the upper canopies when you reach R10+. (If anyone has any further information for this I would be very grateful) <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />8. <b>STATS</b> <br /> <br />If you are a mage and plan to solo at all it is thoughtful that you put some of your points into VIT and get gear that gives you more DEF. I have recently been doing this and it makes a big difference to your survivability. After recent testing I have concluded that for Phantom Dart (at least) added STR <u>does not</u> increase damage. The only stat I would definately raise is VIT to help with your survivability. <br /> <br /><b> The current thinking about stats is that although they seem broken THM benefit most by raising MND&gt;VIT&gt;PIE - Many players are still testing this but Your VIT,MND and PIE <i>should</i> be considerably more than any other stat. MND will give you a much larger MP pool which is not a bad thing but also let you Cure/Sacrifice people for more HP. VIT will increase your survivability greatly as it will raise your HP and also mitigate some damage done by mobs by inadvertantly raising your DEF.PIE will help your debuffs stick and seems to increase damage on our nukes. INT does not seem to play much of a role for a THM at the minute believe it or not. INT is better used by CON's to raise the damage of their nukes. You should not raise this by much if at all</b> <br /> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />9. <span style="color:purple">MACRO'S</span> <br /> <br />Going to improve this section very soon but just for now I'll add two important ones that I've found very useful. Each have a separate binding for: <br /> <br />/aoe on <br />/aoe off <br /> <br />These are great in party situations so your THM can quickly switch from party heal, single target heal and aoe  debuffs when no other mobs are around. <br /> <br />There are two ways of selecting your spells, one is through the keyboard numbers 1 through 10 (0) then hitting enter to cast the spell and the other is through macro's. So a macro for Aoe Scourge would look like this:  <br /> <br />/aoe on  <br />/action &quot;Scourge&quot; main &lt;t&gt;  <br /> <br />and obviously 'off' for single target  <br /> <br />*** When you use this method you do not have to hit enter, you do not see a green icon or a purple circle. *** <br /> <br />My recommendation (and this is personal preference but I feel it orders me well) is that your macro’s use the first two rows, CTRL being your main Cures (1-4 set for Sacrifice I, Cure I, Sacrifice II and Cure II) and ALT being for your buffs/debuffs such as Punishing Barbs, Exhaltation etc. Here is how mine are currently layed out: <br /> <br />CTRL+1     = Sacrifice <br />CTRL+2     = Cure  <br />CTRL+3     = Sacrifice II <br />CTRL+4     = Cure II <br />CTRL+5     = Protect and Shell <br />CTRL+6-0   not used as of yet. <br />ALT+1     = Aoe off <br />ALT+2     = Aoe On <br />ALT+3     = Exaltation <br />ALT+4     = Stoneskin <br />ALT+5     = Punishing Barbs <br />ALT+6     = Shock Spikes <br />ALT+7     = Stygian Spikes <br />ALT+8     = Siphon MP <br />ALT+9     = Profundity <br />ALT+0     = Drain <br /> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />10. <span style="color:deepskyblue">The Soloist vs The Party mage</span> <br /> <br /><u>Soloist Thaumaturge</u> <br /> <br />So far on my travels I have played solo (especially when I first started Alpha through to the beginning of Beta3). I have found as a solo mage there were some things I could do well and some things I could do really well!  <br /> <br />Spell Combinations: <br />Sacrifice&gt;Phantom Dart&gt;Damnation&gt;Punishing Barbs&gt;Slow&gt;Scourge/Banish <br />I would say at early levels (1-10) these are the best combinations I can find. PD and damnation are your bread and butter hitting spells that take JP off the mob and Sacrifice is the spell that saves you most of the time. Punishing Barbs is a great spell but you have to time it right. I only ever really use it as a soloist if the mobs is hitting harder than I first thought it would after I had engaged it, or, it is part a group/link set of mobs and want to do some damage to the others while I attack one target, or if I am faced with a powerful mob that builds up its TP to basically one shot me – this is useful on difficult leves because although you’ll die, as long as you have time you most likely will kill the mob with this spell and be ready by the time you get back to camp. I have never got any skill points off it when it was active so bear this in mind also. Slow is a fantastic spell for a solo THM, it slows down the mob to a crawl and most often sticks. This can really help you get a hit&gt;hit&gt;heal combination going and stay on top of the battle. Its timer can often last less than the cooldown, which is its only downfall. Scourge and Banish are a THM ‘s nukes and can hit for quite high numbers, I always have one set, if not both. <br /> <br />As you get higher in levels there are some very good spells for soloing such as Stygian Spikes – which can virtually mean you can nuke freely up to a point (especially since the exaltation timer has been decreased to ten minutes from 30).  Poison is a spell you get quite early on and I feel is underused as it is quite potent, usually sticks for a reasonable amount of time and doesn’t cost much mp, so its dmg/mp ratio is quite good. Blood Rite I have found recently to be a great addition as it really helps those spells get that little bit more damage.  Again a good one to set if you have the spare slots. <br /> <br />Now some spells have yet to prove themselves to me. Siphon MP can net you quite a lot of mp return if the mob is weak to magic or low enough, but often you will want to be fighting mobs that are at least decent prey because of the rank point rewards so I have found that having it set doesn’t outweigh the benefits of setting other spells in its place. If you are going to be a total nuker then maybe set with other spells this would be of benefit but unless you in a party it may not be worth it as stated. Bio and Dia, although have moderate benefits do not seem as potent in FFXIV as they were in FFXI, this is not to say that I don’t set them but they are only there if I have spare slots. Dark Seal is a spell that although it works well in getting a hit for a debuff etc as it only is there for one cast its 3 points is not really worth it at this stage. Maybe in the future when THM’s are higher in rank and fighting in large group it will prove invaluable. But for the solo mage its not a great spell. All of the Absorb spell have such a small amount of longevity it really doesn’t seem worth casting them and testing this spell with initiation and the fact that the party member receiving the benefit gets it for a very short time makes it redundant and obviously you would set initiation as a soloer anyway! <br /> <br /><u>Party Thaumaturge</u> <br />In my mind the Party THM is where the serious SP is at. You'll be fighting some amazing and tough mobs and I found this to be the most exciting and least repetitive (although I must admit to be getting sick of Efts).It is important to note that there is a big difference with a THM in a Battleleve and in an SP Party. <br /> <br />[Battleleves] <br />The Thaumaturge in a party is a difficult class to master at first. With the amount of emnity sacrifice and any debuff AoE's can generate you'll end up spending most of your shared-leves face down. With some careful playcraft you can eliminate this and mitigate any emnity (up to a point!). I find that using macro's is the key to being a party THM and keeping an eye on single target and aoe is essential. When in a battle situation make sure you tell any party members that they must wait for all buffs to be placed before they engage or else risk losing one of their team mates early on in the fray. Once engaged I found the tactic of initially waiting and then  hitting a few Phantom Darts to be a good way into the fight. Obviously as its a party the dynamics will depend on who you are with, what class they are and the party member total. Set AoE Sacrifice and when people look like they are around 50% hit it. By then you should be low on the hate list and will help out any CON that is trying to heal and nuke etc. Again in a party situation Slow is your freind and is still the debuff of choice (until you ge to higher levels of course). Don't forget that Stygian Spikes over write Shock Spikes so if you want to cast this at all (which you probably dont!) then make sure you do it away from the other players! One of the very popular techniques I have used as a party THM is Punishing Barbs - my team has won many a 5 star leve with me going in on a group of very tough mobs, everyone concentrating fire onto one mob and them getting hit with a large single damage hit which in turn reflects a considerable amount of damage back to the mob. On a dmg for dmg ratio you are looking at doing around 10X the damage of Scourge or Banish using this spell, and of course if you can survive that first hit then the second hit usually finishes off the mob for good. Expect to miss out on some rank points doing this though as you are constantly running back from the aetherlyte and cooling down your PB timer while your teamates might still be fighting and getting skill ups. Of course when you get the guildmarks its quite worthwhile to buy Silouette, as again you can deal out more damage to mobs and not get as much hate. At present it seems like us THM's are very good at emnity generation! I'm hopeing SE will fix this somehow in the future and allow us to at least aoe debuff if we desire. <br /> <br />[SP Party] <br /><s>I have found these non-leve fights much more like traditional party setups on FFXI (If you have played this you will know what I mean). Here you cast Sacrifice and Cure aoe to cure yourself (if needed) and the tank, which is very useful as most mobs are not a good idea to be in front of. I have partied with all of the classes and they all have their +/-'s. DOM classes can get equal skillups as our DOW counterparts but we have to be clever about it :) For example at 16-20 I was ranking up nearly two times faster than my team mates. I would say depending on the party you can expect an average of around 300SP per fight if you use the following methods and try and instruct your party in the ways of the mage: <br /> <br />1. Sacrifice 1 and Cure 1 only if more than 1 mage in party. Only use Tier II's if absolutely needed. <br />2. Stygian Spikes as often as you like (just remember that overwriting a buff <i>doesn't</i> net you SP!(ty Miayr) <br />3. Profundity + Scourge/Banish whenever its up - can net 250-300sp for just one successful hit. <br />4. Scourge/Banish when profundity is not up. <br />5. Siphon MP (not for SP gain but to keep MP up) when mob is dead (this gets you much more MP most of the time) <br />6. Spirit Dart/Phantom Dart when you get chance.(Again using Profundity here can get you a bigger hit and more SP) <br />7. Damnation/Radiance when you get the chance. <br />8. Protect and Shell during fight only if possible (does get you SP) - sometimes Protect is not needed though and can hurt SP! <br />9. ABS EVA can always be used but DEF/ACC can be situational depending on mob. I wouldnt recommend using ABS ATT because mob will hit people for less and it has no benifit for anyone on the team. <br />10. Dia not Bio (again depending on situation). Dia has chance of double proc similar to Scourge/Banish. <br />11. Any other debuffs you can manage that dont hurt your own SP gain - If you have time after all of the above! <br /> <br />Make sure that any other mages in your group understand these rules. <br />Make sure mele in your group dont use stun moves on mob, try to get them not to use anything that gives them HP back or DEF if you can!, and try to stop them using absorb/deplete TP moves as you want the mob to hit them with aoe! :) <br /> <br />I said previously 300SP per fight average, but if you hit the 'sweet spot' - being around the middle level in your party, not having many other mages and no Archers (sorry but you really gimp our SP) you can easily cap SP every fight.</s> <br /> <br />******** NOTE: This all became moot after the November 24th 2010 update! *********** <br /> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />11. <span style="color:darkcyan">TESTING:</span> <br />Deleted Sction as this appears to have been fixed to some degree! <br />Any further ideas as always please post and I'll add and credit. <br /> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />12.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Well finally made it to 25! Was hoping to go all the way but the surplus got me!  <br /> <br />I've really enjoyed playing my THM and have tested many aspects of it. I have posted in the feedback over time things that I think are problems and have put in quite a few bug reports. <br /> <br />I will be playing it for retail I hope but there are a few things that I sincerely hope they get right - or else the class could be broken before it gets started. I'm sure subsequent patches will be made by SE. <br /> <br />Hope to continue for Beta but dont expect too much as its such a short time. I may go and try some synths if they sort out the GUI - maybe try and make the first Scepter!

The lag on your HP/MP bar updating was incredible-- sometimes getting hit didnt reflect in your bar for 3 seconds. This made keeping track of combat rather tricky, so eventually I just cast Sac on myself after every second hit basically.  <br /> <br />There was a couple of occasions where I'd get hit, look at my bar and think &quot;still a bit left&quot; then try and cure myself after the next hit and realise I cant, because my HP is below the 50 required by Sac.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">To Rubina: <br /> <br />1) Yes using Sacrifice and Cure (only reason to use cure is when you get to certain levels of red hp you cannot cats Sacrifice so this saved my life quite a few times). The massive attack they do does usually occur when they are about 75% down on hp. I handled it as a THM by always using Punishing Barbs which hits the mobs for what they hit you for - often would finish them off while I was busy curing. I did level off the nannies a few times but it wasnt the easiest of the mobs to continously use. Never really exp'd off the Dodo's though, only ever fought them for [fun]! <br /> <br />2) When do you start seeing leves that start giving guild marks as part of the reward? Also where do you cash in those marks for your job? <br />I think it was the rank 30 guildleves - you have to be rank 20 to get them. There is a Roegadyn on the bridge leading out of Limsa that you cash your marks in with - most of the classes have an npc on that bridge I think. <br /> <br />3. Vs. Roselings - I think they lowered the number in Beta3 - I mainly used them in Beta two although there were a few areas that had 2-3 roselings that I found, north of skull valley, south of skull valley and south west of bearded rock. <br /> <br />Kordain - yes the lag in Beta meant you had to often 'predict' how much and when you were going to be hit and sometimes the lag would still get you. veyr frsutrating but part of the Beta I suppose :)<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179">Loadstone Profile</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649" rel="external" title="ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649">Thaumaturge Guide</a> <br /> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/1229110.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Thank you for your answers. Just a few more annoying questions. When you were leveling post L.10, were you hunting near one of the camps so you can use a lot of mana or were you relying upon your wielded weapon plus your TP ability to recover some mana? I was trying both out with Conj and I found you can go forver just using your wielded weapon and recovering mana from the TP move to recoup mana from shock spikes and cures. But the down side was I really didn't feel like a mage, just pinging away with my weapon and curing as needed. Also I was limited on the type of mobs that I can safely grind against when I want to hunt with limited mana use. Things did get a lot easier when I upgraded to a maple wand. I noticed that TP generated alot faster and I it was doing twice the damamge per attack. But hunting the goats at L.18 by Bearded Rock was a lot of fun and but it could be dangerous. Of course I had to burn through mana to take them down. I could take on 3-4 before I had to limp back to camp for a recharge. <br /> <br />I will go back and try Thaumaturge again during OB. I think I was slightly put off by the fact it looks like they only had two nukes. Is there a debuff that you all found that worked best when you solo? I experimented with Poison, Dia and Bio. But I always wondered if they were worth it because you don't get XP for all the damage those debuffs do overtime. Also is it even worth casting debuffs on mobs that you can solo? Wouldn't it be more efficient just to use that mana to use a nuke?  <br /> <br />Did you notice if you recieved any job/physical XP when you cast your Sacarafice spell while solo or on a team? <br /> <br />I think it's going to be a lot of fun learning and playing both THM/CON.  <br /> <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">No problems - I'll help out as much as I can! :) <br /> <br />First time round this most recent Beta was tough post-10 - however I found that if you level on firefly's and are very conservative with your magic (only use for sacrifice and calculate when you optimum time to cast is), spamming PD + Sacrifice can keep you going for quite some time. Another thing to note was that in Beta anyways it 'seemed' that you got more skillups as a THM if you used physical attacks rather than magic (although this could be just because I ws being conservative with mp!). I know its not very mage-like to do it this way but found 10-14 a real grind the first time around. Of course the other alternative (and I did do this too) was to get into a party of Guildleves - you can quite easily get a few low ranks this way in a single sitting if the party balance is right). Once you have got your THM to 16 though leveing any other calss is very easy (including CON) as Stygian SPikes is still a very good MP recoverer for any job - I used this for CON/MAR/ARC and PUG (setting SACrifice or Cure and stygian spikes) <br /> <br />I had the maple wand too and noticed the difference in TP gain  - usually 2 hits for 100tp on decent challenge mobs - whereas my Weathered Scepter (rank1) was taking maybe 4-5 hits sometimes. One trick I very quickly learned was every time I went back to Limsa I would sell my old one back to the shop and buy a new one - this would improve things. I am sure that in Retail (hopefully OB too!) we will have a much larger choice of THM weapons - this will make us even more powerful! <br /> <br />Is there a debuff that you all found that worked best when you solo?  <b>Yes definately SLOW was the best one.</b> <br /> <br />I tried all the types of buffs solo but found they were only useful on harder party mobs as they actually were doing something productiove. Smaller easier mobs in a party they were hardly worth doing because the mob was down too quickly. I found that DIA, Poison and Scourge then damnation was a good combo but very mp hungry. For some reason DIA+ Scourge and Bio+Banish worked better - dont ask me why but lots of things were messed up in Beta. For instance the difference between Tier II Banish and Scourge compared to Tier I was negligable at best. <br /> <br />Did you notice if you recieved any job/physical XP when you cast your Sacarafice spell while solo or on a team? I did get THM proficiency when casting Sacrifice but like I said before the percentage of casting you do compared to physical attacks is very different so it would probably proc a lot more if I used a lot more if you see what I mean? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I think it's going to be a lot of fun learning and playing both THM/CON.  <br />Totally agree! and for me although I have a preference for THM as my main the CON is a great class also :)<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179">Loadstone Profile</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649" rel="external" title="ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649">Thaumaturge Guide</a> <br /> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/1229110.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Origianl post by: Rubina <br /> <br />&quot;Once I start leveling both mage classes, I like to compare Stygian Spikes to Shock Spikes. I found Shock Spikes to be a great defensive buff. It's really cool seeing mob's attacks being stopped because they're paralyzed. But the one thing I found is that buffs that are not in your current active job don't last as long, which in turns requires more mana to cast in the long run. I also want to remember that casting cure outsideo f your current job isn't as effective.&quot; <br /> <br />Both spells are sort of the opposite of each other and of course one overides the other :(  I found shock spikes great for solo when I wasnt running low on MP (in fact I often had both spells equiped and used shock when I wanted and Stygian when I needed). But Stygian on  fully blown THM was getting so much mp back from them (was around constant 23mp per hit post 16) - this meant you could spam Sacrifice and <i>still</i> have a full mp bar after a fight. Honest dont underestimate it. However - there is a flip side. Some mobs that spam some ranged attacks or dont attack that often but attack hard (elementals for instance) Stygian may not be the most efficient of the two. Its definately worth further testing. Another point is that whenever I was in a party I would choose Shock over Stygian every time unless we were all mage! <br /> <br />Sorry for the way I am quoting you - completely forgoten how to quote somebody properly and cant see instructions on the site that explain it! :) <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Aug 28th 2010  2:24pm by EdyNOTB </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179">Loadstone Profile</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649" rel="external" title="ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649">Thaumaturge Guide</a> <br /> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/1229110.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Sheep in limsa are still good for soloing. However, salamanders now aggro and the closest aetheryte node is blocked by salamanders, so you have to walk all the way back from Bearded Rock if you die. There is also a gobbue that aggros in the area, but it's not hard to avoid. Sheep also drop a lot of wind shards, which if you are a crafter from Ul'dah, you might need, as they are hard to find in Thanalan. <div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>FFXIV: <a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=1259974" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=1259974">Chrys Tsuji</a>-Rabanastre </div></div>

I know that the meletankmage is something I've been hearing about recently but alas I have not tried a shield out for quite some time, the main reason being that last time I tried the shield seemed to take up all my TP when I had it out, therefore I was unable to spam Damnation etc. However people I have met recently and in the last Beta raved about its potential so I would like to know more. If you get any info about its usefulness in the life of a THM I would greatly appreciate feedback here as well as on the main forum. If you dont get time let me know and I'll try and set out testing myself although I have a friend in Linkshell that is already rank 3 shield and he says it <i>very</i> difficult to raise points on it.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179">Loadstone Profile</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649" rel="external" title="ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649">Thaumaturge Guide</a> <br /> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/1229110.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Hey, thank you very much for this guide. <br /> <br />That said, <br /> <br />What stat buffs the phantom dart? <br /> <br />I am confused about this one, I ask because its our primary skill point getting ability so I find myself spamming it most of the time, but is it intelligence based or is it strength based attack? <br /> <br />I know the weapon itself says its magic potency bla bla bla but when u hit with it, is it based on strength? Just for spirit dart alone that is. <br /> <br />If someone can help clarify that it be really nice. <br /> <br />Thank you! <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 10th 2010 10:54pm by ffxivgyshal </span></i></div>

Just for spirit dart alone that is. <br /> <br />If someone can help clarify that it be really nice. <br /> <br />Thank you! <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 10th 2010 10:54pm by ffxivgyshal </span></i></div></div> <br /> <br />Thank you and I hope it has been of some use to you. :) <br /> <br />Regarding your very valid question about what stats affect the potency of Phantom Dart the short answer is that I don't fully know yet, however a few things have seen increases in the damage output of the action. The problem is often increases are in conjunction with increases in rank so its hard to tell without any specific testing on this. At present in Open Beta I have been spending time exploring and not leveling THM like I did in the last beta, I was waiting for retail before this. Anyway these are things I have so far observed (but certainly not tested so its open for further discussion and testing): <br /> <br />1. When you upgrade your weapon you see an increase in damage output. <br />2. When your weapon is fully repaired you see an increase in damage output. <br />3. Quantity of damage is related to TP gain. <br />4. Rank increases damage output. <br />5. Under Magic Hand Attack (Physical attributes) an increase improves damage output. <br /> <br />What is unclear and needs further testing is if STR alone increases damage output. There seems to be a split opinion too that Phantom Dart is actually a physical move and not a magic move. I think its physical atm so I have increased my STR but out of all the points it has always been my lowest stat (DEX beating it just because its more important to hit everytime than to hit slightly harder but less often). <br /> <br />Anyhow I'm sure people have their own theories and tests, so hopefully this will all become clearer over time. <br /> <br />****EDIT**** <br /> <br />After posting this I decided to put my theory to the test. <br /> <br />Rank 12 THM <br />Decorated Copper Scepter (main) <br />Used Phantom Dart only <br /> <br />40 PIE, INT, MND <br />23 STR <br /> <br />Was hitting mobs that checked as blue for between 192-221 <br /> <br />Reassigned as many points as I could to STR (24 points) <br /> <br />36 PIE, INT, MND <br />40 STR <br /> <br />Was hitting mobs that checked as blue for between 150-175 <br /> <br />It was only a small test but I think that it shows that STR <u>does not</u> increase damage output on Phantom Dart. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 11th 2010  6:59am by EdyNOTB </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179">Loadstone Profile</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649" rel="external" title="ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649">Thaumaturge Guide</a> <br /> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/1229110.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

Again further testing required. The only stat north of INT that I would put points into is VIT as this helps a ton with damage mitigation and if you plan on soloing and party play (like I already am) then having a high VIT is pretty important. <br /> <br />Another important thing to note is that STR and DEX may in fact play a role with the THM and other types of spells/actions. So little is known yet about the internal dynamics of the classes thats its to early to make assumtions about anything :)<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179">Loadstone Profile</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649" rel="external" title="ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649">Thaumaturge Guide</a> <br /> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/1229110.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

Once you get used to use every spell has a double use! Great for swtiching between sacrifice and scourge or slow for example when there are mobs that are around that you dont want to hit.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179">Loadstone Profile</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649" rel="external" title="ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649">Thaumaturge Guide</a> <br /> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/1229110.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

There is no need for this if you have designated it as on or off it should stay that way and not require me to confirm it via pressing enter.  I can see this being more acceptable on a gamepad but as a keyboard user not so much. I tried to change the enter key but I had no such luck, maybe to S or something just for more convience but if your using a mouse and keyboard hitting enter every spell is plain annoying and not good game play.</div>

There is no need for this if you have designated it as on or off it should stay that way and not require me to confirm it via pressing enter.  I can see this being more acceptable on a gamepad but as a keyboard user not so much. I tried to change the enter key but I had no such luck, maybe to S or something just for more convience but if your using a mouse and keyboard hitting enter every spell is plain annoying and not good game play.</div></div> <br /> <br />Right I see where you are coming from now. You dont like the fact you have to press enter to execute the spell. <br /> <br />I just got used to it in the end and sometimes its not a bad thing. Quite often in the heat of a battle I have accidentaly hit the wrong key and quickly pressed esc to stop the spell, selected the new one and hit enter. I remember in one of the Beta's, maybe Beta 2 you didnt have to do this. I liked it better to be honest because when you hit your macro key the spell just went off right there and then, no messing about.  <br /> <br />There are two ways of selecting you spells, one is through the keyboard numbers 1 through 10 (0) then hitting enter to cast the spell and the other is through macro's. After your last post I went to check this out and you do not need to press enter for any spell when it is cast Aoe <i>provided</i> you do not use the keyboard selection method. So a macro for Aoe Scourge would look like this: <br /> <br />/aoe on <br />/action &quot;Scourge&quot; main &lt;t&gt; <br /> <br />and obviously 'off' for single target <br /> <br />When you use this method you do not have to hit enter, you do not see a green icon or a purple circle. <br /> <br />I would recommend a row for AoE spells and a row for single target spells if you dont want to have to be hitting enter all the time. Before each macro line to cast the spell you would first have to tell it aoe on/off. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sep 17th 2010 12:07pm by EdyNOTB </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=2993179">Loadstone Profile</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649" rel="external" title="ffxiv.zam.com/forum.html?forum=179&amp;mid=1282291867193441649">Thaumaturge Guide</a> <br /> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/1229110.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>
