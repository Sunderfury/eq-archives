      <div class="msgContentFrame">Well I think I finally have a decent grasp of what I'm doing behind the shield and think I might have a few tips for any up and coming GLA's . First things first I know I don't know everything and not everything I put down might be correct or completely accurate so feel free to point out any shortcomings or to simply make some suggestions. I know two heads are better then one so please barring personal attacks on me I'm open ears lol. <br /> <br /><u><b>First Things First</b></u> <br /> <br />What abilities do I REALLY need for certain situations ? Well this can greatly differ as you might imagine. When solo'n there will always be a few spells you might want equipped you might not need in a party situation. For example for fast hard hitting mobs that you might be skilling your shield up on you would need Protect/Shell/Shock Spikes where as if you had a main healer (con/thm) they would hopefully have these spells baring they are at least 16. If you do not have protect/shell I highly suggest leveling your conj to at least 16 as this can be extremely beneficial. Just one example is farming lady bugs near tranquil I went from taking 400+ damage from Magic Based tp moves to around 100. I don't claim that shell gives a 75% mitigation, this was highly due to a cap'd MND (resist factor), but it was very consistently low compared to the mage above me taking 500 or so. I'll do some more testing to give some more scientific numbers as I know that's want everyone wants. Ok now I got protect/shell, well for me personally as much as I like relying on healers I fell a good tank can self-sustain for a good bit of time when healers get in trouble (i.e out of MP, or stuck in Battle Regimen mode and cant get out lol). So if you already got con to 16 take it to 20 for Cure II. This will also help on BZ'n &lt;---barb zerging I've done my research and no one else has called it this on the internet so its mine :). Simply being able to stack cure/cure II when BZ'n can make a huge difference. <br /> <br />Ok I'm tired of lvl'n mage classes now what. Well hopefully you have some other jobs lvl'd if not take the time and level everything to ten, especially Marauder/Pugilist. Spell such as defender can greatly reduce damage taken especially when stacked with defense spells like rampart/sentinel. I also think having blood bath can be very helpful especially in the future when you get higher damaging WS's , and can be quite nice HP return when stacking with Still Precision =&gt; Radiance, this gives you not only decent HP return but also MP. As far as Pugilist , Second Wind is amazing for only 250 TP and a decently low timer can really add up on MP conservation for you and your party. And well I dont think you can be taken seriously if you don't have Taunt its amazing and double stacking with provoke to start a fight will keep you from losing that inital hate when a mage goes and casts some AOE spell on the party or Profundity =&gt; Slow and then gets rocked, and starts cure bombing himself out of panic and thus just makes the problem work. Trust me , just get it. Last but not least, we all know its a pain, but level your shield and get Aegis Boon and Shield Bash. One gives decent HP return on hard hitting mobs while the other can pretty much stop a mob in its tracks or interrupt a big AOE magic spell about to go off, i.e lady bug nukes. <br /> <br /><u> <br /><b>Combat Scenario</b></u> <br /> <br />Ok now I got all these spells so how to I use them together in a fight. <br /> <br />If you've done long grinding parties before then you know eventually you will get in a groove and be pretty much on auto-pilot. But getting into that rhythm can be sometimes a bit of a struggle if you are a bit new to a job, so this is what I suggest doing. <br /> <br /><u><b>Beginner</b></u> <br /> <br />Focus on just keeping hate. Most of the times the higher lvl's mages will recognize you needing a bit more help and will focus more on curing you then spamming SD and nukes. And the efficient ones will appreciate this as they know the fastest way to really lvl is to cure Bomb on hard hitting mobs like crabs, and will appreciate our noviceness (not a word I know). Also don't be afraid to let the party/mages know you are new and that you are still working on getting your macros setup and getting into the swing of things. This is not a sign of weakness but one of maturity and will definitely for the most part make people want to help you more knowing that you want to learn. I would suggest having 4 basic macros for now <br /> <br /><u>Provoke</u> <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Provoke&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Provoke&quot; &lt;st&gt; (multiple mobs , aggro) I prefer this one as the tab funciton atm is a bit broken <br /> <br /><u>Taunt</u> <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Taunt&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Taunt&quot; &lt;st&gt; <br /> <br /><u>Provoke/Taunt</u> - If your getting comfortable and need the room I suggest combining these. <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Provoke&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/wait 2 <br />/ac &quot;Taunt&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br /> <br />(wait not needed if you dont experience any macro lag) <br /> <br /><u>Guard/Attack</u> <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Guard&quot; sub &lt;me&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; (stab is more acc imho over slash, also I suggest using a dagger early on as they are more accurate and stacks with piercing damage which stab is) <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Guard&quot; sub &lt;me&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Radiance&quot; &lt;t&gt; (w/e WS you choose, I prefer this for the MP return) <br />/echo RESTART YOUR MACRO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /><u>Cure(II)</u> <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Cure&quot; &lt;me&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Cure II&quot; &lt;me&gt; <br /> <br /><u><b>Intermediate</b></u> <br /> <br />Ok now you are getting the basics down its times to move on. You should be comfortable with keeping hate and with taunt/provoke both at your disposal its time to start really making GLA your own. Start by really focusing on you HP and trying to mitigate as much damage as possible this will make your non Healing mages happy as they can focus on what they want to and give them the option to choose what they focus on. Try and start working on your timing and focus on &quot;Keeping Yourself Alive&quot; almost if you were solo'n. Use second wind as soon as you can assuming you have taken 200+ damage . Use rampart immediately so the start of the fight, the most chaotic part of the fight, easy going and let people get setup. Also keep defender up as this will greatly reduce your damage taken greatly over time and can really be helpful when low on HP and stacked with rampart. So focus on all the macros ideas above plus the following <br /> <br /><u>Second Wind</u> <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Second Wind&quot; &lt;me&gt; <br />/recast &quot;Second Wind&quot; <br /> <br />Assuming you have 250 TP which you pretty much always should <br /> <br /><u>Defender</u> <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Defender&quot; &lt;me&gt; <br /> <br /><u>Rampart</u> <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Rampart&quot; &lt;me&gt; <br />/recast &quot;Rampart <br /> <br /><u>Phalanx</u> <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Guard&quot; sub &lt;me&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Phalanx&quot; &lt;me&gt;  Great way to deal good damage and keep damage up if you are going shield heavy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Lets you know how much more time you have before you can use if not up. <br /> <br /><u><b>Advanced</b></u> <br /> <br />Ok so now you are really starting to become a GLA and party members really feel like you have a grasp on what you are doing , but now its time to be the guy people send /tells to when its party time. So how do you get there. Well now its time to become a self-sustaining machine and be the person that is asked to take more damage so they can get more SP for curing you. This is when you know your coming into your own. It is time to use all the tools at your disposal. Now you can start focusing on doing more damage and relying on your abilities to save you not when you necessarily want to but need to. Save your ramparts for when you are really in danger low Yellow/Red HP and use your cure and cure II to your advantage. For me when I'm getting low I'll try and stack a Second Wind/Cure II/Cure combo and get about 600 Hp back within about 7/8 seconds. I also try and stay capp'd when I can. Start stacking your skills to get the most out of them. If you are just straight going for damage mitigation then I would suggest following the steps above and using all your abilities when you can upfront and make the transition slowly until you and your party get in a groove. <br /> <br /><u><b>Weapon skills</b></u> <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Still Precision&quot; &lt;me&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Blood Bath&quot; &lt;me&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Radiance&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br /> <br />This will give you a higher chance of landing with ACC+ as well as HP/MP return if landed. Add waits if you have macro lag <br /> <br /><u><b> <br />Aegis Boon</b></u> -edited <br /> <br />/ac &quot;Aegis Boon&quot; &lt;me&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Guard&quot; sub &lt;me&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br />/ac &quot;Light Stab&quot; &lt;t&gt; <br /> <br />This will give you the most out of your Aegis as you will keep attacking as well as have your shield up for the most part. Add waits if you have macro lag in between guard and aegis. <br /> <br />As far as stats go here is what I suggest. <br /> <br />VIT - Keep it capp'd our only as good as your HP and damage reduction let you be <br />MND - Keep it capp'd greatly allows you to be more self sustained allowing yourself to cure bomb when needed.Also reduces damage on magic attacks. Also keeps novice mages from getting themselves into to much trouble when they get hit. <br />STR - I prefer to high this high as well, as SE recently announced this is a variable in how much damage you block when your shield proc's <br />DEX - good for ACC, but damage is not your main concern on GLA at least for basic parties. You can go a whole fight not hit a mob once and still never lost hate <br />Int/Pie - not of big importance if you had to choose one choose PIE. Based on resisting Magic attacks however to make this really noticeable you would probably have to put quite a few points into it, so this is your call. <br /> <br /><u><b>Last Remarks</b></u> <br /> <br />* This is not the only way to tank, these are a few ways to help in the tank process <br />* Don't wear bronze/vintage hauby's or off class gear like bone scale mail at lvl 14 ya you look cool but your doing nothing but hindering yourself form the start. Keep your gear at a max 5+ Lvls. <br />* Don't be afraid to ask questions <br />* Don't ever get stuck doing something one way (those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it) <br />* Make sure your buffed by your mages before you start a fight <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  8th 2010 10:53am by MavenRedux </span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  8th 2010 10:57am by MavenRedux </span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 15th 2010  1:23pm by MavenRedux </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><u><b>Linkshell :</b></u><a href="http://www.Fidens-ls.com" rel="external nofollow" title="http://www.Fidens-ls.com">www.Fidens-ls.com</a> <br />[img]<a href="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg" title="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg</a>[/img]</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Not to be a negative Nancy, but if I found out the tank in my group was doing everything by multi-action macros, I'd replace them.  Tanking done well is dynamic.  Also, I don't really want to be in a group with a Gladiator tank who knows more about writing macros than basic fundamentals about the class like when and how to use Phalanx.  I'll take Stygian Spikes over Radiance to recover MP any day of the week.  In fact, with Stygian Spikes I can typically recover MP faster than I can use it. <br /> <br />We're give action bars in this game for a reason.  For me, action macros are what I use so that I can access a second &quot;row&quot; of actions without actually having to cycle my action bar.  They aren't something I string together to play the game for me. <br /> <br />Not trying to be mean but as a novice guide all this will do is teach people bad habits.  Experienced tanks know better.  There's a low stamina tanking guide here in the Gladiator forums that is well written and offers some great advice on builds and methods that will blow this macro-dependent shenanigan out of the water.  I appreciate the effort and others might find this useful, but personally I think you're trying too hard to teach people something you know little about.</div>

I favor the reactive kind of build because it's more fun for me to have to be watching for a variety of circumstances and responding appropriately.  That's why I put my gladiator on the shelf (again) and ranked up MRD and PGL to 14 for their reactive, low TP, low stamina requirement weapon skills (Fracture and Jarring Strike).

Try as you might, you're never going to be able to keep Guard up 100% of the time, so what can you do when you get the parries or evades in between?

How can you build the most threat for the least stamina so that you've got a stamina reserve in the event of an emergency?

Tanking done well is dynamic.  Also, I don't really want to be in a group with a Gladiator tank who knows more about writing macros than basic fundamentals about the class like when and how to use Phalanx.  I'll take Stygian Spikes over Radiance to recover MP any day of the week.  In fact, with Stygian Spikes I can typically recover MP faster than I can use it. <br /> <br />We're give action bars in this game for a reason.  For me, action macros are what I use so that I can access a second &quot;row&quot; of actions without actually having to cycle my action bar.  They aren't something I string together to play the game for me. <br /> <br />Not trying to be mean but as a novice guide all this will do is teach people bad habits.  Experienced tanks know better.  There's a low stamina tanking guide here in the Gladiator forums that is well written and offers some great advice on builds and methods that will blow this macro-dependent shenanigan out of the water.  I appreciate the effort and others might find this useful, but personally I think you're trying too hard to teach people something you know little about.</div></div> <br /> <br />1- Macro writing can be dynamic , and a good tank can switch macros on call if they understand the way the client/server dynamic works, you can kill a macro and switch by double hitting your macro. I do it all the time. As for Styg Spikes this will just take place of Tanking based abilities that a THM could be giving you in a well setup party. <br /> <br />2- I guarantee I can access my macros for my 2nd/3rd row of abilities with my game controller faster then you can using the action bar. As far as playing the game for you by all means if you want to be inefficient go for it, but &quot;We're given macros spaces in this game for a reason&quot;. <br /> <br />3- Low stamina guides are good in theory but as far as application goes, especially trying to level up they are inefficent, tanking is truly built on two thing, keeping hate, and mitagation. Taunt/provoke method is the best pound for pound stamina usage for hate and this has been tested with ARC's 7 levle's higher then me just trying to pull hate off. <br /> <br />4- The best tanks are active not reactive they know whats going to happen before it happens they know the thresholds, the dynamics, the TP moves to expect, and know how to keep spamming enmity based moves to never have to worry about the what ifs, and have macros setup for the just in case's like second wind/cure ii/cure <br /> <br />5- I'm pretty sure you've never done a full out spam attack macro to see that it is way faster and counter-acts the client/server based lag that is inherently built into this game. I want to see you preform 8 attacks before someone who has 10 lines of /ac &quot;Attack&quot; &lt;t&gt; , you'll find you are way off <br /> <br /> <br />oh and the little lalafell that just got 1shotted  because you were being &quot;reactive&quot; / trying to keep more stamina / and trying to find a certain ability in your action bar that looks like 4 others just called and wants his life back :) <br /> <br />@ Kal  <br />Bingo...  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  9th 2010 10:12am by MavenRedux </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><u><b>Linkshell :</b></u><a href="http://www.Fidens-ls.com" rel="external nofollow" title="http://www.Fidens-ls.com">www.Fidens-ls.com</a> <br />[img]<a href="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg" title="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg</a>[/img]</div></div>

I can queue my next attack while one is in progress and it will go off as soon as the game will allow it to go off.  Repeat 8 times and my attack sequence will be just as fast as the macro attack sequence, only in my case I'm better able to pace those attacks so that I'm not consistently stamina dry and I don't have to worry about canceling one macro and keying another to change up what I'm trying to do.

And the little Lalafel is much less likely to get one-shot because I'll actually have Taunt and Provoke off cooldown and plenty of stamina to use them when required. <br /></div>

There's a difference to you between glancing at an action bar and glancing at a chat log?  Not much difference to me, although I guess I never have to worry about text spam knocking my cooldowns out of the log before I have a chance to see them. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Taunt/Provoke is the cheeseball method of tanking.  You wind up using the Provoked debuff as a crutch and god help you if someone should happen to peel the mob when Taunt and Provoke are on cooldown.  It is in the process of being proven the opposite...that the actual <b>threat</b> component of Taunt and Provoke is quite trivial.</div></div> <br /> <br />I'm starting to think you are literally to stupid to insult but you would probably just thank me. Provoke is a debuff ? Obviously you've never read kanican's LJ or you would know just how silly you sound. InB4 you go google it, I know this isnt xi but it would not be a stretch to assume a lot of the enmity not &quot;threat&quot; mechanics are a lot in the same based on SE's laziness thus far. Process away my friend, your not going to alter the effect of provoke/taunt on some vauge comment such as this, and if for some reason someone within 3 lvl's , which your parties should be, managed to take hate I would just cure them once and grab it right back. </div></div> <br /> <br />Actually, Provoke and Taunt DO have a debuff.  And you'll see notice of it directly in your chat log when it is applied and then a few seconds later you'll see notice in your chat log when it wears off.  The debuff is called &quot;Provoked&quot; for Provoke and I haven't really paid attention to whether or not it's called Provoked or Taunted with Taunt.  Truth be told, I've never had to use Taunt.  Provoke has always been enough.  The component of the ability that forces the mob to attack you for a period of time is from the debuff.  And when it wears off, all you've gained is a rather insignificant amount of threat from the Provoke/Taunt itself and whatever threat you've managed to build on the mob while you had its attention.  Which is also not likely to be a lot if you've blown your stamina on Provoke and Taunt instead of abilities that generate a more substantial amount of threat. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">No tank knows everything that is going to happen before it happens.

You're better off using that stamina on abilities that generate TP.  The debuff effect of Taunt and Provoke only lasts a few seconds so assuming you use those abilities back to back (you DO wait for the debuff from one to wear off before you use the next, right?  Because if not, that's a tragic waste) that's 8-10 seconds with a mob stuck to you and another 10 seconds after that where you've got NOTHING to deal with a peeled mob besides chasing it and smacking away hoping to pull it off before someone gets gibbed. <br /> <br />Hey, be the hero you think you need to be.  Nobody who knows what they're doing is going to think your way is the right way once they've seen it done right.  And don't make this personal.  I offered a fair and honest critique of your guide because I really do think it's not worth the time it took to read it, much less post it.  It's a sloppy way of doing things written by someone who has way too much of their ego tied up in people thinking it's the goods.  And it's not the goods.  It's superficial assumption and closed minded flailing at its finest.  And the more you argue to defend it, the more of your ignorance is going to shine through.  Best bet is to just leave it alone.  I think the worst thing you could have done for your credibility was to demonstrate you don't know that Provoke/Taunt has a debuff component, and if you don't know that, how could you possibly know enough to be writing a guide on tanking? <br /> <br />You can't.  You tried.  It didn't work out so well for you.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Do you really macro all that stuff out for each fight? I find that boring as well as not even close to dynamic enough for most group situations. <br /> <br />What if you get an add and you just blew your Provoke and Taunt at the beginning of a fight? Why do you use guard and then Aegis Boon right after? Why would you only use Light Stab and Guard in a fight when you have tons of other abilities and TP to spend? <br /> <br />The guide is decent, but I would highly recommend NOT macro'ing a full 10 line skill chain when tanking. A lot of this stuff simply isn't necessary and you need to be much more dynamic than this. <br /> <br />I would recommend macro'ing single skills, like Obsess, Provoke, Taunt, and stuff like that, so you can clear spaces on your bar for other things. But everything seems a little dramatic. <br /> <br />Also, I fully stand behind only needing one Provoke/Taunt on your bar. I have both, but only really have use for one. I can easily use it combined with free abilities (don't take up skill allotment points), like Heavy Stab, to pull hate on most everything. One is all you need if you use it, when you need it, and not just whenever it is off CD. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 10th 2010  3:42pm by MattVid6 </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=1385155" rel="external nofollow" title="lodestone.finalfantasyxiv.com/rc/character/status?cicuid=1385155">[img]<a href="http://sigs.enjin.com/sig-ffxiv/7865_7d8fe305bfae897b.png" title="http://sigs.enjin.com/sig-ffxiv/7865_7d8fe305bfae897b.png" rel="external nofollow">http://sigs.enjin.com/sig-ffxiv/7865_7d8fe305bfae897b.png</a>[/img]</a></div></div>

Its sad but is how the game is right now. <br />And thats my experience as 42 glad that has been grinding on mobs 10 levels higher with a 15man party and also 7-8man partys as the only tank. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 10th 2010 11:44pm by aluminio </span></i></div>

Each one forces the mob to ignore the enmity table and focus on you for the duration of the debuff.  It's not that you're building a massive enmity spike on them, it's leveraging the mechanics to ignore enmity.  And the issue is that they cost too much stamaina and leave you with too little once you've got both on cooldown and the debuff has worn off.  It might be working for people in skillup parties where the mobs are dead in 15 seconds or so anyways, but take that strategy and apply it to a fight that's intended to last longer than that (ie. some of the NM fights SE has been talking about) and the Taunt/Voke crutch tanks are going to be left in the dust because they've never learned how to tank properly. <br /></div>

Most of the tanks I've talked to dismiss things like Phalanx and Heavy Slash/Stab because they don't see them as necessary.  You have to remember that these are the people who complained during OB and early CE launch that Guard was too difficult to manage even when all they had was Light Slash/Stab, Guard, and a WS or two. <br /> <br />And it's not just tanks short changing themselves on opportunities to learn how to do things.  The last thing you ever want to do is get your dps hooked on the idea that there's a tanking style that lets them go balls out right off the top, because breaking them of that habit when doing so could cause serious problems is like pulling teeth.  It usually winds up with a tank trying to explain why they need to do things differently, followed by dps whining that, &quot;I've never had to do that before&quot; and &quot;why can't you just do it like you always do&quot; often leading to the &quot;STFU and l2tank noob&quot; line.  Not because the tank was bad, but because the dps never had to learn how to work with a tank that couldn't rely on the taunt crutch because the nature of the encounter didn't allow for it. <br /> <br />Learning how to tank isn't as easy as just learning which abilities to use and when.  It's learning how to pace those abilities and allow the execution of a standard tank &quot;rotation&quot; to be fluid and second nature so that the tank is freed up to respond to other things that may arise.  Passing up an opportunity to practice that now probably won't pay off in the long run.  I'd rather run with an LS group that gets to know how I tank and lets me practice a well-rounded style or solo than run around with a bunch of solo artists just hanging out for the SP boost.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">aluminio wrote:</div><div class="orig">so tanking mobs with high hp that last for like 1 min, with 14 players behind u spaming skills that can and do generate more emnity than the majority of our skills thus making us to maintain the mob on us via X skills in a more hard way than in a group full of ppl that knows how to play and is using ventrilo with u makes us bad tanks becouse we spam voke/taunt/heavy stab?</div></div> <br /> <br />Can you try that again, only in English this time?  I'm not deciphering that garbage. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">I have a friend that has a friend that has a cousin that says that the other class blah blah blah <br />I'm not talking about others experience, i'm talking about my experience, voke/taunt not only forces the mob to attack u for the debuff duration, but also generates emnity and thats how the game is now, theres nothing else.</div></div> <br /> <br />Nonsense.  Phalanx so far is proving to generate more enmity than Provoke or Taunt and can be used more often and for less stamina, yet Provoke/Taunt proponents <b>never</b> seem to even mention it.  It's ludicrous.  You're playing a lazy, sloppy game and it's going to bite you in the ass.  All it's going to take is for SE to make one mob that everyone wants to fight and that is immune to the debuff from Provoke and Taunt and you're suddenly going to find yourself completely unable to function.  And that's my entire point.  I don't care how you cheese your way through SP parties fighting mobs that are tuned to be fought solo at the appropriate rank.  I'm interested in people developing the skill sets that will allow them to be effective tanks in any situation without having to re-learn how to play the game. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">And ive complained about guard on beta, early on CE and will continue complaning becouse having to be forced to watch my chat for every time my shield stops guarding me its a crappy desing. 90% of our animations makes us think that our shield goes down so gorcing us to use guard again just to have a &quot;fantastic&quot; line in our chat that says our shield is still up. <br />And don't come saying thats my fault, that i should use my mind to count the seconds for how long my shield is up becouse thats crap.</div></div> <br /> <br />When you've been using Guard for a while, you just get a feel for roughly when it's going to fall off.  It's not hard.  It adds an element to tanking that lazy tanks aren't going to appreciate.  People accustomed to a  more active style of combat from other MMOs tend not to mind so much, but people used to FFXI style combat are having a hard time adjusting.   <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Same goes for Phalanx, with lots of ppl in top of us not leting see if u block, or having to watch my HP bar if it goes down then use Phalanx and having that &quot;amazing&quot;: that skill can't be used now, thats also bullsh*t thx to a bad design not making the skill blink or some other kind of visual effect in our pahalanx icon at our skill bar. <br />The rest of the skills apear gray unless u have enough TP to use them (thats an indicator of when u can use the skill) <br />All reactionaris in this game should be grayed until the moment u can use them (after a blokc, evasion, etc...)</div></div> <br /> <br />Being a good tank is about keeping an eye on everything.  I dunno what else to tell you.  If using Phalanx is too difficult for you, Gladiator tanking may not be for you. <br /></div>

And when more challenging content rolls around where the taunt/provoke crutch is less viable, it's going to be a mess of players screaming at SE that the game is broken. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">In the moment SE releases a mob thats inmune to taunt/voke or adds diminishing returns to our debuffs its when i'm gonna change my playstile but its not the case now so u can't say that ppl that uses voke/taunt/heavy stab is doing it wrong.</div></div> <br /> <br />In this context, it's not about right or wrong.  It's about whether or not a particular style of play warrants a guide being made to explain it.  And in this case, it doesn't.  Multi-line macros that do Light Slash/Stab + Guard with no mention of Phalanx?  No way.  No mention of Heavy Slash/Stab?  Pffft.  I agree...Heavy Slash is ick right now.  Way too much stamina required for something that appears to have the same accuracy constraints as any other attack, but SE says they're adjusting accuracy with the November/December patch(es), so we'll have to wait and see on that one. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">If u put 2 tanks in the same group and one uses voke/taunt and the other goes for phalanx, that second one will never hold agro. <br />Your entire point is wrong.

A tank forcing the mob to attack them with the voke/taunt crutch vs. one who doesn't get a chance to block and therefore can't use Phalanx.   <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">About using Guard and getting a feeling... u seem to not understand what i'm saying.

Guard has a set duration.  Self Preservation increases that duration.  Over time you'll get a feel for what you can do between having to reapply Guard.  Personally, I'd love to see a buff icon for Guard similar to what you get with Aegis Boon as a more effective way to double check and see if Guard is up or not, but at the end of the day you're going to have to check for <b>something</b>.  There's a reason that so many people who try out tanking in any MMO usually give up on it.  It's one of the most demanding roles in any group because you've got so much information to manage and if you mess up, the consequences can be more substantial for the entire group than a trigger happy dps or one that misses the opportunity for a little extra damage here and there. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">And about FFXI, i never played it, but i have been playing mmorpgs since 98 starting with UO and a large etc...  <br />Including WoW as a main tank completing all high end stuff on those games so don't try to put me on bag with XI tanks becouse its not right.</div></div> <br /> <br />Not sure when you stopped playing WoW, but WoW tanks actually have more to watch for than just a single buff dropping off.  I also tanked in WoW through ICC as far as it was released before I stopped playing.  That's why I don't have a lot of sympathy for tanks who say monitoring the state of Guard is &quot;too hard.&quot;  It's not. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Do you think i like spaming voke/taunt? i already said that i had to stop becouse is boring and theres no tactic or other stuff to play as a tank on this game.</div></div> <br /> <br />There absolutely is, and Skyfaller wrote up a nice little guide on how to do it.  It's a busy, active, effective style of tanking that's a lot more diverse and entertaining than simply relying on debuffs to ignore enmity tables and is a lot more likely to carry value into endgame.  You're right...SE may never make mobs with immunity to the provoke/taunt debuff, but I think it's more likely that they will.  And when they do...oh, the salty tears of underachievement will flow. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Compared to 10 skills that i must use in WoW for example to hold aggro and Taunt as an emergency to the 3 buttons smashing in this game is like... meh </div></div> <br /> <br />I don't know that it's particularly wise to compare an endgame tank in WoW to a midgame tank in FFXIV. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Now let me ask you, whats your Gladiator rank? <br /> <br /></div></div> <br /> <br />17 Gladiator/13 Sentinel.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Well if a DPS doesn't know how to play its nothing i can do about, and i really doubt no one will come to this forums and learn (the gladiators one i mean). Yet again ur basing ur ideas about voke/taunt on some mechanics that not are yet implemented and no one knows if it will be. And no one WILL need to sream about the game being broken becouse its already broken :P <br /> <br />About those multi lines macros, did i mention something about that? its some one else who said it, thats why i did my first reply in this thread, becouse everything writen here, maybe will help some one but its not how the game is right now so no one will tank in this way. <br /> <br />About Guard i'm not gonna discuss any more, its bad desing, thats all. <br /> <br />I never stoped playing wow since 2004 in betas, did all content up to arthas heroic as MT and i'm playing in cataclysm beta. <br /> <br />And why do u talk about heavy slash? we use heavy STAB, less stamina consumtion and more acc. <br /> <br />Now with ur rank, when i was 17 i was thinking like u all: Ok lets tell DPS and healers not to do anything untill the mob hits me then i block so i can use a phalanx and will never loose agro &lt;----- turbo crap. <br />First the mob will hit you, then u MIGHT block, if u don't block healers will cast a heal generating more agro than you, but lets asume you block and throw a pahalanx, OK guys u can dps, then everyone starts to do what they are suposed to do, then u loose agro, and end using a taunt then trying to repeat all the process wasting your time and others times becouse everything is based on RNG (blocks, hiting with pahlanx etc..) <br />So why do i need to use some kind of &quot;rotation&quot; that its RNG when i can just use taunt/voke/heavy stab? <br /> <br />When u reach enough rank to start grinding on mobs with big partys its when u can come here and prove me wrong but untill then don't try to discuss with ppl that has more experiencie than you thats not speaking of something that sounds nice on paper (phalanx etc..) but fails in game. <br /> <br />When i started playing FFXIV i was one of those saying: not use taunt/voke, save it for emergencies, it works like wow, use pahalanx!!! <br />But after playing and seeing how everything goes i stoped to think like this long ago. Game mechanics also forced me to not raise my shield thus resulting me on using those 3 skills (voke/taunt/heavy stab) and its when i realized that theres nothing else to use becouse the mob never leaves me, and this is our task as a tanks. <br /> <br />If some day mobs can't be taunted/voked then maybe i'll change my way of holding aggro, and maybe i'll come here to write a guide on how to do it, but untill this day, teaching ppl to use skills that are not worth it, its just wasting everyones time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 12th 2010  3:02pm by aluminio </span></i></div>

For some tanks, it's going to be the first attack they get that generates TP <b>and</b> carries an enmity bonus. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Now with ur rank, when i was 17 i was thinking like u all: Ok lets tell DPS and healers not to do anything untill the mob hits me then i block so i can use a phalanx and will never loose agro &lt;----- turbo crap. <br />First the mob will hit you, then u MIGHT block, if u don't block healers will cast a heal generating more agro than you, but lets asume you block and throw a pahalanx, OK guys u can dps, then everyone starts to do what they are suposed to do, then u loose agro, and end using a taunt then trying to repeat all the process wasting your time and others times becouse everything is based on RNG (blocks, hiting with pahlanx etc..) <br />So why do i need to use some kind of &quot;rotation&quot; that its RNG when i can just use taunt/voke/heavy stab?</div></div> <br /> <br />See, that's the issue.  Right there what you described in a nutshell is the entire issue.   <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">When u reach enough rank to start grinding on mobs with big partys its when u can come here and prove me wrong but untill then don't try to discuss with ppl that has more experiencie than you thats not speaking of something that sounds nice on paper (phalanx etc..) but fails in game.</div></div> <br /> <br />So what you're saying is that when I reach rank 20+ I can come here and talk to you about tanking differently than we did starting at rank 10?  I don't think so.  The only difference between rank 10 tanking and what so many people are doing now is that they're replacing Light Slash/Stab with Heavy Slash/Stab.  Ergo, they're not evolving a skill set and learning how to make use of what they've got...they're riding a crutch to the cap. <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Someone hinted at it earlier, but I wanted to be clear about your aegis boon macro.  You never want to trigger aegis boon immediately before or after guard.  It is redundant and a waste. <br /> <br />Aegis Boon is Guard +, when using a shield, trigger this when you can and your shield is down, if you can't trigger this, then trigger guard. <br /> <br />Also, don't macro phalanx with guard.  Phalanx is only useful when you are hit, and you blocked it.  I have found that having Phalanx in my first macro spot is probably the easiest way to use it.  And the problem is trying to not get attacks queued up, or you will most likely miss your window. <br /> <br />And yes, phalanx is a great way to hold hate, it gives you an extra attack without hurting your attack rate (short of the animation, which can get cut short anyways). <br /> <br />Also, if you crank up your str, you get the benefit of reduced dmg while guarding, and increased dmg in both phalanx and your normal attacks. <br /> <br /></div>

This is supposed to be a novice guide, not a mid-to-end game guide.  The people this is trying to help can't even purchase the skill yet due to rank restrictions.  How are you expecting &quot;heavy stab spam&quot; to be useful advice? <br /> <br />  </div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Its not about heavy stab, i just made reference to it becouse Aurelius was talking about heavy slash like we use it and we don't. <br /> <br />On my first reply i said, i like ppl being helpfull and doing guides to help new players. But all of them are missleading. <br />You don't need to use phalanx to hold aggro on you, all u need to do is use voke and taunt, if ur a low rank glad and don't have any acces to heavys u can just use lights, i tanked raptors with light stab its just that heavy stab gives more sp and more emnity nothing else. <br />You use light/heavy stab to get some TP and then use some WS. Untill 50 ppl should not be using shield unless they want to focus on shield skill ups. At 50 is another history, we are suposed to have our shield up, use phalanx if we want but its not pahalanx what is gonna make us hold aggro. <br /> <br />I'm not saying phalanx is bad or something like that but telling new players that they need to use phalanx then reching a point in the game where they are not gonna be able to use it is a bad thing. <br /> <br />Thats all about =) <br /> <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Actually I have to agree with some of the points from Aurelius and aluminio...but both are not 100% correct either... <br /> <br />First aluminio. Using Provoke AND Taunt is a total waste of Stamina...it is and it doesn't help you keep aggro instead it just forces the mob to stay on you. Heavy Stab/Slash might become an option in the future, but solely based on tanking, Phalanx and Light Slashs/Stabs(solely for the purpose of getting TP for Phalanx) is hate generator no.1. I tried several ways of tanking...Using Provoke AND Taunt, using only Provoke, using only Taunt, and then using Provoke and Phalanx, and Taunt and Phalanx...and I can assure you, the only option I NEVER lost hate in any situation is Provoke and Phalanx. It simply is the most hate generating combination of skills. Nobody forces any Tank to use them as I do...but the real big difference is...my way, which is the way many Tanks are tanking, is the one letting you keep Hate PLUS maintaining a good amount of stamina at all times! And believe me...no matter what tanking will be like in endgame, having stamina at your service WHEN you need it, is the thing that will make the difference between a Tank that dies, and a Tank that survives. <br /> <br />Second Aurelius. Provoke is a mere debuff and doesn't build much enmity? Wrong...just wrong...Provoke isn't just merely a debuff, it is a Debuff that forces the mob to stay on you during the duration of the debuff but ALSO generates a good amount of enmity. If PT members in my PT were not spamming their damn low stamina attacks like crazy, I was able to maintain hate with Provoke only...keeping Provoke on CD is the only way to go when tanking. You assume that the debuff is the only &quot;real thing&quot; that comes with Provoke, but it is not, so therefore keeping Provoke on CD is the best way to maintain hate, besides Phalanx and other stuff you do in between. This is not WoW, where you only use Taunt, when you need Aggro in that moment, or when the enemy is facing another person, it's a regular ability to use to maintain hate. <br />And SE implementing NMs or HNMs that will be immune to Provoke/Taunt? That will not happen...ever ever ever...Provoke is like THE ability that makes us able to tank, if we couldn't use it, we merely just lose Hate on the first Cure that hits us. If it's true that you are Gladiator 18/Sentinel 13, I assume you also don't know that mobs way higher than your lvl tend to ignore your Guard more often, then lower lvl mobs...you will see the Battle Log Notice &quot;Your Block fails&quot; more often, meaning you won't be able to use Phalanx...assuming SE would implement NMs or HNMs that are immune to it, imagine the situation where it just gets through your Guard on the first hit, you lose full amount of HP and you NEED to be cured instantly...CON/THM cures you, you lose hate, CON/THM dies...that's not how its gonna work...if it would, SE has to change hate generating completely for it to work. <br /> <br />PS: The only reason I see Provoke and Taunt being used by a Gladiator Tank is for PT Tank things, where you need to tank more than one enemy, as it is impossible to maintain hate on more than one enmiy at the current way hate works.</div>

Maybe.  It provides some enmity in addition to the debuff, but everything we're seeing is that the enmity isn't enough enough to keep a mob glued to you from the damage decay.  I'll open with Provoke and before I got Heavy Slash I wasn't having much difficulty holding mobs with Provoke off CD for the rest of the fight.  At worst, it was always there when I needed it to the point where I could have left Taunt off my bars altogether and still been fine. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">If PT members in my PT were not spamming their damn low stamina attacks like crazy, I was able to maintain hate with Provoke only...keeping Provoke on CD is the only way to go when tanking.

What I'm saying is that people are treating Provoke like FFXI where it provided a beefy enmity spike and was the reason it was considered necessary as a mainstay tanking ability for years.  Everything we're seeing so far is that Provoke in XIV is borrowing the name from XI, but not anywhere near the functionality. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">This is not WoW, where you only use Taunt, when you need Aggro in that moment, or when the enemy is facing another person, it's a regular ability to use to maintain hate.</div></div> <br /> <br />Again, what people need to be doing is considering what other abilities they have that would consume the same total stamina as Provoke and have the potential to generate more enmity.  Everything people are tossing around about how much Provoke/Taunt actually provide by way of enmity is 100% speculation and for everyone who says you need to keep at least one of them on CD at all times, there are others who say it's not necessary. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">And SE implementing NMs or HNMs that will be immune to Provoke/Taunt?

I would expect to see lower hit decay and a reduction in enmity generated by non-tanking classes.  And what I said is that it's entirely reasonable to assume that at some point in the future, SE <b>will</b> make NM/boss style mobs that are immune to the Provoke/Taunt <b><u>debuff</b></u>.  I didn't say the ability as a whole, but the debuff?  Absolutely.</div>

All the complaints I've been reading is that tanks are having difficulty with threat, hence the reason they've fallen back on the voke/taunt crutch. <br /> <br />And the tragedy in this whole thing is that Provoke and Taunt obviously can be used for more than pulling back a mob that has peeled off after another party member, but they're being heavily abused.  It's been that way since open beta for sure and has continued that way to this day which makes it difficult to have a reasonable conversation about their practical applications because it always boils down to, &quot;I use Provoke and Taunt back to back and have no problems.&quot;  So as long as discussion around more involved and innovative methods (referencing Skyfaller's guide as a good example) or pooh-poohed because it's just so much easier to ignore enmity altogether with voke/taunt, I push back and point out that voke/taunt tanking is weaksauce.  I don't care if it works.  It's a cheesy way to tank and all it's going to take is one nerf and all the would-be ubertanks running around right now are going to be back to square one. <br /> <br />Even in FFXI, players would glom onto something because it worked and would immediately become highly resistant to any other line of thinking.  Back shortly after NA release we convinced ourselves that grinding IT mobs (even VT was bad mojo) because if we had a solid group that could pull off up to chain #6, holy cow!  Man those were some big numbers!  And it largely ruined partying for a lot of people because it was an unrealistic standard that led to a lot of wipes, a lot of restrictions on camps, and a lot of generally frustrated players at one another's throats.  It wasn't until people started reaching the cap (75 at the time) that players got a taste of high chains on T-VT mobs and when they did the math...hey...maybe there's something to this.   It still took a long time to catch on, however. <br /> <br />Now we're in the same boat.  People are trying to figure out what works and what doesn't but they lack the patience to do it right.  They find something that works and they settle in and now &quot;what works&quot; becomes &quot;the best&quot; and nobody tries anything else.  Right now, all the rage is fighting mobs of as high a rank as your group can withstand in the largest party you can scrape together.   Who knows what the changes to SP will do to that method?  What we do know is that fighting mobs that high of a rank tends to change mechanics.  As pointed out, well above rank = more failed blocks.  It means more accuracy issues.  It means alterations to the threat mechanics.  More damage on the tank = more threat decay and more healer threat because they're having to cure more. <br /> <br />I don't fault players for being a bit ballsy and pushing the limits to see what they can do, but I don't buy into the notion that what people are doing now is the best way to do things now or into the future.  As SE &quot;tinkers&quot; with enmity and SP and all those other things, the way we play the game will change.  And tanks who have been riding a crutch and suddenly find themselves having to be a bit more attentive and a bit more responsive are in for a steep, steep learning curve.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Hey Nostradamus i mean Aurelius, i missed you, so using voke/taunt is not the best just becouse you say so? <br /> <br />Camon use all your predictions to say something that might be more correct. Let me enlight you: <br />Emnity generation has been @#%^ed up since alpha, 99% of the chances is that they will make emnity generation skills have more aggro and lower anything else thats not a tank skill related. The other 1% means that they will do what i said but they will @#%^ it up (bug) and everything will be like... well like its now. <br /> <br />Also why do you say emnity generation on provoke is minimal? why do you say emnity generation on provoke is a 100% speculation? show me numbers on a cure enmnity, show me numbers on a WS enminity, show me numbers on a Phalanx enmnity. <br />Then when u have those numbers you can come and talk about speculation. <br /> <br />I know your a new to the game, but if u still don't see that this game right now is all about RNG, basing a build on reactionries is the worst think you can do. <br /> <br />Stop writing stuff that u don't know, all you do is missleading ppl. <br /> <br />To Shezard, what u said its true, u can hold aggro with one mob just with voke and using phalanx then have a lot of stamina but right now theres no use for it. Maybe in the future when SE implements some high end we'll adapat, but for reaching 50 (thats all we can do right now) using voke/taunt is all you need. <br /> <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">The same old argument on how to tank and do it right. OP's guide works fine under &quot;certain conditions&quot;. There is nothing wrong with it if you work within those settings. Why such long responses because you guys disagree on the methodology behind it? Let's face it, the longer this game continues to evolve there will be a good chance someone somewhere can turn every class within DoW into a viable tank [giving enough enmity gears]....then we'll spent time arguing if Gladiator can be turn into a great DD...somethings don't change. Go read some old FFXI threads regarding tanking and you'll see how much that has evolved. <br /> <br />Remember, keep &quot;what is useful and discard what is not&quot; FOR YOU. Everything else is nothing but hot air... just because it works for others, it may not apply to you're style of play. </div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">All i wanted to say since my first post is that all those guides we can read on this forum are full of stuff thats completly incorrect. <br />When some one new to the game comes here and see post like tanking 101 or shield and boar guide how to tank without stamina problems, they really use it as a guide and follow what is said. <br />Then when they grow in ranks they discover that all they learned doesn't work. <br /> <br />Lets take an example, Aurelius said a couple of times that the guide from skyfaller is a good one that i should go and read/learn.  <br />And then i read: My personal recommendation for STATS for someone dedicated purely to Gladiator shield tanking is to focus on Vitality, Mind, Dex and Piety. Vitality and Dex the two highest priorities, Mind and Piety receiving = amount of points. Strength can be largely ignored as a tank is not a damage dealer...  <br /> <br />So a purely deicated Gladitor tanking using shield needs to avoid STR? when its STR what makes u block more damage? <br /> <br />Ofc game will evolve, and we'll not tank as we tank now, and for sure other classes will be good tanks (currently all class can tank now, all it makes gladiator a bit better is becouse we mitigate melee damage with our shield) but we can't try to help ppl right now without stuff we don't even know if some day will be changed/implemented.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Aur is right, and <s>MavenRedux</s> aluminio has resorted to childish name calling. <br /> <br />There are lots of ways to tank - some more effective than others. I prefer the reactive style, with spamming phalanx (+raising shield) + one other ability between mob attacks.. this leaves me with full stamina bar and voke/taunt ready for any adds or unforseen issues that arise. I start off with light slash+guard+provoke, then go into my reactive cycle.. and rarely ever have hate issues. <br />The tank spamming voke/taunt as a crutch will ultimately fail when things go sideways in a fight.. because they have no stamina and waiting on timers to do the next action. If you get an add, and not voking the original first? - you lose hate on the first.. and everything falls apart. <br /> <br />It doesn't matter what level a player is to comment on a best-method of tanking.. fighting the same crab the same way 1000 times won't help anything. Only after reading a variety of forums and talking with other players, and testing different styles will someone advance. <br /> <br />&quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results.&quot;  <br /> <br />For the first few years in FFXI we had PLD/WAR running around spamming voke every 30s. It wasn't until people showed up with NIN/DRK and PLD/NIN and showed the other tanks how inefficient they were, things started to progress. <br />I had a lot of linkshell leaders who were unable to change in FFXI, and set in their ways.. unfortunately this caps the groups ability to advance in the game. If you're a good player, you will adapt your playstyle to the most efficient style of playing, no matter the job class.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>FFXI: Rison of Alexander (retired) <br />FFXIV: Rison Srithuram of Palamecia <br />LS: Omnipresence [ <a href="http://omnipresencels.com" title="http://omnipresencels.com" rel="external nofollow">http://omnipresencels.com</a> ]</div></div>

The supply of Ninja tools wasn’t yet large enough to make this technique especially common, but it gradually became the norm. <br /> <br />Under updates made on 06/12/2003, also this came with a class that was added after first expansion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">@Aurelius: The only situation I have threat issues, is when ppl start spamming their sh*t from 1second into the fight w/o giving a sh*t if I've been on the mob first, if I voked, or w/e...and why? <br />Cause it doesn't matter who gets hit by the mob...Ranks are way too dmg negating...as GLD Rank 28 you might get hit for 400 DMG on a Hit, while a CON Rank 31 will get hit for 300, just because of the fact hes 3 Ranks higher than you, not cause he got higher Defense or w/e...this whole system is...damn sh*t...to be fair...but even if the CON is Rank 28 as well...he might get hit for 100 dmg more than you...and hes wearing cloth ?? Whats the point in that...if equipment isn't making the large chuck of the difference...its BS... <br /> <br />I only see 2 ways how &quot;PTing&quot; can be resolved...first...dmg itself must be lowered in enmity generating a lot...the only reason why MRD, PUGs or w/e are able to tank is cause they can hold hate merely with dmg alone, while they get hit for the same amount of dmg as any GLD...which is just stupid... <br /> <br />...second...equip must make a huge difference on how much you get hit for...it's just not reasonable why a GLD in Full-Plate gets hit as much for, as a PUG in Leather equip, or a CON/THM in Cloth equip...sure we do get hit for less with our equip and Guard up...but the difference between Full-Plate+Guard compared to Cloth is just dumb...sure the diference is there, but its not merely enough to make tanking itself even neccesarry... <br /> <br />I only hope SE is not too dumb to fix this sh*t in like 1 year, but in the next updates or at least early 2011...</div>

Whats the point in that...if equipment isn't making the large chuck of the difference...its BS... <br /> <br />I only see 2 ways how &quot;PTing&quot; can be resolved...first...dmg itself must be lowered in enmity generating a lot...the only reason why MRD, PUGs or w/e are able to tank is cause they can hold hate merely with dmg alone, while they get hit for the same amount of dmg as any GLD...which is just stupid... <br /> <br />...second...equip must make a huge difference on how much you get hit for...it's just not reasonable why a GLD in Full-Plate gets hit as much for, as a PUG in Leather equip, or a CON/THM in Cloth equip...sure we do get hit for less with our equip and Guard up...but the difference between Full-Plate+Guard compared to Cloth is just dumb...sure the diference is there, but its not merely enough to make tanking itself even neccesarry... <br /> <br />I only hope SE is not too dumb to fix this sh*t in like 1 year, but in the next updates or at least early 2011...</div></div> <br /> <br />That's because players are fighting mobs that are tuned to be fought solo by someone at the appropriate rank.  That's why damage scales by rank the way that it does.  That same rank 40 mob you're fighting in a party at rank 25 is something a rank 40 player will be killing solo.  The issue isn't that the basics aren't working properly for damage scaling, the issue is that there are no &quot;party only&quot; mobs currently in the game.  In most other MMOs, you have mobs that (for example) are level 20 that you can kill solo at level 20 and you'll also have mobs that are level 20 and are tuned to be fought by parties...if you try to fight them on your own at level 20, you're likely to get curbstomped. <br /> <br />And that's why I'm a proponent of learning how to tank properly.  From day one people have been talking about the voke/taunt approach to tanking and my question has always been, &quot;If you put both of those on cooldown back to back and the mob peels off when the last debuff fades, how do you get that mob back?&quot;  And the best answer anyone has come up with is, &quot;It doesn't matter...anyone can soak a few hits if they've done like they're 'supposed' to and stacked VIT.&quot; <br /> <br />Good luck with that when SE adds the NMs tuned for groups to fight.  It's not just about enmity, it's about contingencies.  Provoke/Taunt are contingency abilities.</div>

I'd like to see your stats too.</div></div> <br /> <br />Thx for my English leasson of the day, as everyone could already noticed English is not my main lenguade and i try hard day after day to learn so i can speak with everyone. <br /> <br />That being said, the person who came here with high ego saying that all he claimed was right is Aurelius, u migh have not read all the posts. BUT well for the good of comunity lets forgive about this and lets try to be positive and give good advices. <br /> <br />Lets stop talking about future updates, non existan features and all other stuff that we don't know. <br />Lets talk about how game is now and how we should tank: <br /> <br />Lets take a raptor as an example because is the mob that everyone will stay the most part of the time (assuming you reach 50). <br /> <br />Raptors got 3 attacks: <br />One is a mele normal attack that hits me with protect for 30-40% of my hp. <br />Next one is a breath cone aoe that hits me for 50% of my hp. <br />And last one is a tail swip that hits everyone who is not in front of the mob that hits for double damage as a normal attack. <br /> <br />Now i'm gonna tell u how do i tank them: <br />First of all i let some one else pull for me from range, so i can be on my tanking spot already facing the raptor so i don't get that error about not being facing it. <br />Since the raptor is already engaged my Voke gets its full effect, thats the debuff that makes it attack me for a short time plus the emnity that it generates. <br />I loose 50% of my stamina. When the debuff is gone i then use taunt. My stamina bar is back to full so after the taunt it goes back to 50%. I force the raptor to attack me again but not only i forced the raptor to attack me twice, i also generated emnity using both skills. <br /> <br />Now i have a very large window of time to do what ever i want untill my voke/taunt comes back. <br />I can do heavy STAB (less stamina consumption than SLASH and more acc) to get some TP if i want to use any WS, use any of my shield skills, or just wait. <br />All the time i'm doing that everyone in my party is in front of the raptor getting only aoe damage. <br />Attacking the raptor since the first second the puller pulled it, Healing nonstop etc... <br />And thats all for the rest of the fight. <br /> <br />Now lets take a look on what happens with reaction skills. <br />Lets asume the tank pulls with any skill thats not a voke or taunt. <br />The tank pulls, the raptor hits the tank for 30-40% of the tanks hp.  <br />Assuming the tank got the shield raised, the tank should block in order to use phalanx. <br />If it doesn't block, the tank can't use phalanx generating 0 emnity. <br />If it blocks, then the tank MUST have TP to use phalanx. <br />Lets say the tank has TP to use phalanx, the tank uses phalanx generating X emnity. <br />I didn't mentioned anything about healers yet, but i can tell you that as soon as u loose 30-40% of ur hp some one will heal. <br />But lets says that you play with a group of organiced ppl and no one heals till u give the signal. <br />Raptor now can attack with another melee attack or maybe a breath. <br />No mater what you do after the second hit, your gonna be healed otherwise you will die (if u survive 2 hits for the raptor ofc). <br />Now healers heal and the tank looses thread. <br />So what does the tank now? Provoke or Taunt to make the raptor go back to him. <br /> <br />Now if this happens, raptor probably killed some one in one hit, but lets say your party is full of ranks 40 with high VIT (incluiding healers in special). <br />Some one survives the raptor hit, taunt voked/taunted, raptor goes back to tank, but what happens? raptor is in a bad position making a tail swip killing everyone getting hitted, and in 90% of the cases everyone will die. <br /> <br />But lets continue assuming that no one dies. The party needs to reposition, this never happens in a random party, but lets say that it happens. <br />Tank now has aggro again,if the raptor strikes in mlee theres a chance that the tank will block then phalanx etc... <br />But what if the raptor breaths? the tank can't block, so no phalanx, then raptor goes again crazy and wipes the party. <br /> <br />You got my point? <br /> <br />The problem with the taunt/voke spam since day one is that ppl used to WoW started to discuss with ppl coming from XI. <br />WoW players told that voke/taunt works like WoW. WoW taunt ONLY forces the mob to face you for X time, on this time you need to generate Y amount of thread with other skills to make the mob not leave you again. <br />Thats not how voke/taunt works in this game. <br />On XIV when u use voke/taunt you force the mob attack you WHILE it gives emnity. <br />You don't need to really in anything thats RNG like blockin, phalanx, and all the other reaction skills we can use that will not ALWAYS work since you need extra factors to be able to use those skills. <br /> <br />Now we can enter in the duscussion about being having to tank more than one mob. <br />First as i stated before, at higher ranks conj get sleep, and thats one form of CC but theres also a big pletora of other CC skills on other classes since low rank. <br />But even if you can't use any CC you can tank 2 mobs at the same time or even three just cycling your voke/taunt from mob to mob. If you can survive to that is another story. <br /> <br />BTW you can search Alu Minio on the lodestone, its the only entry. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 15th 2010  1:20pm by aluminio </span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 15th 2010  1:22pm by aluminio </span></i></div>

This will have to be confirmed later.  <br /> <br />The whole purpose especially at the beginning of a fight is to get hate early and keep it, which this allows you to do as the fight progresses you really only need to use one every other 10 seconds and you will not lose hate. With higher leveled &quot;sub-job&quot; abilities this might change. SE has already said they are changing the way enmity works so all we can do is speculate. But as far as I'm concerned looking at the issue in the future based on prior enmity tables tanks can easily use time in between the 20 seconds to raise CE while they wait for their VE spells to be up. <br /> <br />As I stated before this is not the only way to tank and in certain situations things need to be changed, which abilities to use, which to eaction etc.  <br /> <br />As Raveshack said, this was simply written to help others (beginners) gamepad/not gamepad on how to macro if they prefer basic abilities along with basic sequences. This is not HOW TO TANK ENDGAME. Things will change , new things will be discovered, and people will adjust accordingly.  <br /> <br />@ Rison, I've always preferred especially in XI tanks that were proactive vs reactive being a healer, Them knowing how to gain hate and keep it and watching the log for moves to shield bash or knowing when to macro out other gear when the see a nuke coming always was more beneficial. If  It doesnt matter to me if they have stamina as long as the mob never comes off them. Now as the &quot;discussion&quot; of &quot;reactive&quot; vs &quot;proactive&quot; is concerned I believe both have their points but from a &quot;Beginners&quot; approach I believe focusing primarily on keeping the mob attacking them should be the goal, call it a crutch if you will but a crutch does help you walk. <br /> <br />Thank you for the suggestions an criticism, I have updated some things that were stated in error before.  <br /> <br />  <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 15th 2010  1:20pm by aluminio </span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 15th 2010  1:22pm by aluminio </span></i>[/quote] <br /><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><u><b>Linkshell :</b></u><a href="http://www.Fidens-ls.com" rel="external nofollow" title="http://www.Fidens-ls.com">www.Fidens-ls.com</a> <br />[img]<a href="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg" title="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg</a>[/img]</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">been following this thread and i'd have to agree more with aluminio lol. i'm glad 48 exping on raptors his last post is pretty accurate. my group roams the area and i just open the fight with provoke/taunt right off the bat never even bother to care about stamina consumption it's there to be used anyways. other than that heavy stab and DD abilities while keeping taunt/provoke on the mob is much more valuable and useful than silly phalanx.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Very entertaining thread.  I'll do short and simple.  Long threads are long. <br /> <br />lawl at people complaining about guard, phalanx, and having to read the chat log.  You guys need to adjust, it's easy, I don't want SE to dumb it down for people. <br /> <br />Using a 10 line attack macro is fine, if you are by yourself killing trash.  (not tanking... lol) <br /> <br />@ maven-keyboards are faster than gamepads or using the mouse when using the hot bars and alt/ctrl macros</div>
