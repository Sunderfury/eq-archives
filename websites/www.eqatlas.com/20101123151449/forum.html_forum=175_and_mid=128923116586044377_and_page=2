      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">aluminio wrote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />First of all i let some one else pull for me from range, so i can be on my tanking spot already facing the raptor so i don't get that error about not being facing it. <br />Since the raptor is already engaged my Voke gets its full effect, thats the debuff that makes it attack me for a short time plus the emnity that it generates. <br />I loose 50% of my stamina. When the debuff is gone i then use taunt. My stamina bar is back to full so after the taunt it goes back to 50%. I force the raptor to attack me again but not only i forced the raptor to attack me twice, i also generated emnity using both skills.</div></div> <br /> <br />What I don't think you're understanding is that savvy players are questioning just how much enmity Provoke and Taunt are leaving you with.  There are a lot of players who would look at a situation like what you describe and say that just because it's working for you in <i>that</i> situation doesn't mean it's going to work in every future situation.  And there are also a lot of players that prefer to develop a playstyle that is more rounded and versatile than simply focusing on two abilities and filling in the gaps with a third. <br /> <br />So let's say, simply for the sake of example, that enmity was a straightforward numerical value and, since it won't influence the discussion, let's leave decay out of it for the time being. <br /> <br />As example, let's assume that Provoke and Taunt each generate 100 enmity and cost 40% of your stamina bar.  (If your first response to that is, &quot;We don't know how much enmity it generates&quot; then you've missed the point of the example.)  We'll use that 100 enmity for two possible scenarios. <br /> <br />Scenario 1:  Let's assume Heavy Stab generates a static 20 enmity every time it lands and uses 15% of your total stamina.  In this scenario  Provoke for 100 enmity and 40% stamina is the superior choice over using Heavy Stab 3 times for 60 enmity (assuming all three hit) and 45% of your stamina. <br /> <br />Scenario 2:  Let's assume Heavy Stab generates a static 50 enmity every time it lands and uses the same 15% of your total stamina.  In this scenario, it's not directly clear which option is superior.  On one hand, Provoke currently lands 100% of the time, guaranteeing that 100 enmity for 40% of your stamina.  On the other hand, if all three Heavy Stabs land, you're looking at 150 enmity for 45% stamina in addition to the TP generated, plus 3 chances to gain SP, AND you still have Provoke off cooldown in the event of an emergency.  The TP earned can be put towards weapon skills that generate even more enmity. <br /> <br />That's the issue.  That's what a lot of us are wanting to figure out.  That's why a lot of us don't really care what's going on in SP parties fighting their over-ranked mobs with Gladiators fancying themselves experts because of their rank.  I can tell you from first hand experience that rank/level in any MMO is a function of time, not skill.  It's a function of persistence, not understanding. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Now lets take a look on what happens with reaction skills. <br />Lets asume the tank pulls with any skill thats not a voke or taunt. <br />The tank pulls, the raptor hits the tank for 30-40% of the tanks hp.  <br />Assuming the tank got the shield raised, the tank should block in order to use phalanx. <br />If it doesn't block, the tank can't use phalanx generating 0 emnity. <br />If it blocks, then the tank MUST have TP to use phalanx. <br />Lets say the tank has TP to use phalanx, the tank uses phalanx generating X emnity.</div></div> <br /> <br />If the tank hasn't at least tried to use Heavy Stab by now, replace them.  They shouldn't be waiting around for the thumping.  It's not uncommon for me to land two attacks on any given mob before it has even hit me once.  That means the tank isn't waiting around for a chance to use Phalanx in order to build enmity.  They're building enmity proactively in the process of fighting the mob.  And if they're going for a reactive style build, they've got oodles of TP for reactive weapon skills that will become available for extremely low stamina and relatively little TP after a block, parry, or evade. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">I didn't mentioned anything about healers yet, but i can tell you that as soon as u loose 30-40% of ur hp some one will heal.</div></div> <br /> <br />Yes, if the mob breaks through your Guard (failed block), I would hope your healer has been paying attention and is queuing up a heal for you.  If you're getting thumped that hard off the pull, I would suggest that maybe Aegis Boon would be a better ability to start the fight with than Guard, simply because if your block <b>is</b> successful, you'll take no damage at all. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">But lets says that you play with a group of organiced ppl and no one heals till u give the signal. <br />Raptor now can attack with another melee attack or maybe a breath. <br />No mater what you do after the second hit, your gonna be healed otherwise you will die (if u survive 2 hits for the raptor ofc). <br />Now healers heal and the tank looses thread. <br />So what does the tank now? Provoke or Taunt to make the raptor go back to him. <br /> <br />Now if this happens, raptor probably killed some one in one hit, but lets say your party is full of ranks 40 with high VIT (incluiding healers in special). <br />Some one survives the raptor hit, taunt voked/taunted, raptor goes back to tank, but what happens? raptor is in a bad position making a tail swip killing everyone getting hitted, and in 90% of the cases everyone will die.</div></div> <br /> <br />Players of all group roles in XIV would do well to start learning immediately that a highly mobile style of play will be a tremendous asset to them.  If the mob changes position/orientation and your dps/healer(s) need to move, then they need to move.  That's all there is to it, regardless of what caused the mob to change position.   <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">But lets continue assuming that no one dies. The party needs to reposition, this never happens in a random party, but lets say that it happens. <br />Tank now has aggro again,if the raptor strikes in mlee theres a chance that the tank will block then phalanx etc... <br />But what if the raptor breaths? the tank can't block, so no phalanx, then raptor goes again crazy and wipes the party.</div></div> <br /> <br />Again, my question would be, &quot;Why is the tank waiting for a block to use Phalanx instead of using Heavy Stab?&quot;  Nobody here has ever suggested that the reactive style of play involves sitting on your hands waiting for a block.  Ever.  What I've said is that too many people are trying to pass off the voke/taunt crutch (which, based on your own admission, may involve 10 seconds out of every 20 seconds doing nothing but wait) never seem to mention Phalanx.  Provoke and Taunt are not the only abilities we get that have a bonus enmity component to them. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">The problem with the taunt/voke spam since day one is that ppl used to WoW started to discuss with ppl coming from XI. <br />WoW players told that voke/taunt works like WoW. WoW taunt ONLY forces the mob to face you for X time, on this time you need to generate Y amount of thread with other skills to make the mob not leave you again. <br />Thats not how voke/taunt works in this game.</div></div> <br /> <br />I don't know about anyone else, but that's not what I've said.  I've pointed out that the function of Provoke/Taunt more closely resembles that of other MMOs, not the specific mechanics.  Function as in, &quot;When do I use this,&quot; not &quot;What does this do?&quot;  And WoW taunts don't force the mob to face you for &quot;X time&quot;.  They immediately push you to the top of the threat table with a small margin to buy you a bit of time to resume building threat.   <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">On XIV when u use voke/taunt you force the mob attack you WHILE it gives emnity. <br />You don't need to really in anything thats RNG like blockin, phalanx, and all the other reaction skills we can use that will not ALWAYS work since you need extra factors to be able to use those skills.</div></div> <br /> <br />If you have stamina and you have TP and you're not making use of your reactive abilities (minimum Phalanx unless you've picked up Fracture and/or Jarring Strike), you're a bad tank.  That's all there is to it.  Fracture and Jarring Strike both carry an indirect mitigation component to them which, while not directly building threat, can potentially reduce enmity decay.  For very little or no stamina and a trivial amount of TP, there's no reason to not be using reactive weapon skills and while I'm not the kind of guy who would demand every tank I group with have Fracture and Jarring Strike, I wouldn't hesitate to remove a tank from a group who refused to use Phalanx.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">woo hoo, actual descriptions of what you're talking about. (golf clap) Please don't read this as a 'dickish' or sarcastic post, as it is not meant to be. I've read this through, and it can be 'read' as both ways. :) <br /> <br />Thanks for actually contributing, rather than vauge ego buffing and name calling. However, you left out all those abilities from level 22-40+ you keep talking about. Wouldn't access to more diverse abilities make it easier to hold hate? You didn't specifically say what abilites you do when you 'pull' (in what order). Shield up before mob gets to you (ie: delay with first provoke) or Provoke than Shield.. than wait around. <br />And how do you actually pull a mob, when they randomly go back to where they came from? <br /> <br />I briefly skimmed other posts, and i'm not saying -not- to use provoke.. i'm saying I don't constantly cycle it with Taunt.  <br /> <br />Typically, I: light(heavy) slash(stab) &gt; provoke &gt; shield &gt; [wait] phalanx &gt; ability &gt; shield &gt; [wait] phalanx &gt; ability 1 &gt; ability 2 (if time) &gt; shield (etc) - not having to throw in provoke frees up a lot of stamina, but i'm always over half.. and can throw in a voke if needed, rather than constantly. <br />Randomly throwing in provoke as one of the abilities when you have 3/4-&gt; full stamina? - there's no harm.. but Taunt is always avail, and able to use. <br /> <br />I don't see why you can't use that style, even if the mob hits you for 50% of your health on a conical aoe.. it has nothing to do with damage inflicted on you, it's about keeping hate, you deal with getting hit with your job abilities + mages to mitigate damage. I've tanked salamanders and crabs that have smacked me around for 1/3 of my HP with shield up.. and we got through it (although, that's not how the game should be played for SP parties - totally different conversation) <br /> <br />As for being rank 22 - grinding is boring. It always was with FFXI also, but at least we had a reason to grind (end game gears, merits) so i've only gone out to play around with tanking / testing different stuff.. when more content comes out, and a reason to get to 50 cap, i'll devote my time to that, rather than crafting and leves. <br /> <br />Anywho, game on.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>FFXI: Rison of Alexander (retired) <br />FFXIV: Rison Srithuram of Palamecia <br />LS: Omnipresence [ <a href="http://omnipresencels.com" title="http://omnipresencels.com" rel="external nofollow">http://omnipresencels.com</a> ]</div></div>

In my idea the best for now is to Provoke, wait some, then Taunt, and well in between use your normal attack and Phalanx, but for now i mostly use Provoke once, use phalanx a lot and use Taunt if I lost hate, but most of the time Provoke is up again when that happen...</div></div> <br /> <br /> <br />provoke/taunt keeps the mob from coming off if you the first round, while building TP for phalanx, any AOE or cure/enfeeble move will pull hate off you, I've seen it happen 100 times <br /> <br />and @ whomever when you have 20+ abilities its much easier &quot;for me&quot; to use a gamepad and hit down right over twice versus looking down at your keyboard and using say CTL+F7 imho, but this is something of opinion, there's a lot less room for error using a gamepad, but this is a completely different discussion. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 16th 2010 11:10am by MavenRedux </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><u><b>Linkshell :</b></u><a href="http://www.Fidens-ls.com" rel="external nofollow" title="http://www.Fidens-ls.com">www.Fidens-ls.com</a> <br />[img]<a href="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg" title="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/1197/sigiz.jpg</a>[/img]</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Yeah its sure that you need to Voke &quot;or&quot; taunt at the start before behing able to phalanx and all, but what i mean is that doing the 2 ability in a row doesnt change the fact that your the first in his Hate list. When I use Provoke alone I got the same effect that doing Both.  <br /> <br />For what i saw and read, Provoke and Taunt give a little Enmity, but it's mostly use to put the mob to focus on you for some time. If exemple Provoke made the mob focus on you for 10 seconde, and Taunt made the mob focus on you for 10 sec to, when you use the 2 in a row the mob wont focus on you for 20 sec but only for 10 sec. So if after the 10 sec you didnt build enough hate you lost the chance to put an other 10 sec of hate with Provoke or Taunt since they both were use and have to cooldown. <br /> <br />About the gamepad, i dont know since I'm using keyboard and its mostly the macro that use the CTRL and ALT + number, the Action bar only use the number 1 to 0 so easy to use ^^<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/965232.png" height="144" width="482" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">One thing I've noticed is that the enmity on abilities like Phalanx and Heavy Stab seems heavily dependent on the amount of damage you deal with them. <br /> <br />I partied with another gladiator that used provoke + taunt on efts in treespeak and I managed to pull hate multiple times by doing nothing but heavy stab.  Once I had hate, it was easy to keep it using heavy stab and phalanx as long as the other gladiator didn't voke again.   <br /> <br />In this party, our group was somewhat overleveled and I was doing pretty decent damage with good accuracy.  Similar things happen in duos or low-man parties against mobs with low defense. <br /> <br />However, I have never managed to pull hate off a tank that used provoke + taunt when fighting anything that was over ranked or had very high defense without using provoke/taunt myself. <br /> <br />I would guess that phalanx and heavy stab have enmity multipliers using damage as a base instead of adding set amounts of enmity.  Phalanx would also have a higher multiplier than heavy stab. <br /> <br />Going back to raptors - There is no way around using provoke + taunt to effectively tank them.   <br /> <br />You need to be cured after taking 2 hits.  There's no time to let a tank try to block (which mitigates almost no damage) and land phalanx in the time it takes to get hit twice.  Landing phalanx won't even hold hate if you do it on the first hit and get cured after the second.  You can risk trying to get by with just provoke (assuming phalanx hits) but half the time a healer will pull hate after the first breath attack anyway.   <br /> <br />It's not worth having the mob turn away from you even for 1 second because tail swipe is bad - like nidhogg spike flail level bad.  Suck it up and spam voke/taunt for the sake of the party. <br /> <br />Now, you do not need to see the debuff icon of provoke/taunt constantly on the raptor to hold hate.  Voke and taunt seem to have some form of CE.  Assuming your party kills at a decent rate, after the initial round of voke + taunt I usually only need 1-2 more vokes or taunts at ~50-25% mob life to keep hate.  This gives you plenty of stamina to block + phalanx or spam heavy stab. <br /> <br />Also, Sentinel (r36) is great for damage mitigation (around 60-70% less on both physical and magical dmg) and it's on a 1 min recast.  It supposedly slows enmity loss too so I tend to use it often, but I have no idea how effective it is in terms of keeping hate.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I'm with Aurelius on this one. <br /> <br />As a keyboard-using GLA I can tell you right now that I will never, ever, EVER trust a macro in battle. I've got the rhythm of guarding down, and I find that mobs are good at timing their attacks between your shield-falls so you need to be that much better. <br /> <br />Provoke and taunt are for pulling monsters off your allies and landing another Phalanx. For 250tp and almost zero stamina it is the cheapest special attack a Gladiator has, and you can do it between 1 - 4 times per guard depending on the monsters attack rate, your shield type, mark abilities, timing, and tp generation.  <br /> <br />Okon, no offense, but you don't sound like a rank 48 gladiator. Phalanx is only silly if you think low cost opportunities for more skill points are silly. <br /> <br />Mahou is right, using voke AND taunt together is a waste of Stamina. Best way to open a fight i've found is an accurate attack, guard, then phalanx. If your teammates wait to jump in until after you've phalanxed once, you may not have to voke at all. (I have a high phys. level though, so that may not apply to everyone) <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 17th 2010  2:18pm by RygelSol </span></i></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">MavenRedux wrote:</div><div class="orig"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Mahouneko wrote:</div><div class="orig">Yeah its sure that you need to Voke &quot;or&quot; taunt at the start before behing able to phalanx and all, but what i mean is that doing the 2 ability in a row doesnt change the fact that your the first in his Hate list. When I use Provoke alone I got the same effect that doing Both.  <br /> <br />For what i saw and read, Provoke and Taunt give a little Enmity, but it's mostly use to put the mob to focus on you for some time. If exemple Provoke made the mob focus on you for 10 seconde, and Taunt made the mob focus on you for 10 sec to, when you use the 2 in a row the mob wont focus on you for 20 sec but only for 10 sec. So if after the 10 sec you didnt build enough hate you lost the chance to put an other 10 sec of hate with Provoke or Taunt since they both were use and have to cooldown. <br /> <br />About the gamepad, i dont know since I'm using keyboard and its mostly the macro that use the CTRL and ALT + number, the Action bar only use the number 1 to 0 so easy to use ^^</div></div> <br /> <br />this is wrong, then no one is doing any actions at the beginning of a fight, it should do this (voke) but it doenst go voke a mob then have a mage cast slow and youll see what i'm talking about</div></div> <br /> <br />I have no idea what you just tried to say there, but the person you're responding to raised a very valid point. <br /> <br />Your Provoke and Taunt macro has a 2 second wait in between actions.  The debuff from Provoke and Taunt lasts for 4-5 seconds each.  Stamina recharges at a rate of approximately 10% per second.  Provoke and Taunt each use about 40% of your stamina.  For a stamina cost that high, you want to be getting every last bit of performance out of that ability as you possibly can.  Not only are you likely clipping a debuff (and thus wasting part of it) you're not letting your stamina recharge from one ability to the next.   <br /> <br />If a person was hell bent on using that kind of macro, I'd say at least up the wait in between abilities to 4 seconds.  You'll likely finish the macro with more stamina at your disposal and you won't be wasting part of the debuff from the first action. <br /> <br />I still say combining multiple actions into a single macro is a questionable way to play, but if you're going to do it, at least do it right.</div>
