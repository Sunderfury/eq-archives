      <div class="msgContentFrame">So I leveled a <a href="HTTP://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Boulderfist&amp;cn=Lehua" rel="external nofollow" title="www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Boulderfist&amp;cn=Lehua">horde DK tank</a> recently as something to do as the xpac winds down. <br /> <br />I hit 80 earlier today so of course hit heroics. I had been farming regular instances with LFD and had around low 20k HP ~30% avoidance and over 540 defense the second I hit 80, this is with out any BoE gear or any help from my other toons as he is on a different server. Since my stats are more than enough for heroics I felt this would be fine. <br /> <br />Mostly it was, only had one group get angry and boot me from H HoS, this was after I somehow managed to OT Ignis for the weekly thus making it funnier. The rest either said nothing or laughed and said something to the effect of you have to start somewhere. <br /> <br />My post is about the angry folks or the have to start somewhere people. I had all but 1 or 2 pieces from Occy and CoS but otherwise the cream of the regular instance crop of gear. People would have been excited to have me tank when the xpac dropped. I have a geared tank on my main server that could do three heroics in the time it this guy to do one. Both get the job done, just one has more gear and a spammable AoE attack. <br /> <br />Do tanks these days have to do ToC and the ICC 5 mans to gear up for heroics these days? They shouldn't as those places drop better gear than heroics. Gearing up in instances that drop better gear than heroics to do heroics is a retarded concept. Yet is that now the case? <br /> <br />I mean when I do randoms on my healer, also geared, I don't care what the tank has for gear. I could heal a mage through most heroics if they wanted to tank and most of the healers I have encountered are similarly geared.  <br /> <br />So heals aren't the issue. As they are either geared so it is irrelevant or don't mind as I can't really chain pull or anything so they don't have issues.  <br /> <br />The issue seems to be DPS as the healers have never complained. They seem to have been spoiled by Wrath, well the last half of Wrath as it was a whole different ball game the first year or so. DPS are too often very impatient, cocky and arrogant, whether outright or in a backhanded sort of way. <br /> <br />The thing that worries me is when the pre-Cata changes hit what will happen? Tanks wont be AoE machines even with gear as tank AoE is getting nerfed, TO THE GROUND BABY, yet most DPS wont slow down or CC. Healers will not be in infinite mana mode. Maybe tanks and heals wont be as affected at level 80 but I'm sure there will be a noticeable shift in how heroics are run, raids as well. <br /> <br />As the new class changes are upon us what do you folks think will end up being different in that magical, awkward and bizarre time that is the post Wrath pre Cata period of time? <br /> <br />/ramble <div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><span class="sm">Cataclysm will destroy your class and make it be terrible.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">When you get down to it, most DPS are lazy tards who don't want to put a single moments thought or effort into the game. They don't want to wait till you have threat, they don't want to wait for healer mana, they don't want to CC, they just want to AOE and wank off to DPS meters. Healers and tanks understand each other, they have a bond. They know that a good run is much more than speed or winning at recount. A good run is about elegant pulls, efficient healing and the pleasure you can get from doing something right. Most DPS don't see this, they just want there frosties as fast as possible. F**ck them, f**k them up their stupid arses. Give me hybrid DPS anyday, they tend to understand.</div>

(Spoken from the perspective of a DPS.) <br /> <br />They don't want to wait till you have threat: A good tank that knows what they're doing will have enough threat from one move to get a sufficient head start even on the most earnest and fast-hitting DPS.  Piss-poor tanks like Paladins who only drop consecration (which takes a tick or two to get threat) instead of swinging will not maintain aggro.  That's the tank's fault, not the DPS. (Spoken from the perspective of a tank.) <br /> <br />Tanks and Healers have a bond: Then why do so many tanks not listen to the healer?  (Spoken from the healer's POV.) <br /> <br /> <br />There are many bad qualities for many different types of characters.  They all have their high points and low points.  When you get a group together that encompasses all the high points, it's a beautiful thing.  One bad apple will ruin it...and it's NOT always gonna be the DPS.</div>

Healers and tanks understand each other, they have a bond. They know that a good run is much more than speed or winning at recount. A good run is about elegant pulls, efficient healing and the pleasure you can get from doing something right. Most DPS don't see this, they just want there frosties as fast as possible.

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Horsemouth wrote:</div><div class="orig">As the new class changes are upon us what do you folks think will end up being different in that magical, awkward and bizarre time that is the post Wrath pre Cata period of time? </div></div> <br /> <br /><span class="sm"><i>That's great, it starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes, an aeroplane - someproteinguy is not afraid.</i></span> <br /> <br />I'm kind of glad they're giving us two months to sort things out. I think some people will need it. Not that we're all terrible or anything, I think there are just a lot of bad habits that people have gotten into these last few months that will take some unlearning. <br /> <br />Example: <br /> <br />I was DPSing the other day in Nexus on my Warlock. As a bit of background, I've missed out on DPSing all of Wrath pretty much, as I've been tanking/healing. This was my first 5-man instance on the warlock, and the last time I DPSed with any consistency was way way back in BC with my hunter. Anyway I'm in Nexus with a friend who has spent Wrath on his hunter (he's on a druid alt), and a warrior tank who, is just starting to learn the ropes. <br /> <br />Anyway we're working though the instance, and he's pulling aggro left and right. Mostly by hitting AoE too soon, <span class="sm"><i>Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn, world serves its own needs, dummy serve your own needs.</i></span> and peeling mobs off the tank, not being careful with his positioning and what not. Now I know the guy is a good player and all, he's our top DPS in raids, and is generally pretty far up there on the competence scale. It's just this tank doesn't have the snap aggro that a more experienced/geared tank would have, <span class="sm"><i>Look at that low playing! Fine, then.</i></span> and I don't think he was used to it. <br /> <br />Now a new tank is fine, and I'm not going to go hard on someone learning the ropes. So I scaled back my own crazy AoEness, but my friend kept right on going. By the end of the dungeon, I think he had died 4-5 times, and the healer was getting pretty upset with him. <span class="sm"><i>Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I decline.</i></span> Pulling aggro that much, doesn't make you popular. In this time I had managed to pull aggro once, and dropped quickly with soulshatter. So what did my friend get out of it? Well his DPS was about 300 points higher (1500 vs 1200 in normal nexus in the low 70s), and probably would have been even higher if he didn't spend half the instance splatted on the floor. <br /> <br />Now this is probably partly poor playing on my part at the moment. I'm still not really used to AoE, and I still get nervous when I have to launch it. <span class="sm"><i>Uh-oh, this means no fear cavalier. Renegade steer clear!</i></span> Honestly I'm used to the hunter, and having a 5min CD on volley still... <img border="0" src="http://common.zam.com/shared/smilies/lol.gif" alt="Smiley: lol"/> I'm starting to think this will work to my benefit though, and there will be a little less unlearning to do here shortly.  <br /> <br />As for my friend? I'm sure he'll be fine. Bad habits do take time to break, but he'll get over it. People will play to the level of challenge they are presented with. Better players that have been slacking will rise to the occasion and such. <span class="sm"><i>and I feel fine.</i></span> There will be a couple of weeks of crazy I'm sure, there's a lot changing. But people will figure it out in the end. <br /> <br />Anyway I'm going to stop now. I'm rambling and apparently have a song stuck in my head... <img border="0" src="http://common.zam.com/shared/smilies/rolleyes.gif" alt="Smiley: rolleyes"/><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>NO.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">My philosophy is to play to the level of the group. It's a team, even if it's a random pug. Personal performance (i.e. topping the meter) means nothing. Team success = win. <br /> <br />As DPS my job is to <b>do as much damage as threat allows</b> and help the team kill the bosses. That's it. Easiest job in the game. <br /> <br />As a tank my job is keep the healer alive. DPS dying to fire or threat are on their own. It's not like tanks have a button that's ZOMG THREAT BEAST that we're not using &quot;just in case&quot;. Tanks have a set of standard abilities that produce a relatively steady stream of threat. Aside from taunts, a competent tank will output a basic mean-average of threat per second. Hitting buttons harder don't give additional threat, sadly. <br /> <br />Players, even very progressed ones, need to remember that they are playing a co-operative game.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Having two DPS(rogue/mage), and a tank/healer(prot/holy pally) that all do ICC, I'll tell you this: <br /> <br />Most DPS are lazy.as.hell. <br /> <br />Keep in mind, my main is a rogue, the tank is my alt. Also, there might be reasons your tank is slow. Unlike you, the tank has to control the rate of flow through the heroic for the ENTIRE group. He has to tank, pull, watch healers mana, watch for DPS to pull aggro or break CC. If the healer is low, he stops etc. Or he may actually be new to 80 and/or tanking. I had to learn to tank 5 mans all by myself when I first hit 80, and being undergeared, I just told people I was learning and to please bear with me. 99% of groups were fine with it, tanks are held in higher esteem than other roles from what I've noticed. Again, this is from playing DPS and Tanking all the way from regular 5 mans through ICC. Most players don't understand tanking, and to be honest, it scares them, it scared the hell out of me for oh I dunno, about 8 years now? <br /> <br />I love my tank, to be honest, I like playing him more than my DPS classes, but no matter how much fun I'm having, it's still stressful. <br /> <br /> <br />I am not worried about group dynamics in cata, we adjusted from vanilla to TBC, and then TBC into wrath. Now, you may argue about idiot players all day, but the end result is, I can safely pug every heroic in wrath and be successful, so this mens we adjusted. <br /> <br />We will again as a playerbase as soon as Cata comes around. The good players will learn, the bads will still be bad and shunned.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Oderint dum metuant <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Mistress Darqflame wrote:</div><div class="orig">Filter is a zamgod!</div></div> <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">This constant slagging off of DPS is a bit wearing, I have to say.  <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">As DPS my job is to do as much damage as threat allows and help the team kill the bosses. That's it. Easiest job in the game.</div></div> <br /> <br />You're generally supposed to CC and interrupt, too. On a tank and spank mob, all roles are incredibly easy; any rotation is only difficult if it has to be modified, as challenge comes from reacting to change rather than repeating a simple sequence. CC (less so) and interrupts are always reactive.  <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">As a tank my job is keep the healer alive. DPS dying to fire or threat are on their own. It's not like tanks have a button that's ZOMG THREAT BEAST that we're not using &quot;just in case&quot;. Tanks have a set of standard abilities that produce a relatively steady stream of threat. Aside from taunts, a competent tank will output a basic mean-average of threat per second. Hitting buttons harder don't give additional threat, sadly.</div></div> <br /> <br />Uh, yeah, but there are plenty of ways to stop people dying when they over aggro - any of many taunts, charge, BoP, feral charge, HoS, bash, shockwave, intervene chains etc etc, and you can certainly use them to do so. If all you're doing is running up to a group and completing a threat rotation then I struggle to see how that's harder than running up and dropping a DPS rotation. And hey, if the dps is doing anythign else (and they should be!) that sort of makes your job even easier than theirs, doesn't it? <br /> <br />Is it your job to save them, though? Well, who knows. Is it my job to resheep my focus when some idiot hits bladeflurry standing right by it? Is it my job to nova the mobs that came for the priest 'cause the tank couldn't hold multi-target aggro? Your whole &quot;not my job&quot; spiel seems rather in conflict with the whole teamwork thing you're going for. Sure, if you don't think you can help a DPS without everyone else dying - and the mob will come back to you after, rather than snacking on the second dps and wiping you anyway - sure, you have to let him die. Otherwise? Ask them to be more careful, to play better, and try and keep the group alive and with as few repairs as possible. If it's really that big a problem then kick them and get someone else. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">99% of groups were fine with it, tanks are held in higher esteem than other roles from what I've noticed. Again, this is from playing DPS and Tanking all the way from regular 5 mans through ICC. Most players don't understand tanking, and to be honest, it scares them, it scared the hell out of me for oh I dunno, about 8 years now?</div></div>  <br /> <br />Having tried both (mage, rogue, prot/ret paladin, feral druid) I don't really think tanking is harder than DPSing, and if people hold it in awe (I suspect they just don't want to piss tanks off as they're rarer) it's probably out of ignorance. I dunno, I think you're projecting, but it's perfectly possible that it's me that's incorrect in assuming most people feel the way I do about it; I've never felt intimidated by tanking. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">I love my tank, to be honest, I like playing him more than my DPS classes, but no matter how much fun I'm having, it's still stressful.</div></div>  <br /> <br />I can understand this, at least. There are generally three DPS in a group, and so certain failures (interrupting, CC, not enough boss dps) can be more easily compensated for by better play by others, especially if you slightly out-gear the instance, though the first two may well wipe the group a few times before you get put in the kiddy-pool. As the MT in a raid, while your job isn't, generally speaking much harder, your mistakes are likely the costliest for the raid. <br /> <br />All these &quot;generally&quot;s are there because obviously certain encounters are tougher for certain roles/classes.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>How to play the Cameron drinking game: every time David Cameron is elected Prime Minister you drink for five years. <br /> <br />Koalotter buoyed by Kirby.</div></div>

At least if you've played a melee class, you should know how to position mobs, and once you have your abilities set, it shouldn't be that hard to tank.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><span class="sm"><a href="HTTP://dictionary.reference.com/browse/theophany" rel="external nofollow" title="dictionary.reference.com/browse/theophany"><b>The·oph·a·ny</b></a> <i>(thē-ŏf'ə-nē)</i> <br />An appearance of a god to a human; a divine manifestation. <br /> <br /><a href="HTTP://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Draka&amp;cn=Korz" rel="external nofollow" title="www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Draka&amp;cn=Korz">Rogue</a> | <a href="HTTP://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?cn=K%C3%B5rz&amp;r=Draka" rel="external nofollow" title="www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?cn=Kõrz&amp;r=Draka">Shaman</a> | <a href="/forum.html?forum=214&amp;mid=1284152030146222020" rel="external" title="wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=214&amp;mid=1284152030146222020">PvP 101</a></span></div></div>

You would've done terrible damage at that level even with a proper spec, too, because of all he misses. A case of level and gear rather than difficulty, though. I'm not saying it's not more of a pain to gear up as a tank at max level, either.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>How to play the Cameron drinking game: every time David Cameron is elected Prime Minister you drink for five years. <br /> <br />Koalotter buoyed by Kirby.</div></div>

And I certainly don't see this conversation as being &quot;me vs. you.&quot; So, dunno about that. <br /> <br />I see what you mean and I largely agree. I was commenting in broad strokes and guess I should know better than that. <br /> <br />But I will say that, no, I don't really care when DPS repeatedly pulls threat. I'll taunt etc and try to keep everyone alive but if they make a habit of it... well... <br /> <br />When I'm DPS I do my absolute best to pump out the numbers right up to the threat ceiling while keeping up buffs, interrupting, helping wrangle loose mobs on the healer, etc. I earned my progression raid spot purely on my habit of stun-locking mobs that got loose and started after the heals.  <br /> <br />My point is that it's not hard to produce great DPS under the tanks threat while doing all these other things as well. I honestly don't understand DPS players who cannot perform like that just because they expect another player to &quot;do better.&quot; They'll bitch and moan about low threat but not do anything to adjust to the situation because they expect to not have to. It's as if some meter is more important that being part of the team. If doing 500 more DPS means stressing out the tank, that is a failure of teamwork IMO. <br /> <br />I feel that my point stands: Play to the needs of the group, even if it means slowing down, or GTFO. <br /> <br />And that's not directed to anyone in particular.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I have a bunch of toons (almost embarrassed to admit how many 80's). I've done plenty of dpsing, healing, and tanking. Imho, that's the order of difficulty. <br /> <br />Dps is pretty easy. It's harder to do it well, but it's still not that hard. <br /> <br />Healing is usually pretty easy, but it can be tricky sometimes. If the tank is undergeared or you are barely high enough level and tend to run out of mana, or if there is some terrible situation with an unexpected pat or something, well, it can get hairy.

I've done plenty of dpsing, healing, and tanking. Imho, that's the order of difficulty. <br /> <br />Dps is pretty easy. It's harder to do it well, but it's still not that hard. <br /> <br />Healing is usually pretty easy, but it can be tricky sometimes. If the tank is undergeared or you are barely high enough level and tend to run out of mana, or if there is some terrible situation with an unexpected pat or something, well, it can get hairy. Most of the time it's not bad, though.

Or at least the &quot;least involved&quot; of the 3. I don't need to worry about rotations or watch meters or even know where I'm at or who we're fighting. I watch my x-perl frames and heal whomever is lit up red and cleanse whomever is lit up blue. As an example, with my new guild (who actually raid, yay!) I have now healed the first 5 or 6 bosses of ICC twice. I have no idea what bosses they were or which way we went. I know who was tanking, whom to beacon, and that nobody died. I never SEE any of the actual fights and rarely have any clue what actually went on. <br /> <br />I also find tanking to be somewhat more relaxing than many others seem to. I get to set the pace and make the pulls. All I have to worry about is wrapping up the mobs, positioning them, and waiting til they die. I rarely lose threat unless somebody is actually *trying* to pull. Again, don't need to worry about meters or people's health since I can see I have aggro. It is the polar opposite of healing though in that I know the exact layout of everything, where every mob and patrol is, what all of them do, who to force-pull and who will come to me, etc. <br /> <br />DPS is sort of split for me. On my warlock it's easy. Stand by the healer, have the time to see everything happening, simple rotation, big DPS, and I can easily pull a runner off a healer or other dps if needed. On my melee toons I find it more stressful than tanking honestly. Both my warrior and rogue I seem to have to find *just* the right place to attack from and dance around wherever the tank happens to be dragging them before starting in on a more complicated priority matrix of abilities; I can never seem to see what's going on or anything with me, the tank, the mobs, and any other melee all stacked up in a pile under the flashing damage numbers and DBM warnings. And with all DPS, it is of course a customary and mandatory recount wankfest wherein your only perceived value is how high your leet deeps is.</div>

Which is how the current heroic circuit has evolved (devolved?) to its current state. DPS feel compelled to &quot;win&quot; on recount so they pull at will. So tanks chain pull so as to stay a step ahead of them. Healers either cruise along or crack and start screaming. Anybody who doesn't like speed runs is screwed. People have Coren down so well it takes like 10 secs from zone-in. A guildy dared try to greet the group and Coren was dead and group disbanded by the time she typed. Heroics are similar; no talking; no planning; no stopping. Just GO already. <br /> <br />Personally I don't mind this so much. My wife hates it. She is constantly trying to talk to people in groups and then gets frustrated when people start screaming at her to JUST GO ALREADY!!!!! <br /> <br />But yes, I would agree that most dps make things harder than they need to be. I don't which irritates me more, the mid-geared mage standing in 2 black holes at once in DTK to pad the meters or the ZOMG6k/Kingslayer warrior doing 1200 dps all through a run.  </div>

Relatively few people want to run a heroic or direbrew for the fun of it. Most people are just there for the badges and want to get it over with as quickly as possible (and the new 80s who do actually want the heroic gear just get carried by the other 4 people.) 'Proper' tanking and planning and CC and stuff isn't needed or wanted when it's faster and easier to just blow everything up in a matter of seconds, claim your badges, and leave. <br /> <br />We saw this in BC too. When BC first hit, heroics were really hard. They required good gear, good tank and healer, CC, etc. Flash forward a year and two tiers worth of gear though and people just blasted through everything same way they do now (especially if you had a paladin tank.) <br />  <br />  <br />As for the people not talking bit, I blame the LFG tool for a lot of that. Groups form already complete so there's no general chatting as you try to form a complete group, and even when you're in the group it's usually with people from other servers who you'll never see or talk to ever again. <br /> <br />It's sad though because chatting and just hanging out when instancing tends to make the whole experience much more laid back and fun.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Yeah DPS can be extremely lazy and irritating. Having come from other MMOs where you're supposed to watch how much damage you're putting out, it's weird to me that people can't do the same in WoW once in a while. On hunter I'm constantly MDing the tank, not just because it's convenient for them, but to cover all the idiots that start attacking before the tank even has a chance to pull. When I'm tanking on my paladin, sometimes I go a little slower; especially if my heals is under-geared or low on mana.. the DPS just want to gogogo though. &quot;Hurry up! Let's get this over with!&quot; &quot;Pull tank, you suck!&quot; .. I guess at this point I just become confused. If I leave, I can get another group in 20 seconds. That @#%^ DPS has to wait another 15-20min. Why would you harass someone in that situation?<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Faith 75 Monk Valefor <br />Avril 80 Hunter Burning Legion <br /> <br />&quot;This is sickening!

We BARELY have enough MP to cast 5x GB, Seal, and Righteous Fury without OOMing). <br /> <br />Otherwise, the more damage we take, the more MP we get: We get MP from being healed, and we get MP from dodging/blocking/parrying, AND we get MP from Divine Plea being up full-time. If a Paladin Tank OOMs, something is definitely wrong. We'd have to be casting heals or something, to run out of MP (or, off-tanking, which we absolutely suck at, as we don't get MP unless we're taking hits). <br /> <br />I hate people who tell me to pull faster. If I'm not pulling faster, there's a reason. Maybe the healer isn't ready, maybe I see people at 50% health and I want them 100% health before they go flying into the mobs and getting killed to AoE/Splash damage, maybe something happened IRL (somebody trying to talk to me and I didn't want anyone to die while my attention is divided), maybe I'm having a lag spike, whatever. <br /> <br />The Tank is the leader. He controls the pulls, he controls what is pulled, where. <br /> <br />DPS need to learn this, and learn to leave group if they don't like the Tank's methods.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">With Respect to the tanks needing crazy gear to do the most basic stuff - Yes.  People are horribly lazy and don't want challenge.  Generally this is the DPS - As you point out. <br /> <br />This stems from two sources.  First - The DPS are generally the easiest played classes - thus if jack-assery is to be found - it's often found among their ranks.  Second - The DPS are forced to wait for 20+ minutes for a run - thus they are generally frustrated and annoyed to begin with.  So the moment they sense a weak tank or healer (or occasionally fellow DPS) - they turn on them.  Hey - they took 20 minutes to wait and now they want/demand success. <br /> <br />With respect to the lack of CC or whatever...  Well, it's generally not needed in Wrath and thus they have been spoiled.  I remember when my main job was to Sheep.  From the tank back in Shattered Halls:  &quot;Lock and Rogue, do you're thing, but Mage - I don't care what you do - so long as 'Moon' stays sheeped until I break it.&quot;  Back then a good mage knew how to reapply sheep.  I honestly do not recall the last time I used the spell.  Really - I'm not joking.  It used to be &quot;=&quot; on my keybindings because it was out of the way, but easily found and I used it often.  I unbound it a few months ago.   <br /> <br />As to your point about 'instant' or 'snap-on' AOE agro....  Perhaps it's a good thing.  Perhaps holding the attention of an entire instance isn't helping the game.  Will it be tougher to Paly tank - Yeah, I guess.  But maybe if we can get the damn DPS to CC - we can find a happy medium between Wrath (AOE) and TBC (Shattered Halls)...<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Most things you worry about never happen anyway.</div></div>

And while I don't think that instances need to go back to that level of craziness, the AoE zergfest that was WotLK got boring really quickly. It'd be nice to see some skill and finesse on the part of the whole group required again to complete instances without wiping. Does this mean that LFG will be a terrible place for a while? Possibly. But in the long run, it'll be good for the game overall.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">This stems from two sources. First - The DPS are generally the easiest played classes - thus if jack-assery is to be found - it's often found among their ranks. Second - The DPS are forced to wait for 20+ minutes for a run - thus they are generally frustrated and annoyed to begin with. So the moment they sense a weak tank or healer (or occasionally fellow DPS) - they turn on them. Hey - they took 20 minutes to wait and now they want/demand success. </div></div> <br /> <br />I don't think DPS are the easiest classes to play.  <br /> <br />What I see is that we are used to having the tank and the healer make up for all the faults on DPSers. So that <u>we leave DPSers nothing to care about other than the amount of damage that they do</u>. <br /> <br />1. DPS has to keep themselves alive by avoiding aggro and other sources of avoidable damage, and when needed, they have to use defensive cooldowns to avoid the aggro or mitigate damage. <br /> <br />2. DPS has to measure the mobs in contrast to the group, determine which are most threatning so that they counter them and prioritize properly. For most heroics it's 100% about doing AoE spam, but when it isn't, it isn't. <br /> <br />3. DPS has to do interrupts and balance the trade-off of spending an interrupt to avoid a large amount of incoming damage or to prevent a healing move from restoring massive amounts of enemy HP. <br /> <br />4. They also have manage their various miscelaneous abilities that significantly help groups by reducing the effort required or improving the effect of their abilities. <br /> <br />Instead, we get DPS pulling aggro, getting killed from it without ever using any of their defensive cooldowns and it's the tank that needs to &quot;learn2taunt&quot; and the healer that needs to &quot;learn2heal&quot;. <br /> <br />And this has a huge impact on tanks, the reason is, the DPSers that tend to take too much avoidable damage burden healers, sometimes (mostly on bosses that like to draw circles on the floor) they can burden healers to a point that they can't keep up the heals and the tank dies. Trust me, tanks are very easy to keep up when the DPS don't overburden healers. <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Oct  5th 2010  2:35am by xorq </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>NOTE: I may post comments about my like/dislike/approval/disapproval of game features. <br />1- They are NOT a complaint.

It's (almost) impossible to have a group fail when I'm tanking on my warrior, which I can't say for my paladin healer. <br /> <br />DPSing at the highest levels takes just as much effort as tanking. But the rewards (marginally faster run, marginally higher DPS) tend to make it easier to just mindlessly spam AoE. It's ok, I'm keeping my /assist and CC skills sharp - hopefully in Cata, it'll be worth using them again.</div>

That just means it's easiest to eek by in the current environment as a DPS.  It doesn't mean performing well as a DPS is the easiest &quot;job&quot;. <br /> <br />Looking at the difficulty of heroics at a time when everyone overgears the content is kind of pointless.  It's easy for everyone.  Dealing with retards in your group is the only challenge at this point. <br /> <br />On difficult or new content the hardest part of the game is coordinating with your group and working as a team.  I submit that DPS are responsible for most of that coordination.  They are required to work with the other two DPS and the tank to prioritize kill targets, interrupt orders, CC etc...  Healing and tanking difficulty scale with the competency of your DPS. <br /> <br />A group with 3 strong, smart DPS will put most healers to sleep, and make tanks feel invincible.  A group with a bunch of goons behind their toons will make a healer feel helpless and frustrated and force tanks to play Arcane Mages for relief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />As far as DPS being spoiled by wrath, I think the problem is partly the random dungeon tool here.  You are dealing with randomly selected people who are incentivized to grind the sh*t out of old boring content for badges to get raid level gear.  They are not going to be all smiles and sunshine when their tank is actually looking to get drops from Heroic Nexus or w/e.  I think it's a design flaw that we have people with such large gear disparities running the same content. <br /> <br />When Cataclysm comes, at least initially, we'll all be starting from a gear reset and a clean slate.  Those DPS will be humbled and STFU.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Homer no function beer well without.</div></div>

The old heroics I do them in shadow spec with my priest, playing the role of DPS but queueing as healer for shorter queue. I only need to throw heals between pulls and at bosses, without even switching spec, and at many of the bosses I do not need to heal at all.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Problem is that people are spoiled - most folks doing heroics are doing them for a specific achievement or frost badges or occasionally a trinket or other item which is still useful to a person with a 5k+ GS - meaning that they just want to get from point A to B as fast as possible so that they can get back to doing whatever they do after they get their daily frost badges. <br /> <br />Next up on the spoiled list is their personal DPS - nothing pisses off a high end DPS more then a tank with a 2k lower GS who forces said DPS to calm down or ends up losing aggro (and God forbid you &quot;cause&quot; someone to die because that DPS pulled a group on his own and you didn't score insta ag on it), so you've got some tantrums there as well. <br /> <br />Finally you've got the healers, who quite frankly are getting lazy and spoiled thanks to so many tanks out there only needing the occasional top off every other pull and even after having pulled a quarter of the instance.  Lazy healers who suddenly discover that they not only have to heal the tank, but also the stupid DPS who insist on going full burn on a mob despite knowing the tank's GS is too low to keep pace get upset real fast at having to actually work during instances again. <br /> <br />So there's the three issues which are causing you problems - peeps upset that you can't give them a 15m run, 5.5k GS DPS who wont/don't want to slow down and healers who suddenly are finding they have to do more then keep the tank targetted and occasionally hit a heal button.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>OK, yeah, maybe us druids are a tad overpowered <br /> <br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl0PQHT34_0&amp;NR" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl0PQHT34_0&amp;NR" rel="external nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl0PQHT34_0&amp;NR</a> <br /> <br />You may be a feral druid if... <br /> <br /><a href="http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/class.html?wclass=6;mid=116937588840616132" title="http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/class.html?wclass=6;mid=116937588840616132" rel="external nofollow">http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/class.html?wclass=6;mid=116937588840616132</a> <br /> <br />Great virus links and advice from other users <br /> <br /><a href="/forum.html?forum=21;mid=1233014529277943190;page=1#m1233788962189142490" title="http://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21;mid=1233014529277943190;page=1#m1233788962189142490" rel="external">http://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21;mid=1233014529277943190;page=1#m1233788962189142490</a></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">xorq wrote:</div><div class="orig">I don't think DPS are the easiest classes to play. </div></div> <br /> <br />I do. <br /> <br />To counter your (xorq's) 4 points: <br /> <br /> <br />1): Avoiding Aggro and Damage Zones: Damage Zones are what everyone laughs at: &quot;Don't stand in the fire nub!&quot; Seriously, if moving out of Damage zones is that freaking hard, then we might as well fill dungeons and raids with level 1 mobs. The only time where this would ever become an issue, is if there's lag, and if there's that much lag, well... some nights are just not good dungeon/raid nights. As for reaching the aggro threshold, there's no excuse for this. The Built-In aggro meter works just fine; if you see orange around your nameplate and you're not the tank, STOP PRESSING BUTTONS (unless they are defensive or threat-reducing) and/or turn around, walk through the mob so your back is facing it, do whatever you have to do. It is an easy concept. <br /> <br />2): Even before Wrath came out with its stupidly easy dungeons, tanks/raid leaders have been marking Kill Orders way back in BC. I imagine they'll probably continue to do it even now. Is it that hard? &quot;Durrr Skull &gt; X &gt; Circle Durrrrr&quot; Also there's /assist tank. <br /> <br />3). Using interrupts is nothing new either. Of course, during Wrath, everybody was spoiled into the &quot;who cares just DPS it!&quot; I was never in that bunch myself, if I saw Shadow Blast in Old Kingdom for example, I interrupted it every damn time I saw it. If I saw a mob casting a heal, I interrupted it. I've always been doing this, and it is something that should be automatic to any good player. The bads will have to either shape up, or ship out. It isn't &quot;hard&quot;, per-se: Most of the &quot;MUST INTERRUPT THIS!&quot; moves/spells have a long casting timer, and or the boss freaking shouts what he's doing, and/or the game gives you RAID WARNINGS. What more do you want Blizz to do, make your character use said interrupts automatically so you don't have to? <br /> <br />4). Basically, you mean buffs, and debuffs, right? If that is &quot;Hard&quot; for a DPS to do, then I'm sorry... maybe they should go back to soloing. Buffs should be automatic; debuffs are usually hard-wired into the rotation, except for maybe things like Demo Shout. Not to mention many DPS' buffs/debuffs overlap anyways; Demo Shout and Vindication for example. <br /> <br />So no, I can't see where DPS have a more challenging time than Tanks and Healers. The challenge is, and has always been, Healer &gt; Tank &gt; DPS.</div>

I think they also said they wanted to do similar to Rogues? <br /> <br />But then for that matter, they are trying to make healing better too. <br /> <br />But as it stands, in Wrath, 90% of the time, DPS is dead last in challenge, with the healers on top as the &quot;OMG, you can't do ANYTHING wrong!&quot; and tanks being somewhere in the middle, depending on which class you're playing. <br /> <br />Edit2: Also, the Gear equivalent: Increasing your gear as a DPS has a direct, easily-seen number representation. A bad DPS who doesn't know his exact rotation, and/or who isn't <i>quite</i> optimized can just grab a few pieces of the next tier when it comes out and increase his DPS by a good margin, even if his technique is still sub-optimal. However, a tank who is letting mobs hit him in the back, a tank that is failing to use things like Shield Block, Holy Shield, etc, a tank who is failing to pop cooldowns when needed is still going to take far more damage than he should, even if he adds a little extra stam and avoidance. And then, the healer, doesn't matter how much +spellpower, +crit, and +haste you stick on, a bad healer who has poor reaction times, doesn't know the fights, yadda yadda is still going to let people die regardless if he's wearing i200 or i251s. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Oct  6th 2010  7:55pm by Lyrailis </span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Oct  6th 2010  7:59pm by Lyrailis </span></i></div>
