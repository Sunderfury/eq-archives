      <div class="msgContentFrame">Well i have never written an &quot;I'm outta here&quot; post before. Usually i just go, like many have done who frequent these forums. There is however a first time for everything and personally I just want to get some stuff off my chest as I wash my hands of this game. Although not so much as a parting blow or final say, I just want to share my final complaint with this Final Fantasy. <br /> <br />I haven't encountered a single aspect of this game that doesn't make me pause, remove my hands from both mouse and keyboard and just sit there, perplexed, saying to myself - &quot;What were they thinking? Why on earth would something be intentionally designed that way&quot;. What were they thinking designing a chat interface that has no place in a 2010 game. Or what were they thinking in designing a menu system that makes you wait 5 to 15 seconds per action. A combat system that was sold to us under the banner of &quot;be anything, with just the switch of a weapon,&quot; but ultimately just makes you hash the same 4 buttons over and over again. The ability to solo in a world that is painfully dull to solo in, and the ability to party with people who are in it for the SP. No tactics, no team play. No life in both styles of play. <br /> <br />The crafting system is abysmal. I don't feel encouraged at all to craft in a rewarding environment, i feel forced to craft in a hostile environment against multiple RNG's  which hamper your progress to the point of multiple, inexplicable failures. This game is RNG pro to the point I feel the most disconnected I have ever felt in a game. There's no real need for me, if the game could press its own buttons i'd fair just as well. There's no skill, I can prepare myself but preparation is inconsequential. RNG's cannot truely be prepared for. This game is also anti RMT to the point that even as someone who doesn't know what the damned letters stand for I am surrounded by its presence. (does it mean Real Money Transfer?) There is no good analogy I can come up with to explain this, so i'll just say that the counter RMT measures are crippling the game to the point that the 80 or 90% of us who don't participate in it are far to greatly affected.  <br /> <br />I never played FF11, so cannot draw comparisons from it, but what I can do is draw comparisons from any other game I have bought because a game is a game, whether MMO, single player, board or text. FF games from my limited understanding of having only played the console ones, are long term investments of time and patience. They have sometimes very challenging scenarios mixed with a huge abundance of side-tracking things to do. I don't feel that there is anything truly hard, engaging or encouraging about 14. In just about every situation of crafting or fighting, leveling or progression, you are inexplicably punished after going about things in perhaps the greatest waste of personal time possible. nothing should be instant, but simple things like travel or repairs shouldn't take 50% of your gaming session. I don't want a billion side quests, but i don't want my choice of gaming to be grind mobs, farm resources, farm shards. What an earth have they been doing all these years? Yes it looks nice, but it doesn't take years to make a copy/paste landscape and characters with 4 faces.  <br /> <br />I guess the theme of this complaint post is disappointment derived from a painfully flawed game and a severe lack of encouragement in-game to muscle through. You read a lot that MMO's have shaky starts because they tried to do too much at once. Deliver on too many fronts. Seriously, this game doesn't strike me as something that went tits up because it tried to do too much at once. The one credit i can give this game is that everything works, essentially. From a technical standpoint it turns on, its plays, it turns off.  The game - in that respect - is stable, which a great many new MMO's flunk at. What this game flunks at, however, is everything else. Yes i can log in, but it doesn't change the fact I am logging into a slow, lifeless, beige world. There's a lot of things to do - apparently, but every single one of them bores me to tears. Click. wait. wait. wait. respond. click. wait. wait. wait. fail. <br /> <br />In short? Don't make me love this game through and through, but seriously don't go out of your way to make me hate it. Don't punish me so much, christ its a game. Games are designed to be fun, I just spent  hours at work (I have a fun job so its okay) When i go online I spend 45 minutes farming materials which was okay fun, fifteen minutes refining them through craft which was hit and miss fun, don't destroy my final synth! don't do that! Why is that even possible. Destroy my components if i fail, fine, whatever. Destroy my final. Why? It's lower skill than the components. Why would you make me fail it? That is almost my entire session lost to an RNG for something below my level. That wasn't fun. That was a kick in balls, as so many people say.  In regards to adventuring, don't hold my hand, I wouldn't mind being pointed in the right direction but I can get there myself if all you do is encourage me. What do we get instead. Here's eight quests, go at 'em. Minimal SP. Minimal reward. All done? No, you failed some. Too bad, better luck next time. Go kill dodo's. Make yarn over and over. Try making cloth with your yarn (snicker). I'll have the same quests for you in a day and a half. <br /> <br />Final Fantasy - final complaint. <br /> <br />Take care everyone. And if you want my stuff the answer is no. Mainly because I have next to nothing after my 30 days, but also because it'll take too gawd darned long for me to trade with you. I'm an awesome person, and the people on these forums and in game are awesome too. It's just a shame that 14 fell so far short. <br /> <br />Buh-byes.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Bought this game last a week ago Saturday.  This. Game. Is. Horrible. <br /> <br />The UI is painfully clunky and slow.  I cannot for the life of me figure out how the developers walked away from this UI feeling intelligent.  It is a phenomenal piece of crap. Even far older MMO's (or just video games in general) have far superior UI's.  The fact that it isn't -at all- customizable makes it even worse.  This is the most disappointing thing about this game.  The UI ruins an already fairly poor gaming experience. <br /> <br />The camera is a piece of crap, I cannot stand how the camera behaves.   <br /> <br />No auto attack?  An added mechanic for special moves in the form of stamina on top of TP? The special moves are completely independent? The battle system is painfully brainless and boring, there is nothing, and I do mean nothing, good about it.  Huge snore fest that will lead to a severe case of carpel tunnel.  <br /> <br />Just when I thought no crafting system could ever be worse than FFXI they come out with this crap on FFXIV.  I'm at a loss for words on this.  Failing synthesis, tedious method of picking mats, tons of &quot;are you sure?&quot; selections, and lag between choices makes me want to vomit in my mouth. <br /> <br />Utterly no learning curve, you are literally slapped in the world with your weapon and that's it.  No hints on where to find leves or what the heck a leve even is.   <br /> <br />This game has the feel as if it were haphazardly slapped together and put in a pretty box.  I've tried to give this game a fair shake but unless Square does something quick and epic, this game is easily the worst thing they've ever produced.  I wouldn't recommend this game to Osama Bin Ladin, much less any of my friends. <br /> <br />In conclusion I think I'll get my free 30-days out of it to see if they attempt to make some major improvements, if not, I guess I can look forward to playing Cataclysm on WoW. <br /> <br />-NW <br /> <br /><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Not here. <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I took a break from the game and ill explain why. <br /> <br />Everything running smoothly with some annoyances of course but there i am crafting like crazy, farming for mats and shards but the botany part was most bearable although still quite boring. <br />I currently have 1 battlefield class (DOW-DOM) which is conjurer and i had this at lvl 10 plus i could make my own hempen gear and staffs. <br />Now as i level up craft classes i have to farm for the shards and mats with my CON and farm so much that i level up as i do. Now at lvl6 CON i have to focus on cotton gear and lvl up the other classes to make that stuff. <br />Now after farming and leveling up them craft classes my CON is nearly ready for Canvas gear. <br />So basically all i do is craft and farm which got super boring. <br />Why don't i buy the stuff for my CON? Because i can't afford the ridiculous price for new robe or staff. <br />Although not entirely true i can afford it but why would i drop 80% of my total GLD for something i wont be able to repair myself if im not properly prepared to repair it? <br />I can understand the crafting work to achieve a goal but the way your stuff wears out is just so ridiculous that kills not only the value of an item but destroys the fun in this game. <br />I could repair all my gear/weapon to 100% only to have it degrade in about an hour of just farming. <br /> <br />All this just makes no sense to me because you work and slave your butt off for something that doesn't even last for you. Then you either have to NPC it for 50% or spend hours trying to find someone who would repair for you. <br />This, above all has to be the most horribly annoying thing in the game. <br />  <br />SE really needs to extend this hour wear out thing to at least a week before you need to repair something but ide say get rid of it altogether. <br /> <br />So far i haven't played in 2 weeks and hope to return soon.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>One day maybe: <br />ShaolinGate.com</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I've been thru quite a few MMO launches....Anarchy Online was the worst with WoW coming in a close second. The launch of FFXIV was actually pretty smooth compared to alot of the MMOs I've purchased. I've found FFXIV to be more like a job than anything else: repititious, kind of boring, and not well thought out by the powers that be. Here are a couple observations an old MMOer (I go back to Meridian59) has seen. <br />1. I can't speak for the Asian population but, for the most part, Westerners enjoy a fast paced game. The transportation system here is basically non-existant. The &quot;anima&quot; system is mind boggling, at least in it's current state. Cutting the refresh rate in half only means you can go wherever you want 50% more of the time. Not a big deal IMO. <br />2. This game is apparently a &quot;crafting oriented&quot; MMO, something SE DID NOT advertise in any of their videos. Some would classify this as a &quot;bait and switch&quot; sales gimmick. There are no &quot;gear&quot; drops and only a precious few &quot;gear&quot; rewards. Had I known this game required tremendous amounts of crafting skills to make and repair items I wouldn't have bothered purchasing it. <br />3. Buying and selling items through a &quot;retainer&quot; borders on insanity. The &quot;fix&quot; here, as planned by SE, is to allow players to have more retainers and from what I've read, at a cost of $1 a month per retainer. If this is true a $13 a month game can easily become a $16 a month game. <br />4. Crafting Quest turn ins is, in alot of cases, bizaare. I took a level 1 crafting leve, completed it, only to find my poor level 9 character couldn't turn it in because I didn't have enough adventuring abilities and levels under my belt to actually get to the camp to turn it in. So, it remained in my journal for a couple weeks. Why? Because you can't delete quests. <br />5. I've never played a game where your inventory played such a crutial part in what you can and cannot do. If you have a character that utilizes 4 crafts, and you're an archer, you can forget about roaming too far from an NPC to sell your stuff and buy arrows. There should be a merchant at every camp. <br /> <br />The game is without doubt beautiful but, as in most cases, only skin deep. If you love to craft, this is your game. SE can sit back and say &quot;we're gonna do this and fix that&quot; but historically, in almost every game I've played, the Developer will patch their game into oblivion, creating new problems for the people who purchased it. I will never understand why a Game Developer can't sit down and look at all the great qualities of successful MMOs that are out there and combine those qualities into one superb game. Egos I imagine. </div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">FFXIV would be a nice add-on for FFXI. Especially the regional and local Leves, no EXP penalty, no more check/eam message.  However, a stand alone with itself is really unfullilling and empty even it has nice graphic. <br /> <br />Places/city has no life and uninspiring. in FFXI where all the cities feel organic and has a purpose and some of the places felt really sacred and mysterious. All these lacks in FFXIV even though the areas are much much bigger.  I remember I can't wait to explore the King Ranperre's tomb, Ordelle's cave...etc. <br /> <br />Secondly, no Beastmen? None? The Orc's outpost was really such as fun journey and PLD's AF was in Davoi.  No Beastmen even in Mor Dhona other than some fat pigs? Whats the story and purpose of FFXIV other than crafting?  I don't look forward to grind EXP without any inspiration and fun factors or story driven elements.  And I have to pay for that? <br /> <br />Mobs placement? It is unbalanced, lazy and not thoughtful.  I was really stunned to see how beautiful Coerthas is until I saw the the Switzerland like place has some houses built along the main road. Oh, there is a big frigging toad and dragon walking infront of the house? WTF?  <br /> <br />There are so many success elements that SE could have just copy from FFXI and upgrade it and that would have made FFXIV a great success. Imagine put all the FFXIV game mechanism into FFXI and you will see how many people gonna bitch.  <br /> <br />DEX and 2 hand weapon dose not work and I dont understand why SE fail at this again. <br /> <br />Who wanna to play mage if they ending up being short change on getting EXP and only serves as a healing bot?  Ancient spell is broken. <br /> <br />All the job classes are uninspired while most of the job classes are fun in FFXI except the nerfed RNG and DRG. <br /> <br />You want people to pay and stay? It has gotta be fun, inspiring and story telling with good amount of challenges. It is only somewhat fun but repetitous. The only thing I been enjoying so far is Leve and SE has limitation on SE. I think I am gonna quit but will wait until after the NOV update and see.  Most of my FFXI has stopped logging on or holding on buying this game. <br /> <br />The best thing SE should do now is to have Tanaka resign and apologize to the customers. Appoint a new director and reinvent the game completely. I am losing faith on this brand based on FFXIII and now FFXIV.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/409483.png" height="144" width="482" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Yet another ridiculous game element... <br /> <br />As I try to conserve anima I usually run between Ul-Dah and the Limsa ferry. Today I get through the gates and walk down to the dock. The ferry is sitting there, but as anyone knows who has ever travelled on it SE thinks we are too stupid to board it ourselves. I check a few people bazaars while I am waiting and then.... <br /> <br /> <br />The ferry leaves without me. Really? REALLY!? What, you have to be through the gate before the ferry lands at the docks? DAMMIT SE!! Pull your collective heads out of your director's a$$ and make just 1 phreaken thing that WORKS <br /> <br /> <br />I swore to myself that I would wait until the November update (or my renewal date whichever comes first) to make a decision on whether to stay or go, but you are making it VERY VERY hard for me to stay.  <br /> <br />Its like playing a game that was designed for a 4th grader. I NEED a LOT more than this crap to keep me interested.  <br /> <br />And one more thing, if all you are going to 'update' weekly is &quot;- An issue where the client would automatically shut down when the user canceled out of synthesis has been addressed.&quot; or &quot;- Increased server capacity has been implemented.&quot; (Lodestone Oct 28)  <br /> <br />Don't waste your time. First the client is automatically shutting down because its board to tears with this steaming pile of dung you call a game. Second, on my server, and from what I have gathered reading the Zam forums, server populations are dropping daily. For those of you in software development who are apparently too stupid to code in a simple inventory sort (yes, I am talking YOU SE development team) Reduced users DOES NOT = a need for MORE server capacity. Unless of course you are already making plans to merge? <br /> <br />God I am sick of these worthless weekly 'updates'. Ya, I get it, you have something special planned 'eventually' but in the meantime these updates are like opening up your last gift on your 7th birthday and getting SOCKS! <br /> <br />Throw me a bone here SE, this game is so awful that even free no longer seems like a good price.  <br /> <br />-Teeg<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>When they said FFXIV would be like no game before it this isn't exactly what I had in mind.</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">There really isn't much more that I can add that hasn't been said in this thread already. I've cancelled my account and moved on to a much better game. The game population is relatively small but friendly and outgoing. The UI is responsive and flexible, every game mechanic is explained thoroughly to those who require it, there's thousands of quests to do, crafting is actually fun and useful, the sweeping music fades out at an appropriate time to ambient sounds, the Auction House is lightning-fast and efficient, there are player and guild houses to deck out, and though the graphic quality is dated by today's standards, the zone design is varied and interesting without consistently being an obstacle. In other words, it is everything FFXIV is not. <br /> <br />I do sincerely wish the players who are staying the best, and I'd like to thank Square one last time for the fun I had with XI, not to mention the older titles.

I still grasp on to the hope they will get back to their roots, put on the work boots and work to inspire...not to just be different and try to keep up with other MMO's....its just a sad time and hope they get it right soon on this game is going to tank and that is depressing to think about.  <br /> <br />Cheers and I hope we see some good changes soon.... <br />   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">What's been bothering me lately: <br /> <br />Take the following issue ---- <br /> <br />When selecting an item on your equipment layout, the cursor jumps over to a RANDOM point on your inventory list. Its not like it simply doesn't just go to the right item, it goes to any item. So you are left completely guessing as to which ring of 4 you're trying to unequip. Yes it tells you on top &quot;Right Index Finger&quot; but unless you've memorized each box, the info is useless. <br /> <br />Add to this the fact that the inventory list incredibly doesn't only list the items avaible for that slot when equipping and you have to start wondering, who on earth is in charge at Square Enix. <br /> <br />Which brings me to what's been bothering me... WHO in their right mind would make the decision to allow that type of glaring issue be part of a finished released major game????? I mean seriously? Are SE's managers a bunch of monkeys?? Someone, some actual person, looked at the behavior of the inventory list when equipping and unequipping and made the conscious decision that this was acceptable for the FINAL game. UNREAL. <br /> <br />Multiply this by about 100 issues just as insanely unacceptable and you have a picture of why we are where we are right now. I try and rationalize this to defend the game when reading all the negativity on the forums lately - but I come up completely empty. There's no excuse for the state in which FFXIV was released and I can hardly blame or rebuke anyone for taking SE to task about it.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Wada: &quot;There may be some areas of testing that were lacking or too rigid.&quot;</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Well here's a complaint, the shoddy and terrible fleeing enemy bug. I don't mean the leve one, I mean the one where you're fighting an enemy and it keeps running away and recovering HP. Tonight 2 LS members and myself tried to take on some Magicked Bones in a cave slightly south of Cedarwood in La Noscea. We prepared and went in. We tried the first skeleton only to find it runs to us a short distance, stops, the runs back and does a full regen. Suddenly the one in the center of the cave decides to join in and attacks us, mid attack it puts its weapon away and flees to the center of the cave again. So, regroup and try to pull the middle one. Here's where it gets worse... No matter HOW much we try to fight the center it keeps fleeing back to the center of the cave even if it's just a few feet away from its spot... This keeps happening ENDLESSLY. After dying, twice, we just said screw it and gave up. <br /> <br />The regen bug on these ones is SO bad it regens even if you fight it right where it stands, it just keeps doing it repeatedly. And if you TRY to fight it there the other on the side aggros you, comes down to attack then runs back up to its spot and repeats this. Seriously, every 5 seconds it's doing this. So just a note, if you come across this cave don't waste your time on these skeletons, they just keep regenerating continuously making them damned near impossible to beat. And these were blue by the way to two 22 CON and a 21 GLA. <br /> <br />EDIT: And the sucky part about this is some Magicked Bones spawned above ground during the night hours. Fighting these I was getting an easy 300-400 SP per battle for just a trio party. Since the ones in the cave were uncamped we decided to take those ones on. The battles prior were really easy to do so it's not like this was bad idea, just the skeletons in the cave there wouldn't stop regenerating HP thanks to the bug. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  7th 2010  4:40am by SamusKnight </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>FINAL FANTASY XIV Roleplayer <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/667415.png" height="144" width="482" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br />Sair Gammonari - Hyur Midlander Male - Conjurer <br />Mihana Zhralyia - Miqo'te Seeker of the Sun Female - Archer <br /> <br /></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Most things I can look past, though my list of complaints has been rather long. The game has so much potential, but it's a shame I don't think there will be a chance for it to reach that potential if some of the basic concerns aren't addressed.  <br /> <br />The one major thing I'm having issues looking past is SP from battle. I have a set group for the most part. They run when I do, yet I'm forced to run extra time to stay in range because the SP is so unbalanced between classes it's ridiculous. If a group of people spends 5 hours grinding, shouldn't all of those people get relatively the same amount of SP at the end of the night if nobody hits fatigue? Last night I spent a few hours with friends trying to catch up. I got about 6k, someone else got over 10k and someone else got around 2k. What a mess.  <br /> <br />Without the use of vent, communication in the game is a joke. The chat box constantly clearing, lack of ctrl+r working until I type out a person's name the first time, lack of space alotted for typing... All of this makes communication in a game based on interacting with people so not worth it. <br /> <br />Linkshell management is another pain. If someone quits the game that is in the shell, which is happening a lot, they can't be removed? If they are online causing issues, we basically have to chase them down to be within range of them to remove them? Really?? If I can see the list of people in the shell when they are offline, why can't I manage it? Why must someone be in my range to invite them to a party. In a crowded area where it takes 10 minutes for people to load, why can't I just use a simple text command to invite them? And why must the party leader be basically up my rear for me to be able to gain sp/xp/loot from a mob? What if they have to run back to town to repair something or get something. The entire party is forced to stop doing anything if lead isn't passed, because just like with the linkshell, can't do anything like that unless if you are standing next to the person. In a game where damage is taken on gear and the damaged gear can effect sp, if you don't have a crafter who can repair for you in the group, you do sometimes need to run back to town. It should not force the other people to stop. So let's lose the bonus for the person not being in range that we'd get for them being near, let them not be able to get xp/sp/loot, but why must the party leader be there? And if that's going to be the case, why can't the party leader pass lead if they aren't standing with the group. <br /> <br />Did we really need 4 types of every mat? This takes up inventory space way too fast and again, if someone needs to run back to town to clean inventory and they happen to be party lead and forget to pass, everyone is stuck waiting. <br /> <br />If I'm going to be forced to put ingredients in a little window with that kind of interface lag when I craft, can I have a repeat synth action that automatically fills it out for me if I'm making a lot of one thing? I really do enjoy crafting, even with the randomness, but the time consumption is insane. And most of it is caused by the interface lag. <br /> <br />And onto the market ward complaint that everyone else has. This system is a pain. Even when the search feature is implemented, with interface lag and inventory congestion, it can sometimes take way too long to set up a retainer's bazaar to sell thing. And what if you have 10 different things that belong in 10 different wards? Where is the best place to place the retainer? It's a pain to go into a ward looking for something that should be there, check 20 retainers to find none of them have anything for sale that have something to do with that particular ward. <br /> <br />In xi I enjoyed the bazaar system in conjunction with the ah. And I'm sure I would in this game as well. In an effort to stop rmt, basically a system was put in place that only rmt is going to have the time/energy to fully take advantage of. Though on the bright side, with the way people are dropping from this game, rmt won't be an issue since there won't be a market here. Though with my server population almost in half of what it was at launch, why is the lag not getting any better? The only noticeable difference with the lack of population it now takes a lot longer to get things repaired or to find things I need. And it's not like I have all the free time needed to take up every craft so I can do everything myself. And if I did, it's not like there is the space needed. <br /> <br />The priority of loading repair npcs is nice, but can we get some other load priority. Like maybe important npcs, party members, linkshell members, people on our friends list, then others? <br /> <br />Why can't the game remember how I have my action bars set for each class? I have to write multiple macros for each class I want to play to reset my bars. With interface lag doing it via menu is too time consuming. Is it really that hard to remember that these abilities were set here for pugilist and here for conjurer? Why should I have to slam multiple macros for gear and abilities each time I want to change. It really makes me not want to check out other classes that I may enjoy because I just don't want to go through the hassle of resetting my bars. Even with the macros things don't always reset correctly, and every two levels when I get some new abilities, my bars change. Which means, I get to spend a few minutes rewriting macros and if I don't and change class and change back I'm back to spending 5-10 minutes resetting my bars.  <br /> <br />Can we get a simple mail system please? If I wanted to make alts, in order to get things to the alt I'd either have to set it up for sale on my retainer and hope nobody beats my alt to the purchase or have a friend wait after I trade it to them to trade it to the alt. Blah. Even better when trying to help someone level a craft and holding onto mats I know they will need and not seeing them for days for whatever reason and eating up my inventory, where with a simple mail system, I could just send them these mats and get it out of my inventory. And again, with no AH, sometimes friends providing each other with mats that they need is the only way that they get it. Or even with parts, since a lot of synths take parts from 4 different crafts.  <br /> <br />Inventory wouldn't be such a mess, again, if we didn't have to deal with normal and hq mats. I find in most cases I'll just npc the hq versions, but if it's a mat of something I need to make a lot of, I really can't afford to do that. And it's not like it's a quick thing to sit down and do these synths to free up space. With the menu system and interface lag, it takes way too long to do anything. I usually have to set aside a few days a week for crafting strictly.  <br /> <br />Can we get some quests please? Quests that have side stories or expand the mission stories. Right now there are a bunch of npcs standing around town doing nothing, serving no real purpose. One of my favorite things about XI was the side stories that the quests presented. It made me care more about the world, the npcs, everything. It made it much more fun. Right now the quests we have feel like glorified outpost supply runs with better rewards the ability to later teleport to that outpost. While I do enjoy the leves, they do get old after awhile since there are no real quests to break things up. Some days I just want to log on, do some quests and explore. I don't want to grind, I don't want to do leves, I want to get sucked into the world and care about it. Right now it just feels like a rather blah backdrop since the main mission stories are so few and far between. When rank ups stopped being where I could do the missions on a weekly basis, I am finding I care less about the world, which is what usually kept me coming back in XI. The little bit of the missions I've seen I've liked. I just want more. I want more things to suck me into the world. <br /> <br />When something is broke, it should be easier to see what it is. Maybe gray it out or do something to it on the equipment screen? <br /> <br />And for the love of all that is good in a game, can we get a way to follow that is less clunky? A simple /follow would be nice. <br /> <br />XI had it's share of issues, and the response time to taking care of them was insanely long. It also did a lot right too. Why was the stuff that worked redone in a way that it feels broken or convoluted.  <br /> <br />I really hope that they become a lot more communicative about the fixes and a lot more responsive. Right now, I'm not sure how much longer I can give this game. Again, there is a lot about it I really do like. But right now it feels like a beta test for the ps3 launch with the only difference, when that launches I won't have to restart my character and lose my progress. <br /> <br />How the early adopters are treated can make or break this game. Many I know left XI in disgust and were hesitant about trying this one. While the extra 30 days free was nice, if it's still going to feel like a beta test after the charges start, I really am wondering how alone in my linkshell and on my server I will find myself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  8th 2010  1:25am by Nandani </span></i></div>

Yes it tells you on top &quot;Right Index Finger&quot; but unless you've memorized each box, the info is useless. <br /> <br />Add to this the fact that the inventory list incredibly doesn't only list the items avaible for that slot when equipping and you have to start wondering, who on earth is in charge at Square Enix.</div></div> <br /> <br />Sometimes the little things irk the most, and this reminded me of one.  Another &quot;feature&quot; of the inventory list - as you scroll down it, the item description box expands and contracts to show the available information, and in the process your <br />cursor moves up or down to an adjacent inventory item and the bloody description box changes to show the item now in focus!  How demented is that? <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Yeah, I'm ready to get out.  An extra 30 days free play wasn't even worth it - I haven't hardly played at all since October 22.  Every now and then I log in hoping that something will make me want to play, but nothing does.  Same crap time after time. <br /> <br />What the heck am I supposed to do with that &quot;Crysta&quot; I bought too when I first got the game, and why the heck did I buy it to begin with???  I thought there would be something I might want for the game with it, but I don't even know how to use it (can we even use it yet?)  Can I get my money/Crysta back?  Probably not.  Instead I'm going to have a game I don't want to play and money totally and completely wasted.  I even bought the collectors edition too because that's what I like to do when I get a game I like.  Unfortunately, I trusted too much that this game would be worth it.  It was not. <br /> <br />So, anyway, now what do I do with that crysta I purchased that I can't use?  More freaking wasted money! <br /> <br />Damn, what was I thinking?? <br /> <br />~M~ <br /> <br />*UPDATE* <br />Mkay, so I can't get the Crysta back, so I guess I'll still have the game running another two months off if it instead.  =\  Who knows, maybe they'll come up with something to make me want to play?  I'm not real optimistic about that though . . . <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 13th 2010  2:22pm by Mimotep </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Just Play - Have Fun!</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Honestly, I have never complained about a game outside of conversations with friends before, but I do have something to say that might be a small break from the typical complaints we're seeing here. <br /> <br />Let me start by saying that I fully expect any game, upon release, to be full of annoying bugs. All games I've ever played at release have been. This isn't any exception. Nor do I think that the combat and game, in general, is any more boring than FFXI was at the beginning - though I gladly grinded(ground?) my way through that game. I'd agree that the game is clearly unfinished, but what I see as being the most glaringly painful aspect of this game is simple: there is a complete divergence between the 'philosophy' the creators used when designing the game and the actual game itself. <br /> <br />Consider this: <br />Nobuaki Komoto said, &quot;First off, the main concept behind FFXIV is allowing those players with little time on their hands to play effectively, and game balance is based off of that. Furthermore, it is being designed to not give those with more time on their hands to play an unfair advantage.&quot; <br /> <br />Here, Mr. Komoto is defending SE's decision to implement the fatigue system (which I happen to like). HOWEVER, the real question is what he means when he says 'time on their hands to play effectively'. Effectively? See, my imagination dictates to me that effectiveness, within the context of video game design, is like the wonderful hybrid between smooth and efficient. Maybe even so smooth and efficient that you CAN accomplish <u>something</u> in a few hours each day. <br /> <br />After a few weeks, it is clear that FFXIV's game design is anything but efficient. This is the part where I launch into my complaints which are somewhat pertinent to my topic, but may be the same since we play the same game - so if you've had enough of these, stop reading now. <br /> <br />- Why does it take me 3 hours to outfit myself to level 6-7 items (from level 1 items)? It isn't just that I am  a bargain shopper, it's that I can't actually find anything I'm looking for. I check PC bazaars in guilds and elsewhere; I frequent the APPROPRIATE market wards (and the Battlecraft Ward which appears to be where everyone sets up) on a regular basis. I even use my oh-so precious anima points to warp around to different cities to check for goods. I just can't find anything! <br /> <br />- They want us to level many different classes at the same time, yet, I have NO ROOM in my inventory to do so. Even if I wear all/all gear, and avoid wearing jewelry, I have very little room for loot. If I want to level efficiently, I have to delete or vendor-trash my items... which leads me to my next point. <br /> <br />- Selling items to vendors, moving items in and out of your inventory, and loading critical windows should NOT take up a more-than-incredibly-small amount of your total game time. I have never in any game, even during EQ in 2000, had to spend so many minutes and/or just trying to balance my inventory. Which leads me to another point... <br /> <br />- Currently, combat and crafting are half-awesome and half-terribad. Combat itself is very boring, but the items you obtain from slaying monsters are very exciting (so many useful items and they drop so often). However, for this to REMAIN exciting, you need to spend a great deal of time returning to camp to sell half of your booty. Or pray once you get to your retainer, he/she has sold something. The alternative is to take all that stuff and craft with it! I love crafting, and I initially loved crafting in FFXIV, but it is SUCH a PITA. There is no menu to select recipes you already know, you cannot choose to craft multiple of the same items, most items require sub-combines from other classes, which require sub-combines from other classes, which require sub-combines from... on so on. I am completely open to a *complicated* crafting system, but not without an EQ-like bazaar or a Every-other-MMO-like auction house system. In order to create the item you want, you have to carefully decide what items you are going to need to keep during your adventures for the next 14 levels, which generally ends up being every item you get if you plan on leveling multiple classes. A maximum of 180 inventory slots means you're full by level 15-20.(Note: I even tried buying another character slot to help with the item load, but without mail the transferring is incredibly slow, tedious, and unhelpful). <br /> <br />- Anima regeneration is pathetic. 10 hours per point? 6 points to travel outside of the zone you're in? so... roughly 3 Earth days to teleport across the world once? Two Earth days to travel from the camp you're currently at to the one a mile south of you? Very very friendly to the casual player who, if they play an hour or two every day, would require an entire day of playtime to run from Ul'dah to La Noscea. <br /> <br />- I LOVE the idea of gear that wears down because it keeps crafters and cities (especially after expansions) in business. However, the rate at which your gear wears down, and the inability to repair it to 100% without assistance from a crafter or leveling all but two of the crafting classes is pure ridiculousity*! I actually FEAR moving away from the city because doing so will vastly increase the time I spend running around every hour or so when my gear is breaking. God forbid the day I go to gain exp in a zone outside the newbie ones. Just dumb, dumb, dumb. Not being able to repair gear to 100% without player help OR having to find a repairer quite frequently are INDIVIDUAL punishments. Together they're pretty severe. And the behavior being punished is PLAYING! <br /> <br />- This may be my own issue, but is there like... zero chat in FFXIV? I know there are people that speak English on Gestahl, but I've only seen about 4 (shout)messages in two and a half weeks. I have absolutely no reason to ever come into contact with another person except to b**ch at them for ninja-claiming the squirrel I was going for... and I'm not that kind of player. The only thing that sets MMOs apart from other games is the community, I see little game-related benefit to engaging yourself with one in FFXIV. (Note: I've asked to join groups but never receive a message back, the translator function seems to only translate a few, and very specific, phrases... no carryover from XI?) <br /> <br />- While it is all fine and dandy that SE limits the productivity I get from the game after some amount of time (fatigue system) - I should not have to pay 10.99 or whatever for a month for that limitation. Most &quot;casual&quot; games made specifically for &quot;casual&quot; players don't charge, or charge less, than the major franchises. This amount is only lower than most games if you only play one character; playing more will cost you anywhere from average monthly charge to higher-than-average monthly charge for other games.  <br /> <br />All of the above problems aren't the result of a major cultural difference between Japanese and &quot;western&quot; designers and gamers. If it were, the philosophy behind the game would simply be DIFFERENT than what many of us might be used to. Instead, the 'casual' philosophy SE has claimed for FFXIV has been jeopardized by pointless limitations and myriad little annoyances. If you don't agree with me, please take into consideration that FFXIV is, indeed, a game - and is reliant on people ENJOYING it to succeed. If you make a game so inaccessible to players that a vast majority are unable to <i>ever</i> become immersed in your creation, you have failed. Don't be proud, SE. Don't be stubborn. Live up to the name we all thought so highly of - you're halfway there already. Just make the changes. <br /> <br />If my point isn't clear yet, the link between &quot;made for casual players&quot; and &quot;casual play&quot; is non-existent. One could argue that casual play should be something like running outside, killing 10 rats or squirrels, mining a few ore nodes and then throwing the stuff up on the retainer to sell and logging out (an event that would take about 30-45 minutes). However, this is hardly what attracts people to MMOs. In order to keep people playing, they have to feel that they are able to meet a goal within a reasonable amount of time, provided they work quickly and efficiently and don't give up when things get a little hairy or boring. Instead, when I log onto FFXIV I quickly regret having wasted so much time... since I have loads of life goals I can accomplish in the amount of time it will take me to ORGANIZE enough to start what I wanted to set out to do in FFXIV. Somewhere in the fantasyland, there is an equation which goes something like this:  <br /> <br />A [interest] x B [reward] - C [time investment] x D [tedium] = F [level of fun]. <br /> <br />FFXIV fits that equation something like this (all values are from 0[none]-10[loads], based on other MMOs comparatively):  <br /> <br />7 [interest] x 4 [reward] - 8 [time investment] x 20 [tedium] = -132 fun. <br /> <br />I want to love this game so much, but every time I play I end up asking myself &quot;why am I playing this?&quot;... an event that usually occurs after about a year of playing any MMO, if it happens at all. The desperately depressing thing is: I can see this game being loads of fun. Because of this, I'm staying until their first big update. If that addresses much of the tedium and game-components removing any fun from playing casually, then I'm in. If the update doesn't address this fundamental disconnect, I expect this game will suffer a mass exodus. <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">ok haha! lets do this. <br /> <br />First of all, why not have a AH? so you can be different? its an mmorpg its the best selling network it makes life easy! <br />I should just sell my car and ride rollerskates 10 miles to work to be different! the retainer isnt an original breakthrough its an original retarded idea. <br /> <br />and the battle system? if i wanted a work out and to mash something for hours straight id buy a bottle of viagra and go into the bathroom with a dirty mag and that would be a lot more entertaining. <br /> <br />And battle cordination? i feel like they took all the successful things from ffxi and threw them away then hired a 3 year old to develop an all new system. this game pretty much consists of 2 sh*tty dd's 4 decent dd's and 1 healer and a lot of button mashing! <br /> <br />why does it take so long to get to level 20? i don't even want to know how long it will take to get from 45-50. i wouldn't mind if the battle system was actually fun!  <br /> <br />crafting? i wouldnt mind crafting 100 items to get 1 level if it didnt take an hour to select the items from my inv then and additional hour to craft them. (the new crafting system is great, one of the only pros to this game, but speed it up, dang! <br /> <br />Wheres the notorious monsters? <br /> <br />what is the point of HQ items in this game? <br /> <br />Why limit us nerds from progressing in this game? were the ones throwing our lives away, some people get off from breasts, nerds enjoy sweet enchanted daggers and lots of HP. <br /> <br />the only difference between classes is weapons and a few selective abilities. meaning later on in the game a pug could be a healer.  <br /> <br />this game sucks and i tried so hard to like it. I waited 3 years for it too come out and saved up so much money for a pc that could run it. SE has let me down for the first time. They should refund everyones money(recall) and do a total overhaul on this game. and fire all the mentally challenged staff. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></div>

It could be a nice break from beating your head against the stones with SE, and with that nice new PC you bought to play XIV on, you can really crank the resolution up. <br /> <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">The first story quests were pretty good, though they had some minor issues. Then, when I reached rank 8 or something all of a sudden the story line left me hanging. Where do I go? What do I do now? I ranked up to level 10 only to still not find quests other than repeat guild leves that I had done earlier. <br /> <br />Like many others have mentioned, the combat system is uninspiring and slow. There isn't anything that makes it fun other than 'thrust' + 'heavy thrust' (repeat until victorious). <br /> <br />I haven't touched the game in well over a month now because of the lack of quests. I might come back to it for a little bit over the holiday break to see whats changed. I'm heavily reconsidering going back to WoW when Cataclysm is ready.</div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I think that there is confusion about the state of the game. I see a lot of statements &quot;all mmos at launch have bugs&quot; or &quot;mmos need time to get polished through patches&quot;. This is true. People are aware of it. All games launch with bugs, most noticeably mmos, which get polished over time. But, this is not a point of contention. <b>What is</b> a point of contention is <b>playability</b>.  <br /> <br />I believe FFXIV is deeply and seriously flawed on a core, fundamental level and there is no practical solution to fix it. It is a pain in the ass to play. There is so much wrong with it, far more than there is right. Let me rehash a few of those wrongs. <br /> <br /><u>UI/LAG</u>  <br />I was there for WOW launch. I was there for WAR launch. When you click on something to perform an action, you get an immediate response. In FFXIV, when you click to perform an action... <br />…  <br />… <br />… <br />… <br />… <br />… <br />… <br />… <br />… <br />well…there is this intermittent lag in between…. Casting a spell, opening a menu, crafting, whatever it is… <br />… <br />… <br />… <br />… <br />… <br />there is always that delay. And then when you have a menu-intensive game like FFXIV, where the menu is layer upon layer upon layer upon layer upon layer, well…that lag combined with all…these…layers of menu can get very annoying. I don't see a fix for this in the upcoming patch; only that the lag time will be reduced. No fix. I'll leave it to the people who are still playing to see how much of the lag is actually reduced. I have no confidence in it. Lag is not fun. <br /> <br /><u>GEAR</u> <br />A level 4 character can wear a lvl 30 gear. This is so imbalanced. And it takes away any real sense of progression and reward. In most games of this type, you work hard to get to lvl 20 and finally get to wear that lvl 20 piece of gear; or you meet the strength requirement, etc. There is no fun attaining gear. <br /> <br /><u>CRAFTING</u> <br />To really be effective, you're forced to craft. Alot. That is not fun.   <br /> <br /><u>COMBAT</u> <br />Lag plays an issue here too. No auto-attack. Combat is not fun. <br /> <br /><u>EXPLORATION</u> <br />You'll be seeing the same thing from beginning level to end level. Exploration is not fun. <br /> <br /><u>LACK OF SEAMLESS INTERACTION</u> <br />To perform an action outside of combat, you have to equip your weapon. To look at someone's bag, you character automatically stops, so if you do decide to buy something then the seller runs off, it's very inconvenient. The market system, as it is, is not fun. <br /> <br /><u>PC VS CONSOLE</u> <br />Square Enix should have coded solely for the pc. This is an mmo. At the moment, the technologies for mmo on consoles are inferior to pc. Choose your demographics. If the game is worthwhile people will buy the pc to play it. Look at all the people that upgraded their system. <br /> <br /><u>PHILOSOPHY</u> <br />Casual vs solo play. Anti-RMT measures. Forget all that. Just focus on making a fun, playable game. <br /> <br /><u>F2P</u> <br />Honestly I don't see any hope in that route. How many people would want to play a game that is not even acceptable to play when there are better alternatives out there? <br /> <br /><u>MARCH PS3</u> <br />Sorry, I don't see the game rebounding here. The backlash, the negative reviews, the players that are still playing being months ahead, will affect sales. You're not launching new servers for a new group of people but allowing people to play a world already long in process. For some people, being there at the beginning, experiencing the birth with everyone else, developing at the same time as everyone else, you can't substitute that kind of experience. Even if this weren't a significant issue, there are still the backlash and negative reviews. <br /></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I've already left.  I really tried, i had a 28 or 29 weaver, a 23 conjuror, various other crafts leveled b/w 15 and 20.  I just got sick of not having any bag space, constantly having to get naked and repair items or worse yet pay 30kk to get 75 percent durability.  Underwear wore out so fast it wasn't funny.  I was sick of spending all my time walking everywhere.  Combat wasn't fun.  It was a lag fest and I didn't even feel like i was in control of my abilities.   It was a bunch of cursing and mashing buttons and still not getting a desired result.   UI is horrible, difficult to find things on retainers.  Content seemed to be lacking, other tailors got to 38 or 39 and couldn't make anything.  It wasn't that they didn't discover recipes, it was just like nothing was put in to discover. <br /> <br />It looked great, very pretty, but an empty shell quite frankly.  I'm back playing wow and when I tell my warlock to cast this this and this and cc that run behind that rock it does it.   Yeah I was bored with wow before but I'd rather play rated battlegrounds until the xpac than waste all my time crafting in a game that may well be a sinking ship. <br /> <br />When they first extended the free trial I expected some weekly updates or quality of life.  Anima reduction, targetting fixes, inventory solutions, repair fixes would have all been little things that let me know my quality of life would get better, but nothing happened, and apparently still not much has happened and they're doing anothher free month. <br /> <br />I'll check back next summer after I've leveled my alts to 80 and am waiting for the 2nd tier of cata raiding but I just can't be bothered to waste my time or money on something that's this unfinished.  I not only bought the game, but I also installed it on mac via bootcamp and had to buy windows 7 and spent 10 hours getting it to work. <br /> <br />I cringe now when I think that ea is partnering with ankama to bring Wakfu to america.    When I first heard that was before xiv and I was thrilled, now I figure they'll bork that up to.   Dofus is a really neat game and I was looking forward to wakfu before ea got their hands on it. <br /> <br /></div>

Took me 2 hours to set up account and 5 seconds to cancel! <br /> <br />Not going to bash the game.....I was not a big online gamer until FF XI.  Never really liked any other game I tried.  I guess I was just hoping for that FF XI feeling.  On top of that all of the other issues.  Even if they fixed everything, I really miss the teamwork of FF XI and battle system.
