I use Windower so I don't lose my 2nd monitor for wiki-browsing and such, and Distance plugin to gauge distance from target, something SE obviously never wanted you to do. However, my line is drawn much closer to SE's. I don't even use Windower macros or Spellcast, let alone stuff like flee/pos-hacking. That someone thinks APRadar doesn't even count as a cheat blows my mind.</div></div>Oh noes, how horrible, i can see where i am, without having to open the map, which prevents me from doing anything else! The only real advantage it gives is death spot camping (pointless now that di and sw aren't worth camping), being able to see which vnm you're popping (NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! that saves you 1k on a powder boots charge to depop it!1!!!1). Distance gives you a bigger advantage than apradar.</div></div>Didn't you once admit to using ApRadar when soloing the ENM 'Sheep in Antlion's Clothing' or at least recommend to someone else, that was what they should do if they wanted to win?</div></div>Yep. You're right.

How dim can you be? You do realize that RMT strip mines hacked players in order to sell to idiots too stupid or lazy to make their own gil right?</div></div>There was also something weird about the huge price hike a couple of years ago when Hauby's were 10 mil+ and nobles tunics were 20 mil. :) <br />RMT harms the economy and in turn hurts the players if left unchecked.</div></div>That was mostly rmt. People were duping gil, too.</div></div>Fixed. 5 dolla per mil. I'm certain 24 hours a day RMT had a lot more to do with it than a handful of players.</div></div>Did you not read my post? DUPING GIL. It took 3 minutes to turn 1k into a billion gil.</div></div> That doesn't make any sense. If duping was so easy then RMT would not have bothered camping and farming at all. Instead of a roomful of people they'd just need one guy at a PC duping all day.</div></div>Except it did. It was a problem for rmt, because they were all banned for it. But everyone else still did it, and spread the gil around before getting banned (and of course not all were banned). Coupled with the fact that it didn't last long before it was fixed, rmt didn't all that much from it (at least not in the long term), but it destroyed the economies instantly when people spread billions of gil around in a matter of minutes. <br /> <br />For those that weren't around then, or never heard: If you opened up your dbox, put your modem on standby, and attempted to take anything out of your dbox, you would get the gil every time you attempted to take it, and it'd still stay in your dbox allowing you to take it repeatedly. You simply needed to reconnect before you fully dc'd, at which point you'd get all the gil/items, and it'd be removed from your dbox, and then you would run back to the dbox npc, and send all your gil to yourself again, and repeat a few times until you had max gil (which obviously didn't take long). <br /> <br />And there was also the subligars, which didn't help either. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  2nd 2010  9:47pm by ThePsychoticOne </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><s><a href="HTTP://ffxiah.com/player.php?id=1580273#item-sets" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxiah.com/player.php?id=1580273#item-sets">Rog</a></s> <a href="HTTP://ffxirog.livejournal.com" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxirog.livejournal.com">lolLJ</a> <a href="HTTP://myanimelist.net/animelist/thepsychoticone" rel="external nofollow" title="myanimelist.net/animelist/thepsychoticone">Anime!</a> <br /><span class="sm"><s>75RDMBLMBRDNINRNG72(oc)DRK</s> <br /><a href="HTTP://www.ffxiah.com/player/Quetzalcoatl/Ahou#item-sets" rel="external nofollow" title="www.ffxiah.com/player/Quetzalcoatl/Ahou#item-sets">ROUND2</a>:90RDMBLM85WAR75CORSMN</span><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Kerberoz wrote:</div><div class="orig"><span class="sm">If you constantly defend sh*t gear and whine incessantly about elitists, you are guaranteed to have neither skill nor gear.</span></div></div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">rale wrote:</div><div class="orig"><span class="sm">#1... for number of times your posts have been reported by other people.</span></div></div></div></div>

Oh I am sorry Judge I was speeding 100MPH so I can get to the cinema and not be late. <br /> <br />Frankly I would love it if SE was reading this and just went *BAN* on your account, I know its not going to happen.  Frankly I wouldnt shed a drop of sympathy, there is no excuse for it.  Penaltys in the game exist for a reason, the instant travel isnt too easy because it usually costs something or requires that extra 2 minutes.  SE has done us a favour in making things much easier for travel.  Your still an ass hat for it and there is no excuse.  Its exactly why some HNM shells are hated for it and people like you, you are NOT a great player just some one who has a tool that others dont.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/620816.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

The effort we spent to achieve what we have in this game is cheapened, and let's be honest, games like this are all about your accomplishments. Everyone loves walking around in their shiny new equipment as soon as they get it. If it's easier for one person to get that equipment then another, just because one of the two is using a PL bot to reach some goal sooner, then how is that fair?<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><span style="color:Aliceblue"><b>Pergatory</b> (Asura, Kupo LS)</span> <b><span style="color:Lightyellow"><span class="sm">WHM</span>80</span> ~ <span style="color:Lavender"><span class="sm">SMN</span>80</span> ~ <span style="color:Lightsteelblue"><span class="sm">DRK</span>80</span></b> <br /><span class="sm"><span style="color:Silver">&quot;If you want to know me, look inside your heart.&quot; -Lao Tzu</span></span></div></div>

I used to use Windower also and, near the end of my stay, ApRadar also. Even without the plugins, some of the features of Windower allow for things that grant an unfair advantage over PS2 and 360 users. //fillmode being one that sticks out to me since it allows you target things through walls. Even regular windower allows the use of limitless length text file macros for swapping whole sets of gear or casting spells in a really long repeated way.   <br /> <br />Like it or not the only people who aren't cheating according to the ToS are the ones who are on the consoles and aren't using turbo remotes for Provoke macros or the seemingly rare vanilla PC player.

I'd imagine Pergatory uses windower macros.  Just think about the console player that has to hit 2-3 macros just to switch out all gear in a swap.  You're cheating too.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?163335" title="http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?163335" rel="external">http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?163335</a></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">This is disgusting the amount of cheaters/people who support cheating. Did I end up off Allakhazam and on BG or KI? Since when were scumbag botters acceptable players? When did whiners saying Windower is cheating become not considered retarded? Comparing Windower to botting is as old as FFXI and as stupid an argument as possible. <br />Sure, some of the add-ons offer a small advantage (OH NOES people hit 1 button not 2!) but botting allows you to LEAVE THE COMPUTER and let a program DO EVERYTHING. People say afk'ers who go to sleep mid-Abyssea are bad, yet people who set a bot and go to sleep are alright? Neither are earning a single thing. <br /> <br />No, exp is not the most fun thing in the world but it is 99% of the game. If you hate grinding, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU! You can come out with that idiot &quot;I'll play what I want na na na&quot; baby garbage but the fact remains, if you bot, you are WORSE than RMT because at least they have a purpose. Your cheating is just due to your lazy, impatient, worthlessness. <br /> <br />Keep coming up with justifications and excuses, the fact remains you are scum if you bot/flee hack. Makes people wonder what else you cut corners in because you obviously have no respect for a signed agreement or the integrity of the game. <br /> <br />Disgusting.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?199821" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?199821">Blue TP</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?199793" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?199793">Monk TP</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?199791" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?199791">Sam TP</a> <br /><a href="HTTP://ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?199858" rel="external" title="ffxi.allakhazam.com/profile.xml?199858">War TP</a> <br />~ <br />MP 4/8 ~ <b>Blue Magic 8/8 ~ Crit 4/4 ~ Interrupt 4/4 <br />H2H 8/8 ~ SWD 8/8 ~ GKT <s>8/8</s> 4/4 <br />SAM 30/30 - 42/42 ~ MNK 30/30 - 42/42 <br />BLU 30/30 - 42/42 WAR 30/30 - 42/42</b> <br />Blue Magic Spells ~ 91/135</div></div>

Go ahead, I'm curious. All I did was say he's cheating whether he admits it or not. He was the one saying he wasn't cheating when he was. I volunteered that I was cheating: <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Pergatory wrote:</div><div class="orig">I'll be the first to admit I'm no different.

That's beside the point, though. According to SE rules by the book, I'm willing to bet every single non-console-user is a cheater. <br /> <br />Nowhere in any of my arguments have I claimed that I wasn't a cheater, or that I was somehow &quot;less&quot; of a cheater than anyone else. I'm more interested in exploring how people justify such behavior to themselves than pointing my finger and saying &quot;that person right there, he's a dirty cheater!&quot; That so many people read such thoughts into my words tells me what is on their own minds... in fact I think it's more likely that you are describing yourself than describing me. <br /> <br />I've long since come to terms with the fact that I'm a cheater for using Distance plugin. I can't imagine living without it as a WHM. Does my own justification of using Distance plugin justify other cheats as well? Not by a long shot. All cheats are not created equally. I believe there are cheats that are more harmful than others. Like I said in my original post, I've drawn my line in the sand. There are very few cheats I view as victimless, even if many have no direct victims. Does that make them wrong? Yes. Does it give me the right to criticize? I already told you I'm a cheater, so not really. I am, however, free to express my views on this forum along with yourself and everyone else. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  3rd 2010 10:53am by Pergatory </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><span style="color:Aliceblue"><b>Pergatory</b> (Asura, Kupo LS)</span> <b><span style="color:Lightyellow"><span class="sm">WHM</span>80</span> ~ <span style="color:Lavender"><span class="sm">SMN</span>80</span> ~ <span style="color:Lightsteelblue"><span class="sm">DRK</span>80</span></b> <br /><span class="sm"><span style="color:Silver">&quot;If you want to know me, look inside your heart.&quot; -Lao Tzu</span></span></div></div>

It might be a stupid idea if you don't have a clear view of the intersection and know nobody is coming, or you could get in trouble for it if you get caught, but at the end of the day, the act of driving through a red light truly is a victimless crime (and it's not even classified as a crime in most U.S. jurisdictions, in most cases it's a &quot;moving violation&quot; or &quot;administrative violation&quot; so the state doesn't have to hold a full criminal trial for every ticket).<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><b>Aliekber <br /><span class="sm"><span style="color:red">RDM</span> BLU SCH DRG PLD <br /><span style="color:darkgray">Linkshell:</span> CrimsonMercenary <span style="color:darkgray">Server:</span> Gilgamesh</b></span> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Professor Pachichachi wrote:</div><div class="orig">Eating babies was plan B.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Like Perg, I am also a PC user that uses Windower but doesn't use Spellcast/Windower macros.  I didn't think there were many others like me!  When I need to swap more than 5-6 pieces of gear at a time, I put a line to switch to Macro Book 2.  At the end of the macro in Book 2, I put a line to switch me back to Macro Book 1.  Old-school style yo! <br /> <br />Anyway, this argument is really sort of fruitless in my opinion.  Everyone has a certain level of &quot;cheating&quot; that they are comfortable with, and the line is drawn in the sand differently for each person.  You are never going to convince anyone that you are right when you are essentially impinging your OWN sense of &quot;purity&quot; of gameplay on others.  And I think the player community as a whole is comfortable with certain accepted methods of &quot;cheating&quot; (windower) but not comfortable with others (claimbot) because of the degree to which these methods affirmatively harm others' gameplay.  Hell, some people consider looking at Wiki to be &quot;cheating.&quot;  Where do you draw the line?  The answer is, you can't for anybody else EXCEPT yourself. <br /> <br />I originally downloaded Windower because I quite literally NEEDED to do certain things on my PC while playing FFXI.  The basic Windower package comes with stuff like Distance and Recast already plugged in, and at the time I downloaded Windower I didn't even realize there were things I could manually remove.  So I started using stuff like Distance and Recast.  As a career WHM + SMN, I came to rely so heavily on those plug-ins I can't imagine letting them go now.  Indeed, a &quot;recast&quot; function is indirectly implemented in modern MMO's like FFXIV, which give you a visible indication of when the cooldown for a command is up (usually by meter or coloring-in a black-and-white used icon).  So I've come to believe that it is something SE wished they could have had for FFXI but perhaps couldn't achieve because of &quot;PS2 Limitations!&quot; <br /> <br />Is that a faulty assumption?  Perhaps.  But I've drawn the line for myself at a certain place in the sand, and since I'm not hurting anybody else by my &quot;cheating&quot; then I can sleep at night. :) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  3rd 2010  5:28pm by Polltergeist </span></i></div>

Hardly effecting anyone unless you really hate people using computers for what they are- a multi-tasking tool. <br /> <br />Lengthening macros, your draw distance, or a distance plug in?  Ok, now someone can take superior screen shots vs you (oh NOES!), a person saves them self the trouble of making more than one macro button (with the newer addition to macros of /macro set, you can do a partial fix towards this, but lets face it I believe the G15 keyboards and similar can do this WITHOUT the aid of Windower ;p) so it honestly does not effect others or give a tremendous advantage to people, and distance telling plug ins, ok you're basically giving a plug in so a person doesn't have to look to the lower left of their screen and guesstimate the distance, whoopty do I'm sure somewhere out there a ranger cut themself knowing he is at a disadvantage for being on a console BECAUSE of this.   <br /> <br /> <br />When you start getting into things like Apradar and like, now you are starting to get into a more personal area.  Now you can watch for things you normally cannot see, tell when a NM is probably up due to the dead-point disappearing off of apradar, and the like.  Ok, now we're getting into a true unfair advantage which can start causing issues.  Do I believe these ones is where bannables should start coming in?  Yes, because this is where it IS offering an unfair advantage.  However, I will NOT classify something like this to say, a fleetool. <br /> <br />Fleetools start offering a larger unfair advantage, offering a faster speed which can prove unfair advantage on things such as NMs with larger spawning areas (First that comes to mind is things with a range like VE- not saying it is cheat worthy but gives an idea of how this can give a marginal advantage to someone cheating vs not).  I view this as worse than AP Radar simply because of the fact you are pretty much hacking your char to act in a way it is not suppose to naturally. <br /> <br />Bots is where it crosses its line on &quot;Ban'em all sort'em out later&quot;.  While unattended (Think the bard macros back during campaign days and fishbots)I view as worse than attended (your pl bots), I don't even slap all of these in the same bracket.  For one, I view a PL bot not even close to being as bad as a claim bot or worse, a bot that can cause some sort of inflation to economy (Such as fishbots).  Hell, I don't even put teleport bots as bad as voke bots. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, to just blanket cheating as cheating, I'm sorry to say but that's just idiotic.  Yes it is all bad, yes it is a bit hypocritical, but as I said earlier, you're basically, <b><u>for lack of better but similar examples</u></b>, throwing a person breaking the speed limit in the same group as a serial murderer.  Oh noes!  He went 5mph faster, surely his opinion is meaningless as he tries to talk logically on the one who killed a bunch of people! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />/rant <br /> <br />Tl;dr version- <br />Stop being a douche that categorizes minor infractions with major. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />edit: <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Anyway, this argument is really sort of fruitless in my opinion.  Everyone has a certain level of &quot;cheating&quot; that they are comfortable with, and the line is drawn in the sand differently for each person.  You are never going to convince anyone that you are right when you are essentially impinging your OWN sense of &quot;purity&quot; of gameplay on others.  And I think the player community as a whole is comfortable with certain accepted methods of &quot;cheating&quot; (windower) but not comfortable with others (claimbot) because of the degree to which these methods affirmatively harm others' gameplay.  Hell, some people consider looking at Wiki to be &quot;cheating.&quot;  Where do you draw the line?  The answer is, you can't for anybody else EXCEPT yourself.</div></div> <br /> <br /> <br />The problem with that is TOS and COC were never meant to be a full blown guide on how ANY company actually designates severity and punishments, however, I am sure (or at least hope) that most companies have some sort of more in-depth version that works things on a scale of severity.  Hell, its already obvious they more than likely weigh punishments by how much a person sticks out in the crowd (IE: Relics, full crafts, etc) plus infraction = how bad they will get punished- look back at the old ban spree for salvage duping.  Most the people that were banned no question asked either had max crafts on multiple characters, relics, or both.  They also seemed to go by linkshell holders being punished more sometimes as well.  That may just be coincidence on how they chose those bans, but it is obvious they do have some sort of system on how they weigh the crimes vs punishment other than just random (Most people I saw getting away with it were your everyday player and most punished with some sorta ban seemed to follow the above pattern) <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  3rd 2010  5:37pm by PyroElf </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Pyroelf, Sp34r M4st4 of Leafcull (AC), Samurai gimp of Midgardsormr. <br /> <br />[ffxisig]83246[/ffxisig] <br /> <br />...always with my kawaii Ami-chan, and Married as of 8/27/05 to her ^.^</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I have never heard of anyone getting banned for using Windower.  I have heard of people banned for using position hacks and claim bots (or for just talking about how to use such tools).  I'm not saying using Windower isn't gaining some advantage, but its been around a LONG time and SE hasn't done anything about it except give us a wonky alternative method to running the game windowed.  I don't think they approve, but I also don't think they are that worried about it.  RMT and fish bots seem higher on the priority list, along with egregious violations like Salvage duping.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="HTTP://www.ffxiah.com/player.php?id=1737819" rel="external nofollow" title="www.ffxiah.com/player.php?id=1737819">Jacs of Leviathan</a> <br />SAM, MNK, 90 THF 85 <br />Woodworking 99+3, Synergy 55 <br /> <br /><a href="HTTP://remnantls.forumotion.com" rel="external nofollow" title="remnantls.forumotion.com">Limbus LS</a></div></div>

But everyone else still did it, and spread the gil around before getting banned (and of course not all were banned).

You simply needed to reconnect before you fully dc'd, at which point you'd get all the gil/items, and it'd be removed from your dbox, and then you would run back to the dbox npc, and send all your gil to yourself again, and repeat a few times until you had max gil (which obviously didn't take long). <br /> <br />And there was also the subligars, which didn't help either. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  2nd 2010  9:47pm by ThePsychoticOne </span></i></div></div> <br /> <br /> Still not sure I believe it because that would basically mean the delivery box was client side. I know SE's programmers suck that that's a pretty unbelievable mistake.  <br /> <br /> The only dupe trick I remember was the rollback bug. Occasionally when you DCed it would roll you back to where you first entered the zone you were in, and if you traded at item or gil to someone before this happened they would have the item/gil, and you would get the item/gil back when you logged on back where you fist zoned in. This would happen seemingly at random (I remember loosing a level once because of it) but apparently some people figured out the exact circumstances that caused it to happen and could trigger a DC and rollback at will. <br /> <br /> Everyone knew about it because it was a random bug that affected everyone. But the people who figured out how to do it kept it a well guarded secret. (not that I would have done it, I preferred to not get banned) <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  3rd 2010  8:52pm by Lobivopis </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>When a guitar solo is truly awesome the guitar will burst into flame and shoot sparks.

It took 3 minutes to turn 1k into a billion gil.</div></div> That doesn't make any sense. If duping was so easy then RMT would not have bothered camping and farming at all. Instead of a roomful of people they'd just need one guy at a PC duping all day.</div></div>Except it did. It was a problem for rmt, because they were all banned for it. But everyone else still did it, and spread the gil around before getting banned (and of course not all were banned). Coupled with the fact that it didn't last long before it was fixed, rmt didn't all that much from it (at least not in the long term), but it destroyed the economies instantly when people spread billions of gil around in a matter of minutes. <br /> <br />For those that weren't around then, or never heard: If you opened up your dbox, put your modem on standby, and attempted to take anything out of your dbox, you would get the gil every time you attempted to take it, and it'd still stay in your dbox allowing you to take it repeatedly. You simply needed to reconnect before you fully dc'd, at which point you'd get all the gil/items, and it'd be removed from your dbox, and then you would run back to the dbox npc, and send all your gil to yourself again, and repeat a few times until you had max gil (which obviously didn't take long). <br /> <br />And there was also the subligars, which didn't help either.</div></div> Still not sure I believe it because that would basically mean the delivery box was client side. I know SE's programmers suck that that's a pretty unbelievable mistake. </div></div>Believe it or not, that's what happened. I don't know exactly how/why it worked, but it absolutely did work.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><s><a href="HTTP://ffxiah.com/player.php?id=1580273#item-sets" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxiah.com/player.php?id=1580273#item-sets">Rog</a></s> <a href="HTTP://ffxirog.livejournal.com" rel="external nofollow" title="ffxirog.livejournal.com">lolLJ</a> <a href="HTTP://myanimelist.net/animelist/thepsychoticone" rel="external nofollow" title="myanimelist.net/animelist/thepsychoticone">Anime!</a> <br /><span class="sm"><s>75RDMBLMBRDNINRNG72(oc)DRK</s> <br /><a href="HTTP://www.ffxiah.com/player/Quetzalcoatl/Ahou#item-sets" rel="external nofollow" title="www.ffxiah.com/player/Quetzalcoatl/Ahou#item-sets">ROUND2</a>:90RDMBLM85WAR75CORSMN</span><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Kerberoz wrote:</div><div class="orig"><span class="sm">If you constantly defend sh*t gear and whine incessantly about elitists, you are guaranteed to have neither skill nor gear.</span></div></div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">rale wrote:</div><div class="orig"><span class="sm">#1... for number of times your posts have been reported by other people.</span></div></div></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Kudos to Pyroelf on not putting up w/ moral-relativism <br /> <br />There certainly are degrees to cheeting and they affect players differently. <br /> <br />I use windower, and a occasionally apradar. <br /> <br />I first got windower because I wanted to use the microsoft IME for Japanese text in game. windower was the way to do it. I also wanted to be able to switch to web page. Then I discovered the wonderful little things like recast, infobar, and distance, and fun things like plasticsurgeon.  <br /> <br />These made a huge difference in my gameplay. First and foremost it helped me save time. As a mid/high level bst, now I didn't stop everytime I met a new mob in a new zone to look them up on wiki. I was getting the same meaningful information (level, aggressiveness, drops, etc) but I wasn't taking 2~3 min breaks everytime to do this.  <br /> <br />Distance also helped me actually make better judgments for avoiding aggro, which is a big deal for a soloing bst in the middle of nowhere. Its also fantastic for gauging charm, and casting ofcourse.  <br /> <br />Eventually my Charm set got large enough that a single macro wasn't enough, and I couldn't get enough macros to be efficient. As a primary soloer, you are responsible for every task, and speed == life == exp. (once you get around level 60ish a single death means goodbye to the last hour or 2 of exp). <br /> <br />Alas, I discovered my savior!! spellcast!!!  Primarily, I could swap my entire charm set and cast spells by typing, more efficiently than macros.  <br /> <br />I've been too lazy to develop more sophisticated Spellcast scripts. This use has fulfilled my needs. <br /> <br />Finally, when I started getting into Sky/Sea and ls level activities I was recommended Apradar. For NM claims? not at all. Just to have a useful map. <br /> <br />My point in reviewing each of these 'cheats' is to point out the deficiencies in the User Interface of FFXI. <br /> <br />Sure, they are cheats, they offer some small advantages. However, each advantage I&quot;ve listed does not, in any significant way, have a negative impact on other players. FFXI is wonderfully designed around cooperation. Certainly there are high level prizes that spark alot of competition also, but the game design Certainly favors cooperation more. This is why the advantages offered by the apps I've listed do more to help all players (myself and others) than to hurt any.  <br />Being able to judge most efficient distance to avoid aggro and use needed ability to heal player, linkless pull mob, etc just helps me be a better player. There is not enough competition for this to have significant detrimental impact to any other players. FFXI is punishing enough that small mistakes can screw you over for hours. (My favorite example being the only whm got aggro on floor 4 of promy, no one else could raise, it took 2 hours to get everyone organized and this far, and now we have to go back to beginning (pre level cap removal)) <br /> <br />These applications counter the deficiencies in the user interface. the minimap in this game is poor. I think the FFXIV minimap is almost what it should be. the FFXI minimap is almost worthless.  <br /> <br />There should also be an in game database that you can see when checking mobs that you have already examined/fought/researched. (windower - infobar), Draw Distance could be indicated in the UI after some experience w/ each spell or mob also. Recast times should be shown graphically, like in other games, where a timer or icon shows for each effect/ability.  <br />Milti-langauge support should have been added as the technologies became more available during the life of this game.  <br /> <br />There is a large difference between the impact of these vs bots, speed/pos hack, no clipping (although I have some sympathy for going thru other players/pets that can block your movement) <br /> <br />speed hack? really it hurts game balance/mechanics/playability if you can always outmaneuver a mob this way. <br />position hack - same thing <br /> <br />bots? they get more nefarious. a pl bot or cure bot isn't much, but that starts begging the question: what are you playing for?  Its really a response to the grindiness of the game. I think &quot;exp&quot; IS one of the most fun parts in the game. That is, working together in a party and fighting stuff and exploring the combinations of abilities and effects. However, the logistical problems and high demands for exp to level have made this more of a tedious, monotonous chore.  <br /> <br />claim bot - this is a nasty unfair advantage in a competitive part of the game.  <br /> <br />Games are fun because of the rules. Good rules make them fun, bad rules make them no fun. Its fun to see how to manipulate (NOT BREAK) those rules to your advantage. The poor and insufficient user interface in FFXI puts bad rules on the game. Which is why I am a big advocate of windower and even apradar (not for nm claiming).  <br /> <br />Is it a against the EULA, yes. but it compensates for SE's deficiencies. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov  4th 2010  3:14am by Xilk </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div>Server: Ramuh <br />90BST|86BLU <br />LS: MONSTERSINC <br /> <br />Choh Moui | Rongo-Nango | Lhu Mhakaracca | Lungo-Nango <br />           --Beastmaster Forever--</div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Cheating is something that gives some one a Unfair advantage over those who do not simple as that. <br /> <br />If your caught doing 31MPH in a 30 ZONE you will get away with it, even with speed cameras which I believe are set to 33MPH.  But if you go ahead and do 100MPH then frankly they throw the book at you. <br /> <br />Breaking the speed limit is speeding no matter what, thing is they let you off for doing that Tad bit over but will kill you for going mental.  No matter what using Windower is against the TOS but my guess is 1. Because of the plugin options you can get.  2. because its 3rd party which lets face it is risky when it comes to your login details. <br /><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div> <br /><img src="http://common.zam.com/xivsigs/620816.png" alt="Signature Image" border="0" /> <br /></div></div>

I'm on pc and obviously use windower/parser.   <br /> <br />The only thing that really stands out (like some others have said) is using your bots to make you gil (its not just RMT's that use their pos hax for mining etc - i wonder how much gil some of you guys have made in Mount Z?) and using bots to claim NM's.

That doesn't mean anything about the probability of it having a virus, since like i said, it applies to everything. 100k~ users, and not a single report of an account stolen because of it means that i CAN say with 100% certainty that it does not have a keylogger. <br /> <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Saying Windower is 100% safe really is stupid.

There are no viruses included in windows, and is in fact 100% safe.
