      <div class="msgContentFrame">Just a few minutes ago, I was reading my friend's Livejournal, when I came across a term I was not familiar with:  &quot;Urban Sprawl&quot; <br /> <br />I decided to <a href="HTTP://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl" rel="external nofollow" title="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl">Google it</a>, and what I found was the very definition of the area of Florida I lived in last year (where I had lived most of my life.)   <br /> <br />Before I moved to Texas, I thought it was the same everywhere as it was in Florida.  I never realized that the type of environment I was living in was recognized as a problem...  I thought the vast oceans of housing developments was normal.  I remember a long time ago how we'd have discussions about how driving was a &quot;privilege&quot;, and how impossible it seemed to me that anyone could walk anywhere and not spend three quarters of their life walking from point &quot;A&quot; to point &quot;B&quot;.   <br /> <br />It's like Purgatory...  You can walk for what seems like forever and not get anywhere... everything looks the same.  It is an anti-social environment that perpetuates feelings of hostility and hopelessness.  I could never quite explain it before.   <br /> <br />So now I am wondering if anyone else here has experienced this &quot;Urban Sprawl&quot; in the areas you live in.  I am even more curious about those who live in parts of the world that aren't plagued with this issue.   <br /> <br /><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="/forum.html?forum=22&amp;mid=128504363560106769&amp;page=1" rel="external" title="ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=22&amp;mid=128504363560106769&amp;page=1">The Minecraft Thread</a></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">People live in the environment they are raised and most never move more than twenty five miles away their whole lives. Others, have more experience and adventure and move away and experience a completely new environment. Like the attraction of the big city to people in the small towns. Or the people in the big towns (Urban sprawl) wanting to move away to the small towns. Each has it's attractions and things that turn you away. <br /> <br />I grew up in a small town, or slightly bigger than a really small town. Pretty much you knew all your neighbors and they knew you and your family. Nothing seemed private and you always felt watched by everyone. Sure, the big city was an hour away. But, it's draw was like a magnet to me. As is the desire to be in a small town is now that I'm much older.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v619/ImGatomon/Request.jpg" title="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v619/ImGatomon/Request.jpg" rel="external nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v619/ImGatomon/Request.jpg</a> <br />Iamadam the Shady wrote: <br />The karma system is working as intended. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">PaladinStargazer wrote:</div><div class="orig"> <br />For someone that claims to not care about karma you sure bring it up a lot.

      <div class="msgContentFrame">Chicago has its regular suburbs but has also expanded out into what is known as the &quot;exurbs&quot;, previous farming regions that have been developed into housing developments.  Places that used to be slang for &quot;out in the middle of nowhere&quot; now are filled with single family developments, Outback steak houses and acres of strip malls.  They're not even really &quot;Chicagoland&quot; as a trip into the city means a 90 minute drive but there isn't a stretch between your house out in the exurbs and Lake Shore Drive that isn't developed in some way.  Around here, the major industry in them seems to be freight hubs and giant distribution warehouses although sometimes you get a major company that decided to relocate its headquarters out there for cheaper land and taxes. <br /> <br />But land is cheap out there, taxes aren't so bad and you have a lower crime rate.  The community is made up of young, upwardly mobile folks so the schools aren't bad and you have easy access to chain preschools and Chuck E. Cheese's.  All those housing developments come with their own parks and playgrounds.  A trip to the Museum of Science &amp; Industry or Brookfield Zoo is over an hour each way but you only go once a year anyway.  95% of the restaurants are chains but you're not taking your five year old and your two year old to that French-Vietnamese place for chicken fingers so what does it matter?  I suppose if you're looking for a quiet safe place to raise some kids and a five minute drive to the nearest TGI Fridays, it's just what you're looking for.  If not, get a loft in the city and spend your days sneering at the poor souls in the the purgatory of Oswego, IL.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><span class="sm">R.I.P.

Places that used to be slang for &quot;out in the middle of nowhere&quot; now are filled with single family developments, Outback steak houses and acres of strip malls.  They're not even really &quot;Chicagoland&quot; as a trip into the city means a 90 minute drive but there isn't a stretch between your house out in the exurbs and Lake Shore Drive that isn't developed in some way.  Around here, the major industry in them seems to be freight hubs and giant distribution warehouses although sometimes you get a major company that decided to relocate its headquarters out there for cheaper land and taxes. <br /> <br />But land is cheap out there, taxes aren't so bad and you have a lower crime rate.  The community is made up of young, upwardly mobile folks so the schools aren't bad and you have easy access to chain preschools and Chuck E. Cheese's.  All those housing developments come with their own parks and playgrounds.  A trip to the Museum of Science &amp; Industry or Brookfield Zoo is over an hour each way but you only go once a year anyway.  95% of the restaurants are chains but you're not taking your five year old and your two year old to that French-Vietnamese place for chicken fingers so what does it matter?  I suppose if you're looking for a quiet safe place to raise some kids and a five minute drive to the nearest TGI Fridays, it's just what you're looking for.  If not, get a loft in the city and spend your days sneering at the poor souls in the the purgatory of Oswego, IL.</div></div> <br />I once went to a bonfire at somebody's house in Oswego, way back in highschool.  Even then, my first impression upon driving through &quot;downtown&quot; Oswego was, &quot;That's bloody all?&quot; <br /> <br />Now that I'm in the city, I will never move back to the 'burbs until the double-headed monster of wife and children compel me.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><span class="sm">So here I am, <br />Growing older all the time, <br />Looking older all the time, <br />Feeling younger in my mind...</span></div></div>

I never realized that the type of environment I was living in was recognized as a problem...</div></div> <br /> <br />It's mostly &quot;recognized&quot; as a problem by centralized social planners who don't like the fact that most people who have the financial resources to choose will tend to reject their wonderfully planned urban environments in favor of suburban living. So they come up with some pretty tortured reasons why this is &quot;bad&quot;. Reading that wiki article was pretty amusing. Pretty much the entire list of negatives resolve down to two things: &quot;Cars are bad!&quot; and &quot;We want wealthy people to stay living in close proximity with the poor people so we can more easily take their money&quot;. <br /> <br /> <br />That's pretty much it. Obviously, there are badly planned suburbs, but there are also some incredibly poorly planned urban neighborhoods (and arguably a hell of a lot more of them). Overall though, suburbs are quieter, have less crime, are healthier for those living there (they do an interesting twist on the &quot;health effects&quot; in the article btw), and despite the greater dependence on automobiles often result in a shorter total travel time to/from work. Some people hate the suburbs, some people love them. But I guess my point is that you can list off academic reasons why they are &quot;bad&quot; all day long, but it doesn't change the fact that an increasing number of people chose to live there if they have the choice available to make. <br /><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

And those who choose to live there pay extra for those services. Their homes cost more on average because the developer had to build that infrastructure as well as the homes (on top of the lower density issue). They often also pay additional taxes of one sort or another to pay for the schools, fire, and police in the area. The point is that from a cost perspective, those areas are far more likely to be a net gain for a municipality than a net loss. <br /> <br />The reason the cost efficiency issue is brought up is that there are some who'd much rather that the extra money the more affluent would spend living in the suburbs be spent offsetting the costs of services for the poorer citizens. If you can keep everyone living in high density areas, you can massively jack up the cost for the expensive homes (with less attendant costs for services), which in turn provides significantly increased taxes that the same area can then use to provide services to communities which don't bring in enough revenue to cover costs. <br /> <br /> <br />It has nothing to do with the efficiency or quality of life in the suburbs, but with a belief that it's somehow wrong for people to spend their own money making their own lives better.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

Paying for the privilege of being inefficient doesn't change the fact that you are, in fact, being inefficient.  The biggest issue with it really (in my estimation) is that the tax base in those regions is fairly fragile and it doesn't take much before the town can't afford that inefficient water system or garbage pickup or emergency services or public schools.  One shutdown of a major employer or shift in the housing market and the town is forced to jack up taxes to try and compensate and the whole thing starts to come apart (as witnessed in various regions). <br /> <br />Your rush to climb the cross of &quot;They just hate wealth!&quot; aside, there's legitimate things to point out about that sort of sprawl.  They don't all feed into your desperate need to cry about how mean everyone else is to the rich.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><span class="sm">R.I.P.

By that argument we should shut down all movie theaters because it's more efficient for people to rent the DVDs instead. One can argue that almost all of the things we actually strive for in life are &quot;inefficient&quot;. I for one don't want to live in a world where my actions are ruled by what is most efficient for the whole. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Paying for the privilege of being inefficient doesn't change the fact that you are, in fact, being inefficient.</div></div> <br /> <br />Yes. Congratulations! What's your point? That people with more money tend to prefer to live on larger plots of land with more room between them and their neighbors, less noise, and less crime and that they are willing to pay more for that? That's not a &quot;problem&quot; to be solved Joph. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">The biggest issue with it really (in my estimation) is that the tax base in those regions is fairly fragile and it doesn't take much before the town can't afford that inefficient water system or garbage pickup or emergency services or public schools.  One shutdown of a major employer or shift in the housing market and the town is forced to jack up taxes to try and compensate and the whole thing starts to come apart (as witnessed in various regions).</div></div> <br /> <br />And? It's not the town paying for it. It's the people living there. This is something liberals seem to always have a mental block about. It's not your money. It's not the government's money. It's ultimately not your choice either. If people move out of an area, it's usually because the government did something stupid which made their lives not worth living there. The solution should be to *not* do those stupid things, yet the typical liberal response is to try to make it so that people don't have a choice about where or how they live. Make everyplace just as awful as the inner city and everyone will have to live there. <br /> <br />Brilliant solution! <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Your rush to climb the cross of &quot;They just hate wealth!&quot; aside, there's legitimate things to point out about that sort of sprawl.

The whole efficiency angle is a symptom of this. Liberals think it's their money, but it's not. It's the people's money and they ought to be able to choose to spend it to improve their own lives. When you take that away, you take away their freedom and whatnot.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

What do you think you're saying when you talk about the &quot;efficiency&quot; of having people live in one build pattern instead of another? Aren't you exerting &quot;control&quot; over people if you support zoning restrictions based on said criteria? How can it be a conspiracy theory to point this out? <br /> <br />Even if we're just talking about the &quot;control&quot; of getting people to live in different areas, not because it's where they would choose to live, but because it's more &quot;efficient&quot; for those running things, it's still a form of control, isn't it? I could also talk about the pressures in such &quot;efficient&quot; environments that just happen to push people away from cars and to public transportation, and which encourage them to adopt and support more stringent restrictions regarding action within the community (anti-smoking, noise regulations, pets, etc). Those forms of control just happen by themselves, but they still do happen, right? Is it wrong to point out that people living in the suburbs are less restricted than those living in the city? I don't think so at all.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

I don't think so. Given that we already see exactly this going on already, what I'm talking about isn't a conspiracy, it's a fact. <br /> <br />Some cities do actively manage their regulation and planning in order to discourage as much as possible the development of suburban communities in favor of more centralized urban ones. And they justify it for all the same reasons Joph gave. They can provide better bus service, and utilities are cheaper, fire and police are closer, there's less need for cars, so less people will have them making for less environmental impact, etc. What is that if not an attempt to control how people live their lives? At some point, some one has decided that it is &quot;better&quot; to ride a bike than drive a car and uses city planning, zoning, and regulations to try to pressure people to abandon their cars and ride bikes, or take public transportation, or walk. <br /> <br /> <br />This is not theory, this is what goes on right now in many cities. And whether the objective is to control the population or not, that is the ultimate result. I'm just saying that I disagree with the whole concept. It's not the government's job to decide how people should live. It's the government's job to create an environment in which people can make those decisions for themselves and act on those choices to the greatest degree possible. If that means that some people choose to live in more expensive homes in neighborhoods designed to meet their needs instead of some book-smart social engineer who thinks he knows better than they do, then the government really ought to stay the hell out of the way, right? <br /> <br /> <br />But quite often, it doesn't. And the arguments Joph is parroting are the ones used in the public discourse to support said government action. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 16th 2010  7:11pm by gbaji </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

In what way does this improve the quality of life?  When your home is placed in the center of miles of other people's private homes, it is virtually the same as being stuck in the middle of nowhere.   <br /> <br />Cars aren't &quot;bad&quot;, you just shouldn't have to be so dependent on them, especially when the distance you travel to get out of the maze you live in is still a tremendous waste of time and gas.  &quot;Inefficient&quot; is a huge understatement.   <br /> <br />I guess in the end, everything boils down to money.  I read this conversation and I envision some @#%^ grinning and shaking some other @#%^'s hand as he accepts a large bag with a dollar sign drawn on it, whilst simultaneously sh*tting upon the heads of everyone else.

Interesting interpretation though. <br /> <br />It's about different views of how people should live within society. Actually to be more accurate, it's about one view which says that people should form their communities together with as little &quot;central planning&quot; as possible so as to maximize freedom, and another view that sees that as &quot;inefficient&quot; and is willing to do away with the freedom and individuality of the people in order to make things a bit more cost effective. <br /> <br />The fact that you tend to have to have money to avoid the latter groups planned urban communities isn't a function of a &quot;rich vs poor&quot; argument, but a function of the reality that poor people are more adversely affected by such things than those with wealth because they can't afford to avoid them. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Whether you represent the no money class or you're a millionaire, you aren't going to want to live in a seemingly endless ocean of housing developments are you?

When your home is placed in the center of miles of other people's private homes, it is virtually the same as being stuck in the middle of nowhere.</div></div> <br /> <br />We're arguing urban versus suburban. Are you suggesting that when you live in tenement apartment number 306, surrounded by numerous other apartments in the same building, which in turn are surrounded by numerous other similarly designed buildings all laid out in an &quot;efficient&quot; grid pattern is somehow less dehumanizing than living in a suburban neighborhood? Why? <br /> <br /> <br />And I find it interesting that you talk about how regardless of how much money someone might have they wouldn't &quot;want&quot; to live in &lt;wherever&gt;, yet one of the points I made earlier is that people who can afford to do so overwhelmingly <i>choose</i> to live in the suburbs. So you're wrong about either your description of the suburbs themselves, or about people wanting to live there, or perhaps even both. <br /> <br />At the end of the day, choice matters, right? People overwhelmingly live in close packed &quot;efficient&quot; urban communities when they don't have a choice. When given a choice, they tend to move to suburban styled communities instead. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Cars aren't &quot;bad&quot;, you just shouldn't have to be so dependent on them, especially when the distance you travel to get out of the maze you live in is still a tremendous waste of time and gas.  &quot;Inefficient&quot; is a huge understatement.</div></div> <br /> <br />The flip side of dependency on cars is not having a car and the freedom it represents though. You are trading a dependency on a personal vehicle with dependency on public transportation and government provided services. How'd that work out for the folks in New Orleans? <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 17th 2010  4:54pm by gbaji </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

But the link in the OP to the wikipage about &quot;urban sprawl&quot; was pretty specifically critical of the very concept of &quot;suburbs&quot;, period. I commented that while said wiki page seemed to go on an on talking about this aspect and that, pretty much the entire list of negatives rested on already not liking cars and not liking the idea that people with more money can move to them, thus reducing the amount of funds which can be focused in more urban grid-style communities. <br /> <br />Seriously. Read the wiki and tell me if you think I'm wrong about my assessment. <br /> <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">The problem here is when they make massive plots of land into suburbs, with <b>nothing else.</b>  Where you can drive or walk or ride a goddam bus for hours on end and find nothing but cookie-cutter houses with maybe a 7-11 store or a Walmart/shopping center thrown in once in a while.  </div></div> <br /> <br />Um... That's the design of &quot;the suburbs&quot;. The whole point is to separate the places where people live with the stores they shop in and the places they work at. Now, obviously having 20 mile square areas with nothing but suburbs can be problematic, but that's not an issue with the layout of the suburbs themselves, but with poor zoning of suburbs and commercial/business areas within the city itself. <br /> <br /> <br />If you think that the layout itself is &quot;wrong&quot;, then you are indeed just criticizing suburbs. And frankly, I think that most people's disagreements with them are based on hearing other people list off problems but not really thinking it through. The benefits typically far outweigh the negatives. Yes, they are designed with cars in mind, but once you get past that (and I know that some people just can't), the design an layout of most suburban communities is quite intelligent. Traffic flow is typically vastly better even though more people own and drive cars. It actually takes less time to move through them (again as long as you're driving). Try to drive 5 miles down a main street in a grid-based urban community. Then drive 5 miles down a main street in a suburban community. It's massively faster in the suburbs. The design means that there are fewer cross streets on the main streets. Main streets also do not have shops lining them, thus reducing the stop and go aspect of travel. Instead, shops are focused at large corner malls. Even though the residents have to wind through a few streets to get to the main streets, those smaller streets have little traffic on them. The main streets have nothing for anyone to stop at between intersections meaning faster flow. The replacement of a grid with fewer side streets leading to a &quot;cluster&quot; of small streets with houses on them mean that there are fewer total traffic lights as well. <br /> <br /> <br />The advantage of the suburbs is that while there is less stuff right near you, you also aren't tied heavily to the stuff that's right near you. It's much easier to get in and out of suburban neighborhoods. It's a fast trip to the closest freeway, while the same distance in a grid layout might take 5-10 times longer. This means that people in grid neighborhoods tend to become dependent on the shops near them and dependent on public transportation to get anywhere else. It's a major hassle for them to leave their little communities, so they avoid it if they can. Which, as long as there are enough jobs in the area, works great. The reality though is that in most urban areas, the shops nearby are not even close to enough to hire all the people living in the area (and we can't all just work in stores selling stuff to ourselves, for reasons which should be obvious). Thus, people have to leave to work elsewhere anyway, meaning either owning a car (which is a pain when you live in those kinds of neighborhoods), or public transportation. This means longer commutes, not shorter. <br /> <br />I know people who commute from freaking Temecula into Northern San Diego and their commute takes similar time to that of a friend of mine who used to live right off the 163 freeway (Washington area, right next to downtown) while commuting down to the community theater he manages. It's literally a straight shot down 2nd street, and is maybe about 3 or 4 miles. But it could take him easily 30-40 minutes to get there due entirely to the incredibly poor traffic flow of the area he lived in. He still works at the same theater, but now lives in El Cajon (that's about 10 miles further away as the crow flies, almost on the other side of the county. It takes him about the same time to commute. Why? Because it's faster to funnel onto a freeway, travel downtown and get to where he works, than it is to creep along a main street through a handful of urban neighborhoods. Vastly faster. <br /> <br /> <br />BTW, that's why I kept putting the word efficiency in quotes when Joph used it. I don't agree with the criteria being used to derive that assumption. Sure, maybe it costs more to lay pipes and electricity into suburbs, but IMO that's vastly outweighed by other factors.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

I have a more efficient cost to gain ratio, while you have a more efficient spending to time ratio. <br /> <br />If we disagree about what to measure, then the word efficiency all by itself is somewhat meaningless, right? <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">The example you just used was that a guy has a longer commute, but it takes him just as long. This is not more efficient. I'm not even sure you know what the word means. I'm going to assume your example was meant to show how driving further every day is more &quot;efficient&quot;. </div></div> <br /> <br />See? Measuring different things. I'm measuring the time it takes to travel X distance. Call it a &quot;commute efficiency&quot;. If it takes you 30 minutes to travel 5 miles on your commute, and it takes me 30 minutes to travel 20 miles on mine, then my commute is more efficient in that sense, isn't it? And in fact, I'm likely using less gas on that commute as well. Of course, maybe you are riding on a bus, but you get the point. <br /> <br /> <br />You have chosen to somewhat arbitrarily decide that the distance of the commute is what matters, but I think most people would argue that it's about the time of the commute. The larger point being that much of the complaint about the suburbs is that you are farther away from things, so it takes longer to get anywhere. My example was intended to counter that. While you may be further out when living in the suburbs, due to superior traffic flow it often takes the same amount of actual time to get places. Thus, the &quot;other factors&quot; really matter more, but were given scant notice in the wiki while a huge focus was on the dependence on cars.<div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

I assume you meant &quot;minimizes its resource consumption&quot;, cause otherwise that just makes no sense at all. <br /> <br />But that's not true either. For something to be efficient, you have to compare two things: Cost versus reward. It's not just about minimizing costs. I could spend $40 on a steak dinner, or $5 on a piece of candy. One of those costs less but no one would say it was more efficient. Efficiency is measured by comparing the cost/effort of doing something, with the relative gain from that cost. <br /> <br />You'd have to say that it minimizes the resource consumption relative to the things those resources provide. Which is a valid argument (and the one Joph brought up). However, it assumes that the only cost  is from the government and the only gain is those services. From the perspective of the people who choose to live in suburbs, they find the extra cost worth it because of the benefits. In the same way you'd be willing to pay $40 for a steak dinner but *not* $5 for a single piece of candy, those residents are relating the costs to what they get. And when they do that, they find that they prefer to live in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> <br />My point is that by the only measure of &quot;efficiency&quot; that really matters (those who are choosing where to pay to live), we have to conclude that it is more efficient to live in the suburbs. Anyone arguing otherwise must be choosing to ignore the criteria that the people who are actually choosing to pay extra to live in those areas are using to make that choice. And since they're the ones making the choice and paying the extra cost, they're right and you're wrong. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">If they're not, they're too stupid to matter, really.</div></div> <br /> <br />Sure. Other stupid things would be insisting that some social theory about what is more efficient in terms of city planning matters more than the choices made by the people who actually live in those areas. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig"><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">If it takes you 30 minutes to travel 5 miles on your commute, and it takes me 30 minutes to travel 20 miles on mine, then my commute is more efficient in that sense, isn't it?</div></div> <br /> <br />In no way is your hypothetical anecdotal commute more efficient.</div></div> <br /> <br />In terms of distance traveled over time? Amount of fuel consumed getting there (assuming both are driving similar vehicles)? I'll point out again that efficiency depends on what you are measuring. It's not an absolute. <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">I mean, you're the one making it up, even, and you didn't bother to at least make your commute take only twenty minutes? Or ten?</div></div> <br /> <br />The point of that example was to show that distance alone isn't the only factor to consider. If I have a choice between living in a high crime, high noise area with no parking for my car because it's &quot;closer&quot; to where I work, but then realize that I could live in a suburb that's four times as far away, but with less crime and less noise, and my commute will take the exact same amount of time, then the issue of distance becomes irrelevant to my decision. <br /> <br />This is a common situation when comparing urban versus suburban areas btw. It's very convenient in urban areas to get to the small shops and businesses that are within a few block radius of where you live. But anything else becomes a nightmare. You can eliminate your dependence on having a car, but unless every single thing you'll ever need is within that short distance, you either have to maintain a car anyway or take public transit. Going outside the neighborhood becomes a very time consuming thing. <br /> <br />Suburbs, on the other hand, are designed specifically to allow people to get to/from them very easily and quickly. The lack of super close things doesn't matter because it doesn't take you very long to get to other things that are farther away. The big benefit to this is that you aren't tied to just the things that are close by. It's not that much more of a hassle to hop on the freeway and head to another part of town to get to that store or restaurant that you might like to go to. Whereas the guy living in the urban community is going to tend to be &quot;stuck&quot; in that area most of the time, venturing out only when he has to. There's such a huge &quot;cost&quot; to leave the immediate area that the tendency is to adjust your livestyle to fit the things that are nearby (which is where the &quot;people control&quot; aspect of this comes in), whereas the suburban guy will simply travel to whatever/wherever he wants without giving it a second thought. <br /> <br />Call that dependence on the car, if you want. I call it freedom. <br /> <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Quote:</div><div class="orig">Even then, in the context of this thread, it's still less efficient. Freeways and bridges and tunnels and police substations and WalMarts and cookie-cutter boxes sprawling far as the eye can see don't just grow on trees, duder.</div></div> <br /> <br />I'll ask again? How are you measuring efficiency? Yes. It costs more to provide those things, but the result is better. You are confusing &quot;more cost efficient&quot; with &quot;cheaper&quot;. Those are not always going to mean the same thing. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Nov 18th 2010  4:41pm by gbaji </span></i><div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">I'm sorry. Was I suppose to read the thread and think that it was an endorsement of suburban living? WTF? I'm not allowed to disagree when someone says something I disagree with? <br /> <br />Let's hit some of the highlights from the OP and the first response: <br /> <br /><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">Kuwoobie wrote:</div><div class="orig">I never realized that the type of environment I was living in was recognized as a problem...

You can walk for what seems like forever and not get anywhere... everything looks the same.  It is an anti-social environment that perpetuates feelings of hostility and hopelessness.

I'm sorry but I think it's perfectly reasonable to respond to that OP by saying that it's *not* a problem, and the wiki source is over focused on just a couple things while ignoring other factors. And sure, I'll speculate as to *why* some people think that suburban living in a &quot;problem&quot; as well. <div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><div class="msgQuote"><div class="source">King Nobby wrote:</div><div class="orig">More words please</div></div></div></div>

      <div class="msgContentFrame">It's not &quot;just&quot; suburban living though.  In moderation it is fine, like most things.  In excess is when it becomes a problem, also like most things.  I don't necessarily agree with everything the article says, nor do I care.  From what I can tell it actually gives views from multiple angels, so obviously it's not just some &quot;let's bash suburbs&quot; article.   <br /> <br />My <b>only problem</b> here is when housing developments are allowed to cover so much land that there is literally no point in living there.  It is something I have experience first hand.  I did not just realize it was problem because somebody told me it was a problem, I have always known, I just never knew anyone else cared to say anything about it. <br /> <br />In the case of most of the landmass I have visited in Florida, it is like a massive internment camp for the elderly.  I have no real idea how I got there or why.  I grew up there, and eventually escaped.  There is nothing of value there, nothing to see, nothing to do.  There is no quality of life.  I cannot stress that enough.  I'm sure somebody somewhere made lots of money building/managing all of those houses.  Good for them.  <div class="msgSig"><div class="msgSigBar sm">----------------------------</div><a href="/forum.html?forum=22&amp;mid=128504363560106769&amp;page=1" rel="external" title="ffxi.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=22&amp;mid=128504363560106769&amp;page=1">The Minecraft Thread</a></div></div>
