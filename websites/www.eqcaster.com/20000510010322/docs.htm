<p><strong>Radius?</strong> - Maybe some sort of area effect
spell radius?</p>

<p><strong>Attrib</strong> - What attribute is being adjusted?</p>

<p><strong>Base </strong>- Base attribute setting</p>

<ul>
    <li>What is the lowest level the attribute can be adjusted is
        the most common use.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Max</strong> - Maximum attribute setting</p>

<ul>
    <li>What is the highest level the attribute can be adjusted
        is the most common use.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Calc </strong>- How does level effect the attribute
adjustment. Still some formulas to understand.</p>

spells are cast. Mainly for 'Summon Pet' to determine the pet

when the spell is cast. 'None' means unresistable.</p>

<p><strong>Res Adj</strong> - How much additional resistance is
given the receiver of the spell.</p>

<ul>
    <li>A resistance adjustment of 25 would mean that the mob
        would receive 25 extra points of resistance for a spell.
        Use this field to see if the spell that you are casting
        will be resisted often, or rarely. Some Enchanter spells
        are unresistable.</li>

pushed back. Most 'force' style spells have a push back range.</p>

<p><strong>Push Up Range </strong>- Several druid spells actually
'throw' the target into the air. I'm assuming that the larger
throw spells can cause damage if the target doesn't have a Safe
Fall ability.</p>

<p><strong>Q1?</strong> - Values 0 thru 8. Some people have
e-mailed me saying that this field describes how much light the
surrounding area received when the spell is cast. Still
investigating.</p>
