Questions</font></h1>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q) </strong><em>How do I export the spells?</em></p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> Display all the spells you want to export
by pressing the buttons on the left hand side. Now click on any
spell in the Spell Listings (grid area) and the 'File - Export'
function will be available.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q) </strong><em>The grid looks weird. Lines are going
thru all of the text information!</em></p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> You're using a bugged version of Internet
Explorer 4.0. It is also unfortuately the version released with
Windows 98. Upgrade your version of IE4.0 to any future version
and the grid will look normal.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q) </strong><em>How do you see the spells that are
different when comparing them?</em></p>

<p><strong>A) </strong>There are now two buttons labeled 'M' and
'N'. The 'M' button will show modified spells and the 'N' button
will show new spells.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q) </strong><em>How do you print a spell?</em></p>

<p><strong>A) </strong>Click on a spell in the Spell Listings
(upper grid) to display it in the lower (Spell Detail) area. Now
click on the Spell Detail area. The 'File - Print' menu option
will now be available!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q) </strong><em>I didn't download the .eff files!?
Where are they?</em></p>

<p><strong>A) </strong>Letting users download the spell files
would probably constitute a violation of copyright laws. Last
thing I want is Verant mad at me.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q)</strong> <em>How come there are no files when I
download EqCaster?<br>
</em><strong>Q) </strong><em>Where do I get the eff files?</em></p>

<p><strong>A) </strong>I do not create the spell information, but
rather decypher them directly from the EverQuest directory
itself. If EverQuest is loaded in the default directories, then
the spell files should be opened automatically. Otherwise, you
must guide EqCaster to the correct location.</p>

<p>When the 'File Open' dialog is displayed, change the current
directory to the EverQuest directory, and open up the file named <strong>spdat.eff</strong>.
The next time you run EqCaster, it will automatically load up
this file.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q)</strong> <em>Can I get banned for using this
utility?</em></p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> I do not believe so, no.</p>

<p>I am very public about my character and my server, and I have
not been banned nor warned. I have also let many people at Verant
know about this site and what my intentions are.</p>

<p>This program is very benign and does not 'packet sniff' like
ShowEq and other utilities. It only displays the current spell
data that you could get off of at least twenty other sites, but
in a more convenient off-line environment. The only purpose of
this program is to let you know specifically what effect does a
particular spell have, and some of the minor differences between
each.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q)</strong> <em>How can I see what has changed since
the last patch?</em></p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> Make sure you make a copy of <strong>spdat.eff</strong>
into a different file (such as '<strong>Jan1500.eff</strong>').
Then after a patch, load up both files in the same program and do
a 'Window-Tile' command. This will split the screen and allow
simulaneous viewing of both spell files.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q) </strong><em>How do I view all the spells</em></p>

<p><strong>A) </strong>Double click on 'All Classes' to view
every spell.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q)</strong> <em>How do I sort the fields.</em></p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> Just click on the heading of the spell
that you would like to sort. Click a second time, and the list
will be sorted in reverse. </p>

<p>The best way to sort class specific data is to click on the
'Spell Name' column, then the 'Level' column.</p>
