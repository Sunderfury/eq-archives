Questions</font></h1>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q)</strong> <em>Can I get banned for using this
utility?</em></p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> I do not believe so, no.</p>

<p>I am very public about my character and my server, and I have
not been banned nor warned. I have also let many people at Verant
know about this site and what my intentions are.</p>

<p>This program is very benign and does not 'packet sniff' like
ShowEq and other utilities. It only displays the current spell
data that you could get off of at least twenty other sites, but
in a more convenient off-line environment. The only purpose of
this program is to let you know specifically what effect does a
particular spell have, and some of the minor differences between
each.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q)</strong> <em>How can I see what has changed since
the last patch?</em></p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> Make sure you make a copy of <strong>spdat.eff</strong>
into a different file (such as '<strong>Jan1500.eff</strong>').
Then after a patch, load up both files in the same program and do
a 'Window-Tile' command. This will split the screen and allow
simulaneous viewing of both spell files.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q)</strong> <em>How come there are no files when I
download EqCaster?<br>
</em><strong>Q) </strong><em>Where do I get the eff files?</em></p>

<p><strong>A) </strong>I do not create the spell information, but
rather decypher them directly from the EverQuest directory
itself. If EverQuest is loaded in the default directories, then
the spell files should be opened automatically. Otherwise, you
must guide EqCaster to the correct location.</p>

<p>When the 'File Open' dialog is displayed, change the current
directory to the EverQuest directory, and open up the file named <strong>spdat.eff</strong>.
The next time you run EqCaster, it will automatically load up
this file.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q) </strong><em>How do I view all the spells</em></p>

<p><strong>A) </strong>Double click on 'All Classes' to view
every spell.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q)</strong> <em>How do I sort the fields.</em></p>

<p><strong>A)</strong> Just click on the heading of the spell
that you would like to sort. Click a second time, and the list
will be sorted in reverse. </p>

<p>The best way to sort class specific data is to click on the
'Spell Name' column, then the 'Level' column.</p>
