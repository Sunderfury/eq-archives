<hr>

<p>I am Vaslin Slickfinger, level 42 Scout of Tunare on Tarew
Marr. Being a sneaky rogue as I am, I was very curious about
poisons and how they worked. After many months of decyphing data,
I finally had a complete list of poisons and their effects on
creatures. But another friend of mine, Dreald the Magician, had
some more questions about his new spells, and once again, I dug
down and grabbed some magician information as well.</p>

<p>And I decided to share this information with all of Norrath!
So, for everyone that practices the fine art of the arcane, I
give you EqCaster. A wonderful little utility program that will
show you complete spell information and weapon effects for all
the spells of this land.</p>

<p>If you would like to comment on an incorrect spell, please
write me at <a href="mailto:vaslin@eqcaster.com">vaslin@eqcaster.com</a>
and I'll see what I can do. There is certainly a myriad of spells
and making sure that the data is correct is very difficult. Most
of the information must be assumed and of course, I'm only a wood
elf.</p>

<p>As an example, here is the mysterious <a
