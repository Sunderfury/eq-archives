<p>I distribute this program as FreeWare and you may use it for
as long as you would like. </p>

<p>Writing this program is taking a great amount of time, mainly
for the technical support and the number of emails that are
received every day. Plus, there is still a lot of work to be
done! Spells are changing weekly and keeping up with the
information is a major task.</p>

<p>If you use this software and find it as a valuable addition to
your knowledge of the game, please, feel free to send a small
donation of $10 for continued support of this product. If you are
a resident of Tarew Marr, a donation of platinum will also be
accepted.</p>
