<h1 align="center"><font color="#408080">Welcome to EqCaster!</font></h1>

<hr>

<p>I am Vaslin Slickfinger, level 49 Scout of Tunare on Tarew
Marr. Being a sneaky rogue as I am, I was very curious about
poisons and how they worked. After many months of decyphing data,
I finally had a complete list of poisons and their effects on
creatures. But another friend of mine, Dreald the Magician, had
some more questions about his new spells, and once again, I dug
down and grabbed some magician information as well.</p>

<p>And I decided to share this information with all of Norrath!
So, for everyone that practices the fine art of the arcane, I
give you EqCaster. A wonderful little utility program that will
show you complete spell information and weapon effects for all
the spells of this land.</p>

<hr>

<p>I also present <font color="#008080"><strong>EqOption</strong></font>!
A downloadable program that will edit your color and default
settings <strong>automatically</strong>!! </p>

<p>Version 1.3 just released!!</p>

<ul>
    <li>Four color background settings</li>
    <li>See black text or white text depending on the background,
        just like real everquest!</li>
    <li>Includes both original everquest and new default values</li>
    <li>Open/Save support lets you change just one color without
        restarting over!</li>
    <li>Smallest download of any color option editor</li>

<p>And now for the first time, I also present to you, my quest <strong>Compendium</strong>!
This is a Compiled HTML Help file that includes all of the quests
and trade skills that I have finished in the land of Norrath. And
believe me, that's a lot. The compendium now consists of nearly
1900 pages of HTML!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eqcaster.com/Compendium2/EverQuest.chm">The
Vaslin Slickfinger EverQuest Quest Compendium (size 1.9M)</a> -
Version 2.3</p>

<p>I am also taking assignments for completing quests! If you are
interested in completing a quest that I do not have finished in
the compendium or from the <a
href="http://www.eqcaster.com/quest.htm">following list</a>, I
will give you credit for the information in the Comendium! Let me
know which quests you are working on so we don't have two quests
completed simultaneously.</p>
