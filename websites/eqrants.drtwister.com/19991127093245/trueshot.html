 COLOR="#ffffff">tart in Kelethin, ask the Ranger Guild Master
about the Trueshot Longbow, he will eventually give you a bag
and a list of items you need to gather to accomplish the quest.
They are spiderling silk, Treant Shards (wood), a micro servo
and dwarven wire.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">First things first, put the bag in the
bank, there is no reason to risk dying and having to go back and
talk to the guildmaster again, and who wants to haul around the
extra weight anyway. Find an NPC shop that will sell you small
lanterns, buy two of them. Next leave Kelethin (make sure you
have a few platinum on you) and find a couple spiderlings, kill
them and take the <B>spiderling silk</B>, you only need one but
may as well grab two. Next head for the Steamfont Mountains. There
you will look for the mechanical spiders, called rogue clockworks.
You have to kill a few of those in order to find the *<B>micro
servo, </B>this can take a while so be patient, and as long as
you are being patient I am going to suggest staying to find three
of the micro servo, they will come in handy later. Ok, after you
find the micro servo our next stop is Butcherblock, wander all
the way to the end of the zone where you end up at the docks.
Wait for the boat and take it to Freeport, there you will look
for a man named Jyle Windshot. BEWARE! There are two Jyle Windshots
in Freeport, one is sitting in a hotel that is there right when
you get off the boat. That is NOT that Jyle that you want, he
will ask for two gold and a Faydark Champions Tunic. The Jyle
you want is in West Freeport. He is on the second floor of the
inn that has a keg in front of it. Ask him about the <B>Treant
Shards</B> and he will inform you that he would like a small lantern.
Give him one of the lanterns and he will give you some wood shards.
Then give him the other lantern and he will give you more wood
shards. Be sure to give them to him one at a time. Ok, you are
now done in Freeport, now time to head back to the boat. On your
way back to Butcherblock the boat will stop at an island, called
sister island, get off there and at the end of the dock are a
couple of buildings. Hop in the first one and buy 6 <B>Kiola Nuts</B>
from the NPC shopkeeper. If you hurry you can buy the nuts and
get back on the boat before it leaves. Ok, now you are taking
the boat back to Butcherblock. After the boat docks get off and
buy 6+ flasks of water from the shopkeeper there. You will need
at least 6, but if you get thirsty you may end up drinking one,
so I would advise buying 8 or so (the water that your forage up
won't work, trust me, I found out the hard way). After getting
the water head for Kaladim. Once there look for a shop called
Irontoe's Eats, ask the shopkeeper their about Tumpy's Tonic.
He will inform you that he needs a flask of water and a Kiola
Nut to make it. Give him a Kiola Nut and a flask of water and
he will give you the Tumpy's Tonic. Repeat this 5 more times until
you have 6 Tumpy's Tonics. Next look for a place called Everhot
Forge. There you will look for Trentor Everhot, ask him about
dwarven wire and he will inform you that he would very much appreciate
a Tumpy's Tonic or two. Give him two of them and he will give
you *<B>dwarven wire</B>. Now give him two more and he will give
you another spool of wire, repeat until you have 3 spools of wire.
You should now have all the items you need to complete the quest.
Get the hell out of Kaladim and Butcherblock and head back to
Kelethin. (oh, I would suggest begging for binds during this quest.
Dying and having to go real far back really sucks) Once in Kelethin
stop at the bank and grab the bag that the Ranger Guild Master
gave you. Put one each of the Spidering Silk, Wood Shards, Micro
Servo and Dwarven Wire in the bag. This should leave you with
1 more Spiderling Silk, 1 more Wood Shards, one more Micro Servo
and two more Dwarven Wire, put the extras in the bank then proceed,
with the loaded bag, to the Rangers Guild. Open up the bag and
hit the button that says &quot;Combine&quot; then hand the bag
over to the Ranger Guild Master. You will get experience, gold
and a Treant Bow Staff. The Ranger GM will ask you if you know
the steps to make a Trueshot Longbow. Ask him about it and he
will tell you what you need to do. He will tell you that you need
1 planing tool, 1 Treant Bow Staff, 1 Micro Servo and 1 Dwarven
Wire. He will also inform you that you need to be a master bowyer
to make the Trueshot Longbow. If you are a master bowyer then
go ahead and try and make it. If not see if you can get someone
to make it for you. You should also have a full set of extra quest
items in the bank, so at a later time you can go ahead and do
the quest again from the comfort of home. The Treant Bow Staff
is a lore item, so I am pretty sure you can only have one of them
at a time, so I would suggest not turning in the quest items again
until someone has made the bow for you or you have made it yourself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#ffffff">*The dwarven wire and the Micro Servo
are now &quot;NO DROP&quot; items which means that it will be
difficult for someone to make the bow for you unless they have
the items already. You can stack the dwarven wire but the micro
servos each take up an inventory slot of their own, so if you
are a master bowyer and want to keep extra quest items around
you are going to need an extra bag to store the micro servos in.</FONT></P>
