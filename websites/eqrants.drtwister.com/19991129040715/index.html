          ----------------------<br>
          In observation of the holidays, the Verant Technical Support
          department will be closed on Thursday the 25th, and Friday the 26th.
          Customer Service (Game Masters) will be lightly staffed on Thursday
          the 25th as well.</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFF80">Within the next two weeks, the Paw zone will
          become a mid-level dungeon. Any characters under level 25 that are
          bound to Paw may want to bind themselves to an area outside. No GM
          assistance will be given to low level players bound to Paw after the
          transformation takes place.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Hot damn! Thanksgiving
      week! You have to love this week! You only have 3 days of work or school,
      then you get to sit around with family and eat like a total pig and watch
      football! If you think about it Thanksgiving is one of the only Holidays
      not totally soiled by gimmicks and retail. You don't often see houses
      decorated with turkey paraphernalia or pumpkin pie decorations. This
      holiday is pretty much just about being with family. There is no
      Thanksgiving mascot that comes around and gives you free gifts or candy,
      instead you get Grandma slaving away in the kitchen all day so that the
      rest of the family get some really good turkey and stuffing. No cutesy
      commercials on TV or giant turkeys in the mall to have your picture taken
      with. Now stop and think about what we are actually celebrating when we
      celebrate Thanksgiving....</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Pretty good weekend for me
      overall. Drank *WAY* too much beer on Saturday though. The beloved
      University of Michigan played the much hated Ohio State Buckeyes so of
      course me and the crew got together with a ton of beer and snacks and
      pretty much sat around for the entire day watching football. Michigan won,
      by the way, so yay for me! I paid the price for it on Sunday though when
      my hung over ass couldn't hardly get out of bed the entire day. I took
      advantage of it by watching a movie that I have been waiting to see, The
      Matrix. That movie kicked so much ass! I watched it with no idea what it
      was about, I just heard it was good and went from there. It is so rare
      that you can watch a movie now-a-days and actually be surprised by it.
      Between the newspaper reviews and overblown previews, movies are generally
      never a surprise. You almost always have a general idea of what the movie
      is about and where it is going to go. It was nice to just sit back and
      enjoy a good movie for a change.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">For those of you who are
      into this sort of thing, you may be happy, or disappointed to hear that
      Quake III has gone gold. In layman's terms the game has been sent off for
      mass reproduction and will be sitting on a store shelf near you soon.
      Hmm...this just on the heals of Epic sending Unreal Tournament out for
      mass reproduction, coincidence, ah who the hell cares, as long ass I get
      two new kick ass games.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">It looks like <a href="http://eq.drtwister.com">Dr.
      TwisTer's EQ page</a> is going to be going through some changes. The
      Darkening posted a message on Wednesday night saying that we will no
      longer be hearing directly from any of their normal updaters. I can only
      assume that Dr. TwisTer himself is going to be filtering through all the
      e-mails and posting only the things that he finds worthy, much as he does
      now on his <a href="http://uo.drtwister.com">UO page</a>. This is probably
      a good thing. I'm not trying to insult the updaters because some of them
      actually try to put some good info up, but when you have multiple people
      posting news to one site I guess you are going to get some that don't
      really get the concept (I refuse to say the name).</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">On a personal note, I know
      that this site isn't really what it was in terms of me posting my news and
      views of the latest EQ happenings. I actually feel a little bad running an
      EQ site when I hardly ever play anymore. For the time I will just continue
      to post stuff like I have been, but I think I am going to start mixing it
      up and throwing some opinions in on other stuff not related to gaming or
      Everquest. I hope you guys can handle that.</font></p>

      Asheron?</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">A lot of people that run
      sites that are somewhat similar to mine (or rather I should say I run
      sites similar to theirs), such as <a href="http://www.wtfman.com">Ronald
      McDonald</a>, <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net">Lum</a> and <a href="http://azile.tradespot.net/">Azile</a>,
      have packed up their bags and moved to Dereth. Dereth, for those that
      don't know, is what the world is called in Asheron's Call. I have opted to
      keep my current residence in good old Norrath, I am just not sold on
      Asheron's Call. I played in the beta and found more things that I didn't
      like about it then things that I found appealing. If you would read some
      of their sites you would think that AC is the second coming
      of...of...well, of something really <a href="http://www.cool.com">cool</a>.
      I'll be the first to admit that I didn't really give it much of a chance,
      but I can normally tell within five minutes of playing something if I am
      going to enjoy it or not. Actually I shouldn't say that, for the first 5
      minutes I really enjoyed Everquest, but anymore I think I would rather
      have my <a href="http://www.ada.org">teeth</a> cleaned with a razor blade
      then log on and try and reach level 20 (I am so close to a surname). I
      guess the question out of this is; have any of you picked up the retail
      version of AC and if so have you enjoyed it? I am curious what other EQ
      ranters think about the game. Stop by the <a href="http://www1.sitepowerup.com/mb/view.asp?BoardID=101274">Ranting
      Board</a> and give me some thoughts, or use the handy, non-flammable,

      people worth reading at the <a href="http://eq.drtwister.com">Dr. TwisTer
      EQ site</a> has decided to quit to pursue other interests. Namely he is
      planning to start his own page. That's cool though, I don't know if I
      would want to just be an updater for someone else's page either. For all
      the work you have to do, you may as well run your own site and get full
      credit. On the very down side of this we will continue to be stuck with
      dark revelation, who continues to come up with gems. Look at this monstrous
      bug he uncovered:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#FFFF80">Hello folks, looks like there's finally
        something USEFULL to post here. Amazing, but true.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFF80">This bug is used to transfer items from one
        character to another on the same account/server. It's virtually useless,
        but it could be used in some circumstances.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFF80">1) Create a character.<br>
        2) Put various items that you want to have transfered on the character.<br>
        3) Kill character, consent another character on your account, log out,
        delete character.<br>
        4) The corpse will remain in game, and the items can be looted.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">At least he has the courtesy to point out that it
      is virtually useless. I don't think I have the energy to bitch about him
      anymore, so I think I am going to try and make this a dark revelation free
      zone. I get e-mails about him so I know there are others that like to rant
      about him. Feel free to use the <a href="http://www.sitepowerup.com/mb/view.asp?BoardID=101274">EQ

      at stomping out bugs and that without many bugs there really isn't too
      much to post on a bug site, but damn....if you don't have anything to post
      then don't post anything at all. It is why I run my own site, I can beg
      for handouts or do whatever the hell I please and the only person I have
      to answer to is myself. (actually I guess since Dr. TwisTer hosts my site
      I would have to answer to him if I did anything to piss him off. But so
      far so good, he hasn't criticized me once) But if you are an updater on a
      major site, then that is totally not cool. Eventually he will get it I
      suppose. Actually he may get booted off the site before he gets it.&nbsp;</font></p>

      Actually I shouldn't say Lions but instead direct my anger at their coach,
      Mr. Bobby Ross. Who in the hell is stupid enough to go for a two point
      conversion when you are only down by 4! Ugh! They missed it and then had
      to go for a touchdown to win instead of a field goal to tie. Well of
      course they missed the touchdown and ended up losing to the sorry ass
      Arizona Cardinals, 23-19.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="left"><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">At least I have the
      University of Michigan, who managed an absolutely awesome win over Penn
      State! I am sure the webmaster over at <a href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/">AllaKhazam's
      Magic Realm</a> doesn't share in my enthusiasm over that one, but
      hey...his site is bigger then mine so at least let me have the football
      win.</font></p>

      <a href="http://www.3dfxgamers.com">3dfx</a> is supposed to have some huge
      announcement regarding their next part, codenamed Napalm. <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com">Voodoo
      Extreme</a> has some detailed information regarding the new chip and some

      'Midweek Notes' if I feel the need to. It'll just be a little break from
      the EQ norm, because let's face facts...we all need a little break from EQ

        that has been recently gone public called &quot;EQmaps&quot; I will not
        mention the link, because I am one of the designers of the maps that has
        been bluntly stolen without my permission from my website. I have
        contacted both web masters; one &quot;NiteRaven&quot; has emailed me
        back saying he is allowed to use my map without my permission, due to
        the fact it is not copyrighted. I have decided to take legal action on
        the Owner of EQmaps Intl they remove my maps, and (by the looks of it)
        the other maps which haven been stolen without permission. I hope the
        public knows this site is nothing more then taking credit for other
        peoples work.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Hmmm...sounds to me like <a href="http://www.eqmaps.com">EQ
      Maps</a> is using someone else's hard work to put together a site. That
      would be the equivalent of me going out and copying an update from <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net">Lum</a>
      or from <a href="http://www.wtfman.com">WTFMan</a> and pasting it here and
      calling it my own. Well, to be fair let's see what EQ Maps has to say
      about this. This is taken from their website, without permission mind you:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#FFFF80">I'd just like to take some time to address a
        few things that have come up the last few days. First of all what seems
        to concern most people is they think that I have stolen these maps, to a
        certain degree that is true. The last couple of months I have spent a
        lot of time programming this site, spending as many as 5 hours at night
        after my full time job and spending countless weekends hacking away at
        the code. That is what I enjoy doing. I consider it fun and challenging
        to learn PHP3 and how a database works. So in doing this it leaves me
        very little time to actually create maps, which I'm not very good at
        anyways. So what I did is go around all the major pages, you know them
        all, and try to find what I felt was good enough quality maps for the
        website. The maps, as far as I know, aren't attached to a specific site.
        I would never take maps from Everlore or Questers of Norrath. They
        belong to them and them alone, although I have asked &quot;Maps&quot;
        two times now if I could use his maps for my website or if he would like
        to work with us. He has done a wonderful job with them. Unfortunately I
        don't think his English is very good and hasn't responded to me. I try
        to give as much credit to the map author as possible, including email
        address if I can find it. I have already had one author of a map mail me
        and he thought it was great his work was getting out and helping people.
        If any author has a problem with their map being on my site I'll happily
        take it down.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Well, the webmaster of the site seems like he
      really doesn't want to cause any problems. He probably should have thought
      that before he went around collecting other peoples maps, but of course hindsight
      is always 20/20. The original creator of the maps probably is going a
      *tad* far n suggesting legal action, but I guess I would be a bit upset if
      someone came and ripped off a bunch of stuff that I worked hard for then
      put it on their own website. Hey, the thought of someone ripping me off is
      actually rather humorous. As if anyone, in their right mind, would want to
      steal any of my stuff. I think I would actually be flattered. You guys
      have any thoughts on this? Who is in the right here?</font></p>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I am well aware that it isn't quite December yet, although <a
      href="http://lum.xrgaming.net">Lum the Mad</a> must have one messed up calendar. He came
      back from his little sabbatical a little early. Instead of taking a month off he just
      decided to take off for the weekend and then he was back at it Monday. Good news for the
      rest of us though, Lum is quite amusing and really an excellent writer. I just hope this
      time he chooses to ignore his e-mail box. It's nice to post players opinions and stories
      based on what players have to say, but if that is all you are going to do then you may as
      well just run a <a href="http://www.sitepowerup.com/mb/view.asp?BoardID=101274">message
      board</a> and save yourself the trouble of having to do the HTML.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">On the other side of the coin, my content has totally sucked
      lately. I'll chalk that up to not having really enough time to play Everquest, and it is
      hard to rant and rave about a game that you log onto once a month. I guess the worst thing
      I can say about EQ right now is that not a lot has changed. I logged on the other day so I
      could see where my character was. I was near Runnyeye in Beholder Maze and the place was
      swamped. Everyone was sitting and camping just as they always do. I couldn't find one
      thing to kill and I couldn't find anyone to group with. I logged on after being online for
      a total of maybe 5 minutes. I know, I really didn't give it much of a chance. But damn, I
      didn't feel like logging on and wandering around for 45 minutes looking for something to
      kill. I get no time to play and when I do it is more of a chore then a game. I don't think
      it is too much to ask to have a game that is continuously paid for and supposedly
      continuously developed to be fun. But what the hell do I know, I am just an idiot with a
      website.</font></p>

      href="http://lum.xrgaming.net">Lum the Mad</a>, has decided to take a hiatus while he
      figures out a way to get his site back to the quality that it once was. Not to say this
      Lum's site isn't a quality site now, but lately all you read there is reader submitted
      entries about the UO counselor program and other garbage. There haven't been a whole lot
      of original rants from Lum. He is good enough and entertaining enough on his own that he
      doesn't need to rely on tabloid crap to draw readers. I mean, when the general updates
      consist of stories about UO GM's having sex with counselors, then it has turned from a fun
      rant site to a National Enquirer trashfest. So Lum, if you read this, which I doubt, I
      hope your month off refreshes you and you get back to writing the rants that first got me,
      and many others, reading your site.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">For those of you living under a rock, Verant has announced that
      they will release the EQ expansion in March of 2000. I am sure a lot of people are
      overjoyed about this. For those that haven't heard about it, here is a list of the things
      that you can expect to see in the expansion:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#FFFF80">-- New continent &quot;Kunark,&quot; located south of Faydwer<br>
        -- More than 20 new adventure zones featuring both beginner and advanced zones including:
        lakes, jungles, crypts, caves, dungeons, ancient towers and underground castles<br>
        -- New playable race, the Iksar (Lizardman)<br>
        -- A new cast of visually stunning non-player characters; grey dragons, reptilian
        monsters, giant scorpions, man-eating plants and more<br>
        -- More object animations featured throughout Kunark that include earthquakes and other
        violent natural&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phenomenon's
        &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        -- A highly detailed world with three times the amount of polygons and larger textures
        than the EverQuest world<br>
        -- All-new ships that will sail from both Antonica and Faydwer to Kunark<br>
        -- Newly created art by famous fantasy artist Keith Parkinson<br>

      board</a>, we already pay to play the game and now Verant is going to expect us to shell
      out some extra money to access a new land. Instead of concentrating on fixing the problems
      that people think exist already, they concentrate their efforts on coming up with a new
      land that will probably introduce a whole new batch of problems. But Verant isn't stupid,
      they are a business. They know that people will pay for this because no one is going to
      want to be left out. OSI did the same thing in UO when they released T2A (and the upcoming
      UO expansion). As long as we are suckers and continue to pay they will continuously find
      things for us to pay for.</font></p>

      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">I hope all you EQ freaks had an excellent Halloween. I sat on my
      ass and did nothing (actually I spent way too much time playing &quot;Age of Empires II).
      The powers that run my townhouse community seem to think it is a bad idea to let kids
      Trick or Treat there. I live in one of the safest neighborhoods in the Metro Detroit area,
      hardly any of the residents are under 50 years old (I am well under 50 years old, in case
      you were wondering), and they don't let kids go out and snag some free candy. What's up
      with that? They are probably scared that the kids will freak out some of the older
      residents and cause them to have some sort of heart attack. Isn't this holiday supposed to
      be for the little kids though? I think I saw on the news the other day that Halloween is
      being marketed more toward adults now then the kids. It is a multi-million dollar a year
      holiday (possibly a billion dollar a year holiday) and I guess the companies that make
      costumes and other Halloween paraphernalia think that there is more money in marketing it
      towards adults that get a weekly paycheck then towards the kids that really enjoy it.
      Everything is for the almighty buck though eh? Pretty soon companies will probably be
      trying to market Valentine's Day toward us working American's. Can you see it? Sitting at
      home filling out Valentine's cards for your coworkers while your kid fills them out for
      his or hers 2nd grade class. Holidays long ago stopped being about family or about kids or
      about anything nice and pure. They are all about $$$. Do you really think the good lord
      Jesus would have us go out and spend hundreds of dollars on gifts for our loved ones to
      celebrate his birthday (not to get all religious on you or anything). Do you think there
      are a ton of kids out there that don't even realize what Christmas is supposed to actually
      be about? Don't get me wrong, I like getting gifts as much as the next webmaster, but
      yesterday I was in a local store and they already had their Christmas stuff up for sale.

      dungeon and I will log on and immediately be trained to death. If I could convince my
      bosses here at the new job that playing Everquest is a productive way to spend a day then
      I would surely have much more to write about. But I don't see that happening anytime soon.
