        <h3>Getting in the Tower: </h3>
        <p>We found this the hardest part - took over 2 hours to
        get from this area to Kirn. Here's my thoughts if they
        are helpful. </p>
        <p>The exit from the city is a long winding tunnel. You
        find the quest npc for another class sitting near a
        pool... keep going... eventually you will come to an open
        area with the tower off in the distance. </p>
        <p>The open area has 2 spawns - a rock golem and
        elemental. Kill those, move up. You have 6 minutes. </p>
        <p>The open area faces the tower... dips down, flattening
        in the bottom before rising again towards the tower. In
        this area before the tower you will come across a few
        roamers... a rat and several rock golems and elementals. </p>
        <p>There is a tunnel to the left which leads to, I
        belive, Master Yael. That's not where you want to go. The
        rat and some rock golems and elementals referred to above
        come from this tunnel and interrupt your progression. </p>
        <p>There are a couple of revenant and wanderer roamers
        here too. </p>
        <p>In front of the castle are two spawns -
        revenant/wanderers. 6 min spawn. </p>
        <p>The question becomes pull to the first opening from
        the tunnel, pull to the flat or just keep on moving
        forward. We pulled to the flat to prevent continuously
        fighting the 6 min respawn at the top. This is tough as
        you attract all of the roamers from the Master Yael
        tunnel. </p>
        <p>I suggest that you pull to the flat but do not pull
        the inside of the tower for one or two rotations... just
        bide your time splitting up the spawn from this area.
        Some rock golems in this area cannot be mesmerised by a
        (very talented) L57 enchanter... so you need some tanks
        to keep an eye on these specific high level golems when
        you find them. </p>
        <p>When you get on top of the flat spawn, wait until the
        two revenants at the doorway spawn and then kill them.
        You then have 6 minutes to kill around 3 revenants in the
        first room of the tower. The trick here is to move
        inside... do not get sophisticated trying to pull the
        tower to outside - the respawn rate and number of mobs is
        likely to be too high. Then it's just a gritty room by
        room assault to keep ahead of the respawn.</p>
