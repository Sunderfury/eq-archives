        Strategy # 1</font></h3>
        <p>Just want to make a post for how to do the hole part
        of the quest, as it is one of the more difficult feats we
        have. </p>
        <p>I found out today that the keeper of the Tomb in the
        left hand courtyard of the revenant tower will eat 3
        groups alive and laugh if you aggro him. the good news is
        that Invis to dead works in the tower. </p>
        <p>Yes i know some of the revs still scowl at you but
        they will NOT attack. Go through the gate, run through
        the middle main doors of the tower and to the back where
        a single door opens to stairs leading upward. follow this
        up a couple flights to Kirn himself, then drop invis to
        dead in his room and kill the three revs in his aggro
        range. Kirn is indifferent, so no AE spells. give kirn
        the icon as soon as you have breathing space, kill him
        and evac out of there or invis to dead again and run out.
        </p>
        <p>My raid failed today because we stopped to pull the
        courtyards and the keeper caught us. 15 coffins and four
        slow bodydrags with my halfling rogue later, i logged.
        The tower is dangerous, dont let the relatively easy time
        you had with the elementals fool you. Get in, get the
        ring and get out. </p>
        <p>It took us about 4 hours to get to the tower. if your
        pullers have never been to the hole, urge them to make
        halfling rogues and get them there, bind them in paineel
        by the hole entrance, sow them and show them around. This
        will save a lot of time. </p>
        <p>Dragging bodies is not easy. 11 mobs after the zone
        in, there is a dropoff you must jump down to progress,
        but you cannot reach coming back. To get back to the zone
        ye will have to have a high picklock skill and be able to
        sneak through the main castle to unlock a door leading
        back to the zone via a long bridge above you. Not
        possible with a 2nd level rogue, as lockpick is too low. </p>
        <p>You are able to drag the bodies to just below the
        dropoff and kill your rogue, giving him a insta deathgate
        to paineel where you can return to the area from the top
        of the dropoff, and from there ye can summon the corpses
        of those below with careful manuevering on the lip of the
        ledge. time consuming, but it works. </p>
        <p>There is a shortcut at one point that involves leaping
        down a waterfall just past the city. if you take this
        route, make it very clear to everyone that they should
        not jump off the waterfall's edge or run off the edge or
        they will splat like an egg instead of hitting the pool
        below. I believe that you take damage from water landings
        if you are encumbered, so make sure noone is lest they
        die. It's a loooong drop. </p>
        <p>If anyone else wants to throw in some tips or accounts
        of successful or failed raids please do so. </p>
