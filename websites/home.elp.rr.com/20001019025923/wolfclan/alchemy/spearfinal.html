        High Scale then abandoned him in disgust, but even that
        was an aftereffect of what caused the king to turn his
        back on his faith. The child is the key! If we put the
        child to rest, Nak may repent of what he has done and the
        mantle may be lifted. The most difficult task is now at
        hand. Find the child, then take proof of her passing to

            have to kill Cazic Thule to get the Iksar Child to
            pop. Super easy kill. One blast of your best DD spell
            would be considered overkill.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>TIP: If you are not interested in clearing
            Fear to obtain the Tear, wait until another raid

        <h2>Lord Rak's Scale</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Return to City of Mist and give the Tear
            to Lord Rak' Ashiir.</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Lord Rak`Ashiir looks down at the tear in his hand and
        says, 'A minion of my god came to me one night. I knew it
        was of Cazic-Thule as I was frozen in terror. My mind
        screamed for me to flee but my body would not respond.
        The being took my daughter and vanished to only he knew
        where. When I regained control of my body and thoughts, I
        felt nothing but [<strong>betrayal</strong>] and I
        immediately set out to abandon Cazic-Thule.' <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You say, 'What betrayal?'</strong><br>
        <br>
        Lord Rak`Ashiir says 'This glorious city around us was my
        doing! I united the villages about the forest in the name
        of Cazic-Thule and built what has become an oasis of
        civilization in a desert of savagery. I did this and my
        god turned his back on me! He took my child for his own
        sadistic pleasure and showed me not one ounce of favor! I
        learned then that my god was a false god and that I was
        the only means to my [<strong>ambition</strong>]. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You say, 'What ambition?'</strong><br>
        <br>
        Lord Rak`Ashiir says 'That very night, I devised ways to
        increase my influence and, at one point, I had a
        revelation. I actually believed I could rule the whole of
        the world. I saw the entire plan before me for a few
        precious seconds, but that was all I needed. I knew what
        had to be done and it began by denying that fool god's
        divinity and showing the people what [<strong>true
        righteousness</strong>] was. It was too easy. The people
        were like the nearly mindless frogloks and molded to my
        image within only a number of decades. I expected it
        would take much longer. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You say, 'What true righteousness?'</strong><br>
        <br>
        Lord Rak`Ashiir says 'One does not need a god to tell
        them what to do, what to believe, how to think.
        Cazic-Thule took my child for no [<strong>reason</strong>]
        and began to torture her! This I know because, every
        night, in my dreams, I heard her cry out in pain and in
        terror. I could not see her or go to her. I was helpless
        and, far in the distance, I heard a hideous laughter that
        mocked me and my inability to help my child. Cazic is not
        a god. He is a fool with emotional disfigurements like so
        many of the vermin that walk this land. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You say, 'What reason?'</strong><br>
        <br>
        Lord Rak`Ashiir says 'He took my child to his horrific
        plane of existence for his own sadistic pleasures! I
        cannot understand what his twisted mind thought he would
        accomplish by doing this! It served NO [<strong>purpose</strong>].
        That witch Neh fasted and prayed and performed rituals
        yet completely disregarded the loss of her child. She
        made me sick. Like one of the frogloks carrying out the
        will of that dragon with no sentience to ask if what they
        were doing was worth their effort. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You say, 'What purpose?'</strong><br>
        <br>
        Lord Rak`Ashiir says 'FOOL! There was NO purpose but
        whatever sick desire Cazic wished! I can only imagine
        what she had to endure at the hands of that charlatan.
        What other reason could it have been? Others who had come
        close to Cazic-Thule, like Kirn, were approached and
        tested. Those who passed became saints like the High
        Scale. But I received only punishment for my service and
        devotion. Are you weakminded enough to believe that what
        I endured [<strong>was not punishment</strong>]? <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You say, 'It was not punishment?'</strong><br>
        <br>
        Lord Rak`Ashiir says 'Not punishment?! You expect me to
        believe that taking my only truly cherished possession
        and tormenting me with her cries was not intended as
        punishment? Then what? Why did he do this? To [<strong>test</strong>]
        me? <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You say, 'What test?'</strong><br>
        <br>
        Lord Rak`Ashiir says 'A test? How could it be a test?
        What was he testing? If he were to approach me as a saint
        what would be my first lesson of spirituality? What was
        he looking for in me? <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You say, 'He was looking for trust.'</strong><br>
        <br>
        Lord Rak`Ashiir stands dumbfounded for many moments
        before finally speaking again, 'Kirn was right. Before he
        left my side and that of Torsis he told me I would have
        the blood of my own people upon my hands. How could I be
        so foolish? Even my idiot wife could see the truth. How
        could I begin to fathom the depth of a god's mind and the
        reasons for his actions? Kirn's prophecy has come to
        light. You have shown me the truth and now I have no more
        use for this. Take it away from me, please, and do with
        it what you will. My father was as much a fool as I have
        been. <br>

        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Take the &quot;Scale&quot; to the Emerald
            Jungle Sentinel Spirit again.</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'What is this? The scale of
        Rak'Ashiir's father? Then Rak has repented his mistake?
        But why is the mantle still in place? If Rak has
        repented, then the mantle should have dissolved since he
        was the one who initiated its construction. But is its
        initiation the key? How could we have been so blind? Kirn
        said Rak'Ashiir had the blood of his people on his hands
        but that is false. Rak merely pointed to a path that
        would lead them to destruction. It was the people who
        chose to follow.</p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What is lost?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'The mantle was the product of
        thousands of faithless individuals. Not the single shroud
        we believed existed. Torsis is now truly cursed for all
        eternity as a great stain upon the universe. Today is a
        sad day, indeed. However, some good can still come of
        this. Your sacrifice and spiritual devotion in this
        matter have become legendary. You have waited for us at
        the bottom of the ocean. You have rubbed out a mighty
        rogue spirit. You have endured the black hole of Torsis
        and entered the a bode of Fear itself to save a child
        from eternal suffering. It is only fitting that we reward
        you with our greatest treasure, the <strong>[Spear of
        Fate]. </strong></p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What of the Spear of Fate?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'The spear was constructed
        millennia ago by Thalger, the first human Heyokah. One of
        the most destructive wasichu of Norrath, Miragul, as he
        is known, had been traveling the world searching out all
        known magic. Wherever he went, he discovered and
        experimented with all forms of dangerous magic. Most of
        the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer
        was capable of. He had haphazardly discovered a way to
        directly create a mantle of negative spiritual energy
        similar to what curses Torsis. He himself had willed into
        existence one of these <strong>[black holes]</strong>. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What of these Black Holes?</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul often retreated to the
        frigid northlands to experiment in solitude. It was here
        that he created a black hole. Unfortunately for the small
        tribes of men who made the northlands their home, this
        new black hole threatened not only their livelihood but
        their entire existence. The mantle was so powerful it not
        only drained the spiritual energy of everything within
        its gaze, it also drained the life force as well. The
        tribes were threatened with complete annihilation. But
        one <strong>[powerful shaman]</strong> stepped forward
        and struck against Miragul's mantle. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What powerful shaman?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Thalger had been the first to
        pass our tests and the timing was lucky indeed. We
        supplied him with materials needed to construct a weapon
        that could pierce the very fabric of the <strong>[cosmos]</strong>.
        First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient
        lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for
        the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using
        nothing but his fingernails. He then split the top of the
        flexible shaft, lodged the blade into place and bound
        them together with the tanned entrails of an ox. Finally,
        he adorned the spear with the magical feathers of a an
        aviak elder. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What of the cosmos?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'Miragul's casting was strong but
        it was a force brought into existence. This force was
        positive in nature, the opposite of nothingness. Even
        though it worked like a void, it was still created by an
        imposition of will. We figured that if we could rupture
        the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or
        non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself. Thalger
        volunteered immediately to pierce the mantle as no
        spirits could even get close to it. In one act of
        devotion and singular purpose, Thalger rode the wind far
        above the land and with one colossal arch ripped a <strong>[breach]</strong>
        across the planes. </p>
        <p><strong>You say, 'What of the breach?'</strong></p>
        <p>Spirit Sentinel says 'The tear in the fabric of
        existence created enough negative material to cancel out
        Miragul's abomination. Thalger's strike was so perfect
        that he cut just enough planar material to destroy the
        mantle and nothing else. Unfortunately, Thalger himself
        was lost in the process. All that was left was the spear
        that fell from the heavens to the ground where we
        recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish
        you to have it. When you strike with it, you must have
        the same singularity of purpose as did Thalger when he
        defeated Miragul's mantle. <font size="3">Thank you,
