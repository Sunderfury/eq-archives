        <blockquote>
            <p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Shaman's
            Velium Tunic:</strong><br>
            <strong>Quest Items:</strong> Terman Underbelly says
            'If you find a corroded chain tunic and three pieces
            of black marble bring them to me and I shall attempt
            to create an enchanted tunic that will serve you
            well. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Shaman's Velium Sleeves:</strong><br>
            <strong>Quest Items:</strong> Terman Underbelly says
            'Three jaundice gems and a set of corroded chain
            sleeves might be an interesting combination. The
            powers of the gems may be harvested to imbue the
            sleeves. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Shaman's Velium Bracer:</strong><br>
            <strong>Quest Items:</strong> Terman Underbelly says
            'Bracers are quite easy to imbue. Simply find three
            crushed opals and a corroded chain bracer and I will
            complete the ritual to enchant them. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Shaman's Velium Gauntlets:</strong><br>
            <strong>Quest Items:</strong> Terman Underbelly says
            'Strong protection for ones hands is important. I may
            be able to craft you a set of powerful chain
            gauntlets if you find a set of corroded chain
            gauntlets and three crushed lava rubies. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Shaman's Velium Coif:</strong><br>
            <strong>Quest Items: </strong>Terman Underbelly says
            'Those who are wise as we are know that protection of
            the head is most important. I may be able to forge
            you something most interesting if you were to bring
            me a corroded chain coif and three pieces of crushed
            onyx sapphire. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Shaman's Velium Leggings:</strong><br>
            <strong>Quest Items:</strong> Terman Underbelly says
            'Leggings are a bit trickier to imbue. Three chipped
            onyx sapphires will allow me to channel the correct
            energies into a pair of corroded chain leggings
            however those chipped onyx sapphires are somewhat
            rare. Return to me if you find such things in your
            journeys. </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Shaman's Velium Boots:</strong><br>
            <strong>Quest Items:</strong> Terman Underbelly says
            'Simply bring me a set of three crushed flame
            emeralds and a pair of corroded chain boots and I
            will imbue them. I bid you good luck in finding such
            things. </p>

        has been reported that the gems and quest armor drop in
        IceWell Keep inside Thurgadin. Mobs therein cons mid 40's
        to mid 50's or higher, so proceed with caution or as a
        guild raid. There have also been reports of gems and
        armor dropping off 55+ mobs deep inside Kael Drakkel, as
