        II Quest*</font></h3>
        <p align="left">Canibalize II, also known as McMerin's
        Feast, is a 39th level shaman spell allowing the shaman
        to &quot;canibalize&quot; their hit points in exhange for
        mana.</p>
        <p align="left">The Canibalize II Quest can be started
        with either &quot;Marlyn McMerin&quot;, the female
        barbarian that sells the alchemy herbs on the docks in
        Firiona Vie, or &quot;Oompah The Great&quot;, the Ogre
        shaman at the ogre raider camp in Timorous Deep for evil
        shamans.&nbsp; </p>
        <h3 align="left"><u>Starting the Quest (ogres and trolls)</u></h3>
        <p align="left">Once you hail Oompah the Great at the
        ogre camp in Timorous Deep, he talks of having spent time
        with a great barbarian shaman family (The McMerins) and
        he stole... errr came away with the spell McMerin's Feast
        when he left them. He wants the same four components as
        noted in the barbarian version of the quest below.</p>
        <h3 align="left"><u>Starting the Quest (barbarians)</u></h3>
        <p align="left">To start the quest in Firiona Vie, find
        Marlyn McMerin in the barbarian hut on the docks
        (location: <strong>- 3820 + 1660</strong>) and hail her.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>You say, 'hail Marlyn McMerin' </p>
            <p>Marlyn McMerin says 'Greetings hearty adventurer.
            Searching for the components necessary for fine
            shaman spells are we? I have come to Kunark in
            [search of rare alchemist components], but I have
            found the dangers of Kunark are far too great for me.
            </p>
            <p>You say, 'I can help search for the rare alchemist
            components' </p>
            <p>Marlyn McMerin says 'Grand!! I have heard word of
            four rare components. Clay of Ghiosk, Crushed Dread
            Diamonds and Powder of Yun. Most rare are chips from
            the bones of one who has touched the Bath of Obulus. </p>

        <h3><u>Getting the Items</u></h3>
        <p>In the simplest terms, the items you need are:</p>
        <p><strong>1) Crushed Dread Diamond</strong>, currently
        obtainable in one of two ways:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Method One (difficult):</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><strong>Step One:</strong> Obtain a Dread
                Diamond by giving a Dufrenite to the Gemcutter
                Skeleton in the Combine City Ruins (city full of
                pyramids near the wizard spire and druid ring in
                the Autumn or Lost Valley - Dreadlands). The
                Gemcutter must be charmed by a high level
                enchanter/necro as he is normally KoS. The
                Gemcutter will in return give you a Dread
                Diamond, which is tradeable.<br>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Step Two:</strong> Obtain a Spectral
                Pestle from any Spectral-type mob in Kaesora, a
                &quot;one-way&quot; dungeon in the Field of
                Bones. They won't give it to you, so you'll have
                to kill them for it. The spawn spot close to the
                zone-in is sometimes the Spectral Guardian,
                reportedly tough but solo-able in early 40's.</p>
                <p><font size="3"><strong>Player Tips:</strong></font></p>
                <p><font size="3">&quot;<em>The ghost-type
                spectrals in Kaesora can also drop the Dusty
                Ransackers Pack a 20% weight reducing bag for
                medium-sized items</em>.&quot;</font></p>
                <p><font size="3">&quot;<em>Spectral pestles can
                also be obtained in trakanon's teeth off of the
                Spectral Iksar ghosts. One has been reportedly
                obtained off of a Spectral Footman. Much easier
                to get there than in Kaesora since it is an
                outdoor zone</em>&quot;</font></p>
                <p><strong>Step Three:</strong> Combine the Dread
                Diamond and the Spectral Pestle in your Medicine
                bag which will either</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>1) give you the Crushed Dread Diamond if
                    you succeed, or</p>
                    <p>2) will return the Dread Diamond to you if
                    you fail, </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>requiring you to kill yet another Spectral
                Guardian to gain another Spectral Pestle and make
                another attempt at combining. Not sure of the
                trivial level to combine these items, but I seem
                to recall someone reporting it trivial at 85
                alchemy skill or less, and someone else saying
                two attempts around 50 skill yielded the prize.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>Method Two (cakewalk):</strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Proceed to Timorous Deep by whatever method
                you prefer. </p>
                <p>Fire up sow and levitation.</p>
                <p>Run to the ice-covered Gorla Island (location:
                <strong>-8840, -6080</strong>)</p>
                <p>There, fairly close to the shoreline, you'll
                see a bag on the snow-covered ground. Pick it up.
                You'll have a pile of white powder called Crushed
                Diamonds, but which identifies at Crushed Dread
                Diamonds. Others have confirmed that this item
                works for the quest. Some have reported the
                re-spawn time on the bag to be 8 hours. Note, you
                might have to kill the Gorla (white ape) that
                stands near the bag, so cons him first.</p>
            </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>2) Clay of Ghiosk</strong> (or strange ochre
        clay) drops from Army Behemoths in the City of Mist -
        Emerald Jungle. Reluctant to part with their clay, you'll
        likely need to get a group to &quot;convince him&quot; to
        give it up. <strong>Player Tip:</strong> &quot;<em>Go in,
        cross the bridge, stay to the right until you get to the
        right courtyard. Clear the area, then work your way to
        the top of the small pyramid there. He's in the upper
        deck, which you can't walk to, but can aggro pull him
        from there. Least that's how I've done it 3 times now</em>.&quot;<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>3) Bones of Obulus</strong> (or greyish bones)
        drops from the Skeletal Warlord in Karnor's Castle -
        Dreadlands. Note, he also drops the Jarsath Bracer (ac 8,
        wis +4). Sometimes, one can simply shout for looting
        rights on the bones since they are of zero use to anyone
        but a shaman doing this quest. This is a very tough
        dungeon, however, considering Canibalize II is a level 39
        spell, so use extreme caution or have a powerful,
        well-balanced, mid-forties or higher group. Some shamans
        have been known to simply wait near the relative safety
        of the zone for a &quot;train-kill&quot; and ask to loot
        the Warlord.</p>
        <p><strong>4) Powder of Yun </strong>(or shaman powder)
        can be obtained from Yun Shamans in Trakanon's Teeth.
        Note that the powder is black in color, not white! Accept
        no substitutes. The correct powder must be obtained from
        Yun Shamans in particular (not other shamans), in
        Trakanon's Teeth (not Firiona Vie) and must be black! He
        won't give it to you? Smack that froggie down!</p>
        <h3><u>Completing the Quest</u></h3>
        <p>Return the 4 items to either Marlyn McMerin on the
        docks in Firiona Vie, or Oompah the Great at the ogre
        camp in Timorous Deep, and you will be rewarded with the
        scroll McMerin's Feast (Canibalize II), a 39th level
        spell that is less efficient than Canibalize I in terms
        of hit point to mana tradeoff, but that can be a faster
        way to regain mana in groups, especially if there's a
        healer with you willing to pass along a few heals in the
        process.</p>
