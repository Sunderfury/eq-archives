            of the guild Soul Assassins was quite bored one Norrathian afternoon. 
            He sent me a message through the lands that he wished to see our arch-enemy 
            the Priest of Discord slain. Many trembled at the thought of messing 
            with the Dark Priest and his 350+ damage staff whacked them on the 
            head. Four brave adventurers were not afraid however. And knowing 
            the stupidity of going face to face with the Leader of the Player 
            Killers; Alyssa of Inner Circle; Kriall of Revelation; Itzlegend of 
            Soul Assassins and myself your humble narrator quite unguilded decided 
            to try anyway. Four people against the hardest hitter on the Norrath 
            Plane. But verily we laid him low, once again showing the strength 
            of the universe that is Lanys Tvyl. <br>

            /ooc Congrats all, it was fun and the first priest slain on our server 
            and possibly done with the least amount of people ever. </font></p>

            Moon sends thanks to all who attended Friday's guild event. 100-150 
            adventurers took part in the 2 hour scouring of Greater Faydark. Guild 
            Master Severas was much pleased by the return of guild items, which 
            had been scattered about. For those who joined in and successfully 
            found the wares, Severas was most generous with the bestowing of gifts. 
            The Guild of the Silver Moon would also like to thank Everlore.com 
            for spreading the word across the lands. Twas our first event and 
            deemed a great success, which could not have been accomplished without 
            your help. <br>
            <br>
            Good Citizens of Norath, look for more fun, frivolous, and roleplaying 
            events in the future from the Guild of the Silver Moon. Hunt Well 
            till next we meet!<br>
            <br>
