You: 'hail Stofo Olan'

<BR>Stofo Olan: 'Good day, I have discovered something truly wonderful! If I only had the materials required so I can copy my notes and send them to my teacher.'

<BR><BR>You: 'what materials?'

<BR>Stofo Olan: 'The materials I need are a mechanical pen, ink of the dark, and white paper. Bring me those and I will give you a copy of this information.'

<BR><BR>You: 'who is your teacher?'

<BR>Stofo Olan: 'My teacher is Jeb Lumsed. He was last seen in the regions of the newly discovered lands. If you wish to find him that is where you must seek him out.'

<BR><BR>You: 'what is the <a href=stofo.html#ink>ink of the dark</A>?'

<BR>Stofo Olan: 'Dark illusions, thievery, and the plague of the living will guide you. These are the only hints I can provide. Safe travels and may you be protected from all maladies.'

<BR><BR>You: 'where is the <a href=stofo.html#pen>mechanical pen</A>?'

<BR>Stofo Olan: 'The answer you seek is in your question. If you are unable to figure it out, then perhaps you are not ready to travel along this path.'

<BR><BR>You: 'what is the <a href=stofo.html#pap>White paper</A>?'

<BR>Stofo Olan: 'It may seem like ordinary paper at first. However, this paper was enchanted by a friend of mine. This paper was given to a lass in the Karanas to help with her writings. The paper will guide her hands and draw forth the thoughts in her mind. I no longer have any and I have not had contact with my friend in some time. Search them out.'

<BR><BR>You: 'What did you discover?'

<BR>Stofo Olan: 'I was researching a new spell, and discovered new information concerning the history of the Serpent.'

<BR><BR>You give Stofo Olan Ink of the Dark.

<BR>You give Stofo Olan A White Paper.

<BR>You give Stofo Olan A Mechanical Pen.

You: 'what is the ink of the dark?'

<BR>Reania Jukle: 'Ink of the Dark, you say? That isn't an everyday item, you know. In fact i can't remember the last time someone requested it. I have given up keeping any here with me. You are going to need to find your own supply now. Sorry.'

<BR><BR>You: 'where can I find the ink of the dark?

<BR>Reania Jukle says 'The ink is the blood of a dark scribe. Tempt him and give him this vial. He should cooperate.'

<BR><BR>You: 'What do you know about a mechanical pen?' <BR>Rilgor Plegnog says 'Why do you want one of those contraptions. You will spend more time repairing it then you will writing with it. But if you insist on getting one, you are going to have to do a small favor.' 

<BR>Rilgor Plegnog tugs at your robe and grins evilly. Mighty nice outfit you have there. Sure beats these drab robes us three are wearing. Hmm...my favorite color is purple, in fact a shiny metallic purple would do nicely. How bad did you want that pen?'

<BR><BR>You: 'what writing materials'

<BR>Chrislin Baker: 'A passing illusionist gave me some enchanted writing materials. He said they would help inspire me to capture my mind's images on paper. If you would just be so kind as to bring me plain old paper and a quill from Qeynos, I can get back to writing.

<BR><BR>You turn in the Paper and Quill

<BR>Chrislin Baker: gives you a hug. 'Thank you so much. I did some cleaning after you left and found this behind a barrel. It may have been left behind by the person who took my materials. You can have it.'
