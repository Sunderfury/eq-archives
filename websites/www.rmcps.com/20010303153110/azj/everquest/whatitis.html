So what is Everquest anyways?

Everquest is an on-line RPG that you play in REAL TIME!<p>
It is not quite the same as quake or other first-person
shoot-em-ups. It does not rely on you to press your fire button as
fast as possible or to have an ultra fast connection to the
internet to be able to win. It does requre you to make decisions on
fight or flight with some immediacy though. This game may only be
played on-line, and they have taken steps to insure that hackers
cannot cheat or otherwise ruin this game. (Like so many other on-line
games have been ruined)<p>

<p>When you begin the game you first pick a server you will play
on. Currently there are around 20 servers. Your character will
only exist on one server, and can only interact with players on
that server. You must choose from 12 races (elf, human,
barbarian, troll, ogre, to name) and 14 classes (warrior, ranger,
wizard, magician, paladin, etc), and also pick a face and name
for your character. Not all races can be all classes. When you
start out, you will barely know which end of a sword to hold, and
almost anything can kill you. The more you play, the better you
get at your various abilities (offense one-handed slashing,
spellcasting, etc). Not all classes can cast spells, use swords,
or wear armor. Follow the link to Everquest Stratics for
detailed info on classes, races, and abilities.<p>

Once you have your character created, you
must make a choice: Will you kill other players (called PvP) or
not. If you choose to do so, your name will always appear in red.
You will only be able to kill other PvP players though, and if
you are hurt, only another PvP player will be able to heal you.
Regular (non PvP) players cannot be hurt by you. The only
exception to this rule is a Duel. Any player may challenge any
other player to a Duel. If the other player accepts, you can then
hurt each other.</p>

<p>If you die in the game, you come back without any of your
items in the spot where you were originally &quot;born&quot;. You
must then travel to the place where you died, and loot your own
corpse to recover your items. The world of Everquest is BIG! It
can take you 3 hours to get across the main continent. If you
died on the opposite side of the continent from where you are
born, you could be in big trouble. There is a spell called
&quot;bind&quot; that will change where you come back to though.
There is also another spell called &quot;Resurrect&quot; that
will bring you back where you died. So all is not always lost.</p>


Once you start
playing this game, beware! You can become seriously addicted to
it! (Hi, my name is Aaron, and I'm a EQholic.)</p>
