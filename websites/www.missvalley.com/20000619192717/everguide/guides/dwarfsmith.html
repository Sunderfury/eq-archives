        <h1 align="center"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Dwarven 
          Guide to Smithing</font></b></font></h1>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">So ye would 
          like to be a smith eh?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">I've gone 
          through the guides available for smithing on other sites, and every 
          one of them tells you to start making skewers after reaching a skill 
          level of 28-30. Doing this will cost you HUNDREDS of platinum, and in 
          my humble opinion is a wasted of time. The guide below is tested to 
          get you to a skill level of 55 while giving you something to sell rather 
          than wasting all of your time trying to make skewers.</font></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">First, save 
          up 20 practice points. You can start smithing earlier, however I would 
          reccomend you start around level 20ish so that you can easily afford 
          the materials. Put all 20 points on blacksmithing, and start to gather 
          as many rusty weapons as you can.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">Skill Level 
          0</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">-Dump 20 
          practice points on smithing at your guildmaster, any other method will 
          simply take too long in my opininion.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">Skill Level 
          20</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">-Sharpen 
          Sharpen Sharpen. Speed kill every newbie monster you can find in BB, 
          Freeport, and Lesser Faydark, and sharpen their weapons. 2h swords will 
          take you all the way to 30 skill. This is going to take some patience 
          on your part, the rusty weapons are too expensive to buy, and you'll 
          have to deal with the spawns but keep at it.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">Skill Level 
          28-30</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">-Purchase 
          as much ore as you can (I grabbed 2 backpacks full from the windmills 
          and gated home) (buy only small pieces of ore)<br>
          -convert them into metal bits, all of them.<br>
          -buy scaler molds outside of Kalidim and follow the directions in your 
          smithing book to make scalers until you reach 40 skill.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">(This is 
          where most guides tell you to skip ahead to skewers however scalers 
          will give you more exp at this level than skewers and you should have 
          about a 1 in 3 chance of making them or better. At the time I wrote 
          this guide scalers were bugged, and they produced a lid mold instead 
          of a scaler, but it matters not, you can sell them back to the shops 
          for money to continue smithing. If you were to try skewers at this point, 
          you'd probably never make a skewer and would be throwing all that money 
          down the drain)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">Skill Level 
          40</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">-Purchase 
          more ore (as much as you can afford, like a backpack or two full) and 
          convert it into metal bits.<br>
          -Purchase Lantern Casing molds, empty bottles, and as much water as 
          you have metal bits.<br>
          -make large lanterns until it is trivial for you. Skewers are STILL 
          too hard to make, if anyone tells you to make skewers tell them thanks 
          for the info but i'm doing just fine.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">(you will 
          have a decent success rate at lanterns, and hey, guess what, it's the 
          first Item you can make as a smith that is actually wanted by players! 
          Selling them back to shops will gain you a bit over a gold piece per 
          lantern, but players will buy them for up to 3 gold pieces in places 
          like Freeport, or anywhere races without infravision live. Lanterns 
          should take you well over 55 skill, and if you've got the extra money 
          to purchase some metal sheets you'll notice that you can start making 
          banded gorgets around 55 skill with about a 60% failure rate.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">Skill Level 
          55-65</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">BANDED YAY!</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">-Purchase 
          as many metal sheets as you can, I buy them in Kelethin. Get your gorget 
          molds for the size of gorget you wish to make, and go to town until 
          that item is trivial or you have a really good success rate.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">(banded items 
          are the same ac as chain, and are lighter. You can even sell them to 
          players or trade for chain gorgets. Your cost on banded gorgets is going 
          to run you up to 3-4p at first so you're not going to make any money 
          selling them for 3-4p each but as time goes on it'll get easier and 
          your cost will drop to under 2p per gorget. Other items of banded, will 
          take much more skill to be successful at a decent rate, and you're going 
          to saturate the market with banded gorgets here, so travel, sell what 
          you have made, and have patience. Tunics, Pants, Arms, Boots and things 
          of that nature are going to take around 100+ skill to make, so I wouldnt 
          be wasting money on them yet.)</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#FFFFFF">This is where 
          my smith is today, level 21 with 55 skill. I'll keep updating this guide 
          as he improves and finds the best methods to increase your skill, and 
          not cost you a fortune.</font></p>
