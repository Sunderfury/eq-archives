        <P> 
        <P> Followers of Brell Serilis believe that the surface world is a waste 
          of space. They find true happiness in the caves, caverns and tunnels 
          that perforate the belly of Norrath. But this is one of few points that 
          all followers of Brell can agree upon. There are many different factions 
          who all worship Brell. The Runny Eye Clan of Goblins claim he is their 
          father much to the disgust of the Dwarves of Kaladim who know that the 
          Dwarves are the true children of Serilis. But the vicious Gnolls of 
          Split Paw disagree entirely. For was it not Brell who sculpted them 
          out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis in one 
          form or another can be found nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot 
          of Norrath.
