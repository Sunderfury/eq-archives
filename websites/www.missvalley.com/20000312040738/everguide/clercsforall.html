        <p align="center"><b><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What 
          every class should know about your local Priest...</font></b></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Walk into any level 25+ 
          dungeon on norrath today, and you'll find one of two things, either 
          a group wanting a healer, or groups that are using a hybrid healer. 
          What you won't see, at least for very long, are a full group without 
          a healer unless they just happen to be crazy enough to try it. Below 
          are the three main types to look for:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Cleric - The cream of the 
          crop for healers.<br>
          Shaman - Great backup for a Cleric, can also serve as the main healer 
          but is best as backup.<br>
          Druids - Not good as the main healer, minimal effectiveness at backup 
          for a Cleric or Shaman.<br>
          Paladins - Forget it, their healing is not good during fights as monsters 
          will be doing more dammage per hit than they can heal per cast.<br>
          Rangers - As far as healing goes, rangers fall into the same category 
          as Paladins.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This leaves us with three 
          classes to consider, the Cleric, Shaman, and Druid. Below are my experiences 
          with each one:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Clerics - </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Clerics you will find are 
          the most sought after healers in all of Norrath. To have one in your 
          party really strengthens your ability to fight the larger, more dangerous 
          mobs. Of course, you get bad Clerics now and then, but hopefully my 
          guide below will help many of them to become better. If at all possible 
          a cleric should have backup. I favor Shamans as my backup, because at 
          my level they can cast greater heal, and when you're OOM having the 
          shaman back off and heal will save not only your arse but everyone elses. 
          Shamans (at least good ones) are the best backup class i've ever had 
          as a Cleric.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Shaman - </b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Shaman can serve as the 
          party healer if need be, but if you have a cleric use the shaman as 
          a tank/nuker, but the shaman should try and save about half manna to 
          back up his cleric.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Druid -</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Best as a nuker if you ask 
          me, but can serve as a backup healer if need be. A better healer than 
          the ranger or paladin by far, but their heal spells at level 30 compare 
          to a level 14 Cleric.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ok, so now, those of you 
          who are Clerics want to know how to be good ones? First a few rules 
          to follow:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i><b>1</b>. Never join 
          a group that expects you to nuke repeatedly, if they are using you as 
          a nuker, someone, probably you, is going to die.<br>
          <b>2</b>. Look for your backup in a group, and let them know you'll 
          be counting on them as such. Ask your backup to save X amount of manna 
          for healing and let the party know when you are getting low.<br>
          <b>3</b>. If you're getting hit in a large fight, and you need to be 
          healing your group, ask for someone to draw off the monster. If they 
          can't, nuke it if necessary, but if they won't pull monsters off their 
          healer, find another group. It's not cowardice to ask to have a monster 
          taken out of your face, it's just plain good sense. If you're interrupted 
          at that crucial moment, someone just may die.</i><br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Ok, you've found a good 
          group, you have a backup healer, and are ready to go, what should you 
          do with your manna?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i>About healing....</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">-NEVER deal dammage on your 
          last half bar of manna unless your party needs you to. At level 30, 
          a half bar of manna probably means 3 greater heals, and you should try 
          not to use low efficency dammage spells with that last bit of manna. 
          I'm serious here, save that manna for your party who are keeping you 
          alive.<br>
          -Keep your party even on health. Don't just memorize the high heal spells, 
          mem a lower one so that you can keep everyone even. At level 30 I probably 
          use the plain ol' heal spell 2x as much as I do greater heal. Plain 
          ol' heal can be cast 3 times per bub of manna and is very easy to cast 
          even if you're being hit. Want to know if you have a good cleric in 
          your party? After the fight is over, take a peek.. if everyone in the 
          party (who was tanking) seems pretty even on health, you've got a good 
          healer, do what you can to protect him.<br>
          -Don't be afraid to be a bit bossy, if you're low on manna, and you 
          know your party isn't going to make it, tell them to zone the mob, if 
          they don't listen just med, do what you can to heal, and be ready to 
          run when they fail. Some players simply won't listen to their cleric, 
          which can be pretty dangerous. Think about it, your cleric watches everyone's 
          stats throughout all of their fights. He knows what you can and can't 
          handle, and what he can do to improve your chances. When your cleric 
          says zone, you might want to take him seriously. If your party does 
          zone, and takes the mob with them, be prepared for that mob to come 
          after you. It's likely the best clerics will be the last ones out of 
          the zone, so if that mob is in front of you, your party is going to 
          make it to the zone, but you know you're gonna have to go thru that 
          mob to zone as the last person out, now is the time to bust off that 
          longer lasting invul spell and race thru the mob. Being the last one 
          out alot of the time, means you're going to have to have good survival 
          instincts, you're definately worth more to your party alive than dead.<br>
          -Meditate in-between healing!!! I cannot stress this enough, that smidgen 
          of manna you gain back inbetween heals might just be enough for another 
          heal or at the very least a gate if things go very wrong.<br>
          -Keep your low level AND your high level Divine spell mem'd. Alot of 
          Clerics don't relize that that level 29 Divine spell is so hard to cast 
          while being hit, that it's almost useless. BUT when you've had to cast 
          that silly level 5 spell and have put some distance between you and 
          the mob, the level 29 Devine Barrior spell will serve you well if you 
          have the manna. You'll find when things go badly, and you have to run, 
          a good cleric will most likely be low on life, maybe even lower than 
          his party, and out of manna, or close to it. A good cleric would sacrifice 
          hismelf for his party, but if he has good survival skills he may not 
          have to. Remember if it all went bad, you may need to be rezing soon, 
          so try to make it to a zone alive.<br>
          -Heal the party members first, don't worry about your own stats until 
          you are in danger. Your backup healer should be watching your stats 
          anyway. If he's not, it's time for a discussion about tactics again.<br>
          -Don't waste greater heals, at level 30 gheal will give back almost 
          2 bubs of life to a warrior, so unless he's down to half life i wouldn't 
          use it. Regular heal is much more efficent at level 30 to top off a 
          character's hp than gheal. Especially if you have a full group to worry 
          about, which you will.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i>About nuking....</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">-Don't at first until you 
          know your party. Look to see how they do without you nuking, and keep 
          them healed. If you're level 30ish group is fighting level 30+ mobs, 
          it's likely you'll spend most of your time medding and healing rather 
          than fighting. Don't despair, a good group will give you some loot, 
          if they don't, don't be afraid to speak up for some. Clerics rarely 
          get a decent share of the loot, it's just something we get used to rather 
          than cry about. When we're level 39 and 49 we'll be the richest people 
          around charging for those exp restoral resurrections.<br>
          -Nuke if there is a runner. Runner's can cause trains, and if one of 
          your nuke can stop a runner, use it without hesitation.<br>
          -Feel free to nuke with the first 30% of your manna if you are full, 
          after that you should really think about saving it for heals, and after 
          you're at half manna, you should only be healing.<br>
          -Don't be the first to nuke a mob. Wrath WILL pull a mob to you, and 
          you'll be getting hit, therefore you will have a hard time healing others. 
          let your party do some dammage or hit with your blunt until the mob 
          is down to at least half life before nuking.<br>
          -Forget the area spells, they are useless in dungeons unless a mob has 
          a fleeing party member pinned down. Area spells will get you and your 
          party killed very quickly. Inspire Fear is one of the biggest train 
          starters in the game.<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i>Buffing....</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">-Buffs buffs buffs. Don't 
          use all your manna buffing your party. Your buffs will help, but don't 
          cast them on everyone in the part at the same time. A shaman can buff 
          more players at once because they can cannabalize for more manna when 
          needed. Look for the members of your party with the least hit points 
          or lowest armour class and buff them first.<br>
          -Symbol spells are very nice, but do require reagents that can become 
          costly at levels below 30. Use these spells sparingly and use them mostly 
          on your melee types and pure casters to increase their longevity in 
          a fight.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Forming that party for 
          a hard dungeon... <i>(Recipie for Success)</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">-If the choice is up to 
          you, the most effective parties in dungeons with harder mobs will include 
          the following:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1-2 pure tanks, including 
          Warriors, Paladins, or Rangers, but at least one Warrior is almost a 
          must.<br>
          1 Cleric. If you don't have one, you should be looking for one.<br>
          1 Backup healer and buffer, Shamans are my first choice, druids are 
          my second choice, another cleric is great!<br>
          1 Nuker. A wiz with high dammage spells will do nicely, or a Druid or 
          Enchanter. Above level 30 the evac spell some pure casters get is very 
          nice.<br>
          1 Bard. Bards are great pullers, and can heal you at a constant rate, 
          as well as tank while dealing dammage with songs or healing or buffing 
          their party.<br>
          1 Rogue. Rogues are one of the most forgotten classes in the game. They 
          are exceptional at scounting, pulling, and chasing down runners to stop 
          a potential train. Be sure and buff them, their HP are that of a hybrid 
          type, not like a Warrior.<br>
          <br>
          If you can form a party with a combination of classes such as above, 
          you'll go far in this game, and with a good cleric, one who is more 
          concerned with his party's well-being than his own, you will probably 
          be unstoppable. Tactics count in any rough situation, choose a leader 
          and have him call the retreat if he feels it's necessary. Make sure 
          your pullers understand what you can and can't handle, and choose a 
          puller who will take a mob to the zone instead of back to their party 
          if it gets too hairy. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i>One last word on loot....</i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Those of you who are not 
          the healer types need to make sure that the healers get loot. Most Clerics 
          spend their time broke because they are usually in back healing and 
          don't get the chance to loot. Simply ask your healers if they have gotten 
          any loot, and pass em some if they havn't. Keep them wanting to stay 
          in the group, because experience is one thing, but the money to improve 
          their stats with items and buy that additional spell will help just 
          as much as the experience. Look at your average warrior's bank account 
          at level 30 and then at a Clerics of the same level, you'll see the 
          Cleric with a severe cash flow problem unless he spends his time with 
          good groups. Keep it in mind, the guy behind you who kept you alive 
          deserves some of the spoils too, and probably won't get the chance to 
          get it himself.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If anyone has questions 
          about my tactics for Clerics, please pass them on to me, and I'll try 
          and incorporate them into this guide at a later date. A bad Cleric can 
          be a terrible addition to a group. Get a greedy cleric and it's likely 
          he'll be spending his time nuking instead of healing to get that loot. 
          If a party member dies in the reach of a Cleric who was not being hit 
          at the time, something is wrong and tactics need to be discussed with 
          the whole party. The key to advancing in the higher levels is teamwork, 
          and your Cleric will need your help, just as much as you need his.</font></p>
