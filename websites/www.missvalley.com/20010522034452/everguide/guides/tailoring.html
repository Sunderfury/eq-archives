        <h2 align="center">Tailoring Guide</h2>
        <hr>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><u><b>Summary</b></u></p>
          <p>Tailoring is the skill of making items out cloth and leather type 
            materials. Currently in EverQuest tailors are limited to making items 
            only from the pelts of animals. This is rather limiting, but we believe 
            that as time goes on and EverQuest has cleaned up most of the bugs, 
            they will begin expanding the skills and adding new options and features. 
            Tailoring as limited as it seems is still the most popular trade skill 
            because of it's simplicity. Unlike the blacksmithing skill it does 
            not require a vast amount of knowledge in order to make leather armor 
            out of pelts. On the other hand the pelts are rather difficult to 
            get because they can not be bought, they must be hunted, and this 
            can be time consuming.</p>
          <p>All in all as with most of the trade skills, Tailoring leaves a little 
            something to be desire but you can certainly make a decent living 
            at it if you follow this guide.</p>
          <p><b><u>Tools of the Trade</u></b></p>
          <p>Small Tailoring Kit - The tailor kit is a container in which you 
            place your materials. Whenever you are attempting to create something 
            put your materials in this container and hit the <i>combine</i> button. 
            After hitting combine you will either succeed or fail. If you have 
            succeeded the new item will appear under your cursor for you to place 
            into your inventory.</p>
          <p>Large Tailoring Kit - Same as the small tailoring kit however the 
            small kit only allows you to make patchwork armor while the large 
            kit will allow you to make studded and reinforced leather armors.</p>
          <p>Patterns - In order to make anything you must have a pattern first. 
            If you are making a tunic you must have a tunic pattern, etc. Size 
            doesn't matter here, the size of the item is based on the type of 
            pelt used.</p>
          <p>Pelts - In order to make your items you will need pelts, and lots 
            of them. They go pretty fast either from failures or from sales. There 
            are always plenty of newbies around that need patchwork armor so you 
            should probably start by gathering as many ruined wolf pelts as you 
            can.</p>
          <p>Studs - Studs are used in the construction of studded leather armor 
            and may be obtained from a blacksmith or a shop that sells them.</p>
          <p>Steel Boning - Steel Boning is used in the construction of reinforced 
            leather armor and may be obtained from a blacksmith or a shop that 
            sells it.</p>
          <p><b><u> Item Information</u></b></p>
          <p><u>Pelt Sizes List:</u></p>
          <p>Small Sizes - Typically smaller pelts make smaller sized armor. The 
            only small sized pelts that I have found that will make small sized 
            armor is the wolf pelts. </p>
          <p> Medium Sizes - Medium sized pelts will make medium sized armors. 
            Medium sized pelts include cat pelts. </p>
          <p>Large Sizes - Larger pelts will make larger armor. Known large pelts 
            include bear pelts.</p>
          <p><u>Pelt Quality List:</u></p>
          <p>Ruined Pelts - Patchwork Armor</p>
          <p>Medium Quality Pelts - Studded Leather Armor</p>
          <p>High Quality Pelts - Reinforced Leather Armor</p>
          <p><u>Available Patterns</u></p>
          <p>Note that these are all of the items that we have been able to locate. 
            There may be others. If you happen to know that such items exist that 
            are not on this list by all means contact us. There are obviously 
            some items that are not on this list that should be such as belts, 
            bracers, face, shoulder pads, etc. but they are not listed because 
            we have not found them.</p>
