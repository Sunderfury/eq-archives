            <blockquote> 
              <p align="left"><b><u>Abjure</u></b> - One of the schools of magic. 
                Abjuration is the grouping of defensive type spells. This school 
                of magic enables the spell caster to use buff spells such as courage, 
                holy armor, etc. </p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Alchemy</u></b> - Alchemy allows you to make 
                potions. Potions have magical effects and can enhance your abilities. 
                They also sell for quite a bit of money. A good alchemist can 
                make a very nice living. </p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Alcohol Tolerance</u></b> - Dwarves are well 
                known for this skill. This measures your ability to handle the 
                effects of alcohol without adverse side effects. Mostly a role-playing 
                skill (Dwarven drinking contests and such).</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Alter</u></b> - Another school of magic. Spells 
                from this grouping are for altering or changing things. Some examples 
                of this form of magic are illusion, teleport, and change form 
                spells.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Apply Poison</u></b> - This is typically a 
                thief or assassin skill and is used for placing poisons on weapon's 
                .</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Archery</u></b> - This is the ability to use 
                a ranged or missle weapon. Some examples of missle weapons are 
                bows, slings, and crossbows.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Backstab</u></b> - This is another theif skill 
                that is for a surprise attack. If you are able to get behind someone 
                and attack from behind it will enhance the amount of damage that 
                you can inflict. It is difficult to use but when you score you 
                score big.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Baking</u></b> - This ability deals with the 
                making of foods. Specifically cakes, breads, and casseroles. </p>
              <p align="left"><u><b>Bandage</b></u> - This allows you to be able 
                to heal someone without the need of spells. This skill comes in 
                quite handy when you are out of mana or can't cast spells because 
                of your class.</p>
              <p align="left"><u><b>Bash</b></u> - This is a combat based skill 
                that deals with pummelling your opponent to death. Some classes 
                may use this skill without a shield but most require a shield 
                to be able to use the skill. In any event the bash attack makes 
                a real nifty sound when used with a shield.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Begging</u></b> - This is a very hard skill 
                to succeed with. And a sometimes dangerous skill. This skill allows 
                you to beg from npc's in the hopes that they will give you money 
                for nothing. Most npc's won't give you anything else you are really 
                really good in this skill, the problem is, most npc's hate beggars 
                and if you repeatedly beg from someone you could wind up dead 
                instead of richer.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Blacksmithing</u></b> - This is a very difficult 
                but rewarding skill. This skill enables you to make weapons, armor, 
                and other items made from metal. A good blacksmith will be a rich 
                blacksmith, but the supplies are very expensive and most items 
                require many different materials to make.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Block</u></b> - This allows you to effectively 
                negate an opponents attack by blocking it. Very useful skill, 
                especially when combined with a shield. A good block skill will 
                effectively make up for a lack of armor.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Blunt Weapons 1-Handed</u></b> - This is another 
                combat based skill and allows you to use one handed blunt weapons. 
                Some examples are maces and clubs.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Blunt Weapons 2-Handed</u></b> - This is the 
                same as the one handed blunt weapon skill but gives you the ability 
                to use two handed blunt weapons. Two handed weapons deal out more 
                damage but you can not use a shield while wielding them. So there 
                is some give and take. </p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Brass Instruments</u></b> - This is the ability 
                to use brass instruments to make music. This is also the beginning

                beverages, typically alcoholic beverages.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Channel</u></b> - This is yet another school 
                of magic, and enables the user to cast channeling type magic. 
                This type of magic deals with reducing the amount of time required 
                to cast a spell regardless of it's nature.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Conjure</u></b> - This is another school of 
                magic, and enables the caster to use conjuring spells. Conjuring 
                spells allow you to bring items and creatures into existence from 
                somewhere else. Some examples are summon creature spells and summon 
                food and drink spells.</p>
              <p align="left"><b><u>Defense</u></b> - This is the ability to defend 
                yourself. Unlike the block and dodge spells, this is a more general
