        <P> 
        <P> Followers of Bristlebane believe in having fun, at the expense of 
          nearly all else. Bards, rogues, jesters, gamblers and gypsies are all 
          typical followers. They are almost always very charming, clever, and 
          witty, traits which all Bristlebane followers should strive to have. 
          Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes are performed 
          as if they are the highest of rituals. Very few of Bristlebane's followers 
          are outright wicked in their desires but it is best to keep at least 
          one eye on your purse if they are about. And never let one deal you 
          a hand of King's Court.
