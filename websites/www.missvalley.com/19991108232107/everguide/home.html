                  <p>You probably have already heard, but the Ruins of Kunark 
                    website has finally been opened. You can check it out <a href="http://www.everquest.com/kunark">here</a>. 
                    Personally, I think it is going to be awesome. But I don't 
                    think we should have to pay for it. We already paid $50 for 
                    the game and we have to pay $10 a month. What's the $10 for 
                    if we have to buy the updates? Oh well. Anyway, I'm slowly 
                    updating the page so check back again soon! Thanks!</p>

                  <p>Well, this is the new scheme for the page. This is just a 
                    test and I haven't had time to put everything up yet, so look 
                    for more stuff coming within the next few days. The page should 
                    be well along by the weekend. I need some feedback on the 
                    scheme so I can make it suitable to everyone. </p>
                  <p>In other news, I am in need of pictures! I need pictures 
                    of different monsters, pieces of equipment, and just plain 
                    artwork that you think should be posted. If I can get enough 
                    pictures of monsters and animals I will be putting in a bestiary 
                    page, and I will do research to find out some information 
                    on these monsters. I also need pictures of pieces of equipment 
                    along with their effects. The easiest way to do this is to 
                    right click on the equipment and then press the - key to take 
                    a picture. I would prefer the files to be in jpg format and, 
                    if you send in more than one, in a zip file. I hope I can 
                    get these pages up soon so send those pictures <a href="mailto:svenn@mindspring.com">here</a> 
                    with the subject &quot;EverGuide Pictures&quot;.</p>

                  <p>Effective today, EverGuide is officially closed, due to some 
                    personal reasons, as well as due to lack of a support staff. 
                    I'd like to extend my thanks to the 114,000 visitors this 
                    site has had in the last five months, and to the staff that 
                    made this site as great as it once was.</p>
                  <p>The site will stay up until the end of the month, at which 
                    time it will be taken down. Between now, and the end of the 
                    month, any material here on the website that would prove useful 
                    to other fan sites of EverQuest may be copied and reposted,

                        <p>One of the most hated dungeons in the game by lower 
                          level players, and one of the most loved dungeon in 
                          the game for the high 20's or early 30's player. Even 
                          on a good day Unrest can be killer. How do you survive? 
                        <p>Lower Levels 10-20
                        <p>Ok, you've got two choices here, group or die. The 
                          trains are terrible in Unrest. You will most likely 
                          have problems with death beetles who only train you 
                          if you attack undead creatures. Fighting one skeleton 
                          is going to mean you're going to fight a couple of death 
                          beetles at the same time, which can end a low level 
                          character's career in a jiffy.
                        <p>Mid Levels 20-32
                        <p>Ok, you're the cream of the crop for Unrest adventurers. 
                          Some of you will be able to solo Dark Boned Skels all 
                          the way up to the harder high 20's creatures like Skeletal 
                          Monks. BUT, if you can get a group i'd sure advise it. 
                          Don't be shy, stay near the zone, and auction for a 
                          group while you pick off trains that pass by. I've spent 
                          hours looking for a group in the past, but the exp I 
                          gained while grouped was definately worth the wait.
                        <p>Another rule of thumb to follow in unrest, and any 
                          other dungeon for that matter, is keep a mage/cleric/caster 
                          in your group. One caster per 2 tanks is pretty much 
                          a minimum at mid to high levels. I've gone in the basement 
                          of Unrest myself with a full group of level 30 tanks, 
                          and we were all dead within about 5 minutes. Clerics 
                          are what you need in unrest, and you're also either 
                          going to need backup for that cleric (another cleric) 
                          or you're going to need a nuker. Bottom line is, stay 
                          out of the higher level areas unless you've got 2 casters 
                          in your group, and at least one should be a cleric.
                        <p>Higher Levels 32-50
                        <p>Why are you wasting your time in Unrest? Get that item 
                          you want and move on, there are better places for you!
                        <p>I think most people understand the mechanics of Unrest 
                          fairly well, at least those that travel there alot. 
                          First you've got to get through the cauldron, which 
                          for a low level player can be a death warrant as well. 
                          Then you've got to get IN Unrest. The zone into unrest 
                          is full of trains at least every 2-3 minutes. Be careful 
                          zoning in, you might just be dead by the time your computer 
                          finishes loading. Clerics should keep invis to undead 
                          mem'd, as you're going to need it. Druids and Shamans 
                          should keep SOW on their party, it'll save someone's 
                          life every time. Clerics, if you're the only healer, 
                          don't do dammage, save it for heals! I've seen small 
                          fights in Unrest last 5 minutes or longer because the 
                          mob just keeps getting larger with trains. Shamans, 
                          Druids, and Paladins, as well as anyone else who can 
                          heal, BACK UP YOUR CLERIC! Watch for the dreaded &quot;low 
                          manna&quot; or &quot;oom&quot; from your cleric, use 
                          your heal spells to give your cleric time to meditate! 
                          And at all costs, keep the mobs off the healer, if you 
                          don't you're going to find yourself very dead.
