        <h1 ALIGN=Center> <b>Brewing </b></h1>
        <P ALIGN=Left> So you've decided to brew, huh? Well good for you! There 
          aren't many of us out there. I have listed here everything I know about 
          brewing, including where to get the materials and how to make different 
          types of Alcohol. Brewing is fairly inexpensive so practicing it a lot 
          shouldn't be too hard. 
        <P ALIGN=Left> First, you should put a few, I would say between 10 to 
          15, skill points into brewing. The next thing you need is a book of 
          limericks. If you do not want to buy the book I have put all the limericks 
          in the book on this page. There is also a big book with a bunch of formulas. 
          To start the quest for it, talk to the bartender in the Seafarer's Roost 
          in Freeport. I also have all the formulas I know for brewing listed 
          here. The next thing you need is the materials for brewing, including 
          a brew barrel. There are a couple in about every town so they shouldn't 
          be hard to find. The only place I know of right now that sells brewing 
          materials is in West Freeport. There is a girl near the militia house 
          and the entrance to North Freeport, Krystin Charcoal. To brew something, 
          click on the brew barrel and put in the materials for one of the drinks. 
          Click combine and if it works, you get the drink, if not, you don't 
          get the drink and you still lose the materials. 
        <h2 align=Center><b>Book Limericks </b></h2>
        <p align=Left> Limerick #1<br>
          When Ssra goes to move barley<br>
          he meets a girl named Darley<br>
          To the cask in the vault<br>
          He adds hops and malt<br>
          and drinks till her face isn't gnarly. 
        <p align=Left> Limerick #2<br>
          With hops, malt, and yeast<br>
          An ogre made mead for a feast<br>
          When&nbsp;his cask they did fill<br>
          Not a drop he did spill<br>
          So they cheered the ugly&nbsp;beast. 
        <p align=Left> Limerick #3<br>
          My good friend where is my cask?<br>
          Is the water too much to ask?<br>
          Deliver barley and hops<br>
          With the rest of my crops<br>
          Or your death will be my next task. 
        <p align=Left> Limerick #4<br>
          Ogre's lust for a wench named Sulock<br>
          For a date bring a cask and froglok<br>
          Malt and yeast to the barber<br>
          Get them near her harbor<br>
          And you'll hear an uproar if they dock.
