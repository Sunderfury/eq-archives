<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello, I am a human with 241 smithing skill.&nbsp; 
Using a Geerlock Hammer my skill hits the cap, giving me the best possible 
success rates.&nbsp; I also have a high Pottery and Brewing skill, both of which 
are required to make the ingredients for the final armor combines.</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial">Self Serve</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
Primarily, I will be combining the items together for people that bring them to 
me.&nbsp; Creating the armor must be done in cultural forge located in South 
Qeynos.&nbsp; All skill combines will be done there.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For every piece of armor that you wish me to 
attempt to create you must supply me with <b>at least 3 sets of
<a href="Ingredients.htm">Ingredients</a></b>.&nbsp; I charge a non-refundable 
retainer of 1,000 plat for every piece of armor you want crafted.&nbsp; I do not 
guarantee success.&nbsp; If I succeed before the third combine I get to keep the 
remaining ingredients, up to a total of 3.&nbsp; (See below for example.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Success rates for the cultural armor has been 
running between 30% and 50% on the final combine for smiths across all servers.&nbsp; 
Remember also that there are several combines before the final combine in which 
any of the ingredients (including Blue Diamond) may be lost.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">My current success rate is: 2 for 3 on bracers, 0 
for 1 on belts, 1 for 3 on breastplates for a total of 3 out of 7 attempts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If I succeed at crafting the item,  you then pay 
5,000 plat for small items and 10,000 for large items minus the original 
retainer.&nbsp; Small items are bracer, visor, gorget, boots, belt, helm, 
gauntlets, pauldrons and vambraces.&nbsp; Large items include greaves, 
breastplates and cloaks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Example:&nbsp; You want a bracer crafted and 
bring 4 sets of ingredients.&nbsp; I create the bracer on the second attempt, 
leaving 2 sets of ingredients.&nbsp; I keep one set, and return the 4th set to 
you.&nbsp; You pay 4,000 plat (5k minus 1k retainer) get the bracer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><i>Full Service<br>
</i><font size="2">I am now taking orders for items as I gather the ingredients 
myself.&nbsp; Please contact me in game to see if I have enough components to 
make the piece of armor you are looking for.&nbsp; I am currently charging the 
following rates:</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">15k - Bracer, Visor, Gorget, Boots<br>
23k - Belts, Helm, Gauntlets, Pauldrons, Vambraces<br>
30k - Greaves, Breastplates, Cloaks</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Deals can be made for bulk orders or if you are 
able to provide any of the main ingredients yourself, especially Blue Diamonds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have any questions you can either talk to 
me in game or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:bigbearfozy@yahoo.com">
