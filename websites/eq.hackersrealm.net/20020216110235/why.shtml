<div align="center"> <font size="+7" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why 
  is Mozilla Better?</font> 
  <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why should you think 
    about using Mozilla? Well first of all lots of people think Mozilla is Netscape. 
    They are dead wrong. Mozilla can be thought of as a more updated, better, 
    and open source version of Netscape. Things have changed. Lots of people try 
    comparing Netscape 4.x with Internet Explorer 5.x. Well gee, Internet Explorer 
    wins that match obviously. But when you start to compare Internet Explorer 
    5.x with Mozilla 0.9.2. The battle starts to get a bit harder for Internet 
    Explorer. The first thing most Mozilla users notice is by default it looks 
    just like old Netscape. But when you change to the latest &quot;Modern&quot; 
    theme things start to look very nice.</font></p>

    [Click to Enlarge]</p>
  <p align="left">Don't like that look? Then simply download another theme. Which 
    is another great feature. Also, it has a very nice feature to block advertisements 
    (one of the many features taken out of the Netscape version). You simply right 
    click on any image to block images from that server. This is a very nice feature 
    for those of you with 56k connections or less.</p>

    <i></nobr><br>
    Internet Explorer to the left and Mozilla to the right displaying the same 
    website. </i></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="/mozilla/mozilla_menu.png" width="242" height="452"><br>
    <i>Very easy to block advertisements</i></p>
  <p align="left">You can also selectively block cookies and remember to block 
    cookies only from certain servers, such as doubleclick.com (an advertising 
    company with a reputation for selling information it gathers by tracking users 
    with cookies). You can also view cookies and selectively delete them, and 
    even block the cookies you delete from ever coming back!</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="/mozilla/cookies.png" width="299" height="381" alt="Pick and chose what cookies you want to remove"><br>
    <i>As you can see you can view and remove the cookies you want. You can also 
    remove all of the cookies.</i></p>
  <p align="center"><img src="/mozilla/mozilla_cookie.png" width="442" height="122" alt="Don't let others track you, but be able to store preferences from sites using cookies at the same time!"><br>
    <i>This is an optional option that you can disable if it gets annoying. Clicking 
    &quot;Remember this<br>
    decision&quot; will make it always block cookies from 'www.doubleclick.com' 
    without asking you.</i></p>
  <p align="left">Once more, after you remove the cookies they are really removed. 
    Internet Explorer stores cookies and other tracking information in a hidden 
    file called index.dat, even <i>after</i> you chose to delete all cookies (<a href="http://www.fuckmicrosoft.com/content/ms-hidden-files.shtml" target="_blank">click 
    here</a> to read more). Mozilla also stores form information much like Internet 
    Explorer. Only you can enable Mozilla to fill forms automatically, you don't 
    even have to start typing your first name for it to pop-up for example. You 
    can also just double click form boxes instead to fill them in. Mozilla also 
    supports the optional ability to have different &quot;Profiles&quot;, basically 
    different identities when you start up, you can password protect your identity 
    as well. This stops other from viewing your form information, history of the 
    websites you have visited, cookies, etc...</p>
  <p align="left">Mozilla also has a nice feature of being able to notify you 
    when a website has been updated:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="/mozilla/mozilla_updates.png" width="330" height="344"></p>
  <p align="left">For web developers, Mozilla supports the recommended w3c set 
    HTML/CSS/CSS2 standards better then any other browser currently available. 
    There are also nice CSS features. Such as the ability to have different colors 
    for objects when the mouse is over them (like MSIE first used, but not just 
    for links). You can also be more specific with the types of objects you want 
    to have styles for. For example if you only want the password fields in the 
    form to have a certain style you just use <code>input[type=&quot;password&quot;] 
    </code>there is no way to specify anything but <code>input </code>with Internet 
    Explorer. You can also have different colors for items that are active or 
    have the mouse hovering over them for everything. Take this example from the 
    Linux.com style sheet:</p>
  <p><font size="-1" color="#000000"><code>input[type=&quot;submit&quot;] { background-color: 
    #ccc; color: #555; margin: 1px; border: 1px solid #777;}<br>
    </code></font><font color="#000000" size="-1"><code>input[type=&quot;submit&quot;]:hover 
    { background-color: #eee; color: #36c; }<br>
    input[type=&quot;submit&quot;]:active { background-color: #eee; color: #9ac; 
    }<br>
    div input[type=&quot;text&quot;], input[type=&quot;password&quot;], textarea 
    { background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #777; }<br>
    input[type=&quot;submit&quot;] { background-color: #ccc; color: #555; margin: 
    1px; border: 1px solid #777; }<br>
    input[type=&quot;submit&quot;]:hover { background-color: #eee; color: #36c; 
    }<br>
    input[type=&quot;submit&quot;]:active { background-color: #eee; color: #9ac; 
    }<br>
    div input[type=&quot;text&quot;], input[type=&quot;password&quot;], textarea 
    { background-color: #eee; border: 1px solid #777; }</code></font></p>
  <p align="left">This means when you click on a text input field the background 
    color turns from gray to white. Or when you hover your mouse over a button 
    it makes the background of the button turn from dark gray to light gray and 
    the text turns blue.</p>
  <p align="left">Mozilla also seems a lot faster. I have not done any benchmarks, 
    but it seems that pages load faster then they do with Internet Explorer, or 
    Opera (Opera is much much faster then any browser when I am in Linux though, 
    the Windows version is just a lot slower for some reason) even</p>
