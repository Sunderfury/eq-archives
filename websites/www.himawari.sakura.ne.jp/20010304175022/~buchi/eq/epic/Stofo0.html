Stofo Olan Log<BR>
<BR>
You say, 'hail Stofo Olan'<BR>
Stofo Olan says 'Good day, I have discovered something truly wonderful!<BR>
 If I only had the materials required so I can copy my notes and send them to my teacher.<BR> 
<BR>
You say, 'What materials?'<BR> 
Stofo Olan says 'The materials I need are a mechanical pen, ink of the dark, and white paper.<BR>
 Bring me those and I will give you a copy of this information.'<BR>
<BR>
You say, 'What ink of the dark?'<BR>
Stofo Olan says 'Dark illusions, thievery, and the plague of the living will guide you.<BR>
 These are the only hints I can provide. Safe travels and may you be protected from all maladies.<BR> 
<BR>
You say, 'what white paper?'<BR>
Stofo Olan says 'It may seem like ordinary paper at first. However, this paper was enchanted<BR>
 by a friend of mine. This paper was given to a lass in the Karanas to help with her writings.<BR>
 The paper will guide her hands and draw forth the thoughts in her mind. I no longer have any<BR>
 and I have not had contact with my friend in some time. Search them out. <BR>
<BR>
You say, 'where mechanical pen?'<BR>
Stofo Olan says 'The answer you seek is in your question. If you are unable to figure it out,<BR>
 then perhaps you are not ready to travel along this path.<BR> 
<BR>
You say, 'Who is your teacher?'<BR>
Stofo Olan says 'My teacher is Jeb Lumsed. He was last seen in the regions of the<BR>
 newly discovered lands. If you wish to find him that is where you must seek him out.<BR> 
<BR>
You say, 'What did you discover?'<BR>
Stofo Olan says 'I was researching a new spell, and discovered new information concerning<BR>
 the history of the Serpent. <BR>
<BR>
<B>[Ink of the Dark], [White Paper], [Mechanical Pen]を渡します</B><BR>
Stofo Olan says 'Yes, that is what I wanted.  Here, take these notes.<BR>
 My teacher will be very interested if he is shown what I have found. <BR>
Your faction standing with TrueSpirit got better<BR>
