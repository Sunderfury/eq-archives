<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>We have released a patch that includes files necessary for the implementation of our language localization efforts. The files contained in the patch do not affect the UO client.exe file and will not affect gameplay. 
<P>
We will be publishing a mini-update to the servers today. This publish will be active on the shards after they return from their next scheduled maintenance. In addition to the holiday tickets listed in <a href="http://update.uo.com/next.html">Testing for the Next Update</a>, the following will also be in this publish:<ul><li>NPCs will no longer scavenge items.<li>Monsters will no longer destroy objects that block their path.<li>You will no longer be able to place locked down items into your backpack.</ul>All of these changes will be added to <a href="http://update.uo.com/latest.html">Latest Game Updates</a> after the publish is active on all shards. </I>

I see this publish as a way to eliminate one possible reason for unwanted item decay in houses (trashing NPCs).

Some short updates were posted about Item Decay on <a href="http://update.uo.com/general.html">General Testing</a>. Also, Phase III will not be published before the end of the year.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
The final phase in the Clean Up Britannia program will be the implementation of item decay in houses. The decay rate will be the same as with items outside.
<br><br>
Once in effect, house item decay will affect all items that are not: 
<ul>
<li>Placed in a secure container. 
<li>Locked down. 
<li>A house add-on (such as an anvil or a loom).
<li>Placed by an IGM or GM.
</ul>
<br><br><br>
We will be activating decay for items left on the deck of a boat.  These items will decay at the same rate as items left on the ground outside.
<br><br>
Only items left on the deck of a boat will decay, items in the hold of a boat will <b>not</b> be subject to decay.

This is from <a href="http://update.uo.com/next.html">Testing for next Update</a> about Xmas tickets and gifts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
Players will receive tickets when logging in their characters. Any ticket can be matched to any other player's ticket. Once a ticket is used on another ticket, each player can select from a variety of holiday gifts, compliments of Origin. The tickets are blessed, meaning they cannot be looted or stolen. In addition, each ticket can only be used by the original owner of the ticket.
<br><br>
<b>Matching Tickets</b><br>
To use the tickets, simply open a trade window. Once one ticket is in the window, you do not need to actually agree to the trade. Double-click on your ticket and target the player’s ticket in the trade window. You will then be given a window from which to select your gift. You do not need to actually give your ticket to another player to use them.
<br><br>
<b>The Gifts</b><br>
All of the gifts are blessed.  They cannot be looted or stolen.  As with all blessed items it is important to leave the item in your main backpack.  Placing a blessed gift in a container inside your backpack will make the item susceptible to thieves as they can steal the container with the blessed item inside.
<ul>
<li>Snowballs
<ul>
<li>Selecting the snowballs will place a snow pile in your backpack.  To throw a snowball at another player, double-click the snow pile and target a player.  Only players who have a snow pile in their backpack can be targeted in this manner.  You will receive a message if the targeted player is not a valid target.  
<li>There is a delay as to how often you can throw a snowball from the snow pile.  
<li>The snow piles have unlimited uses.
</ul>
<li>Potted Plants
<ul>
<li>Selecting the potted plant will place a potted plant deed in your backpack.  
<li>To get your plant, double-click the deed and target the ground.  This will create one of five random potted plants.
<li>Once placed the plant can be picked up and carried.
<li>Potted plants need to be locked down after Phase III of Clean Up Britannia begins.
<li>Although the potted plant deed is blessed, the plant itself is not.
</ul>
<li>Fireworks Wand
<ul>
<li>The fireworks wand will shoot fireworks when double-clicked.
<li>The wand has 100 charges.
</ul>
<li>Clothing Bless Deed
<ul>
<li>Selecting the clothing bless deed will place a deed in your backpack.
<li>The deed can be used on any article of clothing (such as tunics, boots, hats, etc.)
<li>After double-clicking the deed, target an article of clothing.  Once targeted, the clothing will become blessed (meaning it cannot be stolen or looted).
<li>Blessed clothing can still take damage (from maces for example).
</ul>
<li>Wristwatch
<ul>
<li>Selecting the wristwatch will place a watch in your backpack.
<li>The watch will tell the time in Britannia, which can be very useful when using the moongates.
</ul>
<li>Holiday Tree Deed
<ul>
<li>Selecting the Holiday Tree Deed will place a deed in your backpack.
<li>To place the tree in your house, double-click the deed and target the spot where you want to place it.
<li>Holiday Trees cannot be placed within three tiles of your front door and cannot be placed outside.
<li>Holiday Trees do not need to be locked down once Phase III of Clean Up Britannia is published.
</ul>
</ul>

For details and instructions on these features, please visit <a href="http://www.uo.com/news.html">What’s New</a>.The following backups are scheduled to be placed on Test Center beginning today:<p>

Tuesday, December 14 - Great Lakes<BR>
Wednesday, December 15 - Asuka<BR>
Thursday, December 16 - Atlantic<BR>
Friday, December 17 - Pacific<p>

This was posted on <a href="http://update.uo.com/fyi.html">FYI</a> about Phase III (Item decay in houses):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
The final phase of the Clean Up Britannia program is fast approaching.  The Clean-up Britannia program was designed to reduce the backup times for the shards, reduce time-warps, and provide an improved gaming experience overall.  <p>The first phase of Clean Up Britannia was the Ticket System.  For two weeks, from October 15th to October 29th (CST) players were rewarded with tickets for placing items into special ticket barrels.  These tickets could then be redeemed for unique and rare items such as special hair dyes, statuettes of monsters, and furniture dye tubs.  Many of these items are proudly displayed in houses throughout the lands of Britannia.  Due to enthusiastic player participation, the ticket system was a huge success.  Shard restart times were in some cases reduced by over 30%, allowing us to move toward our goal of halving maintenance downtime across the shards.<p>The next phase involved changing the way secure and lock down containers worked.  Some house types were given additional secure containers and lock down totals to allow players to keep their most valuable and useful items.  To further allow players to store items, the weight restrictions from bank boxes and secure containers were removed, allowing players to store a full 125 items in them.  As a final enhancement, co-owners were added to the housing system.  Each house can now have up to eight co-owners. These co-owners can place strongboxes that allow them to store up to 25 items per strongbox, for a total of 200 additional items per house.  These changes went into effect on November 23rd (CST).  For more information about the specifics of secure containers and lock down numbers, <a href="http://update.uo.com/cgi-bin/cycle.pl?id=37">click here</a>.<p>The final phase of Clean Up Britannia is activating decay in houses for items that are not in a secure container or locked down.  This decay will act in the same manner as decay outside of a house.  <b>Therefore, it is VERY important that you begin organizing your items into secure containers 
or locking them down.  The phase III change could come as early as this weekend, so reorganize your house NOW!</b>  Once phase III of Clean Up Britannia is published to the shards, anything not in a secure container or locked down will decay.  To read more about house item decay, <br><a href="http://update.uo.com/cgi-bin/cycle.pl?id=52">click here</a>.<p>Keep an eye on this section of the uo.com site, we will be announcing the target date for Phase III at a future date.

So, check your houses, when your shard is mirrored on Test Center!

You need to download the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.owo.com/pub/uo/client/coolfix/cliloc-1.enu">latest language file ( cliloc-1.enu )</a> which will turn those Error [TID]: null string messages into sensible messages. Please note that this file will fix your problem whether you are using a test client or not. There does seem to still be a problem with the test client displaying those error messages even once you have the language file but eventually it clears itself up.<br>
