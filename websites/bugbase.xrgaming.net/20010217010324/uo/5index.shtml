This is new in Testing for Next Update:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
Guild Stones will be modified to enhance their functionality and efficiency.  The system that controls Guild Stones has been modified to facilitate future enhancements.  While most of these changes will be transparent to the players, there will also be some changes to the guild interface at the same time.
<br><br>
<b>The War Menu</b><br>
The War Menu will have a new option in the main menu of the Guild Stone.  It can only be accessed by the Guild Master.  The menu has the following options:
<ul>
<li>Declare war by name
<ul>
<li>The Guild Master will be able to enter the name of the opposing guild.  
<li>The system will do a name lookup and try to pull a match or a close match.  
<li>The Guild Master will then be given a display of the matches and close matches to the name entered. 
<li>Choosing one of the names on this list will send a war invitation to that guild.
<li>A guild may only have up to 12 wars declared and not accepted at any given time.
<ul>
<li>Once a war is accepted by the other guild, the Guild Master may declare another war if he chooses to.
</ul></ul>
<li>Accept War invitations (if any exist)
<ul>
<li>A menu will be displayed allowing the Guild Master to accept any war invitations they currently have.
<li>A guild many only have up to 12 wars declared on them and not accepted.
<ul>
<li>If a 13th war is declared on the guild, the first invitation will be scrolled off the list.
<li>There is no limit to the total number of wars a guild may take part in.
</ul></ul>
<li>Decline War invitations (if any exist)
<ul>
<li>A menu will be displayed allowing the Guild Master to decline any war invitations they currently have.
</ul>
<li>Rescind War declarations (if any exist)
<ul>
<li>A menu will be displayed allowing the Guild Master to take back any war invitations they sent to other guilds.
</ul>
<li>Sue for peace (if any wars exist)
<ul>
<li>A menu will be displayed with all of the guilds the Guild Master’s guild is currently at war with.  The Guild Master can then choose to stop the war using this option.
</ul>
</ul>
<b>Recruiting</b><br>
Guild Masters who recruit guild members will no longer have to accept them.  If a Guild Master selects a member for candidacy, that member will be accepted automatically.
<br><br>
<b>Auto-cleanup</b><br>
Characters in guilds that no longer exist will now be “cleaned up” and able to join other guilds automatically.

These tiems are new in "Testing for next Update":
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
<b>Skill and Stat Advancement Changes</b>
<p>
Advancement in “non-difficulty” based skills at higher levels and advancement in stats will be improved.  The effect of this change will result in fewer required uses of the skill to advance it at high levels and better, more evenly curved stat gains.
<br><br>
The following skills will be affected by the modification to skill advancement:
<ul>
<li>Anatomy
<li>Animal Lore
<li>Item Identification
<li>Arms Lore
<li>Begging
<li>Evaluate Intelligence
<li>Spirit Speak
<li>Hiding
<li>Tracking
<li>Camping
<li>Cooking
<li>Musicianship
<li>Lockpicking
<li>Mining
<li>Lumberjacking
<li>Peacemaking
<li>Provocation
<li>Enticement
<li>Cartography
<li>Fishing
</ul>
Stat advancement will now raise at a more constant, consistent rate.  All skills will raise their appropriate stats (including combat skills) and you will be able to gain stats consistently regardless of the level of the skill, rather than only when reaching a high level in that skill.
<br><br>
Each skill will raise its appropriate stats.  For skills that raise multiple stats, some stats are weighted more heavily than others.  Therefore, stat gains from skills such as these will be based on how much weight is given to the individual stats. For instance, Anatomy will raise INT more often, though it still has a chance to raise STR and DEX.
<p>
<b>Dexterity and Healing</b>
<p>
In an effort to balance the Healing skill with other methods of healing damage (such as healing potions and the greater heal spell), dexterity will affect the delay for healing and the penalty for finger slips while healing.  
<ul>
<li>The higher a character’s dexterity, the less time it will take to complete a heal.
<li>The amount of healing a character loses due to a finger slip will be reduced with a higher dexterity.
</ul>
These changes are true for healing both yourself and other players.

This was posted by Runesabre on the Crossroads Dev Board:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Test Center will be restarting with the latest changes for the way Stats and non-difficulty based skills advance.
<P>
The new stat advancement changes should make any skill a viable skill for raising a its associated stats ( as opposed to having to resort to snooping for dex because fencing didn't raise you any dex as an example ). 
<P>
I was not happy with the way my original changes worked for making non-difficulty based skills advance better at the upper levels ( bizarre results like failing at higher levels when you normally wouldn't have making getting to GM not worth it ) so I have reworked how I am handling those skills. Please check those skills out ( Anatomy, Evaluate Intelligence, Mining, Lumberjacking, Arms Lore, Musicianship, etc ) even if you already tried them before on Test Center.
<P>
Please email me your results and findings and any odd behaviors you experience with the latest changes to stat and skill advancement.

Some new things have been moved from In Development to <a href="http://update.uo.com/next.html">Testing for next Update</a>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>NPC and monster changes:
<P>
Changes will be made to various NPCs and Monsters that will have the following affects:
<BR>
<ul>
<BR>
<li>NPCs will now train the appropriate skills when asked. Some NPCs will now train different skills than they previously and will list all skills they can train when asked, “train”
<BR>
<li>You will no longer get the item “a scroll”.
<BR>
<li>Monster treasure will be revamped. Most monsters will not carry backpacks, and some monsters will carry different treasure than they have previously. 
<BR>
<li>Provisioners, beekeepers, and innkeepers will sell beeswax.
<BR>
<li>Some NPCs will now carry items more appropriate to their jobs (beware of merchants with trapped boxes!)
<BR>
</ul>
<P>
Pack Horses:
<P>
Pack horses will have their carrying capacity increased from 400 to 1,600 stones. If a pack horse goes wild, it will eventually drop whatever it is carrying if it is not retamed. 
<P>
Land Surveying Tool:
<P>
This tool will allow players to check land without have to buy a house deed, thus allowing multiple people in a group to search different locations. To use the tool:
<BR>
<ul>
<BR>
<li>Double-click the surveying tool.
<BR>
<li>A window will appear listing the different house types. Click the house type you wish to check.
<BR>
<li>A small description of the house type and the number of lockdowns it can hold will appear. 
<BR>
<li>To evaluate the area, click the “E” in the window.
<BR>
<li>The house type you selected will appear in front of you. Move the house to the location you want to test and singe-click.
<BR>
<li>You will receive a message telling you whether the area can hold that house type.
<BR>
<ul>
<BR>
<li>If the area is acceptable, a temporary house of the type you selected will appear for approximately 10 seconds to let you see what a house would look like in that location.
<BR>
<li>If the area is not acceptable, then you will simply receive a message telling you that the house type will not fit.
<BR>
</ul></ul>
<P>
Various Fixes:
<P>
<ul>
<BR>
<li>A fix for the exploit involving banning summoned pets or creatures so they will attack passersby. 
<BR>
<li>An issue with trading and using ingots through trade windows will be resolved. 
<BR>
<li>You will not be able to snoop pack animals inside a house, while the animal was outside.
<BR>
<li>You will no longer be able to use the stealing skill to determine if someone is in the thieves’ guild.
<BR>
<li>Issues with smithing difficulty being higher than normal will be resolved.
<BR>
</ul>
<P>
Pre-Casting:
<P>
The bug involving the ability to “pre-cast” spells and then use or take items will be fixed. After casting a spell, the targeting cursor will disappear if the player does any of the following:
<BR>
<ul>
<BR>
<li>Equips or unequips an item.
<BR>
<li>Takes an item.
<BR>
<li>Drags an item from their backpack.
<BR>
</ul>
<P>
Grey Flagging Fix:
<P>
To avoid exploits involving “gray” to “blue” flagging, entering or being the target of combat will extend the “gray flag” of a “gray” character for two additional minutes.
<P>
Monster Spawn:
<P>
Monsters in invalid or unreachable locations will “die” after a certain amount of time. Monsters will be eligible for “death”, within a given amount of time, under the following circumstances:
<BR>
<ul>
<BR>
<li>If the monster is not targeted.
<BR>
<li>If the monster does not receive or deliver damage.
<BR>
</ul>
<P>
Fealty Calculation:
<P>
The fealty calculation for guildstones will be made more efficient to alleviate the delay in shard start-up times.
<P>
Cleanup Britannia Phase III:
<P>
The final phase in the Clean Up Britannia program will be the implementation of item decay in houses. The decay rate will be the same as with items outside.
<P>
Once in effect, house item decay will affect all items that are not: 
<BR>
<ul>
<BR>
<li>Placed in a secure container. 
<BR>
<li>Locked down. 
<BR>
<li>A house add-on (such as an anvil or a loom).
<BR>
<li>Placed by an IGM or GM.
<BR>
</ul>
<P>
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
From Calandryll, the Land Survey Tool should be available from provisoners, but the NPCs have not yet been updated.
<p>
Also from Calandryll: One minor correction. The gray flagging fix will not be in the next update and is not currently in testing. It is still in development at this time. My apologies for any confusion this may have caused.
<P>
Happy testing!

Runesabre posted this on the Dev Board regarding one possible reason for item trashing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
Well, actually there were two things that tipped me off as to the NPCs taking stuff. During the time you couldn't keep anything in your house, I noticed someone posted on Stratics something about how he just saw an NPC walk by outside his house and took his picture hanging on the wall. Then I went and visited your place where you said you couldn't keep anything from decaying and noticed 3 NPCs swarming around your house. *chuckles* <p>
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
As usual, if you think this can't be the reason in your case, protest on the Dev Board!

Due to an exploit, we have had to turn off some of the house sign functions. We have removed the ability to transfer a house and the ability to demolish the house back into a deed.

This was posted on <a href="http://update.uo.com/concept.html">In Conept</a> about the way how stablemasters work:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
In an effort to allow more players to store animals on stable masters, and to cut down on the hoarding of rare and difficult-to-find animals, stable masters will be going through the following revisions:
<ul>
<li>Each stable master will have approximately 150 "slots."
<li>Each animal will take up a different number of slots depending on how difficult it is to tame.  The easiest animals will take up one slot, while the most difficult will take up four.
<li>Since each animal will take up a certain number of slots, the actual number of animals each stable master can hold will be dependent on the types of animals players store.
<li>Characters will be allowed to use up to six default slots to store animals
<li>The cost of stabling an animal will be dependent on how difficult it is to tame.
<ul><li>The more difficult an animal is, the more gold the animal costs to stable. This cost is 20 gold * slots squared per pet.
</ul>
<ul><li>A pet may cause players to exceed the six slot limit.  For example, if you have one slot available of the six, you may stable a pet that requires more than one slot. If a pet causes a player to exceed the six slot limit, the additional cost will be 250 gold per slot beyond six.  Players may not stable additional pets if they have six slots filled.
</ul>	
<li>When asking the stable master to retrieve a pet, players may ask for the pet specifically by name. If you cannot remember the names of your pets, you may ask the request to "claim" a pet without specifying a name.  The stable master will then list all of your currently stabled pets.
<ul><li>The stable master will release any pets bearing the same name. Thus, if you own six pets named "Ed", and you attempt to retrieve one, the stable master will release all pets.
</ul>
<ul><li>When claiming any pet, the stable master will automatically collect any gold due if the pet has been stabled for more than a week. If the player does not have enough money on his person or in his bank box, the pet will not be released.
</ul>
<ul><li>You may elect to retrieve all of your pets at the same time by using the "claim all" command.
</ul>
<li>If you have more than six total slots (from pets stabled prior to this change, for instance) and attempt to claim pets from a stable master, he will tell you that you are currently over your limit.  This will result in a fee that will be assessed in the following ways:
<ul><li>If you keep the pets on the stable master, he will charge you for each slot above six each time you claim a single pet.  Payment will be taken automatically from the character or directly from the character's bankbox.
</ul>
<ul><li>To avoid the fee, you must claim all pets. 
</ul>
<ul><li>If the character does not have enough gold to pay the fee, he may only claim all pets, and not individual ones. If the player chooses not to pay this fee, no pets will be released, and the stable master will remove the pets after four weeks in the stables.
</ul>
<ul><li>The fee for being over the limit will be assessed on a per-slot basis.

<li>Stable masters will now allow your pets to stay up to four weeks without being refreshed.  They will require one week advance payment and will charge the remainder when you retrieve the pet, or they will release the pet at the end of four weeks.
