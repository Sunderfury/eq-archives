This was posted on <a href="http://update.uo.com/fyi.html">FYI</a>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
In the near future, modern houses that do not conform with the <a href="http://guide.uo.com/house_0.html">house placement rules</a> listed on the Ultima Online website will lose certain functionality, and may become subject to further restrictions in the future as well.  While these houses will not be deleted, improperly placed houses will not have access to all of the features that other houses have.  The exact nature of these restrictions will be posted at a later date and we recommend that you keep reading the Ultima Online website for more information.  Modern houses placed using a bug, placed completely off of the ground, in illegal locations such as those placed on top of other buildings, on top of hedges or trees, and inside or blocking interest points (such as dungeons, graveyards, etc.) may still be subject to deletion. We reserve the right to delete any future houses placed using exploits or bugs.
<br><br>
We have published the shards with an update that will let all players determine if a house is improperly placed.  You can now determine if a house is improperly placed by double-clicking the house sign.  Owners, co-owners, and friends of the house will receive a message on the bottom of the house sign window letting them know whether the house is properly placed or not.  Other players may also double-click the house sign and will receive a red message in the lower left corner of their screen.  There are four possible messages:
<ul>
<li><b>Classic design and properly placed:</b> These houses meet the house placement rules and will not have any restrictions on them.
<li><b>Modern design and properly placed:</b> These houses meet the house placement rules and will not have any restrictions on them.
<li><b>Classic design and improperly placed:</b> Although these houses do not meet the house placement rules, they were placed before the housing patch.  These houses will not have any restrictions on them. However, if you redeed a classic, improperly placed house you will not be able to place another house in that location.
<li><b>Modern design and improperly placed:</b> These houses do not meet the house placement rules.  Although these houses will not be subject to deletion, they will lose certain functionality. 
</ul>
We strongly recommend that, before agreeing to purchase a house from another player, you visit it and use this method to ensure that it is properly placed, or that you know it is ‘improperly placed’ and you are not concerned about upcoming restrictions.  Again, modern houses that are defined as ‘improperly placed’ are not subject to deletion, but they will be subject to restricted functionality in the future.  All buyers and homeowners should make themselves aware of the newest information available on these subjects by referring to the Ultima Online website.

These things are now <a href="http://update.uo.com/indev.html">In Development</a>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
<b>Secure Pet Trading</b>
<p>Secure pet trading will allow players to sell or trade items for tamed animals and monsters using the trade window.
<br><br>
To trade a pet to another player the owner of the pet can:
<ul>
<li>Speak the words, “[pet name] Transfer”
<li>A targeting cursor will appear.  The pet owner can then target the person they wish to transfer the pet to.
<li>A trade window will automatically appear.
<ul>
<li>The trade window will contain a deed in the current owner’s portion of the window.  This deed will display the pet type and the pet’s name.
<li>The other player may then place gold (or other items) into his portion of the window.
<li>Once both participants have clicked the gems to agree to the trade, the pet will automatically be transferred to the new owner and the deed will delete itself.
<li>If the transfer is cancelled, the deed deletes itself and all other items are returned to their owner.
</ul></ul>
We will also be making changes to the secure trading window to account for the amount and weight of items used in transfers and to stop any scams associated with the trade window.  Information on this enhancement will be forthcoming.
<p><b>Secure House Trading</b>
<p>Secure house trading will allow players to sell or trade items for houses using the trade window.
<br><br>
To trade a house to another player the owner of the house can:
<ul>
<li>Click the “transfer” button in the house options menu.
<li>A targeting cursor will appear.  The house owner can then target the person they wish to transfer the house to.
<li>A trade window will automatically appear.
<ul>
<li>The trade window will contain a deed in the current owner’s portion of the window.  This deed is not an actual house deed, but will display the name of the house, the house type, and the sextant coordinates of the house’s location.
<li>The other player may then place gold (or other items) into his portion of the window.
<li>Once both participants have clicked the gems to agree to the trade, the house will automatically be transferred to the new owner and the deed will delete itself.
<li>If the transfer is cancelled, the deed deletes itself and all other items are returned to their owner.
</ul>
<li>You will not be able to transfer a house to a character that already owns a house using this method.
</ul>
We will also be making changes to the secure trading window to account for the amount and weight of items used in transfers and to stop any scams associated with the trade window.  Information on this enhancement will be forthcoming.
<p><b>Invulnerable Shopkeepers</b>
<p>Shopkeepers will become “invulnerable” and will not take any damage from attacks.
<p><b>Animal and Monster Spawn Phase II</b>
<p>Untamed monsters and animals in houses will “die” after a certain amount of time. These monsters and animals will be eligible for “death”, within a given amount of time, under the following circumstances: 
<ul>
<li>If the monster/animal is not targeted. 
<li>If the monster/animal does not receive or deliver damage.
</ul>
<p><b>Dexterity and Healing</b>
<p>In an effort to balance the Healing skill with other methods of healing damage (such as healing potions and the greater heal spell), dexterity will affect the delay for healing and the penalty for finger slips while healing.  
<ul>
<li>The higher a character’s dexterity, the less time it will take to complete a heal.
<li>The amount of healing a character loses due to a finger slip will be reduced with a higher dexterity.
</ul>
These changes are true for healing both yourself and other players.
<p><b>Instant-Resurrection Removal</b>
<p>Following the creation of “Young” player status, the ability to “instantly resurrect” is no longer necessary. After dying, you will automatically return as a ghost.

</I>

These changes were announced:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
Changes to taming animals and monsters will be made to fix some outstanding issues.
<br><br>
The Taming changes include the following:
<ul>
<li>A fix for pet commands including the “pet friend bug”. 
<li>Saying “stop” to your pet will clear any previous commands.
<li>Pets will remember who their previous owners were.  Previous owners are defined as anyone who tames the pet or has the pet transferred to them.
<ul>
<li>The more previous owners a pet has had, the more difficult it will be for other players to tame it if it goes wild.  This also means that players who were not a previous owner to the pet can tame the pet for skill gain.
<li>Any previous owner may retame the pet regardless of their skill.
</ul>
<li>Pets that go wild will become more difficult to control.  This change will affect both previous and new owners.
<li>If line-of-site is broken during the taming process, the attempt will automatically fail.
<li>When transferring a pet to another player, the previous owner and the new owner will now receive the proper confirmation messages.
<li>Pets will now only guard their owner’s corpse.
<li>Fixes for various messages with relation to pet commands.
Tamers who give commands to their pets that the pet does not follow will find that their pets will go wild faster than previously.

This is from <a href="http://www.uo.com/news.html">What's new</a>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
If you’re interested in helping test new changes and systems for Ultima Online, we’d like to recommend a visit to the Test Center shard.  Test Center is constantly being used to test a variety of enhancements, and is available from your shard login screen.  <br><br> In addition to advance access to new game features and changes, Test Center also hosts some recently added features designed to enhance your testing experience.  These features include:<ul><li>10,000 gold waiting in the bank for each new character. <li>Reagents and a full spellbook (also in your bank box).<li>Set your own stats and skills.  Say ‘Help’ in game for details on how to set your own stats and skills.</ul>In the near future, we will be recruiting UO Testers for an incentive program designed to thank players for helping us improve the world of UO.  Members of this program will be chosen by Ultima Online Quality Assurance based on the active use of Test Center to find bugs, and consistent and effective reporting of new bugs.  <br><br>If you are interested in participating in this incentive program, the first step is to become progressively involved in using Test Center. You can do this by watching the <a href="http://update.uo.com/next.html">In Testing</a> section of our website to keep up-to-date on the latest changes currently in testing, then log in to Test Center and start trying to break them!  Try anything, try everything.  Test Center is a world we want you to do your best to abuse.<br><br>Second, you’ll need to submit bug reports to the QA Team in an efficient and timely manner.  Bug reports should contain the following information:<ul><li>Client Version Number.  This is located at the bottom of the main UO login screen.<li>Server Name<li>Detailed Bug Description<li>Steps to Repeat Bug</ul>It is extremely important to include the necessary steps to recreate a bug, thus allowing the QA Team to promptly review it.  We do recommend that you try to be as concise as possible when sending in reports as well.  Try to tell us only those steps that were necessary to activate the bug.<br><br>Completed bug reports can be sent via email to <a href="mailto:tcbugs@uo.com">TCBugs@uo.com</a>. We look forward to working with you!

Holiday Trees will be deactivated in the next publish. This was posted on <a href="http://update.uo.com/fyi.html">FYI</a>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
In addition to the features currently in <a href="http://update.uo.com/next.html">Testing for the Next Update</a>, the upcoming publish will also deactivate holiday trees.  The deactivation process will work in the following manner:<ul><li>After the publish is updated and active on the shards, all existing trees will turn back to deeds.  These deeds will <b>not</b> decay with the implementation of House Item Decay.<li>Players will no longer be able to place holiday trees.</ul>Players are encouraged to deed their holiday trees as soon as possible and to store the deed in a secure location.  While the deeds will not decay, they can be picked up by anyone in the house.

So its time to deed your trees, especially in public houses!

This was now posted about the new house placing rules:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
A new system has been created to ensure that houses are not placed outside of the house placement rules.  The system will do thorough checks when attempting to place a house.
<br><br>
The house placement system includes the following:
<ul>
<li>Various checks to ensure the house meets the housing requirements, including whether it is on level ground.
<li>Provides the ability to preview an area with the deed to see if the area is valid.
<ul>
<li>Once a position is chosen, you will be told whether the area is a valid location or not.
<li>If the area is valid, you will be asked if you wish to place the house.
<li>If the area is not valid, you will be given a message telling you why not and you will not be able to place the house in that location.
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
I especially like the more detailed fail message.
