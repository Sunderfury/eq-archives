I was not looking at any packs nor were either of us able to find on within radar range using the [ or ] keys. Now, ok, let's try and close it. Nope, no luck there either. Ok, so I'll go into war mode and lose it that way. Nope. the Hot keys opened up behind the looting screen. Repeated attempts to close it, get rid of it, all failed.
