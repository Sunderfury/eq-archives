<a href="http://update.uo.com/next.html">Testing for Next Update</a> has a lot of new items:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><b>Various Fixes And Changes</b>
<P>
A problem with players crashing when placing houses near server “boundaries” has been fixed.
<P>
Holiday trees will be changed in the following manner:
<BR>
<ul><li>Holiday trees that exist in tree form will automatically redeed themselves. The tree deed can only be picked up by the deed owner or the house owner (deed owner is the character that placed the tree originally). 
<BR>
<li>The tree deed will decay in seven days if not picked up by the house owner or deed owner. No other characters can pick up the tree deed, until the house owner or deed owner has picked the deed up. 
<BR>
<li>Holiday tree deeds no longer function to allow placement of a holiday tree, until reactivated again.
<BR>
</ul>
<BR>
Localization changes have been added.
<P>
Stablemasters have been fixed to sell the correct creatures. A bug has been fixed with stablemasters and their pricing. This bugfix will result in higher prices for creatures sold by the Stablemasters.
<P>
A change has been added to the tutorial, requiring new accounts to enter the tutorial at least once. After this initial entry, players will be able to exit the tutorial as desired. New players will also be able to review parts of the tutorial at will, via the help selection menu.
<P>
A bug with runebooks not closing properly upon a player’s death has been fixed. This caused runebooks after the death to fail to open.
<P>
<b>Faction Trap Changes</b>
<P>
Faction traps will be modified in the following manner:
<BR>
<ul><li>Faction traps will award silver to their placer when they successfully damage or kill an enemy faction member. 
<BR>
<li>The silver being awarded will come from the victim, and will be subject to existing silver-award eligibility. Thus, the placer will not receive any silver from opponents not eligible to award silver. 
<BR>
<li>The trap will award 20 coins for damaging an enemy, and 40 coins for killing an enemy.
<BR>
</ul>
<BR>
Faction Trap Removal Tool
<P>
Faction tinkers will be able to create a faction-trap removal tool. This tool will be necessary to remove faction traps set by enemy factions. The tool will function in the following manners:
<BR>
<ul><li>The tool will appear within the tinker creation window, if the character is qualified and carrying the necessary materials to make the tool (500 silver, master or greater tinkering skill, and 10 ingots). 
<BR>
<li>The tool will have 25 uses, decreasing upon either success or failure to disarm the trap. The tool must be in the base level of the player’s backpack to function.
</ul>
<P>
<b>Good Creatures Attack Evil Karma</b>
<P>
Creatures of “good” alignment will react aggressively toward players with negative karma. These new creatures are specifically being introduced with the release of Third Dawn. 
<P>
<b>Player Owned Vendor Changes</b>
<P>
Player-owned vendors will be able to give the gold they are holding to their owners in bank check form if the amount is between 4999 gold and 1 million gold. If the gold amount being held for the player by the vendor is between 4999 and 1 million gold, the vendor will hand this to the owner in the form of a bank check (as long as the vendor is actually carrying this amount). If the amount is less equal to or less then 4999 gold then the vendor will hand the owner the amount in gold form. If the gold held by the vendor is more than 1 million gold, the vendor will retain the amount over 1 million gold until the next request for gold is made by the player.
<P>
Player-owned vendors will give a more accurate description of their gold and payment status.
<P>
Player owned vendors will properly “clean up” from a player-owned house, if they are removed from that house. This fixes a bug that caused player owned houses to sometimes refuse re-deeding even when empty.
<P>
<b>Item Identification Window</b>
<P>
Information regarding an item’s magical or exceptional properties will now be displayed in a separate window. This separate window will allow for easier viewing of the item’s properties by players.
<P>
The information display window will function in the following manner:
<BR>
<ul><li>When a player clicks on a magical or exceptional item they will get generic text describing the item, such as “magic longsword”. 
<BR>
<li>To the left of the text will be a blue button that will allow the player to get extended information. 
<BR>
<li>To the right of the text will be a brief numeric display of the basic four attributes. Something such as: “[Damage:Defense:Durability:Skill]” would look like “[9:0:5:10]”. 
<BR>
<li>Each of these categories will be color coded to quickly identify the basic properties. 
<BR>
<li>When the player clicks the blue dot (refer to above) extended information will be shown below the text being displayed. 
<BR>
<li>This extended information will have category information and provide more detail, such as weapon effects and charge info. 
<BR>
<li>This extended information will only show attributes that the item has, whereas the quick display at the end of the text will always show Damage, Defense, Durability, and Skill. They will be 0 on the quick display if not applicable, but will not show up at all on the extended info.
<BR>
</ul>
<BR>
Note: The Damage, Defense, Durability and Skill data will also be color coded here as well to reinforce the colors associated with the base attributes.
<P>
If an item has not been identified, the quick display will appear as question marks: “[?:?:?:?]” and the player will not have access to the extended info until he has identified the item.
<P>
<b>House Decoration Tool</b>
<P>
Players will be able to use a House Decoration Tool to assist them with the decoration of their houses within UO. The tool has the following abilities:
<BR>
<ul><li>The tool will be sold on Architect NPC’s 
<BR>
<li>The tool has the ability to turn certain objects to face south-to-east, or east-to-south. An example of an object that is able to be turned would be a wall clock. Not all objects may be turned. 
<BR>
<li>The tool has the ability to raise or lower certain objects, thus allowing items such as the wall clock to be “hung” on a wall. Not all objects can be raised or lowered.
<BR>
</ul>
<BR>
The tool itself operates in the following manner:
<BR>
<ul><li>The player using the tool must be the owner or a co-owner of the house where the tool will be used. 
<BR>
<li>The player must actually be in the house to use the tool. 
<BR>
<li>When the player double clicks the tool, targeting the tool again with the target cursor will bring up a menu. The menu choices are “turn”, “up”, and “down”. This changes the operating mode of the tool to the choice that is made. 
<BR>
<li>Upon selecting turn, up, or down, the player will be able to target an item in the house to apply that effect. The tool will remain in whatever mode was selected, until the tool mode is changed again (refer to above). 
<BR>
<li>The player can either double click the tool again and then the house object to apply the last movement style chosen on the tool, or the player can use the target cursor on the tool itself to choose another movement style (such as selecting down instead of up).
<BR>
</ul>
<P>
House objects being moved must be locked down prior to being moved, and will remain locked down during the Decoration Tool movement process. 
<P>
<b>Taxidermy Kits</b>
<P>
Taxidermy Kits will allow for players to use corpses of certain creatures to create trophy deeds, which can be used within houses to generate a wall mounted trophy.
<P>
Taxidermy Kits will be found on NPC Tanners, usually found within “leather and hide” shops in towns. Only master and above carpenters can use the kit itself, as those without master or grandmaster status in carpentry will be unable to figure out the kit’s workings.
<BR>
A master carpenter is defined by UO as a player with 90.1 or above base carpentry skill (base skill, visible by checkmarking selecting “show real” in the skill window).
<P>
The player will need the following items to create a trophy:
<BR>
<ul><li>Taxidermy Kit 
<BR>
<li>10 boards 
<BR>
<li>corpse of either:
<BR>
<ul><li>Orc 
<BR>
<li>Gorilla 
<BR>
<li>Troll 
<BR>
<li>Brown Bear 
<BR>
<li>Polar Bear 
<BR>
<li>Great Hart 
<BR>
<li>Big Fish (note that “big fish” that have been stacked with other fish will not be useable by the taxidermy kit)
<BR>
</ul></ul>
<BR>
When a player with appropriate carpentry skill and materials double-clicks the taxidermy kit, they will get a targeting cursor. This cursor must be targeted on the corpse of the creature intended to be the trophy. The player will need to be at the corpse of one of these creatures to successfully use the taxidermy kit. The taxidermy kit will disappear upon successful usage, and a deed for a trophy will be placed within the player’s pack.
<P>
Any player attempting to place the trophy will need to have owner/co-owner status within the house. The trophy will need to be locked down to prevent decay or other players taking it. Double-clicking the trophy if it is not locked down will cause it to return to deed form in the player’s backpack.
<P>
<b>Armor dexterity penalty problem</b>
<P>
A bug with dexterity penalties not appearing on certain types of armor has been fixed. This fix will be retroactive and apply to all currently existing armor.
<P>
<b>Hair Stylist NPC</b>
<P>
A new type of NPC will become available throughout Britannia, which will offer restyling of hair/beards and dying for hair. Options for dying beards and hair range from both at the same time to separate selections for either hair or beards.
<BR>
The choices on this vendor will allow for selections of:
<BR>
<ul><li>Adding a new hair style (including “bald” style) 
<BR>
<li>Adding a new beard style (including no beard) 
<BR>
<li>Regular hair dye selection 
<BR>
<li>Regular beard dye selection 
<BR>
<li>Special hair dye selection (“neon” or bright colors, including 2 shades of “ice white”) 
<BR>
<li>Special beard dye selection (“neon” or bright colors, including 2 shades of “ice white”)
<BR>
</ul>
<BR>
The curly hair and “bun” hair styles will not be available from this menu.
<P>
These vendors will be in the major towns, within the alchemy shops. They will be distinguishable from regular vendors by their appearance.
<BR>
The Hair Stylist NPC will recognize gold in the customer's bankbox as payment if a selection is made, but it will not use gold that is in "check" form. The gold must be in gold form. 
<BR>
</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<b>Carpet Vendors</b> have been on the Test Shards for some time, but Calandryll stated on the Development board that they won't go in for some time, so they are not listed on "In Testing" yet.
