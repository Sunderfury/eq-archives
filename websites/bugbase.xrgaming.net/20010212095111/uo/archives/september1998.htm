Please take the neccessary info from each account and cut and past them into your UO.CFG. Why did I do this? Well heres why. I used to play UO, some of you may remember my character (Padisher of Baja) Ultimetly, cheating ruined the game for me, and no doubt others. Now its time to ruin the cheaters. I emplore you to log into every persons account here, turn them PK, and relinquish their beloved items to some poor newbies or more likely yourselves. The purpose of UOThief was to destroy UOcheaters, and it has served it well. A few intersting statistics, a) I recieved upwards of 500 emails in the span of 48 hrs with peoples username b) 50% of these emails contained peoples passwords c) the UOThief webpage amassed over 200 hits in a span of 18 hrs d) Even after UOThief was obviously seen for what it was (a fake), the emails continued to pour in. e) I am kind enough to only release a section of the users/password, but dont loose heart the others will be put to good use (kiss your characters goodbye) Also, I will continue to post any other accounts that come flying into the mailbox.</blockquote><p>I can only give one advice right now: <b>Don't cheat, don't run any programs of dubious origin and do not save your password in UO</b>.</blockquote></p>");</script>

<script>message("More on 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Programs", "<p>I was sent this:<blockquote><p>How using an \"unsupported\" third party program could get you banned from UO.</p><p>Many people have asked if the programs they are running with UO will get them banned. This is not a easy question to answer because we do not know what all the features of all the programs do. What we can say is that we do not currently \"support\" any third party programs. Running these programs will get you banned if they allow you to \"cheat\" or \"bypass\" systems in UO. Cheating is cheating with or without a 3rd party program. If you are worried about being banned for running these programs ask yourself this question: If I was not running this program at the same time as UO could I still do what the program allows me to do? Examples of where these programs become cheats are, if a program allows you to see everyone on the screen that is hidden, which can you not do without the program, you are cheating. If a program allows you to attack someone who is not even on your screen, which you can not do without the program, you are cheating. Examples of programs that do not constitute cheating are IRC clients, email clients, web browsers, and other similar programs that do not directly interact with UO.</p><p>Please remember this policy is only directed at people who are cheating. We understand that many of the programs out there do some very handy things when run with UO. Unfortunately, many of these same programs allow players to cheat which we will not allow. So remember, if you are caught cheating with or without a third party program, your account will be closed. To recap, the use of any third party program, which directly interacts with Ultima Online and allows you to perform acts not possible while playing the game as it was designed, will result in the termination of your account. If you are unsure if the program you are running does this, do not run it!</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>The Ultima Online Support Team</p></blockquote>This should clear up any confusion (heh, yeah right) about macro programs getting you banned.</p>");</script>

My GM Smith has only 48 resist.

As a direct result of their input,the following items have been added to this update:<ul><li>Problems with fast weapon degradation on the Test Center are fixed.<li>Magical armor will now give bonuses based on a percentage of the AR the item grants, instead of a flat amount. This means that the magical bonuses conferred by armor will appear to drop significantly.<li>Tinkering now consumes resources on failure.<li>The healing and veterinary skills now have the same karma effects as the healing spell.<li>Vendors now check how full your backpack is before selling you items.<li>Problems with the advancement of the following skills were fixed:<ul><li>Healing<li>Magic resistance<li>Swordsmanship<li>Fencing<li>Mace Fighting<li>Magery<li>Inscription<li>Animal taming<li>Blacksmithing<li>Stealing</ul><li>A duping bug with cooking was fixed.<li>Using spinning wheels now places the thread in your backpack instead of the ground.<li>You are now revealed if you speak while hidden.<li>Detect hidden is now difficulty-based. You learn faster from detecting better hiders.</ul>In addition, the fix for combat automove did not work, and has been removed from the update.</p>");</script>

<script>message("Back Orifice", "<p>I received a note from Silicon Traveller that brought to light some new information on Back Orifice, and rather than outlining differing situations to which people can get your uo.cfg through BO, I'm just going to tell you ways to detect it's presence.</p><p>Two ways:<blockquote><li>From the MS-DOS Prompt, type \"netstat -a -p udp\", since this is a UDP based service, there is likely to be a port above 1024 that is listening (by default it is 31337).</li><li>The most reliable way to detect is to go into your registry and check the following entry:<br><br>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunServices<br><br>The specific registry value which points to the server application is configurable. By doing so, the server application always starts whenever Windows starts, and thus is always active. The application will not appear in the Windows task list. The server application is a single executable file with a size just over 122 kilobytes. The application creates a copy of itself in the Windows system directory. If you see something that you don't wish to be running (i.e. Back Orifice), then you can delete the key and if you are smart, the executable that it points to. But remember to back up your registry, just in case you make some type of mistake. As always, there are virus detection programs which will do this for you out there. So if you are unsure of what you are doing, seek out one of those programs first.</blockquote>Thanks go out to Silicon Traveller for reminding me of the various ways to get someone's password even without them having their password saved.

<script>message("Virus Warning", "<p>Numerous people have sent in concerns over their accounts being hacked. Having heard the outcry, I've decided to enlist details on one of the breaches of security that are being used.</p><p>Back Orifice is the name of the program, written by cDc (Cult of the Dead Cow), it's main use is to get installed on unsuspecting victims machines and then to stay resident without the OS being able to detect it's presence. Typically the file makes it's way to users via ICQ or email and commonly is placed in a group of pics or a zip file so that the user will unknowingly run the program. Once it has been run, the hacker can get your password information from your uo.cfg file and then log in to your account. The following was taken from Symantec's site and more information on the virus can be found at <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/warn/backorifice.html\" target=\"_top\">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/warn/backorifice.html</a><blockquote><P><B>Is Back Orifice a Threat?</B><BR>Potentially, the tool can be used by an unscrupulous user (e.g., the attacker) to compromise the security of a computer running Windows 95 or Windows 98, for example, to steal secret documents, destroy data, etc. However, the following are obstacles limiting the threat:</P><UL> <LI>The server application must be installed on the target machine. This requires the user of the machine to either deliberately install this application or be tricked into doing so.</LI> <LI>The attacker must know the IP address of the target machine. Although, the attacker can use the client application to perform a search through a range of IP addresses, this is infeasible if the attacker can not narrow the range to a small subset because there are four billion possible IP addresses.</LI><LI>A firewall between the target machine and the attacker virtually makes it impossible for the attacker to communicate with the target machine. Most corporations have firewalls in place.</LI><LI>By following safe computing practices, for example, not downloading or running applications from unknown sources, users can protect themselves from the potential threat.</LI></UL></blockquote>Your best bet is to not accept anything via email or ICQ unless you are 100% sure that you trust the sender. Another option that will thwart the hacker's attempts is not saving your UO password. To do this, make sure that the Save Password selection at the login screen doesn't have a checkmark in it. Origin can't do anything about this, so let the user beware.</p>");</script>
