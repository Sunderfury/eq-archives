<table width="97%" border="0" align="center"><tr><td style="font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Interview with Chris Taylor on Dungeon Siege</td></tr><tr><td>By Atomic</td></tr><tr><td style="font-size: xx-small;">March 28, 2001</td></tr><tr><td>Now that Black&White has been released, it's time for me to once again pine for the next great title to look forward to. Being a huge fan of RPG games, and the work of Chris Taylor, it is no surprise then that the next title I can drool over and dream about is the upcoming <I>Dungeon Siege</I> from Chris Taylor and his team at Gas Powered Games. I was lucky enough to have the chance to fire a few questions his way about this gem-in-the-making. Here's what he had to say:<br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: When you were a boy growing up, did you see yourself wanting to make games for a living?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CHRIS TAYLOR</B> - Ever since I walked into arcades when I was 12 years old and saw Asteroids, Space Invaders and all the others I knew what I wanted to do. Oddly enough, I never worked in the coin-op business, but started working on PC's when I was 14.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<A HREF="images/ds/ds1.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="images/ds/ds1sm.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT=""></A><B>ATOMIC: Total Annihilation blew everyone away when it was released, and is still very popular among the multi-player crowd. Did you have any idea the game would be such a huge success?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - No, It was a huge surprise.  I am still blown away today.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: Where'd you get "Gas Powered Games' from?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - I pulled it straight out of my...  Wait!  That's not printable. :)</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<A HREF="images/ds/ds2.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="images/ds/ds2sm.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT=""></A><B>ATOMIC: Well that clears up THAT question! Where did the inspiration for Dungeon Siege come from?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - Diablo was a huge inspiration, but before that it was the older games like Wizardry.  I really love the idea of romping through a huge fantasy world, but wasn't getting all that I needed as a gamer with the stuff that was coming out.  I wanted to marry some of the depth of the older more traditional RPG's with the faster pace of games like Diablo.  I wanted to allow the player a lot of freedom to have as many characters in the party as they want, and to develop the skills of each character in any way they want.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: How are you blurring the lines between RTS and RPG? How will fans of both genres be drawn in?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - Well, Dungeon Siege is an RPG game first and foremost.  We only borrowed a few interface elements from RTS.  And with up to eight characters in the party, it became obvious that formations were going to play a large role also.  Hopefully fans of RPG's will be right at home, and RTS players will have a blast also. Characters in the party will be able to begin using weapons or spells, and will increase the experience in that particular skill.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<A HREF="images/ds/ds3.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="images/ds/ds3sm.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT=""></A><B>ATOMIC: What skills can we expect? Thieving skills? Different schools of magic to specialize your mage? Will players end up breaking down their characters into specific 'classes'?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - Each character can develop skills in melee, archery and magic.  They can combine these base skills to form any class they want.  There are no rules or restrictions, but the player has to be careful not to end up with a jack-of-all-trades.  We have two schools of magic.  Formerly Good and Dark magic, we are now calling them Combat and Nature.  It's a way to get more spells in the game with more variety and choices for the player.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<A HREF="images/ds/ds4.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="images/ds/ds4sm.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT=""></A><B>ATOMIC: Given the open-endedness provided by the Siege Engine, how will you keep players on-track with the story and headed in the right direction after discovering plot elements?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - If the player is interested in the story, they can stop and talk to all the characters in the world and solve all the different quests. However, it is not required, and players can choose to ignore the story and just play through like a pure action game.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: Were there any particularly difficult challenges or complex bugs when programming the game?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - We have had many programming challenges, but none as complex as our continuous 3D world.  With this technology the player will never see a loading screen after the game starts.  It is our hope that this will take the RPG to the next level of immersion.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<A HREF="images/ds/ds5.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="images/ds/ds5sm.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0 ALIGN="LEFT" ALT=""></A><B>ATOMIC: Will the player be able to pan, zoom and hold a favorite camera angle?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - Yes, the camera can be rotated around the party, zoomed in tight and the angle can be adjusted.  We provide many different ways to control the camera, using the keyboard, mouse, and all of these controls can be mapped to use advanced input devices like the MS Strategic Commander.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: How difficult is it to balance such a wide-open game for playability and difficulty scaling?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - It's a huge task... no doubt about it.  It is one of the biggest challenges that we have remaining.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: Will each player have a unique experience? Are there rare creatures, encounters or items that players will acquire?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - We have many different places in the world to explore, that no doubt will have people playing the game more than once to find.  We also have a huge variety of special and rare items, as we believe this is one of the things that make a great RPG... Lot's of cool stuff!!! :)</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<A HREF="images/ds/ds6.jpg" TARGET="_blank"><IMG SRC="images/ds/ds6sm.jpg" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=112 BORDER=0 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT=""></A><B>ATOMIC: Roughly how many monsters and quests are in the game?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - We look to be around a hundred monsters, and about twenty quests on the main story.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: What, in your opinion, is the most exciting part of the game?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - Our coolest achievement is our huge seamless world that never puts up a loading screen. And the ability for players to make and share their own fantastic worlds with friends.  But when it comes to excitment, I hope the combat delivers and people say, wow, this is a crazy freakin' game!</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: One of my all-time favorite pen-and-paper RPG encounters was the good old bar room brawl. Any chance of seeing one in Dungeon Siege?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - None planned at present, but that won't stop you from creating one with our Siege Editor! :)</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: Glad you brought that up! The Siege Editor will be included with the game. Are you hoping to have players continue the game past it's story? Create new dungeons to romp in? Complete conversions with brand new ideas?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - Absolutely.  We have done everything we can think of to make the game easy to extend and create mods for.  We will release the Siege Editor when the game is done and will hopefully see some really awesome stuff from the community!</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: What can we expect from multi-player? What are some of the modes? Will we be able to play the single-player game in co-op mode or import single-player characters into the multi-player arena?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - We have several different multiplayer modes. First players can jump into and play together in the single player campaign.  Second, we have a large multiplayer world we built so that players can import characters from other games, including their single player game, and play against each other, or work as a team to take-down one of the large creatures in the world.  Of course they can play in a world they created themself if they want.  We also have something called the short-game that allows players to set a time-limit and a goal like most kills, most gold, capture item, etc. We have set it up so that new game types can be invented also.</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
<B>ATOMIC: Finally, when can we expect Dungeon Seige to hit <br>
shelves?</B><br>
<br>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I><B>CT</B> - Hopefully this fall, or I will be leaving town! :)</I></BLOCKQUOTE><br>
<br>
On behalf of the Crossroads Gaming Network, I'd like to thank Chris for taking the time out of his busy schedule to answer these questions. Now, get cracking on putting this game on the shelves! :)</td></tr></table><!-- banner2 code --></td>
