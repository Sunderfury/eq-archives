We know the Abyss server was only up in spurts, but we got some great results and responses from this test. Plus, the Abyss shard proved itself quite popular.<p>We are planning to work on the stability issues tomorrow and get the server right back up as quickly as we can. Thanks again for helping us check it out.<p>***END MESSAGE***<p>So the programming dudes will begin bright and early again tomorrow. Everyone get some sleep and we will be monstering again shortly. :)<p>Oh, and I can't thank everyone enough for getting in there and mixing it up.

<script>message("Update On TC Tonight", "<p>I was talking to Faceless tonight and he said there would probably be an update to TC tonight, this is from the Update Center:<blockquote>Tonight the Test Center is being updated again, with the final form of the upcoming update. We've called this the \"crowd-pleaser\" update, as it consists primarily of player-requested features, such as exceptional plate, a change to bardic provocation flagging, and \"maker's marks\" for exceptional items.</p><p>Be sure to test out the new weapons as well! All existing weapons will be changed retroactively as soon as they are equipped. This has the side-effect of making all existing exceptional and below average weapons be normal--but with the new capability to craft exceptional weapons with maker's marks, we imagine you'll be trying to make new exceptional weapons anyway! :) </p><p>Another major item in this update is a change to skills and stats advancement. A key change here is that you'll be able to advance stats with any skill, even if you are at grandmaster level already. </p></blockquote>I've been playing with Maker's Marks for some time...pretty nice, get on there and test it out!</p>");</script>

We have seen enough demand on Dragenfels to justify opening another shard.  I just wanted to make it clear that we were always planning on opening Europa.

Nous avons décidé d'ouvrir Europa samedi à 7 heures du matin (heure française), soit vendredi à minuit (CST). Les demandes sur Dragenfels ont été suffisantes pour justifier l'ouverture d'une autre Shard. Je voulais juste qu'il soit clair que nous avons toujours prévu d'ouvrir Europa. Nous publierons bientôt les périodes de Down et les heures des GMs. Actuellement, nous prévoyons de fournir un support GM de 16h00 à 2h00 (heures anglaises).

In the UK, we peer directly with the other 40 or so member at LINX (The London Internet Exchange).</p><p>So, If you game in Europe and have bad ping times and hop via The USA to get across the English channel to the Euro shards; then get yourself an ISP who uses the above people, OR, peers with them.</p><p>As an example: Frankfurt gamers get 50ms times to the Euro Shards , while I (only 60 miles from the shards) only get 120ms times!

<script>message("What's in the patch", "<p>Here's what is in today's patch:</p><ul><li><b>Client patch</b> : these items will require a client patch to be visible to you.<ul><li>The Big Window feature from <a href=\"http://www.owo.com/t2a/\" target=\"_top\"><i>The Second Age</i></a> will be given to all players in token of our appreciation, and as part of the celebration of <i>Ultima Online</i>'s first year of existence. <p><ul><b>Using the Big Window</b><li>When in <i>windowed mode</i>, you can simply grab the window edges and resize your UO window to any size you like. Note that video performance at the larger sizes will depend on your hardware.<li>You can use the Big Window in <i>full screen</i> as well. Just add one of the following lines to your UO.CFG file:<blockquote>FullScreenRes=640x480<br>FullScreenRes=800x600<br>FullScreenRes=1024x768</blockquote>When you enter full screen mode (either via the options menu or by hitting ALT-ENTER), you will go to the specified resolution. The area not taken up by the game play area will be left black.<li>You will be able to drag any interface window out into the black area while running with Big Window.<li>You can move the play area itself around in the black space by clicking and dragging on the gold braid surrounding it. You cannot, however, resize the play area, which is always 640x480 in size.</ul><li>\"Paperdoll lag\" caused when sailing, hiding, and drinking potions should be resolved.<li>You will no longer be able to walk uo onto furs or vegetables.<li>Combat automove should be completely gone!<li>Chopping up corpses will now result in a pile of remains, which is a container. Within the remains will be the contents of the original corpse.  This container acts exactly the same as the original corpse--looting it can still result in criminal flagging. <i>Special thanks to the regulars at the Crossroads of Britannia Dev and Discussion boards, whose discussing of this problem led us to a solution.</i></ul><li><b>Guilds and player vs player combat</b>:<ul><li>The Fame requirement or joining and staying in order/chaos guilds will be removed.<li>All the glitches in fealty calculation in guildstones are believed to be ironed out. Incorrect GMs will be automatically deposed when fealty challenges occur.<li>You are no longer criminal flagged for looting the corpses of opponents in guild warfare.</ul><li>Learning skills by watching people who are using them will be removed.<li>Problems with ghosts entering certain caves will be fixed.<li>All references to mounts now use the word \"mount\" instead of \"horse.\"<li>The invisibility spell, broken last update, will function again.<li>Game Masters will no longer be revealed for getting items out of corpses while invisible.<li>Players who take items from their own corpse while hiding will no longer be revealed.<li>GMs have gained the ability to tell who last changed a house sign; if your house's sign has been defaced, GMs will be able to determine the identity of the vandal. <i>Special thanks to the rec.games.computer.ultima.online newsgroup for the suggestion of this feature!</i><li>The text message for the armslore skill, broken last update, will be correct again.<li>Excess messages were removed from the healing skill.<li>Healing should be advancing properly now. The amount you advance is based on how wounded the individual you tried to heal was--the skill is now difficulty based, so the more health the target is down, the greater the chance of increase.<li>Incidentally, the vet skill will behave the same way.<li>Spell casting interruption should now be correct. In the last upadate, a change was made to it which we have determined was not well-balanced. It has therefore been reverted back out.<li>Very tough llamas should no longer occur. (We know a lot of folks asked for them to stay this way as they were being used as house guards. We will see about adding something else to serve as house guards).<li>Several more fixes were made to prevent abuse via third-party programs. In particular, a house-looting tactic will be fixed.<li>Fishing poles will no longer vanish when used from the ground. This was a problem introduced with the last update.<li>Explosion potions no longer set off other explosion potions. <i>We regret that our earlier post seemed to indicate that the explosion potion was changed <b>only</b> at the request of the City of Oasis, without input from other player sources. Reports from the City of Oasis on Sonoma, which was suffering from terrorist bombs during their periodic Fight Nights, and subsequent support from other player commentary brought this issue to our attention. Please note that the explosion potions were never intended to be instant-kill tools. From now on, explosion potions will only detonate themselves.</i><li>Escortees will now only respond to the word \"destination\", and will no longer spam you when you talk.<li>The poisoning skill is fixed. Difficulty in making more powerful poisons will now work correctly. <i>Many thanks to the players who wrote in with exact details of this problem.</i><li>Using scissors on a bolt of cloth now leaves the remaining cloth in your backpack, instead of on the ground.<li>Horses now eat fruit again.</ul>");</script>
