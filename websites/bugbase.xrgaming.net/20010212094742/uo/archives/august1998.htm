<script>message("We've Moved!", "<dd>As DD indicated in the chat last night, the UO Bugs Forum has moved! We have found a home on the <a href=\"http://www.crossroadsrpg.com\" target=\"_top\">Crossroads Network</a> and will be there for the rest of our days. As DD noted last night, we are working in full cooperation and coordination with OSI in order to get all the bugs reported and fixed. So, drop by for our grand reopening at <a href=\"http://www.crossroadsrpg.com/bugbase/uo\" target=\"_top\">http://www.crossroadsrpg.com/bugbase/uo</a> and check out the site.</dd><p>We've also added a new cgi based bug reporting form courtesy of Silk Designs, so check it out.</p>")</script>

<script>message("OSI Recognition", "<dd>As many visitors know, we were named in an implementation of upcoming OSI procedures along with the <a href=\"http://www.mwcyber.com/GateTraveler\" target=\"_top\">Gate Traveler</a>. So what does this mean? Well, it means that OSI will be looking to both our site and the Gate Traveler in order to fix things that are broken. How does this change things? Truthfully? It doesn't do much for UO initially, but hopefully it will help the game out in the future.</dd><dd>OSI will be dealing with our site directly, they have mentioned adding a GM position that is based on working with the two sites to make sure things like the past patch (dubbed \"Armageddon\") doesn't happen again. So, how can you help?</dd><dd>First, send in the bugs. Second, read through the bugs and send in confirmations of the bugs that you have been able to reproduce. This doesn't give you a license to try out bugs on the public shards, but rather is just asking for help. We can't catch every bug without your help. And after all, that's what we are here for.</dd></p>");</script>

<script>message("Name Change and Moving", "<dd>Alrighty, we are undergoing some slight changes...as of yesterday, our name has become the UO Bug Base to go along with the almost ready site RPG Bug Base, which will house UO, AC, EQ, and other games in the future. We will be moving to http://bugbase.crossroadsrpg.com as soon as the guy who does the subdomain registering can get it ready...Sunday was the mentioned date. We will advertise this on the news sites when this change comes.</dd></p>");</script>

<script>message("Overwhelming Response", "<dd>We've recieved over 1000 visits to our site in less than 18 hours. That's a big statement for those people out there who are wanting to get these long-time bugs out of the way. Thanks to all of you who submit your bug reports, you are a tremendous help and asset to the game.</dd><dd>We recieved notification that UO:T2A would be under NDA and thus a bug site for the beta would probably not be in our best interest (read: OSI doesn't want us to talk about it), so we are going to leave the page up as a place to add bugs when UO:T2A becomes public. Hopefully 90% of the other bugs that exist will be gone by then.</dd><dd>And yes, we are not an exploit site. We are doing our best to keep the intimate details out of exploiters hands and into the hands of those who need them, the programmers. Quote of the day:<blockquote><i>\"Your site is uselss to players looking to gain an advantage.\"</i></blockquote>Our reply to that was \"Good.\" We are hoping to be an asset to the UO World, not a hindrance. One other statistic: We had over 100 bugs reported from the public shards last night alone. That alone is enough bugs to keep us around for some time to come.</p>");</script>

<script>message("UO: The Second Age Beta", "<dd>I happened to get into the beta application of UO: The Second Age last night and this is going to help this site become what it needs to become. A center for bug reporting. We have had many a discussion with those involved in UO and want to make it clear that we aren't your run of the mill bugs site. We are working in our best abilities with OSI to bring them what it is they need. Bug Reports. So sometime tonight we will also be adding a UO:T2A Beta Bugs Section for when that opens up. Let us know what you think of the site. And as always, keep those bugs coming in (we should have a cgi-form up in the next day or so for reporting bugs efficiently).</DD></p>");</script>

If you don't know, please state that too. Also, if you see some of our bugs that need to be moved to TC or Public Shards, inform me.</dd><br><DD>Also, we are currently trying to talk DD into helping us get GM assistance with testing these bugs so we can clarify their replication and confirm them.</DD></p>");</script>

It is pretty barren there due to lack of resources...(read: I haven't had time to find all my old notes.), so please send in any bugs you can come up with.</dd><dd>Also, I moved all the bugs into their correct locations...so Test Center Bugs have bugs from the test center, and Public shard bugs are on the UO Bugs section.</dd></p>");</script>
