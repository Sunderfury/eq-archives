<script>message("Provocation Update - A Tale of Woes", "<p>I received this today:<blockquote>     The Bards of the land have a difficult life.  Many a time we perish at the hands of those we cannot calm, the evil creatures we failed to incite, and almost any person that wishes to do us harm.    We cower whilst the warrior unsheaths his sword, the archer draws his bow, and the mage's hands crackle with electrical energy.    The \"In Developement\" of bards not being able to provoke through walls will surely rob us of our only offense and defense, our song.</p><p>Provoking is one of the more difficult skills to master and yields few rewards until becoming well versed at it.  With 2 agressive creatures it usually requires the provoking of both of them if they are able to reach there current target.  More often than not, if chasing the bard, they will attack him/her again if they close on them even if provoked.  The skill delay and difficulty in targeting makes it a nigh impossible skill to use on the run.  Provoking currently is of use only in dungeons with ledges/walls and some areas of the \"New Lands\" with ledges and whilst attacking other players.  Peacemaking, whilst good for fleeing, is by far too short in duration and fails to interupt spells.  Provoking is a musical skill, and as so,  permiates through walls like Peacemaking. Area effect spells will, as it seems, to still be able to pass through walls.  (consistancy please)</p><p>Solutions are possible only by understanding the problem.   In my bias I have difficulty understanding the reasoning, surfice to say that you cannot see the creatures (why would you run from them or prepare a spell if you could not sense their presence).  Peacemaking of a longer duration or being much like the proposed evil update (make bards be non targetable by monsters for a longer duration)  might enable them time enough to strum their instrument a second time so they could motivate evil creatures to fight amongst themselves.  </p><p>I roleplay my bard with great exuberance, it would be a shame to no longer be a story teller, a poet and singer, thinker.  For I would no longer hunt with a bard whose weak in skills of combat, for I would join the ranks of boredom and play a character that could defend him/herself on an equal plane instead of being the victum of those who take not the time to enjoy our entertainment.   </p><br><br>\"<i>Thine tears flow on their own, but you shalt make them a flood\"</i>  - Kindered Spirit - Grandmaster Bard</blockquote></p>");</script>

Macroing can mean a number of different things, but it is the unattended macroing that we are most concerned with, not usage of the in-game macros. Unattended macroing means being away from your UO session while your character repeats a series of actions for any length of time. Any macro that repeats is potentially unattended. Some players use macroing programs to aid them in repetitive tasks within the game, and, although it may seem as if these programs are benevolent time savers, when used in an unattended or repeating manner, these programs actually create problems within the game. Many people who play UO are not willing to pay for these programs to assist in character development, nor do they feel comfortable playing in a world where such tools are available to others. They simply wish to play in the environment they feel Ultima Online should be. We tend to agree with those players.<div>Players found to be engaged in unattended macroing will be kicked from the game and a note will be placed on their account. Being kicked means that your connection to UO will be terminated. This is not a banning; it is simply that we are dropping your connection while you are not present in the game. Players who consistently violate the terms of service by using 3rd party programs to perform unattended macroing may have their account banned on a temporary or permanent basis. Players should only call a GM to report others performing unattended macroing when it is interfering with their gaming experience.</blockquote>Unfortunately, I don't see this being that effective...people are going to macro, trying to enforce this policy will be hard if not impossible...sure you'll catch a few players who do it and you'll lose money from them quitting, but ultimately it's the mundane tasks that cause macroing for the more experienced players (in my opinion of course).</p>");</script>

<script>message("UO University", "<p>GM Ironwill sent this in:<blockquote>If you can or would like to please pass the information about the creation of the University on to whatever groups or individuals you think could contribute to this. This will be a project of mine that I will continue to work on over the next couple weeks, and I will work on that in addition to the daily events that I will be running. Just in case you do not have it, here is what can be sent around along with a mailing address (<a href=mailto:uo-university@owo.com>uo-university@owo.com</a>) where people can send in ideas.</p><p>I am creating a sort of \"school\" for beginner to intermediate players to be able to attend. We will have a weekly, scheduled class that will hit on various topics. One week we could have a Magery class, the next a history of Jhelom, and the following week maybe something like Lifestyle of the Skara Brae Ranger. The goal is to offer some more in-depth quality and experience to the roleplaying as well as being able to inform and teach newer players on the various intricacies of the game.</p><p>It is kind of easy to set up Fighters' Class 101 for newbies because they absolutely know nothing and need to know everything. However the more hours you put in, the more knowledge you accrue. Here are a couple things I woud like some feedback on.</p><p><ul><li>What (if any) subject or class would you as a player like to see within the University?<li>Who should run the classes, and what qualities would make good teachers?<li>When you were a newbie, what was the one thing you wished someone had told you about that would have made the game a heck of a lot easier?<li>What else would you like to see from the University that would help build a positive environment for the new player?</ul></p><p>If you have any comments, questions, or ideas about this, please send them to uo-university@owo.com <a href=mailto:uo-university@owo.com>uo-university@owo.com</a>. This framework for this is mostly built, and all I need to do is start filling in the details that will help lay groundwork for something that will hopefully enrich players' experience in the game should they choose to be a part of it. Soon hereafter I will begin to create scheduling for players to come and give their own lectures at the Unversity.</p><p>Thanks folks and have a good day! :-)</p></blockquote>");</script>

This makes selling trapped chests a viable business again for tinkers, and means that those who actually set up traps will be the ones to take murder counts. This does not apply to chests dropped in houses by the owner or a friend of the house, however.</ul><li><strong>Items</strong><ul><li>Once an item has been placed in the trade window, you will not be able to remove it unless you cancel the trade. Cancelling will return all items to the backpacks of the two players involved. This was done in order to reduce the viability of common \"trade window scams.\"<li>House deeds will now be newbie items. They cannot be stolen, and they remain with your corpse when you die (unless you are a murderer). Architects will still sell these for a normal price, however.<li>You can no longer overload yourself by placing items in a locked container.<li>Various optimizations were done to guildstones to improve performance.<li>You will no longer be able to lock things down under your house sign.</ul><li><strong>Creatures</strong><ul><li>Monsters will no longer spawn inside of houses--a method by which this could still happen was fixed.<li>Pack llamas no longer create fur.</ul><li><strong>Reputation</strong><ul><li>An exploit involving evading murder count with a particular item was corrected.<li>You will be able to determine whether you will receive stat loss on resurrection. If you say \"I must consider my sins\" you will receive a message about your murders.<ul><li>If you have never received a murder report, you will get \"Fear not, thou hast not slain the innocent.\"<li>If you have been reported, but currently have no murder count, you will get \"Fear not, thou hast turned from thy evil ways.\"<li>If you have murder count, but it is not enough to result in stat loss, you will get \"Although thou hast slain the innocent, thy deeds shall not bring retribution upon thy death.\"<li>If you are liable for stat loss, you will get \"Death shallbring the vengeance of the innocent upon thy soul.\"</ul><li>A bug with order/chaos warfare, whereby chaos appeared red and standard guilds appeared like order guilds, was corrected.</ul></ul></blockquote></p>");</script>

Once the murderer is aflame, he will have 3 options:<br>1. Die from Fire Damage<br>2. Have a Mage cast Steelskin on him<br>3. Go swimming to extinguish the flame<br>Options 2 and 3 must be taken within 30 seconds of inflammation, or option 1 will be selected by default.
