This is the latest installment of a frequently updated series of reports on "The State of the Code" for Asheron's Call. In this report, we keep players informed as to the state of some of the more technical aspects of AC, particularly bugs we are working on and technical limitations of which you should be aware. Look on the “News”page on the Zone for other articles about recent additions and changes to AC.
<P>
Minor game update of July 14 
<BR>
In the early hours of July 14, we introduced a minor update. This update fixed a few of the problems that were introduced with the major update on July 11. These fixes included: 
<P>
-The Transfer Spell cap of 100 has been removed. The text stating how much you transferred now displays the correct amount, and there is no cap. 
<BR>
-The portals into the Black Spawn Den and the Olthoi Lair are now tieable again. 
<BR>
-The Ore in the Lugian Mines spawns correctly again. 
<BR><BR>
When I try to us the Dagger Glyph on the high-quality refined Chorizite in an attempt to make a Ravenous Dagger, I get an error saying, “You are not trained in that trade skill”. I have trained in the Dagger skill - what's wrong? 
<BR><BR>
Unfortunately there is an bug that looks for you to have a different skill then Dagger. We are working to fix this problem. In the meantime, hang on to the Glyph and the Chorizite as you will be able to make the Ravenous Dagger as soon as this bug is fixed. </I>

Well here are the patch notes for the July 11th Build. Looks like a few bugs have been closed off. I look forward to going in and seeing how many bugs I can close...<p>

Detailed Notes for Builds 2370-2389: <p>Squelch has been updated. There is now a new set of commands to enable a user to take more control over their gaming experience. The improved functionality will allow you to squelch all characters from a single player. You can also filter out unwanted messages, such as assessment. All other previous functionality of squelch remains the same. For a complete list of all commands, try the in-game help by typing: /help squelch, /help filter, /help advancedsquelch and /help messagetypes. <br>All wands, whether new or previously owned, fire more slowly. <br>All quest-item wands, whether new or previously owned, use half as much mana. <br>Only new non-quest-item wands will use half as much mana - we were unable to change old non-quest-item wands. <br>Certain monsters, such as Olthoi, Lugians, Zefirs, and Phyntos Wasps, are more likely to switch their targets than before, and attack those who are hurting them the most. <br>It less likely that you will pop off the edge of a mountain and slide down the slope. <br>Strange new weapons with properties unseen before in Dereth have been added. <br>More powerful spears and maces have been introduced. <br>The maximum stacking size for spell components has been increased to 100 and for craft items to 50. <br>New spells to discover have been added! <br>New extremely powerful monsters, residing in a place yet to be discovered by powerful adventurers, have been added . . . be careful where you tread! <br>The problems with players receiving " You are not a Player Killer " error, or (if PK) hurting themselves while firing arrows, have been fixed. <br>Using mana stones on Compound Bows now brings up a confirmation panel. <br>Monsters in some dungeons now regenerate a bit more slowly, to prevent the dungeons from getting too overloaded. <br>New and exciting dungeons have been added for all to enjoy. <br>Added alchemy/fletching/cooking mastery to the treasure system - magic hats now have a 5% chance of having one of these spells on it. <br>Chances that a Diamond Golem will drop a heart have been increased. <br>The odds of getting a trophy from certain banderlings have been increased. <br>Corpses no longer float! Gravity has sucked them back down to earth. <br>Ambient sound upgrade project has begun. The center of the Obsidian Plain and volcanic regions have received love in this update. More to come. <br>

A new state of the code has been posted...<p><br>

Look on the “News” page on the Zone for other articles about recent additions and changes to AC. <p>I am an archer, and while firing, I have been told I'm not a player killer, or I am hurting myself!<br>A recently introduced bug makes it possible to hit yourself with your own arrows or crossbow bolts when firing at a steep upward or downward angle. If you are a Non-Player Killer, it only wastes the shot. If you are a Player Killer, however, you can take damage. This will be fixed in the next major update. Meanwhile, please be careful when firing at these sharp upward or downward angles. <p>Minor game update on June 10<br>On June 10, in the early hours, we made a minor update to the game. This fixed the instances of duplicating-monster swarms seen in the Direlands. No other changes were made. <p>We no longer need reports of these duplicates; however, the reports you sent in were much appreciated! Thank you. <p><br>
