	<b>Unnecessary Spam</b>

	<dir>

		<li>Bowyering Spam</li>

		<dir><i>The sound on this is enough to tell people what they are doing. Why not make these private messages?</i></dir>

		<li>Escort Spam</li>

		<li>Provocation Spam</li>

	</dir>

	<b>Items that aren't stackable</b>

	<dir>

		<li>Same types of foods (dough piles, water pitchers, cakes, pies, cookies, (some of the raw ribs don't), etc)</li>

		<li>Balls of yarn that you spin from wool don't stack in your pack</li>

		<li>Blank runes</li>

		<li>Blank maps</li>

		<li>Bolts of cloth don't automatically stack in your pack when made from thread or yarn</li>

		<li>The stacks of cloth (the ones you can buy in the stores)</li>


	</dir>

	<b>Weight/Item Differences</b>

	<dir>

		<li>Key Rings and Spell Books are containers which hold one type of item (keys and scrolls). They will register a weight of 1 stone and 0 stones (respectively) in your backpack, but won't go into the bank if your bank couldn't hold all the individual items.</li>

		<li>Small books weigh 2 stones. Large books weigh 1 stone.</li>

		<li>Kindling weighs more than a log</li>

		<li>Stackable items which weigh less in stacks (cheese wheels, ribs, empty bottles)</li>

		<li>Bandages weigh a lot more than the bolt of cloth they are made from</li>

		<li>Large longsword weighs 7 stones, small longsword weighs 1 stone</li>

		<li>One shaft per log? Sounds unreasonable, since Logs weigh 2 stones, and shafts only .2</li>

		<li>Lockpicks weigh 1 stone each</li>

	</dir>

	<b>Graphic/Art/Sound Problems</b>

	<dir>

		<li>Anything worn on top of other items should cover the underlying item (biggest complaints are with bone armor, bandanas, and how dresses show bare arms no matter what's worn under them)</li>

		<li>When you move items to fast, they disappear client side until they are refreshed by someone else or you log out and back in.</li>

		<li>Characters on moving boats moonwalk when there are more than 1</li>

		<li>The wooden throne looking chairs face in all directions but you can only sit in them if they point the normal south or east.</li>

		<li>Can't sit on stone benches</li>

		<li>The system sees armories as horizontal containers (like a chest) instead of vertical ones.  As such any items placed on the far right will be obscured by the art for the door, and items cannot be placed in the upper half of the armorie.</li>

		<li>Walk into a tropical area and hear those bird sounds? Well those sounds tend to never go away until you log out no matter where you recall</li>

	</dir>

	<b>Skill idiocies</b>

	<dir>

		<li>The long delay after Bowyering.</li>

		<li>If you fail carving shafts, all your logs are consumed.</li>

		<li>You can be seen snooping, but not be revealed when hidden and snooping.</li>

		<li>How can you navigate someone's pack and pluck out a specific piece of loot, all while carrying a halberd or a bow.</li>

		<li>Higher level mages with higher int doing less damage than lower level mages with lower int.</li>

		<li>It shouldn't take mana to use inscription if it takes mana to cast off a scroll (a compromising suggestion would be for inscription to take mana for 2 levels lower to create the scroll, i.e. it take the mana for casting a 4th level spell to scribe a 6th level scroll)</li>

	</dir>

	<b>Melee/Weapon Annoyances</b>

	<dir>

		<li>When you are in the heat of battle and you misclick on your guildmate, you attack them without a query of any sort...MY SUGGESTION: Implement a 'Friendly Fire Query' so that when you have it on you get a query if you are about to hit a guildmate. Should apply to other skills such as provoke, etc, as well.</li>

		<li>If a stationary archer's target is out of range when his "reload time" is over the attack will be aborted and he will have to wait out the entire reload time again before he may fire again.</li>

		<li>After you target a monster, a second monster will often be auto-targeted when it attacks you, rather than staying on the creature you originally targeted.</li>

		<li>Anyone who attempts to murder you should be permanantly flagged to you.</li>

		<li>When you find an item which is indestructible or good durability it is always well worn, makes those types of studded gloves, bows, and xbows almost useless since you can't repair them.</li>

		<li>Teleporting clears your "currently attacking" highlighting, exactly as if you had tabbed out of combat</li>

	</dir>

	<b>Monsters/Pets/NPCs</b>

	<dir>

		<li>Monsters, Guards and Energy Vortexes can attack invisible players.</li>

		<li>The amount of dogs and cats that exist</li>

		<li>Pets should respond to move if they aren't attacking (fixes the pet standing in the doorway problem)</li>

		<li>There are no general terms for getting NPCs attentions (recommendation of citizen or Britannian)</li>

		<li>Monsters spawning on dungeon walls</li>

		<li>The karma/fame values for various creatures are pretty screwy.  Bone magi are more valuable than liches, etc.</li>

	</dir>

	<b>Miscellaneous</b>

	<dir>

		<li>Co-owners can lock down items, but they can not dye locked down items, and they cannot turn on and off monster statues.</li>

		<li>FURNITURE IS THE MOST EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL THING IN THE WORLD TO PLACE!!!!</li>

		<li>Login to a server that has already given the "Server is going down shortly" message should give you the message as soon as you log in.

		<li>Crafted items should fall into the containers the raw materials are placed in, much like tailored goods (smithed goods, tinkered goods, etc don't)</li>

		<li>Why not make allow bolts of cloth to be made without having to click 5 thread separately...perhaps make it check the same way ingots do when smelting them from ore.</li>

		<li>Fighting being the only determinant for a high reputation and fame.</li>

		<li>Stat effecting spells should last longer</li>

		<li>Gates often bounce people back</li>

		<li>Journals don't actually scroll well at all...try using the arrow keys while you have it locked and things are being added to your journal. It jumps up and down through the text.</li>

		<li>Decay rate for body parts is too high...can't claim heads quick enough...making bounties pointless.</li>

		<li>Allnames shouldn't show peoples names in houses</li>

		<li>Metal chests should be craftable by smiths or tinkerers</li>

		<li>Summon Creature Spell should be selectable just like Polymorph.</li>
