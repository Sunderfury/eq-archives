Looks like smelting ore is now difficulty based. It is harder to smelt the higher colors.

<script>message("Eric Neumann and the Vault Network", "<p>Well I've had a day or so to calm down from his antics, and I'm not above letting my readers know what he truly thinks of them, here is a detail of the ongoings there:<blockquote>First off, I was relayed the information by some of the bigger site managers around (stratics, xrgn, etc) and it infuriated me. So I posted my thoughts on various boards, etc. All the ones on the Vault were deleted (or most of them). I don't like strong arm tactics and I never have dealt with people who try to pull rank on me like that. I don't like them as a customer and I stop business with them as quickly as possible.<br><br>So here's the deal, EQVault added a board for Verant only posts (Verant makes EQ). To be perfectly fair with Mr. Nudemann, here is his original message in it's entirety. He claims it was taken out of context. So, to summarize, a few of us from CoN and EQSS voiced some concern in a series of email's about Verant's obvious show of favoritism. Then, Eric replied with this...<br><br>&gt;Let me just clarify that the Announcements Board is not meant to replace the e-mail list. <br>&gt;This was established by myself, Dave Rickey, and Brad McQuaid to aid the Verant team <br>&gt;in posting announcements to our site. The problem we were seeing was that several very <br>&gt;important posts (which I have also seen show up on your own message boards) were <br>&gt;getting drowned out in literally thousands of other messages on our general message <br>&gt;boards, and we recognized that not everyone had the time or interest to wade through the<br>&gt;quagmire to find the important messages. It just made sense that we provide the Verant <br>&gt;staff a better place for people to see some important messages.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;If they also choose to use the e-mail list to distribute the same information, they have <br>&gt;that right, and we've never tried to stop them or discourage this. Those of you who <br>&gt;assume we have some sort of special deal with Verant or something are completely <br>&gt;mistaken.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I'm also going to be a bit blunt here, but this point needs to get across<br>&gt;somehow. We're not just a fan site anymore, but a licensed business, and we're handling<br>&gt;a completely different market segment than most of you. Most gamers don't want to surf <br>&gt;ten sites about the same game, looking for scraps of information. I'll admit some hardcore<br>&gt;gamers do, but most don't have the time or the patience. They want a place that they <br>&gt;know and trust to quickly get the latest information about a title, and we've worked<br>&gt;extremely hard to establish ourselves in this market over the past year, build a<br>&gt;community of online gamers who visit our sites, and develop relationships with the<br>&gt;people building these new online worlds.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;We get more traffic in a day than most of you have seen in months, and<br>&gt;you're going to have to accept that fact and move on. It makes sense for<br>&gt;the development teams on these games to answer some questions on our boards where <br>&gt;they know that most people will see them, instead of posting the same thing on ten <br>&gt;obcure fan sites where a large portion of their audience will never see them.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I'm sorry some of you feel you're getting cheated or something here just<br>&gt;because we're bigger than you, but get over it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Eric Neuman<br>&gt;Managing Editor<br>&gt;The Vault Network<br>&gt;http://www.vaultnetwork.com<br><br>He then wrote this to one of our board frequenter's (I'm posting it in it's entirity as well):<br><br>&gt;That information was taken completely out of context, and it doesn't surprise me it was<br>&gt;the Sploitz guys who decided to post it on our board. I have nothing but respect for the<br>&gt;fans out there, and I think our traffic speaks for the fact that we've worked hard to<br>&gt;provide you guys with the best news we can.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;What does get old is the fact that because we're the biggest, we're also a target for every <br>&gt;other 14 year old with a EQ site out there, and I get sick of them whining that Verant<br>&gt;gives us special treatment every other week. Maybe I should have been more tact in my <br>&gt;message, but I need to get the point across somehow. We have worked extremely hard<br>&gt;to evolve beyond being an amateurish fan site to something I think is more valuable for<br>&gt;the community.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Eric Neuman<br>&gt;Managing Editor<br>&gt;The Vault Network<br>&gt;http://www.vaultnetwork.com<br><br>&gt;-----Original Message-----<br>&gt;From: [blanked]<br>&gt;Sent: Friday, February 19, 1999 6:49 PM<br>&gt;To: [blanked]<br>&gt;Subject: Don't let it go to your head...<br>&gt;<br>&gt;You: \"We get more traffic in a day than most of you have seen in months, and you're <br>&gt;going to have to accept that fact and move on.\"<br>&gt;<br>&gt;You might want to try keeping that ego of yours in check.  Much of your traffic comes<br>&gt;from the fact that you are linked to so many other sites - Stratics, Crossroads Network,<br>&gt;Battle Vortex, etc... - but when you start making statements like this you begin to<br>&gt;seriously alienate these sites.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Personally, I hope this all blows up in your face. And given the fact that this statement<br>&gt;and the rest of the message it was clipped from seems to be authentic, I will no longer be<br>&gt;frequenting any sites that are part of the vault network and will encourage everyone I know<br>&gt;not to as well.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;You called EQVault a business, well then you better think about your customers. <br>&gt;Customers talk to their associates, friends and neighbors. The worse job you do, the <br>&gt;more people they will talk to about it. They might talk to three people if you do a good<br>&gt;job, and 50 if you do a bad job.  You just did a very bad job from my point of view.</blockquote>Now to respond. I am neither an \"Sploitz\" guy, 14 years old, nor am I as shallow as Neumann. I don't like to be classified as a sheep and I will not flock to their cause. This just dictates us to make a better site to stomp their \"better\" arses. It shows exactly what it is that is trying to lead this genre of gaming sites. I'm not going to support them, you can do as you please. I hope this informs you as much as it irritates me.</p>");</script>

<script>message("TC Updated", "<p>Here's what is on the plan for next update, so get to testing :)<blockquote>From FYI:<blockquote>The In Testing section has been updated with details on new features now available on the Test Center. Among these are the revamped thief system, traps in dungeons, and many more changes and additions. Be sure to check it out! We would also like to advise current members of the Thieves Guild to quit the guild before this update is published to the public servers, unless they plan to be player-vs-player thieves in the future. </blockquote><UL> <LI><B>Skills</B>  <UL><LI><I>Stealth</I> <UL><LI>This new skill allows you to take steps while hidden. <LI>You have to be hiding when you start to use the skill. <LI>The more armor you are wearing, the harder it is to use Stealth. <LI>If you run, you become unhidden. <LI>Any of the actions which normally unhides you still will. <LI>The amount of steps you can take depends on how high your skill is. <LI>You use this skill off of the skills window. <LI>You cannot learn or use this skill until you have at least 80 in Hiding. Because of this, you cannot select it as a starting skill. <LI>The skill title associated with this skill is \"rogue.\" <LI>If you qualify for training in the skill, you can learn it from thieves and thief guildmasters. Use the keyword \"stealth.\" </LI></UL><LI><I>Remove Trap</I> <UL><LI>This new skill allows you to remove traps found on containers, as well as disarm other sorts of traps, such as ones found in dungeons. <LI>This skill is used from the skills window. It will bring up a targeting cursor. Then target the trap to be disarmed. Of course, you need to be able to see the trap to disarm it. <LI>The skill title associated with this skill is \"rogue.\" <LI>You cannot learn or use this skill until you have at least 50 skill in both Lockpicking and Detecting Hidden. Because of this, you cannot select it as a starting skill. <LI>If you fail at using the skill, the trap will go off. <LI>Different traps have different levels of difficulty. <LI>Wearing gloves will make it harder to succeed. The heavier the gloves, the worse it is. <LI>If you qualify for training in the skill, thieves and thief guildmasters can train you in it. You can use any of these keywords: <UL> <LI>disarm  <LI>disarming  <LI>remove  <LI>removing </LI></UL></LI></UL><LI><I>Detect Hidden</I> <UL><LI>This skill has gained the ability to detect traps. <LI>It works just like now, examining a range around the location you target. As before, the range is scaled based on your skill. <LI>Some traps (freestanding ones in dungeons) are invisible until detected, and when found will become visible to all. <LI>At higher skill levels, merely coming close to simpler traps will result in \"trap here\" appearing over the invisible trap. Only the player with high skill will see these messages, though! The trap must be manually revealed for others to see it. <LI>House owners and friends will be abelto instantly reveal anyone hidden in their house, regardless of skill level, on the grounds that they know their house better than any stranger. <LI>The professional title for this skill is now \"scout.\" </LI></UL><LI><I>Forensics</I> <UL><LI>Using this skill on a player will reveal their affiliation with the Thieves Guild, if they are members. The difficulty of this is based on the thief's Stealing skill. <LI>If you have a certain level of ability in the skill, using it on recently picked containers will reveal who the lockpicker was. <LI>The professional title for this skill is now \"detective.\" </LI></UL><LI><I>Stealing</I> <UL><LI>The more armor you are wearing, the harder it will be to steal. <LI>You will not be able to steal from other players unless you join the NPC Thieves Guild, or unless the target is an opponent in a guild war. <UL> <LI>You can join the Thieves' Guild the usual way, by finding a  Guildmaster and asking him to join. It will cost you an entrance  fee.  <LI>You cannot join unless your character has existed for at  least one week.  <LI>The character may not have <I>any</I> murders to his name.  <LI>Being reported for murder whilst a member of the Thieves  Guild will result in summary expulsion, and you will not be able  to rejoin for at least one week.  <LI>You cannot join the Thieves Guild unless you have at least a  60 in the Stealing skill.  <LI>Members of the Thieves Guild have access to a special item,  the disguise kit.  <UL><LI>The disguise kit looks like a wig stand. <LI>You can get one by asking the guildmaster about 'disguise.' <LI>It will cost you 500 gold. <LI>He'll only sell them to Thieves Guild members. <LI>When used: <UL><LI>You can elect to change your hairstyle. <LI>If you are a male character, you can also change your facial hair. <LI>The hair will come out gray, but you can use hairdye on it as usual. <LI>It will also randomly generate a name for you. <LI>All changes will last for 2 hours. </LI></UL><LI>The disguise kit will only work for Thieves Guild members. </LI></UL> <LI>Members of the Thieves Guild do not display professional  titles on the paperdoll to anyone except themselves, regardless  of skill level or fame.  <LI>Members of the Thieves Guild can be attacked with impunity,  because they are not allowed to report anyone for murder.  <LI>In towns, it is still illegal to start fights, so Thieves  Guild members are still safe from attack, as they can call the  guards (unless of course, they just committed a crime).  <LI>Just as with any guild, you can leave the guild by finding  the Guildmaster and tellng him you quit. However, the Guild does  not let go easily--it will take one week for leaving the guild to take effect.  <LI>Victims of thieves can feel free to attack them, as they  will not go gray for attacking a thief who has stolen from them  in the last two minutes. </LI></UL><LI>There will be four possible outcomes to stealing: <UL> <LI>True success: you get the item and are not noticed.  <LI>Partial success: you get the item, but are noticed.  <LI>Partial failure: you do not get the item, but are not  noticed.  <LI>Total failure: you do not get the item, and your attempt is  noticed. </LI></UL><LI>The professional title for this skill is now \"pickpocket.\" </LI></UL><LI><I>Lockpicking</I> <UL><LI>Wearing gloves will affect your success rate at lockpicking. The heavier the gloves, the harder it will be. <LI>The professional title for this skill is now \"rogue.\" </LI></UL><LI><I>Tailoring</I> <UL><LI>A problem whereby you could not create the item because it stated that your pack was full was corrected. </LI></UL><LI><I>Mining</I> <UL><LI>A bug with smelting success was fixed. </LI></UL><LI><I>New skill titles</I> <UL><LI>The professional title for Inscription is now \"scribe.\" <LI>The professional title for Snooping is now \"pickpocket.\" <LI>The professional title for Herding is now \"shepherd.\" <LI>The professional title for Meditation is now \"stoic.\" <LI>The professional title for Mapmaking is now \"cartographer.\" <LI>The professional title for Hiding is now \"rogue.\" </LI></UL></LI></UL></LI></UL><LI><B>Magic</B> <UL> <LI>Some third-party exploits involving using items in the bank when not at the bank were fixed.  <LI>The following spells have had their chance of resist and their effect  adjusted:  <UL><LI>Mana drain <LI>Mana vampire <LI>Paralyze </LI></UL> <LI>Magic Trap scrolls will now be deleted after successful use.  <LI>You will no longer be able to report people for murder after recalling  away. </LI></UL><LI><B>World</B> <UL> <LI>Items will now spawn in chests and other containers.  <UL><LI>The items within will depend on the location of the container. <LI>These containers will be locked, with the lock's difficulty being based on the value of the contents. <LI>Some of these containers may be trapped as well. The power of the trap will also be scaled by the value of the contents. </LI></UL> <LI>Traps will begin to appear randomly in dungeons.  <UL><LI>These traps will be invisible to the normal observer. <LI>They can be detected with the Detect Hidden skill. <LI>Players who have a high level of Detect Hidden will be able to detect their presence by merely walking near them. <LI>Some traps may be poisoned. </LI></UL> <LI>Capability was added to have special event regions, to allow things like  town invasions. </LI></UL><LI><B>Items</B> <UL> <LI>Trash barrels will be added.  <UL><LI>Owners can add a trash barrel to your house by saying, \"I wish to place a trash barrel.\" A targeting cursor will come up allowing you to place the barrel. <LI>Placing a barrel obeys the same rules as locking down items in houses: not by the door, not on steps, etc. <LI>You can only have one trash barrel per house. <LI>The trash barrel looks like a silvery barrel. <LI>Owners and friends of the house can put items in the trash barrel. Three minutes after they do so, the item will be deleted. (This means you can change your mind and remove items if you need to). <LI>The owner of the house can chop up the barrel to get rid of it.  </LI></UL> <LI>Some line of sight changes were made to prevent 3rd party exploits.  <LI>Treasure map changes  <UL><LI>Certain treasure maps that used to be distorted will henceforth be created correctly. <LI>The treasure is no longer necessarily at the center of the treasure map. <LI>Finished treasure maps will now say \"a treasure map completed by <br>&gt;PLAYER name&gt; .\" <LI>Some bad treasure locations were fixed. </LI></UL> <LI>Sextants will no longer give coordinates. They will only give latitude  and longitude.  <LI>Carving stacks of fish should now work correctly.  <LI>Using a healing potion will now place the empty vial in your backpack,  instead of at your feet.  <LI>A problem with putting tables over chests causing items to disappear was  corrected. As a result, you can now freely stack chests and crates. </LI></UL><LI><B>Creatures and NPCs</B> <UL> <LI>You can no longer avoid a deadlier poison by taking a milder one, and  getting hit by deadlier poison when already affected by a milder one will  supercede the weaker poison.  <LI>Pets now have 'orneriness' factors as far as obeying commands.  <UL><LI>The harder the pet is to tame originally, the more 'ornery' it is. This means that it is more likely to refuse commands given to it. <LI>The better the player is at Animal Taming, the more they can overcome the pet's orneriness. This means that those with low animal taming will have great difficulty in controlling creatures such as dragons, draken, or nightmares. On the flip side, good animal tamers will be able to order around easy creatures such as cats and dogs, even when they are starving. </LI></UL> <LI>Human NPCs will now immediately delete items they scavenge from the  ground, rather than hanging on to them for a while. This was done because of items accumulating in the NPCs if deletion failed. <LI>Blacksmith Guildmasters should now give the correct guildname when you join their guild. <LI>Wandering mages and Mage Guildmasters are now able to teach the Meditation skill. </LI></UL></blockquote>That's a lot of stuff :)</p>");</script>

(It behooves miners to conceal this location!) <I>We have seen the feedback from those concerned that these locations will become ambush points. If this develops into a problem, we will make the veins move. For now, however, they will remain where they are found.)</I> <LI>Even a known vein will not always yield the rare mineral. <LI>You cannot combine ore of different colors. <LI>You can only smelt the colored minerals if you meet the Mining skill requirement to do so. <LI>Smelting more difficult minerals will result in a greater skill gain than smelting easy minerals. </UL> <LI>Blacksmithing <UL> <LI>You cannot work the resultant ingots unless you meet the Blacksmithing skill requirement to do so. <LI>You can make colored armor and shields from the colored ingots. <I><B>You cannot make weapons from colored ingots, and doing so will just make a weapon that looks like one made from iron ingots.</I></B> <LI><I>Known issue: making weapons from regular ingots will tell you that you are losing the color, even though it is not a colored ingot.</I> </UL> </UL><LI><B>Combat changes</B> <UL> <LI>Mace weapons now cause stamina loss and extra damage to armor when they hit an opponent. <LI>Your swing rate or firing rate with all weapons is now dependent on your current stamina, instead of your dexterity. <LI>Damage for your blow is now assessed on your opponent on the start of the swing, instead of at the end. This change makes a fast connection less of an advantage in melee combat. This will apply to wrestling and attacks made by monsters as well. <LI>Equipping a weapon now causes a short \"prep time\" before you can start swinging. <LI>Being good at anatomy will give a bonus to the damage you do in combat. </UL><LI><B>Changes to magic</B> <UL> <LI>Meditation goes in. This new skill allows faster regeneration of mana. <UL> <LI>Your mana regeneration rate is now dependent on your level of Meditation skill, your intelligence stat, and the amount of armor you are wearing. This is termed the \"passive use\" of the skill. <LI>The skill can be used from the skill gump, or via a macro. <LI>The title associated with this skill is \"Mage\" <UL> <LI>You cannot be holding anything except a spellbook, nor be wearing metallic or bone armor to use it.

Spellbooks affected will be retroactively fixed. <LI>The Magic Reflect spell now gives an error if the target already has Magic Reflect on, and does not consume mana or reagents. <LI>The magic lock spell now works against unsecure locked down containers. <LI>So does the magic untrap spell. <LI>Magic unlock and magic untrap will no longer work on secure containers. </UL><LI><B>Housing and furnishing changes</B> <UL> <LI>The one-room house which ramdomly changed appearance every time you tried to place it no longer does so. <LI>Holiday trees and ornaments are deleted. Holiday tree deeds are unaffected, but are disabled until the holiday season next year. <LI>You can no longer deed a locked-down holiday tree. <LI>You can no longer attempt to pick the lock on a secure container. <LI>The \"large smithy\" has been renamed to \"large house with patio\". <LI>Significant lockdown changes were made. Lockdown is no longer done with keys. Instead, it is done with spoken commands. These commands work only for the house owner. <UL> <LI>\"I wish to lock this down\" gives a targeting cursor and does basic lockdown. <LI>\"I wish to release this\" gives a targeting cursor and unsecures and releases the object from lockdown. <LI>\"I wish to secure this\" gives a targeting cursor and locks down and secures the object if it's a container. <LI>\"I wish to unsecure this\" gives a targeting cursor and only unsecures the container. It does not release it from lockdown. </UL> </UL><LI><B>Granting karma to other players</B> <UL> <LI>Saying \"I honor thee\" will bring up a targeting cursor. <LI>Targeting another player will remove karma points from you and give some karma points to your target. <LI>You will automatically turn to face them and bow. <I>Known issue: there's a graphical glitch if you are polymorphed and honor a player. This will be fixed shortly.</I> <LI>You have to have a positive karma of a certain level to do this. </UL><LI><B>Other skills</B> <UL> <LI>Using bandages will now unhide you. <LI>Mapmaking now has a skill delay. <LI>There is now a blacksmith NPC guild, and blacksmith guildmasters will appear in appropriate shops and halls. </UL><LI><B>Miscellaneous</B> <UL> <LI>Hair dye is now permanent. <LI>The error message given when you selected the last color on each page of hairdye is now fixed. <LI>Some cave entrances to the Lost Lands have been slightly adjusted in terms of where you end up when you exit. <LI>Poisonous creatures should start poisoning at the correct frequency again. <LI>Some map errors were corrected. <LI>Redeeded vendor deeds will now weigh 90 stones. They can now be looted as well (they will drop to your corpse). Vendors must now be emptied before they can be redeeded. </UL></UL>To note, not everything from In Testing made it into this patch.
