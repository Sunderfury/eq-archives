Details of new player interaction in the Enhanced PvP area and the Consent Area have been published on <a href="http://update.uo.com/indev.html">In Development</a>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
<b>Player Interaction Changes</b>
<p>
With the expansion of the lands and the distinction between a Consent Only area and an Enhanced PvP area, the way in which players can interact with each other must be changed as well.  The information below will detail the differences between interactions in the two areas.  Future updates will detail more information about these two areas.
<br><br>
<b>Consent Only Area</b><br>
Unless in a guild war, players will not be able to damage other players when in the consent only area.  Because players will not be able to attack each other in cases outside of guild wars, other changes must be made to the way players can interact in the consent only area to accommodate for this.
<br><br>
<i>Corpse Looting</i><br>
You will not be able to loot a corpse of another player unless you are in the same guild or at war with their guild.  The party system will also allow you to select whether you want members of your party to be able to loot your corpse or not.
<br><br>
<i>Items Blocking </i><br>
Items placed on the ground will not impede movement.  Characters will be able to walk through all items placed on the ground.
<br><br>
<i>Positive and Negative Acts</i><br>
Positive and negative spells and actions will change in the consent only area.  For the purposes of explaining how these interactions are changed, characters are grouped into three categories: Guild War, Non-Guild War, and Non-Guilded.
<ul>
<li>Guild War (GWar) - The character is in a guild that is at war with another guild.
<li>Non-Guild War (NonGWar) - The character is in a guild, but not at war with any guilds.
<li>Non-Guilded (NonGuild) - The character is not in a guild.
</ul>
<i>Interactions Table</i><br>
There are two kinds of interactions players can perform on each other: negative acts and positive acts.  
<br><br>
Negative acts include:
<ul>
<li>All negative spells, including damage spells, paralyze, stat decreasing spells, blocking spells (such as wall of stone), all mana altering spells, dispel spells, blade sprits, and energy vortexes.
<li>All combat, (includes melee, archery, purple potions, etc.)
<li>Stealing and snooping.
<li>All bardic skills.
<li>Looting others.
<li>Blocking
<li>Pet “attack” and “guard” commands.
</ul></ul>
Positive Acts include:
<ul>
<li>Positive spells such as healing, curing, resurrection, and all stat raising spells.
<li>Pet “transfer”, “friend”, and “guard” commands.
<li>Using the healing skill on another player.
</ul>
The table below describes the interactions each type of character can have with the other types of characters in the consent only area.  If the act has a “no” under it, that means that both types of characters cannot perform that type of act on each other.

<table width="80%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tr>
    <td></td>
    <td align="center">Negative Acts</td>
    <td align="center">Positive Acts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Non Guild War vs. Non-Guild</td>
    <td align="center">No</td>
    <td align="center">Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Non-Guild vs. Non-Guild</td>
    <td align="center">No</td>
    <td align="center">Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Guild War vs. Non Guild War</td>
    <td align="center">No</td>
    <td align="center">No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Guild War vs. Guild War</td>
    <td align="center">Yes</td>
    <td align="center">No</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Non Guild War vs. Non Guild War</td>
    <td align="center">No</td>
    <td align="center">Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Guild War vs. Non-Guild</td>
    <td align="center">No</td>
    <td align="center">No</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
Note that this table works both ways.  That means since a character in a Guild War cannot perform a positive act on a character in a guild that has no war declarations, the character in the guild with no declarations cannot perform a positive act on the guild war enabled character.  If you are in a guild war, the only characters you can heal are those that are in your guild.  This will remove the “blue healer” issue during guild wars when in the consent only area.
<br><br>
<i>Monsters</i><br>
Players will not be able to perform beneficial acts on any monster, animal, or NPC that is not controlled by a player (tamed, summoned, hired, etc).
<br><br>
<i>Blocking</i><br>
Blocking will also be considered a negative act.  Characters and their pets will not be able to block other characters unless they are in a guild war with that other character.  Additionally, a wall of stone cast by a mage in a guild war will not affect a non-guilded character.  Characters that are at war with the mage and characters in his guild will be blocked by the wall while those that are not will walk right through it.
<br><br>
<i>Murderers</i><br>
Murderers will not be allowed in the consent only area.  If they become a murderer while in the consent only area (because they are reported after they journey to that area) they will be removed from the consent area.
<br><br>
<b>Enhanced PvP Area</b><br>
The interactions in the PvP enhanced area will be detailed in a future communication. <br><br><br>

<b>The Faction System</b>
<p>
The faction system will allow guilds and individual players in the Enhanced PvP area to participate in battles that have consequences and meaning.  Currently, guild warfare in the game has little to no context unless provided by the participants.  The faction system will create this context for those who wish to participate.  Factions are groups of players that fight together towards a common goal.
<br><br>
<b><i>The Factions</i></b><br>
There will be four factions at the start of the faction system.  Each faction will have their own stronghold, ranking system and be either neutral or aggressive towards the other factions.  The four factions are:
<ul>
<li>Minax Faction
<li>Lord British Faction
<li>The Shadow Lords Faction
<li>Council of Mages Faction
</ul>
All factions are aggressive towards each other.
<br><br>
<i><b>Joining a Faction</i></b><br>
Players can join a faction either through their guild or individually.  Only one character per account per shard may be in a faction.
<ul>
<li>Guilds
<ul>
<li>Guild stones will have a new option in the guild master menu that will allow a guild master to side with a faction.
<ul>
<li>A guild cannot join a faction if it is at war with another guild.
<li>If a member of a guild already has another character in a faction, the character that is in the guild is removed from the guild.
<li>Guilds cannot declare war on other guilds once in the faction system.
</ul></ul>
<li>Individuals
<ul>
<li>Individual players may join a faction by visiting the faction’s stronghold and using the faction stone.
</ul>
<li>If a player wishes to quit a faction, they must wait 7 days before they are actually removed from the faction.  At that time, that character (or another character) may join another faction.  To quit a faction, the player must visit the faction’s stronghold.
<li>Killing members of your own faction can result in your character being automatically ejected from the faction.
</ul>
<i><b>Ranks/Points System</i></b><br>
Each faction will have a ranking system for its members.  The ranks will parallel each other but will have different names dependent on the faction.  Some ranks will be determined by individual actions (such as from fighting) and others will be given to players by higher ranking players.  
<ul>
<li>Your individual rank will be determined by your point total in relation to all of the other members’ point totals.
<li>These points will decay slowly over time.  Therefore, only members actively participating in the faction wars will be able to maintain a high rank.
</ul>
A points system based on kills during faction battles will determine individual ranks within the faction.  
<ul>
<li>You will get more points for killing characters of higher rank than you and less for killing someone of lower rank.  
<li>Once a character is killed, there is a delay before killing that character again will yield any points.
</ul>
Conversely, you will also lose points for being killed.  The lower the rank, in relation to your own, of the character who killed you in relation to your rank, the more points you will lose.  
<br><br>
<i><b>Leaders and Voting</i></b><br>
Faction members can vote for their leader.
<ul>
<li>Only members who are in the highest two ranks can run for leadership.
<li>Declaring yourself in the election to be a leader and voting are done at the faction stone.
<li>Elections are held once a week.
<ul>
<li>Only 10 members can run at one time.  Once 10 eligible members have declared themselves in the election, no other members can run.
<li>The election lasts for 24 hours.
<li>Each faction member gets one vote.
<li>Once the election is closed, the member with the highest vote total is the faction leader for that week.
</ul>
<li>Leadership functionality will be detailed at a later date.
</ul>
<i><b>Strongholds</i></b><br>
Each faction will have a stronghold in the Enhanced PvP area.  The exact location of these strongholds will be released in the future.
<br><br>
The strongholds will hold 8 sandstone tiles.  The purpose of these sandstone tiles is detailed later in this document.
<br><br>
<i><b>Capturing Cities</i></b><br>
Each faction in the Enhanced PvP area can fight to take over cities.  The method by which a city is captured is detailed below:
<ul>
<li>To capture a city, a faction member must steal a sigil from inside that city and bring it to their faction stronghold.
<ul>
<li>There are eight cities that can be captured. Each of the eight cities (Britain, Trinsic, Minoc, Moonglow, Yew, Delucia, Skara Brae, and Magincia) will have a sigil on a sandstone tile somewhere within the city’s boundaries.
<li>In order to get the sigil, a player must use the stealing skill and target it.  You will be required to have at least 80.0 in stealing in order to remove the sigil from the sandstone tile.
<li>If successful, the sigil will appear in the character’s backpack.
<li>Anyone carrying a sigil will “glow” a noticeable color.
<ul>
<li>Carrying a sigil will prevent you from recalling, gating, hiding, and teleporting.
<li>Once stolen, the faction has one hour to bring the sigil to their stronghold and place it on the corresponding sandstone tile.
<li>If the character is killed, the sigil will drop to their corpse. 
<li>Characters not involved in the faction wars will not be able to pick up or steal the sigil.
</ul></ul>
<li>Once the sigil is in the faction’s stronghold, it must be defended for 24 hours.  
<ul>
<li>During this time, members of the faction controlling the sigil may not steal it or remove it from the sandstone tile.
<li>You have 15 minutes to recover a sigil stolen from your stronghold before the 24 hour clock resets.
</ul>
<li>After 24 hours, the sigil will be “corrupted” and must be returned to the city.  
<ul>
<li>Once this is accomplished, the faction that returns the sigil to the city will control that city.  
<li>The sigil cannot be stolen by another faction for one week.  After that week, another faction may attempt to steal the sigil.
</ul>
<li>Once a faction controls a city, the faction leader will be able to appoint two faction members to roles in the city government.  
<ul>
<li>The Financial Minister: Will have control over the economic aspects of the city.
<li>The Sheriff: Will have responsibility over the defenses of a city.
<li>The exact level of control these two officers will have will be detailed at a later date.
</ul>
<li>The factions will also have a “treasury”.  This treasury will not be the same currency as gold in the game, rather it will grow based on the prices set by the financial minister in the cities a faction controls.  Factions will be able to further their cause with this treasure.
<li>Once the week passes, the sigil will again be stealable.  At that time, opposing factions may attempt to take the sigil from the city and return it to their stronghold.  The same rules stated above will apply.
</ul>

New items have been added to <a href="http://update.uo.com/next.html">Testing for next update</a> and some moved from In Development to Testing:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>
<p><b>Fishing</b>
<p>Fishermen at over 80 skill will have a chance to pull up a sea serpent regardless of whether they succeed or fail at fishing when in deep sea. Additionally, the treasure maps and SOS bottles will be guarded by sea serpents. Every time you fish up a treasure map or SOS bottle a sea serpent will surface and attack. 
<p><b>Changes to Skill Gain</b>
<p>Changes to the skill gain system to facilitate better gains and lessen the effectiveness of macroing.
<ul>
<li>The chance to learn a skill will be increased during the first hour of play each day for each character.  Note this only affects the chance to increase a skill, not the chance to succeed in using it.
<li>The rate at which non-difficulty based skills gain will be further increased.  
<li>The skill usage table will no longer fluctuate based on how often skills are used.
<li>Skill delays for the following skills will be shortened to one second.
<ul>
<li>Animal Lore
<li>Arms Lore
<li>Anatomy
<li>Item Identification
<li>Peacemaking
<li>Provoking
<li>Detect Hidden
<li>Enticement
<li>Evaluate Intelligence
<li>Forensic Evaluation
<li>Hiding
<li>Sprit Speak
<li>Stealth
<li>Taste Identification
</ul>
<li>With skill gain being increased in general, we have made changes to make macroing no longer yield better skill gain results than normal game play.  
<ul>
<li>Skills will generally require human intervention in order to raise them.  In many ways, this is similar to raising animal taming (raising animal taming requires you to travel looking for animals to tame) since you will need to use a skill on different items/creatures in order to gain in it.
</ul></ul>
In addition, certain “secondary” skills will raise when using an associated skill (similar to the way tactics increases while using a combat skill). You will need to mark a skill as “up” in order for it raise in this manner.
<ul>
<li>Evaluate Intelligence can raise when Magery is used. 
<li>Anatomy can raise when either a melee skill or the healing skill is used. 
<li>Lumberjacking can raise when using an axe in melee. 
<li>Meditation can raise whenever mana is regenerated. 
<li>Hiding can raise when Stealthing. 
<li>Detect Hidden can raise when attempting to pick a lock when a chest is trapped or when disarming a trap. 
<li>Animal Lore can raise when attempting to Tame. 
</ul>
<p>Bank Checks, Shopkeeper changes and Tinker Traps have been moved from In Development to In Testing.
</I>

Please report problems with skill gain to <a href="mailto:tcbugs@uo.com">tcbugs@uo.com</a>, as usual.

<b>Tinker Traps</b>
<p>
Tinker traps will be modified.  Their purpose will be to protect containers and their creation will no longer give the maker a murder count.
<ul>
<li>A trapped chest cannot be opened until the trap is disarmed and the lock removed, except:
<ul>
<li>The owner of the chest can access the chest automatically without firing the trap.  The owner is defined as the last person to lock the chest.
</ul>
<li>Using the key on the chest will bypass the trap.
<li>The lock on a trapped chest cannot be picked until the trap is disarmed.
<ul>
<li>A failed disarm attempt will result in setting off the trap.
<ul>
<li>A trap that is set off will reset itself automatically indefinitely.
<li>Damage from a trap will not cause the maker of the trap to be a candidate for a murder count.
</ul>
<li>Disarming the chest will not automatically unlock it.

Monsters will “path-find” better and will react to combat situations more intelligently. The net effect of monster AI will be that monsters will be more difficult and challenging to fight. The exact reactions monsters can have will not be detailed. Players will need to learn monsters’ behavior through fighting them and watching their reactions.
<p><b>Changes To Skill Gain</b>
<p>The rate at which non-difficulty based skills gain will be further increased and will not be affected by the skill usage table.  
<br><br>
In addition, certain “secondary” skills will raise when using a skill associated with it (similar to the way tactics increases while using a combat skill).  You will need to mark a skill as “up” in order for it raise in this manner.
<ul>
<li>Evaluate Intelligence can raise when Magery is used.
<li>Anatomy can raise when either a melee skill or the healing skill is used.
<li>Lumberjacking can raise when using an axe in melee.
<li>Armslore can raise when Wrestling is used.
<li>Meditation can raise whenever mana is regenerated.
<li>Hiding can raise when Stealthing.
<li>Detect Hidden can raise when attempting to pick a lock when a chest is trapped or when disarming a trap.
<li>Animal Lore can raise when attempting to Tame.
</ul>
<p><b>Houses</b>
<p>Changes and enhancements to houses to facilitate the map expansion and allow more players to own a house. 
<br><br>
<b>One house per account per shard</b><br>
If any character on an account already owns a house on a shard, players will not be able to place a house or transfer a house to a character on that account on that shard.  Players who already will own more than one house on an account will not have to give any of them up, unless they wish to place a new house (see “New House Placement” below).
<br><br>
<b>New House Placement</b><br>
Players who already own a house who wish to place another house will be able to do so.  When a new house is placed, all other existing houses on the same shard that belong to characters on that account will no longer be refreshable.  This will allow the player to transfer their items from the old house(s) to the new one.
<p><b>Shopkeeper Changes</b>
<ul>
<li>NPC shopkeepers will no longer have colored sandals.  Evil NPC Mages will carry these items.
<li>NPC shopkeepers will give a murder count when they die unless they are criminal or evil.  The issue with murder counts from NPCs not decaying (as reported on Siege Perilous) will also be addressed.
<li>If a shopkeeper is killed, a new shopkeeper will appear as soon as another player (other than the one that killed it) approaches.
<li>Any shopkeeper that is currently [invulnerable] will lose that status except for stablemasters.
</ul>
<p><b>Bank Checks</b>
<p>Bank checks will allow players to carry around large sums of gold to facilitate secure trading.
<br><br>
To get a bank check:
<ul>
<li>Go to the banker and say, “check #” where “#” is the amount of gold you wish the check to be worth (up to 60,000).  
<li>If you have the gold specified in your bank, a bank check of that value will be placed in your bank box and the gold will be removed.  
<li>The bank check will look like a scroll.  When single clicked, the check will tell you its value.
<li>If you do not have enough gold in your bank, you will receive a message letting you know the check was not created.
</ul>
To redeem a bank check:
<ul>
<li>Drag the bank check onto a banker.
<li>If you have enough room in your bank box, the banker will take the check and place the gold in your bank.
<li>If you do not have enough room in your bank box, the banker will take the check and place as much gold in your bank as he can.  The remaining gold will be given back to you in the form of a new bank check.
</ul>
All bank checks are “blessed” which means they cannot be looted or stolen.  Bank checks cannot be used to purchase items from NPC or player vendors.
<p><b>New Login Features</b>
<p>The log in menus of the Ultima Online client will be improved to include more options.
<br><br>
<b>Log in with Last Character</b><br>
This option will appear where the “save password” option currently is, provided that you have unchecked the save password option. Checking “Log in With Last Character” will automatically log in the character you last logged out with after you have entered your password.
<br><br>
<b>Tutorial Option</b><br>
“Young” players will have the option of entering the tutorial (to be detailed at a later date) instead of creating a character.  This option will be available after they create a character as well.

These items are now <a href="http://update.uo.com/next.html">In Testing</a>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><b>Trade Window Changes</b>
<BR>
<BR>
Trade windows will become more secure.<ul><li>You will not be able to trade a trapped item.<li>You will not be able to trade an item that was recently stolen.<li>You will not be able to trade items to a player if that player cannot hold the items.<ul><li>If the items are too heavy for the player or if the items would exceed the number of items the player can carry, the trade will fail.

However, you will still be able to rearrange items in your own pack during the trade.</ul>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Animal and Monster Spawn Phase II</b>
<BR>
<BR>
Untamed monsters and animals in houses will “die” after a certain amount of time. These monsters and animals will be eligible for “death”, within a given amount of time, under the following circumstances: <ul><li>If the monster/animal is not targeted. <li>If the monster/animal does not receive or deliver damage.</ul>
<BR>
<BR>
 <b>Pet Loyalty Duration</b>
<BR>
<BR>
Pets will remain loyal much longer than they did in the past. Pets will remain loyal for over 24 hours. </I>
<br><br>
<b>Guild Stone Changes</b><br><br>
Guild Stones will be modified to enhance their functionality and efficiency. The system that controls Guild Stones has been modified to facilitate future enhancements. While most of these changes will be transparent to the players, there will also be some changes to the guild interface at the same time.
<br><br>
<b>The War Menu</b><br>
The War Menu will have a new option in the main menu of the Guild Stone. It can only be accessed by the Guild Master. The menu has the following options:
<ul>
<li>Declare war by name
<ul>
<li>The Guild Master will be able to enter the name of the opposing guild. 
<li>The system will do a name lookup and try to pull a match or a close match. 
<li>The Guild Master will then be given a display of the matches and close matches to the name entered. 
<li>Choosing one of the names on this list will send a war invitation to that guild.
<li>A guild may only have up to 12 wars declared and not accepted at any given time.
<ul>
<li>Once a war is accepted by the other guild, the Guild Master may declare another war if he chooses to.
</ul></ul>
<li>Accept War invitations (if any exist)
<ul>
<li>A menu will be displayed allowing the Guild Master to accept any war invitations they currently have.
<li>A guild many only have up to 12 wars declared on them and not accepted.
<ul>
<li>If a 13th war is declared on the guild, the first invitation will be scrolled off the list.
<li>There is no limit to the total number of wars a guild may take part in.
</ul></ul>
<li>Decline War invitations (if any exist)
<ul>
<li>A menu will be displayed allowing the Guild Master to decline any war invitations they currently have.
</ul>
<li>Rescind War declarations (if any exist)
<ul>
<li>A menu will be displayed allowing the Guild Master to take back any war invitations they sent to other guilds.
</ul>
<li>Sue for peace (if any wars exist)
<ul>
<li>A menu will be displayed with all of the guilds the Guild Master's guild is currently at war with. The Guild Master can then choose to stop the war using this option.
</ul>
</ul>
<b>Changing the Guild Type</b><br>
Revisions will be made to guild stones to address issues with changing the guild type (Order, Chaos, Neutral). A warning window will also alert you if a guild type change is already in progress when you try to change the guild type again. This window will include:
<ul>
<li>A message telling you how long you have to wait until the current change takes effect.
<li>The option to either accept or cancel the change request.
<ul>
<li>Clicking “accept” will bring up the menu listing the guild types.
<li>Clicking “cancel” will bring you back to the guild stone menu and will not reset the current guild stone change timer.
</ul></ul>
<b>Guild Stone Decay</b><br>
Guild stones will decay in approximately one week if they are not in a house. 
<ul>
<li>Guild members will be messaged each time they log in if their stone is subject to decay.
<li>The guild master of a guild will need turn the guild stone into a "teleport stone" before it decays.
</ul></ul>
<b>Recruiting</b><br>
Guild Masters who recruit guild members will no longer have to accept them. If a Guild Master selects a member for candidacy, that member will be accepted automatically.
<br><br>
<b>Auto-cleanup</b><br>
Characters in guilds that no longer exist will now be "cleaned up" and able to join other guilds automatically.<br><br> 
<b>Fealty Calculation</b><br>
The fealty calculation for guildstones will be made more efficient to alleviate the delay in shard start-up times.<br><br>
<b>Pet Changes</b><br><br>
Various fixes and enhancements to pets.
<ul>
<li>Pack horses now have their packs on them when they die.
<li>Pet transfers will perform the loyalty checks before the transfer window appears.
<li>Friends of a pet will have a slightly more difficult time issuing commands to the pet.
<li>Pack animals and horses will no longer say [tame] above them twice.
<li>Horses and pack horses that go wild (and have had two or fewer previous owners) can be retamed and controlled by any of the original owners without any added difficulty.
<li>Transferring a pet will no longer increase the difficulty in controlling the pet. However, if the transferred pet goes wild or is released, it will still incur the penalty for two previous owners.
<li>When a pet that has had previous owners is retamed, the tamer has a chance, based on the tamer’s animal lore skill, of calming the pet down. A calmed pet's difficulty to control is the same as if it had had one fewer owner. The difficulty will never be reduced below the pet's original difficulty.
<li>Starting loyalty of tamed pets is now slightly higher. This will prevent pets from going wild instantly on a failed command.
<li>Failed pet transfers will now impact the creature's loyalty less.
<li>Pets who are automatically controlled without any taming or lore skill (horses, pack animals, and dogs, for instance) will no longer gain loyalty when issued a successful command.
<li>The messages have been restored when you have no chance of taming a creature.
</ul><br><br> 
<b>NPC and Monster Changes</b><br><br>
Changes will be made to various NPCs and Monsters that will have the following affects:
<ul>
<li>NPCs will now train the appropriate skills when asked. Some NPCs will now train different skills than they previously and will list all skills they can train when asked, “train”
<li>You will no longer get the item “a scroll”.
<li>Monster treasure will be revamped. Most monsters will not carry backpacks, and some monsters will carry different treasure than they have previously. 
<li>Some NPCs will now carry items more appropriate to their jobs (beware of merchants with trapped boxes!)
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>Moonstones</b><br><br>
Moonstones will be found on various monsters. The exact nature and functionality of these items will be detailed at a later time.<br><br>
<b>Moongates</b><br><br>
Single clicking the left mouse button on a moongate will give you a description of what lies through the gate. This will allow you to know where the gate is currently going without having to jump through them over and over again until you reach your destination. This will help improve server performance as less players will need to “jump” through moongates.<br><br>
<b>Recall Scroll Fix</b><br><br>
You will no longer use more than one recall scroll when recalling off of a boat key. <br><br>

let me just say that moonstones usually were closely connected to the moongates throughout the Ultima series.
