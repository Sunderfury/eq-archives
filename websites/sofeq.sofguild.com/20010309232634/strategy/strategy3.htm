Ok folks, for all of you hailing from the city of Freeport, here's my novice tips (levels 6 through 14). </P>







<P>1. Learn the basics of group hunting, as you will need a group to continue progressing at a good pace. Observe loot orders, and always say please when requesting for heals or buffs, from&nbsp;&nbsp; group members or just players in your immediate area. Nothing is more annoying to other players than a new acquaintance grabbing the loot each time there is a kill, so beware. :-)&nbsp; </P>







<P>Familiarize yourself with the zone your group will be hunting on. at this intermediate level, North Ro, East Commonlands and West Commonlands are probably going to be your frequent haunts for a while. Learn where the zone exits are so you can head to it in case of trouble. This is where sense heading helps a lot. If you know the right direction, you can run to it, if not, run to any direction, keep doing sense heading until u find your bearings, and turn accordingly. Don't hesitate to ask for help when you are in trouble, on the screen you are on. Most players will gladly slay whatever crit is bothering you if you ask for help. </P>







<P>Tagging is another technique you need to master in hunting with groups. Whether you become a designated &quot;bait&quot; or not, it is important to understand what your role is. As bait, you should get the appropriate monster, and head back to where your group is, remembering to yell &quot;incoming &quot; as appropriate, prior to engaging your quarry. As part of the group waiting to ambush the monster being lured, be attentive about the &quot;incoming&quot; message and scan around you to determine where your friend is going to come from. Sometimes, the &quot;bait&quot; will have taken significant damage and may need heals, or someone else to take the brunt of the angered creatures attacks as he re-joins the group. </P>







<P>Know your part and play it well, your groupmates' lives and well-being depend on it. If you are a bard like me, try to sing the &quot;healing song&quot; (level 6 song) at all times when engaged in combat. This helps everyone all around. If someone gets low, they can back up and disengage, and get healed up by your songs, or even by a cleric if you have one in the group. They can then re-engage and take up &quot;tank&quot; role when someone else gets lower and has to back up. At 3 bubs down, make sure you let your group member &quot;back up&quot;. Sometimes,in the heat of battle, you'd be amazed how many people forget about their health bars, hehe. Oh, and if the &quot;tank&quot; is in front of you, and you are hitting the creature too, you might have to go around to make sure the &quot;tank&quot; can back up. Zack had trouble backing up one night with me right behind him. Hehe, what can you expect from a short dwarf? (no offense, Zack :-) ) </P>







<P>2. Raising money Well, I haven't really taken the time to take up smithing just yet. So let me tell you how I do it, and you be the judge if it will work for you. From level 4, I started fishing a lot. Fishing allowed me to take time out from hunting, raise my sense heading and other non-melee skills (like singing, stringed and percussion), while making enough money without risks of dying :-) Besides, it was also a good time to catch up on friends, new and old ones, alike. Nothing cheers me more than to find fellow SoFers gaining a level from the last time I checked, and congratulating them with a surprise &quot;WTG!&quot; hehe. Making money out of your group kills from levels 6 through 8 is going to be a little tough. Depending on the size of your group, you might find netting less than 1 plat for a 4&nbsp; hour session or so, but the xp you can get is well worth it. </P>







<P>Like Aileron said, dont worry too much about money if you are in a group, you are primarily there for the xp. From a spending standpoint, Bards are like the worst, hehe. You spend money on songs, instruments and armor, LOL.&nbsp; Not like warriors or wizards, hehe. I'll let you in on a little secret, hehe. At level 7, anything in the newbie area of North Ro I can pretty much kill with 1 or 2 blows. They are all green, but I get the loot from those quick kills. So, on a slow night, when I can't find a group or something, just try about 2 hours of power looting spiderlings, beetles and skeletons. You'd be amazed at how much you can make in 2 hours, rather than spending it&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking for a partner and ending up wasting your valuable online time. One night, I got a skellie carrying a cracked staff, hehe... sold it to NPC for almost 1 plat (!!). As a rule, if you see a skellie with a weapon, kill it, hehe. Weapon will get you between 1-4 gold easily enough. And at level 2 or 3, you can pretty much kill a skellie, hehe. That is, decaying skeleton. THERE ARE higher level skellies, so don't forget to consider them! (not in North Ro newbie area tho) </P>







<P>3. Learning more about the game The most experience people on the game are usually very helpful. From finding out&nbsp; where certain places are, to what kind of armor you should be wearing, to what skills you should develop for your class. At level 7, I chanced upon&nbsp; a level 9 bard who was on since phase 1 beta. She taught me a lot about playing bards, and adventuring in general. I was very grateful for her tips and kept up tabs with her, letting her know how helpful they've been and that I really appreciated it! Bards are ideal for playing &quot;bait&quot; at higher levels. One thing I picked up is using 1 practice point on throwing skills, and always loading up with 40 shurikens (20 on range weapon slot, 20 on ammo slot). To tag, I put my running song on, come up close to a good critter, con it, yell &quot;incoming&quot; and press my hot button for range attack. Then I high tail back to group. Regardless of critter, I can usually make it back without getting hit, and therefor not have to worry about getting a substitute tank when the group engages. Remember, even at low throwing skills, creature will still go for you on a missed throw, hehe. </P>







<P>4. Killer NPC's Pretty much any area you can go to after level 6 to gain xp's will have killer NPC's. In the East Commonlands area, Griffin's are pretty much the big killers. The are a little slow, but if they chance upon you, you will almost always have no time to react. At level 6 or so, with a full patchwork armor, it only takes a Griffin a max of 2 hits to kill me, hehe. About 90+ per hit, LOL. You can usually spot a griffin from afar, just&nbsp; make sure u give them a wide berth and prepare to bolt to the nearest zone, when they are around. </P>







<P>In the North Ro area, there are madmen and Dorn (a dark elf NPC that kills any race but dark elves). Madmen are levels 10 through 15, I think. And Dorn's are levels 16 through 20. If&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something is about 3 levels above you, they will probably dispose of you quick, so remember where that zone is, and run like there's no tomorrow, hehe. Shrivelled mummies are bad, too, but they are pretty slow, hehe. In case you are wondering, </P>







<P>Sand Giants are over 30+. I got hit by one this morning when some nasty person got mad when we wouldn't let him join our group, as we were waiting for Dervs. Short story is I knew the person from before, and I knew he always acted like a jerk. Anyways, this person happened to be a level 10 Druid, he cast camouflage and spirit of the wolf on himself, tagged a sand giant and ran back to us. Without us knowing any better. Next thing I know, I get hit for 78, I get a /t of &quot;die you A**H***&quot; (fill in the blanks, hehe) and I started running like a madman, hehe. I immediately filed up a complaint about the person, so I am hoping he will either calm down some or get banned altogether. Training Sand Giants for malicious intent is a bannable offense, from what I've heard. And yes, a level 10 Bard can outrun a 30+ mad, Sand Giant with the &quot;running song&quot; on, and not even playing the drums, hehe. And you wonder why I'm having so much fun playing this toon? </P>







<P>Anyways, for those of you who are far above me, I apologize if my &quot;tips&quot; aren't that much helpful to those who are already way higher than I am. I hope that 1 or 2&nbsp; persons can benefit from this, though. </P>







<P>Good journeys to all of you! Wish me luck and wish for me not to miss a note in my songs when need is greatest! :-)</P>







<P>Sincerely,</P>
