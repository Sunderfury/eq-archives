If you are looking for small raw hide armor..&nbsp; I have the place for you..&nbsp; If you are in the Kaladim area..&nbsp; There are orc oracles and Cents there that often carry small raw hide as treasures! *I got every stitch of my raw hide armor there for free*&nbsp; There is a tower where they spawn..&nbsp; This is a pretty popular place, with only three spawning in rotation..&nbsp; But most ppl will welcome someone into their group and split the looting process..&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>Ok, where this place is..</P>







<P>If you are coming from the Greater Faydark zone..&nbsp; follow the path just past what is

referred to by other players as,&nbsp; The two houses..&nbsp; You can sell here and buy some items,&nbsp; unfortunately food and water is not offered here..&nbsp;&nbsp; Just past the two houses, still on the path..&nbsp; you'll see a lil ravine.. or whatever you call it..&nbsp; an indent =D&nbsp; to your right..&nbsp; follow the mountain on the right.. you'll pass a pretty cool look'n white/yellow pillar..&nbsp; keep to your right.. nothing spawns here as of yet, that we all know of..&nbsp; you'll soon come to a huge gray pillar, Orc Tower..&nbsp; One orc spawns in the back.. and two right in front of the pillar..&nbsp; IF!&nbsp; you get into trouble.. the only place for you to run to for help is either back to the greater

Faydark zone.. *run to the road and go left* or..&nbsp; run to the path and go right to the guard shack..&nbsp; it's a lil jaunt.. so be sure you're not about to die..&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>Now.. to the left of that white/yellow pillar is a bandit camp..&nbsp; good exp there..&nbsp; but mostly you just get their tongues

*yuuuuck*&nbsp; as treasure..&nbsp; these are for some quest that I have yet to figure out..&nbsp; I just put them in the bank and give them to ppl who are looking for the tongues..&nbsp; The bandits have names.. first and last..&nbsp; and yup.. they are a good fight.. and tend to gang up on you.. so do not go there alone.. </P>







<P>The only things you really wanna try to avoid in Butcher Block are the two Ogres that spawn from time to time..&nbsp; Corflunk and Zarchoomi..&nbsp; you'll hear someone shout Cornflake is out!!&nbsp; If you are at orc tower, you are pretty safe.. most ppl will lead him or his sister Zarchoomi, down the path&nbsp; to be killed by the guards..&nbsp; These ogres are between level 6 and 9, respectively..&nbsp;&nbsp; but pack a mean punch..&nbsp; As treasures,&nbsp; they always give a Lore item..&nbsp; their head ;-)&nbsp; Yup, another quest item.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>Another place in BB zone *butcherblock*&nbsp; is the Chessboard. This place is really cool look'n!&nbsp; Yuuup.. looks just like a chessboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; only it has huuuge Undead Pawns, Bishops, Rooks, Knights and the King..&nbsp; *skeletons*&nbsp;&nbsp; Treasure here really stinks..&nbsp; But..&nbsp; it is nice exp and about the only place for a level 10 plus, to get decent exp without great fear of death..&nbsp;&nbsp; it is best to group up here..&nbsp; as it too is a busy place..&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>Another thing you can kill that is worth the effort sometimes.. are Krag Elders..&nbsp; if it has a weapon..&nbsp; it just might be bronze&nbsp; =)&nbsp;&nbsp; I have gotten several bronze weapons from them..&nbsp;&nbsp; not magic users,&nbsp; they just wack away at you and of course.. stun is one side effect..&nbsp; The Lowland Basilisk are toughies..&nbsp;&nbsp; so be warned..&nbsp; they have stone breath and tend to use that stunning spell a LOT..&nbsp; they bite hard too..&nbsp; even if it cons a weaker blue to you.. expect a good fight.. but most times you get their tongue as a treasure..&nbsp; *what is it with dwarves and tongues?*&nbsp; and that sells for at least one gold =) </P>
