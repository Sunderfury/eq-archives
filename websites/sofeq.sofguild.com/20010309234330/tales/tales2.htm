Hello everyone! I thought I'd share with you one of the most awesome dungeon experiences I've had in this game.&nbsp; I am by no means a good storyteller, so please forgive me if I fail miserably in describing this journey of mine.&nbsp; This trip took place in a dungeon in the West

Commonlands, a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place filled with vile undead creatures and death awaiting the unwary adventurer in each corner.</P>







<P>&nbsp;It was not a disaster though, like most trips to Befallen are. We went there feeling we could clean up the whole place. Befallen is divided into 3 levels, obviously, the 3rd level is where the big bad meanies are. The thing with befallen though, if you are not careful, you might find yourself in level 3 without actually PLANNING to go in there, which is EXACTLY what happened to our party that night..... </P>







<P>In a previous trip to Befallen, our party has acquired the key to the second level, so that night we decided, we'll do the 2nd level and if we get a key to the 3rd level, we'll go take a peek at level 3. Before we went in, I warned the folks in my group to be careful entering doorways since there is a door with a hole right behind it and if you fall, you'll find yourself in level with no keys and no hope of survival unless you can take on ice bone skellies, ghouls and other magic-only mobs by yourself. Well guess what? One of our group members, didn't heed my warning and not 15 minutes inside the dungeon, we heard a thud and the sound of injured falling. Yuuuppp...she fell down the hole. Now there were 4 of us in the group, me, Stormsilver (paladin), Sircrux (warrior) and Lilgrid (cleric), average level is about 20. Well Sircrux is not gonna leave Stormsilver alone in that floor, so he jumped in the hole to &quot;protect&quot; her. I was rolling my eyes, and like &quot;Sheesh guys, can't we just stop here and think about the situation for a minute?&quot;&nbsp; We're all &quot;newbs&quot; in Befallen, but I read a lot of stories, so I kinda know what the smart and dumb thing to do. I promptly cast Invis to Undead on both so they don't get attacked while we plan our strategy. They are right under the hole so I can still cast a spell on them. </P>







<P>Ok, so there we were, 2 folks trapped in level 3 without a key going to level 2, and Lilgrid and I on level 1. I knew we have to get a key somewhere but was not sure if it is in level 2 or level 1. I did not want just myself and Lilgrid to go down level 2 and hunt for the L3 key.&nbsp; Fortunately, another friend of mine was online so I was able to ask him the location of the L3 key. It turned out to be in the hands of an Ogre Shadowknight in level 1.&nbsp; We were able to kill it and get the keys. </P>







<P>Now a decision. Do I give the key to our cleric, and he goes down with them and leave them alone to fight their way back up? I think not.&nbsp; But if we die in level 3, the whole night will be spent marshalling enough people to clear the way going back and loot our corpses, (which&nbsp; has a remote chance of happening). I was not afraid for myself though, since I have invis to undead and the Ogre SK, I could probably defeat naked to retrieve a second set of keys. Nice thing about Paladins at my level, I can conjure a magic hammer and a magic headband that gives out light like a greater lightstone. So I won't exactly be totally unequipped when I die, plus with invisi to undead, I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could walk past most mobs without being attacked. </P>







<P>To make a long story short, I said what the heck, have to stick with my friends and help them or die trying, such is the life of a noble&nbsp; Paladin.&nbsp; So Lilgrid and I jumped in. Lilgrid was not worried cause he can &quot;Gate&quot;.. (dang those magic users LOL). So instead of going from level 1 to 2 then 3, we were kinda forced to do level 3 to 2 to 1. </P>







<P>Oh boy! That room was eeeriee!!!!! You hear mummies moaning, necro theurgist casting there spells, ghouls howling....it literally made my hair rise. Awesome dungeon, dark hallways, scary sound effects makes your heart pound. As expected, high level undead blocked our way. Feelings of sadness and fear surrounded our party as we saw several corpses of players littering the floor. I remember seeing someone's corpse at least 5 times, on 5 different places!! Must have died a lot trying to go back to the place where he originally died.&nbsp; Things did not look good, but our party was resolved in getting out of that accursed dungeon alive. ;-) </P>







<P>Anyways, we fought and fought and fought, our health going down to 2 bubbles most of the time and our cleric ran out of mana several times too trying to keep us alive. Several times, I had to &quot;spook the dead&quot; (a paladin/cleric spell) to make 'em run for 30 seconds to give us a breather while we heal and our cleric meditate. And then FINALLY!! we got to the door leading to level 2. A few more mummies,&nbsp; dread bones and necromancer battles, but got through them also and then we found the door to level 1!! So we were like &quot;Whew!! OMG that was so awesome!!&quot; </P>







<P>That's not the end of the story though. On our trek back up the dungeon, we got really good loot. I think we found 2 Bronze two handed swords, Bronze Battle Axe, lots of platinum coins, jewels, etc. So, we got cocky and greedy *hehehehe* Who doesn't wanna see a 3 digit platinum figure in the bank anyways? *LOL* So we decided to go back..... I had a feeling that we should not push our luck, but we got through ok to where we were on level 3 back to level 1 so we knew we could do a repeat of what happened. So we opened the door to level 2..... </P>







<P>Okay so there we were, all buffed up ready to go deep in the dungeon once more. Like the last time, level 2 was a piece of cake. We quickly dispatched all the undead mobs and necros locking the way to level 3. There was also 2 nakkie players following us, presumably &quot;getting a ride&quot; so they can get back to there bodies. </P>







<P>Now it's level 3 again. The prize for cleaning up level 3 is getting to the Shadowknight that sometimes yield the Bone Bladed Claymore, a magical 2HS weapon. It is a nice prize, players buy em for at least 200p, so we really want to get one. Hehe nothing like a 50p profit from running one dungeon. But anyways..... </P>







<P>Now one thing bad about having an invisi to undead spell is that you become the &quot;scout&quot;. *LOL* I don't mind though because I kinda think I'm the most appropriate person in our party to do scouting duties. hehehe... so I cast invisi to undead on myself and went on ahead.&nbsp; It's so nice being able to stand next to an undead mob and check it out first... it also allowed me to check the various passageways to see if there are others waiting to ambush us. So we arrived at this HUGE room with 4 doorways. The room contained a Necro Theurgist, his pet, 2 ice bones, and 2 greater skellies. It's a suicide if we go charging in and taking all 6 mobs. Well again, my Paladin spells came in handy as I was able to &quot;Lull&quot; 4 of the monsters and we dispatched the Necro and his pet, before we did the others one a time. So there, the room was &quot;clean&quot;. Now we decide which way to go, since there are 3 doors available to us. (The 4th was where we came in). </P>







<P>We chose to take the door to our right, again me scouting ahead. Eyes bulged as I saw 2 ghouls holding bronze weapons. Those babies sell for 6plat a piece!! So I came back to the large room and informed my party that we should go that way and kill the ghouls. So we went. 2 ghouls are &quot;easy&quot; for us. All of us have combine weapons and with 2 Paladins and a dual-wielding warrior, all with double attack, it shouldn't be a problem... </P>







<P>Then something went wrong.....deadly wrong..... </P>







<P>Slash, Kick, Bash...slash, kick, bash... the ghouls were losing, and we were excited about claiming our bronze weapon loot when the ghouls started to ran away back to the large room!! I was able to cast &quot;Root&quot; on one ghoul to keep it from running but when I tried to do the same on the other, it was too late, it has moved too far and out of range. The ghoul opened the door leading back to the room, and there waiting for us was the Necro we killed already. It RESPAWNED already!! Well I knew it wasn't good when we all got blasted in succession by Poison Bolts, Disease Cloud, and whatever else Area Effect spells those blasted Necromancers have. Our health bars quickly went down to 50% and we found ourselves fighting for our lives. The ghouls also have regened most of their health and was back in the fray. I hastely typed in &quot;RETREAT!! GO BACK TO FIRST DOOR!!&quot; but the ghouls cast the GhoulRoot spell and our cleric and warrior friend were stuck and could not move. Then the Necromancer cast Heat Blood...oowwwweeess..nothing like seeing a message&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Your blood simmers&quot; to make you wanna cry and panic shouting for HELP!!!. Now that is a nasty, nasty, nasty spell because it is what you call Periodic Damage or DoT spell (Damage over Time). If it isn't dispelled, it will continue to kill you. </P>







<P>Our cleric (Lilgrid) cast the Cancel Magic or whatever to get rid of the Heat Blood effect but that left him out of mana, so he was reduced to fighting back with his staff. Well clerics aren't known for their melee skills so you can pretty much guess what will happen to him. In the meantime I was trying to keep Sircrux alive, healing him while he is being pounded by the 2 ghouls until the GhoulRoot spell runs out. Finally, we were able to move again and ran back towards the first door... our healths dangerously low. Storm was down to less than 2 bubbles, Sircrux was about half, since I was healing him. I was about 60% and Lilgrid being low health to start with, was down to 1 bubble.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>Now that was not the worst part. The 2 ghouls were finally killed (unfortunately no time to loot) and we gained the upperhand. I think Sircrux and I (being with still decent health) could kill the Necromancer and we can regroup outside the room and recuperate, but while all of this was happening, the ice bone skellies respawned so we knew that it was a lost cause and just have to run and make it to the door leading to the upper levels with an undead train behind us. </P>







<P>I called for &quot;TOTAL RETREAT!!&quot; and we ran back to the door but our cleric got hit once more and he was doing the &quot;friendly walk&quot;&nbsp; Stormsilver did a &quot;Lay On Hands&quot; to save him and Sircrux was fumbling for the keys to open the friggin' locked door to level 2. So there I was trying to fend off the ice skellies so my party can have time to escape, I was very low on mana too, and I did not want to cast a healing spell anymore as that will totally sucked me dry and I was saving that for a &quot;Spook The Dead&quot; spell. Well as you might or might&nbsp; not know, mobs in dungeon respawn so when you go back the way you came, all those that you have killed would have respawned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; already and they will join the train following ya. </P>







<P>&nbsp;We got through the L3 door and saw my party running up the stairs and I did an about face and run to follow them. Now it was my turn to get clobbered. I was stunned as I was climbing the stairs and did the &quot;whirling&quot; thing. (I'm sure you know what that is *LOL*). I fell off the stairs, took 30 damage from the fall and so I was left behind with 4, maybe 5 undead mobs on me..... </P>







<P>I knew I was gonna die.....a horrible death at level 3 in Befallen. Even with &quot;Lay On Hands&quot; I knew I still could not make it alive since more undead mobs were joining the train and I do not have the keys to open the door from level 2 to level 1!! So I thought to myself,&nbsp; &quot;Well, I don't wanna die this deep, I'll just go up as far as I could so I can retrieve my corpse easier&quot; I quickly targeted the ice bone skellies, which were the tough mobs and &quot;Spooked&quot; them. One Ice bone ran away but one resisted. Also ran out of mana. I was able to get my bearings and I ran up the stairs, trying to avoid falling again. I was very very close to dying, and my chest was literally pounding..&nbsp;&nbsp; I mustered all the concentration I could get and ran like a madman through the hallways going back to the level 2 door. Well since I have an undead train of mobs behind me, I get whacked every now and then, so my health is inching to half a bubble where I will do the &quot;friendly walk&quot;... finally the ice bone skellie who resisted my Spook spell got a good 24 dmg hit on me so I had to do my &quot;Lay On Hands&quot;. Was back to 100% health but still out of mana, and no more LOH for 24 Norrathian hours. Now the train is like 7 or 8 undead, didn't bother to count but I'm sure it's at least that hehehehe.... </P>







<P>I got to the door but of course it closed and is locked again. No keys, so I called to my party to help me and come back open the door. I said &quot;Help me guys...2 minutes or I'm dead!!&quot;. Our cleric finally was able to meditate a few mana to heal Sircrux to about 60% health and he came back for me.&nbsp; With my back pressed against the door, I kept slashing and bashing on the weaker undead, some of them conned green so I was able to kill 2 of them. But I am badly outnumbered and even though most of the green cons keep missing me, the blue cons are getting good hits. Again I was back to about 30% health and just hoping that Sircrux can get back in time to open the door&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that I have enough health to make it back to level 1.... </P>







<P>Heard a door creak ..THERE!! IT OPENED!! and there I saw my party with about 4 or 5 other players waiting outside the door ready to kill the train... I scooted out the room and a high elf cleric healed me while the rest of the gang pounded on the undead that was killing me... </P>







<P>So there...end of story.. I lived. =D =D It wasn't a good second trip to Befallen that night...but we survived.. surely an awesome and scary experience that will have me dreaming nightmares in the days to come *LOL* </P>







<P>Can't wait to go back.... anyone wanna come with us? hehehehe</FONT></td>
