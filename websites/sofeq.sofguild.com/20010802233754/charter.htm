          rank, age, gender, etc.&nbsp; SoF will always stand for helping
          others, friendship, camaraderie among its members, and having fun. We

          <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Tahoma">A member is
          considered Active if they play EverQuest regularly.&nbsp; All active
          members are expected to attend the scheduled meetings.&nbsp; If a
          member can never (or very rarely) attend meetings, he or she is
          supposed to inform the Royal Scribe or the Prince/Princess with
          the&nbsp;reason why they are unable to attend (e.g. work, not home,
          time difference, etc.). <o:p>

          unable to play EverQuest for an extended period of time, but wishes to
          remain a member, he or she may request to be placed on LEAVE OF ABSENCE
          (LOA) status, by notifying the Queen or the Prince/Princess.<br>
          Any member that has not attended a guild activity (in EverQuest or any
          other SoF chapter, e.g. The Realm) for a period of 60 consecutive days
          will be placed on INACTIVE status.&nbsp; The Royal Scribe will then
          notify the member by e-mail informing of their new status and the
          member must respond to the e-mail within 30 days whether they wish to
          change their status to LOA or be dropped from the roster.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Failure to do so may result to termination of guild membership.<o:p>
