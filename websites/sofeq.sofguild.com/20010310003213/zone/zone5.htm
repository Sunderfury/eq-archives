	There I was... Kelethin... sitting in the favorite chair of my favorite Kelethin inn (I have many favorites. hehe) and this lad strolls up to me like he had known me since we were beardless

    children.&nbsp;</font>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">&quot;Sir Dwarf," he says with a smile.  I knew right then he was probably a bard.  Everyone I know with that 'I just killed an orc' grin	 are bards. "What can you tell me about Kaladim?"</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">I looked the lad over a bit while I finished my Ale, and started another.  He looked as young as young could get with his worn dusty old cloth shirt, and his sword didn't even look used.  Was that a price tag I saw?<br>

	Now... I have been to Kelethin many times, and I still am amazed at several things.  For instance, how do these blasted elves keep from falling to their death after a few Dwarven Ales?  My answer to that is that elves can't handle

    Dwarven Ale, but I'm sure my Elvin guild mates would take difference to that.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The other question that nags at my brain is how these elves can stand not having beards!  Gods, that would drive me as insane as one of the Madmen of the Ro desert.

    I noticed him staring at me patiently as I polished off that second Ale and ordered another.  "Was I ever that young," I thought to myself. "Of course not. I was born old."&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">I took a sip from the third ale. "Ya wanna know about Kaladim, eh lad?"<br>

	"Yes, sir, if you would be so kind. I have some mail to deliver there from my guild."

    "Humph.. a bard. I knew it. When did the bards start going to Kaladim? Oh well, never mind. Sit down and buy me another Ale, and I'll tell ya all about my town.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">"Kaladim is a wonderful place, lad. Ya can find almost everything ya need there.  I say almost, because I'll be the first to admit that ya can't get smithing supplies there.  Now.. don't look at me like that, youngster, or I'll throw

    you off the platform.  I know we dwarves are miners and smiths and such, but we felt the gnomes needed some business so we let them sell us ore from the mills in the Steamfont Mountains.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">"Anyways... where was I? Oh yes... my fourth ale. The outside is the best place to start, since you'll see it first naturally.  There are some huts there that have a few items of interest.  Armor molds, baking supplies, and so on.  I'd say check it out before you get go inside.

    "Now, when you get to the gates be sure to say Hail to the guards.  They will be your best friends if you choose to hunt near there.  Those lads are good at taking care of annoying critters trying to knife you in the back.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">"When you pass the first gate, you'll enter South Kaladim.  A good place to shop for weapons, armor, and so on.  Talk to ole Tumpy, and tell him Dakmer sent you.  He'll get ya a good Ale.  In South Kaladim you'll also find the Arena, and the warrior guild.  I remember seeing the bard mail-man there as well.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">"North Kaladim is probably the busiest place.  The bank is located there, as well as the Mines, Everhot's Forge, and guilds for the Rogues, Paladins, and my guild, the Clerics."&nbsp;</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">"Ah.... another Ale.  Thanks, lad."  Maybe this young one wasn't such a hopeless case.

    "If you want to hunt around the Gates, it's not a bad place for one of your experience.  There are many snakes, bats, and accursed decaying skeletons to slay.  The goblin whelps are also good hunting as they will often have coin, and an occasional item.  Beware the Krag Chicks that are roaming the area.  They are a bit tougher till later."<br>

	"Once you advance a bit, try the Chicks and the skunks.  Yes, lad, I said skunks.  Quit with the looks, and remember what I said about you taking a dive off that platform outside.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">"Now... take care to remember how you get from Kelethin to Kaladim, lad, as you will pass some good hunting sites.  There's the Crossroads, the Two Huts, the Chessboard, the Orc Tower, and numerous Goblin camps.  Ask someone about those when you get to the Butcherblock Mountains."</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The young bard had been taking notes in a little journal during our chat, and he seemed satisfied at what I had told him.  He scribbled a quick closing, then stood to leave.</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">"Thank you, sir, for your information will greatly help my travels."<br>

	"May Brell guide you on your way," I said as I waved spells of Holy Armor and Center on him.  "Oh... and just a word of advice, lad."<br>

	"Yes," he said as he frantically opened his notes journal.  "A word of advice is always

    useful.&quot;</font></p>

    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">I cleared my throat, and tried to sound serious.	"If you're ever in doubt... buy the dwarf another ale."

    And you know what?  He did just that.&nbsp;<br>

	We sat there for the better part of an evening drinking Ale, and telling jokes.  After about twenty or thirty more Ales I carried the passed-out youth to an room in the inn, and went about my business with a smile hidden behind my beard.<br>
