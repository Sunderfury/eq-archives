<font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This is my favorite dungeon



in the game, which is one of the more popular hunting spots for mid-level



players. &nbsp;Most folks get intimidated here by the sheer number of mob trains



occurring, usually within 3 minutes of each other hehehe.. don't let that deter



you, all you need is to learn the zone and how to avoid them. &nbsp;I hope this



guide will prepare you a bit if you are going to hunt here for the first time.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First of all this is an



outdoor zone hence, Selo's Accelerando, Spirit of Wolf and Journeyman's Boots



work here, which is very nice when trying to run away from bad pulls or other



player's trains. &nbsp;The bad part is, if you are good-aligned, the closest



binding spots are 1 - East Freeport &nbsp;2 - The Arena (Lake Rathe).&nbsp;&nbsp;



Getting bound in East Freeport is what I recommend, even though it is farther



than the Arena, but it is the safer route if you're running back naked to Cazic



for corpse retrieval.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I suggest a level 22



minimum. &nbsp;Yes you can start as early as level 18, but getting attacked by



lizard broodlings and warriors even though they con green already is very



annoying and going within aggro radius while fighting another lizard can be



fatal, so I think it's not worth going here below level 22 as you'll probably



spending half your time zoning back to Feerrott. &nbsp;The entrance to the



Temple can be found in the south wall of the Feerrott zone. Watch out for



roaming Ogre Bouncer guards, camouflage or invisibility helps if you don't have



running speed enhancements.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Monsters here ranges



from level 12 broodlings to level 35 lizard champions, and the level 40 Avatar



of Fear. &nbsp;Most drop fine steel weapons which sell for 4pp to 6pp a piece to



vendors. &nbsp;They also drop coins up to 4pp sometimes, and the occasional



gems, research components and large cloth armor (whooopiee!!). What I don't like



about this place is that lizard warders and up, will forever be aggressive and



attack you on sight. &nbsp;Nothing more annoying that fighting &quot;green&quot;



mobs and this is a place where you'll be forced to, a lot! The following are the



estimated levels (as far as I remember hehehe) of the mobs you can find inside.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">lizard broodlings,



warriors, proselytes (cleric) - dungeon crap<br>



lizard warder - level 18-20<br>



lizard defender - level 20-24<br>



lizard sentinel - level 22-26<br>



lizard herald - level 24-28 (cleric)<br>



hulking gorilla - level 25<br>



lizard protector - level 26-30<br>



lizard justicator - level 28-32 &nbsp;(cleric)<br>

lizard judicator - level 30-34 (cleric)<br>



alligator - level 30-33<br>



lizard champion - level 35<br>



</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The reason why this is a



very popular (hence crowded) zone is because it's the only place to find



rubicite armor, which is very nice armor for rangers, shaman, and rogues who



normally can't wear platemail. &nbsp;The AC of the rubicite pieces is generally



higher than store-bought plate and it is colored red, which looks great as well.



&nbsp;The demand for these items are high and count yourself lucky if you ever



get one. &nbsp;Rubicite is dropped by the rare mobs and as expected, the spawn



spots of these mobs are heavily camped.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are:</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Tae Ew Diviner - drops



Rubicite Bracer or lizardscale mantle (lvl 25 enchanter)<br>



Tae Ew Templar - drops Rubicite Greaves or lizardscale cloak (lvl 25 enchanter)<br>



Tae Ew Archon - drops Rubicite Vambracers or lizardscale belt (lvl 35 wizard)<br>



Clay Golem - drops Lizardskin Tribal Mask or potion of earth elemental illusion



(lvl 25)<br>



Stone Golem - drops Rubicite Helm or wand of pillage enchantment (lvl 30)<br>

<p><b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">HUNTING TIPS &amp;



STRATEGIES</font></b>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Okay, so you decide that



this dungeon is interesting and you decide to brave it's depths. &nbsp;First get



a group formed, like I said minimum of level 22 is recommended. &nbsp;A 2-person



group can hunt here (not all classes though, bard and druid (from personal



experience) works out the best) but try to have at least 3 people. &nbsp;The



ideal composition is a group of 4 people consisting of 2 tanks, a nuker, and a



healer. &nbsp;</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Most of your time will



be spent in the Courtyard (commonly called the CY). &nbsp;This is where all



trains pass by as it is the first area you'd see upon entering the temple.



&nbsp;There are 2 spots where you can avoid trains, the NE corner (behind the



tree), and the SW corner (also behind the tree). &nbsp;Having a bard with group



invis is a nice to have, so when someone yells &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE!&quot; go



invis and wait for the lizard train to dissipate, or just stay in the corners



and watch the lizards trot back to where they came.&nbsp;&nbsp; DO NOT try to



pull any lizards from a train, their aggro radius is wide so unless you feel you



can handle 3 to 4 lizards at a time, I suggest you let the train pass until the



CY is free.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">These are my suggestions



for hunting spots -</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 22-30 - When you



enter the courtyard, there is a door to the right (east). &nbsp;This is a huge



maze-like room where lizard warders, defenders and sentinel roam. &nbsp;Setup in



one corner of the CY and have a tank pull lizards to your group. &nbsp;It is



easy to get lost here (#1 cause of trains from the maze) so for the first-time



puller, stay close to the maze entrance and familiarize yourself first with the



area before going deeper. &nbsp;A ranger or bard is a good choice to pull since



they have camouflage/invis and can look around a lizard to see if it has any



buddies hiding around corners that are in aggro range and would be



unintentionally pulled along.&nbsp;&nbsp; The clay golem spawns deep inside the



maze, during peak times when the maze is empty, it's easy to pull him out to the



courtyard since few or no lizards will be joining him when he runs after your



puller going back. &nbsp;If the maze is crowded, forget pulling the golem.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 28-35 - There are



4 places where you can go. &nbsp;The &quot;Throne Room&quot;,



&quot;Temple&quot;, &quot;Gator Tunnel&quot; and &quot;Sewers&quot;</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First, the Throne Room -



To the west of the courtyard, is a door leading to the throne room. &nbsp;This



is where the Diviner and Templar spawns. &nbsp;It is a heavily camped room for



obvious reasons. &nbsp;A sole group of 6 here is a must to hold it, unless there



are several groups (which is usually the case). &nbsp;You'd find all types of



lizards here, except for the broodlings, warriors, and warders, and lizard



champion. &nbsp;You'll also see 2 hulking gorillas spawn on the first floor.



&nbsp;The second floor is where the fanatics, judicators are and where the stone



golem spawns. &nbsp;That floor is very hard to clear and can only be held by a



good group of level 35ish folks.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Temple (or pyramid)



lies behind the maze, you have to go through the maze and find the stairs



leading to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Invisibility is good so you don't have to fight your



way in. &nbsp;Once in the temple, you'll be &quot;safe&quot; from lizards in the



maze.&nbsp;&nbsp; Groups usually setup in the North side of the pyramid.



&nbsp;The 4 corners of the pyramid are spawn spots, usually lizard heralds,



sentinels and protectors. &nbsp;A cleric, bard, or druid are good pullers here



to &quot;lull&quot; one of the lizards so you don't have to take 2 at a time,



unless your group can handle it. &nbsp;BEWARE of roaming lizards - fanatics,



justicars and judicators. &nbsp;The justicars and judicators cast a 250-300dmg



Wrath spell and are very deadly. &nbsp;Running away from a bad pull is difficult



since you are so far away from the zone, so a wizard or druid with evac/succor



is a nice to have. &nbsp;The pyramid is a spiral structure and you'd see lizard



heralds, protectors, fanatics, justicators, and judicators along the way.



&nbsp;At the very top is where the Tae Ew Archon spawns and it has 4 or 5 lizard



bodyguards with him. &nbsp;For level 33-35 players, the top of the pyramid is a



good place to setup and it is a fast spawning spot. &nbsp;Inside the pyramid are



pools of water full of, guess what? &nbsp;'gators =) &nbsp;These pools connect



to the gator pool found in the Sewers.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Gator Tunnel is deep in



the dungeon. &nbsp;South of the courtyard, there are 2 ladders leading to a room



with a well. &nbsp;You have to dive in the well and swim through a short



underwater pass that leads to a cave with a lake inside. &nbsp;The lake is full



of alligators, and you can pull gators from the lake and fight them in the



tunnel area. &nbsp;At the deep end of the lake is where the steel golem spawns,



usually you'd find a lizard champion as a placeholder. You have to kill the



placeholder so that the golem will have a chance to spawn. &nbsp;Again, running



from here is not easy and the gators are tougher than Lockjaw, do not be fooled



by their size =)</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The Sewers is also deep



in the dungeon. &nbsp;This time you have to dive in the well found up the ladder



at the north of the courtyard. &nbsp;A huge pool full of gators can be found



here and a stairs leading up to the entrance to the sewers. &nbsp;The play the



sewers, you normally setup in the courtyard and your puller (who should be



master in swimming) pulls gators from either the pool or from the sewers.



&nbsp;Lizard heralds, protectors, fanatics, justicators, judicators also spawn



inside the sewers and can make pulling very challenging =) &nbsp;There is



another gator pool at one section of the sewer which leads to the temple, as



mentioned earlier. &nbsp;One section of the sewer leads to the Avatar room,



where the famous Avatar of Fear spawns, which leads me to my next topic -</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 35+ - At level 35,



if you are not yet bored from killing lizards =), there are still spots where



you can get good experience. &nbsp;The sewers and temple can still give good xp



and the Avatar room is a place where most high levels hang out for a chance to



kill the Avatar and Cenobite.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There are several ways



to get to the Avatar room, there is a door just outside the throne room area



that leads to an underground pass, and also a door at the north wall of the



courtyard that leads to an open area which is full of lizards of all levels. The



way I usually take is through the sewers, at the branch, the left plank leads to



the Avatar room, and the right plank leads to the gator pool. &nbsp;The Avatar



of Fear and the Cazic Cenobite spawns right underneath the big &quot;green



bubble&quot;. &nbsp;Usually a lizard champion as placeholder will spawn and you



must kill it to allow the rares to pop.</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I think that's it.



Obviously this is not what all you need to know about Cazic-Thule Temple, but I



leave that for you to discover. &nbsp;Cazic-Thule is an awesome place to hunt, a



very dangerous and exciting place. &nbsp;This is one dungeon where most



friendships are formed and most reputations are destroyed, for players who do



not cooperate or do not learn to share (i.e. kill-steals) or worse, causing a



lot of deadly trains, will find themselves short of friends when they need to



find a group to hunt in the next higher level dungeons like Nagafen's Lair and



Lower Guk. &nbsp;Being a team player and being a helpful adventurer goes a long



way in the world of Norrath. &nbsp;</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So with this advice, I



bid you good luck!</font>



<p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">May your swords ever be



swift, and your magic never fail.</font>
