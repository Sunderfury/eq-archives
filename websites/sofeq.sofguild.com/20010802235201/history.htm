(SoF) guild was founded on 1 October 1993 from the remnants of the DarkNation guild by King Turk, Queen



Tamlyn, and Prince Duplicator in the Evil Way host on the Shadows of Yserbius RPG on what was at that time called the Sierra Network



(TSN).</FONT></B></P>



<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Trebuchet MS,Arial,Helvetica">King Turk had a dream that SoF would eventually have a chapter in every RPG Host on



TSN. By the time The Fates of Twinion (the second RPG in a series of three) was released, SoF had grown to 30 or so members. Prince Duplicator was made High Prince of Twinion shortly after its release in October 1993. A number of SoF members (including High Prince Yuglooc) decided to join Duplicator in Twinion Pub - SoF's first home in



Twinion. King Turk's desire to see a SoF chapter in every host on what had by then become The Imagination Network (INN) caused a rapid expansion in membership in late 1993 and early 1994. On 12 January 1994, Yuglooc was made Prince of SoF's second host in Twinion - which was moved to Dagger Alley the next day when INN made the first of a number of host deletions.</P>



<P>By May 1994, SoF was in nearly every host in Yserbius and Twinion. In late May 1994, two events occurred that would forever change SoF 1. King Turk and Queen Tamlyn split up... both resigned from SoF. They were succeeded by King Bosk and Queen



Iret. 2. Partially as a result of this, High Prince Duplicator decided that the Twinion Soldiers of Fortune would be better off forming their own guild - free from the influence (corruption?) of the Yserbius



SoFs. He decided to call the guild Twinion Dwellers United (TDU). Of the five SoF chapters in Twinion at the time, two joined Duplicator in



TDU; one disbanded, and two - Yuglooc's Dagger Alley chapter and Sir Jorge's Raptor Reach chapter (which moved to Wraith Ravine once INN eliminated that host) decided to remain in SoF.</FONT></td>

<P align="left"><I>I was a friend with some of the original members of SOF, including Prince Paladin, of Lance Lair, and Prince DarkUncle of Fear Forest. I knew them when SOF was formed, but I did not join until February of 1994. At that time, my home was in Lance Lair. When Prince Paladin left due to illness, I was a Duchess, and Prince Paladin's on-line sister. Prince Josh became the next Prince of Lance Lair. When he resigned, the High Council appointed me Princess of Lance Lair. When I married Benedict, King Bosk and Queen Iret attended the ceremony, and during it, formally adopted me as their daughter. (A surprise and an honor I had not expected). When Iret and Bosk left SOF, the high council met again. At this time, I was chosen to be Queen of SOF.</I></FONT>

20 chapters in Yserbius and Twinion. The collapse of SoF began in November 1993 - long before that peak was reached in the spring of 1994. INN announced at that time that their rates would be roughly tripled to $2/hr - and that the &quot;unlimited&quot; plan (which then cost $130/month) would be eliminated. Current members would be allowed to play at the old rates through calendar 1994. By year-end 1994, INN had probably lost 75% of its members - a number of whom had decided to go to the Internet. Although the card games continued to thrive on INN, the RPGers left en masse. Hosts that were once nearly impossible to get into were now no more than half full even at peak times.</P>



<P>Sierra sold INN to AT&amp;T sometime in 1994. AT&amp;T did little to improve things; they maintained the $2/hr rates despite the increasing competition from the Internet. AT&amp;T eventually sold INN to America Online (AOL) in early 1996. AOL - noticing that INN was losing an estimated $20,000 A DAY - decided to fold the network. During the Labor Day weekend of 1996, INN ceased to exist - a victim of competition from the Internet and mismanagement from within.</FONT></td>

<P>Those who were limping along with 286s and 386s, as well as those who did not have Internet access, were lost forever. Those that made their way to the Internet discovered developing RPGs such as The Realm, Meridian 59,



Empiriana, Illusia and Ultima Online. The Realm eventually became SoF's new home - We are currently about 100 members strong and growing every day. but you can still find SoFs in nearly every on-line RPG!</P>



<P>Despite the vastly different atmosphere on the Internet as opposed to INN, SoF has managed to survive and indeed thrive! We are confident that SoF will live on into the 21<SUP>st</SUP>&nbsp; Century - and expand even further into other Internet-based



RPGs.</P>

April 1999, the new online RPG known as EverQuest was released. Many members of



SoF felt that this was a time to expand to this new world and face new challenges. We submitted our charter and guild name to the GMs on EverQuest in



April. On May 18, 1999, SoF was officially recognized as a guild on EverQuest.



This was a great achievement for us as being officially recognized, we were able



to pull closer together with our own private guild chat channel in-game. Many



members were found and brought into the guild by means of a &quot;halo&quot;, an



identifying &quot;The Soldiers of Fortune&quot; text message next to each



member's name. Since that time, we have gathered those wayward Soldiers in and



gone out and increased our ranks quickly. SoF has become a well known force in



the lands of Norrath! Our membership will soon exceed 100 and we are rapidly



growing there.</P>
