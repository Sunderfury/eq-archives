<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">How do you get to 20?&nbsp; The Oasis of Marr is an extremely good zone to get those few levels from 12 to 20.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some tips to make your hunting here easier..... </P>







<P>low level mobs - aqua goblins, caimen, crocodiles, desert madmen estimated level 10-14 </P>







<P>mid level mobs - ghouls, dry bone skeletones, an orc warrior, an orc priest, estimated level 14-17 </P>







<P>high level mobs - a orc warrior (bad grammar = bad mob), deepwater caimen, deepwater crocodiles - level 18-22 mobs </P>







<P>Things to avoid - Sand Giants!!!&nbsp; Spectres!!! and Lockjaw (level 25 giant crocodile) </P>







<P>Where to hunt - There are 3 or 4 good spots to hunt depending on your level.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>At 10-14, there is an NPC camp in the center of the zone by the lake.&nbsp; This is where you can fight aqua goblins, caimens and crocodiles.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stay behind the campfire at all times to avoid wandering sand giants.&nbsp; The aqua goblin camp is underwater hehehe, so your lurer should be at least 55 in swimming to survive =)&nbsp; The camp has around 4 to 5 goblins and they will usually all come after ya.&nbsp; Kill any aqua goblin shaman first and BE CAREFUL when targetting them because you might inadvertently target one of the human NPCs in the camp and well... either you take a faction hit by killing them or zone quickly =)&nbsp; They are low level NPCs (around 10), so they're not that dangerous.&nbsp; Oh and DO NOT USE Area Effect&nbsp; spells as they will also damage the NPCs around you and they will retaliate.&nbsp; Around the camp are wandering caimen and crocodiles, these are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good xp mobs but poor loot.&nbsp; Aqua goblins carry bows and arrows, and the occassional bronze weapon and raw-hide armor. </P>







<P>At level 15 to 18, the best spot is the NW corner of the zone.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where you fight orcs.&nbsp; Remember, AN orcs are levels 15 to 17 and A orcs&nbsp; are level 20.&nbsp; So take note of it =)&nbsp; There is also a 4-orc camp at the SE corner of the zone, this is a good hunting spot and also close to a zone (South Ro). </P>







<P>At level 18 to 22, the best spot is along the shore between the first and second pillars.&nbsp; You can hunt deepwater caimen and deepwater crocodiles here.&nbsp; They are easy kills if you have a good group because they usually fight alone and others won't join in the fun. </P>







<P>Special Notes: Sand Giants now wade in the water so the pillars aren't a safe place to rest anymore.&nbsp; Lockjaw used to be a threat but now, plenty of people kill that kill him for the lockjaw tunic (magic leather armor) and the much sought after Glowing Crook Staff (humongous 2HB weapon,&nbsp; except when wielded by dwarves, halflings and gnomes hehehe)&nbsp; Spectres can be found in a tower at the center of the lake in the center of the zone.&nbsp; They don't wander unless someone is foolish enough to attack them.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are level 35+ I believe. </P>







<P>Oasis of Marr is a good place to hunt.&nbsp; Some say it's a poor loot zone because you just hunt crocs, which is not true.&nbsp; I made about 200plat in this zone to purchase my banded armor.&nbsp; Orcs carry good loot and you also get the occassional jewels from desert madmen too =) </P>







<P>How to you get here you ask?&nbsp; From Freeport go to the South Gate and go south and zone into North Ro.&nbsp; Go east to the beach and follow the&nbsp; shoreline going south or alternatively, from the East Commonlands/North Ro tunnel, go south along the mountainside and the zone border is just after the 3-Dervish Cutthroat camp. </P>







<P>Safe journeys to all, </P>
