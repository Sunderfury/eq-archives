<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">For those of you who have yet to attempt to travel between the continents of Norrath, let me tell you my adventures one night. </P>







<P>Zackary and I agreed to undertake the journey from Freeport to the lands of Faydwer, in an effort to join up with Kellen and go through more adventures together. We were waiting at the East&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freeport docks for the next boat, and happened to be asked to group with a couple of other &quot;more experienced&quot; folks while waiting for our ride.</P>







<P>It turned out that we had a good mix of races in that group. I learned something new today, hehe. If you &quot;spam&quot; group talk with a Norrathian language (Elven, Dwarvish, etc.), the rest of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; group &quot;learns&quot; and improves language proficiency on those that are being spoken. So we sat there, spamming each other and watching our skills grow (good to do while passing time, hehe).</P>







<P>After a few minutes of wait, the boat shows up. We all boarded (btw, in East Freeport, to board the boat, you have to run up to it, and jump, otherwise, you will go *splat* and end up in the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water, LOL). The boat leaves from Freeport, and after a couple of minutes, we zoned to the Ocean of Tears. Zackary got booted out of the world (ISP drop, or just bad packet loss), and found&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; himself in the middle of the ocean when he came back.&nbsp; Fortunately, he was able to spot Freeport after swimming&nbsp; desperately for a little bit, and made it back to shore safely.</P>







<P>Shortly after Zackary got dropped, I found myself on some Island with a couple of my fellow travellers. There is a *bug* in the boat that sometimes &quot;dumps&quot; you at random locations as the boat goes through zones. After frantic /t's to Aileron and Zackary, I heard from OOC that the boat was due shortly back at that first stop where I got dumped. </P>







<P>Needless to say, I boarded the boat for a 2nd time, hoping to make it all the way to Butcher Block, this time around. I resolved to sit still and do nothing to jinx my 2nd attempt,&nbsp; hehe. The boat zoned for a second time, and to my horror, I found myself disconnected from the server!</P>







<P>After several tries, I make it back, and find myself sinking to the bottom of the ocean, no clue as to where I was or how far the surface was, air time getting dangerously low. Now, at level 6,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remember that I haven't even attempted to learn swimming, just yet, so skill is ZERO!</P>







<P>With a quick prayer to the order of The Six Hammers, I started swimming upwards, hoping to break to the surface before the air in my lungs fails me. Just as my air run out, I actually see the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surface way above me, and in a burst of adrenaline, clinging to dear life, I break it out to the surface just as my health bar dropped close to knocking me unconscious!</P>







<P>Wow, the gods were still in my favor to make it this far! I started swimming in one direction, not really knowing where I was, or if the boat was even within reach. Sense heading let me know I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was in a SouthEasterly direction. For the 2nd stroke of luck, I found that the group I was with, was still going through the spams, briefly stopped at this point as they came to realize my health bar came REAL CLOSE to death! Farain, a level 18 Wizard, started talking me through it. He said there should be an island SouthWest of where I was and to swim for it. Because I knew my direction and did not randomly swim about (but stayed in that same direction), it was a fairly easy task for me to re-orient my direction towards where Farain told me to go.</P>







<P>At this point,&nbsp; I noticed my stamina started to go dangerously low. Which meant that my swimming is slowing down, and I feared that I will drown in a sea of tears, with a group trying to coach&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me on to make for landfall that is nowhere in sight.</P>







<P>As you can tell, a series of fortunate coincidences seem to have blessed this struggling monk, and I make it to some kind of rock with about 1 bub of stamina left. I rest up and talk to the group,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; asking what I could do next. One suggestion was to make for a certain LOC, where a dock was and wait for the next boat. Then the group I was with started arguing on whether I will be even able to make it, since my swimming skill was virtually nothing (went from 0 to 6, hehe). Farain, bless his kindness, then suggested I send a message to Palladius, apparently the head GM in our server.</P>







<P>My initial message was returned with a &quot;use the /petition unless it is a life or death situation&quot;. I then replied with &quot;got dumped from boat, stuck on some rock island, dont know where to go (&quot;. </P>







<P>The whole time, the group I was with was giving me encouragement, and for the most part, made me realize that even though I was alone in the middle of nowhere, I was not by myself. After a few moments, I noticed I started zoning (while I was standing still), and found myself back in the docks of the first boat stop from Freeport. A yellow message on my screen appeared saying, &quot;You have been summoned by the gods!&quot;</P>







<P>I tell Zackary my good fortune, and quickly log out, resolving to try again, when my heart stops beating like a bomb about to go off! Hehe. </P>







<P>I profusely thank Farain for all his help, pointing out that had he not been there, I was surely doomed to die. Oh, btw, that is the reason why you should NEVER have anything on you that you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can't afford not losing while taking the boat!</P>







<P>That night´s adventure certainly taught me a lot of things I didn't&nbsp; know yet. I hope, in reading this, you have learned as well!</P>







<P>May the gods look kindly upon you all, in all your travels across the land!</P>
