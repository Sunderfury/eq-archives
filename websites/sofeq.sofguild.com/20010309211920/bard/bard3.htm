      the world's core, the Rock Children rose<br>
      Shielded from wurms eyes by dirt and stone<br>
      With gnarled hands and broken bones,<br>
      They carved their place into Veeshan's Home.<br>
      Soon after, the woodlands and deserts and swamps,<br>
      All nurtured life planted, by interloping Gods<br>
      Veeshan left her children, in peaks carved by her claws,<br>
      Turned her back on Norrath, and her fellow Gods laws.<br>
      The Crystalline Dragon content in her lair,<br>
      Sealed off the Sky and still slumbers there.<br>
      Some dragons went mad, apart from their queen.<br>
      Others took charge and formed a wurm Ring.<br>
      The rebels were hunted and sent from the peaks,<br>
      To dwell in the lands inhabited by the weak<br>
      One of these rebels, a lady white as snow,<br>
      Swept up a shard of a nature unknown.<br>
      As years dragged on one by one the wurms fell'<br>
      Into the deep slumber from what no one could tell,<br>
      Their magic had faded, because of the shard?<br>
      Or perhaps from the magic they call Veeshans Veil.<br>
      Now a new verse to this legend I'll share,<br>
      In regards to the Sky and what is happening there,<br>
      Veeshan still slumbers, the veil has worn thin<br>
      The Wurm Queen neglect wakes her children again<br>
      Ah, my friends, the song is done, but I will warn you to heed the words of
      my verse<br>
      For they speak the truth. Mortals now visit where Veeshan slumbers and<br>
      Only dragons once dwelled, but the door to the Sky is not one way portal.<br>
      There is much to learn from the Great Wurms, and much to fear.<br>
      The song is finished my friends, I hope you take heed even tho my voice is
      not as sweet as Lady Sainy's</span></font>
