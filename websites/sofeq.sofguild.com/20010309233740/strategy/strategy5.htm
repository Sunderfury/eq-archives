If you are not a &quot;powergamer&quot; or on &quot;Levelquest&quot;&nbsp; don't waste your hard-earned plat on a full suit of Banded armor.&nbsp; (note: I'm not saying don't buy banded, just don't buy a full suit =P) </P>







<P>You ask why? Buying banded is the fastest way to get the best armor available (to those who can wear em) from level 10 onwards and it's good up to 30.&nbsp; But if you are playing the game on your own pace, the best way is to obtain armor and weapons on your own by looting it from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monsters.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>Of course at least a complete leather suit is a must so you don't get clobbered too much, and maybe the higher AC banded pieces like tunic and leggings.&nbsp; As your levels go up, your AC rating goes up, and if you are usually with a good big group, you don't need that much armor.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>Go to SplitPaw, Runnyeye and Befallen to get magical leather and chainmail pieces off critters.&nbsp; At level 20+ go to Unrest/Najena to replace those&nbsp; chainmail with bronze plate.&nbsp; Sell and trade to get a complete suit.&nbsp; Of course it takes time, but like I said, do this only if you are not on a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerquest to get level 50 in the least time possible. </P>







<P>In the end, you will replace those banded armor pieces anyhows, so why buy them at all?&nbsp; The money you earn can also be used to purchase neat magical items like rings, earrings, cloaks, necklaces, which will improve your statistics greatly.</P>







<P>Many a times, a magical armor piece will be sold for only about 10 to 15p higher than the banded piece I purchased. </P>







<P>What's the point of this message?&nbsp; The point is, for those who are aiming to make 150pp to buy a full banded suit..stop hunting the same critters over and over that only give you cash loot, and start exploring the dungeons that give those magic armor, weapons, items that you'd want in the end.&nbsp; It's more fun even!! </P>
