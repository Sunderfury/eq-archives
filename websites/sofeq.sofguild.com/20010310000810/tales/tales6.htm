        **OOC:
        Hiyaz everyone Pipp here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
        is a story that I have been developing for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Its about Bucher Blokk an Ogre Shadow Knight that I play on
        Mithanial Marr server. I hope yall enjoy it &lt;Grin&gt;**<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Bucher
        stirred from his slumber; he stretched and several satisfying cracks sounded throughout his body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Reaching
        for his axe, Bucher smiled evilly as he scanned the area for his first
        victim of the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">It’s
        hard being a runt; my smallest sister is at least two feet taller than
        me and out weights me by three hundred pounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>All the other runts I’ve known, of which there have been few,
        didn’t last their first five years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>They were killed and eaten by their own families.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“Humph!”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess
        that goes to show that I’m smarter than the average ogre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I learned early to hide and hide well when my littermates were
        around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On those occasions
        when I wasn’t fast enough I ended up being the ball that got kicked
        around, or, more often, the “Dwarf” that got beet within an inch of
        his life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Luckily I was
        good at hiding, or perhaps, it was the fact that I feared the Lizard Men
        that lived in the forest less than I feared my siblings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>At least with the lizards I knew that my death would be quick.
        They would chop off my head, put it on the end of a stick as a warning
        to others, and throw my body in a pot of boiling water to be had for
        tomorrow’s lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
        brothers and sisters on the other hand would leave my head intact so
        that my screams would be a warning to others.</font></p>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">That’s
        all in the past now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now
        I’m a Greenblood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>True,
        I’m only a peon now; but that will change soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I have every intention of earning the rank of Squire Apprentice
        within the fortnight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
        is why I spend most of my days here in the Feerott killing Lizard Men
        for Soonog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only does
        this give me the weapons experience that I need to survive; but it also
        raises my standings within the guild.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“Humph!” Guild Leader Soonog isn’t nothing but a fat, lazy
        slob that has all the peons kill lizards and bring the meat to him so he
        can get even fatter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
        take all the risks and he reaps all the benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Grevak isn't much better, but at least he only wants the
        lizards’ tails; and he gives me a spell scroll for my trouble.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“Grevak.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He is
        a mean one though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
        doesn’t think that the Greenbloods’ need any more new recruits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He thinks that the only Shadow Knight that will ever be needed is
        Grevak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>True, he is strong
        and powerful, but even he can be killed, of this I am sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Of all the knights in the guild Bonlarg, Soonog’s second in
        command, is the only one I trust.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He is the only one who has actually tried to help me with my
        training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I think that this
        may be because he knows that our ranks are getting weak.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps he is aware of something that none of the others know
        about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He has offered me
        the Shadow Tunic if I bring him three lizard fifes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The tunic may not be much, but at least with it I will be
        recognized as more than just a peon, I think too that this quest is more
        a test to see if I am worthy of his training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        story here I will fill it in later (hopefully)***&nbsp;<o:p>

        </font></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">I
        hate the desert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
        nothing like my home, the Feerott forest. I would rather be there right
        now.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The forest has huge trees as big around as five ogres are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The scraggly things that grow here in the Desert of Ro could
        barely be called shrubs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
        rains a lot in the Feerott, which, combined with decades of fallen
        leaves, gives the forest the sweet smell of decaying vegetation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There is no smell at all here, just the burning heat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“Humph! Rain, I have not seen that in weeks.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The brightness of Ro is almost too much for me to stand; it is
        blinding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is always a
        fog drifting through the Feerott.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
        gives the forest a haunted feeling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>I suppose that is why there are so few travelers there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Then again, it could be because of the multitude of ogres and
        trolls that inhabit the area that keeps them away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Here it definitely has to be the heat, no one in his or her right
        mind would even think about living here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Bucher laughs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        guess that is why the only thing that I have seen living here are mad
        humans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a river
        that splits the Feerott in half.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oh
        what I would not do for a swim in its cool waters right now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>There are fish in the river, mostly piranha, I should know, they
        are what I have lived on for most of my life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Having lost most of the fights at the dinner table to my
        siblings, I had to learn how to fish in order to survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Desert of Ro, on the other hand, has no ready source of water
        or food, so a person could starve to death quickly here, if the heat
        doesn’t kill him first.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        heat of Ro is near unbearable unlike the cool soothing dampness of the
        Feerott.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
        here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing here but
        sands as far as the eye can see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        desert, in my opinion, is dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        Feerott, on the other hand, is teaming with life, a life that I hope to
        see again soon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">I
        have earned a lot of respect over the last few months, Bucher thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Only a few months ago I was just a peon—now I am feared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Per haps it is me the others fear, or perhaps it is The Reaper of
        the Dead that is the source of their fear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Bucher caressed the giant Scythe affectionately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The handle is twelve feet long and the three-foot curved serrated
        blade is razor sharp,.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        whole assembly glows with an evil bluish green aura of magic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Reaper is an ancient artifact that was once carried by the
        leader of a rival shadow knight guild.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The fight in which I killed him was where I earned most of the
        respect of my masters.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They thought that no one of my level of training would be
        able to kill him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I guess
        my masters were wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Soonog
        keeps a watchful eye on me now; perhaps he thinks I want to be guild
        leader.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>My prize for killing the enemy leader, and subsequently
        allowing the Greenbloods to wipe out the entire opposing guild, was The
        Reaper.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I advanced through
        the ranks quickly after that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
        Grevak, the guild bully, now gives me the respect hat I have earned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Few ever master the skills required to wield the scythe as a
        weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had to search for
        weeks to find an instructor that would teach me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Most consider the scythe to be too big and bulky, too slow for
        combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not I, I have
        trained hard and long to master the skills necessary and now The Reaper
        and I are a force to be reckoned with.</font></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Soonog
        has sent me on another “training mission.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He told me that this task is to improve my ability to fight under
        harsh conditions. So, he sent me to the Desert of Ro.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I think Soonog just wants me as far away from him as he can
        get me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My mission is to
        destroy a band of dervishes that are operating out of the desert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Apparently they are making raids into the Feerott and further
        into Oggok, my home, killing ogres for sport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>“Humph!” I suppose I should stop reminiscing and get on with
        it.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Bucher
        approached the top of the sand dune with caution.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The dervishes were on the other side; he could smell them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Peering over the top of the dune, Bucher saw three of the rogues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>One was an outer guard and two were sitting by the campfire
        talking while roasting a lizard; a tent was sitting in the background.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Bucher lowered himself back down the dune.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>While waiting for nightfall, Bucher began preparing the spell
        components that he would need for the coming battle and checking his
        armour one final time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
        will be easy, he thought.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2" face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">As night fell,
        Bucher climbed back to the top of the sand dune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He began casting a Clinging Darkness spell at the outer guard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>As soon as he was hit the guard sounded the alarm and charged
        Bucher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the dervish
        approached, Bucher hit him with his next spell, Disease Cloud.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>By the time Bucher finished casting the rogue had reached
        him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ducking a wild swing,
        Bucher cleaved him in two with one mighty swing as the other two
        dervishes approached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
        a swift thrusting motion, Bucher back the fastest of the remaining men
        back down the dune.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        third dervish started maneuvering to the right; he was trying to get
        behind Bucher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sweeping The
        Reaper in a wide arch, Bucher caught him with a glancing blow putting
        the third man out of the fight for a few seconds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Turning back to the fast dervish, Bucher feinted left, spun the
        scythe in his grip and caught him with a back swing, taking off his arm
        and most of the shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        third rogue, having finally regained his footing, charged in under
        Butcher’s guard and slashed his leg.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Bucher roared in pain and anger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Swinging his fist down at an angle, Bucher crushed the last
        dervish’s neck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pausing
        for a moment to catch his breath Bucher began to bandage his wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Then disaster struck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While
        Bucher had been busy with the other three rogues a fourth had come out
        of the tent, a shaman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        shaman had cast some sort of weakening spell on him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He charged the shaman, fighting off the weakness that was
        settling in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pain and anger
        and hatred were boiling up in Bucher to the point of eruption.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>As he ran toward the shaman, Bucher was hit by several more
        spells; he dropped The Reaper and continued on toward the shaman with
        his bare hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As he
        reached his opponent Bucher grabbed him around the throat and forced all
        his hatred, anger, and pain onto the shaman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>This action caused the innate power of a shadow knight, the Touch
        of Death, to come to life in Bucher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The shaman withered and screamed in pain and agony; Bucher’s
        raw hatred was killing the man.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Bucher felt the drain caused by his death touch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>When the shaman ceased to move, Bucher collapsed from the
        multiple wounds caused by the battle and exhaustion.&nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in; line-height: 100%"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica"><font size="2">Several
        hours later, after the magical poisoning had worn off, Bucher awoke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Not so easy after all he thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Limping to the corpses of the dervishes, he began to rummage
        though their pockets and purses to find anything that might prove to his
        masters that he had accomplished his task.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Each of the dervishes had a Cutthroat Insignia ring on, that
        should do the trick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bucher
        also found a note.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From
        what little of the common language he could understand this note was not
        good news for Oggok.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
        suppose I will have to take this to Soonog.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>All of the Greenbloods will need to know about this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And I suppose that the Krakneks, the warriors’ guild, will need
        to know too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This note, if
        it is true, means that all ogres are going to have to unite in order to
        survive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This note means
        that we will be going to war.&nbsp;</font><o:p>
