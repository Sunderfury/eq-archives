<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Greetings fellow adventurers!&nbsp; While it is still fresh in my mind, I've decided to write down some tips, do's and don'ts in the Estate of Unrest, a &quot;dungeon&quot; in Dagnor's Cauldron (south side of Butcherblock Mountains). </P>







<P>As usual, the first step is to get there safely =)&nbsp; Along the way are pretty nasty aqua goblins that roam the area going to the dungeon entrance. These mobs range from level 15 up to 25 I believe, so it is best to avoid them as they like to gang up on you.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>In my opinion, one should only look to venture in Unrest upon reaching level 20.&nbsp; This will save you some trouble with the lower level mobs (rats, undead skeletons) in Dagnor's and also tormented undead, jack o'lanterns and death beetles in Unrest.&nbsp;&nbsp; These mobs give poor loot (well, some of them have bronze weapons but is hardly considered valuable at that level =P).&nbsp; It is not worth the risk of hunting these critters in the area since there are so many high level mobs being trained to the zone border and you would probably end up zoning a lot, or worse, dying. </P>







<P>Getting to Unrest is not that difficult, risky but relatively easy especially if you have Spirit of the Wolf or a Bard's Selo´s Accelerendo spell.&nbsp; Upon entering Dagnor's Cauldron, go straight down the cliff and you will spot an NPC camp.&nbsp; This is a good place to run to in case you run into trouble&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with goblins, but have care as sometimes the NPCs react slowly and would ignore your plight at times.&nbsp; Follow the shore along the base of the cliff going south. Along the way you will see an aqua goblin camp.&nbsp; Avoid this!&nbsp; Stay low and run along the cliff very close to the water.&nbsp; Soon enough you will see the entrance to the dungeon and is a safe enough area as most mobs do not enter that voluntarily and usually there are people resting from that zone that will kill any gobs or skels that may come that way. </P>







<P>Now that you are about the enter the Estate of Unrest, the fun starts......</P>







<P>By the way..forget going to Unrest if you don't have magic spells or a magic weapon.&nbsp; More than half of the mobs there are vulnerable only to those and whacking them with your trusty mino axe will be like piercing a sand giant with a rusty dagger. LOL =P </P>







<P>Okay, so what to expect in Unrest.... </P>







<P>low level mobs - death beetles, tormented undead, death beetles,&nbsp;&nbsp; and greater skeletons.&nbsp; Estimated level range 14-18. </P>







<P>mid level mobs - lurking mummy, ghouls, dry bone skeletons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Estimated level range 18-22 </P>







<P>high level mobs - carrion ghouls, barbed bone skeletons, skeletal monk. Estimated level range 22-26 </P>







<P>higher level mobs - greater dry bone skeleton, werebat, undead barkeep, undead noble, undead knight. Estimated level 25 to 28 </P>







<P>Unique and special critters - Reanimated hand (level 25), Ghoul magi (never saw it so I haven't conned, but I ran as soon as it took off 2 bubbles from me with one spell!! hehe), Mortuary Fungus&nbsp;&nbsp; (level 26-28), the HAG!! (level 28-30).&nbsp; I'd say without a good powerful group of level 25+, forget the special mobs and start thinking about zoning as soon as your hear a shout or a warning that &quot;The hag is out!!&quot; or &quot;Hand to zone!!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; hehehe </P>







<P>So where are these mobs located?&nbsp; The dungeon is called the Estate of Unrest, because it's just that.&nbsp; It is a huge house in the center of the zone. Three levels and a basement (which I have yet to explore).&nbsp; Low level mobs are outside the house, mid levels are found in the first and second&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; floors.&nbsp; The high level mobs are found on the third floor and the basement, and the special ones can spawn anywhere, usually the third floor or&nbsp; basement, but may sometimes surprise you when it spawns in the foyer =) </P>







<P>What to expect in terms of loot?&nbsp; Most carry coins, mid level and high level mobs carry some platinum, but loot I consider good in this area are fine steel weapons and various pieces of small ringmail and bronze armor, but the most sought after items are bloodstained armor (magical chainmail that adds bonuses to dex and str and magic resistance), and other magic items like Ivory Bracelet (+25 mana), Savant's Cap (adds to wisdom and int), Thick Belt (8 AC WT 1), Pugius dagger, and others I can't remember off hand. </P>







<P>Okay, now that you have general knowledge of what's in there, how do you fight?&nbsp; Easy...take your group and storm the basement!!&nbsp;&nbsp; hehehehe just kidding.... =)</P>







<P>People mostly fight outside the house, which is a good idea...because.. 1) it's easier to zone&nbsp; 2) it's easier to zone and 3) it's easier to zone =) </P>







<P>Usual group tactics apply here.&nbsp; One brave (or foolish) volunteer goes inside the house to lure a critter to the courtyard or the backyard (wherever your group is waiting) and others will /assist him/her.&nbsp; Usually more than 1 critter will follow the main target as they spawn so close together and sometimes, one will spawn by near the door entrance and join the mob he/she is dragging along, hence the usual cause of trains. </P>







<P>By now, you should have been using hotkeys that has &quot;/assist&quot;,&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;/shout TRAIN TO ZONE!! GET OUT OF THE WAY!!&quot;,&nbsp; &quot;/g INCOMING!! GET READY&quot;&nbsp; or the like, because things here happen so fast, you'll die if you have to type those commands over and over and fighting multiple mobs is always confusing =) </P>







<P>Expect lots of trains, it is normal.&nbsp; Don't be frustrated if all of a sudden you are fighting more than 3 critters when you just lured just 1.&nbsp; Know the strength of your group, and zone when things become hairy.&nbsp; Even if you think that you'll be able to kill one critter while fighting a group of mobs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but taking a lot of damage in the process, forget it.&nbsp; The time lost in recuperating is not worth the xp you'll get from one mob.&nbsp; Better to zone and regroup. </P>







<P>What else can I say...hmmmmm.. oh the hag can charm!! so be careful when you see the words &quot;The unfestering hag begins to cast a spell&quot;&nbsp; Keep your distance or get ready to zone.&nbsp; Before people became higher levels, this is a dangerous situation if you get charmed since the hag might go back to the house and take you along with her, which I don't think you'll like one bit =)&nbsp; But now people can kill her, so charming ain't that bad hehe except for the embarrassment of attacking the other players in the area, involuntarily.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>







<P>Oh and be careful of GhoulRoot!!&nbsp; This is the number one cause of deaths in Unrest.&nbsp; Can't run = Can't zone.&nbsp; It is best if someone has a Cancel Magic spell or if you have a bard in your group, he/she can negate the effects of GhoulRoot with Selo's Accelerendo (so get a bard in your group as much as you can hehe) </P>







<P>I suppose I have given a lot of information, but there are still lots I haven't mentioned and I will leave them for your discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp; EQ is about adventuring into the unknown and I hope I didn't ruin much of the fun for you =)&nbsp; Dying and doing foolish things in dungeons I'm sure ain't fun so I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hope this will give you some beforehand knowledge of the Estate of Unrest...an awesome, scary, and worthy dungeon to visit =) </P>







<P>Safe journeys to all, </P>
