        stopping only to exchange a word or two with their officers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        Soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Traveling with

        near the unholy sizzle of the firepits at the mouth of the fortress, the
        six Soldiers joined their forces together in a unity, re-cementing their
        bonds of friendship in a group form that allowed them magiks of
        communication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then they
        entered the dank tunnels that would deposit them on the turf of Emperor
        Crush.<o:p>

        gnome and dwarf forms lay there as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Some fortunate souls were standing over their corpses removing
        their possessions and re-donning them; other forms were still unlooted,

        making his rounds, blessing and healing wherever he could.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“Go on if you need to,” he told the party.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        from the far side of the fortress enclosure the party could hear
        screaming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then a small
        group of elves staggered to the tunnel mouth dragging another elf, one
        who seemed to be kicking and struggling.<o:p>

        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“He-help

        </span>“This is my sister! She was captured by the orc centurions near
        the northernmost lift to Kelethin and they’ve drugged her or
        something!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was their
        slave but now she doesn’t want to come with us back to freedom!”<o:p>

        another of the bloodied, panting, exhausted young elves said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“They attacked us.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The orcs make their slaves turn on us when we come to rescue
        them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not just the elves,
        either!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are dwarves
        in there who are so strong we couldn’t subdue them and drag them
        out.”<o:p>

        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Tiffini
        looked at the struggling slave intently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Then with a wave of her hand she hypnotized the girl, who
        thereupon stood still, gazing blankly about.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Maiia appealed to Tunare and then cast a regenerative aura around
        the party and their captive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        goddess’ gift in this case not only helped the raiding party recover
        its strength and health, it seemed to restore sanity to the slave.<o:p>

        your sister off with your family or with the healers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        be back!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And our friend and

        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Thudding
        footsteps made the hangings on the walls flutter, and a group of guards
        charged into the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
        teams went into action, blades flying, supportive and attacking magiks
        making the air sparkle with their powerss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Letrea sent arrows into the guards when she could, but most of
        her senses were focused on the space behind the throne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>From that space, she knew, Crush and D’Vinn could be expected
        to attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Crush was simply
        a brute like so many of his orcish subjects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Even his shaman and priests, despite their spells, were
        essentially stupid.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">But
        Ambassador D’Vinn… now he was a different story.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He was a sly and deceptive Dark Elf and he was as likely to
        slip his dirk between her ribs before she even saw him as he was to
        stand and fight.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
        two parties were reducing the guard troop to bloodied corpses in rapid
        pace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Balo was keeping
        their injuries in control, with Shakalaka backing him up between
        magiking the enemies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Maiia
        was keeping the fighters covered in magical armors and Prank was
        slipping between the orcs’ legs and backstabbing them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Tiffini managed to keep the unengaged guards mesmerized, and
        Goosewyn placed his magikal fires expertly.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">As
        the last two guards slumped to the floor, Letrea cried out a warning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“The Emperor is alerted, and D’Vinn with him!”<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">As
        one, the two parties converged on the area around the throne.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Salley, being so large, could not seem to fit, but Shakalaka
        waved her staff and suddenly he was just as strong but half his former
        size.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leith and Letrea
        stood on one side of the throne, blocking the path into the room, while
        Zackary and Salley stood on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The magikworkers stood further back, ready to do whatever they
        could.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“There’s
        others with them!” Letrea suddenly warned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“It’s… it’s… oh no!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>It’s the Prophet!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
        will keep them magiked, making our task much harder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>And the Royal Guard as well!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>First, the Prophet, then the Guard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Then when they are done for, take D’Vinn and Crush!”<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Expecting
        at any moment to see the brutish emperor and his inky blue advisor, the
        party tensed and stood alert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet,
        though the rangers Letrea and Leithreas knew through their extended
        senses that the enemy was close, and Maiia’s druidic senses confirmed
        it, no enemy appeared.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Finally
        Letrea said, “I’m going up into the Emperor’s private tower room
        and draw him out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Be ready
        to support me, because I shall be returning hurt, I’m sure.”<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Up
        the ramp Letrea darted, her bow ready, hoping to draw one of the four
        vile opponents down toward her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly
        she was shocked by a bolt of ice particles penetrating even the ivy
        armor she wore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shaken, she
        nonetheless drew back the arrow and let it fly into the Prophet.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
        high shaman roared in pain and anger and charged at her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Letrea backpedaled down the corridor, then turned and ran for the
        throne room, hoping her speed, a gift from Maiia, would get her there
        before he could cast again.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">As
        she rounded the edge of the throne, Salley leaped between her and the
        orc, swinging his giant axe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leithreas
        joined the fray, hitting the Prophet as Tiffini magiked the other three.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Letrea backed away to regather her senses and strength, but was
        stunned by a blow from perhaps the largest orc she had ever seen.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“Move,
        Let,” Tiff cried urgently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Crush
        is on you!”<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
        rest of the team members moved in, while Balo tended to Letrea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The ranger, however, brushed the dwarven healer aside
        impatiently.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“There’s
        still one more to come,” she said urgently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“Watch for D’Vinn!”<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">As
        though her words announced him, the wirey blueskinned Dark Elf slid into
        the space, his dirk in his hand and a haughty sneer on his face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>He appeared to be headed through the throne room to the hallway
        and the outdoors, then wheeled and sank the dirk into Tiffini’s side.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“No!
        Not Tiff!” Letrea screamed when she saw her adopted baby sister fall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Ignoring the Prophet, Crush and her own injuries, Letrea grabbed
        up her reaver and began swinging, her pain and grief lending strength to
        her arms while blinding her to the strategies she had devised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>She engaged D’Vinn with a double swing of the powerful weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>D’Vinn riposted and stabbed at her repeatedly.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Already weakened, Letrea was about to fall when Zackary
        called on his god for power and touched her, laying on his hands to heal
        her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he grabbed up his
        weapon once more and joined her.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Fortunately,
        Leithreas had managed to get the Prophet down to his last few measures
        of health, and Salley was dispatching the Royal Guard, while the
        barbarian twins were controlling the Emperor and slowly defeating him.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Goosewyn was husbanding his magikal resources and placing
        fiery bolts with care, while sending his pet first to help Leith then to
        help Salley.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Meanwhile
        Maiia used her gifts to restore health to the battlers as Balo tended to
        Tiffini, bringing her back from the brink of death.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>She staggered to her feet in time to watch all four of the
        foes fall at once, a quadruple victory for the Soldiers.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">The
        noble Soldiers came together in the center of the throne room, battered,
        bleeding, but triumphant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Using
        their magiks, they sent messages to the younglings in Kelethin and
        Felwithe, and even in Kaladim, to rally together and come rescue the
        slaves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then they began
        healing each other as best they could, pausing to regain the magik
        strength they had expended in the battle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Salley and Boomshaka stood guard, vigilant in case some of the
        guards, who were milling confusedly throughout Crushbone, wandered back
        inside.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Zackary bent
        down and, using the villain’s own dirk, sliced out his black heart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Then the company gathered up the valuables from their foes’
        lifeless forms and put them in a backpack to store in the guild vaults.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Then, weary but righteously satisfied, they headed home, pausing
        only to cast benisons on the younglings dispatching guards and rescuing
        slaves.</font></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Later
        that afternoon, as Letrea sat curled up next her sweet baboo Lhes, just
        back from his battles in Kunark, she reflected on the day’s
        accomplishments.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“You
        know, Sweetie,” she said, “while we won the battle, and gained much
        loot for the guild coffers, they weren’t the biggest victory.”<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“What
        do you think you really won?” Lhes asked her while making sure that
        the last of her wounds were healing.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></span></p>
        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“The
        most important conquest was of ourselves,” Letrea said.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>“We learned that only when we work as a group, following a
        plan, helping each other, and being ready no matter what happens, can we
        really win the day.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        &nbsp;<o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="2">“Soldiers
        of Fortune, we make our own fortunes as we work together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>We’ve grown stronger because we have grown together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Someday soon, we’ll come to Kunark with you, my Sweet, and help
        find and rescue Firiona.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
