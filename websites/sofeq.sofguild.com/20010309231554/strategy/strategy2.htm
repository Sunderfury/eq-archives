<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">I've been playing EQ for almost 2 weeks now and was lucky enough to get in on the final phase of beta. It is quite a challenging game, as many of you already know. </P>







<P>I started my first char as Zackary, a dwarven Paladin. Paladins are an excellent character, although you have to hack and slash until lvl 9, when you get your first clerical spells. I look forward to lvl 9 eagerly. Lately, I seem to be having some troubles staying alive, what with my ISP dropping me, lag deaths, and a&nbsp; really nasty NPC named Dorn.... hehe, it's been quite a challenge.</P>







<P>I just wanted to give you all a few tips on how to hunt in EQ. Most of my information has been gleaned from other players, but some is all my own. This will be short and sweet, as again, being lvl 5, I'm still just

hacking and slashing.... hehe&nbsp; </P>







<P>1. <u> GROUP HUNT!</u>&nbsp; I can't stress this enough! After lvl 3, you'll notice that it is already getting harder to level. Get together with other people that are within 1-2 levels of you. Try to get a good mix of characters. A cleric for healing, a mage for those distance spells, a couple of tanks (warrior types), and I tell you, get a bard in your group! They really help! (My thanks to Raldor for all the kewl hunts) </P>







<P>2. <u> Tagging</u> - Well, what ever you decide to call it, that's what I call it. Basically, once you have your group formed, have one of your stronger members

(preferably someone who is both fast and has lots of hit points), go find a critter that is agreeable to your group. (i.e. you have decided that the 5 of you can handle a giant tarantula that cons red to 2 party members, but yellow to the other 3), that person runs up to the critter and tags it... basically, takes one swing at it to get it's attention, then runs back to the group. (hopefully he or she will inform you that they are incoming with a giant

tarantula on their behind... hehe) The group then proceeds to demolish the spider... it's a very simple concept and many of you have probably already used it. </P>







<P>3. <u> Group fighting</u> - Ok, very important, keep and eye on both yours and your party member's hit points. If you notice someone getting low, tell them to step back for a couple of seconds, so that the critter you are fighting will focus on someone else... once the critter has turned it's attention to another person, they can step back in. </P>







<P>4. <u> Share the wealth</u> - Yeah, I know, you want that fancy new bronze long sword and it costs 5 platinum, but you all know that we have to share.... hehe...&nbsp;

But hey, we are SoF'ers... I recommend that you take turns looting your kills. Have one person in the party keep track of whose turn it is. Another easy way to share the wealth is to turn automatic split on. Any coins found on corpses will be divided automatically amongst the party.

(although this method has been known to not split evenly) </P>







<P>Certainly this is not a full manual or tip guide, just a lil something for you all out there having troubles leveling and killing critters after lvl 3... Let me know if any of this helps! </P>







<P>Happy Hunting all! </P>
