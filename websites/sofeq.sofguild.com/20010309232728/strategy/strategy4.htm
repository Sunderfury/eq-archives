I thought that since I do have much experience in the gnome and High Elf magic experience, I would lend some of it to you</P>







<P>Here is the High Elf Version:</P>







<P>For any high elf, a magic user is a great char, and probably the best in my mind...the hunting grounds for level 1-3or4 is right outside of Felwithe. go out there and hunt bats, wasp drones, and for level 2+ hunt pixies and orc pawns. When a magic user gets level 4, the best strategy is to join up with a cleric, warrior, paladin, or ranger, and head to BB. to get to BB(Butcherblock Mountains)follow the wall to the left going OUT from felwithe. </P>







<P>Close to Felwithe is a zone, that is to Lesser Faydark, I would suggest going there if going there at all at level 8-12. Skip this zone and wait for the next zone. That is BB. In BB, follow the path straight out from the zone and pretty soon you'll start seeing skunks, and large spiders. These are about level 4-6, so you might want to even have a third person in your party (maybe a cleric for healing). But these are good for hunting for magic users. You can hunt these, and when you hit 6 and 7, begin fighting large snakes. they will give you good exps but hit pretty hard, so be cautious. always know where the path is and get used to where the guards are and other places to stay near as you get higher. </P>







<P>DO NOT FIGHT: Goblin Shamans, Goblin Wizards, Fae Drakes, or those little things that look like lizards(forgot their name). At level 8, head back to Felwithe and buy your level 8 spells. </P>







<P>Then you have two choices that I recommend: go to Crushbone or outside crushbone. I would recommend you get bound inside the cave so that when you die you aren't too far away from your corpse. Be careful outside and inside crushbone because there are orcs roaming around that will attack you. Try to find safe spots in some places. To get to the Crushbone entrance, which looks like a cave with fires infront of it, turn the oposite way to BB, turn RIGHT going OUT of felwithe and follow that wall. You'll eventually come out of it. If you decide to hunt INSIDE Crushbone, zone inside. get ready for fighting right after you zone in, and then head out. Be sure to head left across the river, and you can hunt in a little spot near a flag across the river. or you can continue in that direction, going left and then straight and then left again and down a hill. There is pretty hard stuff there, and if you are a wizard, BE SURE to group with a tank. Hunting there you can get pretty good exps. But be careful for trains. The higher level you get, the more you can wander around there. And it will give you good exps till level 16. </P>







<P>BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT AMBASSADOR D´VINN AND EMPEROR CRUSH AND THE ORC WARLORD AND ROYAL GUARDS! They are all around level 16-20 so BE CAREFUL! All of these are around the castle unless brought out by someone. </P>







<P>At level 16, You can head back to BB. Follow the path and when you get to the fork in the path, go straight and eventually you will come up upon another zone. this is a zone into The Cauldron. be careful. there are so real big stuff in there. even at 16. go straight out and follow&nbsp; the water to the right untill you see a long tower sticking up on the hill, go around that area following the water. Then when you'll clear of it, climb the hill and follow straight untill you see another cave looking like area. This is Unrest. again, if you are a wizard you'll want to travel in a group, but if you are a Mage or Enchanter, you have a pet and can have him tank. In Unrest are pretty big things. I don't have too much experience with it accept I know there are a ton of monsters and stay with atleast 1 other person in it. You can hunt in Unrest till about level 20. Then after this. your on you own!</P>







<P>Gnome Version:</P>







<P>For those of you who like Gnomes. I haven't been a Gnome Necro and don't suggest them. They are disliked by almost every single race and any guard accept Dark Elf, Ogre, Troll, and Erudite will kill you. But, If you are a gnome. I suggest following the same path as a high elf. In Steamfont there are not many (fixed) areas of monsters. So you can get attacked by a high level when hunting low thigs. This is true for all zones but are usually caused by Trains. In Steamfont&gt; Mountains, this is not true. to get to Lesser Faydark from Steamfont, go out of Ak'Anon, head left and follow that wall untill you come up on a zone. This is the zone to Lesser Faydark, zone into LF. Then head right and follow that wall. the first zone you come up on will be into Greater Faydark.(I mentioned this zone when heading to BB.) Zone through this and after you get through, head to the right and follow that wall. That will lead you to Felwithe. There you can refer to the High Elf Version, and you can hunt.</P>
