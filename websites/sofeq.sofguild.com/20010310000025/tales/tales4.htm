<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">Welcome to another edition of my ramblings and misadventures, hehe.</P>







<P>As you all may or may not know, getting to level 10 in&nbsp; the area around Freeport puts you in that not so pleasant reality of having to fight the hard-hitting Dervish Cutthroats and Dervish Thugs. Well, Dervs stay in 3 camps in the North Ro area, and generally will leave you alone unless you provoke them. </P>







<P>A couple of things to keep in mind: </P>







<P>(1)&nbsp; Multiple Dervs may or may not be linked, that is, if they are linked, they will all come together and charge at you if you tag one of them; </P>







<P>(2) Best way to prevent linked Dervs from overwhelming your party is to cast some kind of &quot;Lull&quot; spell... This spell is available to most classes that are over level 8, including my most favorite&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class of them all, the bard class, hehe. </P>







<P>(3) For best results, always cast your &quot;Lull&quot; spell on a Derv that is either blue or green to you; remember that a failure to successfully &quot;lull&quot; a monster will immediately result in the monster coming at ya.... very bad sign in this case, since you will be lulling mostly when there are multiple linked Dervs&nbsp; involved, hehe.</P>







<P>As I got to level 12, I realized I realy, really need to go visit the famous city of the Wood Elves, Kelethin, and get my level 8 song, Kelin's Lugubrious Lament. This song has been re-designed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the beta versions, and is now an equivalent to &quot;Lull&quot; spells of the other caster classes.</P>







<P>&nbsp;Knowing that I am a fairly decent fighter at the 12th level, I&nbsp; endeavor to take on the boat trip from Freeport to Butcher Block all alone. I even managed to convince Reanne (at this time a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; level 14 Wood Elf Druid) to come meet me near the port so I can get a bind, just in case something happens and I meet up with an untimely demise, hehe.</P>







<P>All is well as I sailed from Freeport, to the Ocean of Tears, and finally, to the Butcher Block. Little did I know that I was about to get myself into some serious trouble.....</P>







<P>As I disembarked and breathed the fresh air surrounding ButcherBlock Mountains, I take out my trusted drums and started playing my favorite song, Selo's Accelerando. Pretty soon, I see a message saying &quot;Your feet start moving faster&quot; (or something to that effect, hehe) and I bravely walk out of the gates, and followed the path leading towards Kaladim. Reanne said she will meet me at Kaladim and bind me in that city.</P>







<P>Well, at level 12, my skills in singing and playing percussion instruments are all at &quot;Average&quot;, allowing me to reach the impressive gates of Kaladim in very short order. Reanne told me to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; zone straight into the city, as the mystic spell Bind Affinity only works within the boundaries of a city gate (the caster, however, can bind himself/herself to any zone he/she chooses, hehe).</P>







<P>I zone straight inside, stop right in front of the city entrance, and, before I can even say &quot;Greetings, residents and adventurers of Kaladim&quot; (or even the shorter version of &quot;Hi&quot; hehe) the two guards standing by the gates charge at me shouting something about lasphemy and prompty killed me!</P>







<P>Now, this IS NOT the first time this has happened to me, LOL! The first time, I got dumped by the boat bug, and ended up near the Kaladim gates. As I walked towards the gates, the two guards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promptly attacked me and killed me then, too. I had no clue why that happened then, but suspected it might have been because of my god (coz of the blasphemy shouts prior to my death, hehe). </P>







<P>This 2nd time around I am a little perplexed. I got through the dwarven guards at the gate of Butcher Block port, I even got through the dwarven guards outside of the city of Kaladim (main&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gates), but I get slain anyway inside the city's zone. I have no definite answer to this, but was in no mood to try and get back to the same place naked and pray that guards do not attack naked,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hungry, and obviously dim-witted bard, lol!</P>







<P>The whole time I have been talking to friends and was discussing various options I could do to try and get back my stuff. Reanne suggested that I ask someone to loot my body for me. Well, Kellen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; did that for me the last time around, and I didn't really wanna burden someone with all the knick knacks I carried around if I can solve the problems myself.</P>







<P>Wanna know how I got myself out of this dilemma? Hehe....</P>







<P>Check this out! Hehe.... I created a Dwarf Warrior (wanted to be able to carry ALL the stuff I had in there, plus whatever newbies start with) with maxed out strength. After I named this new toon,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I logged back on as Raldor, now a furious, naked bard in the East Freeport docks (stood there a little bit while I was talking to friends trying to figure out what to do, lol), plumes of steam coming out of my nose not unlike an agitated Minotaur looks like (these are the crits that sometimes drop the fabled Mino Axe, found in Steamfont mountains).</P>







<P>As I sat there fuming, I type /CONSENT Gormak (my newbie warrior, now in Kaladim). I promptly log back out and come back in as Gormak. To my eternal delight, newbies spawn right in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where I died, hehe. (I am new to Kaladim and was in no mood to look at maps to figure out where the gate exits are, LOL). </P>







<P>Needless to say, Gormak was able to loot Raldor's corpse, put it away in the Kaladim bank (which I did manage to find a map to figure out where it was, since at this point I have calmed down some, hehe). I brought Gormak to Freeport via the boat off Butcher Block mountains, and, with the help of a VERY DEAR friend, managed to get Raldor all of his stuff back (except for 20 shurikens that for some reason my dwarf decided was apt payment for his courier services).</P>







<P>My thanks to the friends who had a blast laughing about this when this happened, and who helped me along the way figuring this out (Kellen, Reanne, Tianna).</P>







<P>As you all know, I'm not exactly the smartest bard around town, but I DID see that Intelligence was not a primary bard attribute, so I ignored it, LOL! Anyways, hope you found some knowledge and/or entertainment in this not so inspiring tale of derring (DO NOT) do!</P>
