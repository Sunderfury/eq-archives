        sent this email to me and included the screenshots. Apparently this was
        a GM event, possibly in preparation for the new expansion.<br>
        Excellent work Bigazz!<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Here are the screenshots from Sunday.  There were text messages in several zones concerning
        various dragons (Blue, Green, Red) flying overhead and disappearing into the distance.  When I got to
        the Rathe Mountains, the 3 dragons were already there (didn't see a red one)  The blue and green were small like drakes, but the grey was about Griff size, maybe
        a little bigger.  Not much was happening at this point, however when Mayong Mistmoore showed up, he
        blasted the 3 dragons in one shot then started rambling about his long search for the "Children of Scale" was over and he would see to their destruction, as well as everything they had built (I think the Children of Scale are the kunark as well as the dragons).  I
        was just standing there trying to catch all the text when my Charisma buff wears off.
        Apparently, I'm too ugly on my own for Mistmoore cause he blasted me half way
        across the zone.  I was literally airborne for at least 3 seconds, maybe as long as 5.
        Heck, I started typing to tell the guild what was going on, almost had it finished!  My impact caused me over 800 points
        damage and I'm sure it left a good size crater.  By the time I returned to Rathe, a Paladin (Allora, lvl 50) had gotten a "Crystal Shard" (not sure if it was from a GM or off the dead grey) stats as far as I could gather are 1h slash, 13dmg 23 delay paladin only, no drop.  Not sure if there are any effects or Attribute bonuses.   Anyway,
        that's the story, attached are the pics.&quot;<br>
