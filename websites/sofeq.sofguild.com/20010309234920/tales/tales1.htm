I am a human bard, with absolutely no clue on how to play this game called

EverQuest, hehe. My sense of adventure took the best of me however, forcing me to venture into the town of Freeport
with little help and nary a guidance. </P>







<P>I could swear I've been running around in circles for the first hour or so. Wrongfully, I thought that as soon as I can get my bearing, I'll find my way soon enough. Wrong! After about an hour of seeing the same places over and over again, I grudgingly took the EQ manual and turned the pages over to the city maps supplied in the back (that will teach me not to look at maps, hehe).</P>







<P>Well, after spending a few minutes walking around between West Freeport and North Freeport, I finally find the place I needed to be ---- the Chords of Dissonance. I hand over my guild note to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the kind GuildMaster, get my tunic, and spend my first 5 practice points on my one skill, 1 handed slashing.</P>







<P>A fellow newbie bard was walking around asking, &quot;how do I learn songs?&quot; Well, I shouted back, if you figure it out, can you /tell me? Hehe... Nothing like being in a game you don't know what to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do next....</P>







<P>As I was heading out of the city, I noticed some kind of spellcaster walking around casting &quot;courage&quot; on everyone he sees. Shamelessly, I walked in front of him and asked for a &quot;shield&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spell (as you can see, I had no clue what it was he was casting, only that I wanted it, LOL). He was kind enough to cast his spell on me, and, after thanking him profusely, I bravely walked out of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the city gates.</P>







<P>Off I go to venturing out in the cities to try out how combat looks like in this game. Right outside Freeport, I immediately see a bunch of rats, snakes and spiders walking about. Newbies aplenty too, but there were enough monsters to get by. I right click on the three types of monsters, and found that only the spiders are showing as a &quot;gamble&quot;. I proceeded to go whack at a couple of rats, to see how that goes. It actually went pretty well! For a bard, I didn't think I could damage as well as I did, but I quickly dispatched about 6 or 7 rats in very short order. I guess that spell I had on me proved a lot more helpful than I thought! </P>







<P>Soon, I find myself running out of inventory room and headed back to town to sell to an NPC my (surely!) bountiful loot. Guess what? I netted about 1 gold and a couple of silver, plus 1 level after about 4 hours in the game. Shoot, I made more gold sitting on my hiney making wristbands on Realm!&nbsp; No matter, now that I get the hang of it, I proceed to get myself psyched up for a *major* treasure gathering run.</P>







<P>After a couple of trips, I walked back to my guild to spend the additional practice points I've received. To my surprise, the NPC's in the Bard's place actually paid a little more money for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stuff I've been selling to the closest NPC near the town gates! Hmmm, I seem to remember reading about that somewhere, but, no matter, I figured it out, so I'm going to use it to my&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advantage from now on!</P>







<P>Needless to say, the story gets a tad repeatitive at this point. Nothing but a bunch of rat/snake/spider kills, and a quick run to an NPC to sell my loot, to the bank to stash it, and back again. Occasionally, I can see a wolf materialize on the newbie grounds and watch in horror as newbies drop one after another, unable to ward this one wolf, LOL! When that bothersome wolf happened to be near me a couple of times, I practiced my &quot;run to the guards&quot; routine and found myself being quite adept at it after a few tries, hehe.</P>







<P>On one of my trips to the bank, I was so dizzy from all the zigging and the zagging to get there that I absolutely did not want to go through that again. However, I did want to get back and kill more of the&nbsp; easy monsters out there in the newbie killing grounds...</P>







<P>Guess what? Time to find out what it takes to die here, hehe. I heard that when you die, your body resurrects in your &quot;starting point&quot; which is where I wanted to be, in a hurry. So, after making sure all my gold is safely stashed away, I walk up to one of the &quot;Sirs&quot; standing by the bank. I target him and I attack him! LOL!!!</P>







<P>True enough, he kills me in a couple of blows, and I am back in the newbie hunting grounds, being attacked by an Orc Pawn! Who says newbies don't have teleport spells in Everquest? LOL!!!</P>







<P>After about 6 hours of gaming, I made level 3, and had about 11 gold to my name. Time for me to stop, smell the roses, and learn how to play this game! Oh, and do /tell me when you figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how to learn songs, ok?&nbsp; ;p</P>







<P>P.S. Just thought my ramblings can help folks get an idea of what the world of EQ looks like in the eyes of a completely stupid

newbie, like I am! ;p</FONT></td>
