<P><BR><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF" SIZE="-1" FACE="Tahoma,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica">A Guide to the Dark Lands or So you want to be a Dark Elf</P>







<P>Without doubt, being a dark elf is not easy, however the rewards are higher than imaginings can allow.</P>







<P>Many SOF'ers seem to not want to be seen as Evil, or start in a location where there are not fellow guild members to help you. In places such as Freeport and

Qeynos, where the populations are so high and impersonal, I can understand that choice. However, the Dark Lands offer much

excitement, camaraderie, adventure and beauty.</P>







<P>By far the hardest thing when you start is finding your way around Neriak. Some of the lesser races have sniggered that we use pictures as street signs suggesting we cannot read. Well&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is simply

preposterous! The truth of the matter is simply that we have many visitors of the lesser races (those that our Dread Prince have smiled upon), and they are unable to speak our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; language. Also, unless you are a Cleric or Warrior, you will start in Third Gate, which is the deepest zone of our city kissed by darkness. Your dark brothers and sisters tend not to spend too much time in this zone as it is the

furthest from adventure... and often there are only a couple of Dark Elves in this zone. Be patient, explore, and you shall find your guild, in most cases you are much closer than you think!</P>







<P>We Dark Princes and Princesses are somewhat vain, and enjoy receiving complements, and will often give assistance to those of a cultured tongue. For example, &quot;Hail dark prince, surely our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dread Prince has smiled upon you,&quot; is a good place to start. After this, it is hard for a dark elf not to help such a well versed and cultured young adventurer.</P>







<P>Once you know a few of the main landmarks in Third Gate, you will find Commons a piece of cake, as there are signs in Common (look for the Neriak Underground for all your food, selling and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; banking needs). The Foreign Quarter is a zone of mystery and surprise, and should be explored when you have time. Many lesser races find our city dark threatening, but once you have seen the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glowing patterns on our walls and the illusions that hover above the ground, how can one ever leave without returning to this, their treasured home?</P>







<P>With luck you are now standing at the entrance to the forest, after zoning from the Foreign Quarter. Behind you is the

entrance to the Death Star (Neriak). These lands are confusing and trying for the

uninitiated. It is easy to end up hopelessly lost and in heaps of trouble. </P>







<P>Take a /loc now and write it down!!!! </P>







<P>To get to the resurrection spot, stand with your back to the entrance to the Death Star and turn towards your 10.00 o'clock.&nbsp; Go up the hill a little and you will see a fallen log. You will get to know this spot well... trust me. Even if our Dread Prince has breathed dark kisses on your sword or staff, you will return here often. </P>







<P>In front of you there is a small mountain with a rock top. This is a very important land mark. DO NOT GO LEFT!!! This will get you very dead

until you reach at least level 7-8. Go directly over the mountain.... here is newbie land... but don't stop just yet as there is a great communal area just ahead that is safer to base your hunting from. Ok, you have gone over the mountain, and keep going straight till you hit the road... DO NOT CROSS THIS ROAD UNLESS YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THE RESURRECT LOCATION =). </P>







<P>Follow the road to your left, and there you will find&nbsp; another fallen tree, fondly called the newbie log. This is a great place, as you will always find a hunting partner, assistance and a laugh here. </P>







<P>When you need to sit to get your HP or Mana back... come on back to here and have a good old chat to your dark brothers and sisters. This is truly one of the best things about the Dark Lands. No matter what time of the day or night, you will never be alone here. Here ppl will bind your wounds, heal you, find your body, cover your back, and all for free... We are not like those lesser race towns that charge for assistance.&nbsp; To get back to town, stand at the big end of the newbie log, and face 1-2 o'clock and go straight. It is also the height of bad manners to do a runner with a train (no matter how small the critters are) over the newbie log. There is nothing near this log that can kill you alone... but

be careful of critters ganging up on you. Also don't take the wolf pelts till you are about level 3, as having them on your

Elvin person is an invitation to get attacked every few moments.</P>







<P>Neriak and its Dark Lands are a wonder that must be experienced, though be careful

if you are not touched by our Dread Prince (uur god), as you will surely perish.</P>







<P>May our Dread Prince breath his cold blessings on your travels.&nbsp; I wait to see you cloaked in our blessed darkness.</P>
