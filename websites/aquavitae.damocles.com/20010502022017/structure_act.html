<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>A Junior Member (Acolyte, Squire, Apprentice, Guardsman) is promoted to a Ranking Member 
(Templar, Knight, Sage, Sergeant) when they have reached their 20th level. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>There is no way to be promoted beyond this rank at this time. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The Leadership positions at the top of each branch (Champion, Arch Mage and Captain) are 
appointed by the Hierophant (Snydar). The Second in command positions (High Priestess, 
Advocet and Lieutenant) are appointed by the branch Leader.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The top two positions of each of the 4 branches are given the officer tag.</font></p>
<p><img src="solidc04.gif" ALIGN="left" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0" ALT="" width="229" height="286">Each 
of the Ranked Members (Templar, Knight, Sage, 
Sergeant) can take on a single Junior Member (Acolyte, Squire, Apprentice, Guardsman) by 
making a request to the officer of their branch. From that point on they will be responsible for 
their actions and any needs they have.</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>When a Ranked member invites a new guild member, they form a Mentor/Ward relationship. 
Any problems, questions or other assistance the Ward might seek should be directed to the 
Mentor first. Conversely if the Mentor needs to he can ask the Ward to run certain errands for 
him etc. This very rarely happens, but it should be something fun. (example, Baps had Tanladar 
make 20 Bog Juice getting him started on the road to brewing.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3><b>New member guidelines:<br>
<br>
</b>As a general rule we would prefer if AV Members did not use /anon or /roleplay as they both 
hide your class and level. Anonymous players are not interested in helping others and won't ever 
be called on for help from others. I have a personal rule that I think everyone should put some 
thought to. I do not help anonymous people because they will never return the favor due to the 
fact I will never see their class and level. If a druid asks me for a res I ask them why should I res 
them if they will never show up in a who when I am looking for a teleport. There ARE times that 
/anon is appropriate but in general we would 
like you to avoid using it.<br>
<br>
All members MUST send me your class/race/level and primary tradeskill (this can be nothing and 
can always be changed later). Most importantly I need your 
<b>email address</b>. Each time you level, I also need you to send mail to me, 
</font><font face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff size=3><u>snydar@damocles.com</u></font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>, with your new level. This is important, even if I saw you level in 
/guildsay I won't update it unless I get email from you.<br>
<br>
Finally, above all, have fun! If there's something that's preventing you from having fun let me 
know if there's anything we can do.<br>
</font></p>
