<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Captian's Log: Stardate 2134.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Recently we have encountered a weak transmission from an unknown source. The signal is very 
primitave in its technology and far to weak to decode at this time. We are entering the Gamma 
Quadrant in hopes of tracking down the source of this mysterious transmission. Kirk out.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Spock peers into his scope, green light covers the upper part of his face as waves and lines 
scramble across numorous monitors. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Spock- &quot;Captian, it appears as if this signal is coming from a planet in the Sony system. A small 
inhospitible planet full of noxious gasses called Verant X.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;What sort of intelligent life form could live in such a place? Mr. Sulu, set up 
the 
deflector dish array with an ion pulse to help pinpoint the transmission source.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Sulu- &quot;Aye Captian.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Lt. Uhura- &quot;Captian, Im getting a much stonger signal now.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Onscreen.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>the crew is stunned to see a humanoid life form on the screen smiling at them all. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Hiya gang! I am Abashi from Verant X!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;We intercepted your signal. Are you in need of assistance?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;No, silly. The signal you intercepted, as you so quaintly put it, God I just love 
roleplaying, was actually an enhancement to your ship we were patching to you. You didnt really 
need to respond.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;I dont understand...enhancement? What have you done to my ship? Shields up! 
Red alert!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Oh stop..you dont even know if youll like it or not. We just thought that warp speed 
was a little too unbalancing. The Klingons and Romulans dont get to go nearly that fast. Trust me, 
its only a small change to your speed. Maybe 10% to 50%.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Scotty! I want a complete report on all warp drives. I want to know what this 
fiend has done to us!&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Scott- &quot;Aye Captian&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Oh youre not going to start whining now are you? I just hate it when people whine.&quot; 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Spock- &quot;Captian, I am not certian, but it would appear that our forward shields have been 
reduced to almost half their normal power.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;What??? You, you Abashi being, why are you doing this? We came to aid you 
and you attack us?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Oh gee...you are going to whine now arent you. Well, I guess I'll just have to call you 
a 
whiner then. Whiner!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Chekov, arm all photon torpedo bays and fire!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>a moment of scilence... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Chekov?? Where is Mr Chekov? What have you done with him??&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Oh...well we here at Verant decided that you really didnt need him. All he did really 
was shoot your guns, so we felt for the sake of balance that you could live without the extra 
crewman.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Scott- &quot;Captian..I dont believe my eyes. We left dock with a full supply of dilithium crystals, 
and now were down to almost nothing! I dont understand what is going on.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Why are you doing this? Who are you really?!?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;I told you, Im Abashi from Verant X. This is my leader, Brad.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Brad- &quot;Hi..I hope you like the new improved Enterprise!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;No I...hey, whered he go??&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Oh, hes a very busy guy. He doesnt like to mingle with the lesser beings.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Ive had enough of this. Mr Spock, form an away team. Were going down there 
to meet these _things_ face to face!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Spock- &quot;Aye Captian.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>A few minutes later in the transporter room... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Spock- &quot;Fascinating, it would appear that half of our crew has vanished without a trace, and 
the only reasoning for this is the Abashi creatures word &quot;balance&quot;.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;I know Spock...but what does he mean by it? What sort of balance could he 
mean?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Dr McCoy- &quot;Jim, I got here as fast as I could. I had a patient that was only 
half there and I'll be damaned if all of my tools were missing!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Everyone put on your gasmasks...Alright Mr Scott, beam us down.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>A shrill sound spurs the machine into action as Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and three nameless 
redshirts vanish in a sparkling mist... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Upon materializing onto the Verant X surface loud screams are heard... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Three redshirts- &quot;AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHH!!!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;What happened?!?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Spock- &quot;It would appear that they were instantly killed just as they materialized onto the 
surface.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Why? Why are we still alive? I see nothing around us that would have done this 
and left us here.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Dr McCoy- &quot;Theyre dead Jim.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The three survivors look around in astonishment at the unforgiving surroundings. Craggy rocks 
jutt out of the surface of the planet. Various colors of mist and gas swirl around gaping holes. 
Hissing noises and the bubbling of super heated liquids are the only sounds... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>On a very primitave intercom loud speaker, Abashi's voice pierces the men like a rusty nail... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Ok guys, how do you like our newest addition to the planet?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;You just killed three of my men damn you!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Oh dont start whining again please. Just get over it..its no big deal.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;No big deal? Where are you! Come out here and face us!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>..brief silence... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>A sudden whirring noise is heard and McCoys arms vanish from his body, *poof* </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;My God man! What are you doing to us!?!?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Were making it better. We know what were doing, you dont. I wont talk to you 
anymore if you keep insulting me.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Dr McCoy- &quot;Damnit! Im a doctor not a circus freak! How can I operate with no arms? My 
patience will all die!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Well, we took away your arms because you were fixing everyone too easily. BUT...we 
did give you three extra toes to compensate for it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Three extra toes?? How is this supposed to help him or us? Youve 
killed off half my crew, youve left my ship crippled and open to any attack! What sort of beings 
are you??&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;I told you to stop telling us what is best for you...we know all about what is best.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>suddenly Mr Spock starts weeping uncontrollably.... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;What have you done to Spock?!?!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Nothing...we never touched him. I dont know what youre talking about, infact I think 
youre just making it all up so we will give you something for free. Your just a whiner!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Im telling you! Hes a Vulcan, he isnt supposed to cry, laugh, or have any 
emotions damn you!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Oh wait...youre right. We took out his emotions because we thought that not having 
any made him too effective under pressure, so now all Vulcans will have emotions...but they are 
only little ones.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Spock is still weeping like a baby, now curled up on the ground in a fetal position, Dr 
McCoy is running around bumping into walls because shortly after his arms were taken, his eye 
lids were made to only stay open for 2 minutes every 24 hours.... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Damn you!!!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;I dont know what youre getting all upset about really. Its all so things will be better 
from 
now on. Trust us.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;Mr Scott! Beam us up now!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Scott breaks through on the comlink with a scratchy transmission... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Me Scott- &quot;Captian, Im getting an error from the transporter. Its telling me it cannot beam you 
up!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;What??? Ok, Abashi...what have you done now??&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;Oh, did I forget to tell you?..you need a redshirt in your party inorder to beam in or 
out 
of here.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Captian Kirk- &quot;What?? Our men died as soon as they teleported down! How do you expect us 
to get out??&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Abashi- &quot;I know...its quite the challenge isnt it? Heh heh heh.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Mr Spock is still on the ground crying, Dr McCoy has gotten his leg stuck in some sort of crater, 
and Captian Kirk, sweating profusely yells.... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>&quot;DAAAAAAAMMMMMMMNNNNN YOOOOOOOOUUUUUUU!!!!!&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The end? </font></p>
