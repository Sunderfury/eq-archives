<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=4><u>Aqua Vitae Rules and Codes of Conduct:</u></font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3> </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff size=3>Aqua Vitae</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3> believes in freedom for its members. This freedom granted on our members is to 
allow them the choice of only minimal participation in </font><font face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff 
size=3>AV</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>. We want people to join and get what 
they seek from this experience, not for us to gain what we seek from them. This is not a 
dictatorship, it is, and hopefully will forever be, friendship. We encourage active participation, 
involvement, and comments but no member will be alienated for not doing these. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>The officers of </font><font face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff size=3>AV</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3> are here to provide support for our members and to create a more enjoyable 
playing environment for not only our guildmembers but also the rest of the residents of Norrath. 
Please feel free to contact any of them with complaints, issues, problems or compliments whether 
you are a member or not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>All of </font><font face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff size=3>AV</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3> realizes that each individual in this game has their own right to enjoying their time and 
we by no way own a &quot;camp&quot;, a &quot;quest&quot;, or any locations or creatures in Norrath. 
If an </font><font face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff size=3>AV</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3> 
member is denied the right to something of the like listed above then no member will take matters 
into their own hands. We believe the best way to reach others is not by threatening them or 
alienating them but by demonstrating effective cooperation. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>No member will practice deliberate training. Accidents happen however and the guild will not 
suspend a member because of this without investigating the incident(s). Training constitutes 
anything that the trained person believes it is. </font><font face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff size=3>AV</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3> members realize it is within their power as a 
human being to resolve these conflicts with simple reasoning and compromise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>All members understand that their actions and comments will now carry the weight of our guild's 
name as well as their own. They also understand that their actions reflect upon their Mentor who 
are also responsible for their Ward's actions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color=#0000ff size=3>AV</font><font face="Times New Roman" size=3> membership is based on past actions and intentions. Comments about our members are 
welcome, however, they will not be prosecuted unless they contain 
threatening language, profanity, sexually explicit depictions or other extreme abuse. Our guild 
allows and expects individual freedom so the views or ideas of any single member may not 
necessarily reflect the supported views of the guild itself. We work as a group and think as a 
family, we are not a collective. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Removal from the guild will require a unanimous vote from the officers and 
final approval from the guildmaster.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Any type of profanity, demoralization, threatening language, sexually explicit depictions or 
personal attacks will not be tolerated over guild chat. We realize people become frustrated so 
minor infractions, so long as apologized for, can be overlooked but continual disregard for the 
rights of the others can constitute removal or suspension from the guild. Guild chat is here to help 
us communicate not to spread hate propaganda or used as a trading post for the mistreatment of 
others. </font></p>
