<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>As many of us know, kunark is a very difficult place to travel. Both because of the size of the 
zones and the high level mobs that seem to be EVERYWHERE and 99% see invis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>I wanted to make some guidelines for people travelling kunark but I've decided that some of 
these should be guild RULES. Yes, it's that important. </font></p>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman" size=3><b>Avoid travelling alone</b>. These zones make you feel like you're lvl 5 again trying to cross 
North Karana. You WILL get stomped. </font>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman" size=3><b>Use invis</b>. Most mobs see invis but some don't. And it never hurts to try. </font>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman" size=3><b>Sow is a MUST</b>. Both to escape and to cut down the travel time across these huge 
zones. </font>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman" size=3><b>Avoid using the Kunark Gates</b>. The teleport spot is relatively safe, but you can't get 
ANYWHERE without going thru that damn tunnel. The tunnel that leads out of the portal 
area is packed with mobs that have been trained back to the druid circle and wizard 
spires. Just getting thru this tunnel usually requires a well balanced group of 40's. Once 
you pass thru this tunnel, you have the entire dreadlands to cross. This is a huge 
mountainous area filled with Giant sized creatures. Rather nice place to hunt if you can 
keep up with the pace, but terrible to try and travel across. I can not ever recommend 
crossing the dreadlands from the portals to get to the Firiona Vie Outpost. Use of this gate 
should be limited to those who want to stay in the dreadlands for xp, but even then you're 
better off staying near one of the zones. Unfortunately this means taking the boat. Trust 
me, you're better off waiting on the boat than crossing the dreadlands. It takes a lot less 
time and you will spend less time regaining lost xp. </font>
</ol>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>A side note on evac. When you evac, you're done for the night if you have tanks with. They will 
have to wait for the boat to get back, or cross the dreadlands. You might as well take everyone 
to the dreadlands and cross together as a whole group even if the casters are bound in Firiona 
Vie. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Tanks, speak up. Would you rather die where you stand and be res'd in a few 
minutes or be evac'd back to the mainland and spend 30 minutes waiting for a boat? Let your 
group know so they can plan accordingly. Casters can gate themselves out if need be... Just 
make sure you let everyone know which you prefer. They'll probably evac you anyhow but... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size=3>Enjoy Kunark everyone, but be careful, it's been an xp sucking experience for many people, but 
I don't think I can go back to the old lands...</font></p>
