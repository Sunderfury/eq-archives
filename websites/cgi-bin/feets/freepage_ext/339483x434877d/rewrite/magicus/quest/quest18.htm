Going Postal</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a massive quest involving
most of the cities in Norrath. See the full quest description in Ak'Anon and the
reference table at the end of this
document.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020298"></A><BR></DIV>

Lynuga's Gem Collection</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In the Innothule swamp, you talk to
Lynuga, a wandering NPC troll female that can usually be found near the entrance
to Guk. After level 10 or so she will tell you that she collects gems. By the
upper teens, she will tell you about her gem collection and that she wants more.
Ask her what gems and she will tell you that she wants a ruby. You can buy the
ruby at most jewelry stores. In return for the ruby, she gives one of several
items. Ones I know of are the <I>Brutechopper</I> axe, <I>Midnight Mallet</I>
and <I>Ivandyr's Hoop</I>. FYI, giving her chomper's ruby from Rivervale will
not work. The criteria for what you get seems unclear and could just be random.
However, someone with a lot of time and money on their hands stated that she
gave him a hoop every 20th gem, so it may just be that you have to do it a lot
to get the good items. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020299"></A><BR></DIV>

Nork's Severed Arm</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Lork wants you to find his brother
Nork's dismembered body from a fat alligator in Innothule Swamp. Kill the
alligator and recover Nork's severed arm. Take it back to Lork and he will give
you a Broken Stein to take to the ogre trainer Uglan in Neriak. CAUTION - Uglan
will kill shamen or shadowknights on sight. Uglan will then ask you to intercept
a Blue Orc Runner and get a letter off of him and return it to Lork. The letter
details a conspiracy between the Crushbone Orcs and the dark elves against the
ogres. For a reward, Lork will give you an item, sometimes a <I>Crude Stein</I>.
Then, as pay back, Lork wants you to bring him the hearts of Lord Crushbone and
the dark elf ambassador who visits the shaman guild in Oggok. The dark elf
ambassador is named K'ryn and he is located in komarr's caves (the tunnels). If
you enter the tunnels through the bottom right tunnel, contune through the
tunnels until you reach the shaman trainers you should go to the right and there
will be six or so ogres who sell the shaman spells. In that room there is
another tunnel which will bring you to a room with about five different
passages. In one of those passages waits the dark elf ambassador. You need to
kill him and get his heart. (he also often drops a dragoon dagger). For killing
K'ryn, you lose faction with IndigoBrotherhood, but gain with EmeraldWarriors
and SteelWarriors. The Lord Crushbone is the always camped D'Vinn. You need to
kill him as well and get his heart. Once you have both hearts, return them to
Lork and be prepared to receive your big reward from the grateful ogre - Some
rawhide armor! Well at least you should get some dragoon daggers while doing the
quest. Basically, the only reason to do this quest is if you happen to stumble
across these two dragoons and kill them and want to get rid of their hearts.

Spore Guardian</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is also given by
Hulkulk's assistant in the Shadowknight Guild. You have to get the head of the
Spore Guardian. The Spore Guardian spawns in the Innothule swamp, and it's
corpse sometimes has a "Huge Mushroom Head". Giving the mushroom head to the the
correct troll in the SK guild hall will get you a <I>Froglok Skin Mask</I>.
