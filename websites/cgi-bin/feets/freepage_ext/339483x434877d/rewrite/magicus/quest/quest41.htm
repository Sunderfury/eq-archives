Bandit Tongues</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This may not work anymore. In South
Ro along the zone edge at 1100, 1428 is a 1-tent camp populated by a neutral Orc
"Ortallius" and Wizard "Rathmana Allin". Ortallius wants proof that you killed
bandits. Give him a bandit tongue for faction, experience and a reward.

Evil Research</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you are an evil magic using
class, go to South Ro and talk to the female Dark Elf who sells the smithing
stuff. Walk up and 'Hail' her. You may need a good faction to get this quest.
She wants regular lightstones for the books that give combine instructions and a
greater lightstone for the book that actually combines the ingredients. The book
you get for the lightstone is random and seems to be book one far more often
than book two, so bring plenty of lightstones. You get some good xp for doing
this and it increases faction with DarkBargainers, DreadGuardInner and
DreadGuardOuter. I have been told the combine items don't yet work, so this is
more for the xp and faction than anything else.

Ortallius' Cutthroat Rings</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Hailing Ortallius and talking to him
reveals that as a child he was saved from Dervish Cutthroats by Rathmana and he
now offers a bounty for the return of any 3 or 4 Cutthroat Rings (he'll take
either amount. There is a debate on whether it makes a difference in what you
get in return). Give him the rings for a few minor items. Your faction will
increase with Solusek Ro. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020591"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading590"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Rathmana's Travelling Offer</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Rathmana about the
[traveling offer]. If you give him 30 gold, he will allow you to reach into his
scroll bag and take 1 scroll. The scroll you get is random. It is often an
illegible scroll (take to Highkeep). However, sometimes you will get a high
level (level 20 or so) scroll worth quite a bit. It's kind of like rolling craps
at 30 gp a pop. Sometimes you win, but often you just go away poorer for the
experience. Your faction will go up with Solusek Ro. He also tells you that he
has a [business offer], which is really the end of the <I>Bayle List</I> quest
based in Qeynos. He won't elaborate on the offer other than to say give him the
item and 20 gp, so you have to start the quest in Qeynos. </FONT><BR></DIV>
