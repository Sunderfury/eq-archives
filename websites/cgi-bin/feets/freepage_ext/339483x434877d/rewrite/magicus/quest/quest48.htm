Blessed Oil Quest</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Brother Estle, located on
the road just as you enter the plains and he will tell you that he is waiting to
get some blessed oil. Go to the Temple of Life in Qeynos and talk to one of the
priests, who will give you the oil to deliver to the good monk. Take it back to
him for some money, experience, and occasionally the prayer bead quest.

Brother Trintle</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Tell Suuspa Clanim in the Temple of
Life in North Qeynos about Brother Trintle attacking Brother Estle and she is
shocked and expresses the thought that Trintle must have been swayed by the
words of Bertoxxulous. If you kill Brother Trintle in West Karanas you discover
that indeed he is now a follower of Bertoxxulous. He has on him Broken Prayer
beads, which when given to Suuspa will result in some decent faction hits.

<A NAME="Heading705"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Cure for Lempeck Hargrim</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest for the <I>Shining
Star of Light</I>, a 1HB cleric/paladin weapon. The quest starts with Astaed
Wemore, the same cleric in the Temple of Life who gives the blessed oil quest.
Apparantly Lempic Hargrim is sick and needs a special cure. He will tell you to
go to Rivervale and find Kizzie Mintopp, and tell her that "I am from temple of
life". She will then tell you to find some guy called Honeybugger outside in
Misty Thicket and find out how to get honeycombs, because she needs them to make
Honey Jum. Bring her the honeycombs and she makes the Honey Jum for you. You
then need to give it back to the cleric who gave you the quest. He will make the
Jum into a potion for Lempeck Hargrim of West Karana. Take the Potion to
Lempeck, and receive a rusty scyth (Lore item version). Sometimes he goes crazy
and attacks you at this point. I have seen two theories on what makes him attack
you. One theory is that if you don't get the medicine there within a certain
period after you get it it is too late for him and he attacks. The other theory
is that you have to give it to him in the daytime, since lycanthropy is a
nocturnal disease. I would suggest you get sow and do it in the day just to
cover both. Take the scyth back to the Aeston Wemore, and you get the shining
star. Quickest method to complete the quest without all the talking: 1). Give
Kizzie Mintopp 3 honeycombs and 30 gp for the Honey Jum. 2). Take Honey Jum to
Cleric in temple of life (the one who gives the quest) and get Potion in return.
3). Take Potion to Lempeck Hargrim of West Karana and get LORE ITEM RUSTY SCYTH
- NO DROP in return. His house is near the river bank, between the fields. 4).
Take Rusty Scyth back to cleric in temple of life for the shining star of light.
You also receive the following faction changes: Priests of Life, Knights of
Thunder, Guards of Qeynos and Antonius Bayle get better, Blood Sabres gets
worse. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020653"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading706"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Gathering Grain</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to the Hetina Miller on the
Miller farm and ask "what grains do you grow". She will tell you about crops or
grains. Say "I will help dragging the bails of hay" and she will give you the
quest to gather grain bags on the field. These are sacks of hay, which can
sometimes be found laying around the fields, or on the scarecrows that haunt the
fields. You will get some xp, minor money and increased faction with karanas
residents, guards of qeynos, preiests of life, and knights of thunder.

Gindlin's poison</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>An NPC thief, called Gindlin
Toxfodder, will make poison for you. He askes for a Giant Spider's Venom Sac,
20gp, and Crow's Special Brew (available from Crow at Crow's bar in Qeynos).I
have been told you may have to go through a side quest involving Rat the bum who
hangs out under the Qeynos docks to get Crow's Brew. Give him 5g and he gives
you faction hits and a tattered bag, which you can give to Crow and thus get the
brew. Gindlin is located in West Karana at (-2994, -13393) in a shack between a
house and a barn. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020655"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading708"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Hollow Skull</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Completing this quest will get you
the <I>Jeweled Skull</I>. Yiz Pon will ask you to deliver a note to his brother
in Freeeport named Hyrill Pon. Yiz is running from Splitpaw and some beast is
after him. Very soon after you first talk to him a Splitpaw assassin (lvl 16)
will appear. Kill him and you can loot a hollow skull container (two slots) from
the assassin. Apparantly, Yiz stole this skull in Splitpaw, but then he gave it
to assassin to stop hunting him. However, the assassin is still trying to kill
him. Take a note from Yiz to his brother Hyrill Pon in Freeport (West Freeport).
He will tell you that his brother was searching for some powerful skull which
should add great powers to a wizard. You now have to find two ruby eyes for the
skull (two slots), put them into the hollow skull and hit combine. The problem
is finding the ruby eyes. The first eye is found on Lyunga in Innothule Swamp.
Unfortunately, she has to be killed and looted, which means a fight with a level
32'ish spellcaster, as well as (most likely) major faction hits in Grobb. The
eye itself is a 'Large Ruby' that gives a whopping +1 int when worn. The second
eye (which has been confirmed as such with Identify) is called a 'Ruby Pendant'
and loads on a shaman named Kurrpok who spawns in Paw (he is real dangerous
because another NPC named Zixx Nemix spawns right after him who is really high
level - you may want to gate out after getting the pendant) This 'eye' also
gives a +1 int bonus. Put them in the skull and combine and you get yourself a
jewelled skull, which is a pretty nice magic item. ( +5 int, +20 Hp, +20 mana,
-5 Cold protection) </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020656"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading709"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Langseax</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest to obtain the
<I>Langseax</I> or the <I>Langseax of the Wolves</I>. Complete Version: Go to
Renth McLanis in the tavern across from Mac's Kilts. Ask him "What dangerous
matter?". He tells you of a crime. Agree to hunt the murderer. Renth then sends
you to see Dok in Dok's Cigars. Find out all you can about the crime. He tells
you to go see the leader of Clan McMannus. This is the fishing village located
in West Karanas. Speak to the leader. Then speak to Ulrich McMannus and he tells
you Frostbite can track prey if he has a piece of sweaty clothing. Return to Dok
and ask him "Where is the sweaty shirt?". He then tells you he sold it to Tundra
Jack. Find Tundra Jack on the tundra of Everfrost. He will tell you that Iceberg
is using it for a collar and that you can distract Iceberg with his favorite
meal, Lion Delight. Go back to Halas and speak to Teria O' Danos. Do the lion
meat quest (you get coin and faction as well as the Lion Delight). Once you have
Lion Delight, be sure to bury it lower in your container then your normal food
to prevent it being eaten by you. Take the Lion Delight to Iceberg and receive
the shirt (NO DROP, LORE ITEM) and faction adjustment. Now run to the village
and give the shirt to Frostbite. (NOTE: Frostbite will wait for the murderer to
spawn before he takes off. He walks pretty fast so I wouls strongly suggest that
you have Spirit of Wolf on you. It also helps to have a party member along that
can track because I lost sight of Frostbite many times and have had to start
over. Also, Frostbite likes to fight things along the way. Help him out. Be very
careful not to target Frostbite by accident!) Frostbite will lead you right to
the criminal. The murderer will be either Paglan or Basil. Paglan is tougher to
kill and probably in his low to mid 20's, Basil is around level 20. Kill
whomever the dog leads you to, hope he drops a Barbarian head and then return to
Halas with the head. Give the head to Renth for faction, coin, and of course,
the Langseax (if you have Basil's head) or the Langseax of the Wolves (if it is
Paglan's head). I am not sure what triggers which criminal you get or even if
you can just kill both and get both heads, but it seems that you wil normally
get Basil. Short Version: Run to village, and receive the lion meat. Run to
Halas, turn in meat to Teria and get Lion Delight, faction, exp. and coin. Run
to Iceberg, give Lion Delight, receive shirt, faction, exp. Run to Frosbite,
give shirt, gain exp. Kill the criminal. Return head for faction, coin, exp and
Langseax. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020657"></A><BR></DIV>

Lion Meat</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is also a part of the
Langseax quest. If you talk to one of the merchants outside the city before the
lake, you can get a quest to get lion meat from the fishing village. Talk to
Einhorst McMannus in the barbarian fishing villiage in Western Karanas. He will
refer you to a female barbarian nearby to get the meat. You must say to her "I
will deliver the Lion Meat Shipment to Halas". You get some minor coin for this
quest. A good idea is to combine this quest with the note to Einhurst quest
since they both go to the same place.

The Nitrates</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Gerael Woodone has a flask he wants
delivered to Linaya Sowlin in West Karana. Doing so results in some faction and
a few coppers. At this point she also asks for your protection from the [unkempt
druids] and tells you of a [note]. However, an NPC by the name of Draze Slashyn
shows up and immediately threatens Linaya after you deliver the Flask. If you
beat him you get Status, Money, a Rusty Axe and the Note Linaya just mentioned.
Linaya will ask you to take the note back to Gerael in surefall (see the
Assassins Quest). </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020659"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading712"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Note to Einhorst</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>First talk to Jinkus (he is in the
shaman's guild). He asks if you want to contribute to the guild. He tells you to
find Halana and tell her "Jinkus sent me to assist you". She is located in Ye
Majik shop in Halas) She askes you to take a note to Einhorst in the Barbarian
fishing village in West Karana and return with their monthly Karana Clover
shipment. She gives you directions if you dont know the way. To get to the
village go though Black Burrow to Qeynos Hills, follow the mountains to the left
until you hit a path, follow the path to the left, you will zone into West
Karana. In West Karana follow path until it splits turn right and head from the
path towards the horizon, the fishing village is not far. Einhorst is in one of
the buildings. You give him the note and get money, exp, a box of clover to
return to Holana and the following faction: Wolves of the North, Shaman of
Justice, Merchants of Halas and Steel Warriors increase; Rogues of the White
Rose decreases. When you give the box to Holana you get money, exp, a 1st rank
spell and the following faction: Shaman of Justice and Merchants of Halas
increase; Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Tradefolk and Ebon Mask decrease.
This quest can only be performed by lower level characters. A good idea is to
combine this and the lion meat quest since they both go to the same place.

<A NAME="Heading713"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Prayer Beads</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is sometimes given after
completion of the Blessed Oil Quest. Brother Estle will give you the PRAYER
BEADS of Brother Hayle, and ask you to take them to the High Priestess of Rodcet
Nife in Qeynos ASAP. Giving the prayer beads to her will result in some faction
adjustment, some experience, small change, and quest.

<A NAME="Heading714"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Sands of Time</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There are a couple of NPC's who run
from Brother Estle's tree to T2 guard tower and back. The NPC's are Kyle Rinlin,
Habastash Gikn, Quegin Hadden, and Tolony Marle. If you hail them they say they
are running against the sands of time and are tryin to prove that the paladins
from the Temple of Thunder are the fastest. This apparantly does not sit well
with the shadowknights who reside in the tunnels below Qeynos. They want you to
kill the runners and return with the items they carry for a reward.
