The Cigar</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In Halas, there's a cigar shop SE of
the Shaman temple called Dok's Cigars. Talk to Dok inside and he'll mention a
cigar, but he has none in inventory. If you ask him about the cigar, he will
relay a story about attempting to make something he calls cigars, but burning
himself all the time, so he switched to candle making. A few more questions gets
you the quest to go get honeycombs for him to make candles - you get a jar with
6 slots &amp; combine button. In return, he says he'll give you a 'special
candle'. Your reward is xp, plat and the <I>Everburn Candle</I>.

Cindl's Collection</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>At Mac's Kilts, Cindl is looking for
Polar Bear pelts. If you bring her a non-ruined polar bear skin, she will give
you some exps, 1 gold and a piece of large tattered or patchwork armor, or
sometimes even rawhide. For those of you working on that complete set of
patchwork, she sometimes gives the pieces that are not available to tailor.
Faction for Merchants of Halas, Wolves of the North and Shamen of Justice goes
up and Rogues of the White Rose goes down. She is also looking for Wrath Orc
wristbands and says she will give Raw-hide tunic, leggings or leather gloves if
you return 2 such wristbands to her.

Goblin Caster Necklace</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is given to you by Shamus
Felligan (he is outside the Shaman's guild). The activation sentance is "I will
hunt the goblin casters". The Ice Goblin Casters spawn in 1 spot in Everfrost,
and are a very rare spawn. They can be found by following the right side wall
after leaving the 1 guard area. Eventually you will come to 2 igloo's. Casters
and Scouts spawn here. Casters spawn about 1 in 4 times, and drop necklaces
maybe 1 in 10 times, so expect this to take a while. After killing a few casters
you will get either "shattered caster beads", or more rarely, "caster beads". If
you return the shattered caster beads to Shamus and you receive faction with the
guild, exp, some money and a minor item. If you return the caster beads, you
will get a <I>Gavel of Justice</I>.

Going Postal</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a massive quest involving
most of the cities in Norrath. See the full quest description in Ak'Anon and the
reference table at the end of this

Head of Granin O'Gill</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is given to you from
Margyn McCann (she is the Shaman's guildmaster). The activation sentence is "I
am a young shaman". She tells you that she wants Granin O'Gill brought to
justice by bringing her his head. He can be found by the statue area of
Everfrost. Do even try to find him until you are 13th or in a large group. The
Orc Shamans and Orc Mountaineers spawn in the same area and will wipe you out
fast. He hits hard (20 points a pop) and casts spells, but he does not have alot
of hit points. When you return his head to Margyn you get guild faction, exp,
somemoney and a spell. Only characters below level 12 will get this quest, but
anyone can just turn in the head for the reward.

Ice Goblin Necklaces</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Approach the Female Warrior named
Lysbith McNaff in the Pit of Doom and ask her about ice goblins. She wants you
to gather Ice Goblin Necklaces from the Ice Goblins that roam Everfrost. The
activation sentence is "I will protect the pass". If you choose to accept her
quest, she will give you a box with six slots in it for you to use. Collect 6
necklaces, combine them and return to her for a minor item, money and some
experience. Giving necklaces to Lysbith Mcnaff raises your faction with Wolves
of the North; Shamen of Justice; Merchants of Halas and Steelwarriors and it
lowers your faction with Rogues of the White Rose.

Ivan McMannus' Remains</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Renth McLanis in McDaniels Smokes
and Spirits seeks to find the remains of Ivan McMannus. He was supposed to
escort Ivan who is a courier, but he ended up drinking the night away and Ivan
got killed. Now he needs to find Ivan's Remains, but he doesn't know they are
located. If you tell him that you will [search for the courier], he will direct
you to Arnis McLish out in Everfrost who will then direct you to the lady who
knows where the remains are (Megan). Arnis tends to hang out around the ramp
into Black Burrow, but he runs around quite a bit in the area. You may have to
chase him down or wait for him to come back. He will tell you that Snowflake
(her pet wolf) can lead you to Megan if you ask him [where is Megan]? Snowflake
is located by the two guards area on the edge of the tundra. Snowflake will lead
you to Megan who is by the North Tower. If you ask Megan "Where are Ivan's
remains?", she will then tell you her sad story and ask if you [will dive for
remains]. When you tell her that you will, she hands you the special box needed
to complete the quest. The remains are at the bottom of the river and you have
to access them through a hole in the ice. There are at least two holes in the
river; the correct one is near the south side of the river and has a large piece
of white ice jutting out of the frozen river next to the hole. When you dive, as
you descend toward the north you will see a goblin diver. I killed this one and
he only had an ice goblin necklace. The next goblin north of that one had a
barbarian rib in his loot. Fighting the goblins below water is difficult (they
are fast) so I lured them out of the hole in the ice to kill them on the frozen
river surface. The rest of the bones are located on the river floor and look
like small bags. The items you collect are: Barbarian rib, skull, jaw, and
femur. The very first item is almost directly below the hole in the ice (was the
femur for me). The other two items are further to the north along the very
bottom of the river. I suggest returning to the surface to get a fresh air
supply between grabbing each item. The furthest piece is dangerously far from
the hole. A person needs a swimming skill of around 30 to swim straight to the
furthest item and still be able to return to the hole before drowning. Once you
have all four items, you combine them in the box and give them back to Renth
McLanis. He will reward you with experience, some money, and a minor item.

The Langseax</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest to obtain the
<I>Langseax</I> or the <I>Langseax of the Wolves</I>. Complete Version: Go to
Renth McLanis in the tavern across from Mac's Kilts. Ask him "What dangerous
matter?". He tells you of a crime. Agree to hunt the murderer. Renth then sends
you to see Dok in Dok's Cigars. Find out all you can about the crime. He tells
you to go see the leader of Clan McMannus. This is the fishing village located
in West Karanas. Speak to the leader. Then speak to Ulrich McMannus and he tells
you Frostbite can track prey if he has a piece of sweaty clothing. Return to Dok
and ask him "Where is the sweaty shirt?". He then tells you he sold it to Tundra
Jack. Find Tundra Jack on the tundra of Everfrost. He will tell you that Iceberg
is using it for a collar and that you can distract Iceberg with his favorite
meal, Lion Delight. Go back to Halas and speak to Teria O' Danos. Do the lion
meat quest (you get coin and faction as well as the Lion Delight). Once you have
Lion Delight, be sure to bury it lower in your container then your normal food
to prevent it being eaten by you. Take the Lion Delight to Iceberg and receive
the shirt (NO DROP, LORE ITEM) and faction adjustment. Now run to the village
and give the shirt to Frostbite. (NOTE: Frostbite will wait for the murderer to
spawn before he takes off. He walks pretty fast so I wouls strongly suggest that
you have Spirit of Wolf on you. It also helps to have a party member along that
can track because I lost sight of Frostbite many times and have had to start
over. Also, Frostbite likes to fight things along the way. Help him out. Be very
careful not to target Frostbite by accident!) Frostbite will lead you right to
the criminal. The murderer will be either Paglan or Basil. Paglan is tougher to
kill and probably in his low to mid 20's, Basil is around level 20. Kill
whomever the dog leads you to, hope he drops a Barbarian head and then return to
Halas with the head. Give the head to Renth for faction, coin, and of course,
the Langseax (if you have Basil's head) or the Langseax of the Wolves (if it is
Paglan's head). I am not sure what triggers which criminal you get or even if
you can just kill both and get both heads, but it seems that you wil normally
get Basil. Short Version: Run to village, and receive the lion meat. Run to
Halas, turn in meat to Teria and get Lion Delight, faction, exp. and coin. Run
to Iceberg, give Lion Delight, receive shirt, faction, exp. Run to Frosbite,
give shirt, gain exp. Kill the criminal. Return head for faction, coin, exp and
Langseax. One thing to keep in mind is that your faction drops a good deal with
the thieves guild with this quest, and the banker in Halas is a thief, making it
possible that doint this quest can cause you to get kos if you try to use the
bank. Also, you need a high faction with the Wolves of the North to finish the
quest. The faction changes are as follows: When you complete the lion meat
quest: Shaman of Justice (+1), Wolves of the North (+1) Merchants of Halas (+1),
Rogues of the White Rose (-1); When you trick Iceberg and get the Sweaty Shirt:
Shaman of Justice (+1), Wolves of the North (+1), Merchants of Halas (+1), Steel
Warriors (+1), Rogues of the White Rose (-1); When you kill Paglan or Basil:
Rogues of the White Rose (-1); When you turn in Paglan's or Basil's head for
your reward: Shaman of Justice (-1), Wolves of the North (+1), Merchants of
Halas (-1), Rogues of the White Rose (+1); Faction adjustments overall: Shaman
of Justice (+1), Wolves of the North (+3), Merchants of Halas (+1), Steel
Warriors (+1), Rogues of the White Rose (-2).

Lion Meat</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is also a part of the
Langseax quest. If you talk to one of the merchants outside the city before the
lake, you can get a quest to get lion meat from the fishing village. Talk to
Einhorst McMannus in the barbarian fishing villiage in Western Karanas. He will
refer you to a female barbarian nearby to get the meat. You must say to her "I
will deliver the Lion Meat Shipment to Halas". You get some minor coin for this
quest. A good idea is to combine this quest with the note to Einhurst quest
since they both go to the same place.

Magic Elixir for the Warriors</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Dargon McPherson, outside of the Pit
of Doom, has a warm spot in his heart for his compatriots freezing and lonely
out in the everfrost peaks. He asks you to take a magic elixir to them to help
warm them up on their lonely vigil. There are four people to visit, each of whom
will tell you who and where the next one is. The activation sentence is "I will
deliver an Elixir to young warriors". The order of people are: Talin O'Donal (by
the 2 tents), Brydin McGill (by the 2 guard area stands next to snowflake),
Arnis McLish (next to the entrance to Black Burrow), Megan O'Reilly (at tower
next to the temple where Starn Barnjumper is, or ask snowflake). Your reward for
this is experience, faction, some money, a minor item and the warm feeling of
helping out your fellow Barbarians.

Note to Einhorst</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>First talk to Jinkus (he is in the
shaman's guild). He asks if you want to contribute to the guild. He tells you to
find Halana and tell her "Jinkus sent me to assist you". She is located in Ye
Majik shop in Halas) She askes you to take a note to Einhorst in the Barbarian
fishing village in West Karana and return with their monthly Karana Clover
shipment. She gives you directions if you dont know the way. To get to the
village go though Black Burrow to Qeynos Hills, follow the mountains to the left
until you hit a path, follow the path to the left, you will zone into West
Karana. In West Karana follow path until it splits turn right and head from the
path towards the horizon, the fishing village is not far. Einhorst is in one of
the buildings. You give him the note and get money, exp, a box of clover to
return to Holana and the following faction: Wolves of the North, Shaman of
Justice, Merchants of Halas and Steel Warriors increase; Rogues of the White
Rose decreases. When you give the box to Holana you get money, exp, an item and
the following faction: Shaman of Justice and Merchants of Halas increase; Circle
of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Tradefolk and Ebon Mask decrease. A good idea is
to combine this and the lion meat quest since they both go to the same place.

Give her 4 wristbands and she will give a <I>Seax</I> which is a mediocre
Barbarian piercing weapon usable by Rogues. It is possible that Lysbith will not
give you the quest till after you have done her Ice Goblin Necklace quest. She
also mentions a "Langseax" that is a 1H Slash Barbarian weapon for warriors.

spiders and collect 8 of the wooly fungus. The fungus can be found on all the
types of wooly spiders in Everfrost. When you combine the 8 fungus and give the
