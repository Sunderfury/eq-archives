The Bind</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Llscent Tagglefoot by the druids
guild is in a bind. He will say he needs somone to deliver a case of jumjum
juice to Xanuusus a treant in the Northern Karanas Plains. Say "I will take the
Jumjum Juice" and you will be provided with a case. Getting to Treant is a long
walk. Go to North Karana and follow the water to the right. When you hit the
mountains follow them and you will run right into him. I have been told you no
longer have to levitate to give him the jum jum juice. Also, apparantly Xanuusus
is not smart enough or just doesn't care to distinguish between the jum jum you
get from Llscent and that you find from looting bixies. Who's going to argue
with a Treant? So any case of jum jum juice will work. Factions go up with
StormReapers, MayorGubbin, and MerchantsofRiverVale, and went down with the
UnkemptDruids. You will also get some minor coin and a minor item. Considering
that bixies are very low level creatures and drop jum jum quite frequently, this
may be a good way for low level characters to make some money (Assuming you
survive the trek through N Karana).

Corrupt Guards</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Capt. Linarius at the top of the
bridge tower on the edge of the Northern Plains of Karana wants you do help him
root out corruption among the guards. He will ask you to seek out and find any
corrupt guards, to kill them and bring back their guard bracelets to him. Now
there is a guard tower located between the river and the valley which leads to
Qeynos Hills in Western Karanas near the fishing village. In this guard tower is
a guard named Guard Donlan. When you talk to Donlan you discover that he is
charging people a travel tax of 1 gp to travel on the roads. Guard McLosky, in
that same tower, has also been corrupted. Kill either or both and return his
bracelet for experience, faction, some money and an item (which varies widely
from minor items to some pretty nice ones if your faction is good enough - I
have been told of someone who got a <I>Bunker Battle Blade</I>). Remember that
he wants the bracelets of corrupt guards. If you kill a good guard and bring the
Captain his bracelet, your reception will not be quite as friendly.

Going Postal</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a massive quest involving
most of the cities in Norrath. See the full quest description in Ak'Anon and the
reference table at the end of this

Research Aid</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Mrysila in the gypsy camp has a
quest for good magic users. Give her a lightstone and she will give you either
Runes &amp; Research Volume I or Runes &amp; Research Volume II. Be warned that
what you get is random and not dependant upon which one you already have. I got
two volume ones for my two lightstones. For a greater lightstone she will give
you the Concordance of Research, which is what you use to combine the
ingredients to get the practice runes. The research materials are (or will soon
be) posted on Mithiran Tower. The best part of this quest is that the
Concordance sells for about 8 platinum to any of the other gypsies. Therefore,
you should never sell your greater lightstone to an a vendor for the offered 4
pp. Instead, you should take it here where you can get a both decent amount of
xp and 8 pp by doing this quest. [Thanks Wester Windwolf for helping me on this
quest]. The details on research from the two Runes and Research volumes can be
found on <I>Mithiran Tower's Researcher Guide to Practice Runes</I>.

Tiny Skeletons</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest originates in Ak'Anon
with Narron Jenork at the Gemchoppers Guile, but I don't think you really have
to start it there. You need good faction with the Gemchoppers to complete the
quest. There is a gnome guard named Watchman Dexlin that sometimes spawns at the
stone bridge in North Karana. Bilbis Briar is his placeholder, and he is a
fairly rare spawn. Hail him and he says he's in need of a brave warrior. Say I
am a brave warrior and he will tell you that he is looking for the remains of
tiny skeletons. If you have aimiable or better faction for the Gemchoppers he
gives you a box with 4 slots and tells you to collect the remains (and you will
take a hit with your gemchopper faction for some reason). After he gives you the
box tiny skeletons will spawn between the stone bridge and the gypsy camp
somewhere. They're around level 15. Kill them and they drop a crumpled skeleton
remains. He tells you to return with them before his sundial reaches 8, and I
have been told that if you don't do this fast snough he will not give you
anything for the box, but I am not sure how the timing is supposed to work. The
tiny skeletons are hard to find, they're as small as brownies so a ranger with
tracking would be a big help on this quest. When you get four and skeletons,
combine them in the box and give it back to him. He will then give you back a
box and tell you to return it to Narron Jenork in Ak'Anon. When you do, he gives
you a nice pair of <I>Watchman Boots</I>.

Werewolf Hunters</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Occasionally you will see four
NPC's, a dwarf, 2 gnomes and a barbarian, running real fast near the north
mountains. If you catch them and hail them, they mention that they are hunting
werewolves. I am not sure if this quest actually goes anywhere.

Winds of Karana</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is another of the multiple part
quests. When heading into Southern Karana, from Northern Karana mind you, there
is a tower just before the bridge. Just outside the tower doors are four very
large horn like structures. Standing beside one is a female bard. If you talk to
her, and ask if there is anything you can do for her, she relays a sad story of
a hermit who stole her flute. Now, head into Southern Karana. Head straight
south, making sure to give a wide berth to the Grave Yard of Lord Grimrot. About
half way through the zone is a fountain, with Vhalen standing there. Vhalen, who
is also the object of the broken Lute quest for bards, has an offer for you. He
will complete his latest masterpiece for you. Of course, he needs something for
this. Two sheets of a song. Pages 1 and 2 of the Winds of Karana. He tells you
of a man who has stolen these pages. A vile man of a Hermit. Sound familiar eh?
Now, head southeast till you see a cottage. It has a hexagonal wall of stone
surrounding it, so it's not hard to find. Inside the walls is "a hermit." A very
unfriendly sort. Here's where the quests takes one of two paths. The door to the
hermits house is either locked, or broken and won't open. So it's hard to get to
him. If you slide past the door slowly you may be able to see him and target
him. Now, if you want to talk to him, you can go behind the house, stand EXACTLY
against the chimney that protrudes and banter with him. He's very hard to
convince to talk, and the sentence basically has to say something to the effect
of "where is the flute" though this isn't the exact wording, (I got it right
once out of 6 attempts) Now, if you do talk to him, he has twoquests you can
achieve from him (More on these later) in which you kill two people and bring
proof to him for the Flute and the Page. Now, as it's hard to get through the
door, and thus hard to exchange the items to him, there is ONE other manner to
do this quest. Target him, as before, and begin an attack. Spells will draw him
out just fine. After he is dead, his body will contain the Flute, Page 1 of the
Winds of Karana or just one or the other. At this point, some factions will go
up, down and you will no doubt gain some good experience. I estimate him to be
around level 19-20. Now, head back into Northern Karana, and hand the flute over
to the bard sitting against the pillar. She, as thanks, will give you Page 2 of
the winds of Karana, some experience, faction and occasionally a small cash
reward. You are almost complete. Head back into Southern Karana and hand both
the pages to Vhalen at the same time. You will gain Faction, a small amount of
money, and a Bard song. This song appears to be random. I got the 3rd song,
another got the 4th song. </FONT><BR></DIV>
