Head of Granin O'Gill</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is given to you from
Margyn McCann (she is the Shaman's guildmaster). The activation sentence is "I
am a young shaman". She tells you that she wants Granin O'Gill brought to
justice by bringing her his head. He can be found by the statue area of
Everfrost. Do even try to find him until you are 13th or in a large group. The
Orc Shamans and Orc Mountaineers spawn in the same area and will wipe you out
fast. He hits hard (20 points a pop) and casts spells, but he does not have alot
of hit points. When you return his head to Margyn you get faction, exp, a few
coppers (joy), and a 1st rank spell. This quest can only be performed by
characters below level 12.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020187"></A><BR></DIV>

Ice Goblin Necklaces</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Approach the Female Warrior named
Lysbith McNaff in the Pit of Doom and ask her about ice goblins. She wants you
to gather Ice Bead Necklaces from the Ice Goblins that roam Everfrost. The
activation sentence is "I will protect the pass". If you choose to accept her
quest, she will give you a box with six slots in it for you to use. Collect 6
necklaces, combine them and return to her for a minor item, money and some
experience. Generous isn't she? </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020188"></A><BR></DIV>

Ivan McMannus' Remains</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Renth McLanis in McDaniels Smokes
and Spirits seeks to find the remains of Ivan McMannus. He was supposed to
escort Ivan who is a courier, but he ended up drinking the night away and Ivan
got killed. Now he needs to find Ivan's Remains, but he doesn't know they are
located. If you tell him that you will [search for the courier], he will direct
you to Arnis McLish out in Everfrost who will then direct you to the lady who
knows where the remains are (Megan). Arnis tends to hang out around the ramp
into Black Burrow, but he runs around quite a bit in the area. You may have to
chase him down or wait for him to come back. He will tell you that Snowflake
(her pet wolf) can lead you to Megan if you ask him [where is Megan]? Snowflake
is located by the two guards area on the edge of the tundra. Snowflake will lead
you to Megan who is by the North Tower. If you ask Megan "Where are Ivan's
remains?", she will then tell you her sad story and ask if you [will dive for
remains]. When you tell her that you will, she hands you the special box needed
to complete the quest. The remains are at the bottom of the river and you have
to access them through a hole in the ice. There are at least two holes in the
river; the correct one is near the south side of the river and has a large piece
of white ice jutting out of the frozen river next to the hole. When you dive, as
you descend toward the north you will see a goblin diver. I killed this one and
he only had an ice goblin necklace. The next goblin north of that one had a
barbarian rib in his loot. Fighting the goblins below water is difficult (they
are fast) so I lured them out of the hole in the ice to kill them on the frozen
river surface. The rest of the bones are located on the river floor and look
like small bags. The items you collect are: Barbarian rib, skull, jaw, and
femur. The very first item is almost directly below the hole in the ice (was the
femur for me). The other two items are further to the north along the very
bottom of the river. I suggest returning to the surface to get a fresh air
supply between grabbing each item. The furthest piece is dangerously far from
the hole. A person needs a swimming skill of around 30 to swim straight to the
furthest item and still be able to return to the hole before drowning. Once you
have all four items, you combine them in the box and give them back to Renth
McLanis. He will reward you with experience, some money, and a minor item.

Karg Icebear</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Karg Icebear wanders the tundra,
often passing by the North Tower. He can make lupine (werewolf) and polar bear
armor if you have the right components and cash compensation. A polar bear skin
(cannot be ruined) and 5 pp will get you the <I>Polar Bear Cloak</I>. A werewolf
claw, a rare drop by werewolves in W Commons, and 75 plat, will get you some
<I>Lupine Claw Gauntlets</I> and a werewolf skin and 100 pp will get you a
<I>Werewolf Skin Cloak</I>.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020190"></A><BR></DIV>

Magic Elixir for the Warriors</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Dargon McPherson, outside of the Pit
of Doom, has a warm spot in his heart for his compatriots freezing and lonely
out in the everfrost peaks. He asks you to take a magic elixir to them to help
warm them up on their lonely vigil. There are four people to visit, each of whom
will tell you who and where the next one is. The activation sentence is "I will
deliver an Elixir to young warriors". The order of people are: Talin O'Donal (by
the 2 tents), Brydin McGill (by the 2 guard area stands next to snowflake),
Arnis McLish (next to the entrance to Black Burrow), Megan O'Reilly (at tower
next to the temple where Starn Barnjumper is, or ask snowflake). Your reward for
this is experience, faction, some money, a minor item and the warm feeling of
helping out your fellow Barbarians.

Tarton's Wheel</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest to get the
components for the Wizard Spell Ice Comet. There are 3 NPC's standing along ice
wall near Starn bearjumpers place. Talk with the human wizard Sulgar and he will
tell you that he is looking for tartons wheel. (you must have good faction with
beta neutral to get this quest - unfortunatley, I have no idea what you can do
to raise this faction). He gives you a glowing case and a tome of hints that
spans all over the 3 continents. The case is to hold the spokes of the wheel and
the tome gives you hints on where to find the pieces. Be aware that the case is
a no rent item and will disappear when you log out, so don't put any rods in it
until you are ready to give them to Sulgar. Tartons wheel apparently lets you
travel through the planes. You combine the pieces you find in the box and get
The <I>Staff of the Wheel</I> (a 1HB weapon) and the star of eyes (a gem which
casts unlimited identify spells). When you give them to him, he will give you
the runes of frost and astral needed to research the ice comet spell. (Then pray
your research doesn't fail). There are 10 pieces that you need scattered across
the face of Norrath. The names of the 10 rods are: Azia, Beza, Caza, Dena, Ena,
Fana, Geza, Heda, Izah, Jaka. Be aware that the rods spawn very rarely, are no
drop items, and are just laying there for anyone to pick up (They are just
called "a rod", and identify as wizard only) so they will be very difficult to
get to in time. Of course, if you are not a wizard, please leave these rods
alone, since, as a no drop and thus nonsaleable item, they are of no value to
anyone other than a high level wizard on this quest. The locations are as
follows: (1) [azia] On the ocean floor in Eruds Crossing past the zombie boat
where the zombie sailors hang out. (location - neg 1162, pos 2340); (2) [beza]
In the underwater cave in the Everfrost plains. It is in the "house" all the way
back and right in the cave, where 3 dry bones guard it in the center of the
room; (3) [caza] Lake Rathe. Underneath the first island you see is an
underwater tunnel leading to a stone tower. Its on the top floor of the tower.
(You need enduring breath for this one); (4) [Dena] Dagnor's cauldron, right
outside the entrance to Kedge Keep. If you face with your back to Kedge, it is
directly diagagonal left, in a corner.; (5) [Ena] Lower Guk in the Reanimated
hand room. This one is the only one you need a group for, unless you're brave
and kamakazi it. Warning, the floor is the same color as the rod in this room
and it makes it very hard to find with the hand and the dar beating on you; (6)
[Fana] Oasis of Marr in the underwater tower next to the above ground tower, on
the top floor; (7) [Geza] Highhold Pass in the water near the waterfall closest
to the Tiger Inn. There are 2 waterfalls there. The rod is in front of the one
closest to the inn; (8) [Heda] Qeynos Aqueducts, in the shark pit; (9) [Izah]
Neriak in the water in front of the bar called "the blind fish". The bar has 4
glass windows that are underwater, and the rod spawns right in front of those
windows; (10) [Jaka] Unrest in the water outside the right side of the house
near where the the gnome speulunker is. Instead of going into the tunnel that
leads to him, you go a little right of that entrance and there's a very short
passage where you can find the rod.

The Vengeful Musicians</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There are 3 skeletons wandering
everfrost that are about level 10 - 13: vengeful soloist, vengeful composer and
vengeful lyricist. They carry pages 74, 75 and 76 of Delius Thymes' Diary. These
items are no save, no drop, lore items, so you lose them when you log out. Give
the 3 pages to Delius' sister, Thadres, by the well in Halas. You get a tiny bit
of experience and one of four tomes listing various brewing recipes.
