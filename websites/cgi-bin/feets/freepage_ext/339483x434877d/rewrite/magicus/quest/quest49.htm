refer to the general level of critters in the area, so you know not to stop at
all. Take care that you don't stop in difficult places like Steamfont, until you
KNOW you are safe. Pay attention to what the NPC's say. In Freeport, Felisity is
for letters, and Ton is for Mailbags (in general - it has been said that there
is an error on these, btw.) but there are times when you will simply get a Thank

How to make Ronium</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Lord Searfire, the Dwarven
Smith in The Temple of Solusek Ro. He must consider you warmly before he will
deal with you. He will then give you the Sol Cauldron and tell you how to do the
next step, which is acquiring the ingredients to make the metal ronium. These
are: Melatite (Dropped by MB and MC Clockworks in Solusek's Eye. You can also
sometimes buy them from the Gnomes in Solusek's Eye since many players sell them
if they find them), Two Bars of Enchanted Platinum, Mistmoore Granite (from
Gargoyles in Mistmoore), the Sands of Ro (from sand giants) and Soil of
Underfoot (Get from Priestess Ghalea in the Kaladim cleric's guild for 4 fairy
dusts [need very high faction for this]). Put them in the cauldron and hit the
combine button and you will get a bar of ronium. I have been told you no longer
need a blacksmithing skill to combine these, but cannot confirm
this</FONT><BR></DIV>

The Quest for the Fiery Avenger?</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><B>MAJOR WARNING</B>: This quest was
sent to me unsolicited and has not been verified in any way. I am printing it
belwo exactly as sent to me. It is either acurate or a very impressive hoax,
because the detail is amazing and enough of the information corresponds to items
and quests which I can verify actually exist to make it seem valid. If you do
this, be aware that it will require a huge amount of time to complete as well
aas the sacrifice of several highly sought after items such as Soulfire. The
reward is said to be the best sword in the game, which is wielded by Aradune
yourself. If you do it all and get nothing, just consider yourself forewarned.
</FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The following information is
undisclosed. No you did not read it here; you did not read anything at all.
</FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Below is an account of the steps
taken in order to acquire an elusive, highly prized sword. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You will require extraordinary
faction with the paladins of North Freeport, and with the paladins in Erudin.
When considering an individual of either faction, "judges you amiably" will not
suffice. You need to be one step above this, "smiles/considers you
kindly/warmly". In order to raise faction with the paladins of Erudin, you can
acquire a quest to gather zombie skins. Slay zombie sailors in Erud's Crossing,
harvest 4 flesh and return them for faction. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading721"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Part 1: </H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There is a high elf paladin in the
Felwithe Paladin guild, in the basement that will reward you for completing the
quest of returning Dvinn's Black Heart to him. There is a hidden quest here that
he will not reveal to you unless you take the initiative. Slay Lord Grimrot in
South Karana to earn "Lord Grimrot's Misshapen Heart". Trade this to the paladin
and with appropriate faction, he will reveal to you that a former knight one
quested after a "sword that purifies evil with fire". Take the note he gives to
you and seek out the Drunk, a high elf, former knight it seems, wandering in
Greater Faydark. Give him the note, which he reads, but decides not to give his
information freely. The Drunk hands you a bottle, a two container slot, and
requests an unusual drink before he "spills his secrets". The first of two
drinks is the "Tagglefoot Tingle Drink". This item is sometimes awarded by
returning Runnyeye Warbeads to Rivervale in a side quest. The second drink is
created through Brewing. Find a craftsman to brew an Ogre Swill. The ingredients
for this mix are a malt, yeast, froglock meat, and a cask. Combine the two
drinks in the bottle, and return this to the Drunk. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading722"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Part 2: </H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The drunkard is impressed by the
drink and unravels his tale. Apparently he once sought a "sword of fire", but
inevitably gave up. He hands you an "Obsidian Key", and when you check your
inventory, there is also a "Key Ring" present. He mentions that there are three
keys he was after, but does not explain further, nor what the purpose of the
keys is for. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The second key is the "Shiny Brass
Key". This item is found off the Ghoul Magi in Unrest. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The third key is a bit more elusive.
In the Abbey of the Muse in Ak'anon, city of gnomes, you will find the cleric
AND rogue guilds. The rogue guild is behind an illusionary wall, and behind an
additional hidden wall within this complex is a gnome rogue, a master locksmith.
Hailing him he talks about a "skeleton key" that is rumored to open many kinds
of locks. When you ask him about the key, he hints that a rogue carried this
key, but drowned long ago with a sinking ship. Venture to the Ocean of Tears.
Directly north of the small island with the dinosaur, and slightly to the left
(near the isle of aviaks), dive deep under the water and near the bottom is an
alcove with a zombie sailor type. Killing him you find find the key on his body,
which is actually called the "Mythral Key". </FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Combine the three keys in the "Key
Ring", a 3 slot container, and create the "Key Set". </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading723"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Part 3: </H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Venture to Erudin, to a chamber in
one of the zones that constitutes the city. It is a long hallway with doors on
both sides, one set of which leads to the bank. On the wall opposite the side
with the "Bank of Erudin", enter the chamber and locate the illusionary wall.
What is surprising about this setup is that the lower half of the wall is an
illusion and fake, but the upper half is real! If you simply walk into the wall
you not be able to pass, but your feet will stick through the base of the wall.
In order to pass through this obstacle, you must be of gnome size and crouch
low, or as of a recent patch, have a Shaman cast the spell "Shrink" on you. When
you pass through the wall, you will come to a lobby room of sorts, a cubical
with a door before you. Hold the "Key Set" with the mouse cursor and click on
the door. The door will unlock and allow you to enter. Inside is a study room of
sorts, but also a living space and inside a human paladin in chain armor (not
plate like the guild knights in Freeport and Qeynos). </FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Hail the man and he mentions two
things. He asks for his keys to the chamber that he lost (ignore this for now),
or you can ask him who he is. Apparently he is a former knight, seeking sanction
in Erudin from the oppresive world. He is a bit curious/suspicious of your
presence and requests/demands that you prove your worth. He hands you a small
bag, with four container slots. The knight says that the "spawn of the burning
prince" must be stopped, and his skin brought back as proof of his demise. The
Burning Prince is the name of Solusek Ro, god of fire, and the spawn is none
other than Lord Nagafen. You are required to obtain not one, but three red
dragon scales off the wyrm. "Red Dragon Scales" is a moderately uncommon
treasure item on the beast. Zero to as many as three (rarely) can be found on
any one of his corpses. You will most likely have to slay the dragon three of
four times to acquire an adequate supply. The fourth item to be placed in the
bag is a hammer. The reclusive paladin mentions a magic hammer to forge a blade
like none other. The hammer he speaks of is the "Thex Mallet", which is involved
or referred to in at least two other quests, or can be used as a weapon after
obtaining it. To acquire the Mallet, slay the Elf Skeleton behind the third
locked door in Befallen. He drops either the "Head" or "Hilt", so kill the
undead several times to get both pieces. Also on the third floor is Commander
Windstream, a level 20 or so zombie. He carries the "stem", a two slot container
in which you place both mallet pieces. Combine and create the hammer. Place the
dragon scales and mallet into the bag and return to Erudin to the hermit.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Hand the combined quest items to the
knight. When you hail the knight now, he does mention "returning his keys", or
"proving your worth". Instead he presents a different option. He mentions
"supplies". Upon questioning his further, he hands you a piece of paper, a
"list" of sorts, with various blacksmithing components noted, such as sheet of
metal, ore, etc. Keep the list and gather the blacksmithing craft items. You
will need to find a blacksmith to forge you some pieces. It is important to hail
him along two different quest lines, in order to obtain both the list, and the
backpack to combine all the smithing supplies. (Similar to the Ice Comet quest
in which you get both a book and the wheel container, but separately). Return
the backpack to the knight and he will tell you to return at sunrise, in one
day's time. At this point he poofs. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Note: The knight will return to the
room at 6am. Use the /time command to keep track. However it is important to
realize that twenty four hours must have also passed in order for the room to be
occupied once again. Example: If you returned the blacksmithing backpack to him
at 11pm, he will not be there at 6am because only seven hours passed, so an
extra day must pass. However if you return the supplies to him at 5am, you will
only have to wait 25 hours. </FONT><BR></DIV>

Part 5: </H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The following morning, the knight
will be back in the room, available for passers-by to initiate the quest.
Hailing him he requests the return of his keys, or proving your worth, just as
before. This time return the keys which you should have kept up until now. He
thanks you, and on the side, asks if you have seen his list. You should still
have the list of supplies as well. By giving him the list, you open up the next
part of the quest. He says that while you were gone, he had the Deepwater
Knights forge a sword in reward for your heroism and courage, using the supplies
and magical properties of the dragon scales. That is no doubt where the need for
the mallet came into play. In any case, you are awarded a "Forged Deepwater
Blade". [Forged Deepwater Blade Dmg: 18 Dly: 40 Class: Paladin] Venture to North
Freeport, where the Paladin Guild of the Marr twins can be found. Find the guild
master of the guild, the one that a level 1 paladin human would present his
guild note to. Hailing him will not present any recognition of the journey you
have completed so far. At this point, you must have the "Soulfire". This holy
sword is a prequisite for the last and final phase of this quest. In the trade
window with the paladin knight, place both the Soulfire AND the Forged Deepwater
Blade. If one OR the other is placed in the window alone, he will simply say
"thank you", and your sword will vanish. Killing the knight will not get the
sword(s) back from his corpse. You gain experience upon delivering both swords.
Your additional reward is a scroll, as the knight speaks of a "flaming sword" to
champion justice. The "Forged Deepwater Blade" will be found in your inventory
once again (placed their automatically), but the "Soulfire" is sacrificed at
this stage. Take the blade and the scroll and consult the leader of the Cleric
guild in North Freeport, the temple of Marr. Hand the sealed scroll (you cannot
read its contents) to the guild master, who casts some form of blessing/spell
upon you. No effect will be readily noticeable, but upon searching your
inventory: The "Forged Deepwater Blade" of the Deepwater Knights of Erudin is
replaced/transformed into a/the Fiery Avenger. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This sword is not an artifact, but
the quest is long and involved, demanding the pursuit of not just the deepwater

Quest for the Fiery Avenger</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Basically I have no idea where this
begins or what it involves at this time. People have been sending in information
and conjecture on it. Some things to consider that I have gleaned from the mail
coming in: </FONT><BR></DIV>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Rumors have it
that you need to kill both dragons and several other level 50 plus creatures to
get it.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>I was
also told that you might start this by talking to one of the sphinxes in Rathe
Mts, but can't confirm.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>It might
be that you need to talk to something in a language other than common to find
the quest.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You also
might need to talk to something you don't usually consider hailing. Anyone try
talking to a dragon in dragon? Just a thought.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Qeynos
is the only major city without a major holy artifact.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The most
obvious unsolved high level quest is the tome of ages quest in OOT. Although
with the many evil NPC's involved, I tend to believe that is not for the fiery
avenger. Nonetheless, it can't be discounted. It does involve drops from each
dragon, which means it is very high level.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There
are other unsolved quests throughout the quest list. Once the final solution to
soulfire came in, it turned out that I had most of the quest already listed in
bits and pieces throughout the quest list. It may be that a clue lies in there
somewhere.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There
are a number of Paladin quests that result in fairly minor items. (Highkeep,
Butcherblock). It is possible that these quests are all intertwined into the
Fiery Avenger quest.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Quests
often need phrases that are not in brackets, so ask every likely candidate about
the quest in every way you can think of.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The
quest came out at the same time as the Paineel patch, so it is likely that some
major feature lies in Paineel. A quick guess would be that you have to kill a
NPC in Paineel for part of the quest. You might also consider that Paineel's
biggest enemies are the Erudites, so they may play a role.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The
quest may even originate in Paineel. There is a shopkeeper who seems to be a
secret worshipper of Tunare. Certainly putting a good quest in the heart of an
evil city would be a way to make it very hard to find.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There
are unusual Paladins in several zones that may apply: The Ogre Paladin in
Freeport, The Undead Knight in Unrest, The Shin Lord in Guk, etc. It just might
be a matter fo finding the right phrase with one of these.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Symbol" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Abashi
has said that the quest can be done now, and you don't need to wait for the
expansion. </FONT></UL><DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Also, I have
been sent this poem. It is not from an official source and seems to refer to the
princess lenia quest in Highkeep. That quest results in a Paladin Shield and was
recently solved, so it may be that this is a red herring or maybe, since the
reward for that quest is relatively weak for what you need to do, the shield in
needed for the fiery avenger. </FONT><BR></DIV>
