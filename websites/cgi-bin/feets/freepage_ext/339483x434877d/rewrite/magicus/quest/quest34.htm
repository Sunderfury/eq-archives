Paineel</H1>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>From what I can tell, every quest
results in the same faction changes: Postive Faction for Heretics, and negative
faction for Deepwater Knights, Gate Callers, Craft Keepers, and Crimson Hands.

The Advertisement<A NAME="_Toc476020435"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Pardas Nalue, the clothing merchant,
tells you he has been slaving over a new advertisement for his store. If you
answer Yes, I would care to hear your new advertisement....or something to that
effect he tells you his slogan. This might not even be a quest, but may simply
be color. </FONT><BR></DIV>

Bats and Beetles</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Dzan Amo needs some things fetched
from the creatures just outside our city for some ritual experimentation. Bring
him two tufts of bat fur and two fire beetles legs and receive a low level
clerics spell. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020436"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading353"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Bats and Snakes</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Coriante Verisue will assign new
heretics the basic task of gathering bat wings and snake fangs from outside the
city. He will reward you for every two bat wings and snake fangs you bring back.
You will get a low level necromancer spell, usually Cackling Bones.

Cat Courier</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Tell Antus Shelbra that you are an
experienced Heretic and he will assign you an appropriate task for you. In Kerra
Ridge, there is a particular cat man named Marran Mirrah that the Heritics have
been using to gather information about certain aspects of Cat society. He is no
longer providing information so they have put together something for him that
will encourage him to assist again. You are given a sealed bag for us to carry
to him that supposedly will change his point of view. Marran will not respond to
a hail, so you must simply give the bag to him on the run or wait till he stops.
Upon giving the bag he goes berserk and attacks, casting lightning and life
drain. He is not easy to kill (probably on par with High Priestess Mitty), but
you don't have to kill him. Just run away if you can. You will find you have a
kerran head in your inventory (presumable of one of his relatives, which would
explain why he went berzerk -- hey you are a follower of evil you know).
Returned the head to Antus in exchange for some faction, a small amount of money
and some exp.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020438"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading355"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Experienced Courier<A NAME="_Toc476020439"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Tell Davorre Bloodthorn you are
experienced and willing to assist him and he will assign you with a task. He
gives you a note to deliver to his lost love Veisha Fathomwalker, who is
patrolling the outer regions of Toxullia Forest. She is only there at night.
After you deliver the note from Davorre Bloodthorn to Veisha Fathomwalker, she
mentions that her new love is Phaeril, who apparantly is the captain of the
guard. She gives you Veishas' Engagment ring (Lore, no drop) along with xps and
faction and tells you to give it back to Bloodthorn. Giving the ring to
Bloodthorn gives you xps and Faction. In a presumed fit of jealousy, he tells
you to find this man, kill him, and bring back his head. Phaeril can be found at
the same spot you found Veisha, only he is there during the day. He is about
level 30. When you kill him, you chop off his head and bring it back to Davorre
who gives it back to you nicely packaged in a box as a present to Veisha. (gory
ain't it?). Give her the box and she will freak out and try to kill you. After
you polish her off, you need to bring her head back to Davorre to prove your
deed and he will reward you with a <I>Battle Worn Halberd</I>. I have been told
that you can skip all of the steps and just kill Veisha and return her head for
the Halberd. Just be aware that she is a paladin and has lay on hands available.

The Fisherman</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Tell Antus Shelbra that you have
much to learn and he will assign you a task. There is an old and frail Erudite
male that now lives in Toxxulia Forest named Aglthin Dasmore. He has left the
ways of Cazic Thule and no longer practices the craft of evil. He has been
stripped of his power and his wealth, so he spends his time fishing by the
river. Your task is to slay him and bring back proof of the deed. He is a fairly
low level and doesn't cast spells. When you kill him, he drops a lore no drop
fishing pole. Bring the fishing pole back to Antus and You receive good faction
with Heretics, and bad with Gatekeepers, DeepwaterKnights, Craftkeepers and
Crimson Hands as well as the <I>Staff of the Abbattoir Initiate</I>.

The Lost Pet</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Noclin Saah, who is usually found
running in the tunnel between Paineel and the newbie zone, says that he has lost
his pet and it is attacking new apprentices in the yard. He is afraid that if
his master finds out, his guild will punish him. Kill his pet, named Noclin's
Pet (approximately level 4), and give him a No Drop Lore Item called a rotting
femur. Several factions change, and you receive a very nice 1hb necro weapon
called <I>Noclin's Femur</I>. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020441"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading358"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Neonate Cowardice<A NAME="_Toc476020442"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Tell Davorre Bloodthorn you are a
neonate and he says that he can make use of your pathetic cowardice. Ask him how
he can make use of you pathetic cowardice and he will give you a list to take to
Auhirk Siet'ka. Taking the list to Anhuirk gets you a small sealable bag which
he says you need to fill with a bat wing, snake egg, rat ear and beetle eye. (It
is possible that you can skip right to this step). He warns you to seal the bag
before you bring it back. The bag now has (or soon will have) a combine button.
Combine the ingredients and return them for some xp, faction and change

The Rituals of Fear</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Atdehim Sqonci and ask him
about the rituals of fear. He says that he is working on a ritual to strike fear
into the hearts of the other inhabitants of Odus. The reagents he requires for
this ritual are the doll of a kerran priestess (drops from more than Kerran
priestesses), the ichor of a wooly spider, a medium quality cat pelt, and a
giant snake fang with which to carve his glyphs. Bring these back for some xp,
gold and items (usually ringmail). </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020443"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading360"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Secrets of Fear</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Sern Adolia and tell him
that you seek the knowledge of the secrets of fear. He will tell you to first
prove your devotion to the temple. There are pack rats within the city that have
a habit of getting into things. Some of these rats have ingested a concoction
developed by the necromancers of this great city. The rats have since died, and
due to the concoction their undead corpses now roam the fields. Bring him four
of the livers from these undead rats so that we may examine them. Bring them
back for experience, faction and a decent low level item such as a rawhide cap.

<A NAME="Heading361"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Summoning of Dread<A NAME="_Toc476020445"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Nivold Predd and ask him
about the summoning of dread. He needs you to fetch some components essential to
the summoning of the avatar of dread. He requires the eye of a griffon, some
powder of reanimation, the brain of the Ishva Mal (in Splitpaw), and the toes of
an ice giant. For the powder of reanimation, he further tells you that there is
a gnome necromancer that has been experimenting with a powder used in the
reanimating long dead organic tissue who is known to frequent places populated
by undead in order to pursue his research. If you talk to the gnome necromancer
in Unrest (found on second floor) whose first name is Khrix and ask about the
powder he will ask for a fire beetle eye to see his way out. He then tells you
you must defeat his abomination in order to get the powder. The abomination is a
ghoul that spawns in the room directly behind Khrix's closet. It is very
powerful maybe 35-40. Killing the abomination gets you the reanimation powder
(no drop). The result of this quest is the Dread Forged Shield (AC 17. +5 stam,
+5 wis, +10 char, +20 mana, +10 magic prot. Wt. 1.5. Human or Erudite Cleric
only). </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading362"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Summoning of Fear<A NAME="_Toc476020446"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Sern Adolia and ask him
about summoning the avatar of fright. He require some special components for the
ritual. Fetch him the flesh of a zombie, the dust used in the process of
mummification (Embalming dust - dropped by mummies), charred bone chips, and a
vial of Tunares Breath. For charred bone chips, you need to go to one of the
Ro's and seek out a flaming skeleton. For The Vial of Tunare's breath, you need
to contact (or kill) a druid named Kalayia in Lesser Faydark, who is a very rare
spawn. Bring him the items and you will get a Fright Forged Helm [AC 11, +2 STR,
-5 CHA, +4 WIS. Effect of Deadeye. Weight 5.5. magic, no drop, lore. Human or
Erudite cleric only]. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading363"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Summoning of Terror</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Miadera Shadowfyre and she
will tell you that she seeks a fellow apostle of Cazic Thule to assist her in
the [summoning of terror]. Ask her what summoning of terror and she will say
that it will be a frightfully fulfilling summons. To do this, she needs an eye
of urd, some basalt drake scales, the lens of Lord Soptyver (located in
Beholder), and a lock of widowmistress hair (located in Najena). For you
efforts, you will get a <I>Terror Forged Mask</I>. (Warning, This item may have
changed in the recent patch). </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020447"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading364"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Waylaid Courier</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Sherva Kollintar asks you if you
want to make yourself useful. Tell her that you will make myself useful and she
assignes you a task. One of their spies has reported sighting of Malik Zaren, a
courier of the High Council of Erudin resting at an inn called Golden Roosters
in High Pass Hold enroute to Erudin Palace. Sherva believes that he may be
carrying a message containing information of great value to the Heritics. She
wants you to hunt him down and return the letter that he carries. Your reward is
xp, money and an item (such as blackened iron). </FONT><BR></DIV>
