The Clothspinner Sisters</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You will occasionally see an NPC
running around outside the gates whose last name is Clothspinner. Knowledge of
this quest is still developing, but here are the basics. Talk to her and hear
her tale of woe. She will tell you that she misses her warrior sister, and will
give you a letter to deliver to her sister somewhere in the Karanas. The sister
is located in East Karana in a cave. Deliver the note to her, and she will thank
you and give you a monogrammed cloth to take back to her sister. She will then
be rewarded for talking to you by being attacked by a guard and killed. Bet that
makes you feel good. If you kill the guard and the sister lives, she also gives
you a veil to give to the sister. When you give the original sister the cloth
she will send you with a note to the Temple of Life. If you give her the veil,
you get a decent item as well. There you may or may not be rewarded, depending
it seems upon your alignment and religion.

Milea Clothspinner</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>A Cleric Guildmaster at the shrine
of Bertoxxulous tells you about the dalliance between Commander Kane and Milea
Clothspinner. He wants her eliminated. Venture to Eastern Karanas to the cave
where Milea makes her home, do her in, and return with proof of her death for
faction and experience. Be forewarned that this quest will not make you friends
with Commander Kane. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020157"></A><BR></DIV>

Sir Morgan's Armor</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>At the zone border of Eastern
Karana, by the qeynos road marker is a knight, Sir Morgan, and his squire. Sir
Morgan needs money to upkeep his rusty armor. Give him 5 gold and you will get a
random item. Some of these can be pretty nice. Items I have been told he has
given out include the following: Patchwork cloak; Patchwork boots; Rusty
Weapons; Silver Earring; Bloodstone; Halfling knife; 1st level spell scroll;
Bronze Dagger; Belt pouch; Damask cap; Mountain Lion Cape; Highkeep Flask;
Snakeskin Mask; Drom's Champagne.</FONT><BR></DIV>
