Cleric Items</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Blaize the Radiant and Gavel the
Temperant will make special items for Clerics. You need to fetch and return the
corresponding icon and ingot along with the bars of the specified type of
platinum to get the item. The icons and ingots only spawn a few times each day.
</FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading640"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Boots of the Reliant: (Blaize)</H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You need the ingot and icon of
Reliant and 1 bar of enchanted platinum. Go to Kithicor Woods, in one of the
burnt houses you will find a book (looks like a bag on the floor). The book will
reveal that Turgan the Reliant lived here once, and his brother perished in the
fire that burnt the house. It also states that one of the items is hidden in
Kithicor. This is the Ingot of the Reliant. Look for it on one of the tree
stumps in Kithicor Woods (it is among a group of stumps). You need to jump off a
fallen tree to get onto the stump, or use levitate. The book also states that
Turgan has moved to Lake Rathetear. There, he is situated off to the left of
Gnoll Camp. Hailing him is useless, as well as asking him about the Icon of the
Reliant (he will shout at you and tell you to go away). Give him the book and he
will give you the Icon.</FONT><BR></DIV>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You need the ingot and icon of
Reverent and 2 bars of enchanted platinum. Speak with a Gypsy named Lianna
Ferasa in the Rathe Mts. Ask her what has become of Regis the Reverent and she
will tell you that he was killed in the N Karanas by an evil man named Zahal the
Vile. She says if you go kill Zahal the Vile, Regis' body will rise from the
dead where he was killed along the NE tree line of the zone. She also asks that
if he has her flute on his body to bring it to her. Zahal the Vile is a ghoul
around level 30 or so who spawns in the NE part of NK. When you kill Zahal,
Regis will appear at the tree line. He is a zombie. You need to kill him and
loot his corpse to get the ingot and the flute. Take the flute back to Lianna in
the Rathe Mts. and she will give you the Icon. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading642"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Caduceus of Sacrament: (Gavel)</H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>He needs the ingot and icon of
Sacrament and 2 bars of magnetized platinum. The Icon of Sacrament is in
MistMoore, in the back of the graveyard. There is a room through the illusionary
wall that has 4 doors. Opening one of the doors (the only one you can) causes
all 3 of the other doors to open. There are things behind the doors that are
kinda ugly (mid blue to 34). In the center room (these rooms are no more than
closets) on the floor is where the Icon spawns. It is on the floor and looks
like a small doll until it is picked up. The Ingot of Sacrament spawns on a
Giant Darkbone Skeleton In the ruins in Rathe Mountains. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading643"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Chestplate of the Constant: (Gavel)</H3>

Gauntlets of the Ardent: (Blaize)</H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You need the ingot and icon of
Ardent and 1 bar of galvanized platinum. You need to kill Babbin Borrin, a gnome
necromancer in Befallen, to get the ingot. The icon is found at the bottom of a
river in Everfrost (loc 2996, -5711).</FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading645"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Greaves of the Penitent: (Blaize)</H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You need the ingot and icon of
Penitant and 1 bar of magnetized platinum. The ingot of Penitent is found in
Upper Guk at 206, -484 in the right hand water pillar. The icon is held by an
Erudite named Maugrim who resides in Kerra Ridge on the necromancer
Island.</FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading646"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

Lumberyard Inn in Highpass Hold.</FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading648"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Coin of Tash</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is necessary to obtain a high
level enchanter spell. Romar Sunto offers to give you the tashania scroll if you
can find 10 coins in different cities around the world. He will sell you a book
on where to find all 10 coins for 50gp and will give you a pouch to combine them
in. The coins are called an old silver coin, and can be found in the following
places: (1) Ak'anon - Near great wheel (not in water); (2) Kaladim - Pool by
warrior's guild; (3) Erudin - in the pool outside the guilds in the palace; (4)
Qeynos - Under Temple of Life UFO in the Koalindl Fish Pool; (5) Halas - In lake
in front of city to the left of docks on a ledge; (6) Oggok - in lake near
warrior guild at the north end; (7) Grobb - in pool near bar where you first
enter the zone; (8) Neriak - Ouside blind fish window near ice comet rod; (9)
Felwithe - at the edge of the fishing pond; and (10) Freeport - Under the mage
guild building in the water. Take the 10 coins and combine them in the coin
pouch to get a "Coin Of Tash". Next, Take the coin to Tarn Visilin in the
Highkeep Library and give him the coin. He will enchant it into a glowing coin
of tash and give it back. Then take the coin to Mizr N'Mar in Neriak Library and
give him the coin. He enchants it into a gleaming coin of tash. Then take the
coin to Raine Beteria in Erudin Library and give her the coin. It is important
to note that you must have a high faction with her or she will just keep the
coin nd give you nothing in return. Casting Illusion Erudite and Benevolence
before giving her the coin should take care of this problem. Take the coin that
she gives you and return it to Romar and receive the tashania scroll (level 44
enchanter spell), which is no drop, so if you want this spell you have to do
this quest. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020623"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading649"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Darkwood Staff</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Romar Sunto will give you a darkwook
staff, also known as the Staff of Ro, which is useable by all classes, if you
bring him a Lambent Stone from a Hill Giant, a Sand Giant or a Griffin. This is
also used for some other quests. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020624"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading650"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Elemental Power</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Vira will construct four mage items
which, when wielded while summoning the pet of the element the item represents
above level 34 (the level limit seems to not work, and the items seem to affect
the stats of any summoned pet for now), will significantly boost the power the
pet. They are also decent 1HB weapons. You need to fetch him the proper
ingredients to make the item. </FONT><BR></DIV>

Enchanter Incandescent Armor</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Sultin makes various incandescent
items, plus the rod, which are for enchanters. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading656"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Incandescent Gloves: </H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>He needs to sew together four other
sets of gloves to make these. Glowing Gloves from Shadowed Men, Radiant Gloves
from Radiant in the mazes of Cazic Thule and Enchanted and Gleaming gloves. For
Gleaming Gloves you have to give Tarn Vislin in Highkeep a bloodstone he will
then give you Gleaming gloves. Bring 50gp to Tizina of the Lavastorm Gypsies.
She will then hand you the Enchanted Gloves. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading657"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Incandescent Mask: </H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>He needs a Glowing Mask, found on
the skeletal monk in the caverns of Guk (I have also been told you can get one
on the froglock scryer) and all three Runes of Fortune. One Rune can be found on
the Dark Elf Enynti in the Chasm below Castle Mistmoore. The other two can each
be purchased for 50 golden coins each - one from Mizr N&#180;Mar in the Neriak
City Library and the other from Madam Serena in Qeynos. Purchasing the rune from
Mizr N'Marr increases your faction with beta neutral, so this is an easy, but
costly, way to raise this faction. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading658"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Incandescent Wand: </H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>He needs a Pouch of Silver Dust from
the Dusty Werebat in the Estate of Unrest. He also needs a Silver Wand from the
Silvered Guard in Cazic Thule, but asks that you get the wand enchanted before
you bring it to him. Both of the components for this quest are no drop. Once you
find the Silver Wand, take it to Ezmirella in the gypsy camp in North Karana.
Hand her the Silver Wand and 50 gold coins. She will return a Blessed Silver
Wand and instruct you to seek out Raine Beteria in the Erudin Library. Hand
Raine the wand and 50 gold coins to receive the Glowing Silver Wand and the
following faction adjustments: MerchantsofErudin, HighCouncilofErudin,
HighGuardofErudin get better. You must have a good faction for this, so you may
need to use benevolence. Take the Enchanted Silver Wand and Pouch of Silver Dust
back to Sultin. Hand him both and he will give you the Incandescent Wand.
</FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading659"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
Rod of Insidious Glamour: (increases charisma)</H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>He needs a golden rod (from a
froglok priest in guk) and an enchanted shining stone. The enchanted shining
stone is made from a shining stone from shadow men, take that stone to Cynthia,
a gypsie in the rathe mountains and give it and 50gp to get it enchanted. Then
go to Highkeep and get the stone transmuted. The two steps for getting the stone
each raise faction with beta neutral and can be done separately from the rest of
the quest for those who just need a faction boost.

Necromancer Shadowbound Armor</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Syllina will make shadowbound armor
for necromancers. She makes 3 kinds: boots, gloves and a robe. In addition, she
will tell you how to make <I>shadow silk</I> for 50gp. This is made through the
<I>tailoring skill</I>, so you either have to learn tailoring or have to buy it
from a tailor. I keep getting conflicting reports on which sceptor she wants for
which quest. I think that it is set to vary randomly from person to person and
she will ask for a different sceptor each time. Best bet is to ask her first.
The scepters need to be identified to see which one they are, and they seem to
appear in both Mistmoore and Guk. I have also been told that you need to give
her the items in the order she lists them, but can't confirm this.

called "Never Stop Chopping" [5 damage 32 delay no drop lore]. Then, go to the
bar &#8216;Top of the world&#8217; in Highpass. In the back room is Falyn
Farreach. Say to him: &#8221;never stop chopping&#8221;and he replies (this may
be optional, but why not do it) with some plot. Next, go to a bar named the
lumberjack (near the keep) and talk to Bryan on the balcony. Have a top level
space open in your inventory and give him the axe. He will give you a container

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>For the Gem of Rightousness you need
to do the following: Talk to Noresa Sparkle in West Commons. She asks you to
save her from Kiz Gix. She also tells you of a "Gem Case", which you would need
two keys to open, and would have to return both box and keys to the "original
boxcrafter" to find what is inside. Kiz Gix roams around befallen side of WC.
Upon killing him you receive a note written in Goblin, telling you of a Dark Elf
"Outcast" who stole a sparkling purse. You can find the Outcast, who is named
Lynada the Exiled, in Sol A in the High Shaman room. Killing the outcast gets
you the Sparkle Purse. Return the Sparkle Purse to Noresa Sparkle and she gives
you one of the keys needed to open the "Gem Case". Find the Gem Case. It is
hidden behind a locked door in the slums of E. Freeport that you must pick.
(Approx 150 lockpick skill). It is guarded by a dog named Scrapps. Spawn time on
case is unknown -- Gem Case spawn might be broken or has moved/is triggered.
Then, go to the Freeport Sewers and find Toxdil. Ask him about the gems, and
then about the Gem Case. He tells you that he has the key, but will only give it
to you for the gem inside the case. He says he last sold it to a jeweler. Go
back to Noresa and purchase off her a "Sparkling Sapphire" (This gem looks like
the Gem of Stamina/Righteousness and will trick Toxdil.) (Cost Approx 500pp).
Return this Sapphire to Toxdil, and he gives you the other key necessary to open
the Gem Case. Give the Gem Case and both keys to Bubar in the East Commons
Tunnel to receive the Gem of Righteousness. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Return both gems to Ortalious in
South Ro and he will give you the Burning Rapier: 7 damage, 23 delay. Shock of
Fire proc (16DD) +5 dex, +5 agi. no-drop, rogue only. Over the course of the
quest, you will get a decent amount of xp and some platinum.
