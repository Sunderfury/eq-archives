Cheslin's Illusion Cards</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Follow the guard Cheslin around and
pick up his illusion cards for some experience and gold. You will probably have
to keep him from getting killed by the wandering creatures in order to get all
his cards, since he is a total wimp who can get beat up by a rat (or at least a
bear). The cards he drops are Chrono Cyclone, Diamond Vale, Ebon Lotus, and
Library of Erudin. You must give him all 4 cards to get anything. (Or
alternately, there is a collector in Freeport seeking 14 rare Illusion cards,
including the four Cheslin drops - see Freeport quests). After giving back Guard
Cheslin his four illusion cards, he'll give you experience and a bit of cash. He
will also give you a note to his father in South Qeynos named Chesgard (He's
near the Order of Thunder). After you give him the note, he'll thank you and
you'll get a larger amount of experience and a nice item. Giving the cards to
Cheslin results in these faction adjustments: +GuardsofQeynos, +AntoniusBayle,
-CorruptGuards, -CircleofUnseenHands, +MerchantsofQeynos. Taking the note to
Chesgard gives these adjustments: +KnightsofThunder, -BloodSabers,
+PriestsofLife, +GuardsofQeynos </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020545"></A><BR></DIV>

Gnasher's Head</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest starts in Surefall Glade.
Talk to Larsk Juton who has some sort of feud with a gnoll named Gnasher. Too
lazy to do it himself I guess, he wants you to kill his enemy for him. This
gnoll occasionally appears in Qeynos Hills and is around level 10 or so. Kill
him and bring his head back to Lars and you will get some cash and the
Blackburrow Brewers Quest (Surefall). Sometimes when you kill Gnasher Furrgutt,
he is carrying a note from the bartender at Fish's Ale which you can turn in to
the authorities. First, give the note to Larsk Juton (the same person you give
Gnasher's head to). Note that you cannot shortcut this by giving the note to
Captain Tillian directly. He will give you some experience and a faction
adjustment, and advise you to take the note to Captain Tillian in the Arena in
Qeynos (the same one you give Gnoll Fangs to). Captain Tillian will give you
more experience, more faction adjustments, and a Medal of Merit (a Lore Item
which gives you +5 Charisma) for your good deeds. He will then summon the
Executioner, who will proceed to Fish's Ale to carry out the sentence of death
pronounced on the unwise bartender. Follow the executioner and watch the fun.
Another note. If you are carrying gnoll fangs for Captain Tillian, give them to
him and go collect the blackburrow stout first, since the executioner will kill
your stout connection and he won't respawn for a while.

Gnoll Slayer<A NAME="_Toc476020547"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Marton Sayor in the cottage in
Qeynos Hills is concerned about the safety of his infant son. He says he will
give you the gnoll slayer long sword if you help him. Marton mentions a named
gnoll named Lord Elgnub who speaks common tongue, and has threatened his family.
Well, Lord Elgnub can occasionally be found wandering around blackburrow. He
looks like a Splitpaw Gnoll and is approximately level 20. If you kill him you
will get a lore/no drop item Baby Joseph Slayer. Take the baby back to his
father and the grateful man will give you a <I>Gnoll Slayer</I> sword, which is
a 1H slashing, 6/28 lore weapon. Not altogether exciting, but he mentions
something about the true potential of the sword. If you inquire further, he
mentions there was once an enchantment placed upon a gnolls eye which was
embedded in the sword that gave the sword powers to protect against disease and
call forth a wolf to fight for you. (Sounds like the scimitar of the
Mistwalker). He then says this eye has been stolen, along with the only book
that can restore the enchantment and eye to the sword. The thief is a great,
one-eyed, white gnoll. He provides no further information and says he's been
hunting for this gnoll for a long time. I have been told, but cannot confirm,
that a one eyed white gnoll was spotted at the gnoll camp in Lake Rathe. If so,
he must be an extremely rare spawn.</FONT><BR></DIV>

Jaggedpine Crook Staff</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest starts in SureFall
Glades. This quest will not work with too high of a character. Talk with Corum
Finisc, just outside the Jaggedpine of SureFall Glades. After some keywords, he
will mention [crook]. This is a Jaggedpine crook staff that is broken in pieces
in Qeynos Hills. Only Gnoll Hunters have the parts. The gnoll hunters are very
rare and getting the staff pieces is difficult. However, once you have both, go
back to Corum Finisc and he will assemble them for you.

The Millers</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The Miller siblings, Baobob and
Chandra, will make bearhide and wolfhide armor for you if you provide them with
the proper pelt and some gold. Just talk to them and follow their instructions.
Baobob makes the wolfhide armor (Wofskin Belt [AC 3], Wolfskin boots [AC 4] and
<I>Wolfhide Cape</I>) and Chandra makes bearhide armor. Chandra Millers' prices
for bearhide armor are as follows: <I>Bear Hide Belt</I> - 5 GP and Low quality
Bear pelt; <I>Bear Hide Boots</I> - 15 GP and Medium quality bear pelt; <I>Bear
Hide Cape</I> - 21 GP and High quality bear pelt. This also raises faction with
Karana Residents, Guards of Qeynos, Priests of Life and Knights of Thunder. Be
aware that you need to have a high faction with the Karana Residents to get
anything made other than a belt. Buying one of the items also gives you the
following faction adjustments: +KaranaResidents, +GuardsofQeynos,
+PriestsofLife, +KnightsofThunder </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020549"></A><BR></DIV>

Rat Ear Pie</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Rephas is a crazed hermit who lives
near the lake in the Qeynos Hills, with a penchant for rat ears. If you give him
regular rat ears he will grill them for you, and you get a lore item 'Grilled
Rat Ears' which are also edible. Give that back to him and you get a minor item
and some faction and experience. If you give him 3 giant rat ears he will give
you a recipe for Rat Ear Pie which does not require a clump of dough (Giant Rat
Ears + Baking Spirits + Cup of Four in a mixing bowl, then bake result in an
oven). This rat ear pie can then be used in the Paw of Oppola quest. You get the
following faction adjustments for giving him rat ears or giant rat ears: +
Arcane Scientists + Knights of Truth, - Freeport Militia - Opal Darkbriar.

Steel Warrior Initiation</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Go to Brin Stolunger in Warriors
Guild S. Qeynos, tell him you are a [young steel warrior]. He will give you a
ten slot arena sack and tell you to collect 5 bat wings and 5 snake scales and
combine them inside to create a full sack. When you give it back to him, you get
a few copper, xp, faction and a note that you are to take to Axe Broadsmith in
Qeynos Hills. (He's in the hut by the pond) When you give him the note, he will
tell you to kill the [strange skeleton] across the pond. When you kill it, bring
it's skull to him as proof, and you'll get more coppers, xp, faction and a
letter of recommendation to take back to Brin Stolunger. When you return to
Qeynos and give the letter to Brin, you get MORE coins, xp, faction, and another
note. This one you take downstairs to the animal pits below the arena, and give
it to Grahan Rothkar who tells you it's time for your Final Test. He will give
you a key to open one of the animal pens so you can enter and fight a young
lion. When you kill the young lion, bring it's pelt and meat to Grahan and
you'll get MORE copper, xp, faction and TADA... Strongbear Bracers. They're
magical, AC 1, Agil +1, warrior only, any race. And he welcomes you to the Steel
Warriors! </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020551"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading552"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Talym Shoontar's Head</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You must remove the head of the
master poacher Talym Shoontar from his shoulders and return it to your guild.
This quest can be started either when the guy you turn in the regular poachers
head to mentions him (after turning in a poachers head), or directly started by
talking to Hagar Sureshot in Surefall Glade. Talym appears in Qeynos Hills,
somewhere between the cottage, the road marker, and the Guard Tower. He appears
by the WK zone border and heads down the road towards Qeynos. He is about lvl
15, and is roughly on par with Dorn B'Dynn, the scourge of the Northern Desert
of Ro. Plus, if you attack him in Qeynos Hills, the guards will attack you. For
a safer way to kill him, Shoontar also occasionally appears in Fish Tavern's
back room, where you turn in the moonstones for gnoll stouts. This may only
happen after the executioner appears following the gnasher's head quest. Another
person spotted Shoontar in Freeport at the docks, so he obviously gets around.
You get money, experience and an item.

<A NAME="Heading553"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Taxes</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(All Classes) Somewhere in South
Queynos you will find on the 2nd floor of a building a man with a bad cough.
After talking to him for a bit, he will tell you that he is a tax collecter and
needs you to make his runs for him. He will give you a box, in which to place
and combine the taxes, and a scroll with the names of the people. To get the
taxes from the, simply hail them and say "Please pay your taxes." Doing this
will give you a very small lowering of faction with Qeynos merchants. Upon going
to Mira Sayer, In Qeynos Hills, and asking her to pay, she will begin to cry.
When you ask her why she is crying, she will tell you a halfling named Flynn
something or other stole her tax money. He is in Crow's Pub in Qeynos. Go to
him, hail him, and ask him if he stole Mira's tax money. He will affirm this,
and tell you to say "I am a gnoll loving weakling and am not worthy to comb your
feet" &lt;grin&gt; After doing so, he will shout it, and the entire zone will
here what an idiot you are. He'll give you the money, combine it, and give it to
the tax man. You'll get a couple silver, a silver stud, and a <I>Brass Ring</I>.
A tip for those of you who need an extra way to hold items. If you keep the tax
collection box, you will have a 10 slot box to hold items, and you can get this
as low as level 1. Not bad. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020553"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading554"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Undead</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There is a guy by the south wall of
the zone named Niclaus Ressin. He says he was sent by Priestess Jahnda to
investigate reports of the undead in QH. If you ask him 'have you seen any
undead' he will talk about the undead ruins and pulling a torn parchment from a
dead body. If you ask him about the torn parchment, he will give it to you and
ask that you go to qeynos and give it to someone who can decipher it.

<A NAME="Heading555"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Varzoom the Undying</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Varsoon of Qeynos Aquaducts and
Qeynos Hills is a high level necromancer, and the target of many high-level
players. In QH, he sometimes spawns in the ruins near Surefall. He is about
level 23. Immediately after you kill Varsoon, a Varsoon Zombie will spawn in the
same ruins, who will run in a straight line for the nearest de-spawning site (so
the zombie stays in the zone for less than a minute). The zombie is called
Varsoon the Undying and is probably around level 33 or so, casts high level
necro spells and is hard to kill, especially considering you would have just
finished a battle with Varsoon. Kill him and you get a golden ear stud (+3 int).
