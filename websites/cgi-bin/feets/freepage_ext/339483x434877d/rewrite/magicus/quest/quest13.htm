Ale for Beur</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Beur Tenlah stands in the tunnels
not far from the tavern by the dock. He is thirsty, but too lazy to go all the
way up to the tavern for his favorite dwarven brew. Go buy him a Dwarven Ale and
you will gain some experience, faction and his thanks, as well as a new quest
from his pal Harkin. Note: If you are an evil race the Ogre in the bar will kill
anyone evil who walks into the bar to buy the ale. So you need to buy it
elsewhere before you go to Freeport. This quest no longer raises faction with
the Freeport Militia. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020206"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading95"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Bayle List</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This a long and involved quest, and
can be started in a number of different places, but revolves around Qeynos,
Surefall and Freeport. The details I was given are still unclear in spots, but
it ultimately resluts in a high powered shadowknight weapon. It involves getting
all three parts of the Bayle List. Each part can also be gotten separately for a
different reward, as listed on the separate quests. (1) For Part one of the
list, talk to Commander Kane in the Shrine of Bertoxxus in Qeynos Catecombs and
he will ask you to deliver blackburrow stout to Barn Bloodstone who is outside
the Golden Rooster in Highpass. Make sure your faction withBarn is at least
indifferent. To raise, do the Letter to Janam/Letter to Rebby quests in the East
FP. If Commander Kane doesn't talk to you at first, just Hail him and say "The
disease is spreading." Then he will bemuch more manageable. Doing so results in
part one of the list. (2) For part two of the list, you need to kill a bear. As
background, you can talk to Runethar Hamest in the Temple of Thunder, who is
investigating corruption among the guards of Qeynos. He asks you to go to
Surefall Glade, find Frenway Marthank in the Druids' Guildtree, and ask him for
"The Bayle List." When you do, Frenway is in a state of depression. His son --
who happened to be carrying the very list you're looking for -- was killed and
devoured by the great grizzly bear Mammoth, who lives deep in the caves of
Surefall Glade. As a Druid, Frenway is forbidden to harm the bears of the Glade,
but he wants vengeance. If you can find and slay Mammoth, you will get a the
Bayle list II. Basically, all you have to do is kill the bear (he is about level
20) and skip the rest. (3) For part three, talk to Raltur Caliskon in the Dismal
Rage in Freeport and he tells you to assist Sir Lucen Delere in any task he has.
But to return any interesting information to him and not Delere. Ralture will
then tell you to kill Lady Shea and get the Bayle List. However, Lady Shea will
tell you that she had the list stolen from her by Dyllin Starshine, who is bound
for Qeynos. He can be found in the smuggler's camp in Highpass. If you have a
high faction or use your influence spell on him, he will give you the list. You
can also get it by killing him, but you will take a bad faction hit from that
that might cause you to not be able to complete the final part of the quest. (4)
Take all three parts to Rathmana Allin in South Ro along with 20 gp and he will
give you back a translated list. If you give this to Pietro Zarn, the
shadowknight guildmaster in the East Freeport Sewers, he will usually reward you
with a <I>Rage War Maul</I> (you may need very high faction with him to get it -
thus you shouldn't kill Dyllin unless you started extremely high). It is
possible that this is used to obtain an even better shadowknight weapon.

The Burning Dead</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This ultimately leads to the
creation of the <I>Wand of the Burning Dead</I>. My details are stilll sketchy.
Talk to Opal Darkbriar in the Freeport tunnels and ask her about the wand. She
needs three things to help assemble the broken wand. The first is Marnek's Wand,
which can be found in the bottom level of Befallen. The second is the Sapphire
of Souls, which can be found in Najena. I am not sure what the third is. Bring
these to Opal and you should get the wand. You need a very high faction to get
this quest. (Submitted by Jerrod Jer'Odus)

Corrupt Guards (Paladin version)</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The guards in Freeport are corrupt
and the Paladin's Guild wants you to do something about it. Kill the guards and
return their helmets to the paladin guildmaster one at a time for some decent
money, experience and a faction adjustment. Beware that this quest will make you
very unpopular among the guards as your faction will go up with the Knights of
Truth and down with the Freeport Militia.
</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020209"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading98"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Corrupt Guards (Cleric version)</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The Clerics Guild also has a beef
with the corrupt Freeport Militia. Jernoz Lerkarson wants you to return damaged
militia helms to him. If your faction is high enough, after returning the helm,
he will tell you to build up your strength so that you can destroy the [true
organizer]. If you ask him who the true organizer is, he will tell you that it
is Captain Hazran, and ask you to slay him and bring him his head. If you can
manage to get a group together and kill Hazran and return his head to Jernoz,
you will recieve a random spell scroll, a minor reward considering how hard it
is to kill him. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020210"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading99"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Deathfist Slashed Belts</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There are 2 people who pay bounties
on the belts. One is Captain Hazran of the militia, and he is located on the
outside balcony of the militia HQ building. Giving him two belts causes you to
gain faction with the militia, and lose faction with the paladin, warrior, and I
think cleric guilds. You can also bring belts to Cain Darkmoor, who is located
in the banquet room on the 2nd floor of the warrior guildhall. He now wants two
belts at a time. When you give him two belts, you gain faction with the warriors
and paladins, and you lose it with the militia. You also get 2 - 10 gp and some
decent xp. Also, when you give Cain a belt, he'll thank and ask you for help
with his "bigger problem." Asking about this sends you to the paladin guild
where you learn about the Corrupt Guards quest.

<A NAME="Heading100"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Death of Lyda Nasin</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>It is possible that you have to
complete the message intercept quest first to get his quest. The guild master of
the Ebon Masks in Neriak sends you to freeport to speak to the same dark elf who
spawns at night down by the docks. She gives you a mission to kill Lyda Nasin,
the daughter of the Owner of the Seafarers Roost. She spawns on the second floor
of the Seafarers in the morning, however Dark elves are KOS if they enter the
bar (with the new ability to move and stay hidden perhaps the thieves can now
complete this one...) In any case an easier way to kill her is to hire someone
to go upstairs and tell her that a ship has docked. She will come outside to the
pier where she can be killed. You get faction, some cash, and a minor item.

<A NAME="Heading101"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Exotic Drinks</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is probably the best
quest in the game for a lower level magic user, especially an enchanter. In
fact, with the new changes, only an enchanter (or perhaps a very careful dark
elf) can really do the whole thing. It results in the Stein of Moggok, a great
magic item which gives +10 int, +5 dex, +10 hp, +25 disease resistance, has two
charges of healing and acts as a greater light source. The items can be
collected by just about anyone, but you need to to be an enchanter to finish the
quest. I know the quest works every time with a level 20 enchanter who has
illusion ogre and benevolence. It also can work in some instances with a level
12 enchanter who has illusion dark elf and alliance. It is a lengthy quest,
requiring you to go all over the world to get items, but worth it. Clurg, the
Ogre bartender in Ogguk, has lost his bartender's compendium and wants it back
badly. It is currently held by Bartender Gregor, in Freeport. Fortunately,
Gregor has a lust for exotic drinks, and lacks only the ingredients to make his
dream concoctions. He will give you the compendium for those ingredients. He
wants you to get him the following items: (1) a Kiola Nut, which can be
purchased on the island of Erollisi for about 2 gp, (2) Erud's Tonic [now a no
drop lore item] (see Erudin quests, basically a quick purchase and exchange),
(3) Honey Jum from Rivervale (See Rivervale Quests - the price is now 30 gold)
[note: You need an indifferent faction in Rivervale for this one or you need to
trust a halfling to get it for you. If you can't find a trustworthy halfling, (I
had the misfortune of initially getting ripped off by a particularly nasty
halfling named Mappas who believed he could extort 5 pp for the honey jum after
I gave him the items and a promise of 5 gp to get it [back when it only cost 5
gp for the item]) you can easily create one of your own and do the exchange
since a level 1 can easily do this part of the quest], and (4) a Koalindl Fish
from the lake in the Temple of Life in Qeynos [now a no drop lore item]. This is
the hardest and most costly part of the quest. You will take a severe faction
hit with several good factions and with Rodcet Nife himself for killing the
fish, dropping several levels in faction, and you will get attacked and killed
when you leave the water unless you gate in time. (There is also a paladin who
will jump in and kill you in the water if he is nearby). The fish do not drop a
corpse every time, so you may have to kill several fish, potentially making you
kos with many clerics afterwards. Also, they are a slow spawn and are currently
being camped quite a bit. I don't know if this will work, but it might be
possible for two people to do this with one creating a mule to kill the fish and
take the faction hit, while the enchanter who will complete the quests loots it
and gets the item. As another alternative, Frostbite the Dog in WK sometimes
drops a Koalindl fish if his master is not around, but you lose some serious
faction for this as well and one of the people you lose faction with happens to
spend a lot of time in Gregor's bar, making it tough to complete the quest if
you become kos with her. Although the resulting drink sounds pretty foul to me,
should you manage to gather all of these ingredients he promises to give you his
bartender's compendium. The enchanter must give Gregor the ingredients. I have
been told that some people have had the quest fail by giving him all of the
items at once (it will say he only got one) and others have had no trouble. I
would suggest to be safe that you give them to him one at a time. Gregor will
then give him 3 to 4 pp and the bartender's compendium, which is a no drop item.
This has to be taken to Ogguk and given to Clurg the bartender there. Be aware
that even under an illusion some ogres might attack you, so it might help to go
invisible. Before giving it to Clurg, the enchanter needs to cast illusion ogre
and benevolence. Or as an alternative, cast illusion dark elf and alliance (this
lets it be done by a lower level enchanter, but does not seem to work every
time). If his or her faction is not good enough, it won't work (I have had
reports that indifferent has worked for some people and not worked for others,
but that is probably the minimum he should con). Clurg will then give you the
stein. I would say, assuming you can get sow when needed, you can do this quest
in just about 3 hours (less if you have teleports).

Frikniller Family</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you ask Gren Frikniller, a
bodyguard for the rogue guildmaster in East Freeport, who his sister is, he will
tell you that it is Falia Frikniller, who is in North Freeport. He will give you
a letter to take to her. When you give this letter to Falia in North Freeport,
she will say thanks and give you a broken heirloom that she asks you to take
back to Gren. She also gives you some faction, a little experience and a few
coppers. When you give the heirloom to Gren, he just gives you some faction and
a little experience, since he says the heirloom isn't worth anything anyways.
Giving the letter from Gren to Falia gives no faction adjustment, while
returning the heirloom from Falia to Gren gives faction increase for the follow:
CoalitionofTradefolk, CoalitionofTradefolkIII, CarsonMcCabe,
CorruptQeynosGuards, TheFreeportMilitia.

Groflah Steadirt's Death</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Netuk Phenzon at the shadowknight's
guild says that Lord Innoruuk has need of your services. Your [mission] concerns
a man named Groflah Steadirt. Groflah has come into possession of a piece of
parchment that was taken from one of the Dismal Rage's allies (whose identity is
not your concern). You are instructed to find Groflah and kill him, while
returning the note to Netuk. Doing this will improve your standing with the
Dismal Rage and Opal Darkbriar and lower it with the Knights of Truth. As a side
note, it's interesting to see that Verant has staged two totally opposite
classes with opposing quests. You can't kill him while he is in his shop in
North Freeport, or his corpse will disappear. Since he is a merchant at the
time, he won't leave a corpse. You have to wait until he goes to the inn at the
dock's in East Freeport. You can kill him there and loot the note from his
corpse, and return it and receive a random item as a reward.

Hogcaller's Inn</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In the warrior's guild, you are
given a quest to investigate the Hogcaller's Inn. Apparently, someone is leaking
information to the dark elves concerning the city defenses. Your contact is on
the second floor. Tell her who sent you and she will give you some information
and ask for a glass of wine. Give her the wine and she will give you the key
phrase you must use with the innkeeper, something like I need mail for the 2nd
room. He will ask you to prove it is your room by showing him the key. If you
enter the middle room on the right on the second floor you may see Shintl
Lowbrow. If she is there, wait for her to leave. She sometimes will pick up the
key, in which case you have to kill her to get it. If she isn't there, look on
the floor at the back left by the bureau for the key. Give the key to the
innkeeper and he will give you the mail. Take the mail to the person who gave
you the quest. She will tell you to take it to Toala, who is located on the top
floor of the arena. Toala will then tell you to kill Shintl Lowbrow and her drow
helper. She will give you a box in which you put both heads and combine. If you
kill Shintl, you get a head. Her drow helper may be Hollis Tnoops, who is
located in Wrest Freeport and drops a dark elf head (this may not be the head
you need - I have received comnflicting reports on this -- as a side note I
believe there is also a dark elf in OOT who drops a head). Put both of these
heads in the box and combine them and return them for a reward. I was not told
what the reward was. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020217"></A><BR></DIV>

Hopeless Love</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Lagus Pladeson of the Steel Warriors
in Freeport (he can be found in the courtyard behind the Steel Warriors
building) talks to you about his hopeless love affairs with both [Milea] and
[Toala]. When you ask him about Milea, he tells you about Milea Clothspinner,
how he loved her, and how she left, and that he does not know where she is,
maybe for the best. There are no keywords in brackets here. Tell him: "Milea is
in East Karana". This will start him talking again, and he will give you a
letter to bring to her. Milea Clothspinner can be found at the end of the gorge
that runs next to the ramp to Highhold in East Karana. When you give her the
letter she is not pleased at all, since he is apparently of the harassing type,
and she calls him "the plague". She will give you a random item and some coins.

Illusion Cards</H2>

tried to complete this quest. In fact it may no longer be in the game, since
nobody can seem to find this NPC anymore (I'm not sure of his name). There is a
collector in Freeport seeking 14 rare Illusion cards. What he will give for
these cards in uncertain. To check if a card is truly an illusion card, cast
identify on it. Also, the cards have similar names to Magic the Gathering cards.
So far I have only verified 4 of cards. They are: 1)Chrono Cyclone, 2)Ebon
Lotus, 3)Diamond Vale, 4)Library of Erudin (all four dropped by Cheslin in
Qeynos Hills) There are two others I 'm not sure of: Silver (from steamfont) and
Oracle (loot in Crushbone). The playing cards dealt by various NPC's (king,
queen, jack, knight, joker) are not illusion cards.

Lenka's Pouch</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You get this quest by talking to
Toala in the arena. She will send you to see her friend on the docks named Lenka
Stoutheart. She says that a rogue stole a pouch off her boat that has a voucher
ticket for a part she needs to complete a repair to the boat. Her bodyguard
gives you a description of the thief, which seems to match an NPC fisherman
named Brunar Rankin. Brunar will deny being the villain and killing him does not
get the pouch. If you stay with Brunar he eventually goes up into the Seafarers
Roost and gives his 'Catch" to Gregor the bartender. If asked about Brunar,
Gregor hints that he steals for him. Gregor says he will put the catch down in
the storeroom, which by the way leads down to the Thieves guild. The pouch can
be found between a box and a crate in the storage room with the secret door to
the thieves guild. Take the pouch to Lenka and she says this and that about the
stuff was stolen and tells you that you can have the junk in the pouch. I have
been told of someone getting a snapped fishing pole, which he gave to the lady
on the docks near where the boat comes for faction and some money. Another
person said they got a Moggok's right eye. The faction hits for returning the
pouch are: +WolvesoftheNorth, +ShamanofJustice, +MerchantsofHalas,
-RoguesoftheWhiteRose, +SteelWarriors. For returning the fishing rod to Olunea
Miltin, you get the rod back and these faction hits: +TheFreeportMilitia,

The Lottery Ticket</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In East Freeport go into Hallard's
Resales (located in the "bad" part of E Freeport behind the import store) and
talk to Tohsan Hallard. He will tell you about his special deal - bring him 4
orc pawn picks (dropped by those pesky Deathfist Pawns in West Freeport and the
Commonlands) and he will give you 5sp and a Highpass Hold Lottery Ticket. If you
give him 4 orc pawn picks (not stacked) he gives you a few silver and a Highpass
Hold Lottery Ticket (NO DROP and LORE ITEM), which he tells you is a non-winning
ticket from last year's lottery. You get the following faction changes for
turning in the picks: Coalition of Tradesfolk, Knights of Truth, Merchants of
Qeynos and Coalition of Tradesfolk III all go up, and no factions go down. Take
your new lottery ticket to Highkeep to the basement near the bank. Apparantly,
you randomly get different tickets each time you do this. Go talk to the person
near the bank (not the banker) about something like the "highkeep lottery" and
he will send you to talk to Casino Treasurer Lynn who is nearby. The treasurer
says that last year's winner never came forward, but gives the winning ticket
number and says something about it being a person from Freeport. Some tickets
get you nothing, some are a "runner-up" and gets you a few coins and tiny amount
of XP. If the winning number that he gives you is on one of the tickets, you get
the key to the Royal Suite on the 3rd floor, a nodrop lore item. There is a
locked door on the third floor, opened it with a key, and where you will find a
skeleton named "Tearon Bleanix" who responds to questions about "Princess
Lenya". It may be that this is the new quest for the <I>Thex Dagger</I> since
the old one doesn't seem to function any more, although the beginnings of this
quest were around before the patch that nerfed the dagger quest.

Skemner at the top floor of the arcane science building wants to teach an
apprentice named Lydl Mastat a lesson. You are supposed to find Lydl and kill
him and return the locked book that he carries. He can sometimes be found
outside the South Gate to the newbie zone of East Freeport near a couple of
cacti. His is approximately level 5, but has a spell that makes him invulnerable
to nonmagic weapons, so need to be killed with magic. Killing Lydl Mastat
results in these faction adjustments: DismalRage and OpalDarkBriar get worse,
KnightsofTruth gets better. You receive these faction adjustments when returning
the book: ArcaneScientists and KnightsofTruth get better; OpalDarkBriar and
TheFreeportMilitia get worse. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020224"></A><BR></DIV>

Marr Minnows for Palon</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Palon Deskeb, one of the wizard
guildmasters, wishes that the pond under the guild had some Marr minnows in it.
He will give you a jar to fill with the minnows and bring back to him. The quest
has a bug - he tells you about [Marr Minnows], but you need to ask him "What is
a Marr Minnow?" singular instead of plural. Go to the exterior of the Hall of
Truth. To the left side is a river, with minnows and piranha in it. When you
give the jar to the minnow you get a message about the knights not liking people
stealing the minnow, and the following faction adjustments: Freeport Militia and
Coalition of Trades Folk gets better, Knights of Truth and Priests of Marr gets
worse. You must keep giving the 'Jar of Liquid' to minnows until the jar turns
into a Jar of Fish. Then give the Jar of Fish back to the wizard. You will get a
whole ration for your trouble. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020225"></A><BR></DIV>

unfortunately, the knight is afraid that the agent's position has been
compromised. She wants you to take a letter of warning to him. You need to find
the correct sentry. The sentry is one of the ones in the militia training house.
Speak a code word to him and give him the note. He will give you another note
back to take back to the hall of truth, as well as faction and xp. When this
happens 2 guards run up and attack him. They won't bother you unless you try to
help. I don't know what happens if you save him.

Message Intercept</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Raltur Calikson in the shadowknights
guild asks you to [serve] your Lord, Innoruuk. He explains that much like the
Dark Elves of Neriak use trolls and ogres as pawns,so does the Dismal Rage (the
shadowknight guild) use the Freeport Militia. Raltur wants you to report to Sir
Lucan D'Leer himself (found in the main militia building by the western gates),
and tell him that you [are from the Shrine of Innoruuk]. You are instructed to
do whatever Sir Lucan asks, because after all, little favors lead to large
debts. Most importantly, if you find something important, you are to bring it to
him, not Sir Lucan. Talking to Sir Lucan reveals a different attitude as he
berates the Dismal Rage for being slow to send an agent. He even threatens to
have them broken up and jailed. Finally he tells you that his guards have
reported that there is a messenger from Qeynos staying at an Inn on the western
edge of the Commonlands. You are to go and intercept this message. In fact you
must kill Mojax Hikspin, who is sitting on the south ridge of the lake in the
western Commonlands. He has the message that was meant for the Knights of Truth.
It is possible that there are two separate messages, which yeild different
results when returned. I am not certain of this though. If you bring this
message to Raltur Calikson in the Shadow Knights guild he will give you a first
level spell (other than faction and exp adjustment) and he will give you another
quest to kill the traitor (see traitor quest below). I have also been told that
you may get a quest to kill Lady Shae and recover something called the Bayle
List, but don't know the details of this. The faction for completing the quest
is as follows: Freeport Militia - Better, Coalition of Trade Folk III - Better,
Knights of Truth - Worse, Priest of Marr - Worse.

and a bunch of otherwise illegible writing. If you take it back to the knight
who gave you the message to agent quest, she will give you xp and a faction

"Where did you get these muffins?" If you tell him "I got the muffins from the

will talk to you. Lady Shae is her name and as soon as she finds out that you
are not a noble she'll ask you to buy her a drink. Buy her a couple bottles of
red wine and she'll tell you that a list she was holding for her "Dear sweet

Freeport in a very seedy part of town. You hail him and tell that Danaria sent
you for the painting. He says you are waisting your time and all he wants is
Captain. Captain is a drink that you buy from the vendor there. (Captain Jack?)
After giving him 4 he tells you he needs a boat beacon mount. He tells you to go
see the gnomes about getting it. The Gnomes he refers to are the two brothers
Svinal and Lystyn Wyspin who run 'The Emporium' store next to the bank in North
Freeport. The gnomes will tell you basically you will need good skill in
Smithing (About 70+) and several items. Take the Boat Beacon Mount, a Greater
Lightstone, a Metal Disk, and a Copper Band and combine them in a forge. The
Metal Disk and Copper Band are sold by the Gnomes. When combined you get a

it. It is a Lantern that casts light like a Greater Lightstone. If you take the

some interest in it. If you take the beacon to her, she will give you the
painting (no drop lore item). If you bring the painting back to Palatos, he will
give you a couple of plat for it and the following faction: Heretics down,

usually sitting next to the fisherman on the lake - the one that won't talk or
sell to you. He needs a flask of milk, which you can get from the office of the
people or at Greenleaf's in Freeport. As soon as you give him the milk, he
starts to hand you a note, but a fast NPC named Duggin Scumper comes by, insults
the Freeport king or something, and runs off, yelling that You'll never catch
him, and that he's taking this to his superior in the Quenos Royal hall or
something. In order to get the note, you have to attack the man, kill him (he's
around level 3 or 4) and loot his corpse to find the note. Then you return the
note to Eeyana Neastra, a sentry on the top level of the temple of Marr (she may
be in the Hall of Truth now). He is very tough to catch without magic. However,
sometimes if you stop chasing him and return to Mojax, he will walk down the
path to a pillar and drop the note for you there. Each time you give Mojax milk,
you restart the sequence so that you can try again if you mis the first time.
You get a little gold, a item (sometimes a potion), experience, and the
following faction changes: For giving Mojax Hikspin a bottle of milk -
PriestsofMarr, SteelWarriors, KnightsofTruth go up; DismalRage and FPMilitia go
down. For killing Duggin Scumper (thus retrieving the note) - KnightsofTruth and

there is an undead island (rough loc of -604.96, -7343.81). The island is
populated by a few greater skeletons, a couple gargoyles, and four specters.
There you will find stranded a female paladin named Sentry Xyrin. She mentions
that she was part of a [boat disaster] and that she is from the temple of Marr
in Freeport. She will ask you to get her a [Potion of Marr] from Serna Tasknon
is the Temple of Marr in Freeport. With the potion she will be able to regain
her strength and take on the undead. (You can also initiate this quest by first
speaking to someone in the Temple of Marr, getting the potion, and from that
point on learning of Sentry Xyrinn's location and going to look for her, which
is actually the way most people would discover the quest). You have to get the
bottle from the Temple of Marr and then bring the bottle to all the 8 guards in
alphabetical order. The guards and the order are as follows: ANDLIN (Walks
around outside wall); BORIS (Downstairs stationary); GALLIUS (Outside by front
door); JANEAL (Downstairs stationary); MEIGHAN (Outside by front door); THEO
(Patrols inside on upper levels); WARREN (Patrols inside on lower levels);
XYRINN (final sentry in OoT). It seems that if your faction is not high enough
you can't get the bottle. When you give it to the last person (not including
Xyrinn) he will tell you that she went to the Sisterhood of Erolisi. The sisters
will tell you she is either dead or stranded on a nearby island. Then go to the
island where she is stranded and give the bottle to her. She will give it back
to you to take back to the temple, after which you will be done. I have been
told that if you kill all of the spectres and other undead that he was going to
kill and then give him the potion, he will stand there for a while and then drop
the <I>Deepwater Harpoon</I>. I cannot confirm this.

Test of Truth</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>I am told this is now given to
people after level 9. Because it is an important Paladin quest, I have left in
the various shortcuts people have sent in so you can try various ways to get it
done. This quest is given by Merko, in the Hall of Truth. The first thing Merko
asks you for is to help Altunic Jartin in the E. Commons. Take him the letter,
and he will ask you to help him with a thief named Squire Narl. See the Squire
Narl quest in E Commonlands. (basically you need to buy him a cloth tunic - you
can do this after level 9 even if he doesn't ask for it and still get the
token). This will get you a token of generosity. After you give him the token,
Merko will ask you to get him a spider venom sack. Give him one and you will get
a token of bravery along with some experience anf faction (again, even if he
won't talk to you after level 9, if you give him the venom sack he should still
give you the token). He will then tell you to give him both if you want to go
further on. Give him both tokens and he will ask you to take the test of truth,
which is killing the guard that appears in the sewers (again after level 9 he
might not ask this, but the guard will still spawn). The guard is actually a
female militia spy. Kill her quickly or she will run to the zone and be gone. If
you kill her and take the token she has to Merko, you will recive the Testimony
of Truth Scroll, proclaiming you are a Knight of Truth. This scroll is needed
for the Soulfire quest, but is a no drop item, so you will have to carry it
around with you for quite a while. Throughout this quest, you will recieve many
good faction hits for the Knights of Truth, and the Clerics of Erolissi and a
lot of negative hits for the militia. Most people are KOS to the militia after
killing the spy, so be aware of the consequenses of your actions.

The Treant Fist</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In the guild house of the Ashen
Order, Puab Closk has a task for you. He is located in the top of the guild
house. Ask him "what are treant fist" and he will respond that he has these
items, and will gift them to any "monk of great skill". Tell him that "I am a
monk of great skill" and he will give you Puabs Token and tell you to travel to
the Isle of Kerra to assist an old student of his, a Kerran Cat-man named
Clawfist who has been banished by his people. The trip to Kerra is long, and
once you get there you have to find Clawfist. He is on the island off the docks,
surrounded by erudite necromancer heretics and is known as a "banished kerran".
You can find him at the bottom of the pit on this island. Tell him "puab sent
me", and he will ask for proof. Give him Puabs Token and he will recognise you
as a monk sent by Puab, and will give you a "box with paw prints" a 4 slot
combine box and will ask you to find the remains of his fellow student who fell
fighting goblins somewhere. That somewhere is Runnyeye, and the 4 items can be
found in the area. The first is a ribcage, which may be found on a goblin
alchemist that spawns in Misty Thicket. The spawn rate varies: he has been
hunted for 6 hours and never appeared, and then popped up twice in an hour on
another day. The camp he spawns at is the southern goblin camp from the entrance
to Runnyeye, and the placeholder spawn seems to be Mooto. The second is a
humurous handled mace, found on a goblin alchemist in the Gorge of King Xorbb.
The spawn point is directly outside the entrance to Runnyeye, and the
placeholders seem to be the two goblins stationed by the Runnyeye entrance. This
spawn rate also varies, and can be as long as 8 to 10 hours. These are the easy
but frustrating two to get. Both goblin alchemists seem to be about 18-19th
level, and while they can be hard to find typically once found go down pretty
easily. The next two are a lot harder to get to, and both can be found in
Runnyeye proper. The cat skull cap is on a geletanious cube, and the fractured
femur is found on the goblin captain who spawns out the back of the throne-room.
Both of these seem to be common spawns, so you don't usually have to camp them
for long, but of course getting to them really takes a good party in the 25s or
higher. The captain is about 25th level, and the cube about 20th. Once you have
all 4 items, place them in the paw print box and combine. You'll be rewarded
with a box of cat bones. Take this back to Kerra and Clawfist, give it to him
and he'll reward you with + faction Beta-neutral, a healthy dose of xp, and a
note to take back to Puab. Travel across the continent to Freeport, give Puab
the note and he will reward you with + faction SilentFist, AshenOrder and [one
other that I can't remember], another healthy dose of xp, and the <I>treant
fist</I> gloves, a rather spiffy looking set of monk only gloves. These show up
as black gloves on a monk character.

Weapon Delivery</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a fairly easy quest to do at
Larn Brugal at the Steel Warriors HQ is expecting a shipment of weapons from
Groflah's forge in North Freeport. He will give you a voucher to take to Groflah
for him. Groflah tells you that the Commonland orcs (Deathfist) have killed the
delivery person and taken the 4 blades. There are four of them and they are all
called "<I>Raw Short Sword</I>", just with different numbers. You should be able
to find the first three laying on the ground in the eastern tents of the orc
camp in East Commonlands. The fourth one is occasionally found on the Orc
Weaponsmith who spawns there. Return all four to Larn Brugal, who gives you a
"<I>Reward Raw Shortsword</I>". Take that to Groflah and he will sharpen it and
give you <I>Groflah's Stoutbite</I>.

Xelha's Spiderling Silk</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a very easy quest. Go find
Xelha Nevagon and start a conversation. She will tell you to bring her 2 eyes of
fire beetles, some skeleton bones and 4 spiderling webs. When you give her to 2
fire beetle eyes, she asks if the beetle had 2 eyes, as if you only gave her 1
eye, and she tells you to get more. Turns out she really wants four eyes. She
also wants 4 bone chips for some xp, faction and money. When you give her the 4
spiderling silks, she gives you another quest. You will get Experience Points,
Money and another quest. Every time you give her something youget the following
faction: Dismal Rage - Better, Knights of Truth - Worse, Opal Darkbriar -
Better. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020253"></A><BR></DIV>

Zimel's Blades</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest for the Paladin
Sword <I>Soulfire</I>. I have included the details of the beginning part that
anyone can do, but left out the names of the final NPC's you need to kill. Be
aware that you cannot complete this quest and get Soulfire unless you have a
party of adventurers well into their 40's. After completing the messenger quest,
you take the Zimel's Blades price list back to Kalatrina Plossen in the Hall of
Truth. She then transcribes a little of the note, and determines that it seems
to be some sort of price list. She then sends you to speak with Rashinda (last
name of Elore) at the Freeport Office of the People, but tells you to report
back to her what Rashinda tells you has happened to Zimel's Blades. Once at the
Office of the People, Rashinda will spill her guts if she is asked, "Have you
heard of Zimel's Blades?". She then goes in to detail about the owner being
[Ariska Zimel], and that Zimel's Blades was condemned after Zimel's
disappearance. Zimel's Blades was a weapons shop in East Freeport which was
condemned by the city. She mentions that Groflah Steadirt bought most of the
scraps that were left of Zimel's Blades. Obviously the next question is to ask
Rashinda about Ariska Zimel (a simple "Who was Ariska Zimel?" suffices). She
then goes in to the fact that Ariska Zimel was an extraordinary blacksmith who
also was a great adventurer. She says that he and Groflah Steadirt were best
friends and adventured together until each of them settled in Freeport. She then
mentions Zimel's disappearance again, and says that you should go speak to
Groflah, because he could give you more information about Zimel then she can.
Somewhere in this mess of conversation, after she mentions Zimel, and you ask
her about him, she mentions Steadirt again. This is the time to ask her about
Groflah Steadirt, and again, a simple "Who is Groflah Steadirt?" will suffice.
Okay, so now that you have all of this information, you're supposed to return to
Kalatrina Plossen at the Hall of Truth and tell her that "Zimel's Blades was
condemed". Where upon she wonders why Lucan would visit a condemned building.
She figures he must be searching for something, and mentions that when she last
visited the local forge (must be Groflah's, but she doesn't say that) she heard
rumors of Lucan searching for a sword named Soulfire. She then says if that is
true, then you must find it first, as no more power must go Lucan's way. She
then say's "Seek this sword out." Don't give her the price list, because she
won't give it back and you need it to continue. The purpose of the price list is
to get Groflah to open up to you, instead of telling you that he's never heard
of Zimel's Blades and to go away, because he's busy and can't speak there. His
response after receiving the price list is, and I quote: " Where did you find
this? This was the main price list of Zimel's Blades, but it should be all burnt
up. I was at Zimel's right after the fire and I did not see it hanging where it
should have been. The entire inside was gutted and.... Wait.... The sequence of
the dots!!! Hmmm. I cannot talk with you here. Meet me at the Seafarers by the
docks at night. Give me the note when next we meet." End quote. To get Groflah
to talk you have to be in a certain tavern in East Freeport around 5 or 6am. He
will appear and wag his tongue freely (presumably from the liquor). He'll tell
you about Tumpy Tonics (apparently all dwarves are lushes) and will talk about
Zimel, relating the story about what it was that Zimel found, why he disappeared
and who the culprit is. You must then talk to the beggar Tykar Renlin, who shows
up at the Seafarer's roost. You need to give him 4 droms champagnes, one at a
time, to get him to talk. He will talk to you and give you a blanket. It turns
out that Zimel is being held prisoner down below the arena (I think it may be
cell block number 4). When you talk to Zimel, he says something that ends with
"bog n goo". When you give him edible goo (from cooking), he then says " bog n
goo. Blanket too!" What you need to do is give him edible goo, bog juice, and
the blanket. Bog juice can be made by a brewer. After giving him the bog juice
and goo, you will receive a banker's key "H.K. 102" for High Keep. You need to
give this to the bank clerk in highhold and she will give you a note to deliver
to Brother Hayle in Splitpaw. He will tell you the items you need to collect to
get soulfire: The Hilt of Soulfire, the Brilliant Sword of Faith, Your Testimony
and the letter you received from the bank clerk. The hilt is obtained by killing
a high level NPC, per Hayle's instructions. The <I>Brilliant Sword of Faith</I>
is found by killing Sir Lucan and returning the testimony you find on him to
Valeron. The testimony for this quest is obtained through doing the Test of
Truth quest, which is listed above on this page. </FONT><BR></DIV>
