Crystal of Capturing</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Ernax the Scholar in the Paineel
Library asks not to be bothered as he is studying mana storage devices. When
asked about a crystal of capturing, he responds that Jalen Goldsinger in the Tox
forest can make them. When hailed, Jalen Goldsinger only comments about the
murkyness of Tox forest. But when asked about the Heretics or about a Crystal of
Capturing, Jalen says that he will make you one if you will bring him some of
the components. He requires a Potion of Sorrow (not sure where that can be
found) and 1000 gold. It would seem that the crystal would be some item for
storing mana. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020637"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading690"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Darla Starfire</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to the female guildmaster in
the necro hut. She wants you to kill Darla Starfire, a level 5ish NPC who is
supplying the hated Kerrans. You will be rewarded for turning in her head.
</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020638"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading691"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Heretic battle</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Markus Jaevins, the Magician
Guildmaster, will ask you to get the heretic's remains from Jailmaster Lius.
Lius will tell you that the heretic escaped. the heritics are the various
Necromancers wandering around Tox Forest. If you bring the remains of any
heretic to Markus he will reward you. Kill one of them and return his remains
for experience, faction and a reward. Your faction raises with High Counsel of
Erudin and High Guard of Erudin, and lowers with Heritics. I don't know if the
reward is greater if you kill Talliger, who is the most powerful heretic.

<A NAME="Heading692"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Kobald Shaman Paws</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest starts in Erudin. The
Cleric Guildmaster apparantly has a feud with the Kobald Shamen. Some sort of
religious dispute I guess. She is a bloodthirsty sort and wants you to return
with the paws of her enemies. Go kill Kobald Shamen in Tox forest and return
with two paws and you will be rewarded.

<A NAME="Heading693"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Mining caps<A NAME="_Toc476020641"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Mining caps (a/k/a useless caps) are
sometimes dropped by kobald scouts (though not often). Take these caps to the
two skeleton miners at the entrance to Paineel. One will break off a part of
himself as a reward and give you a bone or some zombie skin (or occasionally a
<I>Fractured Femur</I>) and the other will reward you with a gem he recently
mined.</FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading694"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Poacher Heads</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest starts in Erudin. Those
nasty poachers wandering around Toxxulia haven't just annoyed you. They've
apparantly pissed off one of the townspeople who stands just outside the Temple
of Quellios. His request is a little gruesome, but hey it's a barbaric world out
there. Bring him head of a poacher and he will reward you with a little money,
experience and faction. The faction adjustments are as follows: KaranaBandits
worse; KaranaResidents better; GuardsofQeynos better; HighpassGuards better;
CircleofUnseenHands better. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020642"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading695"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Rungupp</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This annoying troll runs around the
forest screaming challenges to the Erudites. He can generally be located
somewhere along the shore from the bridge to the mountainside. He is fairly
tough to kill since he casts blindness on his adversaries. Take his head to
Marzius Denison at the necromancer's hut and you will get some money and an
item. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020643"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading696"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Skeleton Killing</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest starts in Erudin. talk to
one of the clerics in the Tample of Quellios and you will be given a box to use
to battle the undead. Fill it with bone chips and combine it to get a box of
bones. When you return it to the cleric you will get a random item, some money
and some faction. You may also get an additional quest. </FONT><BR></DIV>
