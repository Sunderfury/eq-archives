Blurred Map</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Tabure Ahendle, by the arena in
Qeynos, is concerned about a map her apprentice had on him when he was
shipwrecked while crossing over from Erudin. It is possible that you will have
to perform another quest before she tells you this information. On the island in
Erud's crossing, you can kill zombie sailors who will occasionally drop a
blurred map. Give this to her for some coin, xp and a minor item and the
following faction changes: raise Steel Warriors, Guards of Qeynos and Knights of
Truth and Lower Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia

Zombie Flesh</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>A guild trainer upstairs from the
Deepwater Knights guild in Erudin will ask you to fill a bag with zombie flesh.
She gives you a large bag in which you can put the zombie flesh and tells you
that the zombie flesh can be found near erud's crossing. Kill zombie sailors on
the island to harvest their flesh. This takes a pretty high level to survive. If
you want, you can buy 4 zombie skins from the cat merchant, but you won't get
your money back that way. Combine the bag and return it to the trainer for
experience, faction and a minor item.</FONT><BR></DIV>
