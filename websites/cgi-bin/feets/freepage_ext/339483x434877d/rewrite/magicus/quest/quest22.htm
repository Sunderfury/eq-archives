Ged's Gloves</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There is an NPC named Ged Twigborn
who hangs around another NPC and they will wander the forest at times. I usually
see them in one of two places: either along the same wall as the zone to the
commonlands, or by turning on the path off the main road from the sign pointing
towards Freeport. Ged will make you some gloves for a price. He makes ratskin,
wolfskin, bearhide, or lionskin gloves. All require some money and a specific
pelt. You need to be amiable with him to buy lionskin gloves. The <I>Ratskin
Gloves</I> cost 6 gold and a giant rat pelt (ac 3 , negative 5 charisma), the
<I>Bearskin Gloves</I> cost 25 gold and a high quality bear skin (ac 5), the
wolfskin gloves cost 13 gold and a high quality wolf pelt and the <I>Lionskin
Gloves</I> cost 96 gold and a high quality lion skin. I have been told that a
tiger spawns some times in the south west corner of Kith forest near the orc
spawn and gives a high quality skin, and that they are also dropped by highland
Lions in NK. The gloves are good for druids who can't wear metal.

Grim's Tiger Revenge</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you enter Kith from West Commons,
then follow the right wall like you're going to Rivervale, Grim Oakfist is in a
house with an innkeeper near the right wall, not too far from the ranger guild.
You must have higher than indifferent faction with the Ashen Order for Grim to
give you this quest. He says there are three named tigers in Kithicor that I
believe killed his family. He is here for revenge but cannot hunt them due to
the rangers all around Kithicor. He says he will reward you if you bring back
the pelts of these tigers. They come in different parts of the woods, one even
keeps roaring. They spawn after you talk to Grim. So the easiest way to find
these tigers is with a tracker-- but killing these tigers gives a hit to
ranger/druid faction. The tigers are around level 25, but they hit in the 40's
and each one drops a strange or unusual tiger pelt. When you return the three
pelts to Grim he thanks you and gives you a <I>Collar of Neshika</I>.

Rathe Mountains by unkempt druids and retreive Broken bow part A, part of Morins
Bow of Kithicor. Part B drops from Slaythe the Slayer in Lower Guk. Bring Leaf
both parts and he will give you the gauntlets. There seems to be no way to
instead combine these yourself to get a new bow. </FONT><BR></DIV>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Leaf needs the &#8221;Quiver of
Kithicor&#8221; and a Star of Odus, which can be purchased in Erudin. To get the
quiver, go to Kelethin and speak with Leutenant Leafstalker who tells you to
collect 6 different named arrows (Acknowledgment, bravery, defiance, gallantry,
fortitude and recognition) from the Outcast Brownies in Lesser Faydark (Kill
Pixe Tricksters and Pranksters to get the spawn). Then go to OOT and to Seafury
Isle. Kill the Buccaneers until Wiltin Windwalker spawns (he is a very rare
spawn) and kill him, hoping that he drops the Quiver. (I have also been told
that it may be a faster spawn if you don't kill the buccaneers). Get the Quiver
and combine the 6 Arrows. Return the Quiver to Leaf in Kithicor along with the
star. </FONT><BR></DIV>

Morin's Sword</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Morin Shadowbane, the multisexual
ranger guildmaster of the forest, sends you on a Quest for the new Ranger only
weapon, the Short Sword of Morin. There are two ways to get the sword. (1) If
you trade in an Ebony Bladed Sword to Morin, you will get a <I>Short Sword of
Morin</I>, a Ranger only weapon; or (2) She will also tell you that she will
give you her personal sword if you find and kill the Ghoul Messenger, who is
located "between Kithicor and the Karanas" and bring back his note, or whatever
he drops. The messenger spawns somewhere in Western Karana, is tough to anyone
not in his 30's, and is always running. He drops a map of Kithicor. Take that
map back and you will also receive the sword. You get the same sword for doing
this as for trading the Ebony Bladed Sword. </FONT><BR></DIV>
