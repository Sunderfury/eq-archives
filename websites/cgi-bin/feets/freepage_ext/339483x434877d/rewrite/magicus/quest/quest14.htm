Bone Chips</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The shadow knight guildmaster wants
you to collect bone chips for him. Get four chips,and return them for
experience, faction and an item (usually a rusty 2 handed sword). Your faction
for SKN and DarkOnes and Da Bashers goes up, factions FrogloksOfGuk and
BrokenSkullClan go down. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020256"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading143"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Fire Beetle Eyes</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In Grobb, talk to Basher Nindan or
something similar. His name doesn't matter, he doesn't move around. Right before
the tunnel to Innothule Swamp is Basher Razbaz. Go past him, away from the
tunnel and Priest of Discord, and there is a small river. Swim along it, and on
the right will be a cage with a Froglok prisoner and a Basher or two. Follow
this area's tunnel to the back, where the correct Basher is. If hailed, he tells
you to bring him 3 Fire Beetle eyes, and he will give you "shinies". You get a
minor gem or jewel for returning the items, and occasionally a minor magic item
(such as a <I>Brass Earring</I>). You also get a positive faction hit with Da
Bashers and a negative faction hit with the Broken Skull Clan.

Froglock Feeding</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Ranjor, the head of the Bashers is
hungry. If you bring him 1 Froglock Meat &amp; 2 Froglock Flesh to eat, he will
give you a little experience &amp; a rusty 2h battleaxe. You also get positive
faction with Da Bashers and negative faction with the Broken Skull Clan. You can
do it as much as you want. He must be really hungry.

Froglock Meat</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The shaman guildmaster, Kalagri (not
sure of name), wants you to collect 2 frogolok tad fleshes and 2 bone chips. She
will then give you a lvl 1 shaman spell, Burst of Flame, some experience and
faction. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020259"></A><BR></DIV>

Fungus Dung Pie</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Hergror is hungry, and he wants a
Fungus Dung Pie (yech). He says to go to tell Carver Cagrek "Hergror wants his
Fungus Dung Pie". He is the troll on the dias in front of the Shaman's Guild
near the bank. When you talk to Cagrek, he complains that Hergror is always
hungry and that he needs 4 Fungus Spores to make a pie, but not to hit them too
hard or you ruin them. The spores are dropped on a very rare occasion by fungus
spores in Innothule. If you complete this and give Hergror the pie, he will
award you with some patchwork, leather or raw-hide armor.

Greenblood Shadowknight Tunic</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>One of Hukulks chief lieutenants in
Nightkeep wants you to prove your worth by returning a Black Shadow Tunic from
the Greenblood Shadowknights. In fact, he really wants three such tunics. He
says he will open the coffers of nightkeep and pay you a reward. This is the
shadowkinght guild in Ogguk. You can get the tunic through a quest in Ogguk. You
will get xp, some gold, and a minor item.

HEHE meat</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest to get the
<I>Grobb Cleaver</I>. It starts in Grobb (of course). Talk to Carver, by the
Shaman's guild, and he will tell you he wants 3 pieces of a meat called "HEHE
meat" and the recipe to make it. You can purchase the meat in Oggok from Dooga
the Ogre Chef. (He has a seperate quest to deliver froglock legs). The recipe is
held by the Gobbler in Neriak. If you talk to the Gobbler about the recipe, he
will send you to deliver a Grub Locker of Dwarf Pickles to his Troll friend in
the Ocean of Tears, Nerbilik. You need to make the delivery. Nerbilik is fishing
on the Siren rocks. Be careful, since I have been told the guards may kill you
even though they con indifferent. Give him the locker and you will receive
approximately 1 plat, increased faction with DaBashers and decreased faction
with BrokenSkull Clan, and some xp. However, he will refuse to give you the
recipe he has, so you need to kill him and loot it from his corpse. This
seriously decreases your troll faction. Then take the recipe and 3 HEHE meats
back to Carver and he will give you a Grobb Cleaver for you efforts.

Hulkulk's Love</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Be forewarned that this quest will
lower your faction with the dark bargainers. In the Night Keep, talk to Hukulk.
He mentions [Helm of Hukulk], and upon asking him about the helm, he refers to a
Lynuga who broke his heart. Hukulk asks that you go to Neriak to see who Lynuga
meets with, possibly kill them, and return the head of her lover and the Bracers
of Love that he gave to her. In return, Hukulk will give you an extra Helm of
Hukulk. I am told you need to give him both the bracers and the head (presumably
of Lumpkin) to get the helm. Lynuga can be occasionally found floating in the
water near the entrance to Guk. She won't mention anything about the [Happy Love
Bracers] but if you ask her about them, she will tell you she gave the ugly
things to her boyfriend, Guard Lumpkin, in Neriak and that the relationship was
over. Lumpkin will tell you that Ratraz now has the bracers. Ratraz is a bouncer
in the Maiden's Fury in Neriak. You have to kill Ratraz. If he runs while your
fighting him, and you're a troll or ogre, be aware that you may have to duck
while chasing him through some of the lower arches in Neriak, so you will have
to reclick your autoattack. I haven't had anyone jump in on that battle yet and
I've let him run pretty far before. From him you will get the happy love bracers
(AC 1 bracers, I'd use them just for the name alone if they weren't so lousy),
his head, and a warclub. Watch out! You do NOT want to give his head to Hululk!
Lumpkin was the one who stole Lyguna from Hulkulk, not Ratraz! Either put his
head in a seperate container or destroy it. The warclub is a decent non-magic
blunt weapon that you can sell for quite a few plat. Ratraz is about 19th level.
Now you need to get Lumpkin's head. This is more of a trick. He is found in the
Foreign Quarter of Neriak. He runs around a couple of the back rooms. Attack him
when he is as deep in these rooms as he gets! He is also about 19th and tries to
run when hurt enough. If he gets far enough a high level shadow knight jumps in
and you're basically doomed. From him you get his head and a rusty halberd. Take
his head and the Happy Love Bracer's back to Hululk to get your prize, the
<I>Helm of Hukulk</I> AC5 +3 strength +3 agility, wearable by evil races only
helmet and some money (even up to some plat!) , experience, and Faction. Note
about factions. If your standing is too low with shadowknights (or perhaps if
you are not a troll shadowknight), you will get nothing for turning in the quest
items to Hulkulk. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020263"></A><BR></DIV>

Oven Mittens</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Carver Cagrek by the Shaman guild
(he's the guy standing by the partial corpse in the middle) will reward you with
a nice pair of <I>Grobb Oven Mittens</I> if you bring him 3 froglock meat and 10
gold. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020264"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading151"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Skeletons in the closet</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you go into the Shaman's Guild
and talk to the Shaman upstairs near the throne (I forget his name), he talks
about the head Shaman, Kallie (?). He says she hates him because he let some
skeletons of hers out of the closet and now they're running around Grobb causing
trouble. (funny) Apparently there are several skeletons running around the city
of Grobb. You are supposed to find all of them and ask them "Come Back to the
Closet" and see what they say. There are four skeletons you need to get. The
three that appear in town only appear one at a time, so you have to do them in
order. (1) After talking to Urako in the Shaman's guild, the first skeleton
appears by the barkeep. Hail him then say "come back to the closet." He will
complain that it is cramped and he just got out but will go back if he had a
pair of Oven Mitts. These are acquired by giving Cleaver Cagrek 3 froglok meat
and 10gp. Give him the mitts and he then becomes a skull item (lore, no drop) in
your inventory called "The Baker." (2) Once the gloves are given to the 1st
skel, he will say something about Basher Nanrum knowing where "The Butcher" is
and to ask him [wheres the skeleton]. When you ask Basher Nanrum [wheres the
skeleton], he tells you that the Butcher skeleton is right by Cleaver Cagrek
(which he is). "The Butcher" will say he wants an Ogre Butcher Apron to go back
to the closet. To get the Butcher Apron, you have to speak to Chef Dooga in
Oggok, and give her 3 pickled froglocks and 10 gold. The problem for trolls is
that Chef Dooga is KOS to trolls. To get around this, create a newbie ogre to
get the apron and give it to your Troll or get an Ogre friend to get it for you.
Give it to the skeleton and he will become a skull item called "the butcher".
(3) The next skeleton is The Captain. He only appears at night, doesn't always
appear, and is very hard to find (loc - 1617 , 773). He wants a ship in a
bottle. You can buy this either on an island in the middle of the Innothule
Swamp or from the bartender who stands next to Chef Dooga. The Ship in a Bottle
is no drop, so you have to get it yourself. If you try to get it from the
bartender, you will need a guise of the deceiver mask or an illusion spell of
some sort. (4) The final skeleton is The Minstrel. He wants four lizardman scout
fifes, which are dropped by lizardman scouts. When you turn in all four skulls,
you get a <I>Kaglari Mana doll</I>, which is probably not worth all of the stuff
you gave up to get it. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020265"></A><BR></DIV>

Spore Guardian</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is also given by
Hulkulk's assistant in the Shadowknight Guild. You have to get the head of the
Spore Guardian. The Spore Guardian spawns in the Innothule swamp, and it's
corpse sometimes has a "Huge Mushroom Head". Giving the mushroom head to the the
correct troll in the SK guild hall will get you a <I>Froglok Skin Mask</I>.
