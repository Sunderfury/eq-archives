Chalice of Conquest</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a long involved quest that
results in the <I>Holy Partisan of Underfoot</I>, and perhaps an even better
weapon, since there is an implication that there is more than what I have here.
For those who wish to just know how to start the quest, read below. Dru Razbind
who is fishing just north of Port Faydwer tells you he can no longer venture
into Kaladim because of a shame he suffered. He used to be a respected Paladin
of the Church of Underfoot, until he failed to complete a very [important task]
for Lord Datur Nightseer, who then striped Dru of his Cape of Underfoot, without
which he can't enter Kaladim anymore. When you ask him what the important task
was he says... "I was ordered by Lord Nightseer to carry the [Chalice of
Conquest] to a noble band of Paladins within the mountains of Rathe. While
there, the entire camp was overtaken by a band of orcs. During the battle there
was a [strange occurrence]. " When you ask him what the Chalice of Conquest is
he says... "The Chalice of Conquest is said to be delivered to the Church of
Underfoot from Brell himself. It is said whoever drinks from the chalice is
assured victory in battle. It is also said that only good natured creatures can
safely drink from it and only a state of comatose is assured to any evil
creature who dares to sip from it." When you ask him about the strange
occurrence he says... "A large fray raged. Brave, valiant paladins fought vile
green skinned Orcs and while this happened I spied the [Chalice of Conquest]
being taken away from the camp. I was then distracted by a well placed Orcish
blade. After I defeated the Orcs within my way I turned to see a blue Orc
running towards the horizon. I gave chase to no avail. I lost the chalice and
all respect. If only a [noble Paladin of Underfoot] would assist me." If you
tell him that you are a noble Paladin of Underfoot he replies..."Yes, you shall
do noble &lt;name&gt;. Take this. This is the Chalice Case. It is intended for
the Chalice of Conquest and for the [Candle of Bravery]. If you should get both
then be sure to place them within the Chalice Case and combine it. Take the full
Chalice Case to Lord Nightseer in Kaladim and I shall be redeemed and you shall
surely earn a fine paladin's reward. Let your quest begin in the mountains of
Rathe." When you ask him about the Candle of Bravery he replies... "The Candle
of Bravery is ceremonial and is lit when one sips from the [Chalice of
Conquest]. The candlestick was left with a fellow paladin of Underfoot within
the Rathe Mountains. The candle itself was lost, and I do not know where
Priestess Ghalea purchases them."</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020139"></A><BR></DIV>

Going Postal</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a massive quest involving
most of the cities in Norrath. See the full quest description in Ak'Anon and the
reference table at the end of this
document.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020140"></A><BR></DIV>

Ogre Heads</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In the warrior guild in Kaladim
there is a dwarf male named Byzar Bloodforge. He is looking for the heads of the
ogres Zarchoomi and Corflunk who roam the countryside of Butcherblock. If you
ask Byzar "What about Corflunk?" He responds with, don't mention those names, I
hate those ogres and would pay handsomely for their heads. He does the same if
you ask about Zarchoomi. You must give him both heads, and then he will say he
underestimated you and give you experience, faction, some coin and a decent item
(This used to be blackened mail, but now you seem to only get various pieces of
bloodforge mail, which generally has the same stats, but can only be worn by
dwarf clerics, paladins or warriors). Your faction with Stormguard, Kazon
Stormhammer, MinersGuild 249 and Merchants of Kaladim will all get better, and
your faction with CrakenkWarriors gets worse. He will then give you the Trumpy
Irontoe Quest. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020141"></A><BR></DIV>

Orc Runner<A NAME="_Toc476020142"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial">Weil ich gerade vorhin von einem Paladin
gesprochen habe, da f&auml;llt mir grad noch was ein. Da gibt&#8217;s in
Felwithe noch einen anderen Paladin... oder ists gar der selbe? ... ach was weis
ich, es ist schon so lang her... auf jeden Fall war sein Name Jyleel oder so,
war dort irgendwas besonderes, so eine Art General... ja genau, Lord Jyleel
meine ich.</FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial">Wenn ihr mit ihm redet wird er euch
sicherlich bitten einen Kurier der Orks abzufangen der eine wichtige Botschaft
bef&ouml;rdert... oder wars ein Goblin... na so ein Critter
halt.</FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Wie auch immer, ihr k&ouml;nnt
diesen L&auml;ufer in den Butcherblock Mountains finden wo er vom Durchgang zu
Graeter Faydark zur Crossroad l&auml;uft. Irgendwie haben es diese
d&auml;mlichen Orks immer noch nicht geschnallt da&szlig; der Grund warum keiner
ihrer Boten sein Ziel erreicht jener ist, da&szlig; sie von den Zwergenwachen an
der Crossroad erschlagen werden ... Und das beste daran ist da&szlig; sie
f&uuml;r diese Botendienste nicht gerade ihre schw&auml;chsten Leute
losschicken, sie d&uuml;rften so etwa im 8ten Erfahrungskreis sein,
hehehe</FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Diese Boten haben meist einen Beutel
und einen versiegelten Brief dabei. Wenn ihr Lord Jyleel den Brief &uuml;bergebt
wird es eurem Ruf zur Ehre gereichen, und vielleicht erteilt er euch auch noch
einen weiteren Auftrag ....</FONT><BR></DIV>

Orc Runner No 2</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is given by Dill
Fireshine after you do the orc hatchet quest. You need to kill the orc runner
and return his damaged pouch to Dill Fireshine. He will also ask you for a note
which can sometimes be found on the orc runner. The orc runner can be found in
butcherblock. He runs around a lot, but the easiest place to find him is by the
two cabins hunting area. The faction changes are as follows: Faction with
Faydarks Champions, King Tearisthex, Clerics of Tunare and Soldiers of Tunare
gets better, and Crushbone Orcs gets worse. You sometimes get a pretty nice
reward for this (sometimes worth several platinum), and a decent experience
boost.</FONT><BR></DIV>
