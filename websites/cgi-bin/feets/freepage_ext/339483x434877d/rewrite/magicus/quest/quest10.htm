Barnacle Breastplate</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you talk to Weligon Steelherder,
the guildmaster of the deepwater knights in Erudin, he will talk about some
deepwater tasks, then on to a diseased shark. He asks for you to kill a diseased
shark that is endangering the life of the ocean, fill the bag with the sharks
remains, and the remains of 3 of its young. If you go to the docks, and kill the
diseased shark, you will get shark items, plus some shark skin that is a lore
item. The Diseased Shark is about level 10. Save the shark skin lore item, and
kill the young baby sharks that spawned. Each young shark has a baby shark
remains no drop lore item, which you need for the quest. Place the diseased
shark skin lore item, and three of the remains (seperately in the last 3 slots
of the bag), and combine. The bag becomes a no drop lore item, which you return
to the guildmaster and recieve a BLUE chestplate. The chestplate is only 8ac and
sv 3 heat and cold resistances. However, it looks very spiffy, and is great for
parties, gatherings, and weddings =) It's a darker blue than crafted armor too.
Supposedly, if you are a high enough level and have good enough faction, he will
then give you the quest which results in the Deepwater harpoon.

The Bridge</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Weligon Steelherder is concerned
about a plan afoot to build a bridge linking Antonica and Odus. Apparantly there
are three engineers who have conceived this plan, and if he can only eliminate
them, Odus will be safe from the influence of the lesser races. He wants you to
bring him the plans and the head of the three engineers who put them together,
and promises to reward you with your very own <I>Deep Six Cutlass</I>. The list
with the engineers names on it can be found in a house In South Qeynos just off
the square with the clock tower, opposite the tax collector's house. When Hansl
Bigroon leaves the house, he will drop the list. It lists the names of the three
engineers. First is Trantor Everhot. This dwarf can be found in North Kaladim
going between the mine and Everhot's Forge. Second is Joogl Doobrough, who is a
gnome at the Steamfont Windmills. Third is Purchin Oddsbot, who is on the
grounds at the Academy of Arcane Science in West Freeport and occasionally can
be found in Highpass. You will take some serious faction hits for killing these
three. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020164"></A><BR></DIV>

Catfish Tail</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to one of the Paladins standing
below the Temple of Quellious. He will ask if you want to "face fear" and when
you say yes, he will tell you to go to Kerra Island and kill a Cat Fisher, and
bring back his tail for a little money, experience, faction and an item (usually
a brass ring). This quest will not be given after level 12.

Clear Water</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you are a paladin, you can get
Clear Water and/or a guild coin by talking to the Bank manager and asking him
for vasty deep water. He says your guild must have sent you to get it and asks
you to bring him a guild coin and he will give you the water. Go back to the
temple and ask for a guild coin ,which will be given with the message remember
this is not currency. The coin is a lore item that gives +10 mana. Give this to
the banker and he will give you the water and some experience and some faction.,
I'm not sure what you do with the water, so you may just want to keep the coin
for the mana boost. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020166"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading53"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Erud's Tonic</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is an item needed in several
quests. To get an Erud's Tonic go to the Hawk's Inn in Erudin and buy an
Innoruk's Kiss of Death (LORE ITEM). Go to the top floor of the library and give
the Drink to Sinnkin Highbrow, the bookworm. She'll give you the Erud's Tonic
(no drop lore item) in exchange. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020167"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading54"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Fisherman Convert</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>A guild trainer upstairs from the
Deepwater Knights guild in Erudin will ask you to convert a fisherman in Qeynos.
She tells you that the fisherman will break his pole and give it to you to
return back to her for fulfilling the quest. This fisherman is located in the
pond of N. Qeynos. Dive into the pond and go into the sewers. In the sewers,
there is a fisherman near the "main open area" of the aquaducts (he is not there
all the time). Talk to him and he will tell you that he is willing to go back to
worshipping the God of Prexus if you will give him your guild tunic (I assume
you must still have your guild tunic to fulfill this quest). Give him the tunic
and he will give you his broken fishing pole. Then take the broken pole back to
the guild trainer and she will give you experience, faction standing and an
item, possibly an orange ring.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020168"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading55"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Going Postal</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a massive quest involving
most of the cities in Norrath. See the full quest description in Ak'Anon and the
reference table at the end of this
document.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020169"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading56"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Heretic battle</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Markus Jaevins, the Magician
Guildmaster, will ask you to get the heretic's remains from Jailmaster Lius.
Lius will tell you that the heretic escaped. The heritics are the various
Necromancers wandering around Tox Forest. It may be that any of the heritics
will sometimes drop the bones that he is looking for, but the one who always
does is Elia Brook, who hangs out next to the dock. Kill him and return his
remains for experience, faction and a small reward. When you kill the heritics,
your faction raises with High Counsel of Erudin and High Guard of Erudin, and
lowers with Heritics. Turning in the head raises the Peacekeepers and lowers the
heretics. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020170"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading57"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
High Guard Battlestaff</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After you finish the Peacekeeper
Staff quest in Erudin, Lumi will comment that you are ready for more advanced
duties, she says "We have heard that there is a person in the mountain keep
called High Hold who is hiring mercenaries to attempt to obtain a High Guard
Battlestaff. We are missing one of our staffs and believe this person has it. Go
to Highpass High Hold and find this person and return the High Guard Battle
Staff to me." She is supposed to give you a container to put the staff pieces
in, but I have been told she does not do it, so this may be broken. Go to
Highkeep and talk to the banker. She says she will clear out old strongbox
accounts if given the key. The key is gained from an npc named Tallus Holton,
who is located in East Karana. Attacking him also draws his bandit cronies so I
suggest a team approach or a level 25 to 30 individual. If you kill him, you get
a staff segment (a lore item) and a Highkeep Strongbox Key. Give the banker the
key and she gives you a few gold,a little experience and a faction adjustment
plus one more staff segment. Combine them in the box and return them to Lumi to
get a High Guard Battlestaff (Not sure of the stats, but I think they are Eru
Pal Cler only, 5/33, +10 char) </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020171"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading58"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Ice Goblin Beads</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Josper Kenshed in the
wizards guild and he will ask you to go to Everfrost and fill a bag full of ice
goblin beads for him. Return to the Wizard's Guild in Erudin and take the bag to
Josper Kenshed. He will say, " Well done my young apprentice. I call you
apprentice, fore you are nothing but a spark to my fire. This is the final
component for my greatest creation... AHA!! I call it.. Iced Tea!! Never again
shall I boil under the hot sun. As for you, take this. It should serve you well.
Now go away. There is no Iced Tea for you." You will get a faction increase with
the Crimson Hands, High Council of Erudin and the High Guards of Erudin and a
decrease with the Heretics, experience, a few gold and a <I>Servant's Staff</I>.

<A NAME="Heading59"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Ilanic's Scroll</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Josper Kenshed in the wizards guild
also mentions a [special matter]. Ask him about it and he will ask you to find
the skeleton Ilanic and ask him [where is the scroll?]. Apparently, he sent his
apprentice Ilanic to test his new spell icecapades, which others call column of
frost, but only gave him half the spell and it backfired and he has been lookin
for Ilanic for awhile now. He says Ilanic wanders Tox forest. He says when you
bring the scroll half back to him he'll give the complete spell. I'm not sure
where you find Ilanic, but the half scroll can be found on a Kobald caster in
Tox forest, which is a pretty rare spawn. For completing the quest you will get:
The spell Column of frost, exp, good faction with The Crimson hands, The high
council and the High guard of Erudin, and Bad faction with the
Heretics.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020173"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading60"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Inert Potion</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>On the third floor of the castle,
Toresian Fhabel is waiting for someone to take an inert potion down to Vials of
Vitality, on the first floor of the castle, and give it to Slansin. There are
two people who you can give the potion to. Some times the correct person (with a
single name, not a surname) 'spawns' in the shop and if you hand the bottle to
him, you gain with several Erudin Factions. Usually (it may now be always) if
you run this quest then "A Gate Bandit", [now also named Slansin?] will spawn in
place of the person you are supposed to give the bottle to. If you hand the
bottle to the bandit, the following factions go up: Coalition of Trade Folk Ill,
Coalition of Tradefolk, Carson McCabe, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and The Freeport
Militia. The best part of these faction changes is that it raises lots of hard
to raise factions without lowering any others. You can do this over and over
again to improve all these factions at once. This bandit is about L10 or 11, and
it is possible that killing him starts a new quest by talking to one of the
NPC's in the shop. Also, the bandit tells you that a friend will avenge his
death [of course that is standard language], and if you take the boat to Qeynos
after doing the quest, a guard will sometimes attack you when you get off. I
don't know what happens if you defeat the guard.

Kobald Shaman Paws</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Lernena Shelyrak of the Cleric's
Guild apparantly has a feud with the Kobald Shamen. Some sort of religious
dispute I guess. She is a bloodthirsty sort and wants you to return with the
paws of her enemies. Go kill Kobald Shamen in Tox forest and return with three
paws and you will be rewarded. This quest will not be given after level 12.

<A NAME="Heading62"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Library Book</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on
the top floor of the temple of divine light in Erudin, he will tell you to fetch
a book from the library. This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep
Quest. The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top
floor knows the person who last checked it out. When you ask him, he tells you
that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he
was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state. He tells you to go talk to
his sister who is in the Erudin Palace. Once there, she says to meet her just
outside the hotel in town to talk to her. When you meet her, she explains that
her brother is still alive. Her brother is at Crows (It seems he is sick and is
in need of some Erud's Tonic. This is a side quest). Ask him about The Testament
of Vanear. He says yes he has it and will sell it to me for 2 gold. If you give
him the 2 gold he gives you the book which has to inventory slots and a combine
button in it. He then laughs and tells you that a thief stole pages 30 and 34
and the book is worthless without them. He also says that the thief sold the
pages to someone named Ran. If you then ask him who Ran is he tells you that Ran
Flamespinner is a librarian in Highpass. If you go to Highpass and ask about The
Testament of Vanear he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named
Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the
uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he
could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell
it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see
a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden
camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dyllin Starsine. Kill
him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the
Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport). Beware that any smugglers around him will
come to his aid. Faction hits when you kill him are: (-Corrupt Qeynos Guard,
+Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers) The
faction hits for him are pretty lagre, so be aware after that of potentially
slipping to KOS in Qeynos. After going back to Qeynos, I went back to Moodoro
and said I want page 34. He said ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty
smart of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I
get it because the work is fiction anyway. He then offers to play a game with
you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a
jester he will give you the page. Along with the jester, you might also draw the
King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight. [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the
dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward]. Once the whole thing is combined you
get the <I>Testament of Vanear</I>, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and
is a no drop lore item. You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return
the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum. (NOTE: I am
told that you can avoid Erudin completely by giving Moodoro Finharn 2gp (the
same guy that you get page 34 from) and he gives you the 2-slot book of the
testament of Vanear. Once you get the book, you can combine the page you get
from Moodoro (by playing his card game) and the other page from Dylin in
HighHold Pass and you've got the book! No need to go to Erudia. And because
Moodoro sometimes hangs out at one of the sewer entrances, evil races could
sneak in and get the book, too. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020176"></A><BR></DIV>

Nicked Coins</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There is a paladin in the deepwater
paladin quild (1st floor) whom asks for proof of thieves swimming in the harbor
in Erudin. If you kill one of these npcs (faction hit with circleof unseenhands
is worsen) you might find a Nicked coin (Lore Item). Take the nicked coin back
to him and he will reward you with silvers and factions.

Odus Pearls</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Weligon Steelherder, the guildmaster
of the deepwater knights in Erudin, wants you to bring him 4 odus pearls. He
gives you a bag to combine them in. Giving hin the bag raises faction with The
High Counsel of Erudin and the Deepwater Knights (one of the few ways I know to
raise the Deepwater faction needed for several Paladin quests) and lowers it
with the Heritics. You also get some coin and an item (often rawhide armor).

<A NAME="Heading65"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Peackeeper Staff</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest will not be given after
level 9 or so. Speak to Lumi Stergnon in the clerics guild and offer to retrieve
the peackeeper staff. He will hand you a letter which you should take to Emil
Parsini, a merchant in the first hut outside of Erudin in the Tox Forest. When
you give him the note, you will gain faction with the Merchants of Erudin, which
is a useful faction adjustment. He will give you a staff to fill with treant
resin and an odus pearl. In the harbor there is a place where you can at times
find 2 Odus Pearls under 2 Sand Sharks fairly close together (on a side note
sometimes there will be NPC's seen swimming here who I believe also collect the
pearls, if you kill one of these NPC's they say the Circle of Unseen Hands will
get revenge your faction with the Qeynos Guards goes up faction with corrupt
guards and the circle of the unseen hands go down I also think faction with
Qeynos merchants went down)... You want to get both of these because in order to
get the treant chips you need to talk to a man in the upstairs of the cobbler
shop in North Qeynos... he says he will give you some treant chips if you do a
favor for him... the favor is to get him 4 Odus pearls. Give him the pearls and
he will give you the treant chips you need to get the treant resin made. Once
you combine an odus pearl (from the harbor) with the resin, you get a
peacekeeper staff (Damage 4/Speed 30--weapon for clerics and paladins). If you
return the staff to the cleric, he will give you faction, xp, a random item and
an additional quest, or you can keep the staff. This quest will not be given
after level 12. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020179"></A><BR></DIV>

Poacher heads</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Those nasty poachers wandering
around Toxxulia haven't just annoyed you. They've apparantly pissed off one of
the townspeople who stands just outside the Temple of Quellios. His request is a
little gruesome, but hey it's a barbaric world out there. Bring him head of a
poacher and he will reward you with a little money, experience and faction. The
faction adjustments are as follows: KaranaBandits get worse; KaranaResidents,
GuardsofQeynos, HighpassGuards and CircleofUnseenHands get better. Also, after
bring back several heads and bone boxes, the npc ask you to find out who rules
the poaches. You are told that you must find a clue on the body of a poacher,
and the one who summons the skeletons and bring back their head. I don't know
the outcome of this part of the quest.

faction with the Gatecallers (at least amiable) he will tell you to bring him 2
summoned food and 2 summoned Daggers. Give them to him. Make sure that the food
is not stacked when you give it to him, and you will get a pair of <I>Gloves of

you will be given a box to use in your battle. Fill it with bone chips and
combine it to get a box of bones. When you return it to the cleric you will get

Vasty Deep Water</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you go talk to one of the
Paladins on the top floor of the temple of divine light, he will tell you to
fetch a book from the library. This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep
Quest. The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top
floor knows the person who last checked it out. When you ask him, he tells you
that the person who checked out the book is names Modorro and that he was
executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state. He tells you to go talk to his
sister who is in the Erudin Palace. Once there, she says to meet her just
outside the hotel in town to talk to her. When you meet her, she explains that
her brother is still alive. She'll then tell you how Moodoro got corrupted by a
halfling named Flynn Merrington. They used to sell the valuable Vasty Deep
Water, till Moodoro got caught. Here's where there is a catch, part of getting
to the quest requires asking a question that is not in brackets. Some people may
miss it that way. Nolusia says that she created a doppleganger to die in
Moodoro's place. You must ask Nolusia 'What is a doppleganger' or 'What about
the doppleganger?' Even though it is not in brackets. She'll tell you it died in
Moodoro's place and he relocated to Qeynos, and that she is afraid that he's
started up again because of Flynn. Lanken Rjarn knows, and they're both afraid
that the High Council will learn of it. So she wants to murder Flynn Merrington.
She wants you to return a bottle of Vasty deep water to her, so that she can
poision it to give it to Flynn. If you say yes, she tells you to find out how
they get their Vasty Deep Waters and to bring a bottle to her and she will
poison the lip you are then to take it to Flynn not Moodoro and that will end
everything. You can get Vasty Deep Waters by talking to the Bank manager and
asking him for it (it may be that only an enchanter can use it for this quest
though). He says your guild must have sent you to get it. Bring me a guild coin
and I will give you the water. Go back to the temple and ask for a guild coin
which will be given with the message remember this is not currency. The coin is
a lore item that gives +10 mana. Give this to the banker and he will give you
the water and some experience and some faction. Then go back and gave the water
to the sister. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020184"></A><BR></DIV>

the island to harvest their flesh. This takes a pretty high level to survive. If
