Book of Turmoil</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In the Library at the 3rd gate is a
scribe named Lokar To'Biath. If you give him a bottle of red wine he will give
you some exp and it will improve your faction with the Dread Guards Outer/Inner
and the Dark Bargainers. He will then tell you he mentions his sister and her
vow. If you ask Lokar To'Biath about his sister's vow..."What vow?" He says a 70
gold tithe to Innourok may help. He then gives you the note to his sister , who
is disguised as a female barkeep in the Blind Fish Tavern. When you find her,
you can ask her about being a scribe of dal and about the book of turmoil. Give
her the note from her brother and she gives you a note written in Tier'Dal, the
note says that she will give you the book if you return to her the head of her
brother, because he has betrayed her secret, and the note. Go back and kill him
and take his head and the note back to the barkeep. (You will also sometimes get
a bloody robe, and AC 2 no drop lore item, but I'm not sure what to do with
that). She will give you the book of turmoil. This in turn can be given to the
Oracle in the Ocean of Tears as part of the <I>Tome of Ages</I> quest. (you get
a glowing torch as a reward). </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020378"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading281"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Death of Lyda Nasin</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>It is possible that you have to
complete the message intercept quest first to get his quest. The guild master of
the Ebon Masks in Neriak sends you to freeport to speak to the same dark elf who
spawns at night down by the docks. She gives you a mission to kill Lyda Nasin,
the daughter of the Owner of the Seafarers Roost. She spawns on the second floor
of the Seafarers in the morning, however Dark elves are KOS if they enter the
bar (with the new ability to move and stay hidden perhaps the thieves can now
complete this one...) In any case an easier way to kill her is to hire someone
to go upstairs and tell her that a ship has docked. She will come outside to the
pier where she can be killed. You get faction, some cash, and a minor item.

Fire Beetle Eyes &amp; Mammoth Tusks</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>An NPC on the top floor of the
Necromancer Guild Hall named Noxhil wants young Teir'Dal to assist him with some
[menial duties] that he has. If you choose to help, he will give you a box which
you need to fill with 10 fire beetle eyes and combine. When you hand the
combined box in you get a few coppers and he mentions [other components]. When
you ask him about the other components, he then tells you to get 4 kerran fire
beetle eyes and a bull elephant tusk. There are no bull elephant tusks in the
game. In order to do this quest, you give him a Mammoth tusk instead. Mammoths
are found way over in Everfrost and the Kerran Beetle Eyes are found in Erud's
Crossing, so you will have to do some hiking to get him his stuff. Also, Bull
Elephants, which are found in South Karana, do occasionally drop mammoth tusts
as well (who knows why). When you give him the Mammoth tusk and the combined box
of Kerra Island beetle eyes, you will get some experience and a reward. I
received level 12 necro spells each of the three times I did the quest. He then
tells you that you seem to be of sufficient level to assist [The Dead]. Here the
quest series is broken, and I could not get him to tell me his third quest.

<A NAME="Heading283"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Fire Goblin Runner</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Narex T'vem in the Warrior's
Guild in Neriak. He will ask you to go to the Lavastorm Mountains and look for a
Fire Goblin Runner who is supplying an Erudite. The runner often zips right
through the area by the zone entrance, and is a fairly low level. If you kill
the Fire Goblin Runner and return his Runner Pouch you will receive some
experience, money and sometimes a <I>Featherweight Pouch</I>. He doesn't give
the quest to higher levels, but still gives the reward for the pouch.

<A NAME="Heading284"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Going Postal</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a massive quest involving
most of the cities in Norrath. See the full quest description in Ak'Anon and the
reference table at the end of this
document.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020382"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading285"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Halfling Raider Helm</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>A Guard in Foreign Quarter will
announce that the indigo brotherhood is looking for some to kill halfling
raiders, located in the camps in Nektulos. He will direct you to go talk to the
brotherhood for more information. A warrior in the guild will tell you he will
pay you 1 GP for every Halfing Raider cap you return to him. Get some gold,
experience, and faction increase/decrease. I am told you need to give them to
him 4 at a time. You may also get a <I>Footman's Voulge</I>.

<A NAME="Heading286"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Honeybugger Assasin</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Paziu Puno (rogue guild neriak)
wants Lil Honeybugger dead and promises a "king's reward" for her head. She
lives in Misty Thicket in the Halfling territory just outside of town.
Unfortunately, she rooms with her big brother Joogl Honeybugger who never seems
to leave her side, and he is probably around level 10 or so. Since you need to
be below this level to get the quest, you had better get some help in killing
her. When you kill Lil, she drops a halfling head (which is what you're supposed
to bring back to Paziu Puno for your "kings reward"), a bandage (so you can
reverse the faction hit you take from killing Lil by giving it to Joogl later),
and a Case of Jum Jum Juice (lore item)(which I guess you can give to the
treant). Here's where this quest gets funny. After sneaking/hiding through
Rivervale and making the run back to Neriak, you need to give the halfling head
to Paziu Puno. He then tells you something to the effect of "Foolish young elf.
This was no contract from King Naythox. I wanted Lil Honeybugger killed before
she gave birth to my child. Only a naive dark elf would set foot in Halfling
territory. Here's your great reward, garbage from other guild exploits." You get
some exp, a few cp, a minor item, and the usual rogue dark elf faction hits
(better with Ebon Mask, worse with guards of qeynos, guardians of the vale, and
wolves of the north). Never trust a dark elf.

<A NAME="Heading287"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Kerran Beetle Eyes</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(All Classes) This quest is
initiated in Neriak. An NPC in the Necromancer Guild will ask you to venture to
far away Kerra Island on the continent of Odus and collect beetle eyes for him.
If you choose to accept this rather onerous task, you will get a box which you
need to fill with eyes, combine and return for experience and a small reward.
The beetles are located on the island with the Kerran village in Erud's
Crossing. Be aware that the local Kerrans don't take kindly to your killing
their beetles. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020385"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading288"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Messages for Neriak</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In the Necromancer Guild hall you
will find a NPC who needs your help as a courier. (the same one who asks about
fire beetle eyes) He wants you to seek out three individuals and ask them if
they have any messages for Neriak. Your reward for each completed message is
some money and experience. The first messenger is located in the Western
Commonlands. The second person on the list, Cytodl Krish, is on the second floor
of the Inn that is NE of the entrance to the High Hold Keep. I'm not sure where
the other one is. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020386"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading289"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Moss Snakes</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Hekzin G'Zule in rogue's
guild and he will say he is working on some new type of armor. He needs someone
to go collect 3 moss snake skins and 3 teeth. Bring them back to him and
increase your popularity with guild and receive some minor items (usually one or
more rations or iron rations). However, you may receive the <I>Dark Shield of
Ebon</I>. Faction changes are as follows: Raised: Ebon Mask; Lowered: Wolves of
the North, Carson McCabe, Qeynos Guards, Guardians of the Vale.

level Necromancer pet research from the 3 Sisters (X&#180;Ta Tempi, Timpi, and
Tompi) in Neriak Foreign Quarters (-10, -45). It is really easier to get them
though randomly looting creatures than by doing the quests. </FONT><BR></DIV>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Eigentlich gibt es keinen Grund,

auch diesen Teil:</FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Sprecht mal mit Lovehill, einem

ihr die <A HREF="quest29.htm#_Ref476379560">Sir Lindeal's Testimony</A>-Quest zu
Ende gef&uuml;hrt habt. Er wird Dir einen Brief in die Hand dr&uuml;cken, denn
Du schleunigst an Kizdon Gix in die Western Commonlands zu &uuml;berbringen
hast. Hast Du ihn gefunden und ihm den Brief &uuml;berreicht beauftragt er Dich
die 3 Teile des Mallets zu finden und an Lovehill zu &uuml;bergeben.
Au&szlig;erdem bekommst Du einen weiteren Brief, der an seinen alten
Sch&uuml;ler Lrodd geliefert werden soll.</FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Der Satz, den Du an Kizdean Gix
richten mu&szlig;t um den Brief f&uuml;r Lrodd zu erhalten muss genau der

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Nun, leider ist der
ungl&uuml;ckselige Lrodd bereits tot, aber man kann sein Skelett im 1. Level von

bekommst sogar die Information, dass Du f&uuml;r das Mallet nach Windstream
suchen musst.</FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Um es einfach zu sagen: man findet
die ben&ouml;tigten 3 Teile auf 2 verscheidenen Gegnern. Die Klinge und der Kopf
des Mallets findet mal auf Elfenskeletten. Die <I>Stem</I> h&auml;lt Commander
Windstream, welcher im 3. Level von Befallen sein Unwesen treibt. Aber seid auf
der Hut, Commander Windstream ist ein Zombie, der mindestens der 20.
Erfahrungszirkel hat. Alles was nun zu tun ist, nachdem alle Teile gesammelt
wurden, die Klinge und den Kopf in das <I>Stem</I> (ein Container im

entstehende <A HREF="Thexmallet.jpg">Thex Mallet</A> zu behalten und benutzen.

keep your starting shortsword). Doing so results in a faction raise with the
Indigo Brotherhood, and faction drops with three good guilds (The Emerald

this NPC to complete Quest #2. Note that Yegek says you must do it without a
blade, but you can use a weapon. He is hard to kill, but can be done by levels 4
