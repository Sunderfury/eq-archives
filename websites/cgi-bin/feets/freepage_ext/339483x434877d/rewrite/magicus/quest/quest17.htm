The Bloody Shank</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Be warned that this quest can really
mess with your faction with the deep pockets. Visit the Captain standing out on
a balcony in Highhold Keep. Hail him and answer his questions. It seems a petty
rogue escaped the dungeon in Highhold Keep but left behind crucial evidence. The
rogue's <I>Bloody Shank</I> was sticking out of a guards back! The Captain gives
you the shank to take to the rogue to let the rogue know why you are there to
kill him. The rogue's name is Bronin Higginsbot and he hangs around the
Deeppockets in Rivervale. He may sometimes be found around the southernmost
tower in Misty Thicket. Hand him the bloody shank and then kill him, but be
careful because a bodyguard sometimes spawns next to him when you hand him the
shank and also the guards will help him if they are nearby. Handing him the
dagger and killing him lowers faction with Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands,
Coalition of Trade Folk III and Carson McCabe and raises it with Merchants of
Rivervale. Return his head for decent money and experience, and occasionally a
<I>Scouts Blade</I>. You will raise faction with Highpass Guards, Carson McCabe,
Merchants of Highpass, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia. There is also
a rogue named Shayde Higginsbot on the second floor of the Fool's Gold. When you
hand him the bloody shank he does not give the generic (Thank you.) response.
Not sure what happens if you slay him too.

Eye of Stormhammer</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest for the <I>Avenger
Battle Axe</I>. After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner clockwork quest)
to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him "what important stormguard matter". He will
give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank of High Pass keep. Of
course the prisoner has escaped but she does give you part of the eye of
stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has the other part, the "Emerald
Shard". Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in Rivervale and sometimes near the
southern tower in Misty Thicket. When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he
says he will give it to you if you do a small favor. Apparently a bounty hunter
by the name of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body,
he will give you the emerald. Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket. He
appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)! He hops around between the Orc
camp and the wall. You may have to talk to Bronin to get him to spawn. If you
defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore item), a few gold, and the following
faction adjustments: Frogloks of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of
Kurnak and Iskar get better. When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells
you that he put the emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives
you a key to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold. The key is labeled
H.K.106. Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and
the following faction adjustments: Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands,
Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of River
Vale gets worse. When you turn in the key in highpass bank, you get the emerald
shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the following adjustments:
Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson McCabe all get better. Bronin
also says "There is a [second Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will
need it..." Upon further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the
Gem of Tunare, and is being held by a guild in Kelethin. In Kelethin, go to the
Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about the
Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The only one
who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting "at the lake
near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to Dagnor's Cauldron
and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his brother is a thief (and
only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone to Qeynos, probably to work
for the thieves guild there. Faldor Hendrys is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he
can be found walking out the front gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills
zone sometimes. He may also sometimes be found in Crows Tavern. You need to kill
him to get the gem. Combine the parts and you get the eye of stormguard, which
gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection. If you give it to Beno, he gives
you a long speach about how wonderful a warrior you are and says he is giving
you a "warrior's true weapon designed by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl
Mizebrite." He then will give you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice
warrior only 2HS weapon. It is likely that you need to have a very high faction
with him to get the axe. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020286"></A><BR></DIV>

Going Postal</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a massive quest involving
most of the cities in Norrath. See the full quest description in Ak'Anon and the
reference table at the end of this
document.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020287"></A><BR></DIV>

High Guard Battlestaff</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After you finish the Peacekeeper
Staff quest in Erudin, Lumi will comment that you are ready for more advanced
duties, she says "We have heard that there is a person in the mountain keep
called High Hold who is hiring mercenaries to attempt to obtain a High Guard
Battlestaff. We are missing one of our staffs and believe this person has it. Go
to Highpass High Hold and find this person and return the High Guard Battle
Staff to me." She is supposed to give you a container to put the staff pieces
in, but I have been told she does not do it, so this may be broken. Go to
Highkeep and talk to the banker. She says she will clear out old strongbox
accounts if given the key. The key is gained from an npc named Tallus Holton,
who is located in East Karana. Attacking him also draws his bandit cronies so I
suggest a team approach or a level 25 to 30 individual. If you kill him, you get
a staff segment (a lore item) and a Highkeep Strongbox Key. Give the banker the
key and she gives you a few gold,a little experience and a faction adjustment
plus one more staff segment. Combine them in the box and return them to Lumi to
get a High Guard Battlestaff (Not sure of the stats, but I think they are Eru
Pal Cler only, 5/33, +10 char) </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020288"></A><BR></DIV>

Illegible Scroll</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>On the 3rd floor there is a gnome
NPC named Lozani. If you give him an illegible scroll and 4 gold or two
illegible cantrips he will translate it for you. Once it's translated you get a
lower level spell back. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020289"></A><BR></DIV>

Left Goblin Ears</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Captain Bosec will pay between 1 and
5 gold for each left goblin ear you turn over to him. You also get 4 or 5
faction adjustments (all positive but one), and a small amount of experience. He
generally stands close to the entrance of the cellars, near the
bank.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020290"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading178"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Library Book</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on
the top floor of the temple of divine light in Erudin, he will tell you to fetch
a book from the library. This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep
Quest. The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top
floor knows the person who last checked it out. When you ask him, he tells you
that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he
was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state. He tells you to go talk to
his sister who is in the Erudin Palace. Once there, she says to meet her just
outside the hotel in town to talk to her. When you meet her, she explains that
her brother is still alive. Her brother is at Crows (It seems he is sick and is
in need of some Erud's Tonic. This is a side quest). Ask him about The Testament
of Vanear. He says yes he has it and will sell it to me for 2 gold. If you give
him the 2 gold he gives you the book which has to inventory slots and a combine
button in it. He then laughs and tells you that a thief stole pages 30 and 34
and the book is worthless without them. He also says that the thief sold the
pages to someone named Ran. If you then ask him who Ran is he tells you that Ran
Flamespinner is a librarian in Highpass. If you go to Highpass and ask about The
Testament of Vanear he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named
Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the
uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he
could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell
it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see
a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden
camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dyllin Starsine. Kill
him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the
Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport). Beware that any smugglers around him will
come to his aid. Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard,
+Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers) The
faction hits for him are pretty lagre, so be aware after that of potentially
slipping to KOS in Qeynos. After going back to Qeynos, I went back to Moodoro
and said I want page 34. He said ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty
smart of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I
get it because the work is fiction anyway. He then offers to play a game with
you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a
jester he will give you the page. Along with the jester, you might also draw the
King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight. [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the
dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward]. Once the whole thing is combined you
get the <I>Testament of Vanear</I> which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and
is a no drop lore item. You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return
the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum. (NOTE: I am
told that you can avoid Erudin completely by giving Moodoro Finharn 2gp (the
same guy that you get page 34 from) and he gives you the 2-slot book of the
testament of Vanear. Once you get the book, you can combine the page you get
from Moodoro (by playing his card game) and the other page from Dylin in
HighHold Pass and you've got the book! No need to go to Erudia. And because
Moodoro sometimes hangs out at one of the sewer entrances, evil races could
sneak in and get the book, too.)</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020291"></A><BR></DIV>

The Lottery Ticket</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In East Freeport go into Hallard's
Resales (located in the "bad" part of E Freeport behind the import store) and
talk to Tohsan Hallard. He will tell you about his special deal - bring him 4
orc pawn picks (dropped by those pesky Deathfist Pawns in West Freeport and the
Commonlands) and he will give you 5sp and a Highpass Hold Lottery Ticket. If you
give him 4 orc pawn picks (not stacked) he gives you a few silver and a Highpass
Hold Lottery Ticket (NO DROP and LORE ITEM), which he tells you is a non-winning
ticket from last year's lottery. You get the following faction changes for
turning in the picks: Coalition of Tradesfolk, Knights of Truth, Merchants of
Qeynos and Coalition of Tradesfolk III all go up, and no factions go down. Take
your new lottery ticket to Highkeep to the basement near the bank. Apparantly,
you randomly get different tickets each time you do this. Go talk to the person
near the bank (not the banker) about something like the "highkeep lottery" and
he will send you to talk to Casino Treasurer Lynn who is nearby. The treasurer
says that last year's winner never came forward, but gives the winning ticket
number and says something about it being a person from Freeport. Some tickets
get you nothing, some are a "runner-up" and gets you a few coins and tiny amount
of XP. If the winning number that he gives you is on one of the tickets, you get
the key to the Royal Suite on the 3rd floor, a nodrop lore item. There is a
locked door on the third floor, opened it with a key, and where you will find a
skeleton named "Tearon Bleanix" who responds to questions about "Princess
Lenya". It may be that this is the new quest for the <I>Thex Dagger</I> since
the old one doesn't seem to function any more, although the beginnings of this
quest were around before the patch that nerfed the dagger quest.

Princess Lenya [New Version]<A NAME="_Toc476020294"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest starts in Felwithe. It is
very long and involved, and results in a relatively weak item for all the effort
you need to put into it. The parts are actually better than the quest as a
whole. The Felwithe Paladin guildmaster, Tynkale, will ask you if you are "ready
to serve the Clerics of Tunare" if you hail him. Say "I am ready to serve the
Clerics of Tunare" and he will ask if you are new to this or experienced
(something to that degree). If you say you are inexperienced, you get the Tandan
Nybright quest. However, if you say you have been with them for awhile (or
whatever [xxxx] line equates to that) he will give you a quest to go to
Innothule Swamp and slay Jojoojojgogogoguna, the long-named huge Kobold lord in
the aptly named Jojongua's Tower. He is a rare spawn and drops a pelt called a
Very Large Hide. Take his pelt to Tynkale for xp, faction and an item. The
following factions go up: Clerics of Tunare, King Teristhex and antimage. He
will then ask you to meet up with a man named Tolon Nurbyte in Highkeepand tell
him the key phrase "The glory of Mother shines bright". He is found at a local
inn, and will spawn if you ask the innkeeper who is Tolon Nurbyte. Tell him the
phrase and he will tell you to go to highkeep and tell Tearon Bleanix "All is
not bright above the clouds". </FONT><BR></DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>To get to Tearon you need a lottery
ticket. In East Freeport go into Hallard's Resales (located in the "bad" part of

will give you a bracer and tell you to take to the Highpass Hussy. This
colorfully named person is in fact Mistress Anna on floor 4; who tells you to
seek out Tylani and Marlin (she tells you to kill him; but you dont have to).
You do need to kill Tylani. She drops a fishfood container. Mix in it 3 fairy
dusts and 1 sand of ro to make fish food. Find marlin in the Rooster Inn in
Highpass. He is upstairs in the last room on the left. He will ask for a silk
evening gown found in qeynos. Bring him the gown and you will get a key. Now, go
to lake rathetear and find the "royal fish" Feed the royal fish the final fish
food product, and it turns out that it was in fact Princess Lenya Thex. Give the
princess the bracer and the marlin key and she then gives you an amulet. Now go
back to Tearon Bleanix and give him the amulet and the highpass key #3 and for
ALL this effort you get a paladin only shield called "Shield of the Silent
Watch" [AC10 wis +10]. </FONT><BR></DIV>

Princess Lenya [OLD VERSION]</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>[I am keeping this description here
in case it ever changes back, but this version of the quest is no longer valid].
In the top of High keep is a Princess Lenya. The information I have been given
on this is confusing, but several people have told me that it does in fact work.
The princess of Felwithe has been taken prisoner by Carson McCabe (ruler of
Highhold Keep). She would like you to help her escape - a reasonable request.
First, visit a Tearon. He is located near the front of the Keep. Say "I want to
be a hero." Pay close attention to the name of his princess. Next, seek out the
REAL Princess. She is located on the top floor of Highhold Keep, behind an
illusionary picture frame wall at the top of the stairs. Hail her and give her
the bracer you got from Tearon. When you give it to the Princess (as proof), she
says thanks, vanishes (for about half a second), and you get XP and the
following faction: KingTearisThex (Felwithe King)+, FaydarkChampions+,
MayongMistmoore-, RingofScale-, KingAythoxThex- (???...hmm, could this be
continuing somewhere?). She also gives you the bracer, which is now AC 1 but
which still can't be worn. This is where you need a friend to help you. When
your friend gives the bracer back to Tearon, you get more xp, and this faction:
ClericsofTunare+, KingTearisThex+, Anti-Mage+. The princess should then appear
next to him. Give her the amulet from Tearon she will thank you and give you a
letter to take to Tolon Nurbyte, in the only inn in Felwithe. Apparantly, the
important thing is that the two people hand over the bracers in rapid
succession. That is, the moment the bracer is handed to the princess upstairs,
the other bracer has to be handed to the elf downstairs before she respawns a
second later. The method I have been told to use is to wait to see the "you have
gained party experience" message and then hand the bracer to Tearon. If done
properly, she'll appear downstairs and stand there for a few minutes. She won't
spawn at all downstairs unless it's done nearly simultaneously. Since getting
the bracers is basically free, I would suggest you keep experimenting until you
get the right combination. Your reward for the bringing him the letter is a
<I>Thex Dagger</I>. (If you give the bracer to the fake Princess, in the
basement near the prisoners, she reveals herself to be a dark elf, and gives the
following faction: CarsonMcCabe+, CoalitionofTradesfolk+, HighpassGuards+,
MerchantsofHighpass+, RingofScale-, but no XP. She then attacks you, so you have
better be careful). This quest is not faction dependent. As long as they will
talk to you you are fine. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020295"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading183"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
The Silent Watch</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This seems to be the beginning of a
complex quest. At the end of the Princess Lenyaquest Tolon Nurbyte mentions
something about a 'you might be worthy of the Silent Watch after all.' Ask him
'what is the silent watch?' and he says 'The Silent Watch was established in the
early days of Felwithe. King Tearis Thex had many cruel deeds to do. The regular
Paladins were too righteous to carry out any of the necessary missions and we
dare not bring in the Feir'Dal, after all, some of the operations were against
Kelethin. King Tearis formed our group. Koada'Dal not of prim and proper
breeding. Now we act as a secret guard and report only to him. I don't know if
that leads anywhere here or in Felwithe.</FONT><BR></DIV>
