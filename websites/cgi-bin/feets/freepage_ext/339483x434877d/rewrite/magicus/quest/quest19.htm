Aviak Chicks</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>It would appear that the aviaks have
been defecating on the huge dwarf statue over the entrance to Kaladim and the
dwarf paladins are VERY upset about it. Bumle Reminjar, in Underfoot Hall, will
reward you for every 4 aviak chick talons you bring him. Oddly enough, they are
found on Crag chicks in Butcherblock. You will increase faction with Clerics of
Underfoot, Kazon Stormhammer, and Miners Guild 249.

Aviak Talons</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Bumle Reminjar will also reward you
for every 4 aviak talons (from the harder krag elders) you bring him. you will
get some money and an item, often rawhide or leather.

Bone Chips</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Gunlok Jure in the paladin's
guild and he will send you out to collect bone chips. Give him 4 bone chips
(stacked will do). You will get experience, guild faction and some money. Note
that you must be given this quest to complete it. Players with low faction will
not get anything by giving him bone chips. You will increase faction with
Clerics of Underfoot, Kazon Stormhammer and Miners Guild 249. After enough
times, he may give you another quest.

Blyle Bundin's head</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This starts in Kaladim next to the
"pit" or arena in front of the warriors guild. The guy standing on the rim asks
you to hunt down and kill a guard Bundin that deserted his post. He wants you to
bring back his head and his axe. he can be usually (but not always) found
between the lonely guard outside the docks and the ruins with the elf vendor and
two quarelling guards. He is around level 7, but hits much harder than his
level, so watch out (I have been told you may sometimes loot a fine steel weapon
off of him). Also, if you attack him near any guards, they may come to his
rescue. Kill him and turn in his head and axe for experience, faction, a small
amount of money and sometimes an item. Killing him will lower your faction with
the Kaladim Residents, so beware of doing this too many times. You must turn in
both the head and the axe. When you do, you will get the following faction
changes: increase with Storm Guard, Kazon Stormhammer, Miners Guild 249 and
Merchants of Kaladim, and decrease with Craknek Warriors.

Cleaner Clockwork</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Killing the Clockwork "CleanerVII"
gives you two options. Jeet, one of the rogue trainers in Kaladim next to the
bank, asks you to do the special task of "ridding him of that infernal Cleaner"
and says he will give you a "Miner's Cap" if you do it. The Cleaner clockwork is
sometimes found near the bank in Kaladim. Kill it and return the pieces for your
<I>Miner's Cap 628</I> (only wearable by Dwarf Rogues). Alternatively, return
the dead body (black box fragments) to Beno Tenarl for experience and faction
and the Knight Card or Eye of Stormguard Quest.

<A NAME="Heading195"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Cromil's Remains</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is sometimes given to you
after you return 4 bone chips to the paladin in the guild hall in Kaladim. He
will ask you to find the remains of his brother Cromil. Supposedly he is now
undead and is with an undead army located somewhere in the Plains of Karana. You
can find these remains in the Southern Plains of Karana. Cromil is not actually
a creature that is listed. It turns out that after you kill a Putrid Skeleton in
the camp where Lord Grimrot hangs out, one of them might have a set of Dwarven
Bones. These are in fact Cromil's remains. Upon returning them to the paladin in
the Kaladim guildhall, he rewards you with some cash and a spell. Be warned that
the location is in a very dangerous location, as many of the creatures there are
well into the upper teens in level. Especially beware of the roaming cyclops and
Lord Grimrot, who is in fact the subject of another quest.

<A NAME="Heading196"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Eye of Stormhammer</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest for the <I>Avenger
Battle Axe</I>. After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner clockwork quest)
to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him "what important stormguard matter". He will
give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank of High Pass keep. Of
course the prisoner has escaped but she does give you part of the eye of
stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has the other part, the "Emerald
Shard". Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in Rivervale and sometimes near the
southern tower in Misty Thicket. When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he
says he will give it to you if you do a small favor. Apparently a bounty hunter
by the name of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body,
he will give you the emerald. Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket. He
appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)! He hops around between the Orc
camp and the wall. You may have to talk to Bronin to get him to spawn. If you
defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore item), a few gold, and the following
faction adjustments: Frogloks of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of
Kurnak and Iskar get better. When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells
you that he put the emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives
you a key to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold. The key is labeled
H.K.106. Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and
the following faction adjustments: Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands,
Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of River
Vale gets worse. When you turn in the key in highpass bank, you get the emerald
shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the following adjustments:
Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson McCabe all get better. Bronin
also says "There is a [second Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will
need it..." Upon further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the
Gem of Tunare, and is being held by a guild in Kelethin. In Kelethin, go to the
Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about the
Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The only one
who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting "at the lake
near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to Dagnor's Cauldron
and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his brother is a thief (and
only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone to Qeynos, probably to work
for the thieves guild there. Faldor Hendrys is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he
can be found walking out the front gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills
zone sometimes. He may also sometimes be found in Crows Tavern. You need to kill
him to get the gem. Combine the parts and you get the eye of stormguard, which
gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection. If you give it to Beno, he gives
you a long speach about how wonderful a warrior you are and says he is giving
you a "warrior's true weapon designed by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl
Mizebrite." He then will give you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice
warrior only 2HS weapon. It is likely that you need to have a very high faction
with him to get the axe. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020309"></A><BR></DIV>

Tenarle, he will give you a knight card which he would like you to return to the
smith, Doran Vargnus. Doran Vargnus is one of the dwarven smiths shipwrecked on
the Island of Erollisi. The island is located in the Ocean of Tears between
Kaladim and Freeport. The dwarves are camped in a small tent on the southeast
corner of the island. (LOC: 1280 -9245) Complete the quest by giving the knight
card to Doran. He gives you an item for the card which ranges from cloth to some
pretty nice armor pieces such as blackened and bronze, and even dwarven mail.

to earn your <I>Mining Puck 628</I> (a weapon useable only by dwarf rogues) and
he tells you to return to him the head of Boog Mudtoe. Boog is on the island
directly west of the Erollisi (all girl) Island in the Ocean of Tears. He's an
ogre in the upper teens, and is tough to kill. You need to bring his head and
300 gp back to Mater in order to get your pick.

it. You have to go to the Butcherblock port and talk to the girl on the end and
she'll tell you to find the two remaining Mudtoes, Boog and Goob, in the Sea of
Tears. You will find one named Boog Mudtoe (lev 17) on the island right across
from the all girl island of Erollisi. You kill him and get his head and a note
that is to his brother. His brother is on the island with Gornit the Giant. He
is a shaman and casts root a lot, so you have to be careful attacking him. Take
their heads back to Furtog for a decent item (sometimes an <I>Ogre War Maul</I>)
and the Trumpy Irontoe quest. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020315"></A><BR></DIV>

Orc Belts</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Turn in orc belts to Canloe Nusbeck
in the warrior's guild for experience, faction and minor money and items. You
can turn in as many as four at at a time. The general consensus is that four
items will just be treated like giving one item four times, so it is just a time
saving device. You can find these by killing orcs in Crushbone. Faction changes
are as follows: + Stormguard, + Merchants of Kaladim, + Miners Guild 249, +Kazon
Stormhammer, - Cracknek Warriors. [Faction adjustments may have been changed in
a recent patch]

Ogre Head<A NAME="_Hlt476366398"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In the warrior guild in Kaladim
there is a dwarf male named Byzar Bloodforge. He is looking for the heads of the
ogres Zarchoomi and Corflunk who roam the countryside of Butcherblock. If you
ask Byzar "What about Corflunk?" He responds with, don't mention those names, I
hate those ogres and would pay handsomely for their heads. He does the same if
you ask about Zarchoomi. You must give him both heads, and then he will say he
underestimated you and give you experience, faction, some coin and a decent item
(This used to be blackened mail, but now you seem to only get various pieces of
bloodforge mail, which generally has the same stats, but can only be worn by
dwarf clerics, paladins or warriors). One nice piece of bloodforge mail you
might get is a <I>Bloodforge Helm</I>. Your faction with Stormguard, Kazon
Stormhammer, MinersGuild 249 and Merchants of Kaladim will all get better, and
your faction with CrakenkWarriors gets worse. You need a decent faction with him
to finish the quest (probably amiable). He will then give you the Trumpy Irontoe
Quest. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020317"></A><BR></DIV>

Orc Legionnaire Shoulder Pads</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Turn these in to Canloe Nusbeck in
Kaladim. As with the orc belts, you can find these by killing orcs in Crushbone.
You can turn in as many as four at at a time. I have been told that you have a
chance at a better item with two at a time, but that more than two will not
help. I am not sure if that is true or not. You now need at least two to get
something. As of now, you can turn these in even if your faction is too low for
him to actually give you the quest. You will get some decent weapons (sometimes
even bronze ones worth several pp each) and items for these. Faction changes are
as follows: + Stormguard, + Merchants of Kaladim, + Miners Guild 249, +Kazon

small worker scarabs in butcherblock and the pristine scarab carapace can be
found on Death Beetles in Unrest or possibly on giant scarabs (rarely). Once you
get your faction high enough, he will also create <I>Scarab Boots</I> for you.

Trumpy Irontoe</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After you give Byzar Bloodforge the
two ogre heads in the ogre head quest, he asks if you'd be willing to take a
little trip. If you say you will, he tells you about Trumpy Irontoe. He says he
doesn't know where he is, but that he had been engaged to his sister and ran off
on her. He wants his head for this affront to the family honor and promises to
make you an honorary member of the Bloodforge Brigade for returning the head.
Trumpy hangs out at the Fish's Ale in Qeynos. Your reward for this quest is
usually a bloodforge hammer, a very nice 2HB magical weapon. The secret to
killing Trumpy is you have to get him away from Barstomper. In order to do this
you ask him in the bar about Sragg. He then gets all puffy and walks out. If you
follow him he will get quite a ways from the bar. You can then safely attack and
kill him. Be warned he will run away so a good root spell or snare is a good
idea. Also, he is in good with the corrupt guards and they might help him if
they see him getting attacked. Do not chase him either he will come back if you
let him and enventually he will run back by barstomper and then you have a much
bigger fight on your hands. You must have a good faction in order to be able to
get the hammer. Trumpy's head is now a no trade/no drop item, so you can't give
it to a dwarf to get the hammer, but must raise your own faction to get it. If
you hail him first he will tell you about some beads. If you ask him about the
beads you will know if you have a good faction. He may say that your shifty eyes
tell him you are not good and in that case you do not. If you do then you can
give him the head and he will give you the <I>Bloodforge Hammer</I>. Completing
this quest will give the following faction changes: increase with Storm Guard,
Kazon Stormhammer, Miners Guild 249 and Merchants of Kaladim, and decrease with
Craknek Warriors. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020325"></A><BR></DIV>

Tumpy Tonics</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Note that this quest is needed to
finish the Trueshot longbow quest in Kelethin and for a quest in Solusek Ro. A
dwarf named something Everhot who hangs around in front the Kaladim bank and
walks up and down the mine hallways very quickly will talk to you if you hail
him a few times. He tells you he's in a hurry with working on his Dwarven Wire.
When you ask about the wire, he tells you he'll give you some if you get him two
Tumpy Tonics from Tumpy Irontoe. Trumpy can be found at a building in Kaladim on
the right just before the hallway where you zone to the bank called Irontoe
eats. (there is also a Trumpy Irontoe in Qeynos who supposedly can fulfill this
quest). There is no identifying sign on the door or anything, but when you walk
in you'll see him standing behind a counter. Hail him and he'll say "....if you
don't see something, ask me and perhaps I can make it" or something to that
effect. Ask him, "Make me a Tumpy Tonic?" and he'll tell you that he can make
them, but that he needs kiola nuts and flasks of water, and that Kiola nuts can
be found in the island chain in the Sea of Tears. After much asking about, you
find that the island you need to visit is the Island of the Sisterhood of
Eollisi. When you get there, find the vendor that sells kiola nuts, purchase
your Kiola nuts, and go back to Kaladim. Be VERY careful if you are going to
fight anybody here, everybody is strong! In Kaladim, give Tumpy the nuts and
flasks of water and he'll give you Tumpy Tonics. Take the Tumpy Tonics back down
to the dwarf Everhot, give them to him, and he'll give you a spool of dwarven
wire. The wire can be used for the trueshot longbow quest. </FONT><BR></DIV>
