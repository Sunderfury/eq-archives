Dorn's Business</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you Hail Dorn B'Dynn (assuming
you are evil and not kos, or are under an evil illusion), he will ask you if you
want to Attend to Business, or if you are Seeking Shelter. If you tell him you
want to attend to business, he asks you who sent you. Tell him Zimbittle sent
you. He then asks for a password, which is Mukk. He then gives you a letter to
take to Kragia of Da Basher's in Grobb, and warns you that the note must not
fall into the hands of Goonda, else the whole plan would get disrupted. The
letter tells them to raid the Ogre encampment in WK, where a traitor will take
the crystal shard from the stone and return it to Neriak. It also mentions that
Marda may have sent an agent. I have been told that a person under illusion
troll and benevolence only got the usual thanks response when he game Kragia the
letter, so that may not be the real next step. He also tried to give the letter
to Zimbittle and Doogna, but also got no response. Chief Goonda in WK also does
not respond to the letter. It may be that you have to be a troll to complete it,
or the quest just may be broken. </FONT><BR></DIV>
