Bracers of Erollisi</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Styria Fearnon will tell you that
the pirate captain has stolen the Bracers of Erollisi. Return them for a
faction, experience some gold and a minor item. The factions which change are as
follows: Faydark's Champions, King Tearisthex, Clerics of Tunare and Soldiers of
Tunare get better and Crushbone Orcs gets worse. Basically the bracers are worth
more than the reward. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020408"></A><BR></DIV>

HEHE meat</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest to get the
<I>Grobb Cleaver</I>. It starts in Grobb (of course). Talk to Carver, by the
Shaman's guild, and he will tell you he wants 3 pieces of a meat called "HEHE
meat" and the recipe to make it. You can purchase the meat in Oggok from Dooga
the Ogre Chef. (He has a seperate quest to deliver froglock legs). The recipe is
held by the Gobbler in Neriak. If you talk to the Gobbler about the recipe, he
will send you to deliver a Grub Locker of Dwarf Pickles to his Troll friend in
the Ocean of Tears, Nerbilik. You need to make the delivery. Nerbilik is fishing
on the Siren rocks. Be careful, since I have been told the guards may kill you
even though they con indifferent. Give him the locker and you will receive
approximately 1 plat, increased faction with DaBashers and decreased faction
with BrokenSkull Clan, and some xp. However, he will refuse to give you the
recipe he has, so you need to kill him and loot it from his corpse. This
seriously decreases your troll faction. Then take the recipe and 3 HEHE meats
back to Carver and he will give you a Grobb Cleaver for you efforts.

Knight Cards</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After you kill the gnomish clockwork
"Cleaner VII" which wanders Northern Kaladim and return his remains to Beno
Tenarle, he will give you a knight card which he would like you to return to the
smith, Doran Vargnus. Doran Vargnus is one of the dwarven smiths shipwrecked on
the Island of Erollisi. The island is located in the Ocean of Tears between
Kaladim and Freeport. The dwarves are camped in a small tent on the southeast
corner of the island. (LOC: 1280 -9245) Complete the quest by giving the knight
card to Doran. He gives you an item for the card which ranges from cloth to some
pretty nice armor pieces such as blackened and bronze, and even dwarven mail.

The Mudtoes</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Furtog Ogrebane in Kaladim will tell
you that his father killed a whole tribe of ogres (the Mudtoes) except for two
that got away. Then he tells you to go to the docks in BB and find more info on
it. You have to go to the Butcherblock port and talk to the girl on the end and
she'll tell you to find the two remaining Mudtoes, Boog and Goob, in the Sea of
Tears. You will find one named Boog Mudtoe (lev 17) on the island right across
from the all girl island of Erollisi. You kill him and get his head and a note
that is to his brother. His brother is on the island with Gornit the Giant. He
is a shaman and casts root a lot, so you have to be careful attacking him. Take
their heads back to Furtog for a decent item and the Trumpy Irontoe quest.

Pirate Earrings</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Styria Fearnon on Eriollisi will
give a quest to return pirate earrings to her for a minor item, a few coins, and
faction adjustments. The pirates are on another island. When you submit the
earrings, you get the following faction adjustments: Faydarks champions, King
teristhes, clerics of tunare, and soldiers of tunare go up and crushbone orcs go
down. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020412"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading326"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Sentry Xyrin</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Somewhere in the Ocean of Tears
there is an undead island (rough loc of -604.96, -7343.81). The island is
populated by a few greater skeletons, a couple gargoyles, and four specters.
There you will find stranded a female paladin named Sentry Xyrin. She will spawn
if you ask one of the Sisters at Eriolissi Isle "Where is Xrin". She mentions
that she was part of a [boat disaster] and that she is from the temple of Marr
in Freeport. She will ask you to get her a [Potion of Marr] from Serna Tasknon
is the Temple of Marr in Freeport. With the potion she will be able to regain
her strength and take on the undead. (You can also initiate this quest by first
speaking to someone in the Temple of Marr, getting the potion, and from that
point on learning of Sentry Xyrin's location and going to look for her, which is
actually the way most people would discover the quest). You have to get the
bottle from the Temple of Marr and then bring the bottle to all the 8 guards in
alphabetical order. The guards and the order are as follows: ANDLIN (Walks
around outside wall); BORIS (Downstairs stationary); GALLIUS (Outside by front
door); JANEAL (Downstairs stationary); MEIGHAN (Outside by front door); THEO
(Patrols inside on upper levels); WARREN (Patrols inside on lower levels); XYRIN
(final sentry in OoT). It seems that if your faction is not high enough you
can't get the bottle. When you give it to the last person (not including Xyrin)
he will tell you that she went to the Sisterhood of Erolisi. The sisters will
tell you she is either dead or stranded on a nearby island. Then go to the
island where she is stranded and give the bottle to her. She will give it back
to you to take back to the temple, after which you will be done. Then she will
tell you she intends to take on the undead on the island and race up and attack
the spectres and die. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020413"></A><BR></DIV>

Sentry Xyrin, Part Two</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you ask Sentry Xryn the potion
described in the above quest, or if you say to her what potion of Marr, she will
soon rush up the hill to take on the spectres. Unfortunately, she is not
powerful enough to defeat them alone. If you keep them off of her long enough to
keep her alive for 15 minutes, she will stand there for a while and then drop
the <I>Deepwater Harpoon</I>. You can use any number of methods to keep the
spectres off of her from killing them to charm/mez, etc. One interesting point I
have been told is that if you kill off the spectres before she charges up the
hill and they then reappear, they will not attack her and she will still drop
the Harpoon. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020414"></A><BR></DIV>

Tome of Ages</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Since another part of this quest
became active, it is possible that the whole quest now works. This very high
level quest starts on the Island of the Isle Goblins across from the Isle of the
Sisterhood of Erollisi. Talk to the Oracle of K'Arnon. He asks if you seek
knowledge or offer something. Either way, you get to what he seeks: The Tome of
Ages written by the Scribes of Dal. This is a group of dark elves who broke the
tomb into seven(?) separate pieces, perhaps to keep it from the oracle. Asking
about the Scribes, he says that if he knew where they were, he would not be
asking you to find them. It seems that you need to find the pieces and combine
them to re-form the Tome of Ages. The following books need to be found:

<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The <I>Book
of Turmoil</I> can be found through a quest based in Neriak. When given back to
the Oracle of K'Arnon, yields a Glowing Torch (a nice item for enchanters), a
bit of exp and the following factions adjustments: Oracle of K'Arnon goes up,
Oracle of Marud goes down.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The
Book of Scale: This drops in two halves. Each half drops from a dragon: One from
Nagafen and one from Vox. To assemble the completed book, one must bring the two
halves to the female barkeep in the Blind Fish Tavern in Neriak. She offers to
'put together' the book for 1000pp. She also says she can restore the other
books when you find them, leaving me to think the others are dropped in similar
fashion.
