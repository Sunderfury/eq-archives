Paladin Message</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Theron Rolius, in the Hall of Truth,
standing next to the paladin guildmaster in the rear raised section, is the
person who initiates this quest. He asks you to meet a messenger named Mojax
Hikspin "near a lake in the Commonlands". When found in West Commonlands, he is
usually sitting next to the fisherman on the lake - the one that won't talk or
sell to you. He needs a flask of milk, which you can get from the office of the
people or at Greenleaf's in Freeport. As soon as you give him the milk, he
starts to hand you a note, but a fast NPC named Duggin Scumper comes by, insults
the Freeport king or something, and runs off, yelling that You'll never catch
him, and that he's taking this to his superior in the Quenos Royal hall or
something. In order to get the note, you have to attack the man, kill him (he's
around level 3 or 4) and loot his corpse to find the note. Then you return the
note to Eeyana Neastra, a sentry on the top level of the temple of Marr (she may
be in the Hall of Truth now). He is very tough to catch without magic. However,
sometimes if you stop chasing him and return to Mojax, he will walk down the
path to a pillar and drop the note for you there. Each time you give Mojax milk,
you restart the sequence so that you can try again if you mis the first time.
You get a little gold, a item (sometimes a potion), experience, and increased
faction standing with the Knights of Truth. (Submitted by Saidan)

Reserve Militia</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Armorer Delin in the
Freeport Militia House and he will ask you to show him your reserve militia
token. If you don't have one, he tells you to go talk to Guard Valorn out at the
tollbooth in West Commonlands. Valorn gives out the 4 orc picks quest then will
give you the bracketed keyword for the next quest. Which is to bring 8 cutthroat
rings combined in a bag he gives you. Give him that and he gives you a reserve
militia tolken, which when you give that to Armorer Delin in the militia house
results in a  <I>Reserve Militia Tunic</I>. After giving you the tunic, the
Armorer tells you to be careful of north freeport. Coalition of TradefolkIII,
and Freeport Militia go up. Knighhts of Truth and Mithaniel Marr go down.
