Cromil's Remains</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is sometimes given to you
after you return 4 bone chips to the paladin in the guild hall in Kaladim. He
will ask you to find the remains of his brother Cromil. Supposedly he is now
undead and is with an undead army located somewhere in the Plains of Karana. You
can find these remains in the Southern Plains of Karana. Cromil is not actually
a creature that is listed. It turns out that after you kill a Putrid Skeleton in
the camp where Lord Grimrot hangs out, one of them might have a set of Dwarven
Bones. These are in fact Cromil's remains. Upon returning them to the paladin in
the Kaladim guildhall, he rewards you with some cash and a spell. Be warned that
the location is in a very dangerous location, as many of the creatures there are
well into the upper teens in level. Especially beware of the roaming cyclops and
Lord Grimrot, who is in fact the subject of another quest.

<A NAME="Heading602"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Lord Grimlot's Love</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest no longer results in the
Electrum-Bladed Wakizashi. I am not sure what if anything you get for this. Lord
Grimlot tells you about his poor, misguided beloved Arlena, who has run away
from him to Mistmoore castle. Being the sentimental type, he wants you to track
down the lass, kill her and return her either the lute of the gypsy or her
bones. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020596"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading603"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Monks of the Whistling Fist</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>It is likely that you need to be a
tailor to do this. Brother Qwinn in Southern Karana seeks the return of the code
of the whistling fist, which was stolen by him. It is dropped by Targin the
Rock, a rare spawn in the Sol B throne room. Bring him the Code and a purple
silent fist headband and you will get a special needle. Brother Zephyl in Rathe
Mountains wants the Idol of Zan Fi, which is in the possession of Brother
Raster, who spawns in the Mino Elders room in Lower Guk. Returning this Idol,
plus a red sash, results in a special tailoring pattern. These two items need to
be combined in a sewing kit with a swatch of shadow silk (tailored) and a Scroll
of Jonathans Whistling Warsong, which is bought from the Bards Guild, to make a
monk only item called the <I>Robe of the Lost Circle</I>.

<A NAME="Heading604"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Trumpy Irontoe's Skull</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After bringing the head of Trumpy
Irontoe to the Necro Guildmaster in Qeynos, he will cast a spell on it and hand
you back his fleshless skull to deliver to Lord Grimrot, who is supposed to be
in a field of skeletons somewhere in the Plains. Grimrot is located in South
Karana, surrounded by some tough and dangerous skeletons. You may have to wait a
while for him to show up so be prepared to fight or hide. The delivery of the
skull will get you a decent amount of experience and gold, as well as an
occasional nice item. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020598"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading605"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Winds of Karana</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is another of the multiple part
quests. When heading into Southern Karana, from Northern Karana mind you, there
is a tower just before the bridge. Just outside the tower doors are four very
large horn like structures. Standing beside one is a female bard. If you talk to
her, and ask if there is anything you can do for her, she relays a sad story of
a hermit who stole her flute. Now, head into Southern Karana. Head straight
south, making sure to give a wide berth to the Grave Yard of Lord Grimrot. About
half way through the zone is a fountain, with Vhalen standing there. Vhalen, who
is also the object of the broken Lute quest for bards, has an offer for you. He
will complete his latest masterpiece for you. Of course, he needs something for
this. Two sheets of a song. Pages 1 and 2 of the Winds of Karana. He tells you
of a man who has stolen these pages. A vile man of a Hermit. Sound familiar eh?
Now, head southeast till you see a cottage. It has a hexagonal wall of stone
surrounding it, so it's not hard to find. Inside the walls is "a hermit." A very
unfriendly sort. Here's where the quests takes one of two paths. The door to the
hermits house is either locked, or broken and won't open. So it's hard to get to
him. If you slide past the door slowly you may be able to see him and target
him. Now, if you want to talk to him, you can go behind the house, stand EXACTLY
against the chimney that protrudes and banter with him. He's very hard to
convince to talk, and the sentence basically has to say something to the effect
of "where is the flute" though this isn't the exact wording, (I got it right
once out of 6 attempts) Now, if you do talk to him, he has twoquests you can
achieve from him (More on these later) in which you kill two people and bring
proof to him for the Flute and the Page. Now, as it's hard to get through the
door, and thus hard to exchange the items to him, there is ONE other manner to
do this quest. Target him, as before, and begin an attack. Spells will draw him
out just fine. After he is dead, his body will contain the Flute, Page 1 of the
Winds of Karana or just one or the other. At this point, some factions will go
up, down and you will no doubt gain some good experience. I estimate him to be
around level 20. Now, head back into Northern Karana, and hand the flute over to
the bard sitting against the pillar. She, as thanks, will give you Page 2 of the
winds of Karana, some experience, faction and occasionally a small cash reward.
You are almost complete. Head back into Southern Karana and hand both the pages
to Vhalen at the same time. You will gain Faction, a small amount of money, and
a Bard song. This song appears to be random. I got the 3rd song, another got the
4th song. </FONT><BR></DIV>
