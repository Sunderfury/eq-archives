The Assassin</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is sometimes given to you
after you complete the Nitrates quest in Surefall Glades. Return to surefall and
give the note to Gerael for status and few coins. Gerael returns the note to you
and asks you to give it to Captain Tillim in Qeynos. He asks you to also to warn
the target (Gash Flockwaller) that [They are Trying to kill him]. Go to Qeynos
and give the note to Captain Tillim. You are rewarded with some faction and told
that Gash stays in the Lion's head INN. Going to the Lion's head inn. Gash
Flockwaller should be in a back room during the day. Talking to him and
repeating the key phrase as [they are trying to kill you] gives you a clue about
the unkempt druids - that they carry [black wood chips]. Somewhere in this the
Assassin will attack - his name is Raffel Minnmorn. At this point the quest may
be broken. One time I beat the assassin with Gash's assistance - as a result the
body dissappeared and I couldn't loot it; the second time I got a ranger/druid
mob together and we splatted him, but since I hadn't gotten the wood chip
comment yet all that I got from him was a rusty dagger. Raffel con's black to a
10th level ranger, but he has a slew of druid spells and shouldn't be solo'd
unless you are pretty strong or lucky. So the ending is still unclear.

The Bayle List</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This a long and involved quest, and
can be started in a number of different places, but revolves around Qeynos,
Surefall and Freeport. The details I was given are still unclear in spots, but
it ultimately resluts in a high powered shadowknight weapon. It involves getting
all three parts of the Bayle List. Each part can also be gotten separately for a
different reward, as listed on the separate quests. (1) For Part one of the
list, talk to Commander Kane in the Shrine of Bertoxxus in Qeynos Catecombs and
he will ask you to deliver blackburrow stout to Barn Bloodstone who is outside
the Golden Rooster in Highpass. Make sure your faction withBarn is at least
indifferent. To raise, do the Letter to Janam/Letter to Rebby quests in the East
FP. If Commander Kane doesn't talk to you at first, just Hail him and say "The
disease is spreading." Then he will bemuch more manageable. Doing so results in
part one of the list. (2) For part two of the list, you need to kill a bear. As
background, you can talk to Runethar Hamest in the Temple of Thunder, who is
investigating corruption among the guards of Qeynos. He asks you to go to
Surefall Glade, find Frenway Marthank in the Druids' Guildtree, and ask him for
"The Bayle List." When you do, Frenway is in a state of depression. His son --
who happened to be carrying the very list you're looking for -- was killed and
devoured by the great grizzly bear Mammoth, who lives deep in the caves of
Surefall Glade. As a Druid, Frenway is forbidden to harm the bears of the Glade,
but he wants vengeance. If you can find and slay Mammoth, you will get a the
Bayle list II. Basically, all you have to do is kill the bear (he is about level
20) and skip the rest. (3) For part three, talk to Raltur Caliskon in the Dismal
Rage in Freeport and he tells you to assist Sir Lucen Delere in any task he has.
But to return any interesting information to him and not Delere. Ralture will
then tell you to kill Lady Shea and get the Bayle List. However, Lady Shea will
tell you that she had the list stolen from her by Dyllin Starshine, who is bound
for Qeynos. He can be found in the smuggler's camp in Highpass. If you have a
high faction or use your influence spell on him, he will give you the list. You
can also get it by killing him, but you will take a bad faction hit from that
that might cause you to not be able to complete the final part of the quest. (4)
Take all three parts to Rathmana Allin in South Ro along with 20 gp and he will
give you back a translated list. If you give this to Pietro Zarn, the
shadowknight guildmaster in the East Freeport Sewers, he will usually reward you
with a <I>Rage War Maul</I> (you may need very high faction with him to get it -
thus you shouldn't kill Dyllin unless you started extremely high). It is
possible that this is used to obtain an even better shadowknight weapon.

Blackburrow Brewers</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After you turn in Gnasher's head to
Larsk Juton, he will sometimes say that he requires your services to [assist in
the extermination of the gnoll brewers]. If you say the magic words, he
elaborates. He tells you to go to Blackburrow to kill the gnoll brewers, and
bring back any Blackburrow Casks. "Upon your third cask I shall reward you the
[Cloak of Jaggedpine]. The casks are found on the Gnoll Master Brewers and "A
gnoll brewer" which are a rare spawn at the end of the bottom bridge by the
barrels in Blackburrow. The reward is the <I>Cloak of Jaggedpine</I> . He hints
that one should hold on to it, because "you may never know when we may alter the
enchantments placed upon the cloak."

The Bonethunder Staff</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Runethar Hamest in the Temple of
Thunder is investigating corruption among the guards of Qeynos. He asks you to
go to Surefall Glade, find Frenway Marthank in the Druids' Guildtree, and ask
him for "The Bayle List." He also tells you that if you bring him this list and
the <I>Thunder Staff</I>, he will give you a special reward. Go first to talk to
Frenway in Surefall. When you do, Frenway is in a state of depression. His son
-- who happened to be carrying the very list you're looking for -- was killed
and devoured by the great grizzly bear Mammoth, who lives deep in the caves of
Surefall Glade. As a Druid, Frenway is forbidden to harm the bears of the Glade,
but he wants vengeance. If you can find and slay Mammoth, you will get the list.
Return it and the Mammoth's hide to Frenway and he will in turn give you the
Bayle List II. There are more than a few people in Surefall Glade who will
strike you down for attacking the bears, so be very careful. Once you have the
Bayle list II, you need to get the thunderstaff. You can get this by killing
Drosco the Zombie in the Qeynos Sewers and bring the order of thunder he drops
back to Wolten Graff in the Temple of Thunder. He will give you the
thunderstaff. Take that and the Bayle list II back to Runethar, and he will
reward ytou with you very own <I>Bonethunder Staff</I>.

Gnasher's Head</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest starts in Surefall Glade.
Talk to Larsk Juton who has some sort of feud with a gnoll named Gnasher. Too
lazy to do it himself I guess, he wants you to kill his enemy for him. This
gnoll occasionally appears in Qeynos Hills and is around level 10 or so. Kill
him and bring his head back to Lars and you will get some cash and the
Blackburrow Brewers Quest (Surefall). Sometimes when you kill Gnasher Furrgutt,
he is carrying a note from the bartender at Fish's Ale which you can turn in to
the authorities. First, give the note to Larsk Juton (the same person you give
Gnasher's head to). Note that you cannot shortcut this by giving the note to
Captain Tillian directly. He will give you some experience and a faction
adjustment, and advise you to take the note to Captain Tillian in the Arena in
Qeynos (the same one you give Gnoll Fangs to). Captain Tillian will give you
more experience, more faction adjustments, and a Medal of Merit (a Lore Item
which gives you +5 Charisma) for your good deeds. He will then summon the
Executioner, who will proceed to Fish's Ale to carry out the sentence of death
pronounced on the unwise bartender. Follow the executioner and watch the fun.
Another note. If you are carrying gnoll fangs for Captain Tillian, give them to
him and go collect the blackburrow stout first, since the executioner will kill
your stout connection and he won't respawn for a while.

Gnoll Paws<A NAME="_Toc476020612"></A></H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In Surefall Glade, Corun Finisc, the
same person who gives the Jaggedpine Crook staff quest, if asked about "gnolls"
will reply that the Sabertooths are viscious gnolls of Blackburrow who attack
them constantly and send patrols out into Qeynos Hills and a gnoll has even been
seen in the bear caves on occasion! He then says, "There is a [reward] for his
hide." If you ask "What reward?", he will reply, "Yes. We are offering a small
reward for slaying the stalking gnoll in the bear caves. Bring us his Paw to
claim your bounty. The Jaggedpine Treefolk remember well those who aid their
cause." You need to slay the gnoll in the cave and return his paw as proof. Paws
from other gnolls, such as Blackburrow and Butcherblock, will not work. I am not
positive what you get for this quest. </FONT><BR></DIV>

Going Postal</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is a massive quest involving
most of the cities in Norrath. See the full quest description in Ak'Anon and the

<A NAME="Heading620"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Jaggedpine Crook Staff</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest starts in SureFall
Glades. This quest will not work with too high of a character. Talk with Corum
Finisc, just outside the Jaggedpine of SureFall Glades. After some keywords, he
will mention [crook]. This is a Jaggedpine crook staff that is broken in pieces
in Qeynos Hills. Only Gnoll Hunters have the parts. The gnoll hunters are very
rare and getting the staff pieces is difficult. However, once you have both, go
back to Corum Finisc and he will assemble them for you.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>One of the men in the JaggedPine
Treefolk shop wants you to take a claim check to Nesiff's Wooden Weapons in
Qeynos and pick up an icon for him. Do this chore and he will give you some
money and experience. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020616"></A><BR></DIV>

The Nitrates</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Gerael Woodone has a flask he wants
delivered to Linaya Sowlin in West Karana. Doing so results in some faction and
a few coppers. At this point she also asks for your protection from the [unkempt
druids] and tells you of a [note]. However, an NPC by the name of Draze Slashyn
shows up and immediately threatens Linaya after you deliver the Flask. If you
beat him you get Status, Money, a Rusty Axe and the Note Linaya just mentioned.
Linaya will ask you to take the note back to Gerael in surefall (see the
Assassins Quest). </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020617"></A><BR></DIV>

Poacher's Head</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to the first ranger you see
when you go into the ranger guild house. It turns out that there is some poacher
hunting the animals of SureFall Glade and he wants you to end this dastardly
deed and poach the poacher instead. Bring his head back as proof that the
animals are now safe and you will get experience, faction and miney or an item.
Note for the Erudites out there that any poacher head seems to work here.

<A NAME="Heading625"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Talym Shoontar's Head</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You must remove the head of the
master poacher Talym Shoontar from his shoulders and return it to your guild.
This quest can be started either when the guy you turn in the regular poachers
head to mentions him (after turning in a poachers head), or directly started by
talking to Hagar Sureshot in Surefall Glade. Talym appears in Qeynos Hills,
somewhere between the cottage, the road marker, and the Guard Tower. He appears
by the WK zone border and heads down the road towards Qeynos. He is about lvl
15, and is roughly on par with Dorn B'Dynn, the scourge of the Northern Desert
of Ro. Plus, if you attack him in Qeynos Hills, the guards will attack you. For
a safer way to kill him, Shoontar also occasionally appears in Fish Tavern's
back room, where you turn in the moonstones for gnoll stouts. This may only
happen after the executioner appears following the gnasher's head quest. Another
person spotted Shoontar in Freeport at the docks, so he obviously gets around.
You get money, experience and an item. </FONT><BR></DIV>
