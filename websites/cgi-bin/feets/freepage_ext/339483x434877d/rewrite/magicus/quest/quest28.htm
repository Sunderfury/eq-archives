The Mystic Cloak</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In one of the jail cells near Rathyl
there is a high elf enchanter named Linara Parlone. If you hail her she will
tell you how she was locked up and that a mob called Priest of Najena has the
key but left to an estate, Unrest. The Priest of Najena is on the 3rd Floor of
Unrest, looks like a Ghoul and is at least lvl 29. If you kill it you will get a
No Drop key. Give this key to Linara in Najena and she will give you a note to
give to her father in Felwithe. He is near the lake. If you give him the note he
will then give you a Worn Cloak, ac5, and tell you to give it to his wife in
Erudin Palace to have the cloak's "powers" restored. His wife is in the
Enchanter Guild section of Erudin. If you give her the cloak she will restore
its power turning it into a <I>Mystic Cloak</I>.

The Visiting Princess</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There is a quest here, but it may be
broken. The Visiting Priestess spawns near the Ogre Captain. (She used to hand
out a quest for the Blued Two Handed Hammer). Hailing her will lead to her
asking the (evil) PC to get a certain staff for her. The name is similar to the
Good aligned sphinx in Mount Rathe, but it has nothing to do with that. A
non-obvious question (sorry, I can't find the thread with the quotes) will
reveal that the staff has been broken into four parts. These pieces are the four
Crystal Staves: the Ice Crystal Staff, the Water Crystal Staff, the Slime
Crystal Staff, and the Fire Crystal Staff. Collecting these and passing them to
her will return to you... an unreadable note. As you pass her each piece, she
grins evilly and adds it to the staff she is carrying. The note is in Gnollish
but may be unreadable (no one with the note has mentioned achieving mastery of
the Gnollish language, but I can't say it can not be fully read), but you are
told that it says something about "blue flames". This tends to lead one back to
the Blued Two Handed Hammer she handed out in Beta. One other clue: someone
supposedly got her to respond to him saying, "I am the Priestess of Innoruuk."
[There is supposed to be a quest out of Neriak with this key phrase involving a
Scroll of G'Han. There is a slim possiblity that the Visiting Priestess hands
over the Scroll of G'Han, but I can not confirm either way. As far as I know, no
one has tried to hand in the scroll to Loveal or Noxhill]. I am not sure where
you go from here. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020375"></A><BR></DIV>
