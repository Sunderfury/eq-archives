Bandages for Honeybugger</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The Honeybugger brother's hand is
hurt because he was swarmed by bixies while seeking honeycombs for his employer.
Give him a bandage, and he'll thank you with some XP and the following faction:
Merchants of Rivervale, Deep pockets, Guardians of the Vale and Mayor Gubbin get
better and Coalition of Tradesfolk III get worse.

Bug Collection</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(All Classes) Blixkin Entopop roams
the inside of the wall and has an unusual hobby. He collects bug parts, and you
are just the halfling to help him out. Talk to him and ask him about the bug
collection, and he will give you a list of six bug parts and a box to collect
them in. The six bug parts for this quest are: Spiderling eyes, spiderling silk,
Fire beetle eyes, Giant scarab egg sac (note: although there are a few giant
scarabs in Misty Thicket, they're rare. I suggest getting them somewhere else),
Giant fire beetle leg (these are found in the Western Karanas, on the queen
klacknak and on the queen Kliknik in Qeynos who is a faaster spawn), and Giant
wasp wings (these are found in Misty Thicket and camped heavily; the only other
place to get them is on Crookstinger in Lesser Faydark). After collecting the
items, hit combine and give the box back to him, along with the list he gave
you, for your reward. Among the rewards he gives are a <I>Silver Bracelet</I>, a
<I>Bracelet of Beetlekind</I>, a <I>Vial of Spider Venom</I> and a <I>Potion of
Poison Warding</I>, so it is generally a worthwhile quest. you will also get the
following faction changes: Merchants of Rivervale, Deeppockets, Guardians of the
Vale, and Mayor Gubbin all get better, and Coalition of Tradefolk III gets
worse. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020367"></A><BR></DIV>

Eye of Stormhammer</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest for the <I>Avenger
Battle Axe</I>. After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner clockwork quest)
to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him "what important stormguard matter". He will
give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank of High Pass keep. Of
course the prisoner has escaped but she does give you part of the eye of
stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has the other part, the "Emerald
Shard". Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in Rivervale and sometimes near the
southern tower in Misty Thicket. When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he
says he will give it to you if you do a small favor. Apparently a bounty hunter
by the name of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body,
he will give you the emerald. Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket. He
appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)! He hops around between the Orc
camp and the wall. You may have to talk to Bronin to get him to spawn. If you
defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore item), a few gold, and the following
faction adjustments: Frogloks of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of
Kurnak and Iskar get better. When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells
you that he put the emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives
you a key to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold. The key is labeled
H.K.106. Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and
the following faction adjustments: Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands,
Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of River
Vale gets worse. When you turn in the key in highpass bank, you get the emerald
shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the following adjustments:
Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson McCabe all get better. Bronin
also says "There is a [second Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will
need it..." Upon further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the
Gem of Tunare, and is being held by a guild in Kelethin. In Kelethin, go to the
Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about the
Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The only one
who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting "at the lake
near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to Dagnor's Cauldron
and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his brother is a thief (and
only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone to Qeynos, probably to work
for the thieves guild there. Faldor Hendrys is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he
can be found walking out the front gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills
zone sometimes. He may also sometimes be found in Crows Tavern. You need to kill
him to get the gem. Combine the parts and you get the eye of stormguard, which
gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection. If you give it to Beno, he gives
you a long speach about how wonderful a warrior you are and says he is giving
you a "warrior's true weapon designed by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl
Mizebrite." He then will give you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice
warrior only 2HS weapon. It is likely that you need to have a very high faction
with him to get the axe.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020368"></A><BR></DIV>

Honeybugger Assasin</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Paziu Puno (rogue guild neriak)
wants Lil Honeybugger dead and promises a "king's reward" for her head. She
lives in Misty Thicket in the Halfling territory just outside of town.
Unfortunately, she rooms with her big brother Joogl Honeybugger who never seems
to leave her side, and he is probably around level 10 or so. Since you need to
be below this level to get the quest, you had better get some help in killing
her. When you kill Lil, she drops a halfling head (which is what you're supposed
to bring back to Paziu Puno for your "kings reward"), a bandage (so you can
reverse the faction hit you take from killing Lil by giving it to Joogl later),
and a Case of Jum Jum Juice (lore item)(which I guess you can give to the
treant). Here's where this quest gets funny. After sneaking/hiding through
Rivervale and making the run back to Neriak, you need to give the halfling head
to Paziu Puno. He then tells you something to the effect of "Foolish young elf.
This was no contract from King Naythox. I wanted Lil Honeybugger killed before
she gave birth to my child. Only a naive dark elf would set foot in Halfling
territory. Here's your great reward, garbage from other guild exploits." You get
some exp, a few cp, a minor item, and the usual rogue dark elf faction hits
(better with Ebon Mask, worse with guards of qeynos, guardians of the vale, and
wolves of the north). Never trust a dark elf.

Honey Jum</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Lil Honeybugger and her brother can
be found in a lone house in the Misty Thicket. Talk to Lil, and ask her about
the [Honey Jum Recipe]. She'll direct you to an NPC in Rivervale who owns the
Herb Jar. (Just to the right of the Fool's Gold.) This NPC will tell you that
she does, indeed, make Honey Jum, but not for free! You must bring her 3
honeycombs and 3 Platinum. Honeycombs are frequently found on Bixies and Bixie
Drones. You receive the following faction changes: Merchants of Rivervale,
Guardians of the Vale, Deep Pockets and Mayor Gubbin get better, Coalition of
Tradesfolk III gets worse. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020370"></A><BR></DIV>

Orc Belts</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(All Classes) Deputy Budo, who hangs
out in the guard tower in Misty Thicket just south of the opening in the wall
wants you to bring him orc belts. Give them to him one at a time for experience,
faction and money. The faction hits are: +GuardiansoftheVale, +MayorGubbin,
+StormReapers, +MerchantsofRiverVale, -DreadguardOuter

Terrorantula</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>I'm not sure if this leads anywhere,
but Blixkin Entopop mentions a super bug by the name of Terrorantula and asks if
you have heard of it. This partucular spider can be found in South Ro, is a
pretty high level, and is known to drop various body parts, particularly legs,
when killed. Since Blixkin collects bug parts, it may be that he will reward you
if you give him these. However, I have been told of one person who tried to give
it to him and got nothing in return. There is probably more to
this.</FONT><BR></DIV>
