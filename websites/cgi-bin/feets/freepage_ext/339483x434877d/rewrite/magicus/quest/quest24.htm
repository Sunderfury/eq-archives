Fire Goblin Runner</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Narex T'vem in the Warrior's
Guild in Neriak. He will ask you to go to the Lavastorm Mountains and look for a
Fire Goblin Runner who is supplying an Erudite. The runner often zips right
through the area by the zone entrance, and is a fairly low level. If you kill
the Fire Goblin Runner and return his Runner Pouch you will receive some
experience, money and sometimes a Featherweight Pouch. He doesn't give the quest
to higher levels, but still gives the reward for the pouch.

Sir Lindeal's Testimony</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Loveal S&#180;Nez in the
Lodge of the dead in Neriak 3rd Gate to initiate this quest. The forces of evil
have been plagued by the good paladin Sir Lindeal long enough. He is located in
the Lavastorm Mountains and is clearly not well liked by his evil bretheren.
They want you to kill him and return his testimony book. Returning it gets you a
nice item. I have been told of people getting a damask robe and a Cloak of the
Undead Eye from this. </FONT><BR></DIV>
