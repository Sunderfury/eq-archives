Squire Narl</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Every once in while a loug mouthed
squire named Narl appears near the third inn. He is not a very high level, but
can do some serious damage. Kill him and take his head to Altunic, in the hut
nearby (Altunic sometimes wanders the zone too). This will increase your faction
with the Knights of Truth and also get you a little money and exp. After that,
he will ask you to get a cloth shirt (or some other similar item) for him. Buy
the item and give it to him for more exp and a token of generosity. This is used
for the test of truth quest in Freeport. I have been told that you may be able
to get the token without killing squire Narl, and just by giving Altunik the
shirt.</FONT><BR></DIV>
