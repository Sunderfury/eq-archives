Clurg's Revenge</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Clurg the bartender doesn't like
that someone in Neriak is imitating his drinks, and wants you to deal with HER.
Her Name is Pulga and you can finder her standing at the bar in the PVP area in
the forien quarter of Neriak. She hits a LOT harder then her level indicates. At
18 she is blue, however, she is very fast and hits hard. If you ask her about
the "Flaming Pulga" She acts scared. Bring back her head and you will recieve an
item (perhaps the Large Targ Shield), some Gold, and some Exp. WARNING: This
quest SERIOUSLY lowers your faction with the Darkbarganers in neriak. Also,
Clurg won't give you the quest untill you have raised your faction with the
warrior and shadow knight guilds, and with Chef Duga. (See Lizard meat, and
Lizard Tail Quests). </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020417"></A><BR></DIV>

The Emissary</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You need to talk to Marda and follow
the commands to get Emissary Glib to spawn at the ogre guard tower. He will tell
you that he needs a froglock eye necklace. You can get these by killing Troll
Slayers or the Troll Slayer Captain. Return the necklace to the Emissary, and he
will give you a random item. Sometimes you get a very nice reward. I have been
told of people getting a Foragers Bag, a 10 slot 100% weight reducing item and a
Hopper Spear ( 5 damage, 31 delay, +4str).

Exotic Drinks</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is probably the best
quest in the game for a lower level magic user, especially an enchanter. In
fact, with the new changes, only an enchanter (or perhaps a very careful dark
elf) can really do the whole thing. It results in the Stein of Moggok, a great
magic item which gives +10 int, +5 dex, +10 hp, +25 disease resistance, has two
charges of healing and acts as a greater light source. The items can be
collected by just about anyone, but you need to to be an enchanter to finish the
quest. I know the quest works every time with a level 20 enchanter who has
illusion ogre and benevolence. It also can work in some instances with a level
12 enchanter who has illusion dark elf and alliance. It is a lengthy quest,
requiring you to go all over the world to get items, but worth it. Clurg, the
Ogre bartender in Ogguk, has lost his bartender's compendium and wants it back
badly. It is currently held by Bartender Gregor, in Freeport. Fortunately,
Gregor has a lust for exotic drinks, and lacks only the ingredients to make his
dream concoctions. He will give you the compendium for those ingredients. He
wants you to get him the following items: (1) a Kiola Nut, which can be
purchased on the island of Erollisi for about 2 gp, (2) Erud's Tonic [now a no
drop lore item] (see Erudin quests, basically a quick purchase and exchange),
(3) Honey Jum from Rivervale (See Rivervale Quests - the price is now 3
platinum) [note: You need an indifferent faction in Rivervale for this one or
you need to trust a halfling to get it for you. If you can't find a trustworthy
halfling, (I had the misfortune of initially getting ripped off by a
particularly nasty halfling named Mappas who believed he could extort 5 pp for
the honey jum after I gave him the items and a promise of 5 gp to get it [back
when it only cost 5 gp for the item]) you can easily create one of your own and
do the exchange since a level 1 can easily do this part of the quest], and (4) a
Koalindl Fish from the lake in the Temple of Life in Qeynos [now a no drop lore
item]. This is the hardest and most costly part of the quest. You will take a
severe faction hit with several good factions and with Rodcet Nife himself for
killing the fish, dropping several levels in faction, and you will get attacked
and killed when you leave the water unless you gate in time. (There is also a
paladin who will jump in and kill you in the water if he is nearby). The fish do
not drop a corpse every time, so you may have to kill several fish, potentially
making you kos with many clerics afterwards. Also, they are a slow spawn and are
currently being camped quite a bit. I don't know if this will work, but it might
be possible for two people to do this with one creating a mule to kill the fish
and take the faction hit, while the enchanter who will complete the quests loots
it and gets the item. As another alternative, Frostbite the Dog in WK sometimes
drops a Koalindl fish if his master is not around, but you lose some serious
faction for this as well and one of the people you lose faction with happens to
spend a lot of time in Gregor's bar, making it tough to complete the quest if
you become kos with her. Although the resulting drink sounds pretty foul to me,
should you manage to gather all of these ingredients he promises to give you his
bartender's compendium. The enchanter must give Gregor the ingredients. I have
been told that some people have had the quest fail by giving him all of the
items at once (it will say he only got one) and others have had no trouble. I
would suggest to be safe that you give them to him one at a time. Gregor will
then give him 3 to 4 pp and the bartender's compendium, which is a no drop item.
This has to be taken to Ogguk and given to Clurg the bartender there. Be aware
that even under an illusion some ogres might attack you, so it might help to go
invisible. Before giving it to Clurg, the enchanter needs to cast illusion ogre
and benevolence. Or as an alternative, cast illusion dark elf and alliance (this
lets it be done by a lower level enchanter, but does not seem to work every
time). If his or her faction is not good enough, it won't work (I have had
reports that indifferent has worked for some people and not worked for others,
but that is probably the minimum he should con). Clurg will then give you the
stein. I would say, assuming you can get sow when needed, you can do this quest
in just about 3 hours (less if you have teleports).

HEHE meat</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest to get the
<I>Grobb Cleaver</I>. It starts in Grobb (of course). Talk to Carver, by the
Shaman's guild, and he will tell you he wants 3 pieces of a meat called "HEHE
meat" and the recipe to make it. You can purchase the meat in Oggok from Dooga
the Ogre Chef. (He has a seperate quest to deliver froglock legs). He will send
you to deliver a Grub Locker of Dwarf Pickles to his Troll friend in the Ocean
of Tears, Nerbilik. Nerbilik is fishing on the Siren rocks. Be careful, since I
have been told the guards may kill you even though they con indifferent. Give
him the locker and you will receive approximately 1 plat, increased faction with
DaBashers and decreased faction with BrokenSkull Clan, and some xp. However, he
will refuse to give you the recipe he has, so you need to kill him and loot it
from his corpse. Then take the recipe and 3 HEHE meats back to Carver and he
will give you a Grobb Cleaver for you efforts.

Marda's Secret Mission</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Marda will tell you to run to the
Bouncer Keep near the entrance to Oggok and speak with a froglock named Glib and
tell him that the Greenblood Shaman sent you. After speaking to Marda, you must
run immediately to Prakk's tower to speak with Glib, the secret froglok emmisary
to Oggok. Glib will be waiting for you on the top floor of the tower. If you
stop to buy things or talk with an NPC, Glib will disappear. Glib will ask you
to kill the Troll Slayer in Innothule Swamp and return with the Slayer's silver
neclace. After slaying the Troll Slayer, Glib wants you to slay a Slayer
Captain. After slaying the Captain, Glib mentions the froglock prisoner in
Grobb. The froglock is named "a prisoner" and is located near the gem vendor in
Grobb. Tell the prisoner, "Glib sent me", and he will tell you he doesn't
believe you and to prove you are legit, he wants the necklace of a Troll basher
(intestine necklace +5 hp). Upon returning the necklace, he will give you an
empty jar to be taken to Froger Grikk in the swamp. You may also sometimes get a
nice item (I have been told a hopper spear). Take the jar to Grikk and he will
give a item to be taken back to the prisoner (I forget the item). The prisoner
will then give you a note to be take back to Marda. This note explains how
Zimbittle (female NPC in swamp) is teaching the Lizardman Mystic to fight Ogres.
Marda then insist you kill Zimbittle and return with her pouch as proof. After
returning the pouch you are rewarded 2 first level shaman spells. Big whoop.

Noble Hunters</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Contact Kogna and Guntrik in the
warriors guild of Oggok. You can talk to Kogna first and tell him you are a
mighty warrior of the guild he will mention something about the Noble Hunters of
Humans and Elves, but you can skip this part and go directly to Guntrik who is
also in the warrior guild hall. He will give you the rest of the quest info.
Kill Noble Hunters of Humans and Elves, return to him any house crests or an
item that says where the Hunters sleep and he will reward you. The rewards range
from Raw Hide Armor, Rusty 2 handed weapons, and rarely a <I>Crude Stein</I>.
You also get some exp and some money. The nobles are easy to find, they tend to
hang out right in front of Gukk, and terrorize the newbies in inithule. They are
around levels 14 - 17. NOTE: You get negative faction hits with humans for
killing the nobles. Also, you need a realativly high faction with the warrior
guild to be able to turn in the Crests. You can raise your faction with the
Lizard meat, and lizard tail quests. If you find any high elf meat or human
meat, give it to Chef Dooga </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020429"></A><BR></DIV>

Nork's Severed Arm</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Lork wants you to find his brother
Nork's dismembered body from a fat alligator in Innothule Swamp. Kill the
alligator and recover Nork's severed arm. Take it back to Lork and he will give
you a Broken Stein to take to the ogre trainer Uglan in Neriak. CAUTION - Uglan
will kill shamen or shadowknights on sight. Uglan will then ask you to intercept
a Blue Orc Runner and get a letter off of him and return it to Lork. The letter
details a conspiracy between the Crushbone Orcs and the dark elves against the
ogres. For a reward, Lork will give you an item, sometimes a <I>Crude Stein</I>.
Then, as pay back, Lork wants you to bring him the hearts of Lord Crushbone and
the dark elf ambassador who visits the shaman guild in Oggok. The dark elf
ambassador is named K'ryn and he is located in komarr's caves (the tunnels). If
you enter the tunnels through the bottom right tunnel, contune through the
tunnels until you reach the shaman trainers you should go to the right and there
will be six or so ogres who sell the shaman spells. In that room there is
another tunnel which will bring you to a room with about five different
passages. In one of those passages waits the dark elf ambassador. You need to
kill him and get his heart. (he also often drops a dragoon dagger). For killing
K'ryn, you lose faction with IndigoBrotherhood, but gain with EmeraldWarriors
and SteelWarriors. The Lord Crushbone is the always camped D'Vinn. You need to
kill him as well and get his heart. Once you have both hearts, return them to
Lork and receive your reward. The reward varies a lot and is often bad (like
patchwork armor), but you might sometimes get something good, like a <I>Crude
Stein</I> or very rarely, a <I>Gatormash Maul</I>. I have been told that you
don't have to do the first part to do the Gatorsmash portion, and can skip
directly to getting the two hearts and returning them to Lork. I have also been
told that you can make sure that you get the Maul over the stein by already
having a stein equipped.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020430"></A><BR></DIV>

Preserved Meat Delivery</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In the Oggok tavern there is an ogre
chef named Dooga. If you talk to her enough she will give you preserved meat to
deliver to an ogre named The Gobbler in Neriak. Take him his meat and he'll
occasionally give you a nice item (I have been told of an <I>Ogre Meat
Cleaver</I> and <I>Ogre Butcher Gloves</I>). Your faction will increase with
Neriak Ogre. This quest can be done at a pretty low level (perhaps as low as 4),
making it a nice way to get a magic item for a newbie character.
