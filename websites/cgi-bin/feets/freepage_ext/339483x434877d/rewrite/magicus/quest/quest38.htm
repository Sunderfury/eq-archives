Dragon Armor</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Karam Dragonforge will make a
special Dragon Armor for you. You need a high faction with him to get the quest,
but I have been told that wolf form will work.

Red Dragonscale Armor: </H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>To acquire the Armor, one needs to
have one red dragonscale (from Nagafen), one vial of swirling smoke, and 1000pp.
He is located at the Human Inn in Rathe Mountains. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading555"></A><H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
White Dragonscale Cloak: </H3>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>To acquire the armor, you need a
wedding ring and a wedding present for his wife. For a ring, he wants a platinum
and diamond ring. For a present he wants, a black sapphire and platinum
necklace. He also needs the white dragon scale.

The Etched Stone</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>I am told this quest is for the
level 49 shadowknight Lifedraw spell. There is a necro npc named Kazann
something. He cons blue to a level 50, so is very high level. He will not even
talk to you if you are not level 50. He tells evil aligned characters to give
him 2000pp! and he will give a stone called a hyacinth to be etched by a gnome
shop keeper in Rathe Mtns. He tells you that the gnome does not like the
necromantic arts, so you will have to conceal your identity when dealing with
him. The necro npc tells you to bring back the hyacinth, a gold necklace like
the purest snow (the White Gold Necklace found on the Froglock Noble in Lower
Guk), an orb of the purest crystal (the Crystalline Orb from the Stone Spider in
Nagafen's Lair), and the blood of xenyari the druid. He tells you that the blood
must be voluntarily given by xenyari, so killing her will not do. To get the
blood you must bring Xenyari Lisariel a Prickly Pear. The prickly pear drops off
of an ice terror, one of Lady Vox's guardians. Be careful and place it deep in
your inventory or you might eat it before you return it. When you bring her the
pear, she says "Prickly Pears! I just love Prickly Pears!! Thank you so much for
getting these for me. I really, really appreciate your gift and I shall not
OWW!! I hate when I stick myself with the needles. Oh look, I am bleeding now.
Sigh. Can you hold this note for a moment please? My hands are full and I must
clean up." You will get a "Bloodied Piece of Parchment. Now take the parchment,
necklace and orb back to the gnome, and he will ask for another 1000 pp before
giving up the etched rune, which is called a Faceted Hyacinth. Take the Faceted
Hyacinth back to the Necromancer and he will give you an amulet and no
instructions on what you need to do with it. (the amulet can be kept if you want
as it gives +7 int and +7 agil when worn). However, if you take that back to
Xenyari she will be struck dead and the amulet will be changed. You need to take
that back to the Necromancer once again. Make sure you have a group of friends
along because when you give him the amulet a level 53 zombie called a monstrous
zombie will spawn, and you have to kill it and give its heart to the Necromancer
to receive your spell. Good luck. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020558"></A><BR></DIV>

Journeyman Boots</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Hasten Bootstrutter in the Rathe
Mountains wants several items in exchange for his extra pair of Journeyman
Boots. First, he asks for a shadowed rapier, from a Shadowed Man, which will
poof when you camp, so get this last. Second, he asks for a Ring of the
Ancients, which is found on the Ancient Cyclops in South Ro. Finally, he asks
you for 3,250 Gold Coins. He also talks like Yoda, and runs really fast, and
doesn't spawn that often. He claims that the boots will disintegrate if you kill
him, so I assume that he doesn't just drop them when he dies (and he is really
tough to kill). </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020559"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading558"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Monks of the Whistling Fist</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>It is likely that you need to be a
tailor to do this. Brother Qwinn in Southern Karana seeks the return of the code
of the whistling fist, which was stolen by him. It is dropped by Targin the
Rock, a rare spawn in the Sol B throne room. Bring him the Code and a purple
silent fist headband and you will get a special needle. Brother Zephyl in Rathe
Mountains wants the Idol of Zan Fi, which is in the possession of Brother
Raster, who spawns in the Mino Elders room in Lower Guk. Returning this Idol,
plus a red sash, results in a special tailoring pattern. These two items need to
be combined in a sewing kit with a swatch of shadow silk (tailored) and a Scroll
of Jonathans Whistling Warsong, which is bought from the Bards Guild, to make a
monk only item called the Robe of the Lost Circle.

Paladin Armor of Ro</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Supposedly the drop rates of the
items has been increased lately to make this quest easier to do. I am still not
sure how you can raise the Deepwater Knights faction if you start out to low to
get the low level Erudin quests. This is an extremely involved quest. For each
piece of armor, you need to do three things. </FONT><BR></DIV>
<OL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>	You need to get the mold for the item. You do
this by fetching the quest items and turning them in to the NPC who gives the
item quest. You need to develop a high <I>faction</I> with the NPC's Guild
before he or she will give you the quest. [NOTE - It may be that faction is no
longer important since a recent patch.] You can get the quests immediately from
those who view you warmly [or perhaps amiably]. If your faction is not high
enough, they will request that you go to their guild and talk to someone there
first before getting the quest. Those below amiable will not talk to you. Below
are the people who start the quests and the methods of getting the molds for
each item. All molds are no drop lore items, so whoever turns in the items must
finish the quest. </FONT></OL><UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><I>Boots of
Ro:</I> Given by Paladin Nicolas [Dwarf Paladin]. Faction needed with the Dwarf
Paladin's Guild [Clerics of Underfoot]. Bring him the plans for the Brazen Brass
Kilij from a Sand Giant in South Ro and he will reward you with the mold for the
boots.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><I>Bracer
of Ro:</I> Given by Paladin David [Erudite Paladin]. Faction needed with the
Erudite Paladin's Guild [Deepwater Knights]. Bring him two Goblin Nets from the
elusive goblin net masters/deepwater goblin netmasters (the waters of Lake
Rathe) and he will reward you with the Bracer Mold.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><I>Breastplate
of Ro:</I> Given by Paladin Abigail. Faction needed with the Clerics of Tunare
in Felwithe. If you are not given the quest outright, go ask the leader of the
church in Felwithe if you are a [honored member] and if he says yes you can do
this quest. Bring her 2 Dark Cauldrons (from the cooks in Mistmoore. approx
level 31 shadowknights) and she will give you the mold for the breastplate.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><I>Gauntlets
of Ro:</I> Given by Sentry Joanna. Faction needed with the Temple of Marr in
Freeport [Priests of Marr]. If you are not given the quest outright, go ask
Gygus Remnara at the Temple if you are an [honored member] and if he answers yes
you have good enough faction for the quest. Bring her the locket from Sentry
Alechin of Qeynos [approx level 31. you can kill him or as a guard or werewolf
(SK) and get it] and she will reward you with the mold for the Gauntlets.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><I>Greaves
of Ro:</I> Given by Paladin Elisabeth [Half Elf Paladin]. Faction needed with
the Hall of Truth in Freeport [Knights of Truth]. If you are not given the quest
outright, go ask Theron Rolius at the Hall am [I an honored member], and if he
says yes you have good enough faction for this quest. Bring her a head from a
Nightfall Giant (approx level 35. West Commonlands) and she will reward you with
the mold for the greaves.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2 COLOR="Maroon">	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="Maroon"><I>Helm
of Ro:</I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2> Given by Paladin Thomas. Faction
needed with Temple of Thunder in Qeynos [Knights of Thunder]. If you are not
given the quest outright, go ask someone (not sure who) in the Temple if you
have proved your nobility and if he answers yes, you have good enough faction to
do the quest. Bring him 2 skulls from the undead cyclopses (approx level 35.
plains of thunder/Karana - kill regular cyclops to get them to appear) and he
will reward you with the mold for the helm.
</FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2>	</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><I>Vambraces
of Ro:</I> Given by Paladin Marianna. Faction needed wtih the Temple of Life in
Qeynos [Priests of Life]. If you are not given the quest outright, go ask High
Priestess Jhanda am [I an honored member] and if she says yes you have good
enough faction to do this quest. Bring her 2 rotten shark portions from plague
sharks (a rare spawn found in Erud's Crossing. approx level 30, but around
killer sharks which are level 40 or so) and she will reward you with the mold
for the vambraces. </FONT></UL><OL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>	Once you get the mold for an item, you need to
talk to Lord Searfire, the Dwarven Smith in The Temple of Solusek Ro. He must
consider you warmly before he will deal with you. He will then give you the Sol
Cauldron and tell you how to do the next step, which is acquiring the
ingredients to make the metal ronium. These are: Melatite (Dropped by MB and MC
Clockworks in Solusek's Eye. You can also sometimes buy them from the Gnomes in
Solusek's Eye since many players sell them if they find them), Two Bars of
Enchanted Platinum, Mistmoore Granite (from Gargoyles in Mistmoore), the Sands
of Ro (from sand giants) and Soil of Underfoot (Get from Priestess Ghalea in the
Kaladim cleric's guild for 4 fairy dusts [need very high faction for this]). Put
them in the cauldron and hit the combine button and you will get a bar of
ronium. I have been told you no longer need a blacksmithing skill to combine
these, but cannot confirm this. </FONT><LI><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>	Once you
get the ronium, you need to combine it with the mold in a forge to make your
item. Any forge will do. You need to have a decent blacksmithing skill for this.
(this might have changed in a recent patch so that blacksmithing is no longer
necessary). It seems like a skill over 100 will almost always work and skills as
low as 50 will usually work, but after doing all that work you want your skill
to be as high as possible.
