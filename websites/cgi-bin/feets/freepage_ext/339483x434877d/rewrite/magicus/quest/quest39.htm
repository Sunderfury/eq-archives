The Bind</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Llscent Tagglefoot by the druids
guild is in a bind. He will say he needs somone to deliver a case of jumjum
juice to Xanuusus a treant in the Northern Karanas Plains. Say "I will take the
Jumjum Juice" and you will be provided with a case. Getting to Treant is a long
walk. Go to North Karana and follow the water to the right. When you hit the
mountains follow them and you will run right into him. I have been told you no
longer have to levitate to give him the jum jum juice. Also, apparantly Xanuusus
is not smart enough or just doesn't care to distinguish between the jum jum you
get from Llscent and that you find from looting bixies. Who's going to argue
with a Treant? So any case of jum jum juice will work. Factions go up with
StormReapers, MayorGubbin, and MerchantsofRiverVale, and went down with the
UnkemptDruids. You will also get some minor coin and a minor item. Considering
that bixies are very low level creatures and drop jum jum quite frequently, this
may be a good way for low level characters to make some money (Assuming you
survive the trek through N Karana).

Blackburrow Stout</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Hail Rueppy Kutpurse and she asks if
you want something to drink. Ask her what she wants to drink and she says how
about beer. After you give her a beer, she says it's good, but not as good as
blackburrow stout. (But what is?) Ask here about blackburrow stout and she
responds that you can smuggle it. If you then ask her about smuggling and she
will ask you if you want a job. Should you choose to accept, you have to go to
the ruins on the other side of the great wall, find Gungrich, and tell him that
Dark Rivers Flow East. The ruins are the undead hill on the other side of the
wall in Misty Thicket. When you say this to Gunrich, he gives you a case of
blackburrow stout. Take the case back to Rueppy Kutpurse and she gives you some
small change and experience. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020566"></A><BR></DIV>

The Bloody Shank</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Be warned that this quest can really
mess with your faction with the deep pockets. Visit the Captain standing out on
a balcony in Highhold Keep. Hail him and answer his questions. It seems a petty
rogue escaped the dungeon in Highhold Keep but left behind crucial evidence. The
rogue's <I>Bloody Shank</I> was sticking out of a guards back! The Captain gives
you the shank to take to the rogue to let the rogue know why you are there to
kill him. The rogue's name is Bronin Higginsbot and he hangs around the
Deeppockets in Rivervale. He may sometimes be found around the southernmost
tower in Rivervale. Hand him the bloody shank and then kill him, but be careful
because a bodyguard sometimes spawns next to him when you hand him the shank and
also the guards will help him if they are nearby. Killing him lowers faction
with Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Trade Folk and Carson
McCabe and raises it with Merchants of Rivervale. Return his head for decent
money and experience. You will raise faction with Highpass Guards, Carson
McCabe, Merchants of Highpass, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia. There
is also a rogue named Shayde Higginsbot on the second floor of the Fool's Gold.
When you hand him the bloody shank he does not give the generic (Thank you.)
response. Not sure what happens if you slay him too.

Chomper</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>A female NPC on the second floor in
the rogues guild (Fool's Gold building) wants you to prove yourself as the new
dishwasher by finding a missing jewel that is inside of a fish named Chomper.
Chomper is a level 3 small aggressive fish that can be found in the water by the
Rivervale docks. He always spawns with a Large Ruby that you return for some
faction, experience, and some silver. You will get the following faction
changes: Deepockets, CircleOfUnseenHands, CoalitionOfTradeFolkIII, and
CarsonMcCabe go up; MerchantsOfRivervale goes Down.

Deputy Tagil's Debt</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Speak with Uner Gnarltrunk at
Tagglefoot's Farmstead. He will tell you that clumsy old Deputy Tagil stepped on
some veggies and has forgotten to pay for them. He will then send you to Tagil
with note to remind him of his debt. He is in Misty Thicket guarding the
entrance to Rivervale. Give him note when you find him and he will give you
payment which you need to take back to Uner for experience, a random rewardand
the follow faction changes: Storm Reapers, Mayor Gubbin and Merchants of
Rivervale get better, Unkempt Druids gets worse.

The Fishslayers</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Talk to Marshall Lanena in the first
hall before the Sheriff and she will send you down to the lake to talk to the
shopkeeper there, who I believe is named Fiddy Bobek, about his problem. He
tells you that there are piranha eating all of the fish in the lake. He wants
you to kill the piranha and bring him their teeth as proof. He also mentions
bringing one back to the Marshall to prove he's not crazy. Well he isn't crazy,
and there are indeed piranha in there. Jump in and start killing piranha (be
careful they tend to come in pairs - and keep an eye on your air meter). Each
tooth gets you between one and two gold pieces -- real good money for a level 7
or 8 player. They also have fish and scales as loot, so you can conceivably get
more than 2 gold per fish. Plus if you give him 4 at a time, you sometimes get
an item. You get the following faction changes for each tooth: MayorGubbin,
merchantsofrivervale, deeppockets, guardiansofthevale all go up,
coalitionoftradesfolkIII goes down. If you bring a tooth back to the Marshall as
proof, she will give you a bag to fill with four teeth. Fill the bag and combine
it and give it back to her and you get a <I>Rantho Rapier</I>, a lousy 2HS sword
damage-wise, but useful for practicing your 2HS skills because of the good
delay. Your faction changes for this ware the same as giving the teeth to Fiddy.

Going Postal</H2>

Honey Jum</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Lil Honeybugger and her brother can
be found in a lone house in the Misty Thicket. Talk to Lil, and ask her about
the [Honey Jum Recipe]. She'll direct you to an NPC in Rivervale named Kizzie
Mintopp, who owns the Herb Jar. (Just to the right of the Fool's Gold.) She will
tell you that she does, indeed, make Honey Jum, but not for free! You must bring
her 3 honeycombs and 30 gold. Honeycombs are frequently found on Bixies and
Bixie Drones. You receive the following faction changes: Merchants of Rivervale,
Guardians of the Vale, Deep Pockets and Mayor Gubbin get better, Coalition of
Tradesfolk III gets worse. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020572"></A><BR></DIV>

by your willingness to do menial errands after delivering Reebo Leafsway's
carrots to her that she will ask you to deliver Jillin's stew to Deputy Lowmot
in the Guardian's stronghold. Upon delivery, he will reward your efforts with
some coppers and experience and the following faction: Guardians of the Vale,
Mayor Gubbin, Storm Reapers and Merchants of Rivervale get better and Deathfist
Orcs gets worse. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020574"></A><BR></DIV>

Kevlin's Bride</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Not sure where this leads if
anywhere, but it's an interesting storyline. Hail Kevlin Diggs and ask him about
Sonsa Fromp. He will tell you that he used to be married to her, but that she
shamed his family by cheating his customers. Hail Sonsa and she will tell you
that in actuality, left her for "that trollop", Lashinda Hoggletop. Talking to
Meeka Diggs, and she will confirm that Lashinda is Kevlin's new bride, and tell
you that she likes her. Ask Kevlin's brother Twippie Diggs about Lashinda though
and he will tell you that he thinks she is cheating on him with a dwarf, of all
things, named Lindo, who supposedly hangs out at that famed theive's hangout The
Fool's Gold. I assume you need to find Lindo or Lashinda to continue this love
story. I don't know if it leads anywhere or is just a fun way to kill time in
Rivervale. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020575"></A><BR></DIV>

Kevlin Diggs Debt</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Ace Slighthand, the casino owner on
the second floor of the rogues guild wants you to collect payment from a welcher
named Kevlin Diggs who is the town armorer. Kevlin is friend's with the Mayor
and has a mean dog named Mangler that guards his stash. In the back bedroom of
Kevlin's shop on his bed is where a coin spawns that you have to get. The hard
part is getting past his dog that will attack you. You can either sneak past the
dog, or just run in and get the coin and run out quickly but making sure you DO
NOT attack the dog. If you do attack the dog Kevlin and all the deputies will
jump in and kill you. Once you retrieve the coin return it to Ace and you will
get some experience, faction, and some copper.

LeatherFoot Raiders</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Marshall Anrey gives you a quest to
bring him four skins to show your worthiness to join the leatherfoot squad: a
Polar Bear Skin (from polar bears in everfrost), a Grizzly Bear Skin (from
grizzlies in the Karanas), a Shark Skin (from sharks, or buy from vendor at the
Rivervale dock), and an Alligator Skin (from bull alligators in Innothule
Swamp). Turn them in to Marshal Anrey and he will reward you with a cap with AC
4 +10 char. When you get the cap, he will ask you to return it along with a
dragoon dagger to receive the real <I>Leatherfoot Raider Skullcap</I>. If you
did this before the patch and have the old cap, I am told you can turn that in
with a dragoon dagger to get the new one.

Nillipus the Brownie</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Reebo Leefsway wants you to teach
Nillipus a lesson for stealing Jumjum. You must hunt the evil brownie down and
slay him. He is approx level 17. He gives good experience and a lot of gold as
well as the stolen Jumjum stalks. Return 4 of these stalks (give them 1 at a
time) to Reebo to complete the quest. You may have to kill him several times and
really teach him a lesson to acquire 4 stalks (the number may vary depending
upon your faction). Your reward is faction, experience, platinum, and a random
magic item. The item you get varies a lot. Some of the items you may get are:
Regular Lightstone; Travelers Pouch (very nice, but small bag); <I>Earring of
Fire Reflection</I> (+5 sv Fire, AC1); <I>Earring of Magic Reflection</I> (+5 sv
Magic, AC1); <I>Earring of Poison Refelection</I> (+5 sv Poison, AC1);
<I>Earring of Disease Reflection</I> (+5 sv Poison, AC1); <I>Runners Ring</I>
(+2 agility, +2 stamina [not SoW]), Wand of Frost Bolts, <I>Rod of
Identification</I> . Because it gives some nice items, many people hunt the
filching brownie, so expect lots of competition. He likes to run around the main
roundabout in town around Fool's Gold and down the passage by Meeka Diggs.

Rebo's Carrots</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Outside Tagglefoot's Farmstead in
the garden is Reebo Leafsway. If you talk to him he will eventually ask you to
deliver a crate of carrots to Blinza Toepapal at the Fool's Gold. Should you
choose to be his errand boy/girl, be warned he's not very trustworthy. The first
crate he gives you has rotten carrots, if you take that to Blinza she will give
it back and your faction will go down. You can still take it back for the good
carrots, but if you immediately return it to Reebo you will get the good crate
which you can then take to Blinza for exp and copper and a lead into another
quest (Jillin's Stew) </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020579"></A><BR></DIV>

Runnyeye Warbeads</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Warning. There may be a problem with
the factions for this quest since the last patch which can harm your Rivervale
faction if you do it. Return these to the sheriff at the top floor of the bank
in rivervale. You should give the sheriff 4 sets at a time. Do NOT give him
shattered warbeads or bead necklaces - you will not get rewarded for those. You
get experience, faction, some money, and an occasional nice item (this quest has
changed recently to give you better items). Your faction will drop for
DeathFistOrcs and raise for Guardians of the Vale, Mayor Gubbin, Storm Reapers,
and Merchants of River Vale. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020580"></A><BR></DIV>

Shakey the Scarecrow's Head</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>At the Tagglefoot farm, hail Shakey
the Scarecrow, and one of the Leafsway NPCs will comment that Shakey isn't
himself lately. There are two quests out of this: the head and the stuffing. The
druid tells you that they have no idea what can be done to fix Shakey's head,
and asks you to [research] the problem. There is an NPC on the top floor of the
Erudin Library who has a document on the creation of Scarecrows, and she's
willing to let you have a peek for the mere pittance of 2 platinum. When you
give her the 2 pp she gives you a copy of a page torn out of a book and tells
you that a female Teir'Dal (dark elf) was the first person to create a scarecrow
head. From the information on the page it sounds like she is trapped in
Mistmoore. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020581"></A><BR></DIV>

Shakey the Scarecrow's Stuffing</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>At the Tagglefoot farm, hail Shakey
the Scarecrow, and one of the Leafsway NPCs will comment that Shakey isn't
himself lately. There are two quests out of this: the head and the stuffing. It
seems Shakey's stuffing is rather old, and his pumpkin head is beginning to
crack. To fix his stuffing, you need magical hay. The Magical Hay that must be
harvested can only be found in the Plains of Karana. If you travel to the corn
fields of West Karana and kill some Scarecrows there, you may sometimes get some
magic hay for loot. I have laso been told that Cleet Miller will drop bails of
hay as he wanders his field. Next, you are required to obtain a Flask of the
Blessed Oil of Life. How to obtain this is detailed in The Blessed Oil Quest in
W Karana. Now comes the very hardest part. You must have the hay cursed by the
High Priest of Cazic-Thule named Roror, who lives in the Feerrott. Hail him and
say 'Bless my hay' or 'Curse my hay' he will tell you he wants 66 gold to bless
the hay. Give him the 66 gold and hay at the same time, he will give you back a
sack of cursed hay. When you do this, your faction with beta neutral goes up,
which is important for wizards who want to do the ice comet quest later on.
After the hay is cursed, you need to combine the cursed hay with the blessed oil
of life in the forge nearby and you will get a sack of writhing hay. Then give
the result to Shakey and you will receive a pretty nice item (<I>Wee
Harvester</I> or <I>Belt of the River</I>).

gold who gives the chomper's gem quest, explains that the gem was lost in an old
pouch. You can find the pouch lying near the lake. Return it to her for some

Wall Squad Ring</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Warning. There may be a problem with
the factions for this quest since the last patch which can harm your Rivervale
faction if you do it. This quest involves gaining at a lot of faction points
(the exact number is unknown and depends on your starting faction) through
whatever method you can use. You gain the points doing most Rivervale quests
including: Giving Runnyeye Warbeads to Sheriff Rogilo (worth 1 point each
necklace), giving Deathfist Slashed Belt to Deputy Budo (worth approximately 5
points each belt), killing goblins (worth 1-3 points), killing Mooto (he is
worth around 20 points), or just killing lots and lots of goblins. Once you
achieve enough faction points you ask Marshal Ghobber who is located on the
bottom floor of the bank, "Am I one with the Wall?" you will receive a <I>Squad
Ring</I> (charged with an 80 hp healing spell). The ring can be recharged by a
female cleric in Rivervale, but you need a different faction to get it
recharged. It is also a no drop lore item. You can, however, complete this quest
multiple times. </FONT><BR></DIV>
