Lord Grimlot's Love</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest no longer results in the
Electrum-Bladed Wakizashi. I am not sure what if anything you get for this. Lord
Grimlot tells you about his poor, misguided beloved Arlena, who has run away
from him to Mistmoore castle. Being the sentimental type, he wants you to track
down the lass, kill her and return her either the lute of the gypsy or her
bones. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020361"></A><BR></DIV>

Solusek's Flower</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In the graveyard there is a tomb. Go
behind the tomb and there is a renegade shadowed man (he now follows Solusek Ro)
who wants you to retrieve a flower from the tomb for him. This is very simple -
go in the tomb, mind the floor traps on the sides and grab the little bag (the
flower) off of the top of of the coffin. This, when given to the renegade
shadowed man, will yield a scepter (necro only, magic, lore, nodrop item, no
stats) and a faction adjustment. +Faction with the temple of solusek ro folks,
and -Faction with the shadowed men. The flower repops every minute or so, so if
you are camping in the graveyard or tower, you can run over and get a faction
boost every once in a while. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020363"></A><BR></DIV>

Vampire Teeth</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the current quest for the
<I>Electrum-Bladed Wakazashi</I>. It is not easy to complete. The Avenging
Catliff is a non-aggressive npc. You don't need any faction. You can kill him
1000 times he will be non agrro. You hail him and he glares his fangs with a
electrum bladed wakizashi. You ask him about the wakizashi and he tells you he
is looking for his mother and father. You ask him "Who is you mother?" and "Who
is your father?" and he tells you Maid Issis and Butler Syncall are captives in
Castle Mistmoore and he wants you to free their souls by killing them. He will
reward you if you bring back their fangs to show him that you freed their souls.
Maid Issis and the Butler Sincall are located fairly deep within Mistmoore. The
teeth are very rare drops (roughly 5% - and these two particular NPC's are
usually camped as well). Anyway, if you're lucky enough to obtain the teeth
(both of them), you simply give them to Avenging Catliff (who spawns behind the
graveyard). He will give you the EBW. And since Avenging Catliff also drops some
nice stuff, he's usually camped 24 / 7 as well (he gets to breathe Norrath air
for about 3 seconds before the spells and swords start raining in).
