Aenia and Behroe</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>In North Queynos there's a blue
house which holds a daughter and her father. Only thing is they never leave.
Why? Well first because the father hasn't gotten his shop up yet and more
importantly because his daughter, Aenia, is not allowed to leave the house. This
is because he doesn't want her around such rapscallions as those lowly bards,
especially one certain one named Behroe Dlexon, who works nights at the docks
compiling the watch report. Well it turns out that Aenia and Behroe are in love
and if you go see him he tells his tale of woe. He is upset because Aenia's
father will kill him if he goes near her. The lovesick fool has written a ballad
that he will ask you to sing to her for him. You need to /say to Aenia the
entire sonnet. Make sure you don't make a typo or it won't work. Aenia will
swoon and gave you a love letter to take back to Behroe (note that Behroe only
spawns at night - you might have to start the "watch reports" quest to spawn
him). Take the love letter back to Behroe and he gives you a nice low-level
item. (Usually a Shaw of the Wind Spirit). For completing the quest you get the
following faction: LeagueofAntonicanBards, KnightsofTruth and GuardsofQeynos get
better; RingofScale and MayongMistmoore get worse.

The Assassin</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This quest is sometimes given to you
after you complete the Nitrates quest in Surefall Glades. Return to surefall and
give the note to Gerael for status and few coins. Gerael returns the note to you
and asks you to give it to Captain Tillim in Qeynos. He asks you to also to warn
the target (Gash Flockwaller) that [They are Trying to kill him]. Go to Qeynos
and give the note to Captain Tillim. You are rewarded with some faction and told
that Gash stays in the Lion's head INN. Going to the Lion's head inn. Gash
Flockwaller should be in a back room during the day. Talking to him and
repeating the key phrase as [they are trying to kill you] gives you a clue about
the unkempt druids - that they carry [black wood chips]. Somewhere in this the
Assassin will attack - his name is Raffel Minnmorn. At this point the quest may
be broken. One time I beat the assassin with Gash's assistance - as a result the
body dissappeared and I couldn't loot it; the second time I got a ranger/druid
mob together and we splatted him, but since I hadn't gotten the wood chip
comment yet all that I got from him was a rusty dagger. Raffel con's black to a
10th level ranger, but he has a slew of druid spells and shouldn't be solo'd
unless you are pretty strong or lucky. So the ending is still unclear.

Bandit Sashes</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Chesgard, in the house of thunder,
is willing to reward those who help eliminate the bandits in the Karanas. Bring
him a bandit sash and he will give you xp, faction, some decent gold and an item
(often bronze). You get the following faction changes: Knights of Thunder,
Priests of Life and Guards of Qeynos go up and Bloodsabres goes down.

Bandit Spectacles</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Gehna Solbenya, in the house of
thunder, says she will reward you for the return of the binder spectacles
sometimes dropped by bandits in the Karanas. Turn them in for xp, gold, faction
and an item (usually a level 9 spell).

Bard Reports</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The Bard Guild's needs your help in
keeping an eye on the town, if you wish to accept their assignment. Talk to
Juseanus and he will give you two scrolls to deliver. Take one to the North gate
and another to the docks. You may be given scrolls to return as well. Each
delivery is worth a little bit of experience. Also, the following factions will
improve: LeagueofAntonicanBards, KnightsofTruth, GuardsofQeynos. RingofScale and
MayongMistmoore go down. Because you can do this quickly and get a faction hit
for each delivery, this is a good way to improve faction.

Bat Fur</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There's a shop called "The Herb
Jar." If you sit there for a while Caleah Herblender says to one of her
co-workers, "We're out of bat fur again?" Ask her about bat fur. She will then
tell you she is a wizard of the circle of three, and that they need components
to develop new spells. She asks for your help in obtaining ratwiskers, a beetle
eye, and a piece of bat fur so that she can work on a spell she is trying.
Giving all 3 items at once gives you the following faction(she attempts to cast
a new spell, but fails): +OrderOfThree, -BloodSabers, +GuardsOfQeynos,
-OpalDarkBriar. You don't get any other reward other than xp and the
satisfaction of helping out the wizards guild.

The Bayle List</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This a long and involved quest, and
can be started in a number of different places, but revolves around Qeynos,
Surefall and Freeport. The details I was given are still unclear in spots, but
it ultimately resluts in a high powered shadowknight weapon. It involves getting
all three parts of the Bayle List. Each part can also be gotten separately for a
different reward, as listed on the separate quests. (1) For Part one of the
list, talk to Commander Kane in the Shrine of Bertoxxus in Qeynos Catecombs and
he will ask you to deliver blackburrow stout to Barn Bloodstone who is outside
the Golden Rooster in Highpass. Make sure your faction withBarn is at least
indifferent. To raise, do the Letter to Janam/Letter to Rebby quests in the East
FP. If Commander Kane doesn't talk to you at first, just Hail him and say "The
disease is spreading." Then he will bemuch more manageable. Doing so results in
part one of the list. (2) For part two of the list, you need to kill a bear. As
background, you can talk to Runethar Hamest in the Temple of Thunder, who is
investigating corruption among the guards of Qeynos. He asks you to go to
Surefall Glade, find Frenway Marthank in the Druids' Guildtree, and ask him for
"The Bayle List." When you do, Frenway is in a state of depression. His son --
who happened to be carrying the very list you're looking for -- was killed and
devoured by the great grizzly bear Mammoth, who lives deep in the caves of
Surefall Glade. As a Druid, Frenway is forbidden to harm the bears of the Glade,
but he wants vengeance. If you can find and slay Mammoth, you will get a the
Bayle list II. Basically, all you have to do is kill the bear (he is about level
20) and skip the rest. (3) For part three, talk to Raltur Caliskon in the Dismal
Rage in Freeport and he tells you to assist Sir Lucen Delere in any task he has.
But to return any interesting information to him and not Delere. Ralture will
then tell you to kill Lady Shea and get the Bayle List. However, Lady Shea will
tell you that she had the list stolen from her by Dyllin Starshine, who is bound
for Qeynos. He can be found in the smuggler's camp in Highpass. If you have a
high faction or use your influence spell on him, he will give you the list. You
can also get it by killing him, but you will take a bad faction hit from that
that might cause you to not be able to complete the final part of the quest. (4)
Take all three parts to Rathmana Allin in South Ro along with 20 gp and he will
give you back a translated list. If you give this to Pietro Zarn, the
shadowknight guildmaster in the East Freeport Sewers, he will usually reward you
with a <I>Rage War Maul</I> (you may need very high faction with him to get it -
thus you shouldn't kill Dyllin unless you started extremely high). It is
possible that this is used to obtain an even better shadowknight weapon.

Blackburrow Stout Shipment</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The Fish's Ale bartender may mention
that he needs someone to pick up a shipment for him. If you accept, you are
given a note to give to Gnasher Furgutt. Hail Gnasher, give him the note, and he
will give you a shipment of blackburrow Stout. Take it back to the barkeep, and
you get some experience and a free bottle of Stout. (See Gnasher's head quest
for the other side of this) </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020472"></A><BR></DIV>
<A NAME="Heading472"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Blank Scrolls</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The Wizard's Guild needs blank
scroll sheets. Talk to Kazlo and he will ask you to go to Surefall Glade to see
if the druids have any blank scroll sheets. There may be other ways to get them,
but Den Magason (wanders around the dock area) will sell you blank scroll sheets
for 2 gold a sheet. You will not get your money back when you turn them in, but
you will get some xp, faction and some minor coin.

<A NAME="Heading473"></A><H2 ALIGN="LEFT">
Blessed Oil Quest</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This starts in Western Karana by
talking to Brother Estle, located on the road just as you enter the plains. Talk
to him and he will tell you that he is waiting to get some blessed oil, perhaps
to slick down the other monk he is always fighting. Go to the Temple of Life and
talk to one of the priests, who will give you the oil to deliver to the good
monk. Take it back to him for some money, experience, faction with the Priests
of Life and occasionally the Prayer bead quest.

Blurred Map</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Tabure Ahendle, by the arena in
Qeynos, is concerned about a map her apprentice had on him when he was
shipwrecked while crossing over from Erudin. It is possible that you will have
to perform another quest before she tells you this information. On the island in
Erud's crossing, you can kill zombie sailors who will occasionally drop a
blurred map. Give this to her for some coin, xp and a minor item and the
following faction changes: raise Steel Warriors, Guards of Qeynos and Knights of
Truth and Lower Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>There's an NPC named Lashun
Novashine. He's found either on the runway leading up to the flying saucer, or
out wandering around in the newby area. You'll see him shouting out "Cease this
endless conflict ... " If you give him two skeleton bones, he will give you exp
and faction and sometimes cast a healing spell on you. You get the following
faction adjustments: +PriestsofLife, +KnightsofThunder, +GuardsofQeynos,

The Bonethunder Staff</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Runethar Hamest in the Temple of
Thunder is investigating corruption among the guards of Qeynos. He asks you to
go to Surefall Glade, find Frenway Marthank in the Druids' Guildtree, and ask
him for "The Bayle List." He also tells you that if you bring him this list and
the <I>Thunder Staff</I>, he will give you a special reward. Go first to talk to
Frenway in Surefall. When you do, Frenway is in a state of depression. His son
-- who happened to be carrying the very list you're looking for -- was killed
and devoured by the great grizzly bear Mammoth, who lives deep in the caves of
Surefall Glade. As a Druid, Frenway is forbidden to harm the bears of the Glade,
but he wants vengeance. If you can find and slay Mammoth, you will get the list.
Return it and the Mammoth's hide to Frenway and he will in turn give you the
Bayle List II. There are more than a few people in Surefall Glade who will
strike you down for attacking the bears, so be very careful. Once you have the
Bayle list II, you need to get the thunderstaff. You can get this by killing
Drosco the Zombie in the Qeynos Sewers and bring the order of thunder he drops
back to Wolten Graff in the Temple of Thunder. He will give you the
thunderstaff. Take that and the Bayle list II back to Runethar, and he will
reward ytou with you very own <I>Bonethunder Staff</I>.

Breakfast for the Guards</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Two of the guards apparently missed
breakfast. One named Wenbie speaks to you of [Voleen's Bakery] and the other,
Guard Lasen, complains that even when it rains, he gets thirsty. Give a Muffin
to Wenbie, and a Flask of Water to Lasen, and you get some small coin, faction,
and some XP from each of them. It is possible that you may get a brass ring (+1
char waist item) if you give Wenbie enough muffins. You get the following
faction changes for this quest: Antonius Bayle, Merchants of Qeynos and Guards
of Qeynos get better, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Circle of Unseen Hands gets
worse. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020478"></A><BR></DIV>

Broken Lute</H2>

to another npc bard "somewhere in Karana" named Vhalen Nostrolo. Vhalen is
located in South Karanas near a small pyramid, and when you give him the lute,
he gives you a note which you return for a reward (sometimes a bard spell
scroll). </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020479"></A><BR></DIV>

words of Bertoxxulous. If you kill Brother Trintle in West Karanas you discover
that indeed he is now a follower of Bertoxxulous. He has on him Broken Prayer

Camlend's Scythe Quest</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The quest is given by Camlend
Serbold at Qeynos' Temple of Life. You are supposed to bring him the Opal Scythe
(found on Lord Grimrot in SK). The catch is that Lord Grimrot spawns in two
versions- a weak one (level 25 or so) without the scythe, and a BIG level 35
with the scythe. Both have harm touch and all the other appropriate SK
abilities. The big version can solo a cyclops quite easily, and has no problems
making mincemeat out of anything less than a full 35'ish group. The reward for
turning in the scythe to Camlend is actually far less than the value of the
scythe, so it isn't really worth doing. Note: some people have claimed this is
how you get the oaken scimitar, but many others have disputed that claim, so I
wouldn't recommend trying this. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020481"></A><BR></DIV>

The Clothspinner Sisters</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You will occasionally see an NPC
running around outside the gates named Nerissa Clothspinner. Talk to her and
hear her tale of woe. She will tell you that she misses her warrior sister, and
will give you a letter to deliver to her sister somewhere in the Karanas. The
sister is located in East Karana in a cave. Deliver the note to her, and she
will thank you and give you a monogrammed cloth to take back to her sister. She
will then be rewarded for talking to you by being attacked by a guard and
killed. Bet that makes you feel good. If you kill the guard and the sister
lives, she also gives you a veil to give to the sister. When you give the
original sister the cloth she will send you with a note to the Temple of Life.
If you give her the veil, you get a decent item as well. There you may or may
not be rewarded, depending it seems upon your alignment and religion. If you are
of a more evil bent, she may give you a note to deliver to Rihtur Shadowbane in
the Shadowknight guild which provides some xp and the following faction
adjustments: positive Bloodsabres, corrupt qeynos guards and Opal Darkbriar and
negative Guards of Qeynos and Priests of life.

Lempeck, and receive a rusty scyth (Lore item version). Sometimes he goes crazy
and attacks you at this point. I have seen two theories on what makes him attack
you. One theory is that if you don't get the medicine there within a certain
period after you get it it is too late for him and he attacks. The other theory
is that you have to give it to him in the daytime, since lycanthropy is a
nocturnal disease. I would suggest you get sow and do it in the day just to
cover both. Take the scyth back to the Aeston Wemore, and you get the shining
star. Quickest method to complete the quest without all the talking: 1) Give
Kizzie Mintopp 3 honeycombs and 30 gp for the Honey Jum. 2) Take Honey Jum to
Cleric in temple of life (the one who gives the quest) and get Potion in return.
3) Take Potion to Lempeck Hargrim of West Karana and get LORE ITEM RUSTY SCYTH -
NO DROP in return. His house is near the river bank, between the fields. 4) Take
Rusty Scyth back to cleric in temple of life for the shining star of light. You
also receive the following faction changes: Priests of Life, Knights of Thunder,
Guards of Qeynos and Antonius Bayle get better, Blood Sabres gets
worse.</FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020486"></A><BR></DIV>

Diseased Animals</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Priestess Caulria in the temple in
North Qeynos (the one in leather near the back wall) gives the quest, which
requires you to look into the occurrence of rabid wolves in the area. Rabid
wolves and bears are found in the Qeynos Hills. Return a 'diseased wolf pelt' to
her for faction bonuses, experience and a 'cure disease' spell that she casts on
you to purge you of that annoying PlagueRatDisease and Rabies. There are also
rabid grizzly bears in the Hills, and if you return one of the pelts to her, you
get a spell scroll in addition to the faction bonuses. You do not get a cure for
this quest, so make sure you keep a diseased wolf pelt to give to her after the
bear pelts, as rabies is annoying and takes an age to wear off. Sometimes,
fairly rarely, you get a 'fleshy orb' on one of the rabid creatures. Give this
to her, you'll get faction bonuses, some cash, and she'll give you back a lore
version and ask you to take it to someone in Freeport (Lorme Trethadore or
something like that)(Note there is a Lorne Tredore in the academy, but this
doesn't seem to be the right person). Not sure what you get for that yet. You
will also get the following faction adjustments: +PriestsofLife,
+KnightsofThunder, +GuardsofQeynos, -BloodSabers, +AntoniusBayle.

Only at night when she is in Fish's bar. Give her an ogre swill for one; 2)
Hansl Bigoon - Either at his house, or the office of the people; 3) Kane Bayle -
Guard House; 4) Enil Runik - Temple of Life; 5) Guard Leopold - Qeynos Hills,

other people who respond to "donation", but don't seem to cough one up: The
cloth armor salesperson in front of the Lion Mane Inn and Tavern (she says to go
away) in South Qeynos. The two gents who make bags in North Qeynos. A bard in
the Bard's guild (says he donates to his own cause) in South Qeynos. Also in
South Qeynos, a merchant by the Grounds of Fate who only makes three things,
axes I believe. He laughs because of the taxes being so high. Oh, so do the bag
makers. Your reward is usually a spell scroll.

The Escaped Catman</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>This is the quest for the <I>Hero
Bracers</I>. You must do the first part at least once. It is possible that once
you have done the first part, you can just get the shackles each time you do the
quest. You also need to do the Steel Warrior initiation quest before doing this.
You probably need a high faction with the steel warriors to complete the quest.
Here are the details: [1] Go to the basement of the arena in South Qeynos and
talk to Grahan Rothgar. He will ask you if '...you have a report of the [escaped
catman].' Ask him What escaped catman. He will give you the story and ask if you
want to '...[retrieve key seven].' You can continue the quest anyway, but you
will get nothing for it; no faction, no xp, no item, no nothing. [2] Grahan will
tell you to go to Kerra Isle (in Erud's Crossing) and kill the catman named
Nomala. Yes, there is a catman named 'Monola' but that is the wrong catman. The
correct catman is named 'Nomala'. He is not as high level as any of the other
cats but tends to gather a mob. Best strategy to kill him is in Step 3. [3] Go
to Kerra Isle. Nomala will spawn by the fire. Once killed, he will not spawn
again for another hour or two, so figure on taking a while to do this. Anyway,
he will stand there for a bit, then walk off toward the shore down by the dock.
Milla is standing around close by, but if you wait about one minute, she will
walk off and leave Nomala all alone. Kill him - but don't let him run, kill him
quick. Best bet is to hit him once then run a few feet down shore away from
their village. He does not always have the key. [4] Return the key to Grahan and
you get xp, faction, an item (along the lines of a bronze short sword), and a
second quest. [5] The 2nd Quest: He wants you to go hunt down '...a [second
escaped gladiator]' Fine, sounds easy... nope. He wants you to return the
shackles of the Minotaur Hero of the Steamfont Mountains. [6] Go get em and
bring em back. Minotaur Hero + Shackles = Hero Bracers.

Talk to Larsk Juton who has some sort of feud with a gnoll named Gnasher. Too
lazy to do it himself I guess, he wants you to kill his enemy for him. This
gnoll occasionally appears in Qeynos Hills and is around level 10 or so. Kill
him and bring his head back to Lars and you will get some cash and the
Blackburrow Brewers Quest (Surefall). Sometimes when you kill Gnasher Furrgutt,
he is carrying a note from the bartender at Fish's Ale which you can turn in to
the authorities. First, give the note to Larsk Juton (the same person you give
Gnasher's head to). Note that you cannot shortcut this by giving the note to
Captain Tillian directly. He will give you some experience and a faction
adjustment, and advise you to take the note to Captain Tillian in the Arena in
Qeynos (the same one you give Gnoll Fangs to). Captain Tillian will give you
more experience, more faction adjustments, and a Medal of Merit (a Lore Item
which gives you +5 Charisma) for your good deeds. He will then summon the
Executioner, who will proceed to Fish's Ale to carry out the sentence of death
pronounced on the unwise bartender. Follow the executioner and watch the fun.
Another note. If you are carrying gnoll fangs for Captain Tillian, give them to

floor knows the person who last checked it out. When you ask him, he tells you
that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he
was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state. He tells you to go talk to
his sister who is in the Erudin Palace. Once there, she says to meet her just

her brother is still alive. Her brother is at Crows (It seems he is sick and is
in need of some Erud's Tonic. This is a side quest). Ask him about The Testament
of Vanear. He says yes he has it and will sell it to me for 2 gold. If you give
him the 2 gold he gives you the book which has to inventory slots and a combine
button in it. He then laughs and tells you that a thief stole pages 30 and 34
and the book is worthless without them. He also says that the thief sold the
pages to someone named Ran. If you then ask him who Ran is he tells you that Ran
Flamespinner is a librarian in Highpass. If you go to Highpass and ask about The
Testament of Vanear he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named
Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the
uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he
could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell
it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see
a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden
camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dyllin Starsine. Kill
him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the
Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport). Beware that any smugglers around him will
come to his aid. Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard,
+Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers) The
faction hits for him are pretty lagre, so be aware after that of potentially
slipping to KOS in Qeynos. After going back to Qeynos, I went back to Moodoro
and said I want page 34. He said ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty
smart of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I
get it because the work is fiction anyway. He then offers to play a game with
you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a
jester he will give you the page. Along with the jester, you might also draw the
King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight. [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the
dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward]. Once the whole thing is combined you
get the <I>Testament of Vanear</I>, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and
is a no drop lore item. You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return
the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum. (NOTE: I am
told that you can avoid Erudin completely by giving Moodoro Finharn 2gp (the
same guy that you get page 34 from) and he gives you the 2-slot book of the
testament of Vanear. Once you get the book, you can combine the page you get
from Moodoro (by playing his card game) and the other page from Dylin in
HighHold Pass and you've got the book! No need to go to Erudia. And because
Moodoro sometimes hangs out at one of the sewer entrances, evil races could
sneak in and get the book, too.) </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020509"></A><BR></DIV>

items. If you bring him back the scythe and the heart, he may reward you with
the <I>Aegis of Life</I>, a very nice shield. Here is the catch. You need to
have an insane amount of faction to complete this quest. High end warmly is
required. Furthermore, the amount of faction needed to get the quest is not
sufficient to get the item so you will need even more faction or run the risk of
him just taking the scythe and giving you nothing in return. If you really want
this item, I would suggest you do one of the lower end quests at least several
hundred times to raise your faction, and then cross your fingers and hope it is
enough, since there is no way to know if your faction is good enough until you
actually give him the items. </FONT><BR></DIV>

follow: TRIBUNAL - You wish to bring the land of justice for all crimes which
are unpaid. Start your mission in Freeport, where crime is unafraid. KARANA -
You will be safe in this city of thunder. Travel to the catacombs for easy
plunder. TUNARE - From mother of all elves you comfort and peace. Walk into the
crops of Karana and all troubles will cease. VEESHAN - The mother of all wyrms
has her blood running deep withingreat cities. Be aware that you are not alone
in this town of no pity. BRELL - The place of true power is usually beneath your
feet. Stay in this city and a rare enemy you just may meet. INNORUUK - To hate
is your way. Just as the father of the dark race. Go forth to Nekutulos is where
you should go at good pace. PREXUS - He created the Kedge freaks which are now
gone from this land. Go deep into the caves of Jaggedpine and someone will take
your hand. RALLOS ZEK - To die in battle is the true and only way. Go into
Blackburrow and join the fray. BRISTLEBANE - To be like the king of thieves is
the path in which you sway. Go to Crow's after sundown. It is better than in
day. CAZIC THULE - You will find that a slight friend is elvish and dark. Be
forewarned that in this city it is best not to bark. MITHANIEL MARR - As is your
god you are one of true valor which you cannot part. Go forth into the catacombs
and say hail Mister Bloodheart. EROLLISI MARR - To be strong in the way of love
is truly the only way. Go into Karana's Paw and enjoy your day. SOLUSEK - To
step foot upon his land would set your body ablaze. Go far north of Freeport to
find the eye in the day. BERTOXXULOUS - The catacombs contain safe haven for you
and I. It is our place to you I tell no lie (Sounds like Serena is a worshipper
of the Plaguebringer??) RODCET NIFE - The power of healing is brought forth in
your mass. Go past the gates and tell Zutros you are from Highpass. QUELLIOUS -
The tranquility and peace ofthe child lies within your heart. By fighting the
opal elves, you shall be doing your part.

Enchanter that roams the docks. Her name is Danaria Hollin and she wants someone
to go to Freeport to pick up a painting from Palatos Kynarn. He is in E.
Freeport in a very seedy part of town. You hail him and tell that Danaria sent
you for the painting. He says you are waisting your time and all he wants is
Captain. Captain is a drink that you buy from the vendor there. (Captain Jack?)
After giving him 4 he tells you he needs a boat beacon mount. He tells you to go
see the gnomes about getting it. The Gnomes he refers to are the two brothers
Svinal and Lystyn Wyspin who run 'The Emporium' store next to the bank in North
Freeport. The gnomes will tell you basically you will need good skill in
Smithing (About 70+) and several items. Take the Boat Beacon Mount, a Greater
Lightstone, a Metal Disk, and a Copper Band and combine them in a forge. The
Metal Disk and Copper Band are sold by the Gnomes. When combined you get a
<I>Boat Beacon</I> (Lore Item) which can go in the 2nd Melee slot to activate
it. It is a Lantern that casts light like a Greater Lightstone. If you take the
beacon back to Palatos, you gain a small amount of exp, faction and some change.
However, he mentions that Lenka Stouthart, who is by the docks in Freeport, has
some interest in it. If you take the beacon to her, she will give you the
painting (no drop lore item). If you bring the painting back to Palatos, he will
give you a couple of plat for it and the following faction: Heretics down,
Craftkeepers up, High Guard of Erudin up, High Council of Erudin up. There may
be someone else to return it to that gives a better reward.

mumble about someone "foolish going after the Paw of Opolla". When you ask the
companion about it, he tells you to mind your own business, but Micc will tell
him to behave. Ask Micc about the Paw of Opolla and he will tell you it is a
magical item and it belongs to "some gnoll bitch". He will offer to tell you
where to find it if you buy him a brandy. I had to buy 2 to get him to talk. He
then says that someone calling himself Caninel went to find it in the Plains of
Karana. Caniel is located in West Karana, along with two named gnolls, along the
mountains near the border with North Karana. When you talk to Caninel, he will
demand 3 gems before telling you about the Paw of Opolla (Moonstone, Bloodstone,
and a Star Rose Quartz). He will then tell you about how when the humans from
Everfrost first met the Blackburrow Gnolls, the Shaman Opolla greeted them
warmly and had her hand cut off by Gynok Molter. She placed a curse upon the
Molter descendants, the last of which can be found in under Qeynos. He tells you
to ask him about the paw and also about the rings on the paw. When you find him
(Vin Molter), he will demand 3 bottles of Khalish and a rat meat pie for the
paw. He will deny any knowledge of the rings and say that his father probably
sold them, mentioning his father's travels in Odus. You can get the pie in
Qeynos Hills, or you can kill him to get the paw container. This is not the
actual item, since it seems it is the rings that activate its magic. There are
four rings that need to be put in the paw container and combined to get the true
paw: platinum, gold, silver and copper. Look for rings with a +1 xx, -1 char
stat. The platinum ring is on a mummy in befallen named Gynok Moltar. All three
of the other rings can be looted from the Kerran priest Mitty on Kerra Island.
He usually drops the copper one. The silver ring can also be found at the bottom
of the lake in Blackburrow, but it gets picked up pretty quickly after it
spawns. To make sure you have the right ring, cast identify on it and see if it
is a ring of Opolla. </FONT><BR></DIV>

of disease. Ask him "what disease" and he will tell you about a sect called the
plaguebringers whom he fears in infesting Qeynos, but he requires proof of their
presence. Ask him abaout "proof" and he will tell you that he has heard about a
plaguebringer roaming Qeynos Hills, and he wants you to bring him proof of this.
I am not sure what proof he requires, nor what if any rewards he will give for
the proof. There are four plaguebringers in Qeynos Hills: Tovax Vmar, Pyzgn,
Varsoon, Varsoon the Undying. Of these, the only one I know of that drops
something special is Przgn, and nobody is likely to give up their glowing black
stone to see if it does anything here. So the quest is incomplete as of now.

talk to humans. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020537"></A><BR></DIV>

Temple Blankets</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>Chesgard Sydwen (near Temple of
Thunder) will ask you if you are with the [Temple of Thunder] If you say yes
then ask you to take blankets to Follower of Karana. You visit residents of

Tomer's Rescue</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>You probably need high faction with
the monks to do this quest. Tomer Instogle is a Monk hurt near the western walls
outside of Qeynos city. He will tell you that he has been hurt and needs to get
back to his guild in Qeynos. Leave him and go to the Silent Fist Guild in N.
Qeynos City. Talk to Seta Bakindo in the back room. Ask her about Tomer and she
will ask you to escort him back. Go back to Tomer and tell him "I will escort
you back". He will ask you to hold his backpack for him and will follow you.
Take him back to Seta and tell her "I rescued Tomer". Give Tomer back his
backpack for Faction and Exp. This raises faction with Silent Fist Clan and
Ashen Order. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020539"></A><BR></DIV>

Trumpy Irontoe's Head</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After showing your prowess by
killing the zombie Drasco, you will be asked to seek out and kill the halfling
Trumpy Irontoe. Seek him out and bring back his head for some experience and yet
another quest. Warning, you may have to kill Trumpy several times before you
manage to chop off his head. Also, Trumpy seems to be a good friend with
Commander Kane, who will get very upset if you keep killing his little buddy.
The quest is worthwhile for leading to the next quest, but be aware of the
potential consequences. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020540"></A><BR></DIV>

Trumpy Irontoe's Skull</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>After bringing the head of Trumpy
Irontoe to the Necro Guildmaster in Qeynos, he will cast a spell on it and hand
you back his fleshless skull to deliver to Lord Grimrot, who is supposed to be
in a field of skeletons somewhere in the Plains. Grimrot is located in South
Karana, surrounded by some tough and dangerous skeletons. You may have to wait a
while for him to show up so be prepared to fight or hide. The delivery of the
skull will get you a decent amount of experience and gold, as well as an
occasional nice item. </FONT><A NAME="_Toc476020541"></A><BR></DIV>

the Hall of Sorcery. He asks you to collect for him 2 bat wings, 1 snake scale,
&amp; 1 rat whiskers for his Unser's Call. Collect these things for him and you

Vasty Deep Water</H2>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>If you go talk to one of the
Paladins on the top floor of the temple of divine light, he will tell you to
fetch a book from the library. This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep
Quest. The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top
floor knows the person who last checked it out. When you ask him, he tells you
that the person who checked out the book is names Modorro and that he was
executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state. He tells you to go talk to his
sister who is in the Erudin Palace. Once there, she says to meet her just
outside the hotel in town to talk to her. When you meet her, she explains that
her brother is still alive. She'll then tell you how Moodoro got corrupted by a
halfling named Flynn Merrington. They used to sell the valuable Vasty Deep
Water, till Moodoro got caught. Here's where there is a catch, part of getting
to the quest requires asking a question that is not in brackets. Some people may
miss it that way. Nolusia says that she created a doppleganger to die in
Moodoro's place. You must ask Nolusia 'What is a doppleganger' or 'What about
the doppleganger?' Even though it is not in brackets. She'll tell you it died in
Moodoro's place and he relocated to Qeynos, and that she is afraid that he's
started up again because of Flynn. Lanken Rjarn knows, and they're both afraid
that the High Council will learn of it. So she wants to murder Flynn Merrington.
She wants you to return a bottle of Vasty deep water to her, so that she can
poision it to give it to Flynn. If you say yes, she tells you to find out how
they get their Vasty Deep Waters and to bring a bottle to her and she will
poison the lip you are then to take it to Flynn not Moodoro and that will end
everything. You can get Vasty Deep Waters by talking to the Bank manager and
asking him for it (it may be that only an enchanter can use it for this quest
though). He says your guild must have sent you to get it. Bring me a guild coin
and I will give you the water. Go back to the temple and ask for a guild coin
which will be given with the message remember this is not currency. The coin is
a lore item that gives +10 mana. Give this to the banker and he will give you
the water and some experience and some faction. Then go back and gave the water
to the sister.</FONT><BR></DIV>
