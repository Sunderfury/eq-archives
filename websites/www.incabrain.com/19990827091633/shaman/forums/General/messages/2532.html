<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>I think that people misunderstand the purpose of an agility buff.

I believe that it is also a very important stat for determining how often you successfully dodge, parry, riposte, or block (assuming you have those skills).

This is very much speculation now, but I think that the increased agility helps with the chance for them to hit you and perhaps in how much damage you take when hit, more than a couple points of AC would help.  It's been a long time now, so I don't remember the details, but at some point late in the beta or immediately with release they changed the way AC is displayed in your characters stats. For example, a low level/starting gnome magician used to have a NICE AC listed when he started out. I think he had a 50 or 60 AC, which is HUGE for a naked L 1 character. This was because gnomes get an AC bonus for being so small.  At some point (either release or the start of Ph 3.5/Ph 4 I think) a whole bunch of things changed with the way the "AC" stat we can see is calculated. Before the change, for example,  an AC 6 piece of armor gave 6 AC. AFter it, an AC 6 piece of armor can raise your AC by significantly more than 6.  I THINK (but have no way to be certain) that they changed the AC calculation so that "avoidance AC" isn't included in the calculation as directly as it used to be, and that things like Agility have more effect than are directly obvious in the AC stat. <br><br>If anyone else out there from beta remembers this change or can clarify the effect of Agility on combat I'd be MORE than happy to hear more about this.<br><br>Ravenclaw<br>
