<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>: : : As for weapon I use the +5 Totem but if there is a 1H Blunt +WIS weapon out there I am game to get one.

We are all shamans here and there is no reason to hide information from eachother.  We are the best class in this game and we need to work together to prove it. So if you know of any gloves, boots, and a weapon that is +WIS let me know. I will help you in your journey for the perfect equip as well.
