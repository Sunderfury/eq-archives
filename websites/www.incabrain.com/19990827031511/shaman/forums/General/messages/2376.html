<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>: I love my role as Shaman.  It's great helping people and being able to kick some butt at the same time.  However, SoW requests are getting a bit annoying.  I don't feel it's right to charge people for SoW, but at the same time, I'm forced to sit on my butt to med, shouldn't I be compensated for my time?  I'm interested in hearing how others handle the SoW requests. And when was the last time you heard someone say 'thank you' after you did it?<br>_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-<br><br>Ok Just my opinion, but i'll stand by it. <br>   You DO have the Right to charge and needn't feel squirmish about it!  As a matter of fact everytime you give it away you are doing all the rest of us a disfavor.<br>   Lets look at it from a few different angles. First we will go at it from Roleplaying.  Lets hit the Barbarians first.  <br><br>   All barbarian Shamans are followers of Tribunal= Justice.  Not mercy ;)  JUSTICE.  And as as a representitive of the gods ( who have not seen fit to give us much guidelines) you are Judge , Jury, and executioner of this justice.  Is it Just to give away the gifts the Hammers have given you for free?  Is it just that you sit and abstain from advancement and loot while others dash with the spell you provided? Is it just recieve a service with out giving compensation?  Probably Not.<br>   So, you have the right to enforce this. Don't give out your SOW for free. Charge every stranger.  Those who have done you services in the past, or given the gift of friendship, of course have given you a debt you must pay, so you should help them freely and at expense to yourself.<br>   But the fellow who comes up and demands it? "1 platinum Sir.  The Scales Must be Balanced."<br>   Personally I'm too soft hearted to keep to this myself so I let a little mercy temper justice and hope the Tribunal will forgive.  Outside of Halas I give it away to all barbarians below like level 30.  I will even try to persuade them not to give me cash.  We are far from home and have to take care of each other.  I also cast it on anyone who is naked and trying to get their corpse, always free.  Obviously They have just payed their dues to justice already.  And last, I give reduced rate to lower level characters.  1 gold for 1-5 (We learn in the north that adversity makes us strong, and we are doing an injustice to our young if we coddle them too much, but they still deserve a break) 3 gold 5-10 ( same theory), 5 gold 10-15, and 1 plat for 15+.  At 15+ they can easily afford a platinum and the speed we can grant is easily worth that much. It is a Just transaction.  To charge less would be letting ourselves become victims of injustice, even worse WE would be commiting the injustice if only upon ourselves.<br><br>For extremly high level characters... I don't know.  Maybe we ought to send them on quests ;) <br><br>   <br>   For trolls and Ogres even easier. YOU ARE EVIL!  WHY would you ever give ANYTHING away unless it betters the cause of Darkness,Hate, and Destruction? Just Say No.  Sometimes it feels good  to be Bad.<br><br>   OK for the folks just trying to keep a balanced game and having a good time.  <br>   Lets look at this in perspective.  When it comes down to it. All shamans are kind of dumb.  None of us get an even AVERAGE intelligence score. NEXT We are ALL below, again, even AVERAGE Charisma.  Between these two, The big money making  Trade Skills (smithing/jewelry) are basicly out.  We can learn them with dillagence, but consider how much more in time, money, and resources its going to take us. Both in direct Cost (higher costs and lower sale prices due to low Charisma.) But also Opportunity Costs (Extra time spent practicing due to low intelligence, that could have been spent adventuring and gaining Loot and EXP).<br>  SO, we have high costs Spells/weapons/AND banded. And no side source of income availabe like most other class/race combos do.(we have to buy weapons and armor because psychologically others expect us to mix it up at least a little bit or they feel we arn't pulling our weight - It just doesn't seem possible that someone so BIG can't fight a little.)  <br>  Now, If Alchemy filled that role, that would be GREAT! But a) its HARD to find components. b) Folks aren't that interesed in paying big bucks for one use items - how often do YOU see people buying potions at the shops. c) We get it so late that by the time we figure out how to work it the money we could make off of it is relativly piddling compared the costs of the equipment and spells we are buying. d) Its still seems like it needs "fixed" somehow. So Alchemy doesn't act as our "trade skill."  <br>   So what is a poor middling low level Shaman to do?  If he/she/it is smarter than a tro... Um .. Froglock, they examin the economics going on and see that they DO have something that is in high demand, and sell it at the best price the market can handle.  In this case it is Spirit of the Wolf.  We get it earliest, and are one of only 2 classes who CAN get it. Thus its a commodity with Low Supply.  SOW, is a great spell that never loses it usefullness to characters regardless of level.  It can save your life.  It makes tedious travel safer and quicker. Its in High Demand. <br>   SO... Since we have no other method of secondary income we HAVE to sell it.  Both Economicly and for Peace of Mind.  I think the responses on the board have shown how annoying folks find it to have people constantly begging for it.  So, if folks want it. Make sure they know they will have to pay for it.  Everytime you enter a zone just "/auction SOW 1 plat. Free for the Corpseless."  Bang, Everyone knows you have it, Everyone knows not to EXPECT a freebie, and Everyone you knows you are not being a total jerk as you are offering strait up to help folks who REALLY need it.<br>    But, As can be seen, we have to make it a united effort.  If some of us are giving it away, then the ones who charge are seen as jerks. If some of us are selling dirt cheap, then we are screwing our poorer or younger colleages.<br>   Now obviously Friends, Party members, Guildmates are going to get it free :)  And I would suggest you give it out to folks who are roleplaying and have a good IC reason too - folks of your Race who are Playing IC for instance.  Even if You arn't IC at the moment its just courteous not to disrupt Their roleplaying by having one of thier protecters and spirtual guides act like a Renisance Cleric charging for Papal Indulgences.<br> But the stranger who walks up and demands.  Always charge.  The person who begs on shout? Always charge. You are doing both yourself and your bretheren a favor.<br><br>   Whoo.. that got LONG! :P  Anyway Stepping off the soapbox...<br>           Welan. Shaman of the 6 Hammers - Tunare.
