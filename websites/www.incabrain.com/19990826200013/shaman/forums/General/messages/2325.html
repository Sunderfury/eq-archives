<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>I generally do not charge, and I generally do not accept donations.  <br><br>BUT, I am very discriminating about who I will assist.  I will assist anyone in my group.  I will cast SoW or any buffs on any fellow barbarian, and will actively seek such naked brothers seen from a distance clearly retrieving a corpse.  I ask nothing but their pledge to deliver justice to all of Norrath.<br><br>But I also do not aid Dark Elves, ever.  I might assist one if he/she had proven themselves before me in battle, but generally they are sneaky creatures to be avoided.  I might aid a Troll or an Ogre shaman, out of respect, but they would not need it so it has not come up.<br><br>Last night, a level 20 DE Cleric came up to me and said "Hey man, SoW me".  I promptly stood from meding and said "Aid a dark one such as yourself?  Ha, can barely stand to speak with you, let alone aid your evil plots!"  He promptly replied with about 3 expletives and said I was stupid and ran off, tossing in "I was gonna buff you good, too, stupid $&^%# jerk."  I sent him a tell to chill and try roleplay sometimes and not to take it personal.<br><br>He never responded.  Got a nice screenshot of some four letter words in case he or his guild buddies made trouble for me (he seemed pretty ticked and was in an all evil guild, from what my /who indicated).  Anyway, I simply cannot abide presumptous people who come up and demand something.  I never demand anything, and I roleplay when in need of a bind (only 4 bubbles till that is not a problem anymore :))<br><br>Just a lot of jerks out there, I guess...<br><br>Udune<br>Shaman of Veeshan<br><br>: I love my role as Shaman.  It's great helping people and being able to kick some butt at the same time.  However, SoW requests are getting a bit annoying.  I don't feel it's right to charge people for SoW, but at the same time, I'm forced to sit on my butt to med, shouldn't I be compensated for my time?  I'm interested in hearing how others handle the SoW requests. And when was the last time you heard someone say 'thank you' after you did it?<br><br>: <br><br>: Badana<br><br>: Barbarian Shaman<br><br>: lvl 18, Povar<br><br>
