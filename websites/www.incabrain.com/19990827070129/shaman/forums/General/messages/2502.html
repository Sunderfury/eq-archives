<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>When Greyweasel mentions how the number of hits vs. misses factors into the equation, he's referring to the fact that most comparisons between slow and fast weapons of proportional damage take the theoretical case that you hit every single time for full damage. Here's an example:<br><br>Let's say you have<br><br>-Fast Weapon: dmg 4, delay 20<br>-Slow Weapon: dmg 12, delay 60<br><br>(where every 10pts of delay are roughly equal to one second of real-time)<br><br>Theoretically, they should do about the same damage, assuming you always hit, and each time for maximum damage. Let's say you have a 18-second melee (or 180 ticks):<br><br>-with Fast Weapon, you'll get (9 attacks) x (4 dmg) = 36 dmg<br>-with Slow Weapon, you'll get (3 attacks) x (12 dmg) = 36 dmg<br><br>(I know my math isn't holding exactly to formula here, but it's consistent with this example.)<br><br>Now let's take the slightly more realistic case of an 18-second melee where your weapon skill is such that you only miss once (but hit every single other time, and for full damage):<br><br>-with Fast Weapon, you'll get (8 attacks) x (4 dmg) = 32 dmg<br>-with Slow Weapon, you'll get (2 attacks) x (12 dmg) = 24 dmg<br><br>See the difference? In most melee combats (especially if you're a non-melee class like a shaman), you won't always hit with every swing. You'll miss. This reduced total damage in the event of a miss is part of the tradeoff of slower, more powerful weapons vs. faster, weaker weapons (and for the most part, part of the tradeoff between 2H vs. 1H, except for some of the more insanely low delay/high dmg weapons in Lower Guk, Cazic, Kedge, etc.). Many newbie tanks will jump on the rusty halberd (dmg 10, delay 51, I think) over the less impressive rusty longsword (dmg 5, delay 35, I think), but the smart ones will change their tune the first few times they miss in combat and realize how agonizing it is to wait for that next swing.<br><br>-Heavy<br><br>: Well, theoretically that's appropriate when you are talking about lots of swings over an average period of time. But in combats like that you only get so long to fight before you have to run away.<br><br>: <br><br>: My suggestion is that you may want to go with the more frequent swings when you are missing a lot. Lets say that your attack vs his defence gives you a 10% chance to hit each swing. No matter how long you swing for, or how many swings you take, each shot is only going to hit on a 1 in 10 chance. The more swings you take, the more likely your average is going to come out to actually hitting about 10% of the time. The less you take, the more random the case is, and the less likely you get that 10% average. The formula for calculating damage ratio is based on the ideal that you hit constantly and do average damage each time.<br><br>: <br><br>: Each swing is always a 1 in 10 chance. You aren't guaranteed any hits at all in either case, but you are more likely to hit at least some of the time when you take a lot than when you take a few. Combats don't usually last long enough against monsters you are missing a lot against to get to that average. Either you run or you die.<br><br>: <br><br>: <br><br>: : Greyweasel,<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : This agrees with my findings and some earlier posts, but I disagree with the comment about choosing faster weapon speeds because you miss a lot.  If you have a 70% hit rate or a 30% hit rate, your damage ratio will scale by 70% or 30% in each case, for every weapon.  So, higher damage ratio still holds in choosing your weapon.<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : When this MIGHT become a factor is if you were in a group that takes down monsters very,very fast.  In that case, it may *seem* like the faster weapon is better, but that is because you are not looking at enough swings before the monster dies.  So, you might say, gee, I missed 5 out of 6 times and only did 30hp damage before the monster dies.  But, the hit rate will average across all encounters, and if you tracked damage inflicted per 100 swings across all encounters, you should find that the damage ratio still holds.<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : Udune<br><br>: <br><br>: : Shaman of Veeshan<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : Rounds don't exist. You don't lose your "round" by casting a spell. If you cast a spell, you simply wait until the spell is completed before you swing again. That's it.

Melee works in averages in this game, meaning that since there aren't "rounds" you simply attack as often as you can recover from your last swing. Faster weapons attack more frequently for less damage each swing. If you are constantly disrupting your swing by casting spells every combat you are effectively increasing the delay rate of your weapon.<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : <br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : Example: the best way to determine how effective a weapon is in combat is to judge its overall efficiency.

And when you miss a round from casting (i hope i was missing rounds) you down right rarely swing. Don't get me wrong...I love seeing 30 and 28 damage swings. But my question is this, which is more important, delay or damage. That is, is the glowing wooden crook the best 2 hand blunt weapon in the game (for trolls). This is why i ask: If there are two checks in ombat, one to see whether you hit and the other to see for how much, it is better for a shaman, who has lower combat ratings, to swing often becuase we will miss often. <br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : <br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : :     With this reasoning, at 35 delay and 11 damage, th glowing wooden crook seems to be  comparable (at least)and superior (at best) to any of the hammers. I know now that i have the mallet i will still have to break out my rts to max out my 2 hand blunt skill, which is yet another advantage of the crook. And at 11 damage it is not far behind the mallet, it is obviosly superior to the bloodforge hammer and, or reasons stated above, possibly an equal to the ogre war maul. If the mallet could be recharged (and a way must be out there), then that would ad some complexity to discussion.<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : <br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : : Here is another question: Does casting cause you to miss a swing if timed wrong.
