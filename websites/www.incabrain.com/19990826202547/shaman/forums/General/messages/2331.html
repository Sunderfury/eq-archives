<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>Well, theoretically that's appropriate when you are talking about lots of swings over an average period of time. But in combats like that you only get so long to fight before you have to run away.<br><br>My suggestion is that you may want to go with the more frequent swings when you are missing a lot. Lets say that your attack vs his defence gives you a 10% chance to hit each swing. No matter how long you swing for, or how many swings you take, each shot is only going to hit on a 1 in 10 chance. The more swings you take, the more likely your average is going to come out to actually hitting about 10% of the time. The less you take, the more random the case is, and the less likely you get that 10% average. The formula for calculating damage ratio is based on the ideal that you hit constantly and do average damage each time.<br><br>Each swing is always a 1 in 10 chance. You aren't guaranteed any hits at all in either case, but you are more likely to hit at least some of the time when you take a lot than when you take a few. Combats don't usually last long enough against monsters you are missing a lot against to get to that average. Either you run or you die.<br><br><br>: Greyweasel,<br><br>: <br><br>: This agrees with my findings and some earlier posts, but I disagree with the comment about choosing faster weapon speeds because you miss a lot.  If you have a 70% hit rate or a 30% hit rate, your damage ratio will scale by 70% or 30% in each case, for every weapon.  So, higher damage ratio still holds in choosing your weapon.<br><br>: <br><br>: When this MIGHT become a factor is if you were in a group that takes down monsters very,very fast.  In that case, it may *seem* like the faster weapon is better, but that is because you are not looking at enough swings before the monster dies.  So, you might say, gee, I missed 5 out of 6 times and only did 30hp damage before the monster dies.  But, the hit rate will average across all encounters, and if you tracked damage inflicted per 100 swings across all encounters, you should find that the damage ratio still holds.<br><br>: <br><br>: Udune<br><br>: Shaman of Veeshan<br><br>: <br><br>: : Rounds don't exist. You don't lose your "round" by casting a spell. If you cast a spell, you simply wait until the spell is completed before you swing again. That's it. Melee is determined by attack delay and not "rounds".<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : In this way 2H blunt weapons are better to shamans that cast during a melee, since you are disrupting your attacks less, and sometimes not at all. Melee works in averages in this game, meaning that since there aren't "rounds" you simply attack as often as you can recover from your last swing. Faster weapons attack more frequently for less damage each swing. If you are constantly disrupting your swing by casting spells every combat you are effectively increasing the delay rate of your weapon.<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : Example: the best way to determine how effective a weapon is in combat is to judge its overall efficiency. That is determined by using its base attack value and considering its delay rating. A steel great staff with 9 damage and 38 delay has a .237 damage efficiency.

Mallet is better overall in dealing damage to your opponent. Consider that when you are casting spells as well you are delaying the fast attacks far more than the slow ones, and big slow attacks come out far ahead.<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : Bigger weapons are always more efficient in terms of dealing damage and spell casting, but faster weapons have the advantages of interrupting casters, advancing skills faster, and achieving mor hits. The last one may be important if your skill is low and you miss a lot. Damage efficiency is only important when you connect.<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : After using my mallet, it is obvious that it could be better thand the rts, however, even at 44 delay, it hits so slow. And when you miss a round from casting (i hope i was missing rounds) you down right rarely swing. Don't get me wrong...I love seeing 30 and 28 damage swings. But my question is this, which is more important, delay or damage. That is, is the glowing wooden crook the best 2 hand blunt weapon in the game (for trolls). This is why i ask: If there are two checks in ombat, one to see whether you hit and the other to see for how much, it is better for a shaman, who has lower combat ratings, to swing often becuase we will miss often. <br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : :     With this reasoning, at 35 delay and 11 damage, th glowing wooden crook seems to be  comparable (at least)and superior (at best) to any of the hammers. I know now that i have the mallet i will still have to break out my rts to max out my 2 hand blunt skill, which is yet another advantage of the crook. And at 11 damage it is not far behind the mallet, it is obviosly superior to the bloodforge hammer and, or reasons stated above, possibly an equal to the ogre war maul. If the mallet could be recharged (and a way must be out there), then that would ad some complexity to discussion.<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : Here is another question: Does casting cause you to miss a swing if timed wrong. Can it be timed right so that you don't miss a swing (i ussually try to time my casting around a mobs hits)?<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: : : Thanks<br><br>: <br><br>: : <br><br>: <br><br>: <br><br>: <br><br><br>
