<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>Me: level 34 Shaman<br>Friend: level 46 Cleric<br>Enemy: level 42 Neco<br><br>Since I can't hit it with spells, I decide to summon a pet to help deal damage while i heal cleric who's gonna nuke necro.  But, we made a common mistake for those not well versed in pet combat.  We sent the pet in first.  Naturally, this also brought a guard into the combat as well, but that wasn't the problem.  Problem was that the necro ignored my pet, and charmed me.  Made a huge mess, i die, cleric runs for his life, zones.  We regroup, come back, and there's the necro standing there with her pet AND my pet.<br><br>So, what do we do?  Summon another pet, lol.  Then we had cleric initiate with the necro, i sick my new pet on my old pet, and i keep the necro's pet busy, lol.  It was a mess.  Cleric runs out of mana, but necro is near death, we both club her silly, just then another guard walks in, screams bloody murder, and one shot kills.... the necro's personal pet.  Talk about needing a change of shorts.  Then we helped my new pet kill my old pet, since they were still going at it all by themselves.<br><br>Thank VI for removing charm from necros and shaman, makes the world a much safer place.<br><br>Dahl
