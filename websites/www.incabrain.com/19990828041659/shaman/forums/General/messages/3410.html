<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>In East K, you'll find a lot of blues (lion patriarchs, matriarchs, chasm crawlers, even the odd Carrion Spider), but the best exp comes from Gorge Hounds and Shadow xxx (another hound type). You and two others can take those bad boys down. Three others in a pinch. But of course, you may want to use the six person group exp boost, and go after Crag Spiders with six. Crags are tough as nails, but six 15's can kill them. They hit up to L22, but you CAN do it.<br><br>You can also take down Gnoll Reavers and Undead Reavers. Better loot on those than the animal types, but slower exp. You can also get quickly overwhelmed if no one is out there taking them down.<br><br>I'd avoid the griffawns, they do way too much damage for their level. We were dropping yellow hounds at L17 with ease, but the blue griffawns would tear right through us. Not indecent loot on the 'fawns, but not worth the trouble by a long shot.<br><br>Arkand Eagleseeker<br>
