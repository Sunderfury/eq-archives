<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>First let me thank anyone who replies.  <br>Ok Im a troll shaman who because of RL reasons cant play  as much as I would like to (dont we all?).  Anyway I would like to find a place I can gain exp fairly fast enough so I can still group with some friends.  I've tried alot of obvious choices:<br>(1) South Karanas- not a bad place but really boring since its all the same thing.  Burn and melee blue aviaks.  Kite yellow and white rooks.  Also I still believe that a good group always is better for both exp and pure fun.<br>(2) Unrest-  That place sucks unless you are a cleric.  I found that too often High Levels pull the whole house, causing big trains or just hogging all the good mobs.  I tried several groups and found I was spending too much time waiting, killing really small stuff, or running for my life.<br>(3) Not sure about Cazic, went there once and found most people too high to group with.  Another thing but I think that often the worst in people (greed, jealousy, etc.) come out in that place.<br>I  was thinking maybe killing Tentacles in Najena might be good exp. only prob is it cant support many groups( or even one big one) unless you are camping certain NPC's there.<br>SOrry to be longwinded but needed to point out what might be the obvious choices for many.<br><br>Chumpie da Troll Shaman (and still looking for a good last name)
