<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>Druids get their dd spells on the 9s.  They get a 282 at 39, and at 49 they get several, which i think do around 500-600.

I'm GLAD they reduced the damage.  My complaint is that Verant simply lied about it, or decided to not tell us what they were really doing.  I was expecting shorter duration and less damage, but they damage would come faster.  This is what they said they were doing.  Instead, it's far shorter duration, far less damage, and it deals it just as slow as it always did.  They made it sound like a trade off, and instead it was just a kick in the ass.<br><br>Dahlrek Icewrath
