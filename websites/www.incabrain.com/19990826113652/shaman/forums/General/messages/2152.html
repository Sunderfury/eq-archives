<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>: I love my role as Shaman.  It's great helping people and being able to kick some butt at the same time.  However, SoW requests are getting a bit annoying.  I don't feel it's right to charge people for SoW, but at the same time, I'm forced to sit on my butt to med, shouldn't I be compensated for my time?  I'm interested in hearing how others handle the SoW requests. And when was the last time you heard someone say 'thank you' after you did it?<br><br>People that ask questions with multiple ???? immediately gives themselves away as obnoxius/clueless newbies that you can safely ignore if you feel like it. However they are also the ones that doesnt take "no" for an answer, so usually to these guys i just answer "1 plat", and move on with what i'm doing. If they want/need it bad enough they'll pay. And if not, fine, mana saved for me.<br><br>However, there are also other types of people that for instance have a long walk to get their corpse or similar stuff, these guys of course get a free sow whenever possible.<br><br>Rani
