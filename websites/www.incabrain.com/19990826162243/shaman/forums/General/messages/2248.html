<table align=center width=75%><tr><td><br>: But what really chaps my hide is that my Magician friend, lvl 17, is getting even more powerful! Damn.  He already was guaranteed to conjure a yellow pet.  but now his DD spells got more powerful, his pet got even MORE powerful, and can solo REDs without trouble!  Guess who I am grouping with for now on.  We'll sit back and watch his pet take us to lvl 50.<br><br>I also play a magician, so I know a little about this subject.  As you may know, the pets magician summon are around the level of their spell rank.  The relative strength of the pet has NOT changed since the patch, just how they con.  Many magicians at higher lvls disliked the fact the pets they summoned almost always conned blue to them.  GZ stated the reason for this is the /con was based upon mobs, not pc's which apparently are different.  He also stated he would change the way pets con accordingly.  So, the pet change is NOT an increase in hp or lvl of the pet.  The slight increase in spell damage is probably something like 4dmg to 5 dmg.  The pet spells are weak even though they look nice.  This increase in spell strength is probably an attempt to ensure the mage has the strongest pets in the game, (as they should, imo, as it defines the class).  <br><br>On another note, the shaman changes described here have absolutely no effect on my shaman (lvl 22, I know I don't have scourge).  I never used affliction and I still won't, it seems.  Unless you like to kite, I don't see any change in the shaman from the patch.   <br><br>Throm
