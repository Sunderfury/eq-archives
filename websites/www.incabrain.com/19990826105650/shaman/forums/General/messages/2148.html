<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>Maybe I'm lucky, but I am always gracious when people request SOW.  In return, I am usually compensated with information, gold, plat, or return buffs.  I have received 3pp for a sow on two occassions, and 2pp on numerous occassions.  That makes up for a lot of med time.  I cast sow on anyone I've ever fought with for free when I see them, and they, in turn, bring me things I need when they get them.  It seems to work out well.  The few people I've met that get demanding, I have ignored, no detriment to me.  The ones that pay the most seem to be the ones that shout "Can someone give me a sow for a long journey?"  I also give sow to anyone who asks who is retrieving a corpse.  Some thoughts for ya.  Lolo, Level 13, Innourouk<br><br><br><br>: I love my role as Shaman.  It's great helping people and being able to kick some butt at the same time.  However, SoW requests are getting a bit annoying.  I don't feel it's right to charge people for SoW, but at the same time, I'm forced to sit on my butt to med, shouldn't I be compensated for my time?  I'm interested in hearing how others handle the SoW requests. And when was the last time you heard someone say 'thank you' after you did it?<br><br>: <br><br>: Badana<br><br>: Barbarian Shaman<br><br>: lvl 18, Povar<br><br>
