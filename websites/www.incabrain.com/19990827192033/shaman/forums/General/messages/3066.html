<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>It may not be the 'best spell in the game' but I like Frenzy (and Burst of Strength) spells.  Frezy is specifically usefull for long battles when you run out of mana.  User your last 25 or so mana to cast Frenzy.  At level 19 it makes a very noticable difference.  You didnt mention this but it also increases attack speed--with my delay 50 Bloodforge hammer, my attacks exactly keep up with those of wolves in East Karanas.  This is _much_ faster.  Plus with strength bonus I hit for full damage almost everytime I hit and AC bonus reduces hits.  Last but not least HP regeneration is faster so I sometimes end up the fight with more HP that before I cast Frenzy.
