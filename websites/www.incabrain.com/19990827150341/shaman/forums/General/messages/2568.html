<table align=center width=75%><tr><td>I mentioned this technique (buff timing) in my post (hard to find because it is so long I know).  It does help but it tends to fall down very quickly since lvl 15 or so (hopefully it will get easier is our buffs start to outdistance other classes by a wider margin from what I can tell).  The reason this technique falls down as what Seerena mentioned in her post below, other characters start to get and use buffs that cancel out ours.  This is more pronounced because no other class's primary function is to Buff.  I find that other classes tend to be very haphazard(sp?) about when/who they buff.  It is hard to get them to follow the orderly techniques that Shaman tend to learn and use.  The worst case is when another player casts a powerful 5 minute (for example) buff that overrides your weaker long term buff.  5 minutes later they have no buff at all and you often have no idea it happened, wasting both players mana and reducing the groups effectiveness.<br><br>The other problem when real-virtual-life intrudes--interuptions:<br>1. Player leave and a new player joins, can happen frequently sometimes.  And people are never courteous to come and go in sync with your buffing schedule either : )<br>2. Group is jumped in the middle of buffing by train or rare spawn etc.  You either have to pick up where you left off or go with what you have if the groupe is inpatient.<br>3. Most common for me unfortunately, bad lure.  Leave to soon, dont let ya buff then, bring back stuff when you are not ready, etc.  <br>-OFF TOPIC-<br>I know, find a better group.... well more often that not I can not find a perfect group in my limited play schedule.  I can only play at certain times and can not change that to meet up with the good players I know (and there are plenty).  In 2 hours of play time it is hard to get one group going and have time to do much.  If I look to long I end up being with a good group for 15 minutes and leaving. Not fun.<br>-OFF TOPIC-<br><br>So if you have a great regular group to play with, I do not think you would be so worried.  But I, even though I have many good friends on EQ, do not have a regular group (if someone lvl 19ish plays from 8:30 to 10:30 Monday thru Thursday let me know :) ).  And I believe many people do not.  For us, anything that can make organizing a group easier will help us have more fun.  <br><br>Haroun<br>Shaman on Tunare<br><br>: You cast spell on yourself and on others at the same time.  Start with you.  As soon you see yours wearing out, that means you have to rebuff others.  Easy.<br><br>: <br><br>: Max<br><br>
