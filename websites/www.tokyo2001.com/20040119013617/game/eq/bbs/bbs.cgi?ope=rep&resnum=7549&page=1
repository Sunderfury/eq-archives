>Al'Kabor's Continuing Research
>
>While collecting mineral samples for his fusibility experiments, 
>Al'Kabor noticed that the quadrolith that stands in the Great Divide 
>of Velious was not emitting any magical energies as the ones found 
>within the old world and Kunark.
>He needed to continue studying the structure and thus enlisted a 
>knowledgeable wizard to aid him with the collecting of the fusible 
>ore that he left in the caverns of the shardwurms in the Great 
>Divide.
>
>The wizard traveled to the shardwurm caves and was greeted by the 
>Guardian Monell.
>The Guardian mentioned that he and his brethren protected the land 
>from intruders and that the velium within the land was too sacred to 
>be tampered with, despite its claim of ownership by Al'Kabor.
>
>Reports have said that the Guardian was slain with relative ease and 
>Al'Kabor retrieved the samples that were needed for his continued 
>research of the apparently &quot;dead&quot; quadrolith.
>It would later be known that Al'Kabor had been successful with 
>experiments that he performed with the fusible coral, earthen, 
>igneous, and velium ores that enabled him to create a scepter of 
>extraordinary potential that when held , the magical energy of the 
>scepter expands the mind while providing a greater protection from 
>the elements.
>
>This magnificent artifact has been entrusted to one of the wizards 
>who had proven themselves capable and intelligent enough to be 
>trusted to wield such an incredible artifact.
