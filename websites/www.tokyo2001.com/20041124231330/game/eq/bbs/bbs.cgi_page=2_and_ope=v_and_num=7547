The End of the Child of Hate?<BR>
<BR>
Many of you know because you got caught up in it, some of you even <BR>
lost one close to you, but it appears we may have seen the last of <BR>
Lanys T'Vyl.<BR>
A huge battle erupted in middle of Rathe Mountains between those <BR>
Teir'Dal still loyal to Lanys and Neriak itself.<BR>
No one is sure, but one would have to assume that Thex had simply had <BR>
enough of her games.<BR>
The battle was fierce as the Dark Elves cut each other down by the <BR>
dozens upon dozens.<BR>
Reports say that it was only the intervention of Mayong Mistmoore <BR>
himself that stopped the fighting.<BR>
<BR>
That is hardly all though.<BR>
Our sources confirm that Innoruuk himself made an appearance after <BR>
the struggle and this is the part we should all be wary of.<BR>
None outside of the very Plane of Hate can be certain, but the <BR>
evidence suggests that there is a successor to Lanys' position at the <BR>
right hand of the Prince of Hate.<BR>
This is something that we will be watching closely.<BR>
Let us all give a prayer to the Earth Mother that Firiona will be <BR>
strong enough to face this new threat down as she did Lanys back in <BR>
the battle for Kithicor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Advancements in the Fusible Ore Sciences.<BR>
<BR>
The famed wizard Al'Kabor has once again made a great stride in the <BR>
magical sciences.<BR>
After experimenting with fusible coral, earthen, igneous, and velium <BR>
ores, the fruit of the Erudite's labors produced a scepter of <BR>
wondrous proportions.<BR>
Only time will tell if these advancements will be something that he <BR>
sees fit to share with all of Norrath.<BR>
In the meantime. should you see a wizard running around with a <BR>
shovel, there is a chance that it is Al'Kabor's scepter cleverly <BR>
disguised so that it does not fall into the wrong hands.<BR>
