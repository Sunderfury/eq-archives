Priest of Life Bring Hope: <BR>
Plague to End Soon?<BR>
-----------------------------<BR>
The Priests of the Temple of Life bring citizens of Qeynos and Karana <BR>
residents new hope this week as they announce their commitment to <BR>
finding a way to bring an end to the terrible plague that has caused <BR>
us so much heartbreak as of late.<BR>
<BR>
One radical idea in development is to use a sort of &quot;anti-disease&quot; <BR>
enchantment that spreads much in the same way as a disease.<BR>
However it does not sicken those that come in contact with it.<BR>
Rather it leaves them perfectly healthy and disease free.<BR>
The enchantment is currently imperfect and dissipates too quickly to <BR>
be of any real use right now.<BR>
<BR>
The followers of Rodcet Nife have put out a call to anyone that has a <BR>
sharp mind and a head for research for assistance with their tests as <BR>
they attempt to refine the enchantment .<BR>
Anyone interested in assisting should contact Velarte Seline for more <BR>
information.<BR>

Al'Kabor Continues Research<BR>
-----------------------------<BR>
Reports have reached the Times that premier Wizard Al'Kabor continues <BR>
his scientific research.<BR>
His latest discovery relates to the ability to fuse together several <BR>
different compounds using a combination of standard alchemical <BR>
practices and good old fashioned wizardry.<BR>
The compound is created from substances not naturally combinable <BR>
without the use of Al'Kabor's secret process and is incredibly <BR>
strong.<BR>
The compound also seems to dramatically increase the flow of magical <BR>
energy to any who remain in contact with the compound.<BR>
Al'Kabor used the compound to contruct a Sceptre of incredible power.<BR>
<BR>
Apparently, this sceptre was given to an individual who was very <BR>
helpful in assisting Al'Kabor in his studies.<BR>
Regardless of this artifact's incredible power, no doubt it is viewed <BR>
as a mere trinket to the mighty wizard.<BR>
