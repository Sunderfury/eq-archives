Paineel、Cold Ironの残りの部分のLogを取ってきました。<BR>
<BR>
　Warrensで出た Large Empty Crate を渡します。<BR>
<BR>
Royal Guard Sheltuin says 'Hmmm. Very odd. The dust in the crate <BR>
implies some sort of stone was transported in it. Perhaps our <BR>
brothers of the Arcane will be able to find out where this dust came <BR>
from and what it's used for. Take this dust sample and note to <BR>
Keletha Nightweaver. She will examine the dust and send you back with <BR>
a report. Make haste. <BR>
You gain experience!!<BR>
<BR>
　Envelope with the dust sample をNECGuildのKelethaに渡しにいきます。<BR>
<BR>
Keletha Nightweaver takes the note, dumps the dust into her hand and <BR>
examines it for a moment. She looks up and chuckles, then says, 'It's <BR>
amuzing how one of our Royal Guards cannot identify this substance. <BR>
Do you feel how it's slightly cooler than other metals? It's called <BR>
Permafrost Iron, also known as Cold Iron to laymen. Miragul wrote of <BR>
it's properties in his memoirs. There are much better metals at our <BR>
disposal now, so it's use is rare except in more primitive cultures. <BR>
Here is my report.' <BR>
You gain experience!!<BR>
<BR>
　Heretic's ReportをもってSheltuinのところに戻ります。<BR>
<BR>
Royal Guard Sheltuin 's eyes redden with intense anger after reading <BR>
the report. When he speaks, his voice is suprisingly calm and <BR>
measured. He says, 'Listen close Erudite. When you leave this <BR>
building, you will find the courier who is bringing the ore. You will <BR>
kill him, and collect his head and a box of the ore. You will then <BR>
find the supplier, and collect his head and any other information you <BR>
find on him. Bring me these four things and you will be rewarded. Do <BR>
not fail.' <BR>
You gain experience!!<BR>
