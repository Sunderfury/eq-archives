Al'Kabor's Continuing Research<BR>
<BR>
While collecting mineral samples for his fusibility experiments, <BR>
Al'Kabor noticed that the quadrolith that stands in the Great Divide <BR>
of Velious was not emitting any magical energies as the ones found <BR>
within the old world and Kunark.<BR>
He needed to continue studying the structure and thus enlisted a <BR>
knowledgeable wizard to aid him with the collecting of the fusible <BR>
ore that he left in the caverns of the shardwurms in the Great <BR>
Divide.<BR>
<BR>
The wizard traveled to the shardwurm caves and was greeted by the <BR>
Guardian Monell.<BR>
The Guardian mentioned that he and his brethren protected the land <BR>
from intruders and that the velium within the land was too sacred to <BR>
be tampered with, despite its claim of ownership by Al'Kabor.<BR>
<BR>
Reports have said that the Guardian was slain with relative ease and <BR>
Al'Kabor retrieved the samples that were needed for his continued <BR>
research of the apparently &quot;dead&quot; quadrolith.<BR>
It would later be known that Al'Kabor had been successful with <BR>
experiments that he performed with the fusible coral, earthen, <BR>
igneous, and velium ores that enabled him to create a scepter of <BR>
extraordinary potential that when held , the magical energy of the <BR>
scepter expands the mind while providing a greater protection from <BR>
the elements.<BR>
<BR>
This magnificent artifact has been entrusted to one of the wizards <BR>
who had proven themselves capable and intelligent enough to be <BR>
trusted to wield such an incredible artifact.<BR>
