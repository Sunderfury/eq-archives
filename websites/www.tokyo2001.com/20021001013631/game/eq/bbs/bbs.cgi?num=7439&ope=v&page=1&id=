The End of the Plague?<BR>
----------------------------<BR>
In a word : no. <BR>
The Powers that be in Qeynos have once again allowed what was in our <BR>
sights to slip into who-knows-when.<BR>
It seems that there was some progress finally being made towards <BR>
ridding the vast Karanas of the touch of death in the form of a <BR>
magic-based &quot;anti-plague&quot; as it was being referred to.<BR>
Now there was still some work that needed to be done as the magic <BR>
simply would not hold for an appreciable period of time , but now the <BR>
poor animals that they were testing with have been stolen!<BR>
Yes , I said stolen.<BR>
Citizens , be glad you are safe within the walls of the city of men, <BR>
where your food is plague-free and your animals are safe.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
War<BR>
----------------------------<BR>
The Teir'Dal are fighting amongst themselves again and now they seems <BR>
to have done away with one of their most famous faces.<BR>
Reports are coming in from all over that Lanys T'Vyl was sacrificed <BR>
to their despicable God Innoruuk.<BR>
Always difficult outside of Neriak to decipher the politics of a race <BR>
founded in hate, one is left to assume that the tensions between <BR>
Lanys and the Royalty of Neriak had run their course, as gad seemed <BR>
to be coming judging by the recent scuffles in the Commonlands.<BR>
We are expecting word soon on the current state of Teir'Dal <BR>
population in the Commonlands outside of Befallen.<BR>
<BR>

Boomba's Recipe of the week:<BR>

Vegitable Roughy<BR>
1 Red Roughy<BR>
1 Vegetables<BR>
1 Jug of Oyster Sauces<BR>
1 Kelp Garnish<BR>
