Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Good citizens of Thurgadin, hear me! Our <BR>
city, our people, our very lives are in danger this day. The Kromrif <BR>
are at this very moment marching towards us in an offensive they hope <BR>
will bring about our demise... <BR>
<BR>
Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'I hereby command, by authority of Dain <BR>
Frostreaver the Fourth, that all able bodied Coldain fight to the <BR>
death in defense of our land. Children, disabled citzens, and <BR>
unseasoned travellers are advised to evacuate immediately! <BR>
<BR>
Zrelik the Scout is surrounded by a brief lupine aura.<BR>
<BR>
Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'My fellow soldiers, take heart! For we are <BR>
not alone in this endeavor. One among us, an outlander, has earned <BR>
the title Hero of the Dain for valiant service to our people. This <BR>
newcomer has brought with him allies that will fight alongside you to <BR>
help bring about our victory. <BR>
<BR>
Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'My friends... Brell did not place us here <BR>
so many centuries ago to be slaughtered by these heathens. Nor did <BR>
our forefather, Colin Dain, sacrifice himself simply to have us fail <BR>
here now. Through these events we were brought to this day to test <BR>
our strength and our faith. <BR>
<BR>
Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'Will we be shackled together to slave away <BR>
in Kromrif mines or will we stand united and feed these beasts <BR>
Coldain blades? By Brell I promise you, 'It is better to die on our <BR>
feet than to live on our knees!' <BR>
<BR>
Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'TROOPS, TAKE YOUR POSITIONS!! <BR>
<BR>
Narandi the Wretched shouts 'No need to pray to your little God <BR>
stumpymen, you'll be meeting him in person soon enough! <BR>
<BR>
Seneschal Aldikar shouts 'You'll be begging Brell for forgiveness by <BR>
the day's end, vile beast! <BR>
<BR>
Narandi the Wretched shouts 'Kromrif! Form up! Dispatch these tiny <BR>
fools and destroy Thurgadin. Theres a keg of ice mead waiting for <BR>
every man back at home.
