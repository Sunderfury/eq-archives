How the Mighty Fall!<BR>
<BR>
Lanys T'Vyl , former sweetheart of the Teir'Dal, was slain by the <BR>
people she once held in thrall!<BR>
An epic battle took place in Rathe Mountains.<BR>
Lanys's forces clashed against the mighty army of Neriak.<BR>
After a bloody battle, the former chosen was subdued and captured<BR>
<BR>
Reports indicate that after capture, she was taken back to Neriak <BR>
where a terrible ritual sacrifice took place.<BR>
Rumors say that Innoruuk himself appeared that day and removed the <BR>
last of her life force personally<BR>
<BR>
A schism still seems to exist Teir'Dal society with many vowing to <BR>
continue to follow Lanys, if only in memory.<BR>
Reports are flooding in that already a large outpost is in the <BR>
process of being constructed by these still rabid and devote <BR>
followers of the dead woman.<BR>
This reporter thinks they should just get over it and move on <BR>
already!<BR>
