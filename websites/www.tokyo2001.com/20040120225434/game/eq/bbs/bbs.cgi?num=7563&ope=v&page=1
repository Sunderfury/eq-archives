Royal Edition<BR>
<BR>
The Child of Hate<BR>
<BR>
Deep in the heart of Neriak, The king and Queen held a war council <BR>
against Lanys T'Vyl and her followers.<BR>
During the council , Mayong Mistmoore appeared in an obvious fit of <BR>
rage toward the Crimson Triad.<BR>
He informed The Royals of Lanys T'Vyl's ritualistic ceremony in which <BR>
resulted in the capture of his minion Khasra Vei'Ras.<BR>
He informed them of Lanys' location and of her intention to complete <BR>
Malevolence in the Rathe Mountains, Lanys was preparing to complete <BR>
the ritual.<BR>
The Crimson Triad interrupted her and a great battle began.<BR>
The battle was long and bloody.<BR>
Growing tired and angrier by the wait, Mayong Mistmoore appeared, <BR>
knocking Lanys T'Vyl unconscious.<BR>
He then Grabbed Malevolence.<BR>
With the Bloodmoon in hand, he completed Malevolence.<BR>
He then placed it in the hands of the archpriest, Dorvias N'Keth and <BR>
told the Crimson Triad to complete the sacrifice of the Lanys T'Vyl.<BR>
<BR>
Instructed by the King and Queen, Ashteth T'Dral and Dorvias N'Keth <BR>
quickly began the sacrificial ceremony.<BR>
Upon the appearance of the Avatar of Hate, He took Malevolence from <BR>
the hands the Archpriest with instructions to venture to the Plane of <BR>
Hate when he is summoned.<BR>
<BR>
Once the ceremony was completed, The King made the following <BR>
announcement in Neriak:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Loyal Teir'Dal. <BR>
The time has come for our nation to move on to greatness.<BR>
Neriak has conquered over the armies of Lanys T'Vyl.<BR>
At last, the sacrificial ceremony has been performed in the name of <BR>
our father.<BR>
The Avatar of Hate has absorbed her essence and power.<BR>
Valizrae D'Tora, the new chosen, has been freed and is now beginning <BR>
her training to become the new child of hate.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lanys's minions, outraged by the sacrifice of their leader, are <BR>
quickly constructing a temple in her honor.<BR>
The King and Queen showed no concern over this factor.<BR>
