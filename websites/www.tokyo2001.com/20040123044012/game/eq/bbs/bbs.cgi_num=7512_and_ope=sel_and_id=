<tr><td colspan=4 bgcolor="#000042"><br>猫村のそばに一匹だけSensetheDeadに反応する赤いWispがいました。<BR>名前はa spirit。<BR><BR> You say, 'Hail, a spirit'<BR> a spirit flares brightly as you attempt to speak with it. By <BR>listening very closely you're brely able to make out it's frantic <BR>whispering. It keep refering to one of the Kejekans, one that <BR>apparently slew him as he attempted to cleanse the land of them. It <BR>wants nothing more than to destroy who killed him, but it cannot in <BR>this [form]. <BR> You say, 'what is form'<BR> a spirit flares brightly again as it explains there isn't enough <BR>time for it to explain. It then begins to whisper again, telling you <BR>that it commands you the aid it in it's revenge. You make out, <BR>through the barely audible whispering, that if you do help it, you <BR>will be rewarded. <BR> You say, 'what is revenge'<BR> a spirit whispers that he will need to become whole again before he <BR>can defeat the fool animal that slew him. The spirit admits to one <BR>mistake before coming here to wipe the Kejekans. In an earlier <BR>campaign, he lost a very powerful weapon. That weapon would enable <BR>him to take on a form likened to his former self. If you return this <BR>weapon to the spirit, and then help him to defeat his enemy, the <BR>reward will be yours. <BR>
