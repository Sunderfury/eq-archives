お酒とNoteを渡すと<BR>
<BR>
Taldrik Stumpystout says 'Ah ha! So ye are Bronlor`s chosen aye? Well <BR>
den these fine brews can only mean one thing! Yep its dat youre a <BR>
drinker like meh! Arg, if I only had me recipe. <BR>
<BR>
You say, 'what is recipe'<BR>
<BR>
Taldrik Stumpystout says 'Well ya see lad I had an ancient recipe <BR>
passed down to me that told one how to create the holiest of ale. Its <BR>
far gone now, however I recently had a vision of the ingredients and <BR>
where they might be found. Do you wish to seek out the components for <BR>
me? <BR>
<BR>
You say, 'i wish to seek out the components'<BR>
<BR>
Taldrik Stumpystout says 'Excellent lad! Let meh see here if I can <BR>
remembur correctly. I know that you need to Preserved hops and a <BR>
Battleworn cantine. I know that these were carried by my good friend <BR>
Torklar back when I was still a young lad in training like you. However <BR>
one day he adventured to an undead estate with a friend of his that was <BR>
a very skilled brewer. I believe they went there in search of some <BR>
ingredients they needed for a recipe however neither of them ever <BR>
returned. But before you go any further I must tell ye that you will <BR>
need a specific kind of cask to combine these items in. <BR>
<BR>
You say, 'what is a specific kind of cask'<BR>
<BR>
Taldrik Stumpystout says 'Why a holy cask is what ye will need of <BR>
course! Find the ingredients that I asked you for before and combine <BR>
them within this holy cask along with barley from the forests of <BR>
Kithicor and water summoned from none other then yourself. After doing <BR>
this if the gods have smiled upon you a thick and hearty keg of Brells <BR>
Blessed Stout will be created. Give this to me along with a Rat <BR>
sandwich to enjoy while I sip the finest of ales as well as your <BR>
Initiate symbol that you carry now and I will be sure to reward you. <BR>
