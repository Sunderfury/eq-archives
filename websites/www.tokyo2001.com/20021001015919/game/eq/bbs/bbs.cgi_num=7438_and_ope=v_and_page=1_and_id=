- Al'Kabor -<BR>
<BR>
That wizardy sort , Al'Kabor , has made 'imself a powerful artifact <BR>
scepter from the one that he had been diggin' up from ground in <BR>
several places.<BR>
His research has somethin' to do with fusiblatily .. or somthin' like <BR>
that.<BR>
<BR>
Al'Kabor called forward an assistant to safeguard the scepter - most <BR>
likely another blaster.<BR>
Hehe .. he runs through assistants quickly these days.<BR>
Iffin' I was a wizardy sort, I wouldnae be so quick to volunteer to <BR>
help him.<BR>
<BR>
He dinnae rightly be trustin' many folks though.<BR>
We did hear that he does have an assistant that he trusts the most <BR>
though.<BR>
Makil Rargon is his name.<BR>
<BR>
Thubr Axebringer assured us that he'd let the king known of anything <BR>
further.<BR>

- The Plague in Qeynos -<BR>
<BR>
Head up by Velarte Seline , the priests in Qeynos have been busy <BR>
tryin' to rid themselves of the plague in the Karanas.<BR>
<BR>
They have been testin' all sorts of anti-disease curin' things on <BR>
animals.<BR>
Some of der experiments have been halted because a thief stole some <BR>
of the animals they were testin' on.<BR>
<BR>
King Kazon announced that we might be sendin' a few of our own priest <BR>
there to assist them with it.<BR>
<BR>
