>Priest of Life Bring Hope: 
>Plague to End Soon?
>-----------------------------
>The Priests of the Temple of Life bring citizens of Qeynos and Karana 
>residents new hope this week as they announce their commitment to 
>finding a way to bring an end to the terrible plague that has caused 
>us so much heartbreak as of late.
>
>One radical idea in development is to use a sort of &quot;anti-disease&quot; 
>enchantment that spreads much in the same way as a disease.
>However it does not sicken those that come in contact with it.
>Rather it leaves them perfectly healthy and disease free.
>The enchantment is currently imperfect and dissipates too quickly to 
>be of any real use right now.
>
>The followers of Rodcet Nife have put out a call to anyone that has a 
>sharp mind and a head for research for assistance with their tests as 
>they attempt to refine the enchantment .
>Anyone interested in assisting should contact Velarte Seline for more 
>information.

>Al'Kabor Continues Research
>-----------------------------
>Reports have reached the Times that premier Wizard Al'Kabor continues 
>his scientific research.
>His latest discovery relates to the ability to fuse together several 
>different compounds using a combination of standard alchemical 
>practices and good old fashioned wizardry.
>The compound is created from substances not naturally combinable 
>without the use of Al'Kabor's secret process and is incredibly 
>strong.
>The compound also seems to dramatically increase the flow of magical 
>energy to any who remain in contact with the compound.
>Al'Kabor used the compound to contruct a Sceptre of incredible power.
>
>Apparently, this sceptre was given to an individual who was very 
>helpful in assisting Al'Kabor in his studies.
>Regardless of this artifact's incredible power, no doubt it is viewed 
>as a mere trinket to the mighty wizard.
