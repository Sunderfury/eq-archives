>The End of the Child of Hate?
>
>Many of you know because you got caught up in it, some of you even 
>lost one close to you, but it appears we may have seen the last of 
>Lanys T'Vyl.
>A huge battle erupted in middle of Rathe Mountains between those 
>Teir'Dal still loyal to Lanys and Neriak itself.
>No one is sure, but one would have to assume that Thex had simply had 
>enough of her games.
>The battle was fierce as the Dark Elves cut each other down by the 
>dozens upon dozens.
>Reports say that it was only the intervention of Mayong Mistmoore 
>himself that stopped the fighting.
>
>That is hardly all though.
>Our sources confirm that Innoruuk himself made an appearance after 
>the struggle and this is the part we should all be wary of.
>None outside of the very Plane of Hate can be certain, but the 
>evidence suggests that there is a successor to Lanys' position at the 
>right hand of the Prince of Hate.
>This is something that we will be watching closely.
>Let us all give a prayer to the Earth Mother that Firiona will be 
>strong enough to face this new threat down as she did Lanys back in 
>the battle for Kithicor.
>
>
>
>Advancements in the Fusible Ore Sciences.
>
>The famed wizard Al'Kabor has once again made a great stride in the 
>magical sciences.
>After experimenting with fusible coral, earthen, igneous, and velium 
>ores, the fruit of the Erudite's labors produced a scepter of 
>wondrous proportions.
>Only time will tell if these advancements will be something that he 
>sees fit to share with all of Norrath.
>In the meantime. should you see a wizard running around with a 
>shovel, there is a chance that it is Al'Kabor's scepter cleverly 
>disguised so that it does not fall into the wrong hands.
