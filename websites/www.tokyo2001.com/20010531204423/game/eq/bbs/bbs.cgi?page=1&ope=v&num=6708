Seneschal Aldikar says 'Garadain will post his men in the gorge to <BR>
the east. Churn and his men will await your command in the caves to <BR>
the west. Dobbin will have his forces at the ready in the clearing <BR>
directly south of here near the towers. If any Kromrif make it to his <BR>
vicinity he and his men will attack with or without your command. <BR>
<BR>
Seneschal Aldikar says 'Lastly, Corbin will hide his men in the worm <BR>
caves to the south, call on him for a surprise attack. Remember where <BR>
these men are stationed, outlander. Should they call out for help you <BR>
may wish to send some of your people to aid them. <BR>
<BR>
Seneschal Aldikar says 'The leader of this invasion is a powerful <BR>
Kromrif named Narandi. Rumor has it that he is more powerful than any <BR>
ten of his peers. He must fall. When he is slain you must show his <BR>
head and the ninth ring to me. <BR>
Seneschal Aldikar says 'Scout Zrelik here will follow you and serve <BR>
as your herald. He will relay your orders to the troops. Show me your <BR>
ninth ring now to verify your identity and I will give you the orders <BR>
to memorize. <BR>
<BR>
Seneschal Aldikar says 'Commit these orders to memory, (name) , have <BR>
them ready to speak at a moment's notice. When you are finished <BR>
memorizing, repeat them to me. Tell your soldiers to prepare <BR>
themselves. When the orders are handed to Zrelik we will take up our <BR>
positions. <BR>
