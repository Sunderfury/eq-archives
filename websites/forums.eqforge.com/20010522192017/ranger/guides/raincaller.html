                Rain Caller Quest Guide. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
                get a Rain Caller you need 4 things. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1, 
                A Trueshot Longbow.<br>
                2, a Treant heart. <br>
                3, A bag of gold Faerie dust. <br>
                4, 3000 gp. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Treant 
                heart: Turn in small lanterns to Jyle in West FP until he gives 
                you a heart. You will usually get it after a few lanterns. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bag 
                of Faerie dust: Go to the Faerie princess in L Fay and ask her 
                about the dust. She's on a weird despawn/respawn cycle, the placeholder 
                is to Gearheart's left, just wait around a while and she will 
                eventually show. She tells you her wing was stolen by a gnome 
                and she wants it back before she will give you the dust. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                gnome who stole it is Sanfryd, in the back of Ak'Anon, outside 
                the necro guild. When you hail him and ask him about it he says 
                he wants it to grow back his hair, and that he has no friends, 
                etc. Tell him that you are his friend, and I think there's a little 
                more dialog, and he will give you a box to fill with 10 Hair tonics. 
                A gnome in a tent sells the hair tonics outside of West FP. Buy 
                10 hair tonics, put them in the box in separate slots, and hit 
                combine. Then bring the box back to him. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
                you give him the box he gives you a tattered toupee, which he 
                wants fixed before he will give the wing back. To fix it you need 
                to go to the hair tonic seller and ask him to repair the toupee. 
                The hair tonic seller will say he needs 3 things first. He wants 
                2 clumps of gorilla hair and 1 piece of hair from the golden haired 
                mermaid in Kedge. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
                get the gorilla hairs you go to Cazic and kill the gorillas in 
                the Tae yard. They drop 1 piece of hair each time. For the mermaid's 
                hair you need to go to Kedge. She is level 40+, but not too hard. 
                To get to her room, from the entrance of Kedge, you go straight 
                out, swim down the big hole to the next floor down, then go straight 
                out again. There will be a small room with a hole going up and 
                a hole going down. The hole going up is the one that leads to 
                her room. She is pretty much alone, I think, except there's 1 
                piranha I saw there. You can easily pull her solo though with 
                a simple arrow, snare, or whatever. She drops the piece of hair 
                every time you kill her. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Go 
                back to Freeport to the hair tonic seller. Hand him the 3 pieces 
                of hair and the toupee, it should take up all 4 of his slots. 
                He will then give you the fixed toupee. Bring it back to Ak'Anon 
                and you get the Faerie princess' wing. Bring back the wing to 
                the princess and you get the Faerie gold dust. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now, 
                take the Faerie dust, the Treant heart, a Trueshot Longbow, and 
                3000 gp to the enchanter guildmaster in Felwithe, Kinool Goldsinger. 
                Go through the dialog with him if you want, he basically just 
                tells you the 4 things you need. Hand the items in and he gives 
                you the Rain Caller. </font></p>
