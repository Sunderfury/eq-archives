              recently entered my 22nd season as a wood-elf Ranger and earned 
              the right to learn new spells from my guildmaster. During my life, 
              I have come to appreciate and rely on certain spells, while others 
              I wish I not wasted the gold on. So, in order to pass on a bit of 
              my experiences, I give to you my list of best and worst Ranger spells. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Best: <br>
              <br>
              1&#41; Snare - This spell has so many uses, it&#39;s hard to list 
              them all. It&#39;s saved me countless hours of tracking down and 
              killing my prey when he runs, which also stops him from bringing 
              back a whole squad of his higher level brethren. Finally, should 
              the fight turn against me and my prey is snared, I have a good chance 
              of running. I snare at the beginning of each battle and toward the 
              end. I also use it to lure magic beasts since I can get out of their 
              casting range faster. An absolutely invaluable spell that works 
              on beasts that are higher level than me. <br>
              <br>
              2&#41; Healing line of spells - reduces your down time in between 
              battles and is a welcome addition to your party members. <br>
              <br>
              3&#41; Skin line of spells - raises AC and HP. I ALWAYS have them 
              on. <br>
              <br>
              4&#41; Thistlecoat - raises AC. Always have it on. <br>
              <br>
              5&#41; Camouflage - A great spell for getting through those nasty 
              areas and/or retrieving your corpse. Downsides are that it can go 
              at any time, and certain NPCs can see through it as well as the 
              undead. I also cast it after I&#39;ve died and am in my birthday 
              suit and quite defenseless. <br>
              <br>
              6&#41; Fire line of spells &#40;Flame Lick, Burst of Fire, Ignite&#41; 
              - Good for luring because of their excellent range. I&#39;m beginning 
              to appreciate Ignite for its excellent damage. <br>
              <br>
              7&#41; Feet like Cat - Raises agility and thus AC. Always have it 
              on. Even my party members request it. <br>
              <br>
              Worst: <br>
              <br>
              1&#41; Lull animal - Never used it. Most animals look upon me amiably 
              now anyway. <br>
              <br>
              2&#41; Harmony - No one can quite figure this spell out. <br>
              <br>
              3&#41; Glimpse - Hardly useful. <br>
              <br>
              4&#41; Root - It would seem that this spell is better than snare, 
              but I&#39;ve found that&#39;s not the case. Beasts still have a 
              lot of mobility after they&#39;ve been rooted. Snare reduces their 
              mobility by much more. <br>
              <br>
              5&#41; Bind sight - More of a play thing than a useful spell so 
              far. It has a limited range and appears to give you false images 
              sometimes. For instance, I had bound my sight to someone who appeared 
              to fall into the lava! This turned out not to be the case, but it 
              gave me quite a scare. <br>
              <br>
              All other spells I memorize on some occasions, so they are worth 
              your gold. <br>
              <br>
