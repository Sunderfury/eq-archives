              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                clearing camp and removing all traces of occupation I don my pack, 
                string my bow and fade back into the brush just off the trail. 
                This had been a fine camp with a lovely display of wisps in the 
                night. Must remember this spot. While foraging for some berries 
                I hear a shout in the distance. I settle and listen to the forest... 
                waiting for it to tell me what the commotion is about. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                first sign is an alder’s leaves, moving ever so slightly against 
                the wind, then the fall of a pebble from an outcrop. I ready my 
                bow and loosen my weapons in their scabbards. Over the rise comes 
                running a dark skinned maiden looking over her shoulder behind 
                her. I can't see him yet but the ground is starting to vibrate 
                with each footstep so I know he will be coming around the hill 
                in the distance soon. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                the maiden runs past me on the path I reach out and pull her into 
                the camouflage of the brush. She turns on me with a swift stab 
                of the dagger, which I barely dodge as I back up to show her I 
                mean no harm. "M'Lady, We must not waste any time, your friend 
                will soon clear the rise and then we will both be in trouble. 
                May I assist you?" I say while I bow quickly. With her breath 
                coming quickly, I did jump out of nowhere, she seems to size me 
                up and find me acceptable. "I would kindly accept your assistance 
                kind sir. But.." "I know you have an admirer following you." I 
                chuckle and then hurriedly begin casting around for the items 
                and upon finding them I camouflage us both to the best of my abilities. 
                " Just stay completely still and do not attack what ever you do." 
                About that time the ground shakes and several trees loose leaves 
                and all the dead limbs of the previous winter. Then I can see 
                him. I wonder about my decision to help this obviously Noble Lady.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                I had no idea a Hill Giant could reach the heights of the one 
                walking towards us. I pull us back from the path a way farther 
                and just in time as the giant almost steps on our previous blind. 
                Minutes seemed much longer as we wait for the Giant to wander 
                down the slope and we loose him in the tree. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"M'Lady, 
                methinks thou should choose thine admirers more carefully in the 
                future." I jest to loosen up the tenseness hanging in the air 
                and to calm my nerves. "Now introductions seem to be in order. 
                I am Gyde of the Rangers of Surefall. At your service." Now I 
                let loose with a flourished bow hoping not to make a fool of myself. 
                "I thank you for your timely assistance, Noble Ranger. I was close 
                to collapse. It is a long run from King Xorbs Gourge. My name 
                is Titian. Could I perhaps join you on your way to the Northern 
                Plains of Karana?" </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">While 
                the Northplain was not my original destination I suddenly felt 
                a need to visit a druid kinsman at the Ring in Northplain. "I 
                would consider it an honor to accompany you." I see a smile on 
                the Lady's face as I move to pickup the packs that were dropped 
                when the Giant walked by. I have been on the plains for a while 
                so it wouldn't hurt to have some company on the trail, even if 
                it were not going to my final destination. I think my Stepmother 
                would call that rationalizing. She liked using large educated 
                words around me. She was always trying to push me to follow the 
                rest of the family into the Druids Circle. She often used Saban, 
                my stepbrother, as an example. I pointed out to her our situations 
                were different, which usually headed off any further comments.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                pull my thoughts back to the beautiful lady as we walk down to 
                the trail. She stands taller than I do by a handspan or more, 
                with dark skin and black flowing hair. She wears a robe of shear 
                silk, which would get me into serious trouble if I were to pay 
                any closer attention. At a certain point in the trail I see the 
                game trail that leads off into the woods towards the bridge. While 
                it is not shorter there is less likely a chance of meeting up 
                with the recently departed Giant on this tree strewn path that 
                on the larger well traveled path. While walking we talk of our 
                recent travels and I learn of her homeland of Erud where she is 
                travelling. I had heard of it from my guildmaster in Surefall 
                before but had never met anyone from there before since I loved 
                life on the plain and was rarely seen inside of the walls of Qeynos. 
                It had been long since my last trip to any inhabited place so 
                I found the conversation with Titian stimulating. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Rounding 
                a hill we come upon a pride of lions that are on the hunt. I quickly 
                camouflage the lady and head her in the direction of the bridge. 
                About that time the Matriarch of the pride sees me and heads my 
                direction. I strike a few blows, half heartedly to be sure. I 
                would hate to have to harm this fine lion but I must delay him 
                while the lady makes her escape. When I decide that she has enough 
                of a head start I turn and with a leap jump over the head of a 
                gorge hound that was coming up behind me hoping to suprise me. 
                Now I was in for a run.. I still have a good run to the bridge 
                where the animals will not follow for there is too much traffic 
                and they are generally afraid... unless extremely agitated. I 
                feel the lions claws strike my back almost knocking me to the 
                ground. Then I hear the hound making lunges at my legs, which 
                inspires me to run just a little faster, but I am reaching the 
                limit of my endurance and soon will fall. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">About 
                to the bridge, I had given up hope of reaching it and decided 
                to turn and give a good account of myself when M'Lady Titian appears 
                out of camouflage and casts heal on me. With this little extra 
                we make the run to the bridge and our pursuers fade back into 
                the forest thwarted. "Now I am indebted to you M'Lady" I say with 
                a smile. "Nay Noble Ranger. For you were willing to give your 
                life that I may survive, I am in your debt." Titian smiles as 
                she tends my wounds. We sit and talk while we are resting occasionally 
                laughing about our experiences around Norrath. While we wait friends 
                that are going to Erud also arrive inviting her to join them on 
                their trip. Titian looks my way sadly, "M'Lord I hesitate to leave 
                you. You have helped me so much this day." I stand and bow kissing 
                the gloved hand of the Noble Lady Titian, "It truly was an honor 
                to accompany you and should you ever come this way again I will 
                be here to guide and protect you, M'Lady." Soon after the departure 
                of Titian and her friends I find myself moving .. walking up the 
                trail.. to a spot I know of that has a beautiful display of wisps 
                in the night... </font></p>
