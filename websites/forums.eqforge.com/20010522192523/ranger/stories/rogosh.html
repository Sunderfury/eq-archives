              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
                Last week I got together a full group and headed across the Plains 
                of Karana to the Lair of Splitpaw. My group consisted of myself 
                (a Half-Elf Ranger), an Erudite Wizard, a Half-Elf Bard, a human 
                Bard, and a half-elf warrior. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We 
                went straight down to where Shaman Lenrel spawns and promptly 
                offed her and entourage, but ending up with only a Snakeskin Mask 
                to show for our efforts. After healing up with the bards singing 
                the Hymn of Restoration, I noticed that the evil Gnoll Necromancer 
                Granex Drah was on the tracking screen. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We 
                then proceeded to take care of Drah and his pet along with the 
                mother of all Gelatinous Cubes, which was much higher level than 
                a normal cube and decided to show up during our battle with Drah. 
                To make a long story short, we alternated between killing Lenrel 
                and Granex Drah whenever the spawned but that all ended when the 
                High Shaman Grisok spawned instead of Lenrel. We foolishly believed 
                that it would be the same battle, just a different name... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Maybe 
                it would've been but Grisok carries a Splitpaw Captain in his 
                entourage. For those of you who don't know those are TOUGH! In 
                mid-battle our Wiz decided to do what he could and nuked the captain. 
                Well that got a pissed-off splitpaw captain charging after him, 
                and since he is a wiz, I ran after him taunting the captain, figuring 
                the warrior and bards could handle Grisok and a few shamen and 
                nobles until we finished off the captain. While I am still chasing 
                the Captain, I notice the message that a group member has died 
                flash across the screen immidiately followed by the warrior and 
                one bard running by us with a few nobles and Grisok on their tail 
                and leap into the water.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                The wizard and myself are still battling the captain and Grisok 
                and his goons come after, so into the lake we go as well. Miraculously, 
                not a single gnoll follows us and we simply swim over to a ledge 
                and heal up. I suppose the rumor about Splitpaw Gnolls not being 
                able to swim is true and it is very valuable as we proceded to 
                whomp the captain and his buddies just swimming away whenever 
                we were near death. Happily I haven't died in Paw since discovering 
                the water trick. And now have a few Snakeskin Items and Gnoll 
                heads in my inventory.</font> </p>

                note: To all you young Rangers out there, this is an especially 
                important lesson. The Gnolls of Splitpaw DO NOT swim... well, 
                I did see one flailing helplessly one day trying to get OUT of 
                the water, so I promptly ended his misery.)</font></p>
