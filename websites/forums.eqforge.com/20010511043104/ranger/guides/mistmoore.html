              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Once 
                you have attained ‘adulthood’ in EverQuest which means you are 
                now level 20 it is time to start looking for new hunting grounds. 
                The places you visited in your teens like Crushbone and Blackburrow 
                have become too easy for you. If you are based in Faydwer, Mistmoore 
                is an interesting place to visit.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">One 
                thing has to be said up front: Mistmoore is evil. And I’m not 
                just talking about the vampires. Trains are a part of life in 
                Mistmoore and some of the most heinous trains I have ever seen 
                in EverQuest were in Mistmoore. It is not unusual for a massive 
                train to rage through the zone emptying it out and killing many 
                hapless players. The Mistmoore zone is usually littered with bodies. 
                If you arrive at the Mistmoore zone from Lesser Faydark and notice 
                a large group of players milling about (some of them undoubtedly 
                naked) chances are there is a welcoming committee at the other 
                end of the zone you’d rather not encounter. If you can, always 
                camo before entering Mistmoore, you never know what is waiting 
                for you. </font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">However 
                Mistmoore is an outdoors zone so it’s perfect for Rangers. Camouflage 
                is a life safer there and I seriously recommend a druid or shaman 
                in your party because sow can mean the difference between life 
                and death when escaping from a train. Once you get to know the 
                place and are comfortable there, you can make good experience 
                and carry home armfuls of loot. I hunted in Mistmoore off and 
                on between my 22<sup>nd</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> level and made 
                several hundred platinum from Mistmoore trips alone.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Mistmoore 
                is also pretty small, at least the area for levels 20-30 is. The 
                initial lake area for levels 20-27 can support about 3 full groups. 
                Any more and it gets crowded and dangerous. The graveyard area 
                can support 1 maybe 2 groups, the secret room and tower another 
                group and the ancille valley and cave another 2 groups. This guide 
                will not cover the castle since I have never set foot in it. It 
                houses monsters of terrifying capabilities and due to the nature 
                of the zone it is extremely dangerous to even get near it. Raiding 
                parties of level 40+ players have been wiped out there due to 
                pathing problems, things attacking through walls and the tendency 
                of the zone to generate trains of truly epic proportions. If you 
                enter the zone and see there is a group of level 35+ people in 
                there chances are it is going to be a dangerous time.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">To 
                get to Mistmoore, enter the forest of Lesser Faydark. This place 
                used to be quiet and serene but nowadays it is overrun by shadowed 
                men and dangerous brownies. So camo up and head to the south-west 
                corner of the zone. The Mistmoore entrance is just past the Nybright 
                camp by some ruins. Make sure you camo yourself and enter the 
                zone. If there is a group of dark elves standing around zone back 
                immediately. Especially if they have pets or if there are gargoyles. 
                Things like ‘thought corruptors’, ‘will sappers’ and ‘ancille 
                cooks’ will make mincemeat out of unsuspecting level 22 rangers 
                wandering into Mistmoore unprepared. Most monsters in the zone 
                cannot see through camouflage however so you should be ok. What 
                I used to do is observe by the zone, just stand there during a 
                train and watch the hordes pour forth. Do this at your own risk 
                though, some monsters see through camo and you might not even 
                make the ten steps it takes to get back to the zone!</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                are also frequent ‘ghosts’ of monsters that you will see walk 
                away from the zone and disappear into a wall. Or there could be 
                pets from caster monsters standing in a corner. Always be careful 
                and under NO circumstances attack these. The actual monster or 
                pet’s owner could be deep in the zone and attacking it could cause 
                a massive death-spreading train. You’ll be happily hacking away 
                at the pet when shouts of terror start filling the zone and a 
                tidal wave of half-dead players followed by an army of dark elves 
                washes you away into oblivion. Trust me I have seen it happen 
                more than once.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes 
                people decide to make a stand at the zone and big chaotic battles 
                ensue. If you are brave and foolish you can participate, but usually 
                zoning out is the best thing to do. Being stunned repeatedly by 
                a gang of familiars and dying two steps from the zone is frustrating.</font></p>

                you zone in head down the ramp into the lake area. There are two 
                exits to this area, the ramp back to the zone and the gorge leading 
                to the graveyard, ancille valley and castle. If you are below 
                level 26 you really want to stay away from the graveyard and anything 
                beyond it. At the bottom of the ramp you will find the lake with 
                a circular area around it. To your immediate right there will 
                be a tower on a large rocky outcropping. At the base of the tower 
                two gargoyles appear. These are highly sought after for the eyes 
                they sometimes drop. These eyes sell for up to 9 platinum at vendors. 
                Going home after an evening in Mistmoore with 4 Gargoyle eyes 
                in your pack is a good thing.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">To 
                your left the area circles around the lake and meets back up at 
                the tower base and ramp up to the zone. Past the tower to the 
                right is the entrance to the gorge leading to the graveyard. There 
                are three prime spots for groups to camp and pull to:</font></p>

                <p align="JUSTIFY">
                <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">At 
                  the other side of the tower base facing the gorge entrance. 
                  This is a very good spot for pulling from the gorge itself plus 
                  there are about 5 spawn spots close by. However this is the 
                  most dangerous location since trains usually come from the gorge 
                  and go right by this spot. If whoever is pulling the train takes 
                  the shortcut up the tower base (there is a lone familiar spawn 
                  spot there), the train will thunder right through your camp 
                  spot, most probably annihilating your group.</font></li>

                  the top of the lake shore, in the corner directly left of the 
                  bottom of the ramp. Probably the safest spot in the lake area 
                  but not ideal since pulling from the gorge means pulling past 
                  the people camped at the tree a bit further down towards the 
                  gorge entrance. Confusion will happen here and your pull might 
                  join their fight or attack their meditating people leading to 
                  kill-stealing arguments and death.</font></li>

                  when you have a runner they head down towards the open area 
                  in front of the gorge which is prime train territory.</font></li>

              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Little 
                note: as you might have gathered by now, life in Mistmoore is 
                ruled by trains. Everything you do has to be done with possible 
                trains in mind. More about trains and how to live with them later.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">So 
                what do you fight in the lake area you might wonder? Familiars. 
                In vampire folklore, familiars are people who aspire to be vampires. 
                They have to serve vampires and prove their worth before they 
                are bitten so they can become vampires themselves. Once a vampire 
                has claimed a familiar for itself, this familiar is then marked 
                with a glyph and becomes a glyphed familiar. Killing a glyphed 
                familiar means a very annoyed vampire owner. In Mistmoore however, 
                glyphed familiars are simply tougher than the regular ones.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Familiars 
                come in different levels. Some of them are casters, male or female 
                ones (‘bikini-babes’ in Mistmoore slang) can be dangerous. When 
                you see your puller’s health drop rapidly he or she probably pulled 
                a caster. (or started a train in which case you’ll be legging 
                it to the zone)</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>

                area: pulling and living with trains</font></u></font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                a ranger it is likely you will be the puller and group leader. 
                Two things are essential for survival in Mistmoore: a good puller 
                and train awareness. Things will spawn around your camp spot. 
                Be prepared for that. Have someone in your group create a hotkey 
                that will warn you, something like &quot;Faenor! Come back now 
                we have enemies beating on us!&quot;. Nothing is worse to come 
                back with a pull and seeing your group already in battle.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Always 
                camo when pulling. Especially when pulling from the gorge area 
                which you will be especially when it is crowded since quite a 
                few familiars appear in there. Two reasons camo is important. 
                First of all - I have survived quite a few trains this way - I 
                would be walking down the gorge, minding my own business when 
                all of a sudden a large group of hideously red monsters would 
                come running past me. I would yell at my group to run to the zone 
                NOW and pray camo would hold. Second, there is the famous runner. 
                A patrolling monster (usually an initiate) will stroll down the 
                gorge. When it sees a player or gets turned aggressive in any 
                other way it will turn around and run back. All the way back to 
                the dark and evil depths of Mistmoore. When it finds ancilles 
                in the valley these plate-clad killing machines will come running 
                out destroying everything in their path. And if the ancille valley 
                is empty…it will run into the castle. I don’t have to explain 
                what comes next then.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">When 
                camouflaged however this runner will not notice you. It will also 
                allow you to detect the runner and warn the zone that evil is 
                about to come in large numbers.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes, 
                especially at off-peak hours or just after a big train has cleared 
                out the zone, the gorge will be fully spawned. This means pulling 
                becomes tricky. Beware of the initiate who spawns on top of the 
                ledge at the left side of the gorge. When this one gets pulled 
                it will run back down the ledge and cause most of the others to 
                go aggressive. This will mean another train. Oh joy. However this 
                is a great time to show off your harmony spell and pull singles 
                from a fully spawned gorge. Never fails to impress your group. 
                Just be careful is all I can say. Better to over-harmonise than 
                to risk pulling more than you can handle. Harmony takes time to 
                cast make sure you explain that to your group so they don’t get 
                impatient and do anything stupid. I have seen the group cleric 
                wander into the gorge while I was in mid-harmony to see what was 
                going on only to cause death and destruction.</font></p>

                who is likely to be in the graveyard or ancille valley or if they’re

                people who can camo or cast invisibility have designated people 
                (warriors and others who cannot camo themselves) they cast on

                kill it. Under no circumstance attack things from a train that 
                are on their way back. Most likely the entire train will return

                the tomb in the far corner of the graveyard area is a secret wall

                has another secret wall. Through there you will enter what is 
                known as the secret room. It looks like a prison of some sorts 
                with three cells holding monsters. There are four doors in this 
                room, the door directly opposite the entrance will open the other 
                three as well. Now this place is a bit peculiar. The monsters 
                will not leave their rooms when attacked. However if they are 
                casters they will cast of course even through the door. This can 
                be confusing. Also the doors will close automatically after a 
                short while so it is possible to get trapped in a cell.</font></p>

                the secret room can be easy or hard depending on what kind of 
                monsters are in the cells at the time. If they are melee types 
                like ushers or sappers, you will be fine since you can fight one 
                at a time. If there are casters it gets harder since they will 
                start casting away as soon as the fighting starts. Sometimes they 
                even cast on you when you are simply there. I have wandered into 
                the secret room under camo only to be blasted for many hit points, 
                causing me to turn around and run back out. From that moment on 
                the monster will stay aggressive to you so when you get back in 
                it’s range it will cast on you again.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Since 
                you have to fight inside the little cells, you need at least one 
                person to operate the door. Your cleric or wizard preferably since 
                they have no business being in the little cells at melee range 
                anyway.</font></p>

                are three exits to the secret room. One back to the graveyard, 
                one down some stairs to the basement of the tomb and one up some 
                stairs into the tower. If you take this exit you will end up and 
                a T junction. Head left and you will end up inside the castle. 
                Head right and you will go into the tower overlooking the lake 
                area. People use this as a shortcut sometimes to get out of the 
                graveyard or secret room in times of trouble. Up the stairs, and 
                jump off the little bridge leading to the tower down to the base 
                of the ramp leading up to the zone. Only do this when you have 
                enough HP to survive the fall. I have never done this so do not 
                know how many HP the fall takes. There are also hard-hitting monsters 
                up in the tower that will happily send you to the afterlife so 
                be careful. Rumour has it that Lord Mayong Mistmoore himself spawns 
                in the tower sometimes. During all the time I have spent in Mistmoore 
                I have never seen him so I don’t know if this is true or not.</font></p>

              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                last area before the actual castle is known as the ‘ancille valley’. 
                It is a large open area with a ramp leading up to the castle entrance 
                on the left hand side. It extends quite far back up to a platform 
                and a cave. The entire area is filled with ancilles. Ancilles 
                are vampire protectors and servants. They do quite a good job 
                since a fully spawned ancille valley in combination with a careless 
                player or a runner will cause a lethal train. The melee-type ancilles 
                are dressed in plate mail and hit pretty hard. Since they are 
                melee however they shouldn’t pose that much of a problem. The 
                casters however can be dangerous. Wraithish and Vampirish ancilles 
                can do some serious damage so be careful.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                area is actually quite safe if you have a group strong enough 
                to handle the ancilles (a full and well balanced group of lvl30ish 
                people can do it) however taking a fully spawned valley can be 
                tricky. A skilled ranger with harmony can do the pulling and a 
                good enchanter or bard with crowd control skills in the group 
                is useful when a pull gets more than the group can handle. Clear 
                out the area in front of the graveyard, fight the initial pulls 
                there. The ranger goes down the tunnel and inches forward until 
                the first ancilles are visible. Cast harmony on the closest one 
                and enter a bit further. Keep casting harmony on the ones you 
                can see. Then cross your fingers and pull the closest one. Hopefully 
                the careful harmonising worked and you get one or two ancilles. 
                Return to the group, proceed to slaughter the pulls and repeat. 
                Once the initial area is clear the group can move in and start 
                clearing the area all the way to the back. There are some gargoyles 
                in the back as well plus a dark elf called Enynti that sometimes 
                drops the rune of fortune. Once cleared the ancilles should appear 
                in little groups staggered over time allowing the group to fight 
                them a few at a time. Holding the ancille valley for some time 
                means great loot and exp. plus a much more safe Mistmoore for 
                the rest of the people in the zone. You will be able to intercept 
                runners from the gorge and graveyard that normally pull the ancilles 
                or disappear into the castle. I remember being in the ancille 
                valley for hours holding it safely and people shouting about what 
                happened to the trains :). However if you miss a runner and see 
                it sprint up the ramp into the castle, do not hesitate. Run for 
                the zone immediately and warn people that death will follow soon. 
                Also if a higher level group comes by and decides to try the castle, 
                it might be wise to leave. Having a castle train descend upon 
                you while you are in battle with ancilles will most probably kill 
                you.</font></p>

                A bard or enchanter and a good healer are absolutely necessary 
                since the initial pulls will be messy and crowded. Once you have 
                a foothold and the puller knows what he or she is doing you will 
                be allright. I have been in the kitchen controlling the spawns 
                in the nearby corridor and servant’s quarters where the maid and 
                butler spawn with a full group doing pretty well. </font></p>

                is a great zone, the risks are high but the rewards can be good 
                indeed. When the zone is overcrowded and people start taking risks 
                to get kills or when there is a group having trouble in the ancille 
                valley or castle it can be very dangerous. Trains are frequent 
                and deadly and can shut down the zone for 10-20 minutes at a time. 
                On a good day you can spend a lot of time in there and make some 
                great experience and loot. Just be careful, keep an eye out for 
                trains and hone your pulling skills until people will beg you 
                to stay and pull when you announce you have to leave…</font></p>
