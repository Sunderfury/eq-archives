              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ryndix 
                wiped Vengeance, his axe, and Retribution, his blade, clean. Glancing 
                at the surrounding caves in Runnyeye, he looked for tracks of 
                beasts that might disturb Alluro's meditation, because Tunare 
                knew he'd need the stout druids healing before he bled to death. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Alluro 
                stood and looked over his companions wounds. Clucking his tongue, 
                he remarked how Ryndix shouldn't be so reckless in the heat of 
                battle. Ryndix shrugged off the comment and closed his eyes for 
                the healing to begin. Alluro raised his hands and prayed for Tunare 
                to guide her healing graces through him. Blue lights surrounded 
                Alluro's hands as he laid them on Ryn's wounds. Immediately the 
                light began to bind his wounds, and the sounds of bones popping 
                into place echoed throughout the caverns. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"My 
                legs no longer feel as boisterous as they once were friend," remarked 
                Ryndix. Alluro sighed, he didn't know how often a day he had to 
                do this for his party members, or for others who would promise 
                money for the enchantment, or for others who just begged for it 
                until he cast it upon them just to shut them up. "We'll have to 
                go outside for this, I need the fresh air and the sky for the 
                Spirit of the Wolf to enter you," Alluro said. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">They 
                made their way up through the canverns, passing by Goblins who 
                were too afraid to touch them for their reputation as great Goblin 
                Slayers. One brave goblin with a rusty weapon in hand stood in 
                front of Ryndix and growled. Ryn scoffed at the goblins foolishness, 
                and drew Vengeance and Retribution. He closed his eyes and mumbled 
                the spidery words of magic as flames leapt from his hands to encase 
                the goblin. Alluro mumbled something about meeting outside when 
                Ryn was finished, and proceeded out of the caverns. The goblin 
                shrieked and ran toward Ryndix, weapon flailing wildly. Ryn easily 
                parried and dodged the weak rain of steel that was assualting 
                him. He swung and reversed, swung again and reversed, each swing 
                bringing more pain for the goblin and bringing more terror to 
                the eyes of his evil comrades watching him. With one mighty kick, 
                Ryndix launched the goblin across the cavern where it hit the 
                wall and collapsed in a lifeless heap. Ryn sauntered over and 
                picked through the things money pouch for spare change, then took 
                its weapon and destroyed it, so that other goblins wouldn't be 
                able to use against him or his friends again. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ryn's 
                eyes widened and he placed his ear to the ground. He could feel 
                a vibration as if many feet were running in his direction. Just 
                then someone from deeper in the cavern shouted, 'TRAIN." Ryn cursed 
                and healed his scratches for the onslaught that was approaching. 
                From around the corner he saw 3 harried, young adventurers running 
                for their lives from 2 dazed goblin guards. Ryndix pulled his 
                bow and shot as fast as he could, trying to make the guards come 
                his way. The arrows sailed through the cavern and took one guard 
                in the neck and it went down. It had obviously been hurt very 
                badly already to die so quickly. Ryn then mumbled the words of 
                magic again and set a snare around the other guard. The adventurers 
                thanked him as they ran past him. He made a show of setting himself 
                in front of the guard and waiting for it to arrive, so that the 
                young adventurers would think him brave. As soon as the young 
                ones rounded the corner to the surface, he turned and began to 
                run, knowing he could never take a dazed guard alone... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly 
                his feet became rooted to the ground. He didn't see the shaman 
                coming up slowly behind the guard, and he cursed his poor observation 
                of the situation. He turned ready to face his oppenents, but he 
                knew he would never survive... alone. Mentally he called out for 
                Alluro to come and help him escape death yet again. Alluro responded 
                that he'd be there as fast as possible. Then the fight began. 
                The guard came at him with a slow, but powerful vengeance, constantly 
                making large wounds. The shaman sat back and casted at his will. 
                Spells of ice and poison and plague assualted Ryndix. He parried 
                and swung as best as he could, but it was obvious that the battle 
                would be lost soon if Alluro failed to show. He felt the wounds 
                taking their toll, and he began to slump slightly. His blows were 
                sluggish and un-accurate. The guard raised his fist for a final 
                mashing of his skull as time seemed to slow down. The guard laughed 
                maniacally as his fist crept toward Ryn's head, the shaman still 
                uttering words of pain and suffering. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Then 
                a light as the guards fist exploded from his hand and hit the 
                shaman in the head, disturbing his casting. Ryn looked behind 
                him to see a wolf casting another spell to bring the goblins pain 
                just before he collapsed in a heap. Alluro made flame and swarms 
                surround the guard over and over, and when the guard turned tail 
                to run, so did the shaman. But Alluro would have none of that, 
                vines and roots came up from the cavern ground to grasp the guard. 
                Alluro ran up and began to bite the guard with his gnashing teeth. 
                The guard fell, but the shaman got away. Alluro prayed to Tunare 
                again and laid his hands on Ryndix who awoke with a start, and 
                together they limped to the surface.<br>
