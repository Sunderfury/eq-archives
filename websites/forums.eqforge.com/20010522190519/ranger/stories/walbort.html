              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Walbort's 
                face was grim as he conjured a night's supply of bread and water, 
                packing them into his belt pouch as they appeared. How had he 
                gotten himself into this? After his first- and last, he'd sworn 
                at the time- experience in Befallen, complete with so many deaths 
                that Brell Sirilis himself had scolded him before restoring his 
                life the sixth and final time before his hasty departure, he had 
                fully expected never again to set foot inside its unholy walls. 
                And yet when Royal, the friend of his youth, had come to him with 
                the request for assistance in his quest for a mighty blade found 
                only there in the possession of a demonic warrior, he had allowed 
                himself to believe for a moment that it wouldn't be so bad this 
                time. After all, Royal, who he had once stood watch over as he 
                struggled to kill gnome skeletons, now far outmatched him both 
                in skill and power. His full suit of bronze plate armor gleamed 
                in the light cast by his shiny brass shield- surely he'd be safe 
                with someone like that. Besides, Rolin Anduril would be coming 
                along too- he of the magical tomahawk, lightning-fast whip, and 
                swift kick to a monster's derriere. With bodyguards like them, 
                he could count on being safe no matter how deep they descended 
                into Befallen's bowels, so he agreed to go. But now that the time 
                had arrived, his bravado had evaporated, replaced only by the 
                desperate need to retain control of his bladder in the face of 
                suffocating panic. A shout came from the nearby gates of Freeport: 
                "Casting Spirit of the Wolf for donations!" Just the thing! He 
                ran to the gates and received the prized enchantment, although 
                the druid didn't seem to appreciate his reference to it afterwards 
                as "Spirit of the Chicken". Lupine spirit swelling within, the 
                ground began to fly past his feet at he climbed the nearby foothills 
                for the run to Befallen. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It 
                was dusk, so as he approached, an unnatural green light shone 
                from the entrance. Swallowing hard, he thumbed through his spellbook 
                and reviewed the spells he was planning to use- an assortment 
                of spells designed to allow him to make a token stand while offering 
                as many options as possible for rapid retreat. Healing, to mend 
                the multiplicity of wounds he expected to receive. Symbol of Transal, 
                for that little extra endurance that might keep Rolin and Royal 
                alive long alive to allow him to run away in unreasoning hysteria. 
                Expulse Undead, in case retreat somehow became impossible. Spook 
                the Dead struck him as somewhat hypocritical, since they couldn't 
                POSSIBLY be as afraid of him as he was of them. Invisibility to 
                Undead, AKA "Out of Sight, Out Of Mind". Root, AKA "Simon Says 
                Stop!". Gate, AKA "I meant to Root, I swear! Did you guys die?". 
                And of course, Divine Aura- "What, they're hitting you? Funny, 
                I'm not getting hurt..." So deep was his reverie that he ran right 
                past Royal, who sat waiting for him inside the entrance. He might 
                have betrayed his unease when Royal tapped him on the shoulder 
                as he ran by, causing him to drop his hammer in fright and let 
                out a high-pitched scream. Rolin and Royal looked on bemusedly 
                as he gathered up his weapon again. They went inside a little 
                deeper, then began to cast their incantations of protection on 
                each other. Walbort was a little short in the cash department, 
                so he made the somewhat miserly suggestion that they delay casting 
                Symbol until further inside to avoid depleting his supply of Cat's 
                Eye Agates, the reagent needed for the spell. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Desperate 
                to delay further progress, he commenced a long charade of elaborate 
                meditation, reporting intermittently that his progress had been 
                slowed by the oppressive evil of the building. When they would 
                no longer accept his protestations of unpreparedness, he rose 
                to his feet and followed them to the first locked door, the hollow 
                clang from his knocking, banded-armored knees echoing within the 
                cavernous main hall. They picked way through the collapsed rubble 
                to the second floor, then unlocked and opened the door to the 
                third and final level. Rolin sprang through the door, bow at the 
                ready, but the room was strangely empty. Walbort's face recovered 
                a bit of the color it had lost as they had descended this far. 
                A full group of hardy adventurers stood nearby, keeping watch 
                for the appearance of further unholy creatures- they must be the 
                ones who had secured this area. The three of them descended the 
                stairs and turned right. Royal began to run his arm along the 
                wall, feeling for the proper spot. Suddenly, his arm appeared 
                to be halfway swallowed up by the wall, and Walbort let out an 
                involuntary yelp as he prepared to flee. Royal only grinned fiercely 
                at him, then stepped further into the wall and disappeared. Suddenly 
                Walbort felt his surroundings blur around him- not another one 
                of those migraines again... <fade to real life> </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&lt;Fade 
                to real life&gt;<br>
                <br>
                Wife: Have you seen this new phone bill? What is this line charge 
                for? Did you ask for this zero-plus dialing thing? Can you watch 
                the baby a minute while I get the soap for her bath? Have you 
                looked at her new hairbow? </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Husband: 
                Uhhhhh.... <glancing nervously at screen> &lt;glancing nervously 
                at the screen&gt; Just a minute.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&lt;Wife 
                storms off with baby, fade back to other world&gt;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                shook his head and the cobwebs miraculously cleared. His eyes 
                grew wide as he realized he was alone in the hallway! Now where 
                had Royal stepped through? Here? <whack> Ouch...guess not. Maybe 
                it was... <clang> Nope, not there either. Sighing, he leaned against 
                the wall to ponder his hopeless situation- then tumbled backwards 
                through the illusory section and landed in a heap inside the shadow 
                knight's lair. Royal and Rolin just shook their heads and marched 
                on. Another group was keeping this area free of the numerous undead 
                which rose from Innoruuk's lair to haunt it, and one of their 
                number inquired as to Royal's intentions. Upon hearing that he 
                intended to slay the shadow knight in order to gain possession 
                of his fearsome blade, the mysterious benefactor warned that should 
                the shadow knight detect a presence within the room containing 
                his portal of entry from the nether realms, he may choose not 
                to show himself. Hearing this, they all retreated to the mouth 
                of the room and began to watch and wait, Rolin periodically putting 
                his ear to the ground to listen for signs of distant monster activity. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Before 
                long, the walls were starting to close in on Walbort. He sat crosslegged 
                on the ground with his arms wrapped tightly around himself, rocking 
                back and forth and repeating "Brell preserve me...Brell preserve 
                me..." under his breath until Rolin flicked a grub at him in annoyance. 
                As he picked the slimy creature out of his beard - curse that 
                ranger aim! - he failed to notice both that his enchantment of 
                invisibility had worn off and the huge skeleton bearing down on 
                him from behind as a result. Faster than any eye could follow, 
                Rolin's bow was in his hands, sending an arrow singing past the 
                surpsied cleric's ear, knifing through the unliving servant of 
                death. Royal's sword soon swung into action as well, and seeing 
                that the skeleton was now doomed, Walbort felt enough strength 
                return to his rubbery arms to swing his hammer a few times before 
                the inevitable victory. Rolin spat, "Keep your encantation up 
                next time- and clean up this mess!" Royal said nothing, as usual, 
                but his eyes remained kind, as befit his virtuous nature. Cowed, 
                Walbort pulled the meager items of value from the corpse and stuffed 
                them into a backpack, kicking the shattered bones off against 
                a nearby wall. Time passed, and despite a few other conflicts 
                of a startlingly similar origin, the shadow knight had still not 
                made his appearance. Rolin grew restless, continually glancing 
                back the way they'd come and hinting that the wide expanse of 
                the Karanas might suit him better, and soon. Even Royal's wise 
                face grew troubled- could it be that they'd not complete the quest 
                this night? </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly 
                Rolin's features snapped into a mask of intense concentration. 
                "Inside!", he cried, and barrelled into the shadow knight's lair, 
                followed closely by Royal. Peeking around the corner after them, 
                Walbort beheld a creature right out of his most unspeakable nightmares. 
                A spectre of pure evil, the troll's already sinister features 
                were darkened further by the light of his unholy magicks, and 
                this putrid package appeared to be wrapped in a shiny armored 
                shell! His skeleton pet fought by his side, cackling madly, and 
                a tough-looked ghoul joined in as well. Rolin's initial entrance 
                meant that the three of them were exclusively focused on seperating 
                him from his extremities, and despite his catlike agility, their 
                blows were too-often finding their mark. "Heel!", he yelled abruptly. 
                Walbort looked down in alarm- was something about to lay siege 
                to his feet? Rolin lost all patience, desperation fueling his 
                voice, "HEAL MY WOUNDS YOU @^%$#@@%$#@ MIDGET!!!!!" </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At 
                the sight of his comrades now in mortal danger, Walbort's fear 
                suddenly evaporated, replaced only by the determination to preserve 
                their lives at any cost. Raising his hands, he cast a binding 
                incantation on the shadow knight, fixing him in place, then spooked 
                his pet into a rapid retreat. Turning to Rolin, he allowed the 
                mystical energies within him to take the form of healing power, 
                which he turned full-force on the wiry ranger. His wounds quickly 
                began to mend, cuts closing, bones knitting back together again, 
                strength pouring back into strained muscles. "Yes!", Rolin cried 
                as the next wave of healing arrived- it was as if no blow had 
                ever been struck! The shadow knight's green eyes widened a bit 
                as he sensed the tide of battle begin to turn. He growled a command 
                to the ghoul, and it turned to rain blows on the diminutive cleric. 
                "Stand and fight, friends, I am in no danger!", Walbort cried. 
                It was something of a falsehood, since a visual inspection of 
                the ghoul revealed him to be more than a match for the dwarf physically, 
                but the strong banded armor Walbort wore was doing a good job 
                of diminishing the impact of the many blows the ghoul landed on 
                him- he would live long enough to save his friends, of that he 
                was now sure. His attempt to spook it only added to its rage, 
                so he settled into an exchange of blows with the evil beast. The 
                battle raged on, but the healing power he directed at Rolin, still 
                the apparent sole target of both shadow knight and pet, kept him 
                safe and vigorous. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Suddenly, 
                the shadow knight broke free of the binding spell and began to 
                flee as quickly as his wounds allowed. Rolin and Royal uttered 
                shouts of triumph, beating mercilessly at the troll's weaker back 
                armor, until finally the evil warrior screamed a final furious 
                cry and fell, dead. Seeing that the shadow knight had been defeated, 
                Rolin ran back to Walbort's side, and with a few vicious attacks, 
                eliminated the remaining danger. From behind them, Royal bellowed, 
                "It is here! The sword is mine!" They found him clutching the 
                shadow knight's grim sidearm- strangely, he had never drawn the 
                awesome weapon, choosing instead to fight them with a rusty longsword 
                he carried as well. His apparent disain for their abilities had 
                cost him dearly. The nearby adventurers crowded around them, staring 
                at the mighty weapon and voicing their congratulations, which 
                the excited warriors responded to with thanks for their kind assistance. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Walbort 
                stood a short distance away from the mad celebration and quietly 
                enchanted himself back to full health. He caught Royal's eye for 
                a moment, gave him a small wave and a smile, which Royal returned 
                broadly, brandishing the weapon in exultation. Even Rolin cracked 
                a sarcastic grin in his direction- "Keep an eye on that heel, 
                priest." Walbort laughed at his folly, the thrill of shared triumph 
                erasing all traces of embarrassment. "Till we meet again, my friends...", 
                he said, as the tendrils of Gate began to wind around him. It 
                had not been such a bad trip after all... </font></p>
