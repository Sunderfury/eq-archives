                Guide to Cazic-Thule</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">Editors 
                note: Rubicite is no longer dropped in Cazic</font></b></font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;After 
                a ranger has passed the beginning levels and learned his strengths 
                and weaknesses, it is time to go and adventure. One of the best 
                places I have found to gain experience and loot is Cazic-Thule.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cazic 
                is located in the zone of Feerot, which can be accessed from the 
                Rathe Mountains or Innothule Swamp. Cazic is on the South wall, 
                approximately in the middle of the zone. Feerot has a few dangers 
                you should be aware of. Firstly, Ogre Bouncers…. high level (40ish) 
                ogres that walk around the zone. Occasionally, one will chase 
                someone into the entrance to Cazic, causing a bit of a problem. 
                Secondly, there is a spectre cave to the west of Cazic and these 
                will occasionally be trained to the entrance as well.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Cazic 
                is home to a race of lizardmen, and the only place in Norrath 
                to acquire the much sought after Rubicite armor. There are several 
                types of these lizards, varying greatly in difficulty. Cazic lizards 
                are very social and will attack anyone, they also come in groups 
                and will help out any of their kind that are in trouble. Note 
                that your &quot;con&quot; is very misleading in Cazic because 
                the lizards have A LOT of hitpoints, hit VERY hard, and will beat 
                you to death before you can finish them off.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                are MANY trains in Cazic so resting by the zone is not a very 
                wise choice unless you are invisible. Most people choose to rest 
                in the courtyard where they can stay away from any train that 
                is pulled to the entrance. <i>Please note that lizard levels I 
                give are approximate, there is a fairly wide level range for several 
                of the lizards in Cazic.</i></font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="2">COMMON 
                SPAWNS:</font></i></font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Near 
                the zone you will find Broodlings and Guards, which are great 
                for mid-teen levels. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 
                across the zone you will find warders, proselytes, and disciples, 
                these are lower level casters who can heal, will cast offensive 
                spells and are very hard to kill as they heal themselves and any 
                lizards around them. It is effective to use stun spells on these 
                and all other caster classes. My advice is to take out any casters 
                before you engage the melee class, as the casters will keep healing 
                them anyway.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next 
                are the defenders and sentinels. These are melee fighters that 
                hit very hard (up to 60 for the highest levels). I began to solo 
                defenders in the mid-twenties and got beat up pretty badly. My 
                level is now 35 and these are mainly green to me and still attack 
                me on sight.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lizard 
                pages, justicars and judicator are the next casting types of lizards. 
                These hit hard, cast some very powerful direct damage spells and 
                have some impressive healing abilities. Again, these should be 
                dealt with first in a fight. They range from 24-32 or so and will 
                heal other lizards even if they are engaged in another fight.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 
                of the toughest melee fighters in Cazic, listed in ascending order 
                of difficulty, are protectors, fanatics and zealots. I began soloing 
                protectors at level 33 and can just barely take a fanatic at 35 
                (if I am lucky). I have seen zealots hit for up to 74 points of 
                damage and are very hard to bring down (they are about L33-34).</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                are also three alligator pits in the zone that can be pulled from. 
                These gators range from 24-33 or so. They bite VERY hard and have 
                a tendency to swarm one person. Extreme caution should be used 
                when fighting these. They drop no loot, but give very good experience.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="2">UNIQUE 
                SPAWNS:</font></i></font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                are many unique monsters in Cazic that drop sought after items. 
                It is not my intention to make this a spoiler, but I will give 
                you some names and locations. These items are fairly heavily camped 
                and rare drops. You will need a group to get them and be at least 
                L25+ to stand a chance against these mobs.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                the maze occasionally a Clay Golem will spawn. This is very hard 
                to get to because of its spawn location, but if you kill it you 
                will get either a golem potion (which turns you into an elemental 
                for a while) or a lizardskin tribal mask.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                the throne room you will find the Tae Ew Templar and Tae Ew Diviner. 
                These drop Rubicite pieces rarely and lizardscale items commonly. 
                The Stone Golem also spawns in this area. It sometimes carries 
                another piece of Rubicite.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through&#9; 
                he maze you will find a temple with fairly high level lizards. 
                At the top spawns the Tae Ew Archon which also drops Rubicite 
                or a lizardscale piece.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Down 
                in the sewers you will find some alligator pits and the rare Steel 
                Golem. This golem carries another Rubi piece or a rod that will 
                cancel magic. When the golem does not spawn a placeholder Lizard 
                Champion does. This lizard is level 35 and very hard to bring 
                down.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                another part of the sewers you will find the Avatar of Fear room. 
                This room spawns the two toughest (in my opinion) monsters in 
                the zone. The Cazic Cenobyte spawns here. This Lizard drops another 
                Rubi piece. Last but not least the Avatar of Fear spawns in this 
                room. This beast is about level 38-39 and hits for 89 points. 
                It is very resistant to magic and very quick, you will need a 
                powerful group indeed to bring it down. The Avatar drops either 
                the Thulian Bladed Claws or the Rubi Breastplate.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><font size="2">SUMMARY:</font></i></font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;I 
                hope that this guide will help you as you enter Cazic. It is really 
                worthwhile to visit this dungeon as you can gain a lot of experience 
                and loot here (I forgot to mention that many lizards carry fine 
                steel weapons and quite a bit of cash). Make sure that you get 
                bound in Freeport and it is a great idea to get on good terms 
                with some L29+ clerics for resurrections. There are many places 
                in the zone to hunt for experience and loot besides the heavily 
                camped areas. Search one out and you can do very well.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;One 
                final note. ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, snare whatever you are fighting 
                or it will come back with several nasty friends. For those of 
                you with Ebony blades, be very careful. Right now the blade is 
                bugged and you might not be able to re-snare the lizard if it 
                tries to run. This has been the death of many a good Ranger (and 
                group) in Cazic.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;Good 
                hunting and stay safe.</font></p>
