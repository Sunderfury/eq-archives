                from Norrath</font></b> 
              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">'Twas 
                a wonderful day in Kelethin... I felt quite proud in having just 
                finished a set of Patchwork armor for myself. Having only been 
                a part of the Ranger Guild for Three Seasons (though nearing my 
                Fourth), I was still quite inexperienced in the ways of the wood, 
                but this accomplishment gave me renewed confidence in my skills. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                set out from Kelethin late that evening to track more Black wolves. 
                Several young adventurers had approached me about crafting them 
                armor, and I needed the pelts to begin. I set out from the main 
                lift and quickly passed the stone ruins. Crossing through the 
                gully I set out on the track of a wily wolf. As I tracked I took 
                time to forage for food, finding a variety of berries and an occasional 
                rabbit. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Within 
                a short time, I had gathered several pelts, but so lost in my 
                task was I that I had lost track of time and direction (my ability 
                to sense direction under the thick canopy of trees is still quite 
                poor). Darkness had fallen and I was unsure in which direction 
                my beloved city in the trees lay. To make matters worse, I had 
                crossed paths with a growing number of those foul Orcs... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                quickly found a few trees and knelt down to gather my bearings... 
                I picked up the trail of several Orcs, some of them with deeper 
                prints than others. I had a growing feeling of dread that I had 
                wandered close to Crushbone. Keeping close to the cover of trees, 
                I began following a large ridgeline in what I guessed was a southerly 
                direction. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It 
                was then that I crossed paths with a young maiden as she finished 
                off a vile Orc. She, a young Druid whose name escapes me, had 
                become separated from her group and was waiting for them to return 
                for her. As we sat and spoke as she rested from her battle, she 
                confirmed that I was at Crushbone. Luckily, she was able to point 
                me in the general direction of Kelethin. I offered to help her 
                avoid Orcs and make it back to Kelethin, but she wanted to wait 
                for her companions. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">With 
                that, we wished good fortune to one another and I set out in the 
                general direction of Kelethin. I quickly came upon what looked 
                to be tents or some other temporary structures. Fearing the worst, 
                I set off at a run rather than to investigate further, startling 
                quite a number of brave souls as I rushed by. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                I grew tired, I slowed back to a quick walk, and headed in what 
                seemed to be a southerly direction. I took care to dodge most 
                of the Orcs I could locate in the area, though a few Orc Pawns 
                did bloody the blade of my father's tarnished scimitar. Soon I 
                crossed a well worn path that I recognized as leading back to 
                Kelethin, and not long after the welcome sound of the city lifts 
                met my ears. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Dawn 
                was just peeking through the canopy of trees, as I rode back up 
                to the safety of the city. Having had a long night in the wood, 
                I made my way to a variety of merchants to sell what items I had 
                gathered and to buy the materials necessary to attempt fletching 
                my first arrows. I figured that would give me a much needed reprieve 
                and allow me time to contemplate my mistakes during the night...
