                  meeting of my wife- </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Back 
                  in the days of my youth I had made the trip to the city know 
                  as Freeport from my hometown of Surefall. This was a somewhat 
                  perilous trip, as I was but a young child, un-experienced in 
                  the ways of the world. Plus with only the companionship of my 
                  frail enchanter friend, we would not last long if we were confronted 
                  by any danger. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So 
                  we made our way across the planes of Karana, to the mountains 
                  where High Keep earns it's name. To the dark forests of Kithicor, 
                  and onto the Commonlands, which I must say, really are not that 
                  common. Which leads us to the gates of Freeport, the vile dark 
                  city it is. Infested by Dark elves, Trolls and Ogres. Refuse 
                  in the streets, and beggars on the side. A dark comparison to 
                  the beauty of the city of Qeynos near my home. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well 
                  on exploration of this new town, I came across a group of ladies 
                  from the far lands of Faydwer. Morlinde, a Wood Elf of the same 
                  following as me. Kylea, a follower of the ways of a Warrior. 
                  And Shirenkali, a Paladin determined to banish evil. It seems 
                  these ladies were headed to the fabled Gypsy camps of North 
                  Karana to purchase some of the legendary combine weapons that 
                  they produce. Having traveled the area, and knowing the location 
                  of the camp, I offered to help them on their journey. They graciously 
                  accepted, and we went on our way.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                  trip back to the Karanas went rather un-eventful, we chatted 
                  a bit on the way, learned a bit about each other and some of 
                  our journeys. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Arriving 
                  at the camp, we kept a lookout for the various types of Griffon 
                  spawn that roamed the area, after a few close calls the ladies 
                  each had purchased their weapons. We moved to a safe location 
                  to discuss what their plans were from here on out. They all 
                  decided that they would return to their homeland for the time 
                  being, and needed a guide back to Freeport. Being the generous 
                  Ranger that I am, I donated my services again to them. We made 
                  our way back to High Hold, where they decided they could make 
                  it the rest of the way on their own. Saddened at having to leave 
                  these ladies defenseless and without a guide, I bid them farewell. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">On 
                  my way back to my homeland I thought over the whole trip, and 
                  how the Warrior Kylea caught my eye. She was a lively one, and 
                  someone that I could really grow to like. Little did I know 
                  that she would become my wife that I love to this day. And so 
                  we were joined as I had seen, and we have a wonderful life together, 
                  many battles have been won and lost together, and I wouldn't 
                  have any other as my wife. </font></p>
