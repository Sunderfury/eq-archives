                from Norrath</font></b> 
              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Leaning 
                against the tree, I am impressed with the amount of shade this 
                giant fir manages to produce. The trees of Surefall have always 
                brought peace after a days long journey. Surely Tunare had a grand 
                vision when she fashioned this place. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Glancing 
                around the Glade, I casually watch a few fellows trying their 
                aim on the practice target. One nocks his arrow and lets fly a 
                perfect shot, piercing the center with ease. The second lad, not 
                to be outdone, steadies a bladed arrow to his weathered, yet strong 
                longbow. With uncanny aim, the archer sends the arrow towards 
                the target. A sharp crack is heard as the blade deftly slices 
                the first arrow to the point. Laughter erupts and I overhear one 
                gentleman say, "Now if ye could only hit a moving Gnoll!" "Ah, 
                yer Father can't even hit the side of that Inn o'er there," taunts 
                the other. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My 
                thoughts begin to slip... A deep sigh escapes my lips as I drift 
                into thoughts of my parents. I still remember the day my mother 
                came bursting into my room, the tears flowing like so many tiny 
                streams. "What is it mother?" I try and calmly ask, fearing the 
                worst of news. Barely mouthing the words, she whispers, "Your 
                Father..." Jumping to my feet, I grabbed my scabbard and bolt 
                for the door. "Stop!" she commands, and the fury in me subsides 
                a bit with her tone. "Not even the best Clerics in the land could 
                have saved him." "What has happened mother?" I ask, with a lump 
                swelling in my throat. "'Twas a mighty rush of orcs came forth 
                from Crushbone. The orcs had been incited by a recent hunting 
                party violating their sacred land." </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">She 
                continued, her hands shaking, "Your father went to track a legionnaire 
                that was spotted recently. Upon arriving at the small outpost 
                of orcs outside of Crushbone, a mighty wave of orcs overcame him. 
                He had no chance to survive as the mass of 20 orcs cut at him 
                from all sides. A passing mage under the protection of invisibility 
                witnessed the event and stood helplessly at the sheer number of 
                the fiends. Upon seeing the carnage, he quickly teleported to 
                our city and told the town Elders." </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
                rage like none other turned my face the brightest of crimson. 
                Sensing my fire, my mother placed her hand on my shoulder and 
                bade me sit. Moments later, my sobs were muffled as my face lay 
                buried in my mothers embrace. My 17 seasons of life had seemingly 
                come to an end with the loss I was facing. Overcome with despair 
                and tired from the day's work, sleep overtook me as my mother 
                watched over her only son. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Many 
                hours passed while she went about the grisly task of addressing 
                my fathers recovered belongings. Suddenly, a shout arose from 
                the ground beneath our small shack. "The orcs have come!" Terrified, 
                I jumped to my feet, unsheathing my sword in one slight move. 
                I urged my mother to the back of the room and extinguished the 
                lone candle on the table. Slowly, moving backward to where my 
                mother stood, I moved my hands over the surfaces I had come to 
                know so well. Passing near the table on the left, I felt the unmistakable 
                outline of my fathers sword and silently whispered, "Mother, it 
                is time I wielded father's blade!" When I entered my 17th season, 
                my father had shown me of a new technique of fighting with two 
                swords. Now, I thought, was the time I needed it most. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                grasped my father's sword, feeling the history of it. He often 
                said the sword emerged from the time of the Combine Empire and 
                I could feel now that his words rang true. Shifting my Fine Steel 
                Longsword into my other hand, I felt a magical presence in my 
                right hand as the sword melded perfectly within my grip. Orcish 
                cries became more prevalent as the sound of fighting grew louder. 
                I could barely make out the guttural cry of "Emperor Crush!" coming 
                from the foul things. All the while, the screams of friends rang 
                deep in my ears. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
                faint sound at the front door got my attention as I silenced my 
                mothers whimpering. As I peered through the darkness, relying 
                on my natural ability to see in the dark, I saw the door cautiously 
                swing open. A smallish orc, no doubt sent to scout out the houses, 
                appeared in the doorway. I have heard of the orc pawns that plague 
                the region for younger adventurers, but had not thought of them 
                to be so foolish. Knowing that I could best him easily, I cry 
                out, "For my father!" and lunge towards the surprised beast. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                door is a mere 15 paces away, yet the orc has time to react since 
                I foolishly yelled my attack. "Centurions, by my side!" he spouts 
                with a blood curdling scream. I pause midstride as I see three 
                hulking figures emerge from the darkness beyond. A quick glance 
                causes my heart to pound as two centurions lumber towards me and 
                then I see it, the undeniable garb of an orc emissary! A flash 
                of lighting from a fast approached storm affirms this nightmare 
                unfolding. My instinct overcomes fear and one swift strike from 
                my father's sword extinguishes the pawns miserable life. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                mutter a few elven words and watch as the roots ensnare the large 
                emissary, slowing his progress. Alarmed with my quickness, the 
                centurion's pause, considering what to do next. One quick bark 
                from the emissary, however, and they resume their onslaught. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                meet the first with a glancing blow to the thigh. The second spins 
                around me, lurching towards my mother. A morbid fear infuriates 
                me as I lunge at the second orc, bent on protecting my mother. 
                The first centurion, noticing my back turned, lands a well placed 
                blow to my right leg, tearing the leather leggings from it. Thank 
                Tunare, the meager leather prevented the slicing of my leg. I 
                quickly recover and land a swift strike to the centurion advancing 
                on my mother. Amazingly, my off hand responds with a similar blow, 
                knocking the centurion to the floor. I whirl as the other starts 
                to swing, sidestepping the strike and land a stinging blow to 
                the orc. Screaming in pain, the orc backs off a step. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"Sun!&quot; 
                my mother yells. I turn around and see the first orc has recovered 
                to his feet. "Argghhh!" I bellow. Arcane words erupt from my lips 
                as a burst of fire begin to flash about my hands. With horror, 
                I watch the orc raise his scimitar, an evil grin crossing his 
                twisted face. My legs propel me with all the speed I can manage, 
                interrupting my incantation, as the flash of the orc's blade cuts 
                through my mother's chest. "Noooo!" I scream, watching my mother 
                slump to the floor. A rage fills me as I mutter more words. The 
                orc writhes in agony as the flame sears his body. One final slash 
                with my sword and the beast falls lifeless to the ground. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Pain 
                wracks me as the first centurion crushes my left arm with his 
                mace. My arm falls limp as I whirl to face my attacker. I cringe 
                as I see the Emissary almost upon the fight. With a cry, I slash 
                the orc and follow with a solid kick to his torso. Stunned, a 
                look of fear overcomes the orc as he sees the rage in my eyes. 
                Flame again erupts from my hands as the fire scorches the stunned 
                orc. I lunge again, a massive strike from my blade tears the very 
                limb from the dying orc. I follow this strike with a fatal blow 
                to the neck of the doomed beast. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Near 
                exhaustion, I almost forget the now free emissary charging at 
                me. He crumples me with a bash of immense power. As I am stunned, 
                he punches me in the face, nearly blacking me out. When I slump, 
                the orc looks bewildered at the sight of his fallen companions. 
                Out of the corner of my eye, I see my mother, seemingly lifeless 
                on the floor. The sight of her renews my fury and I leap to my 
                feet. Quickly, I mutter the words of ensnaring roots and dash 
                from the house as they take hold. The surprised orc stumbles towards 
                me, barely progressing. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Seeing 
                this opportunity, I call on Tunare and her healing touch. The 
                words infuse me with life and my left arm mends. The orc, still 
                advancing is about 20 paces away. I quickly pull my bow to the 
                front of me, loosing 3 quick shots. The orc screams in pain as 
                the arrows pierce his pathetic robes. Seeing his pain I swing 
                the bow around while chanting the words of fire again. Flame now 
                engulfs the orc as he plods towards me. I run to the beast with 
                a powerful kick to his sternum. The orc flails while my blades 
                wreak havoc on his limbs. Knowing his death comes soon, the orc 
                turns to flee, yet my roots have stopped him in his now fatigued 
                state. With a deft swing, I behead the vile thing and collapse 
                in sheer exhaustion. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mother! 
                I crawl to the door of our shack, peering in at her still body. 
                With my last ounce of strength, I pull myself to her side. She 
                is alive! "Sunmoon," she whispers, &quot;I am quickly failing." 
                "No!" I cry, the tears burning the lacerations on my face. I summon 
                the last of my mental energy and whisper the healing words and 
                she is visibly better, yet, her wounds continue to bleed. "You 
                are a brave son," she says. "Your father would have been so proud 
                of you this eve." "Shhh," I say, and lay her head in my lap for 
                comfort. Darkness surrounds me as I slip out of consciousness... 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Moments 
                later a hand shakes my shoulder. "Lad! Are you ok?" I am startled 
                and quickly look up. One of the villagers had come to check on 
                us. He looks around at the bodies of the orcs and says, "You did 
                this all boy?" "Aye," I reply, "they attacked my mother and I." 
                I quickly turn to wake her. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"Mother?' 
                I whisper. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"Mother?" 
                as I shake her. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"Mother!" 
                I cry out feeling the cold touch of her skin upon my hand. "Lad, 
                " the villager says, "'tis indeed a day of sorrow for you and 
                us all." I peer up to him, tears welling in my eyes, "If you only 
                knew friend..." </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"Sunmoon!" 
                the guard says, "Stop sleeping in the Glade." I come to my senses 
                and realize I had been thinking of my parents. "No my friend, 
                I was merely thinking of days gone by" I say. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"Why 
                *do* you have that surname friend?" the guard asks. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"Solusterra?" 
                I inquire. "It means to be alone in the world," I respond, thinking 
                of my loved ones gone. "There is much sorrow in this world friend 
                and I am no stranger to it..." </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"Hrmff, 
                " he mutters and walks off. </font></p>

                gather my belongings and set off, hoping to find the happiness
