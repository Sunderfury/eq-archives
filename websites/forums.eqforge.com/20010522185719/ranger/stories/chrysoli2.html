                <br>
                The storm drove on deep into the night. Thunder rumbled and jagged 
                streaks of lightening raced across a leaden Rivervale sky. Wet 
                and so cold... moving gingerly to the town&#39;s small lake, nursing 
                my aching legs, I dropped to my knees and peered over the embankment. 
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Tunare...&#34; a soft plea, a sigh maybe, but for certain 
                an acknowledgment of the gruesome visage reflected in the dark, 
                wind-swept lake escaped my lips. Was this really me staring back? 
                I choked in dismay at the stringy, blood-matted hair... the swollen, 
                bruised face. Angry welts lanced the weary, trembling arms straining 
                to support the battered body peering up at me. A tattered, sopping-wet 
                under-blouse barely clung about my shoulders. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Ow,&#34; I groaned as I slowly stood back up. Yes, that was 
                indeed me, I conceded. While Tunare had found me worthy, for she 
                had restored me to the world of the living after my fearsome beating 
                at the hands of Chief Goonda, she must also be unhappy with me 
                about something. If she wasn&#39;t upset with something I&#39;d 
                done, then why had she sent me back in such a bedraggled state? 
                What had I done to fall from grace? <br>
                <br>
                &#34;A lesson perhaps?&#34; <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Oh no,&#34; I answered quietly, more to myself then to the 
                stealthy, unannounced visitor standing behind me. I knew that 
                voice, and though embarrassed by my current sorry state, I was 
                happy for a friend and slowly turned around. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Elly!&#34; I said rather sheepishly, then curiously added. 
                &#34;Now what brings you out to the water&#39;s edge on such a 
                frightful night?&#34; <br>
                <br>
                &#34;I was up late. I suppose it was just chance that saw me staring 
                out at the storm and you limping to water&#39;s edge.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                I didn&#39;t believe that for a second, but then, Elly was prone 
                to make light of things she wanted to hold close to herself. In 
                fact, few could really tell when she was serious or just pulling 
                your leg. Eleanor was her real name of course, Eleanor Cuckleburr, 
                but those close to her affectionately called her Elly. I had known 
                her for many years and a close friendship had developed between 
                the diminutive halfling druid and myself. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;You are a sad looking mess,&#34; Elly bluntly declared. &#34;Let&#39;s 
                get you cleaned up, and a bit of food will work wonders also.&#34; 
                Pointing to the docks, Elly threw me a bar of soap. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;You&#39;ve got to be kidding?!&#34; I exclaimed. <br>
                <br>
                Elly smiled, &#34;You just get yourself bathed. I&#39;ll take 
                care of Fiddy so you&#39;ll not have to worry about his prying 
                eyes. Once I get him yapping, he&#39;ll not stop to worry about 
                some human washing up under his boardwalk. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;But this storm... I could wash up just as well in a room 
                at The Fool&#39;s Gold.&#34; I countered. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;And how will you pay for that room? You haven&#39;t even 
                the pockets to carry gold, much less actually have any, and the 
                bank is certainly closed at this hour. Besides, looking like you 
                do, I doubt they&#39;d let you in. You&#39;d probably scare away 
                what few patrons they have.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Fine! All right,&#34; I conceded. &#34;You just keep Fiddy 
                busy!&#34; <br>
                <br>
                Elly was right of course and after cleaning up I felt much better. 
                Together, we sought shelter from the driving rain inside the dock 
                house. Elly prepared a small meal from her pack supplies and before 
                long I was fast asleep. Refreshingly clean, with a full stomach 
                and a tight roof over my head, I slept soundlessly long past sunrise. 
                <br>
                <br>
                It was the drilling of Fiddy&#39;s incessant questioning &#34;... 
                send help?&#34; that finally forced me from my dreams. &#34;Oh 
                please!&#34; I mumbled, &#34;don&#39;t you ever shut up?&#34; 
                <br>
                <br>
                Thankfully Fiddy couldn&#39;t hear me over his self-absorbed monologue 
                but Elly shouted out good-naturedly from the docks, &#34;Lazy 
                humans! It&#39;s about time you got up... and leave poor Fiddy 
                alone dear, he&#39;s just been cooped up on dry dock a bit too 
                long.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                &#34;I&#39;ll say!&#34; I shouted back as I walked out to join 
                Elly on the docks. It was already mid-morning and the day was 
                shaping up to be fair and warm. My spirits were much improved 
                over last night. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;I have some fresh fish cooked for breakfast... well, it&#39;s 
                lunch-time now.&#34; Elly said. Let&#39;s get you a hot meal, 
                a few supplies and I&#39;ll travel with you to West Karana. I&#39;m 
                sure you&#39;re anxious to recover your missing gear. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Elly, thanks for your help last night, and thanks for the 
                offer, but I&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;m not without some resources 
                and with a few simple precautions, the journey isn&#39;t hazardous. 
                I&#39;ll be able to stay well clear of the ogres. In fact, I was 
                a good distance from their camp when Goonda overtook me.&#34; 
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Ah, so that&#39;s what happened!&#34; Elly stared hard at 
                me. &#34;You are quite the foolish one trying to roust that camp. 
                I thought you had better sense. What possessed you to attempt 
                that?&#34; <br>
                <br>
                &#34;I didn&#39;t,&#34; I hastened to explain. &#34;I was scouting 
                only and didn&#39;t realize the range of vision Goonda has. He 
                caught me by surprise.&#34; Elly patiently listened as I sat down 
                and told my tale. Finishing my story and the last bits of fish 
                from my plate, I stood back up and turned towards the lake, &#34;Last 
                night, when you snuck up on me, you said &#39;Perhaps it was a 
                lesson&#39;. What did you mean Elly?&#34; <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Snuck?&#34; she chuckled. &#34;You were so concerned about 
                your looks a hill giant could have walked up, tapped you on the 
                shoulder, and you would have scarcely noticed I think.&#34; Packing 
                up her own gear, Elly got to her feet, &#34;Chrys, I&#39;ve told 
                you before, you don&#39;t like to hear it, but I&#39;ll tell you 
                again, your vanity is going to get you killed. I hope it isn&#39;t 
                the death of us all.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                Shaking my russet locks in the slight morning breeze, I turned 
                to face Elly. &#34;I&#39;ve conceded to wear that heavy banded 
                armor, even though it makes me feel like one of those dancing 
                floozies in a cheap Qeynos tavern. I&#39;ll not, however, drape 
                slabs of garish red metal about my body or stuff my head inside 
                a tin sack!&#34; <br>
                <br>
                Shaking her head sadly, &#34;Well, perhaps your Tunare was telling 
                you that looks are not as important as you think.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Elly, I stood no chance against Goonda and his men. No armor 
                or hat would have saved me. No druid spell or roguish stealth 
                could have prevented what was ordained.&#34; I calmed a bit, but 
                Elly only continued shaking her head in her best matronly halfling 
                manner. <br>
                <br>
                We locked eyes for an eternity it seems, till Elly broke our silence. 
                &#34;You&#39;re going back not just to reclaim lost weapons. You&#39;re 
                going to try and kill Goonda aren&#39;t you,&#34; she stated, 
                more then asked, matter-of-factly. <br>
                <br>
                Though I said nothing, the look on my face clearly marked my intent. 
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Then you are twice the fool I feared. You cannot hope to 
                vanquish him, much less that entire camp.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                Though I tried to ignore Elly&#39;s last comment, it echoed with 
                bitter resonance. &#34;Goodbye Elly, I must be going. My thanks 
                again for your aid,&#34; was all I answered. With fell determination 
                I ran towards the tunneled exit from Rivervale... back towards 
                West Karana. <br>
                <br>
                &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; 
                &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; <br>
                <br>
                Elly watched for a few moments as the figure of Chrysoli disappearing 
                in the tunnel gloom. &#34;May your Tunare protect you, my foolish 
                young friend. Though, I suppose, were it Rivervale and Ogres had 
                taken residence...&#34; <br>
                <br>
                Her mind made up, Elly quickly started an incantation, one that 
                allowed her to travel vast distances in the blink of an eye. &#34;Time 
                to gather the wolves,&#34; she sighed. &#34;And the other two 
                will come also... to far off West Karana our fates are tied.&#34; 
                With a brilliant flash, Eleanor disappeared from fair Rivervale. 
                <br>
