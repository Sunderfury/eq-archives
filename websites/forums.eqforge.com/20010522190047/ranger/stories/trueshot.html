                from Norrath</font></b> 
              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Trueshot Longbow quest is very much in vogue right now, and for 
                good reason as the bow is a very good one. My introduction to 
                the quest was when Tanthilas approached me with the materials 
                for the bow, asking if I'd make the attempt for him. At the time, 
                I was at 148. I figured that if I'm good enough for an Ashwood, 
                I'm good enough for a quest bow. Combine. Failed. Rats. Combine. 
                Failed. RATS. Combine. Failed. RATS! I burned through poor Tanthilas's 
                materials in no time, leaving him with nothing to show for his 
                efforts. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                piqued my curiosity and made me intent to successfully fletch 
                one of these bows. So I started in on the quest. To my surprise, 
                this quest is a little entailed and definitely time-consuming. 
                Make sure you have lots of room in your inventory for it. Especially 
                if you're not sure if one attempt will be sufficient. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                a variety of flubs and miscues which are a bit of a story in themselves, 
                I ended up with enough ingredients for 3 attempts of my own. Burning 
                two microservos per attempt is painful, considering the difficulty 
                of obtaining microservos. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">An 
                aside here. The first time I went microservo hunting, I found 
                a valley FULL of beasts that are rumored to carry them. I methodically 
                worked my way through them and landed quite a number of microservos. 
                The next time I visited that valley, however, the pickings were 
                quite a bit slimmer and I was obliged to actually pursue purchasing 
                them from others. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So 
                I had materials for three attempts, and attempt I did. Combine. 
                Failed. Rats. Combine. Failed. RATS! Combine. Failed. Sigh. Obviously, 
                148 with a 75 WIS, 85 INT and 110AGI isn't going to cut it. I 
                fletched a little more and gained one small insight into my chosen 
                skill - after realizing that I was using the 3PP vanes instead 
                of the 1PP vanes! So much money wasted! </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                next day, while I was wandering through Kelethin, a dwarf put 
                out a call for a master fletcher. "That's me" I thought with pride. 
                "How can I help you, sir dwarf?" I asked. "I need a fletcher to 
                assemble a Trushot Longbow for me". Rats. I informed the dwarf 
                of my miserable record in attempting the bow, yet he was game 
                for me to try another. Combine. Failed. Deep sigh. All I could 
                do was offer my apologies to the noble dwarf who had entrusted 
                to me the results of his quest. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ah, 
                but that's not ALL I could do. It was time to take steps. After 
                consulting with more competent fletchers, I learned that increasing 
                my intelligence should have a positive effect on my fletching. 
                Well, I had my hard-won cash from my adventuring. What better 
                use to put it to than my favorite project - fletching. A friend 
                of mine is a jeweler, who offered me magical rings to make me 
                more intelligent, and I purchased a necklace of charisma from 
                a merchant passing through Kelethin. Ready now for Toastmasters 
                and Mensa, I decided to dive into my fletching again wholeheartedly. 
                I assembled arrow after arrow and found my skill increasing over 
                time. But only to about 156. An admirable gain, but my adventuring 
                obviously hadn't left me as rich as I might have hoped. That Bone 
                Bladed Claymore had cut into my reserves quite a bit. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well, 
                I was at 156, was rather low on cash and had no materials to make 
                another attempt on the Trueshot Longbow. Feeling the end of the 
                day creeping up on me, I decided to visit Crushbone to see if 
                the Warlord was about. Just before entering that den of evil, 
                I heard another call from the direction of Kelethin - "Services 
                of a Master Fletcher needed". "That's me" I thought, more confidently 
                than before. I encountered Varrus, a tall warrior. "How can I 
                help you?" I asked with a certain sense of deja vu. "Can you assemble 
                a Trueshot Longbow for me?" he replied. This was either fate smiling 
                on me or laughing at me. I was soon to discover which it was. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                again began my cautionary tale of my attempts at constructing 
                this legendary bow, yet Varrus was intent upon the successful 
                construction of one, and so concocted a scheme. He would finance 
                me for a bit more training in fletching, and I would try to reach 
                160 in skill. He had heard good things about that skill level. 
                Certainly this was a deal for me, and Varrus was tenacious in 
                the extreme. I agreed to the plan. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We 
                assembled 45 platinum pieces between us, and we also used every 
                wiley technique we could imagine to make the most of the available 
                cash. We pooled our magical items that contributed to intelligence 
                and charisma, even borrowing items from kind Tanthilas who seemed 
                to magically appear at the most propitious moment. And fletching 
                began. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                arrow fletching pattern was a common one, and typically harrowing. 
                The first fletching attempt immediately produced new insights 
                into the miracles of fletching. But the next 20 fletchings produced 
                nothing new. Sell what I had constructed, buy new raw materials 
                and repeat. Almost all the way through the next batch with no 
                new insights and then back to back insights! Each new insight 
                gave both Varrus and myself increased confidence that I could 
                fletch a Trueshot Longbow. But I had suspicions that I should 
                delve as deeply as possible into the mysteries of fletching. So 
                I fletched until we could only purchase components for a few bundles 
                of arrows. I wasn't content that I knew enough, but we were at 
                the end of our resources. And Tunare blessed us with two new insights 
                in the last few arrows I fletched and I found that what I had 
                found so challenging before was now trivial! This was certainly 
                a sign. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
                short, I had reached 162. <<...>> </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Next 
                we were off to visit the learned Maesyn Trueshot to obtain the 
                needed materials for the bow. Varrus assembled fletching kits 
                for my use and I performed the fletchings with my newly-found 
                insights. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Combine. 
                Failed. Oh no. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It 
                all seemed so simple just moments before. What had I failed to 
                comprehend? I stand before my new friend and my training master 
                unable to construct this bow of Rangers. Vallus's tenacity was 
                unaffected by my failure and he quietly presented me with a fletching 
                kit, ready for another try. Inspired by his confidence, I set 
                about my task. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Combine. 
                SUCCESS! Praise Tunare! </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Without 
                a word, I handed this first masterpiece to Varrus. A silly grin 
                spread across his face as he saw what I was handing him, and I 
                found myself grinning with equal joy. But Varrus wasn't finished. 
                He handed me another fletching kit, filled with the components 
                for this magnificent bow. "Now one for you" he stated matter-of-factly. 
                I held my breath and began my task, hoping and praying that Tunare 
                would bless my current attempt as greatly as my prior. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Combine. 
                Success! Woohoo! </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                held the bow before me, smiling like a fool. Varrus turned and 
                saw that I too possessed this fine bow. We smiled and laughed 
                and started discussing the value of the bows, both as a trade 
                good and as a weapon of a ranger. But having reached our goal 
                of assembling the two bows, we found ourselves fading, unable 
                to even keep our eyes open. The adrenalin of the chase had sustained 
                us. But now, having achieved our goal and safe in the arms of 
                the guild, we both quickly dozed off, Trueshot Longbows still 
                gripped firmly in hand.</font></p>
