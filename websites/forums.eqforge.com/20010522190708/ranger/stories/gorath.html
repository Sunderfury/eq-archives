                Gorath stopped and looked up at the moon and smiled to himself, 
                thinking this was a good night to hunt. He continued on the way, 
                following the tracks of a caiman, whom he had spotted in the distance, 
                the tracks still fresh. Looking up peridically for the dreaded 
                sand giants and hiding when necessary, he began to make his way 
                towards the docks, his prey finally coming into sight...from the 
                depth of the tracks, and the size of the beast....Gorath was sure 
                it would offer them a chance to increase their skills. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Motioning 
                for his group to join him, the lovely magician Twilite and their 
                new friend, the rogue Felzar, he came to a stop atop the hill 
                looking down. Noticing something disturbing ahead, he murmured 
                the words to a minor cantrip, and his vision doubled. What he 
                saw caused him to stop in his tracks......a skeleton, a dry bone 
                unless he is mistaken, and one well experienced. So well experienced 
                that Gorath felt his skin turn cold and the hairs on the back 
                of his neck start to stand up at the pure evilness of it. Pointing 
                towards it and feeling a rush of courage, Gorath quickly asked 
                his party....what do ye think...do we take the chance. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Quickly 
                taking in his partys strengths....himself of the 15th circle, 
                his companion Twilite a mage of the 15th circle and Felzar, a 
                rogue of the 14th circle, who had proven himself steadfast in 
                combat. Turning to the side he saw Twilites pet, a beast of fire...and 
                nodded. Whispering to them, he said quickly.....these are dangerous 
                beasts....but I believe we may take him out..what say you. Felzar 
                studied the beast and nodded... keeping silent... while Twilite 
                shivered a little where she stood and said....I do not know, but 
                we must do something quickly, for it leaves! </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Gorath 
                turned back around, and sure enough, the beast was starting to 
                leave....walking and swaying with its own delusions of life and 
                power....and that was it. Gorath had to rid the world of this 
                foul beast. Steeling himself for the upcoming battle, he whispers 
                words of power, and the licks of flame left his hand and covered 
                the beast, but to his dismay they seemed to have no effect. The 
                beast charged them, and battle began!! Naturally the dry bones 
                targeted Gorath, the one who had cast upon him, and began to tear 
                into him. The battle continued for several moments, almost frozen 
                in time, seemingly going exactly even....the beast having parts 
                fall off, while his own party bleeding from several wounds, all 
                in the battle extremely hurt. Begining to grow a little desperate, 
                Gorath called upon the powers of tunare, and tried to root the 
                foul beast.... 3 times over, but each time the powerful beast 
                resisted the spells. He then tried to wash the beast in bursts 
                of flame, but to no avail. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Begining 
                to wobble on his feet now, his swings coming slower and slower, 
                but still biting into the beast, he thought of backing out to 
                take a breather and try a differnt tactic, but one look around 
                told him that his party was so badly hurt if he even tried to 
                take the time to heal once, they would surely perish, so he kept 
                in the battle, yelling insults and swinging with all his might. 
                Finally, the great dry bones almost dead itself landed a fercious 
                blow... pain fell over Gorath and to the ground he fell...slain 
                by the beast. As he was closing his eyes....he saw the dry bones 
                fall to the ground next to him.....and his last thought was to 
                look at his companions, and seeing them all about to fall down 
                unconscious.... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Awakening 
                some time later at the docks of Freeport....he was immediatly 
                assaulted by many voices congratulating him on his stand against 
                the beast. His party members assured him it was dead, and that 
                his acts had kept them alive at the end of the battle. He was 
                told he should feel proud of the battle, for he held his own in 
                a battle against a much more powerful creature. At the same time, 
                Felzar pointed out that he felt sorry, for all they had gotten 
                for their hard work was some bone chips, at the cost of Goraths 
                life, but he shrugged it off...for that happens. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">At 
                that time, a spellcasting desert madman happened upon his party, 
                and the mage gated to safety, while the rogue ran for the safety 
                of the next land. After making sure they were ok, Gorath set out 
                to retrieve his items...his mind still thinking about the battle 
                with the dry bones, in which he held his own....but fell just 
                short of personal victory... </font></p>
