                  Before Dawn One night after a long days hunt in the Oasis, I 
                  sit to recover from my wounds on one of the many stony pillars 
                  protruding from the ocean. It had been a very successful day 
                  for me, as I had learned much about my newly acquired skill 
                  of dual weilding, and had made quite a bit a profit in coins 
                  and collected loot. The hunt was far from over for me, however, 
                  as I was determined to gain enough experience so that I may 
                  finally group with some of my older friends who have always 
                  been one step ahead of me. This night, as are many such in the 
                  oasis, was crowded with nearly one hundred other hunters who 
                  wished to gain experience as well. Many of which were hunting 
                  the docile crocodiles and camiens which inhabited the area, 
                  I despise such doings, but alas, was powerless to stop them, 
                  for now. There were also others of higher rank who hunted the 
                  various sand giants that wander around the dunes. I prayed for 
                  the souls of these foolish ones who would risk their lives against 
                  a being that could crush me with only one blow. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                  myself was hunting something that not many people hunt there, 
                  which were dune taratulas, fearsome spiders that wander the 
                  sands. They were great experience, and I could use their silks 
                  to tailor some very nice armors for the many monks and magicians 
                  that inhabited the area, which I could then use to fund my fletching. 
                  I had gotten bored searching out these spiders, as I had slain 
                  too many and there numbers had become scarce, forcing me to 
                  track the sands for miles before finding them. I went back to 
                  the beach are to look for a partner to help me hunt the various 
                  undead that roam the sands. There are powerful undead here indeed. 
                  In my search for the spiders I had caught the scent of many 
                  mummies, a few rotting ghouls, and some very fearsome desert 
                  skeletons known as dry bones. I dared not hunt these creatures 
                  alone, for it would be certain death. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                  combing the beach for a few moments, I saw a well armored knight 
                  sitting on the pier, recovering from battle. He wielded an almost 
                  gigantic sword, and on his back laid a quiver of arrows on top 
                  of a magnificently crafted darkwood bow. I had never seen a 
                  bow like his before, even my trueshot paled in comparison to 
                  this bow's beautiful craftsmanship. It must have taken truly 
                  a master in fletching to make such a bow, for it was created 
                  with two cams! I though truly, with our combined strengths we 
                  could take down any beast that roams these sands. So, I approached 
                  the knight and greeted him. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">His 
                  name was Silias and he proceeded to tell me that he was looking 
                  for a partner as well. We made the agreement that I would find 
                  monsters for us to slay, since my tracking easily allowed me 
                  to find any foe that I wish. I sniffed the air and began to 
                  look around for a trail, then I caught an odor most foul indeed. 
                  "Orcs", I said to myself. I harbored a deep hatred for these 
                  creatures, for when I was young, I had a brother not more than 
                  a year older than me who I adored greatly. One day, while in 
                  the trees of kelethin, we were playing with our toys bows, dreaming 
                  about how we would both be great ranger when we got older. Then, 
                  either by fate or accident, my brother fell from the trees and 
                  broke his leg, our mother was at the market buying supplies, 
                  and there was noone around to help him. Suddenly an orc centurion 
                  set upon him, and I watched in fear, crying my eyes out as the 
                  orc tore my brother'' body to pieces and consumed him wholly 
                  before my very eyes. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Wiping 
                  a stray tear from my eye, I snapped back to the present. The 
                  orc was in my visual range, as I started toward him, I could 
                  feel a mighty anger and rage overcome me. But my trainig had 
                  taught me better than to run into a fight in such ways. Instead, 
                  I nocked my best arrow, and sent the bladed steel rod singing 
                  through the air. The arrow hit the beast in his lower abdomen, 
                  yet he yanked it out as if it were a mere thorn. This seemed 
                  very odd to me, but I shrugged it off and began to run back 
                  to where Silias lay in waiting. When I arrived, Silias was ready, 
                  sword in hand, for battle. Before I could even turn around, 
                  the orc was suddenly upon me, I felt his axe sink into my shoulder, 
                  nearly rending it from my body. I was stunned, unable to lift 
                  my sword, as the orc continued to beat me from behind. Silias 
                  was striking the orc in the back repeatedly, but the orc seemed 
                  hell bent on ending my life and continued to pummel me into 
                  the sand. Barely able to move, I turned around to face my attacker, 
                  determined to at least strike him once before I died. Amidst 
                  the beatings, I saw Silias in the background, chanting a spell. 
                  I thanked the gods, for I assumed my companion must be a paladin 
                  and was going to use his god-given powers to heal me, and turn 
                  the orc upon himself. However, instead of the glowing blue light 
                  I had seen coming from the hands of my high elven paladin brothers 
                  back home, Silias's hands glowed a sickly green, and all of 
                  a sudden his undead pet sprung forth from the sands. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Then 
                  I thought I would surely die, for this human had decieved me 
                  and was helping the orc to destroy me. Much to my surprise however, 
                  Silias and his evil pet began to attack the orc. Silias's pet 
                  was almost immediatley destroyed and the orc was upon me again. 
                  As I lay bleeding to death, I looked up to the sky, ready to 
                  greet tunare. I looked at Silias one last time, to see that 
                  his anger had grown and that his eye's began to glow red. He 
                  jumped on the orc's back and placed his hand's upon its shoudlers. 
                  The orc screamed in pain as the very life was drained from it 
                  by Silias' dark god. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                  orc's body fell limp to the ground, as the last bit of consiousness 
                  left me. I awakend the next day, barley alive, drenched in my 
                  own blood and the green filth of the orc's. I found strength 
                  in my legs as I staggered to get up. As I looked about me, all 
                  I saw were tracks in the sand and a bloody note left by Silias. 
                  Alas, it was written in dark speech, which I cannot decipher. 
                  Perhaps one day I will be able to read it. I still do not understand 
                  what happened that eve, I had always been told that the followers 
                  of Innoruk are pure killers, yet this one saved my life. I gathered 
                  up my belongings and started down the tracked sand, determined 
                  to find out why...</font></p>
