              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;Night 
                falls in Surefall Glade. You walk into the cabin on the lake, 
                seeking some sage advice. A lone half-elven ranger rests at a 
                table, drinking some ale. He nods and waves you over. &quot;Greetings, 
                I am Baratol Alaryn,&quot; he says. &quot;So you want to know 
                the basics of grouping, eh?&quot; He stares over at the wall a 
                moment, then looks back at you. &quot;Well, I’ve done quite a 
                bit of travelling so far. Parties are the only way to get by in 
                this hostile world. But, it’s a long speech, and my mug is dry…&quot; 
                He grins slyly.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;Before 
                you can learn how to be effective in a group, you must know enough 
                about yourself. As a ranger, you have the potential to cause a 
                fair amount of damage to an opponent with your weapons alone. 
                Not quite as much as a warrior, but close. With dual wield, you 
                can surpass paladins and shadow knights as well. However, melee 
                combat is not your only specialty, as you also have the ability 
                to cast minor spells. These grow in power as you progress, but 
                of course, never coming close to the prowess of a true spellcaster. 
                Nonetheless, spells are a useful tool to have. Early on, you match 
                the other fighter-types in armor, but eventually, they will pass 
                by you in that aspect, for we are restricted in our choices of 
                armor. With the skills of Dodge and Parry, we can still avoid 
                damage, but just not quite as well.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;Of 
                course, all this knowledge is important for being in parties. 
                First, you will have to meld your techniques into the dynamics 
                of grouping effectively. By knowing your strengths and weaknesses, 
                you can do so quite efficiently. First, you will be expected to 
                stand on the front lines and dish out pain with your blades. That 
                is to be expected. Also, you will be expected to soak up the return 
                blows from your enemies. If you are the only melee-oriented member 
                of your party, trust the healer (hopefully there is one) and stay 
                there unless told to back off. However, if there is another melee-type, 
                such as a warrior, your best bet is to be a trouble-shooter. Rangers 
                are rather effective taunters, especially when you gain the ability 
                to wield two weapons at once. Engage in melee combat as normal, 
                however, keep aware. As soon as you see that a spellslinger is 
                being attacked, go to the rescue. With two swords flashing, and 
                a stream of colorful invective(Taunt), it should be easy to enrage 
                the offending opponent into attacking you rather than the finger-waggler. 
                Who, hopefully, should start casting spells and killing the opponent 
                you now face. Otherwise, you may be placed in the unenviable position 
                of being attacked from both front and back.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;Sometimes, 
                you may find yourself in a group consisting of all melee combatants. 
                In this case, you will be one of the healers, assuming you have 
                reached a sufficient rank in your training. Your spell may not 
                be very potent, but it is better than nothing, after all. When 
                you see a fellow party member is taking damage in large quantities, 
                back off for a moment and cast a healing spell or two. Also remember 
                to cast your Skin Like ---- spell on your allies whenever they 
                need it. It will greatly enhance the fighting abilities of your 
                group. Also, if you are the one taking the heat, back away and 
                hope your opponent does not follow. Cast some healing spells, 
                and back in the fray, if you can. If you are unable to heal yourself 
                sufficiently, feel free to contribute a bit of damage with your 
                direct damage spells. If you lack mana, use your bow. It may be 
                slow, and not exactly the most powerful of weapons, but it will 
                contribute some damage to the battle. You may even critically 
                injure an opponent with a well-placed arrow.</font></p>

                are merely basic concepts to grouping, but nonetheless, are important. 
                Keep them in mind, and you should do well.&quot; The wiry half-elf 
                stands up and stretches. &quot;Ahh…Well, best of luck. And if 
                ye see any gnolls, give them a taste of steel, would ye?&quot; 
                He smiles ferally, then gathers his equipment and quietly exits 
                the cabin.</font></p>
