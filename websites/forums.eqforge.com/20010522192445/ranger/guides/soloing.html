                soloing guide for Rangers</b> </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well 
                get used to traveling first off, and second you have to be able 
                to memorize the environment. The main thing that helps me is I 
                can learn a place and set it vaguely to memory the first time 
                I go, and the second time I go I pretty much have it set in my 
                memory. The first key is to know twist turn and spawn place in 
                your surondings. That being said here is where I went and when. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">14-17, 
                22-24: paw - I cannot remember exactly what lvls stuff was in 
                here. I belive that at first the guards would give me exp and 
                are fairly easy to get one at a time. There is also a shaman that 
                spawns by himself that should give exp. There is a gap because 
                at 22 you can pull the bosses and solo them rather than the trash 
                types. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">17-19: 
                Lavastorm - Rock derv's are good exp, as are the lava crawlers, 
                and drakes. Be sure to fight at the zone line though, keep your 
                fire res spell up and save some mana to snare a wandering fire 
                ele if they happen to float by so you can run. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">19-31: 
                Upper Guk - Probably one of the most versitile places out there. 
                It is hard at 19, but you should be able to pull a few Tuk's solo 
                and get good exp. Then move up to gaz, and once the gaz warriors 
                stop attacking you can go on to the special npc locations and 
                get exp that way. This place you REALLY have to know well though 
                to know where the solo spawns are. If you have to fight 2 at a 
                time, snare one and run the other back to the entrance. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">25-31: 
                Cazic Thule - Trains are real nasty but with your cammo on you 
                should be able to pull defenders, warders, and sent's from the 
                maze fairly easy. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">30-31: 
                Runnyeye - The warlord room is a nice place to solo and get exp 
                and decent loot. You have to learn how to break up the spawn though. 
                Pull two out by snareing one and fight the WL and zone. then come 
                back and finish the trash. This might be done at 29 but I think 
                my damage shield tiped the scales. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">25-31: 
                Najena - plenty of stuff in here to solo. TT's, Ogre's, and my 
                favorite is BoneCracker. Just remember to keep them snared. You 
                won't be able to do BC till lvl 30 or so, that is when you can 
                pull him without his friends. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">22-25: 
                Nektulos forest - I like pulling the Dark elf guards and guardians 
                to the zone to lavastorm and fighting them. Not real great exp 
                but there is that revenge factor from all those deaths from Dvinn 
                and Dorn. This is all I can think of right now. There is prolly 
                more but I am sleepy and it is a monday. The limits are at 31 
                cuase that is where i am and i don't know if it will be easier 
                or harder at 32. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                is mainly what I did, it might not work for everyone. Dag(soloist 
                at heart as well) </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Oh 
                and to give you an idea, I made one bub exp in four hours at najena 
                the other day. I think mathin said it takes him 3 hours per bub 
                in a good group. Not too bad I don't think. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                got 16 to 22 in East Karanas starting with carrion spiders,chasm 
                crawlers then moving to gorge hounds,dark stalkers,gnoll reavers, 
                and finally undead reavers to get 22.This was soloing. I suggest 
                getting a partner about 16 or 17 and doing gorge hounds the loot 
                isnt the best but it is good xp. Hunt by the gorge entrance to 
                beholder by the cottages and draw the solo targets close to a 
                wall so not to attract other nasties in mid fight.</font></p>
