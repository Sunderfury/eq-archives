        is the most complete version of the faq. It as full spoilers and complete 
        details on every segment of the quest. If you find this walkthough to 
        be missing anything, please contact me by email [<a href="mailto:crydee@monsterweb.org">crydee@monsterweb.org</a>.]</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Although 
        it is possible to do portions of the quest out of order, this walkthrough 
        assumes that you complete each part before moving on to the next section. 
        Just in case you have done portions of the quest out of order, I have 
        made note of what items you would have if you have been doing the quest 
        in the exact order listed here and which of those are required to complete 
        that part of the quest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">NOTE: 
        If at any point in the quest you need to use sneak to deal with an NPC, 
        you will need to use sneak again at all later encounters. Although I will 
        suggest using sneak the during the first encounter with a potentially 
        problematic NPC, you will need to remember to use it again for later encounters. 
        This mostly concerns Kinlo Strongarm and Mairee Silentone.</font></p>

        Telin Darkforest considers you for a few moments before speaking. 'A great 
        evil walks across the land. The hand of some demon we don't yet know is 
        twisting and polluting forests.'<br>
        You say, 'what evil'<br>
        Telin Darkforest says 'If I knew that, I wouldnt be here looking for answers. 
        I would be elsewhere, looking for solutions. For now, I suspect much but 
        know little.<br>
        You say, 'what do you suspect'<br>
        Telin Darkforest looks at you and sighs. 'The lands are changing. Beasts, 
        large and small, have turned upon those who watched over them. Druids 
        and rangers, worshippers of both Karana and Tunare, have reported a feeling 
        of hatred throughout their once peaceful lands.'<br>
        You say, 'perhaps it is Innoruuk'<br>
        Telin Darkforest raises his eyebrow slightly and a subtle look of surprise 
        creeps across his face. 'Innoruuk? Perhaps. Aye. It must be. Perhaps I 
        knew and didn't want to consider the possibility. It must be this though, 
        and some action will have to be taken.'<br>
        You say, 'what action should I take'<br>
        Telin Darkforest looks at you consideringly and then scribbles something 
        quickly on a small, worn paper. 'You seem powerful enough. Perhaps you 
        can help those who seek to protect nature's peace. Take this note. Deliver 
        it only into the hands of Faelin Bloodbriar. Where you will find her, 
        I cannot say. She is a friend of mine and a wanderer. She has been seen

        go to in order to gather insight into Innoruuk's plans. Giz X'Tin, he

        that he does wander the zone. I have seen hin on track durning the day 
        and night time. The easiest way that I have found to find him is to run 
        along the way between West Commons and Rivervale. If he is up, you will 
        most likely pick him up on tracking. Most likely your faction with Giz 
        X'Tin will not be high enough, cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself, run up

        Giz X`Tin flips you a coin after he recognizes the ring. 'It seems we

        to worry about what that is. Luckily, Lord Innoruuk has informed me of 
        your coming and your desires. Fortunately, I have all the answers you 
        require right here at the end of my friend's blade. I think I'll be paying

        Once the Dark Elf Corruptor is killed, the group killing the Corruptor 
        will take out the reavers. Even though some advocate killing the corruptor 
        and letting the reavers get the druids. I don't recommend this for several 
        reasons. First off, it is not within the theme of the quest to let the

        FACTION ISSUES</a></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">These 
        are listed in the order in which you may run into a faction issue.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>Plane 
        of Growth</b><br>
        Although the Plane of Growth is not used for the quest, it does need special 
        mentioning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>Telin 
        Darkforest [Faydark's Champion]</b><br>
        Telin Darkforest is on Faydark's Champion faction. Any of the Kelethin 
        Ranger quests will give you faction with him. You can also kill orcs in 
        Crushbone.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>Faelin 
        Bloodbriar and Foloal Stormforest [Soldiers of Tunare]</b><br>
        The only way to increase faction with either of these two NPCs is by doing 
        quests for either the Kelethin Ranger or Druid guilds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>Giz 
        X`Tin [unknown]</b><br>
        He is mostly be on one of the Dark Elf Factions and will probably be less 
        than indifferent to you. If this is the case, cast Spirit of Wolf on yourself 
        [to be able to keep up with him] than sneak up behind him so that he will 
        be indifferent to you and then give him the ring. If you give him the 
        ring, while he /CONs dubious [or lower] to you, you will not get the coin 
        to continue the quest.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>Dark 
        Elf Corruptor and Dark Reavers in East Karana [Dark Elf Warrior]</b><br>
        Killing them will not impact faction with the Neriak Guards. This faction 
        will only be noteworthy to any Dark Elves [and to a lesser extent Trolls 
        and Ogres] that may wish to assist you with killing these.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>Alrik 
        Farsight [Keepers of the Art]</b><br>
        To gain faction with Alrik Farsight, visit the Magician Guild in Felwithe 
        [B] and give Niola Impholder Bat Wings until she is amiable to you. If 
        your faction with Niola Impholder is so low that she doesn't give you 
        faction when you turn them in, stand behind her and use sneak to make 
        her indifferent to you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>Kinlo 
        Strongarm &amp; Usbak the Old [unknown]</b><br>
        If your faction with these dwarves is less than indifferent, you will 
        need to stand behind them and use sneak in order to be able to deal with 
        them.</font></p>
