                kneeled as she crested the small rise, scanning the tracks near 
                her. She had been trailing this Gnoll hunter for about an hour 
                now, and she knew she was close. It would be the last day he did 
                any poaching near Surefall Glade. She glanced behind her and sighed. 
                They were still following her, as they had been for a while now. 
                I guess they thought she would lead them to easy prey, this small 
                group of adventurers behind her. She shrugged to herself and rose, 
                trotting down the hill, scanning the treeline in front of her. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Then 
                she saw him, weighed down with the pelts he was carrying, about 
                200 yards in front of her, almost to the trees, already partially 
                hidden by the scrub growing outside the forest. She stopped and 
                raised her arms abover her, chanting in the Elvish language, and 
                she felt the magic course through her body. The Gnoll was surrounded 
                briefly by a greenish glow, then the plants and roots around him 
                began to grab at him, their rough branches ripping through the 
                shabby clothes he wore and into his flesh. He had enough time 
                to turn and howl in frustration before she sent the first arrow 
                singing into him from her ashwood bow. A few more arrows and it 
                was over, the gnoll slumping lifelessly to the ground as the plants 
                released their hold. She kenlt down over the body and began to 
                collect the skins and the small amount of cash on the Gnoll, as 
                she heard the group approaching her from behind. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">"M'lady," 
                a voice came, "might we have a moment of your time? We were impressed 
                with the efficiency with which you dispatched this foul beast, 
                and were wondering if you might speak with us for a moment about 
                the bow you carry..." She smiled even as she listened...she was 
                always happy to discuss her craft of fletching and the use of 
                bows, especially when she could smell a sale... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><b>Archery</b> 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In 
                this rambling diatribe, I am going to discuss with you the proper 
                use of bows in the world of Norrath. I will begin with a general 
                discussion, and progress on to more specific information for each 
                class that can use a bow. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">First 
                off, 99% of people out there don't have a clue how to use a bow. 
                I cannot count the number of times I have heard the statement 
                "Bows are only good for one shot before the monster gets to you," 
                or "bows are only good for finishing off monsters that run away." 
                While a bow CAN accomplish these two feats (drawing monsters to 
                you, and finishing them off), it can be used in much more effective 
                ways as well. But the use of a bow requires some qualities lacking 
                in some people...finesse, at least a modicum of intelligence, 
                and a firm grasp of simple tactics. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">When 
                you start using a bow, which you should do as early on as you 
                can, DON'T buy one from a merchant. They do nothing but rip you 
                off. They sell "Hunting" bows for 5gp or so, Shortbows for more 
                than 4pp, and Longbows for nearly 5pp. What a waste. A simple 
                Hickory Recurve bow made by any player with a decent fletching 
                skill has the same range and delay as a Shortbow OR a Hunting 
                Bow, and does TWICE the damage. I sell them for 1pp, and so does 
                everyone I know, unless I have to drag it halfway across the continent, 
                then I sell it for 2pp. Quite a bargain, considering. Longbows 
                SEEM nice because they have a range of 100, but I make Elm bows 
                with a range of 75 and a damage of 13 (as compared to the Longbow's 
                damage of 8) and sell them for 7pp, or a little more if I have 
                to haul them a long ways. Still quite a deal, considering the 
                damage it does. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Anyway, 
                after that, the bows just get better (but more expensive also). 
                You should always carry and use the best bow you think! you can 
                afford. I won't lie to you...the best bows (Oak and Darkwood) 
                run into the hundreds of platinum to make and buy, but these are 
                for high level characters anyway, and they can usually afford 
                them. Besides, like any good weapon, a bow is a one-time purchase 
                until you decide to upgrade, at which time you can usually trade 
                in or sell your old bow and lower the price of your new one. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Arrows 
                are of little consideration in comparison to the bow. Simple 1sp 
                arrows, sold by many merchants, are good enough for most uses. 
                Only the best archers (i.e. higher level) should need different 
                arrows, and they get them from a fletcher, not a merchant. These 
                arrows do more damage at a better range, but cost more as well. 
                Beginners and even most mid-level (10-15) should stick with the 
                basic arrows. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">So 
                now you know bows are expensive, at least the really good ones. 
                So you ask, what good are they? Well, to put it in the simplest 
                possible terms, they are a substitute for the offensive spells 
                that you don't get. Rogues and Warriors never learn spells, and 
                Rangers and Shadowknights have pathetic offensive capabilities 
                as far as magic goes. At 9th level, Rangers get one offensive 
                spell, Flame Lick or Burst of Fire or some other such nonsense. 
                This does about 5 points of damage to the target creature, lowers 
                it's AC a few points, and really ticks it off. Even the spells 
                that Rangers and Shadowknights get at 22nd level are being thrown 
                around by 8th level Druids and Necromancers. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Needless 
                to say, the monsters you will be fighting at 22nd level will be 
                unimpressed with your magic, to say the least. But if you have 
                a bow, on the other hand, things change... Even at 9th level, 
                my ranger was able to dish out 17 damage consistently with her 
                Ash recurve bow and cheap, 1sp arrows. On average, I could get 
                3 shots on a given creature before it got into melee range, and 
                if I used my Snare spell beforehand, that increased to 4 or 5 
                shots! That is up to 85 points of damage BEFORE I had to start 
                swinging a sword. Not bad at 9th level. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">How 
                did I accomplish this? Basic Bow Tactics Those people who only 
                shoot a monster once before melee are one of 3 things: </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">a) 
                Inside an enclosed space, like a dungeon. <br>
                b) Fighting VERY fast monsters. <br>
                c) Stupid. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">After 
                you are done reading this, go fire up your character, look at 
                your keyboard, and press the down-arrow key. I hope that you are 
                not amazed to find that your character moves backwards when you 
                do this. You should know this already. So, the question is, if 
                you can move backwards, and if you can fire arrows at a full run 
                (which you can, unlike spells), why are you shooting an arrow 
                and then standing there, waiting to get attacked? Pick a target, 
                fire an arrow, and start running backwards, firing more arrows. 
                You should get 3 shots on the average monster before melee. And 
                you won't have run that far either. The only bit of thinking this 
                even requires is to look behind you so you don't run off a cliff, 
                into a bandit camp, or the maw of a waiting griffin. That's it. 
                Basic bow tactics. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">You 
                should also know that switiching from firing arrows to melee is 
                as simple as pressing your auto-attack button. No need to switch 
                weapons or anything. And to switch back, say to shoot a fleeing 
                monster, just turn auto-attack off and start shooting. Simple 
                as that. And it just gets better from there. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><b>Warriors 
                and Bows</b> </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">For 
                the Warrior class, a bow is a must have item. They get no spell 
                ability whatsoever, and their role seems to be limited to standing 
                in front, dishing out and recieving damage. While that is all 
                well and good, and indeed a necessary role, all too often I have 
                seen the Warriors of the world run up and start hacking on some 
                monster only to have another spawn next to them or wander by and 
                join in. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Why 
                not draw that monster away from the spawning point, or a bit closer 
                to a safe spot near the guards, by shooting it with a bow first, 
                perhaps even several times, before melee begins? Or better yet, 
                in a group, the Warrior can intitiate the combat by shooting, 
                drawing the monster to the entire group. And if the group contains 
                spellcasters with Root, Grasping Root, or another "hold in place" 
                spell, or better yet, Pets of some sort, then why not just sit 
                back and hammer the poor, helpless creature with arrows while 
                it is held immoble by a spell or fighting some Pet? Play smart. 
                Conserve your hit points. It reduces your horrendous downtime, 
                and allows the casters of your party to conserve their mana for 
                damaging opponents instead of healing you. You will kill more 
                things in less time if you play like this. Isn't that what being 
                a warrior is all about? And if you spend your time alone, wouldn't 
                it be nice to be able to win easily a fight that would have otherwise 
                been very close, all because you spent 3 silver pieces and thwacked 
                3 arrows into a monster before you started hacking on it? </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"><b>Rogues 
                and Bows</b> </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Almost 
                everything I just said about Warriors applies to Rogues too. The 
                only exception is that Rogues rarely stand up front taking all 
                the damage. So what do you do while the monster is Held at a distance 
                by some spell and the rest of the party is blasting away at it? 
                Sneak up to it and Backstab? Depending on the situation, this 
                can be pure suicide. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Suddenly 
                the monster breaks free and turns on YOU, or, worse yet, something 
                even worse wanders by or spawns near the monster and jumps all 
                over you. Backstab is a good way to help a group that is already 
                in melee combat, but you shouldn't have to be the only one who 
                is up there next to the monster. Buy a bow. Sit back a bit. Shoot 
                for a while. Make the easy money. BE A ROGUE. And Rogues have 
                the advantage that, since they don't buy the really expensive 
                armors, and they have a ready source of cash (picking pockets), 
                they can afford the best weapons, including bows. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">A 
                solo Rogue should NEVER be without a bow, just for the versatility 
                it adds. And bows are so much better than any throwing weapon 
                in the game it's almost ridiculous. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The 
                Ranger class (and Shadowknights) is where the use of a bow really 
                comes into it's own. At low levels, you are just like a Warrior, 
                with about the same abilities (You get Kick later, but that's 
                made up for with Tracking and Forage). When you hit 9th level, 
                though, your life can become a lot easier. Go buy the Snare spell 
                and the best bow you can afford. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Go 
                find some soon-to-be-a-corpse monster out in the open somewhere. 
                One that /cons white, or even yellow if you are confident. Look 
                behind you, and make sure there isn't anything dangerous back 
                there. Cast Snare on this hapless being, and start running backwards 
                shooting arrows. After about 5 arrows or so, and hopefully 50-85 
                points of damage, he will catch you. Mop him up in melee combat. 
                Collect your loot. Heal up a little bit. Repeat. Have a friend 
                join in if you want...it's always more fun with friends. And at 
                15th level, it just gets better. You get Grasping Roots, which 
                not only holds the monster still while you rain death down on 
                it, but the spell itself does damage too! What more could you 
                ask for? This works alone or in groups. With Grasping Roots, it 
                even works in enclosed spaces, where there isn't room to run backwards. 
                What a cakewalk. </font></p>

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Shadowknights 
                are actually, in my opinion, the best class to have a bow with. 
                The tactics are EXACTLY the same as for the Ranger, except instead 
                of Snare and Grasping Roots, you get to summon Pets. You don't 
                EVER have to run backwards. Just send the pet after the monster, 
                and rain in arrows on it until your pet or it is dead. If your 
                pet dies first, you should EASILY be able to mop it up in melee. 
                I have never played a Shadowknight, and I don't know how tough 
                pets are, but this tactic seems nearly unbeatable to me. Especially 
                in a group. Especially if that group also has pets and/or Root 
                spells.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">Good 
                grief, why WOULDN'T you carry a bow? You will NEVER get a spell 
                that can dish out damage like a good bow.</font></p>

                <b>Archery skill</b> </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">So, 
                with all this in mind, maybe I have you convinced bows are a good 
                thing. Maybe not. Its just my opinion, but the only GOOD reason 
                for not using a bow is "it doesn't fit with my concept of my character." 
                Role-playing a charcater that feels a bow would be unchivalrous 
                (or whatever) or one who exists only for melee combat is fine. 
                Ignoring the benefits of a bow for any other reason is ignorant. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">In 
                any event, how, you might ask, does one get good with a bow? Well, 
                start early. I made the mistake of letting my bow skill fall behind, 
                now here I am, 11th level, with a 102 (Master) Fletching skill 
                (trade skills are not limited by your level) but struggling to 
                get my Archery skill up to my level maximum. The best way to do 
                this is to go out with the use of the bow as your sole priority. 
                Bring a good supply of cheap arrows, go into the wilderness, and 
                pick on monsters that /con blue to you until your skill is maxed 
                out. Use the tactics discussed above. Even better is to pick on 
                monsters (like Orcs and Gnolls) that /con green to you, so they 
                will run away. Then you can start the combat with a few arrows, 
                and end it with a few more as you follow along behind shooting 
                the hapless creature. Just make sure you don't use this tactic 
                where the beast runs for help (like in BlackBurrow). Out of doors 
                is usually a better choice.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2"> 
                Archery skill is tougher than other combat skills to increase 
                because you end up using it less. You take many more swings in 
                melee than you do shooting, so progress may be slower than normal. 
                But it's fairly cheap, as arrows only cost a silver (or less to 
                those with high charisma) each. And remember to save some money 
                to buy a good bow. Armor and hand weapons are very important, 
                but I hope I have convinced you that having some sort of missile 
                weapon on you is equally as important, or at least can make your 
                career as an adventurer a whole lot easier. </font></p>
