                play on rallos zek and get attacked all the time by mages, yet 
                have not lost a fight to one since lvl 8 back in april &#40;not 
                counting those cheap &#34;attack the guy who just tanked the Hag&#34; 
                kills, have died to a few of those&#41;. Its almost August now, 
                and, though I am only 21 now, I have been attacked numerous times 
                since. My tactics for pvp follow, though they don&#39;t work pve 
                because the mob casters have a much greater spell range, and they 
                seem to have way too much mana, and can are a lot harder to interrupt. 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                ROOT <BR>
                <BR>
                First you have to overcome root, no way around it, if they can 
                root you you are dead. Archery doesn&#39;t help much, unless you 
                have a bow that is insanely fast and never misses so that you 
                can use it to hurt them and interrupt them, but that bow doesn&#39;t 
                exist, all props to the trueshot bow though. Sow has to be cast 
                on you to replace root, so its no use to us until lvl 39. <BR>
                <BR>
                So we have two options, journeyman&#39;s boots, and pumice stones. 
                With Jboots you will never be rooted, so get them as soon as you 
                can. That said I don&#39;t have them yet, and don&#39;t know when 
                or if I will be able to get them. So i use a pumice stone. Pumice 
                stones cost about 20 plat and come with five charges of pilliage 
                enchantment which will be cast on your target, removing buffs 
                and effects from that target, when you right click on the stone 
                &#40;cant be in a bag though&#41;. You can use a pumice stone 
                to get that annoying root off of you. Also you can use a pumice 
                to remove effects from the caster too, take off their bravery, 
                magic skin, or invulnerablity and they should be in a tough spot. 
                Pumice stones can be bought at most potion merchant like the one 
                across from the bank in kelethin. <BR>
                <BR>
                <BR>
                INTERRUPTING AND KILLING <BR>
                <BR>
                Step two after ridding yourself of root is to prevent them from 
                hitting you with spells, and making sure that you hit and kill 
                them first. <BR>
                <BR>
                Root them. If they start to move around while you are fighting 
                you will miss them whenever they get off of your screen...lag 
                adds to this and it can be really annoying. Sometimes they run 
                away and around, only to duck behind you whenever they want to 
                cast forcing you to turn all the way around while they nuke you. 
                So you have to take away their movement, root them. They have 
                two options now, they can either cast cancel magic on themselves 
                or use a pumice. Both work in your favor. If they cast, then they 
                waste mana which is good, if they use a pumice they waste time 
                which is good. Your mana is of no real use to you against them 
                except for root and heals, if they use a pumice then you should 
                be able to hit them a few times in melee and get off another root. 
                Remember they only have five charges on that pumice and you should 
                be able to melee them the whole time that you are rooting-pumicing, 
                thus costing them precious hp&#39;s. <BR>
                <BR>
                If they cast cancel magic on themselves to remove the root, they 
                will waste a lot of mana and you will win. <BR>
                <BR>
                Most likely though they will avoid pumicing or cancel magic-ing 
                themselves and just cast at you. Now you have a few options again: 
                <BR>
                <BR>
                1&#41; straight up melee. Just whack at em, use kick to try and 
                interrupt their spells, and hope that you interrupt a few. Save 
                kick for interrupts, when you see wizznerd begins to cast, kick 
                em. I think your odds on winning this way are not too good, though 
                it can be done. <BR>
                <BR>
                2&#41; back up and heal. this only works above 22, when we get 
                a decent healing spell. But you just simply use your mana to heal 
                yourself while they cast at you. You will lose a lot of hp&#39;s 
                this way, but they will most likely run out of mana after 6 ot 
                7 spells, and you should be able to stay alive from your heals 
                in order to start melee&#39;ing the now mana less mage. Even at 
                half hp you should be able to beat a full hp caster. If this tactic 
                begins to fail switch over to tactic 3 <BR>
                <BR>
                3&#41; run and come back. You can shoot arrows while running, 
                so you should back up out of their casting range, then run back 
                in and hit them a few times with arrows while running towards 
                and then away from them and back out of casting range&#40;should 
                be able to get two or three shots off with a long ranged bow, 
                remember to try and face them always, use mouse look for greater 
                turning speed and run backwards, and get a sow&#41;. Remember 
                to refresh that root occasionally, and vary your timing so they 
                cant pick up a pattern. And if you do get hit by a spell well 
                just stay out of range and heal your self. Remember to keep that 
                root refreshed! This takes a long time to work since you can not 
                continually hit them, and since bows do not do much damage but 
                it can and has worked, though it is only effective in outdoor 
                areas. And once you get them down to about three bubbles you should 
                be able to polish them off with melee. This way takes a lot of 
                time, but hey you might win! <BR>
                <BR>
                4&#41; if they have a pet, then you are in real trouble, but you 
                still have a chance. Root them, and run away get far away so that 
                they can&#39;t see you and the pet, then root the pet and go back 
                to the caster. and start in on them. Run away again when the pet 
                comes back and root it far away again. I only tried this strategy 
                once on a necro and it worked fairly well, but I didn&#39;t kill 
                the necro, he got away from me &#40;broke root and booked&#41; 
                during one of my run the pet far away trips, and I lost him. I 
                don&#39;t think I would have won though, cuz the pet had me down 
                to about 4 bubbles and the necro had a nasty dot on me, and I 
                hadn&#39;t even touched him yet. Truth to tell he may have tried 
                to come after me when I was running the pet around and lost ME. 
                hehe <BR>
                <BR>
                5&#41; in a dungeon duck around corners to avoid spells and strafe 
                out to re-root and shoot them with your bow. You are in trouble 
                in a dungeon though because you cannot go invis to get away, and 
                those mobs love to get involved. If i am in a dungeon i just root 
                the caster and run, I need room to work in and just dont have 
                it inside. <BR>
                <BR>
                But dont fear pc casters, we can beat them every time if we are 
                smart. Use roots, heals, pumice, movement, archery, and our attack 
                skills in any way we can to beat them. Most casters have limited 
                strategies in pvp. They try to root-nuke, but we can beat this 
                easily by turning it back on them with pumice and our own root. 
                now if we could only get around those darn pets, and dot&#39;s. 
                heh <BR>
                <BR>
                More advice for lower levels:</font></font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                You can still pumice their roots off, but if you can&#39;t keep 
                them in one place you will have a hard time with a smart caster, 
                ie one that moves and doesn&#39;t stand still. Problems are-- 
                without dual weild/attack you will find it a lot harder to interrupt, 
                though kick will do it if you can land it. And with only snare 
                you can&#39;t do the root and run out of casting range thing cause 
                they can chase you, albeit slowly. At your level the best thing 
                you can do is try to get up in their face and put some hurt on 
                them, and snare them and then run away and hide when you need 
                to heal...remember they can&#39;t track you, but you can track 
                them. And if things start to go badly, then run my friend, run. 
                snare em and book. Contrary to popular belief though you should 
                not zone, but try to lose them in the environment, and once you 
                have lost them then zone out. PK&#39;s have better computers than 
                you or I &#40;all that plat they can afford em&#41; and will zone 
                faster and get some cheap shots in on you while the server shows 
                you to them and your client still says &#34;loading zone&#34;. 
                And hey, if you&#39;re like me and you hate dying to a pk more 
                than anything, lead them into some mobs. I got attacked while 
                meding in Unrest once, and ran into the house and up the stairs, 
                with the pk following me...I led him into the hag, jumped off 
                the balcony there and got killed by the fall. Lost exp, but kept 
                my pride and took him with me. heh <BR>
                <BR>
                Another thing that I am not sure of--if you are a round a corner 
                in a dungeon they can&#39;t &#34;see&#34; you so they can&#39;t 
                cast on you, anyone know if we can use trees for the same purpose? 
                Could I hide behind a tree to avoid a spell? <BR>
                <BR>
                Best advice that I can give to anyone playing on Rallos Zek though, 
                is thus: do not care about your equipment. Harsh but true; if 
                you care about that tunic too much, then when it gets taken from 
                you, you will be a bit more distraught than you should. And it 
                will get taken from you. Sometime someone will catch you zoning 
                out of a dungeon with no hp&#39;s and nuke you and take something 
                that you valued. And they will most likely be a naked mage with 
                nothing but a bag to stash their loot in so you won&#39;t be able 
                to get it back. <BR>
                <BR>
                If this happens don&#39;t get too upset by it, this is a game 
                that is supposed to be fun, let it be. and let pvp enhance your 
                fun with the extra risk, and extra challenge, not just added frustration. 
                On Rallos Zek most of my pvp experience has been with naked casters 
                who try to attack me in outdoor places far from help. And more 
                often than not I simply pumic myself free, root them, and run. 
                And the above advice does not work very well versus Druids and 
                clerics, who can heal any damage you do to them with your bow. 
                WE CAN TAKE THEM, but it is not easy and once the fight is entered 
                into you cannot back out. That said, my primary adivce on rallos 
                zek is not to enter into pvp with a caster unless you have to. 
                But when you have to, fight dirty and use the game&#39;s mechanics 
                to help you. <br>
                <br>
                Now here is how I see tallon zek complicating things, understanding 
                that on TZ there will be no looting of items, though I am not 
                sure of this. I do know that on the test server you cannot loot 
                items from a pvp kill. I assume then that on TZ there will be 
                no looting. <br>
                <br>
                1&#41; If there is no looting, then the casters won&#39;t be naked. 
                If they are not naked then they could have a lot of &#43;int &#43;wis 
                or &#43;mana stuff on. If that is the case you are in serious 
                trouble. A caster with an additional 20 to 100 mana is going to 
                rock you because they can cast more and more spells on you. Also 
                they will have a higher ac, and higher combat stats from their 
                equip and you will hit for less and hit less often. Good thing 
                though is that you don&#39;t have to fear loosing your stuff, 
                so you should be more free to enter into combat. <br>
                <br>
                2&#41; As a race war server there will be more emphasis on group 
                combat, and less on one-on-one. You cannot fight the same in both 
                environments. If a group attacks you, you won&#39;t even have 
                time to cast root, much less try to use a bow on them all. Best 
                advice here is to run and get your own group. <br>
                <br>
                3&#41; Most of our group combat strategies work on pve, but we 
                will have to develop new ones for group pvp. How do we protect 
                our casters and healers without taunt? How do we get the other 
                team&#39;s wiz to cast at us when they know that our wiz is more 
                dangerous than we are? How do we protect our clerics when they 
                will be the first target of non-tauntable non-lureable pc&#39;s?

                4&#41; How the hell are we going to deal with an 8 lvl limit? 
                How is a lvl 9 ranger supposed to even touch a lvl 17 caster? 
                <br>
                <br>
                So my advice, while I think it's good, mostly works for one-on-one 
                with no one else around in outdoor areas. On Tallon Zek that will 
                be an insignificant portion of pvp. Most often I think you will 
                be engaged in group vs group, and in that case you will have to 
                figure out what to do...I still solo, or group for pve mostly. 
                The two or three times that I have been in group v/s group it 
                has come down to which team had the most healers, and thus the 
                most hitpoints. <br>
                <br>
                I will play on Tallon Zek some, but as a wood elf druid and not 
                as a ranger. I believe that rangers can be effective in pvp combat, 
                but no where near as good as Druids, Shamans, and Clerics. And 
                with every patch Verant ups the power of casters, and screws over 
                melee classes. Root gets its duration increased, casting times 
                go down, damage per DD spell goes up, Dot&#39;s still cause xp 
                loss, and pets can attack you near guards with impunity. And it 
                will not get better. As much as we complain about the classes 
                imbalance in pvp, Verant will get 20 times as many petitions and 
                such from the non-pvp servers for shorter casting times, and higher 
                damages for spells. <br>
                <br>
                I predict that the percentage of melee classes on Tallon Zek will 
                be very low, and even lower after those first few weeks of root-burn 
                combat.</font></font></p>
