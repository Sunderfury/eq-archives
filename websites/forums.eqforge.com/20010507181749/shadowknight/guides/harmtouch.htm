          <td style="border-bottom: 1px double">For starters, Harm Touch is NOT 
            meant to help you kill things you could not normally take out. It 
            is there to help you survive in a situation where things have gotten 
            out of hand, but not extraordinarily so. This said, trying to use 
            HT as a panic button is not the best way of utilizing it; my goal 
            here is to explain some of the strategies I've found that maximize 
            HT's effectiveness.
<p>For the uninitiated, HT is an attack, useable by a shadow knight 
              once per game day, that deals 10 * player level + 1 in damage to 
              the target. i.e. a level 20 shadow knight can HT for 201 damage 
              at maximum. Like all such attacks that deal damage, it is susceptible 
              to being resisted by the target. However, after a great deal of 
              experimentation with HT I have decided that it acts more like a 
              melee attack than a DD spell; your position in relation to the target 
              COUNTS. Also important is timing, which i will get into first:</p>
            <p>The most important part of HT is teaching yourself the proper time 
              to use it. It is a little difficult to explain, you just have to 
              practice on your own and sort of develop an instinct for it. For 
              starters, DON'T PANIC! EverQuest somehow seems to know when you 
              are freaking out and hitting the HT button out of desparation, and 
              you often end up with a resisted spell and an angry critter. You 
              have to stay calm, at least until after you have used it :) If you 
              are hunting in a new area, try using HT on a typical monster while 
              you are in a safe fight (preferably grouped) just to test how much 
              of the target's life is blasted off by your hit. Now you know how 
              weak that particular monster has to be before a harm touch will 
              finish it off. Now, if you get into a fight with too many monsters, 
              you can blast one of them to death as soon as you have melee'd it 
              down enough, and move on to the next. Just remember to only use 
              it as an attack when the situation grows dire; if you can't kill 
              it WITHOUT using harm touch, you shouldn't be fighting it! You are 
              welcome to battle creatures this way, but you are only going to 
              get yourself killed eventually, and probably in a messy way :) In 
              addition to using HT as an attack, it is also one of your most effective 
              taunts. If a group member is being mauled and in dire need of help, 
              you can use your HT to anger the monster and pull it off on you. 
              Just make sure you have enough HP remaining to survive the monster's 
              ire! Using HT as a direct taunt works consistently until around 
              lvl 30 or so, when monsters start getting HP much faster than your 
              HT goes up. At this point, in order to taunt off of your group members, 
              you will need to use other annoyances, such as taunt skill, darkness 
              spells, and disease cloud to get yourself high enough on the monster's 
              hate list for HT to put you over the top.</p>
            <p>When using HT from the target's rear, and especially while it is 
              fleeing or Fear'ed, I can consistently deal full damage on targets 
              that are as many as 10 levels higher than me. This is in contrast 
              to a wizard's direct damage spells, which don't care what direction 
              you face the enemy from, and are virtually impossible to have hit 
              an npc of 6 levels higher for full damage. This does sound like 
              a simple way to use HT, but in combat it can be tricky to get around 
              behind the enemy sometimes. If you are grouped, my suggestion is 
              to lay off the enemy for a moment so that it builds up hate with 
              another group member, allowing you to circle behind it without angering 
              it. Remember to stop taunting and casting spells at this time! :) 
              If you are fighting solo, it can be trickier. Don't count on your 
              pet to hold the target's attention (you AREN'T trying to use it 
              as a tank, are you?); drop a darkness spell on it, cast Fear, and 
              pop it in the back once it starts running. If you are below lvl 
              15 and do not yet have Clinging Darkness and Fear, don't worry; 
              until this point you SHOULD be able to solo without them anyway, 
              if you are doing well :)</p>
            <p>At very high level, the effectiveness of harm touch displays diminishing 
              returns. When your typical monsters have thousands of HP, a few 
              hundred points are not going to count for too much. Don't fret; 
              as a shadow knight, your spells and sword should allow you to drop 
              plenty of damage on your target anyways. It's just that harm touch 
              will become less and less useful, except as a taunt and as a way 
              of eliminating annoying low level casters that may accompany the 
              higher level monsters you want to fight. There really isn't much 
              to reccomend it at very high level, except that having an extra 
              400 to 500 points of damage dealt, instantly, can occasionally save 
              your life. HT can still be a very powerful tool in PvP, however 
              ;)</p>
            <p>A brief note on using HT in PvP situations: many players, especially 
              casters, are not used to having VERY large chunks of their life 
              suddenly blasted off of them all of a sudden. I have seen a wizard 
              suddenly gate out of a duel after bearing the brunt of a HT, even 
              though he knew it was coming, and in my opinion was in a good position 
              to win. In these cases, not only is HT a valuable damage tool in 
              a duel, it is most effective for its psych-out factor. If you can 
              panic your opponent, you can probably win, regardless of your relative 
              levels. Just be careful when fighting a paladin, who can cancel 
              your HT with a timely application of Lay on Hands. You will have 
              to win a game of chicken, wait until they have already used LoH 
              (and hope you have enough HP left) or find some way to keep them 
              from using LoH altogether. I leave that part up to you ;)</p>
            <p>Good luck, now go out there and kill something in the name of Innoruuk!</p>
