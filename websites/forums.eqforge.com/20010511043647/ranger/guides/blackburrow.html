                BlackBurrow “Beacon” </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ok 
                Ranger, you want to go gnoll hunting for a bit eh? Well, you better 
                be at least level 6 if you want to come back out. The first thing 
                about BlackBurrow is the trains. For those who have not heard 
                the term, trains are when more than one gnoll, or any unfriendly, 
                gives chase after a PC. In BlackBurrow, trains are a common site 
                due to the given aspects of this zone. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.The 
                gnolls range from levels 3 up to 16. Some poor sods accidently 
                picks on the wrong gnoll Other gnolls join in and the victim runs 
                for… </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2. 
                ..the nearest zone. There are ONLY 2 zones borders and they are 
                very close to each other. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">3. 
                Last, the zone is very vertically designed and complex. It took 
                me about a dozen visits till I got an idea of where everything 
                is. With gnolls spawning in various spots, and a victim in hysterics 
                because he/she is lost, it doesn’t take much to form a train. 
                So, if you are venturing into this zone at level 6, I’d first 
                recommend taking on the gnolls that lead to BlackBurrow first. 
                One the Qeynos Hills side, take the gnoll that spawns to the right 
                of the cave entrance. If from the Everfrost zone, take on a guard. 
                If you can beat them with relative ease, move on to BlackBurrow. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">6 
                to 10 level strategy: I think the best experience move is to become 
                part of the “Derailment Squad”. Stay near the zone border, mainly 
                the Qeynos Hills border as most trains end here. As the train 
                nears, make sure you don’t see a burly, elite, gaurdsman or commander. 
                If you do, back off! They will make gnoll food of you. Pick one 
                of the gnolls near the end of the train. Feel free to grab one 
                up front if you’re of a higher level and think you can take the 
                heat. If things get bad, run for the border. There are usually 
                others of the squad nearby, so don’t worry too much. If things 
                are quiet, go ahead and pick on the scrawny gnolls that around 
                the top area there. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">11 
                to 14 level strategy: Ok, it should be somewhat safe to roam around 
                a bit. Remember the way out! Learn the caverns bit by bit, and 
                where the nasties spawn. Avoid the elites and commanders as they 
                will use your femurs and tibias to play “Fetch the Stick”. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">15 
                to 18 level strategy: Alright! You’re ready to rock. There are 
                certain area you will want to camp, but be nice and share with 
                others. In the main area, deep in BlackBorrow, there is a ledge 
                that over looks some pools. Single elites spawn there. In a room 
                with two doors, below the ledge, is a stool. Anything from an 
                elite, commander, and shaman appear there. Now in the upper part 
                of the carvens, there are two good spots. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Elite Room has 4-5 elites, and 1 commander that appear. Sometimes 
                a shaman or even a high shaman. This is near the spike pit, and 
                closer to what looks like a small bleacher stand. The entry is 
                very narrow and curves right. Be careful when entering as you 
                may have a full house of elite gnolls. Can you say, “Oops, time 
                for a new train.”? In a little further to the caverns from the 
                spike pit, on the left hand side, is a set of 3 alcoves. Two commanders 
                tend to spawn here with an elite and gaurdsman. Good fighting 
                here too. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Even 
                at level 18, when a train of elites and commanders is on me, I’m 
                deadmeat for the most part. All you can do is run for the top 
                and zone. But, here’s what I do to help distance myself from the 
                train when I’m near the Elite Room… </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Sy’s 
                Escape: When suddenly realizing in the Elite Room or the Commanders’ 
                Alcoves, “Oops”, I’ve found an escape that seems to work 100% 
                of the time. From the Elite Room, run along the left wall till 
                you reach the Commanders’ Alcove. Don’t run into the alcove, you’re 
                in enough trouble already! Instead of a left into the alcove, 
                AND instead of going through the door ahead, make a right. You’ll 
                wind up shortly at another door with a gaurdsman near it. Open 
                it and jump off the ledge! Weeee, about a 100ft drop into the 
                water. Swim to the only water level exit, and, congrats, the gnolls 
                do not jump in after you. Still, don’t stop moving as they are 
                up top looking for a way down other than jumping. But, you’re 
                already ½ way home. From the water level exit, cross the short 
                bridge to the door, do NOT go through the door. Make a right and 
                follow the shore line. You’ll soon recognize the way up to the 
                top from there. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now 
                if I remember right, by the time you make it the zone from the 
                Elite Room, you may have 4 elites, 1 commander, 5 gaurdsmen, 8 
                regular gnolls, 6 scrawny, and a gnoll pup on your case. This 
                depends on your level – the higher your level, the lesser gnolls 
                leave you alone. Otherwise, 25 gnolls after one prey! This will 
                surprise the Derailement Squad!!! </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">That’s 
                about it. Some good experience and some decent loot, but no unique 
                loot that I’m aware of. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Good 
                luck and happy hunting, </font></p>
