              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hello 
                fellow Rangers, </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I thought 
                I would send out across the land a recounting of my adventures 
                in making the Trueshot bows that I now possess and use proudly 
                in the defense of the lands of Norrath.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> First 
                off, I should let it be known that I had tried the quest for the 
                Trueshot Bow many seasons ago to no avail. I later learned from 
                a wise old sage that my failure was due to the fact that I was 
                not of sufficient skill level in my chosen trade of fletching. 
                Now that I am a master fletcher, of skill level 163, I decided 
                to again attempt to make the much sought after Trueshot bow. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
                do this quest one must have the 4 main ingredients, Treant Wood, 
                Dwarven Wire, Micro Servos and Spiderling Silk. These ingredients, 
                when combined in the correct proportions, will yield you a single 
                shaft of treant wood suitable for the making of a single bow. 
                But, just aquiring the four ingredients is not sufficient. The 
                gods of norrath must smile on you. And once you atain the shaft 
                of Treant Wood the gods must smile on you a second time, and it 
                is usually this second time that is the most difficult time. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Upon 
                aquiring the four ingredients in large quantities, for I wished 
                to help my fellow rangers by making them bows and also lining 
                my pockets with platinum, I proceded to Kelethin. One must be 
                in Kelethin because it is there where the four ingredients are 
                combined and turned over to the Ranger’s Guild leader. Since the 
                gods forbid a single fletcher from possessing more than one shaft 
                of the wood of the Treant at any one time, one needs to be near 
                the Rangers Guild of Kelethin for repeated attempts. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 
                one successfully combines the four ingredients and turns them 
                over to the head of the ranger's guild you are rewarded with experience, 
                gold and the afore mentioned shaft of treant wood suitable for 
                bow making. You then need to inquire and learn the steps and ingredients 
                that are needed to transform the shaft of treant wood into the 
                Trueshot Bow. To divulge those instructions outside of the realm 
                of the Rangers Guild would be sacreligious act so I only warn 
                you to seek and heed those instructions. And remember that you 
                are only permited by the gods to possess a single shaft of treant 
                wood at any one time. And the gods know where you bank. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
                after spending almost 13 platinum for one of the additional items 
                needed to convert the shaft of treant wood to a trueshot bow, 
                I placed the 4 items into my fletchers kit, all the while hoping 
                that the gods of norath would smile on me. I closed the case only 
                to be dissappointed by the message that "You are of unsufficient 
                skill to create the famed Trueshot bow". Knowing that more tries 
                might fulfil my desires to possess the Trueshot bow, I repeated 
                the process of aquiring another shaft of treant wood, and placed 
                it, along with the additional 3 items, into my fletching kit. 
                Failure again, and again and again. But on the 5th attempt I was 
                rewarded with a beautiful Trueshot Bow. A bow that is both sleak 
                of line and bold in its power to smite the wicked creatures of 
                the land of Norrath. As a weapon, it is ranked high, with its 
                damage of 20 and delay of only 45 and range of 100. As a piece 
                of hand crafted artwork it is unsurpassed in beauty. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I then 
                proceded to roam the area of my birth cleansing the land of the 
                dreaded orcs, goblins and other creatures that have harrarassed 
                my people these many long years. The Trueshot Bow is a mighty 
                weapon and it served me so well that I decided to try and make 
                a second one so that a fellow ranger could also use it to rid 
                this beautiful land of those ugly and hideous orcs and goblins. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I handed 
                my Trueshot bow over to my squire and proceded to make another 
                one. After laying down my 13 platinum and making 4 additional 
                attempts I was rewarded with another Trueshot bow. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now 
                as I sit and ponder my future I await the presence of another 
                ranger who will become the owner of this second Trueshot Bow and 
                become an additional warrior in the battle to save our land from 
                the scourge of the orcs, goblins and other creatures. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
                an end to my tale I remind all fletchers who would attempt the 
                making of a trueshot bow, you may only possess a single shaft 
                of treant wood at any one time and you may only possess one of 
                the trueshot bows at any one time. But this mighty bow is a powerful 
                tool well worth the price you may pay a skilled fletcher for it 
                or well worth the sweat and effort to create one of your very 
                own. </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fare 
                well and good luck in your travels and hunting, </font></p>
