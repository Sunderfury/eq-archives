                </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Sitting on 
                the wall of Misty Thicket watching the mist that it is named for 
                swirling slightly in the breeze. I am safe in the knowledge that 
                nothing can hurt me here. I begin to think about new places to 
                visit and new enemies to hunt. The last few months have provided 
                great times, ridding the Thicket of the Crushbone orcs and earning 
                my squad ring has provided me with many pleasant, and some not 
                so pleasant memories. Unconsciously I twist the hard-earned ring 
                on my finger and run my hand over the scar on the back of my hand. 
                A present from one orc who didn’t like the bite of my sword. A 
                small price to pay I muse.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My thoughts are interrupted 
                by a prickling sensation just behind my eyes, signally someone 
                wishes to get in contact with me. I concentrate and hear my friend 
                Endareth’s voice, &quot;Hail fellow Keeper!&quot; he says, &quot;Come 
                join me in Lavastorm!&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">How fitting I think, 
                a new hunting ground just when I needed it</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Hail Keeper&quot; 
                I say, &quot;I will meet you there&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Shaking myself out 
                of my riviere I pick up my two handed sword and sling it across 
                my back and start jogging towards Rivervale. Stopping only once 
                to heal and buff a halfling newbie.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Once I hit the Commonlands 
                I begin to realize how hot the sun can be as sweat begins to trickle 
                down the side of my face. In the Thicket the mist keeps most of 
                the heat away. I stop for refreshments at a small village keeping 
                a sharp eye out for a nasty dark elf called Gix. Too many times 
                I have nursed wounds from his hands. One day he will pay.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I continue to the 
                entrance of the Nektulos Forest stopping only to recast my protective 
                spells. Upon entering the forest I, immediately get a sense of 
                foreboding. A cold chill runs down my spine making me shiver.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;What is this 
                place?&quot; I ask Endareth who has come to guide me to Lavastorm</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Dark Elf Territory&quot;, 
                he says, a dangerous glow in his eyes &quot;Watch your back&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Another chill runs 
                through my body as I consider what he is saying, this is dangerous 
                territory for a Wood Elf, Dark Elves lust after my blood.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Lets go&quot;, 
                I say, &quot;The sooner we leave this place the better&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Endareth nods and 
                begins to murmur the words for Spirit of Wolf and Invisibility, 
                I chuckle and once again thank my lucky stars for a friend with 
                such power; nothing will hurt me now!<br>
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ah, to become complacent 
                is the worst possible think I could have done. Being ignorant 
                of this forest I do not realize the Stone Guardians that patrol 
                the forest can see through the Invisible spell. Being curious 
                of these creatures I get closer to this strange looking beast, 
                Almost before I realise it, he has turned and seen me. He charges 
                towards me and gives me a stunning blow to my head, cancelling 
                my invisibility. While trying to clear my head he hits me again, 
                just under the ribcage. I hear a sickening crunch and I lose my 
                breath. Somehow I manage to gather my senses and start running, 
                luckily they are slow creatures and I manage to escape another 
                blow, but I am visible now and very nervous.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I keep running towards 
                Lavastorm, keeping a sharp eye out, my breath is coming in ragged 
                gasps and every time I take a breath a sharp pain shoots though 
                my chest. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Up ahead I see the 
                entrance to Lavastorm Mountains, hope for respite surges through 
                me. Just when I think I'm safe, Dragoon T’Sane jumps from behind 
                a rock. &quot;Wood Elves Die!&quot; he screams. Weary from my 
                run, bleeding from the wound on my head and pain shooting through 
                me from every breath, I desperately run to the gate of Lavastorm.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Too late I hear the 
                whistle of a sword cutting the air. I scream in agony, indescribably 
                pain shooting through my head, but not for long. I sink to my 
                knees, darkness surrounds me, the last sounds I hear is the victory 
                cry from T’sane.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When I awaken I am 
                in Rivervale, a long run from Lavastorm, Endareth contacts me 
                &quot;Sethra! Are you ok?&quot; I bite back a sarcastic remark, 
                knowing it’s the stress. &quot;No&quot;, I reply, &quot;I died.&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I once again start 
                jogging back to Nektulos Forest, jumping at every crack of a twig. 
                I am without weapons or amour and still feeling the after effects 
                of my reincarnation. To add to my nervous state, I wander too 
                close to a Skeleton camp, something I would never do if I was 
                in a normal state, and a dread corpse chases me to the Forest 
                entrance.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Once I enter the 
                forest I sit and catch my breath, my heart is beating so loud 
                I’m sure everyone can hear it. I must calm myself before moving, 
                fear is my worst enemy.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Again I make my way 
                to Lavastorm staying high on the edge of the mountains, out of 
                sight of the enemies on the ground. I reach Lavastorm and see 
                my mangled corpse lying on the ground. Anger surges through me… 
                later I tell myself. I start begin to retrieve my belongings. 
                Out of the corner of my eye I see movement. A guard; I heave a 
                sigh of relief, I can retrieve my belongings in safety. I continue 
                to gather my things when the sound of running feet makes me look 
                up.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The guard is running 
                towards me, with bloodlust in his eye, my blood. Oh god not again, 
                I think. My heart in my mouth I drop my things and run towards 
                the Lavastorm gate. Pain shoots through my side as the guard finds 
                his mark, and again through my leg as he opens a deep cut, his 
                sword scraping my bone. Half walking half crawling I stumble across 
                the gate, the guard screams in anger, he can go no further.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I stumble to the 
                ground, exhausted. I am alive but only just. I quietly sob to 
                myself, my body, cut and broken. It will be days before I recover 
                enough to retrieve my belongings, Gingerly I lay myself down on 
                the warm earth and sleep. Dreaming of revenge</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">--Sethra</font></p>
