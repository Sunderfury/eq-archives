              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                In my 16th level of existence, I got a call from a friend to help 
                her dispatch some particularly vulgar gnolls named Reavers who 
                were defiling the Eastern Plains of Karana. So I put down my halfling 
                pie, and starting a quick jog out to the plains, necessarily calling 
                upon my woodcraft skills to blend flawlessly into the surrounding 
                through the perilous Gorge of King Xorbb. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In 
                a few moments, I had joined her, along with her brother and another 
                friend, and we began to decimate the reaver population including 
                some of a very disturbing undead variety who filled us with a 
                sense of horror just looking at them. Her brother was called away 
                shortly and the three of us kept the pace. But then I saw a powerful 
                creature i had previously known only from horror stories fly by 
                on giant wings, a Griffawn. I considered it and, since it appeared 
                to be an even fight, asked my companions if we shouldnt try to 
                kill it. And received a resounding chorus of NO's! </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">By 
                the next week, I had become experienced enough to make the journey 
                back to Surefall Glade and learn the art of Duel Wielding from 
                Master Hagar Sureshot. Then I returned to HighHold Pass, but after 
                seeing that there were many more adventures than gnolls to kill, 
                I returned to Eastern Karana. After a bit of practicing with using 
                both my barbed whip and my Dwarven Axe simultaneously, I happened 
                to see the griffawn fly past once more. The beast considered blue 
                so I decided it was time to try my luck despite the warnings from 
                my much wiser friends. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                drew its attention with a burst of fire, but suddenly found myself 
                under a barrage of powerful hits. After a few moments of trying 
                desperately to fend them off a conceded defeat and ensnared the 
                creature while i attempted to make it pass the boundries of the 
                Plain. But in my vastly weakened condition it quickly overtook 
                me and buried its beak into my spine with one last horrible thrust. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When 
                I awakened in Rivervale, even the joyous singing of the halflings 
                could not drive thoughts of revenge from my mind. So I called 
                upon a friend from hunts past, a noble halfling warrior of the 
                19th level, and together we trekked back to East Karana. After 
                recovering my belongings, I quickly caught the whiff of the creature 
                on the air. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Feeling 
                confident in our power, we charged the beast and began to pummel 
                it with whip, axe, and halberd. Perhaps weakened by overconfidence, 
                we began to take brutal wounds fromt he powerful animal. We were 
                both nearing the end of our strength when I saw the end end was 
                pulling nigh, and not a very pleasant one at that. With a last 
                desperate effort I threw all the fire I could summon at the beast. 
                Enraged and wounded, it turned on me and knocked me to the ground 
                with one mighty blow. After a time of laying on the ground, bleeding 
                profusely, I regained consciousness through Karanas blessing. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                I rose to my knees, with the head in my hands and my weapons scattered 
                before me, I saw the corpse of the griff laying next to a small 
                halfling, alive, but so weakened that he could not even move over 
                to loot the monster. As I sat to regain thought through meditation, 
                he told me that after seeing me fall, and assuming me dead, he 
                went into a berserker frenzy and managed to drive home the winning 
                blow with only 5 pieces of his strength remaining to him. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Although 
                our efforts were rewarded with but 5 gold pieces and it took us 
                well into the night to recover from vast injuries, we walked away 
                with a great sense of pride and honor that could never be gained 
                from slaying snakes and rats. My last rational thoguht before 
                falling into an exhausted slumber that night was to bemoan the 
                lack of a good ale or wine to be found in Rivervale. </font></p>
