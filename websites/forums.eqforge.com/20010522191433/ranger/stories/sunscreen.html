              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ladies 
                and gentlemen of the class of 2000: Play EverQuest. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
                I could offer you only one tip for the future, getting an OC-3 
                fiber optic connect to your gaming rig would be it. The long-term 
                benefits of fiber optic speed have been proved by LPBs everywhere, 
                whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than 
                my own lag filled experience. I will dispense this advice now. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Enjoy 
                the power and speed of your computer. Oh, never mind. You will 
                not understand the power and speed of your computer until you've 
                tried to play Darklands on a 486-50. But trust me, in 20 years, 
                you'll look back at screenshots of yourself and recall in a way 
                you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Don't 
                worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as 
                effective as trying to take on a hill giant at level 6 with a 
                rusty dagger and rabies. The real troubles in your life are apt 
                to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the 50% packetloss 
                that blindsides you at 9 p.m. on some Thursday while you're running 
                from a gorge hound in East Karana. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Do 
                one thing every day that scares your party members. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Spam. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Don't 
                be reckless with other party member's lives. Don't put up with 
                party members that are reckless with yours. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Play 
                all day. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Don't 
                waste your time on ping envy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes 
                you're behind. The game is long and in the end what matters is 
                the satisfied grin on your teammates faces while you're sitting 
                around the campfire roasting a lion patriarch steak. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Forget 
                all the times your spells fizzled. Remember the times you killed 
                that wisp with your last spell. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Keep 
                your old demos. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Throw 
                away your old Voodoo1. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Don't 
                respawn camp. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Don't 
                feel guilty if you end up on the wrong end of a Blackburrow train 
                and spam to keep alive. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Get 
                plenty of armor. Be kind to your knees. You'll miss them when 
                they're hacked off. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Maybe 
                you're a powergamer, maybe you aren't. Maybe you like to PK, maybe 
                you don't. Maybe you'll divorce at 40 because your wife thinks 
                you play too many video games, maybe you'll both be playing Team 
                Fortress Classic on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you 
                do, don't take losing too seriously, or winning either. Your defense 
                was probably be half assed. So was your offense. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Get 
                to know your cleric. You never know who she might heal when both 
                of the tanks have gone under two bubbles. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Do 
                not suffer from level envy. That 38th level wizard is probably 
                only 15 years old and on summer vacation. Plus he has acne. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Talk 
                to people while you fish. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Understand 
                that guilds come and go, but only a respectable few live on in 
                memory. Work hard to bridge the gaps between servers, because 
                the older you get, the more you'll miss the people who hunted 
                with you when you were young. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Play 
                in the Arena once, but leave before it makes you hard. Go hunt 
                wisps on Erud's crossing once, but leave before it makes you soft. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Use 
                hotkeys. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Accept 
                certain inalienable truths: Pings will drop. People will steal 
                kills. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize 
                that when you were young, pings sucked, guilds were noble and 
                everyone played nice. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Respect 
                your leaders. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Don't 
                expect anyone to heal you. Maybe you have a good cleric. Maybe 
                you'll have a kick ass monk. But you never know when either one 
                might piss off a griffon. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Save 
                newbies. Don't kill monsters that con green to you. But remember 
                that they might con red to someone else. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Be 
                suspicious about the little moving shape on the horizon, but be 
                patient with the <b>ranger</b> who takes you on a 5 minute detour 
                around it. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Leaving 
                corpses unlooted are a form of territorial pissing. Picking up 
                loot off a monster someone left is a way of fishing money from 
                the disposal, wiping off the blood, painting over the ugly parts 
                and recycling it for more than it's worth. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">But 
                trust me on the OC-3 fiber optic connect. </font></p>
