    <i>You say, 'What prophecy?'</i><br>
    <b>Marl Kastane says 'I suppose it is time for the secret to be shared.
    Ages ago, two brothers were born. Glohnor was highly favored by the pompous
    Lightbringer, whose name we do not utter. Lhranc was chosen by the Prince
    of Hate to bring destruction and turmoil to the sons of men. The one thing
    they shared in common was their love of the fair priestess, Kyrenna.
    Kyrenna fell deeply in love with Glohnor. When Lhranc discovered this, he
    was overcome with rage and unwisely attacked his brother, who happened to
    be far more adept in combat. The fight cost Lhranc dearly. He lost his
    dignity as well as an eye in the struggle. He was ordered to leave Freeport
    and live his life in exile from the only home he had ever known.</b><br>
    <br>
    <i>You say, 'What became of Lhranc?'</i><br>
    <b>Marl Kastane says 'Lhranc wandered the deserts of Ro for weeks, sinking
    deeper into depression and giving in to rage. Reports from the local
    merchants and caravans had him roaming the dunes muttering to himself
    incoherently. Eventually, he was forgotten, blending in with the hermits and
    madmen common to that region, forgotten by all save one.</b><br>
    <br>
    <i>You say, 'Who is the one?'</i><br>
    <b>Marl Kastane says 'Innoruuk had not forsaken Lhranc. Once his rage and
    hate had matured and sufficiently altered his soul, the dark prince
    summoned him and gave him dominion over the demons that had enslaved his
    mind. He was given a weapon that made him powerful enough to slay any enemy
    that stood in his way. He was to become the first human to harness the
    power of the almighty shadowknight. After years of traveling and teaching
    mankind his newfound abilities, Lhranc sneaked back into Freeport through a
    series of sewers in search of revenge against his brother and in hopes of
    kidnapping Kyrenna, the source of his obsession. Waiting until Glohnor was
    alone, Lhranc sprang from the shadows and slew his brother. This was the
    act that brought about his curse.</b><br>
    <br>
    <i>You say, 'What curse?'</i><br>
    <b>Marl Kastane says 'As I said, Glohnor was highly favored by the
    Lightbringer. When the contemptible god of honor discovered what had been
    done, he transformed Lhranc into a deformed spectral knight and placed him
    in the ruined city. Lhranc then used what remained of his power to summon
    Kyrenna to his side and bind her there in a timeless, seamless sphere. He
    struggled for centuries to break her will and convince her to serve
    Innoruuk, certain that together they could remove his curse. But then,
    there was the prediction.</b><br>
    <br>
    <i>You say, 'What prediction?'</i><br>
    <b>Marl Kastane says 'The prophecy states that one day Kyrenna will escape
    the clutches of Lhranc and that she will resurrect Glohnor. Together, it
    reads, they will destroy Lhranc and undo all he has done. I trust that I do
    not need to tell you, <i>{Your name}</i> , that this would decimate our
    foothold in Norrath. When the prophecy was written, its words spread across
    the land. A dark council was held to construct a plan that would frustrate
    the words of the prophets. My ancestors were responsible for robbing
    Glohnor's tomb and securing his remains. For generations we have been
    charged with the duty of guarding those remains and the secret plan, should
    the corpse be discovered.</b><br>
    <br>
    <i>You say, 'What secret plan?'</i><br>
    <b>Marl Kastane says 'The plan is a last resort only to be tried if Kyrenna
    indeed escapes and the remains are discovered. Judging by my brother's
    words that time is now. It will take the most powerful hero all the courage
    and dedication he can muster to complete the ritual.</b><br>
