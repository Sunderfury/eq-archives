            Warrior and part Necromancer. Most people say 1/4th Necro and 3/4th 
            Warrior, but this varies between the races. Obviously, Humans and 
            Dark Elves with their lower strength will try to make up for it with 
            their greater mana. Without getting into a debate about the best race 
            for a Shadow Knight, I will present each level of spells through 39 
            from my 44th level Dark Elf Xilith&#146;s point of view, in most cases
						the text was written at the time I first got the spell, and any addendums
						are in italics.
            <p> </p>
            <p><font size="3" color="#669933"><b>Rank 1 &#150; Level 9 (mostly 
              level 1 Necro spells)</b></font></p>
            <p>Finally, you have spells! One nice thing about hybrids is the spells 
              are always cheap relative to a caster. You must remember to train 
              in your magic skills. There are 5 different schools of magic: Abjuration, 
              Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, and Evocation. In addition, 
              you should train in Channeling, which will allow you to cast faster, 
              and resist interruption. This is extremely important to an SK since 
              they almost always cast in combat and get hit in the middle. At 
              level 26 I am able to recover quite often and get that spell off. 
              At this rank, you only get Alteration, Conjuration, and Divination 
              spells, so you might consider waiting to train Abjuration and Evocation 
              (First Evocation spell is at 22nd level &#150; Ward Undead). After 
              you have trained in the magical arts, you must purchase your spells 
              and scribe them. Since you don&#146;t yet have Meditate, this can 
              be a tedious process, but it will get better at 12th level. At this 
              level, you won&#146;t find magic to be of that much assistance, 
              but you will get used to having 10 higher strength constantly.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Disease Cloud:</font></b> Diseases the 
              target and hits for 5 damage. The best use I have found for this 
              spell is that at lower levels it can be quite a taunt. I found monsters 
              would stay on me more and off my wizard if I threw a disease in 
              between swings every now and then. I still have it memorized, and 
              use it on really long fights and while kiting to prevent mobs from 
              healing. </p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Invisibility to Undead:</font></b> At 
              this level, only useful to avoid wandering undead, can make the 
              run up from South Ro much easier. In a few levels, it is really 
              good in Befallen, and again later when pulling from the house in 
              Unrest. I don&#146;t regularly keep it memorized unless I&#146;m 
              in Unrest. Remember, you can cast this one on others too. Mana cost 
              is really high for this level.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Leering Corpse:</font></b> Your first 
              pet, it should be level 4+. Pets are the subject of much debate 
              for SK&#146;s. I&#146;m doing an article on using pets soon as well. 
              I don&#146;t remember using my pet much at this level. Troll and 
              Ogre SK&#146;s may not be able to summon a pet when they first get 
              this spell due to the high mana cost.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Lifetap:</font></b> As this spell was added
						after I turned level 30, I have never used it in context.  As all of
						our pre-expansion lifetaps, it requires double the mana listed.  Our
						three lifetap spells are most useful decreasing downtime by sucking 
						hp from low greens, or from neighboring group's pulls.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Locate Corpse: </font></b>This will target 
              the nearest corpse, and turn you towards it. If you target a player, 
              it will turn you towards their corpse and target it. Obvious use 
              is to find your corpse, or if it&#146;s not lost, to plot a straight 
              line to it. Another use is when a monster dies inside a tree or 
              wall. Clear your target and cast this spell, and it will target 
              the corpse. Then use the /loot command to loot it.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Sense the Dead:</font></b> Targets the 
              nearest undead, and turns you toward it. This can be a problem in 
              zones with a lot of SK&#146;s and Necro&#146;s, such as Nektrulos, 
              as it will target pets as well. Useful at this level to find things 
              to fight. Might allow to find pet if pet is targeted</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Siphon Strength:</font></b> Steals 10 
              strength from target and gives it to you. I have had this spell 
              memmed ever since I bought it, and rely on it to remain unencumbered 
              (weak DE remember?), and to get a little extra damage. Low mana 
              cost, so you can cast it on everything you fight as a cheap debuff, 
              or to pull. In my eyes, one of our best spells.  <I>As of a recent
							patch, this now stacks with all other strength buffs, increasing it's
							value in group situations</I></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><font color="#669933"><b><font size="3">Rank 2 &#150; Level 15 
              (mostly level 4 Necro spells)</font></b></font></p>
            <p>At this level, you will see your spells start to make a larger 
              difference in the way you play, and you will find yourself much 
              more effective at each new rank. If you haven&#146;t already, train 
              in Abjuration for Numb the Dead and Endure Cold.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Bone Walk:</font></b> A new pet, about 
              level 8. Much more useful than the last one. Read my guide on pets 
              for some tips at this level.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Clinging Darkness: </font></b>The darkness 
              line is one of our best set of spells. I always had it memorized 
              until I got Engulfing Darkness at level 22. Although not much damage 
              (25-30 points), it will slow the mob down considerably, allowing 
              you to run, or prevent them from running. A great spell to pull 
              with, and/or cast on a monster before it will run. A mob near death 
              will turn its back to you and stand there, waiting for you to finish 
              it off. I love that, and my party too. After the last patch, however, 
              it will not stack with root, so coordinate with your rooters, as 
              this is better in my opinion, and saves them some mana. See Fear 
              below for some interesting combos.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Endure Cold:</font></b> Useful when fighting 
              shamen such as orcs, goblins, and gnolls in High Pass, or in Befallen 
              to help against Ice Boned Skeletons. Also useful later on when fighting 
              higher wizzes that use cold based attacks. You can keep your group 
              buffed with this to save a shaman or other buffer some mana.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Fear:</font></b> This spell has a few 
              uses, and can get you into trouble as well. You can cast it on a 
              mob in a camp to pull the others, and not have to fight him until 
              he returns. You can also slow a mob with a darkness spell, and then 
              fear it while you and your pet or party beat on it. I used this 
              to solo blues in South Karanas a little after 22nd level with Engulfing 
              Darkness. You have to watch out, though, because feared monsters 
              can and will bring back friends when it wears off. Also great in 
              PvP or duels, either using the above tactic or, in dangerous zones, 
              to get them killed by falling or lava. Another use is to fear something 
              to let you run away from it. Due to the long casting time, difficult 
              to get off while getting hit. I usually pull with darkness, then 
              send my pet to intercept, and cast fear while he takes a few hits.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Lifespike:</font></b> As this spell was added
						after I turned level 30, I have never used it in context.  As all of
						our pre-expansion lifetaps, it requires double the mana listed.  Our
						three lifetap spells are most useful decreasing downtime by sucking 
						hp from low greens, or from neighboring group's pulls.</p>
            <p><strike><b><font color="#333366">Mend Bones: </font></b>You can heal your 
              pet, or some other Necro/SK&#146;s pet with this. Doesn&#146;t heal 
              very much, though, but I generally have enough mana to burn as a 
              DE. I used this in Oasis at levels 15-17 to let my pet tank while 
              I stepped in to take swings with a high damage, high delay weapon 
              (Shiny Brass Halberd I believe) Read my pet guide for more info 
              on this.</strike><font color="red">This spell was removed and replaced
							with Lifespike.</font></p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Numb the Dead: </font></b>Used like lull, 
              but undead. Useful for pulling part of an undead camp. I only used 
              this while camping skeletons in Rathe Mts, but might be useful to 
              get you out of Befallen or Unrest as well.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Shadow Step:</font></b> This spell casts 
              really, really fast, maybe in a sec. Useful in a duel or PvP to 
              confuse your advisary or to get a headstart on a mob/player while 
              fleeing. It can disorient you, too, so watch out.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><font color="#000033"><b><font size="3" color="#669933">Rank 3 
              &#150; Level 22 (mostly level 8 Necro Spells)</font></b></font></p>
            <p>This is a good time for SK&#146;s. You&#146;ve just had your damage 
              cap removed, an improved regeneration rate, and now have double 
              attack. By now you have a good weapon, and your pet can no longer 
              hold a monsters attention if you are in melee with it.. The best 
              spell at this level is Engulfing Darkness, and improvement to Clinging 
              Darkness that will dish out about 100 points of damage in addition 
              to the slowing effect you&#146;ve come to love. You will need to 
              train Evocation if you haven&#146;t yet, and will find it hard to 
              improve since you have just got your first Evoc spell, Ward Undead.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Convoke Shadow:</font></b> About level 
              12 pet. It can now dish out more damage, but is only good for a 
              few hits, so don&#146;t let it tank except to get off a spell. Still, 
              pets can be a good DOT. Useful for the darkness/fear combo described 
              above.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Dark Empathy:</font></b> Trades about 
              20 hp from yourself to the target. For Trolls this can be really 
              useful to even out the hit points of the tanks. At this level, you 
              won&#146;t save many lives with it, so mainly useful after combat. 
              One trick, if you are already hurt to or below half and can bandage 
              well, is to cast on other wounded player(s) that are above half 
              and then bandage yourself. Useful if you can&#146;t rest long, and 
              the other player can tank the next fight since you will be left 
              at half.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Deadeye: </font></b>See invisible. Great 
              on PvP servers to avoid a surprise, or to save a mage casting see 
              invis on you before following him invisibly.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Engulfing Darkness: </font></b>Did I mention 
              I love this line of spells? Better damage, but used the same. Good 
              for about 100 points. You can just about kite with this on blues.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Spook the Dead:</font></b> This spell is
						incredible when soloing undead such as Giant Skeletons in Rathe Mts. 
						and Spectres in Oasis and Feerott.  It casts fast, and takes virtually
						no mana, allowing you to fear kite undead much more effictiently than
						if you had to use fear.  You can even survive bad solo pulls by fearing
						away the extras and pulling your target out of their aggro range, although
						neighboring hunters may not approve of this.</p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Vampiric Embrace: </font></b>Another point 
              of argument. Most likely due to the fact that often SK&#146;s use 
              slow 2H slashing weapons that don&#146;t give much of a chance to 
              do the embrace. Also, has a short duration (about the length of 
              an average fight). At level 22 it will steal 13 health, and it goes 
              up one point for every two levels. A high DEX will help it to go 
              off more in combat. I&#146;ve had it go off 4 times in a fight, 
              and I&#146;ve had it go off none, but it&#146;s better than nothing, 
              so I try to cast before a pull or respawn. I&#146;d be interested 
              in hearing from someone using a really low delay weapon to see how 
              often they get it to work. Contrary to what Necro&#146;s may tell 
              you, this spell HAS been changed to work with or without a weapon.
							<I>I still have this memorized at level 44.  I cast it whenever the
							puller says "Inc" or before i go off to pull.  The damage scales up
							to 26 at level 50, and since you cast it before combat, you might
							as well.  All in all a good spell.</I></p>
            <p><b><font color="#333366">Ward Undead:</font><font color="#99CC66"> 
              </font></b>Does about 41 damage to undead. Not very much you say? 
              But if you use a high delay weapon like I do, you can cast in between 
              swings and it starts stacking up. You can also fall back and attack 
              from afar with this if you get seriously hurt. Here&#146;s a trick 
              to get your Evocation up to par&#133; Summon a pet, target it, and 
              cast this repeatedly. You will fizzle a lot at first, but you will 
              improve, even though your pet is unaffected. I did this while camping 
              a slow spawn and got it up 60 points in one night.</p>
							
            <p><font color="#000033"><b><font size="3" color="#669933">
						Rank 4 - Level 30 (mostly level 12 Necro Spells)</font></b></font></p>
						<p>This is another "good" level.  You get Riposte and a new rank of spells,
						and if you are really lucky, that Dark Reaver you shrewdly traded for will
						start stealing strength.  With the addition of Heat Blood, you can solo
						blues much more easily now.</p>  

						<p><b><font color="#333366">Endure Disease:</font></b>
						I don't seem to catch many diseases nowadays, but you never know.
						Maybe use when fighting necros and shamen. <I>Added later, this spell
						is useful in Kithicor, although you will get diseased eventually anyway.
						Other useful situations include Sol B fighting bugs, and in the Plane
						of Hate, if you cannot get Resist Disease cast on you.</I></p>  

						<p><b><font color="#333366">Feign Death:</font></b>
						Now I know why all those other SKs were constantly casting Endure Cold.
						You'll want to have a high Abjuration skill from now on, so if it is
						lagging behind, spend some time casting Endure Cold on anyone you see.
						This spell is great.  You cast, fall to the ground, and mobs just walk
						away, forgetting you ever swung.  That is, unless you have a DOT on them,
						in which case they just aren't fooled, so keep that in mind.  Also, when
						you want to get up, click on the "Sit" button once to get up. <I>This 
						spell keeps getting nerfed because of exploiting necros... I will be
						adding a guide specific to Feign Death tactics soon.</I></p>

						<p><b><font color="#333366">Gather Shadows:</font></b>  Invisibility,
						just a little later than you needed it.  Still, it's great for corpse
						retrieval, or just running to the four corners in Cazic.  You can only
						cast this on yourself, but with this and Deadeye, you can remove some
						of a Wizard's burden. </p>

						<p><b><font color="#333366">Heat Blood:</font></b>  That spell you
						remember all too well from Befallen, but this time it's on your side.
						It will quickly become your favorite spell, doing 16 damage for 10
						ticks = 160 damage in 1 minute.  I'll have to retime this after the
						last DOT patch.  This will stack with the darkness line and later
						with Heart Flutter. </p>

            <p><b><font color="#333366">Lifedraw:</font></b> This steals 45 hp for
						about 126 mana.  Not very efficient, but cuts our downtime in half if
						there are mobs available to tap from.  When soloing, when the mobs starts
						running away (slowly because of darknessed) I tap for the rest of my 
						mana, usually killing it in the process.  With a decent amount of mana
						(or low total hp) you can regain about a bubble of health by tapping
						all your mana.  Our	three lifetap spells are most useful decreasing downtime by sucking 
						hp from low greens, or from neighboring group's pulls.</p>

						<p><b><font color="#333366">Restless Bones:</font></b>  A new pet,
						levels 16-19.  Haven't used my pet much except when soloing in Rathe. </p>

						<p><strike><b><font color="#333366">Voice Graft:</font></b>  This spell lets
						you talk through your pet, and will no doubt be interesting to heavy RP'ers,
						but has no other uses that I am aware of.</strike><font color="red">
						This spell was removed and replaced with LifeDraw.</font></p>

						<p><b><font color="#333366">Wave of Enfeeblement:</font></b>  Area
						effect strength debuff centered around you.  This uses 40 mana,
						does not give you the strength, and takes a bit to cast.  Possibly
						useful to taunt multiple mobs off a healer.  Right now I'm still
						using Siphon Strength and my Dark Reaver. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p><font color="#000033"><b><font size="3" color="#669933">
						Rank 5 - Level 39 (mostly level 16 Necro Spells)</font></b></font></p>
						<p></p>  
						
						<p><b><font color="#333366">Animate Dead:</font></b>
						At this point, I seldom use a pet.  They are only good for about 50
						to 100 points of damage during a solo fight if you are lucky.  Still,
						they are valuable in duels, or to take an opposing NPC SK's Harm Touch.
						The NPC will not HT your pet immediately, you have to let him fight 
						a few seconds without interfering.  I assume this is due to some placement
						on the aggro list and the pets limited damage capabilities.
						</p>
						<p><b><font color="#333366">Cancel Magic:</font></b>
						I don't really use this spell.  Instead, I buy Egg-Shaped Pumice 
						from potion vendors.
						</p>
						<p><b><font color="#333366">Expulse Undead:</font></b>
						Not a bad nuke, I suppose, but takes a bit long to cast.  It'll do
						94 damage for 60 mana.  I throw this in if I'm hurt in a fight and
						have to step out from tanking.  Of course, if you're too hurt, you
						don't really need to aggro the mob anymore until someone throws
					  a heal your way.</p>
						<p><b><font color="#333366">Heart Flutter:</font></b>
						Now this is a prize spell.  144 points of DOT, but debuffs the
						targets strength and armor class.  It has replaced Heat Blood for me,
						and I cast it for the debuffing effects as the damage is piddly at 
						this level.  Also, necro's have stopped using it, and don't get an
						upgrade until the level 44 spell, Asystole, so you don't have to worry
						about DOT overlap.
						</p>
						<p><b><font color="#333366">Resist Cold:</font></b>
						A 40 point resistance buff, which is quite significant.  Great in Sol B
						when fighting Kobold Shamen, and in L Guk when fighting Greater Ice Bones,
						and the various Wizard froglocks.  It's the best buff you have that can
						be cast on other players, and something to do with your extra downtime
						mana.
						</p>
						<p><b><font color="#333366">Shadow Vortex:</font></b>
						Another great spell.  Recently upgraded, shadow vortex steals 12 armor
						class from the target, similar to siphon str.  The mob loses 12 ac, and
						you gain it for a few minutes.  This stacks with Heart Flutter on the 
						mob, and with any other AC buff on yourself.  It's worth casting almost
						every fight, or at least every few minutes to keep it up.  In addition,
						this spell is a decent taunt, and casts in 1.5 seconds.  In that regard,
						it's the upgraded Disease Cloud in the sense of high taunt-factor spells.
						</p>
						<p><b><font color="#333366">Shieldskin:</font></b>
						This spell replaced Banshee Aura, which I never had the opportunity to
						cast.  This spell gives you a buff that absorbs the first 60 or so
						hp of damage you take, which at this level, can often be less than one
						single hit.  But, if you cast it on yourself, and then have to zone out
						with 60 or less hp, it saved your life.  I use it on occasion while
						soloing or when grouped without a healer.  Another use is to cast it
						on yourself before using dark empathy to heal someone else.  You can
						then cast dark empathy 3 times and only lose about 15 hp, as opposed
						to the 75 you would have.  Each cast requires a cat's eye agate, which
						will run you about 2 gold.
