              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My 
                ears hurt.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It 
                seemed to be a strange feeling, given the warm summer-like weather, 
                but nevertheless, they did. Looking over my shoulder, I realized 
                that in all likelihood, any pains that I might be feeling were 
                more of a psychological nature than actual physical distress. 
                They were still at it – shouting and stomping, chasing hither 
                and yon after any small creature that caught their fancy. One 
                fell backwards onto the muddy path, with an amusingly shocked 
                look upon his face – I had told them to leave the basilisks alone. 
                I shook my head, beads of water dripping from my chin, and thought 
                about how I had gotten into this silly situation.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                am a hunter. It is what I do, both by choice and vocation. My 
                days are spent running across the land, crouched behind trees, 
                or sighting down the shaft of an arrow. To me, there is nothing 
                more exciting than the thrill of the chase…the pounding heart…the 
                adrenaline rush when the prey is finally cornered…. And if I can 
                make a few coins in the process, it is all the better.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                hunting in my home forest of Faydwer until the constant chatter 
                running through the trees drove me to distraction (I can easily 
                understand why the orcs attack everyone in sight at times.), I 
                thought I might travel to the docks of Butcherblock and see what 
                opportunities I might find across the seas. I stocked up on my 
                gear and picked up a few of my recently crafted bows as well, 
                hoping to make some coin in the greater market away from my homelands. 
                With the rising sun behind me, I began my journey. The forest 
                was peaceful in the early light, and it was this peace that put 
                me into a very pleasant mood. Soon, I traveled through the pass 
                into Butcherblock, thinking to soon reach my departure point.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Not 
                long after entering into the dwarven lands, I was approached by 
                a group of locals. Apparently my name had proceeded me for they 
                knew that I was a ranger-trained hunter who sometimes hired out 
                my skills. It seems that a pair of ogres roams the mountains, 
                preying upon any wayfarers they come upon. These adventurous dwarves 
                had gathered for the goal of destroying these creatures (and collecting 
                the reward offered, I later learned). As I had helped one of their 
                brothers in the Steamfont mountains a week or so earlier, they 
                immediately offered me 20 pieces of gold to help them find one 
                of these creatures – a surly beast known as Corflunk.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">For 
                20 pieces of gold, my friends, I’d lead them anywhere…or so I 
                thought.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hastily 
                sealing our bargain, I asked them where this foul creature usually 
                hunted. Knowing the nature of a beast allows a hunter to anticipate 
                the prey’s every move. With that knowledge in mind, I began my 
                work. The mountains are a beautiful place, easy on the feet and 
                eyes, and I felt sure that my skills would soon lead them to their 
                goal…and me to my gold.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Being 
                a solitary traveler, I am used to refining my choices, focusing 
                in upon one goal, and pursuing it until completion. As such, that 
                is what I expected this hunt to be. I could not have been more 
                wrong. My employers seemed to have the stealth of a mammoth calf 
                and the attention span of a pixie. Every creature that crossed 
                our path fell victim to their swords and axes. Sometimes, to my 
                amusement, they bit off more than they could handle. Quickly hiding 
                myself among the trees, I would watch them as they ran, short 
                legs pumping, to the nearest guard station, yelling for assistance. 
                A simple hunt…the thrill of the chase…the valiant slaying of a 
                foul beast…. This was merely the playing of children, and I began 
                to feel that the 20 pieces of gold were nothing more than a collar 
                about my neck. And to top it off, my fine summer day clouded over, 
                and rain began to fall.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">My 
                reverie was broken by a scent brought upon the wind. Even the 
                downpour soaking us to the bone could not cover the smell of the 
                carrion-beast. With a slashing motion of my axe, I told my employers 
                to cease their prattle, eliciting looks of surprise as they lifted 
                their stunned friend from the muddy path in which he’d fallen. 
                Scanning the trees…. Listening for the movement…. Breathing in 
                deeply the scents of the forest…. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There! 
                With a wave to the dwarves, I ran off into the woods. No natural 
                beast of this area would cause the hush that had fallen among 
                the birds or the smell that drifted on the air. Corflunk was here, 
                and I would find him!</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">His 
                tracks proved what I had already guessed. The beast was easily 
                twice my size and probably more like three times my weight. Whatever 
                foul anger he held, he expressed violently to all the trees and 
                animals that happened to cross his path. I followed his trail 
                over a hill and through a winding valley, finally reaching…</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Beast.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Corflunk, 
                for it could be no other, stood some 20 yards away with his back 
                turned to me. His scarred face was the sweetest thing I had seen 
                in hours. Not only had I again brought the prey to bear, but I 
                also had fulfilled the terms of my bondage and would soon be free. 
                Turning to the dwarves, I caught the eyes of their paladin leader, 
                signing to him in the language of hunters around the world (which 
                I only hoped these underground dwellers would understand) that 
                their prey was just ahead and unaware of us. I quickly began to 
                think of an ambush plan…and was shocked into stunned silence as 
                5 dwarves began yelling at the tops of their lungs, crashing through 
                the trees like miniature bulls, and dove headfirst at the creature 
                easily as big as all of them together! Like a pack of hounds upon 
                a bear, they threw themselves at the ogre, blades swinging and 
                battle cries shattering the silence. Amazing! Even as I regarded 
                their lack of sense with shocked amazement, I felt grudging respect 
                for their bravery…or their madness!</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Beast, however, obviously felt no such respect. As the first cry 
                sounded out, he turned with a look of confusion upon his face. 
                This look turned to feral glee as the dwarves careened down the 
                hillside, and he lifted his treelike paws to welcome them. The 
                battle joined, and I rapidly began to wonder who the victor would 
                be. The blades of the dwarves bit deeply into the Beast’s hide, 
                but his massive blows drove one after another of the small ones 
                to the ground. Slaying the beast had not been part of my hire 
                – it had even been mentioned that I was not to engage the creature 
                as this was &quot;work fer the stout blades of dwarves, not the 
                fair nature of elves.&quot; However, my employers were falling 
                fast, with only the healing ability of their cleric and the paladin’s 
                god-given powers keeping them in the fray. Corflunk was too much. 
                The hounds had cornered the wolf…and found him to be a kodiak 
                instead!</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Shaking 
                my head, I limbered my bow, its fine elm arms glistening wetly 
                in the rain. Sighting down the shaft of the first arrow, I let 
                fly. Before the shaft had thudded into the creature’s fur covered 
                chest, I had strung another. Shaft after shaft I sent, pounding 
                into the Beast until I though surely my arm would weaken to the 
                point of dropping my bow. Two of the dwarves remained – the paladin 
                and another warrior who fought bravely with a spear twice his 
                own size. Neither of them looked as if they could last another 
                minute, but luckily, neither did Corflunk. With the realization 
                of his doom finally penetrating the thick haze of his anger, and 
                the Beast turned tail and began to flee. Calling upon the gifts 
                of my training, I muttered the words of magic that would bind 
                the plants of the mountains to my will, and they began wrapping 
                themselves about the giant, immobilizing him where he stood. The 
                dwarves, knowing themselves to be at the end of their abilities, 
                did not follow, but looked to me and my bow instead. Nodding to 
                the paladin, I raised the bow one last time, aiming the shaft 
                at the Beast’s one remaining eye. Corflunk glared at me, spouting 
                thick unpronounceable syllables in some dark tongue…and then fell 
                to the ground as the shaft pierced his brain. The Beast lay dead.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Silence. 
                No words spoken. The surviving dwarves fell to their knees, doing 
                what they could to staunch the wounds of their fellows. I went 
                with them, offering up what healing magic and binding of wounds 
                I could do. This accomplished, the paladin walked to the ogre’s 
                corpse and performed the grisly duty of removing Corflunk’s head, 
                which he dropped into a large bag. Limping back to me, he nodded 
                and tossed me a small bag that *<b>clinked*</b> as I caught it.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                winked at me, holding out a hand. &quot;Yer not much of a fighter 
                with that axe, do ye know that?&quot;</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                nodded back as we shook. &quot;And you, my short and bold friend, 
                are not much of a hunter.&quot;</font></p>
