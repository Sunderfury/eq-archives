                always known that BlackBurrow was a dangerous place. I’d always 
                ignored that fact. One day, not too long ago, I learned just how 
                dangerous BlackBurrow really was. That was also the day I discovered 
                what a true friend really is. It all started one bright morning 
                when I was a ranger of the 7<sup>th</sup> circle…</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;I 
                awaken to the bright rays of the dawn sun. The light shines down 
                into Surefall Glade and creates flickering patterns through the 
                tree leaves. I stand up and stretch out a bit, then pack up my 
                bedroll. I pass by Hager Sureshot and nod as I head for Jarse 
                Kedison. After purchasing some supplies, I sit on the barrels 
                in front of the cabin and pull out my fletching kit. For the next 
                ten minutes, I busy myself making some arrows for use in the coming 
                day. I then place the completed arrows in my quiver and head into 
                the cabin. Sitting at the table is my friend and fellow ranger 
                Pirelis Windbearer. He waves me over and I see that he is studying 
                some kind of old map.</font></p>

                What about it?&quot;</font></p>

              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;It’s 
                a map of BlackBurrow. I was digging through the druid archives 
                and I found this.&quot; He points to a mark on the map. &quot;Here 
                is an old treasure vault. Want to do some treasure hunting?&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Um…well. 
                I’ve been in that accursed place before, Pirelis, it’s full of 
                gnolls.&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Oh 
                come on, Baratol, don’t be such a wimp. A few mangy dogs aren’t 
                going to be able to best the both of us!&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Reluctantly, 
                I agree with Pirelis and we immediately set off. As we pass through 
                the cave leading out of our home, we go over some battle strategies. 
                We agree that since I am a tad stronger and more experienced than 
                Pirelis, I will be in front as we explore the caverns. We emerge 
                from the caves and pause a moment to get our bearings. I point 
                to the southeast and we silently trudge off. After a few minutes 
                of travel, we arrive at the entrance to the gnolls’ lair. A giant 
                gnoll head carved out of the stone marks the entrance. I look 
                over and notice that Pirelis doesn’t seem so brave anymore. Chuckling 
                to myself, I enter the cave and pass into the gnolls’ home.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;We 
                emerge into a small valley within the surrounding mountains. We 
                are greeted by a gnoll who thumps to the floor in front of us 
                bleeding from several deep wounds. I look up and see a weary paladin 
                kneel down and loot the corpse. Carefully stepping around, we 
                make our way to the cavern entrance as indicated by the map. I 
                pull open the door and see a scrawny gnoll sitting on a log chewing 
                on a chunk of wolf meat. I draw back my bow and let an arrow fly. 
                The shaft digs itself deep into the gnoll’s thigh. He howls and 
                draws a short sword, then charges straight at me. I quickly swing 
                my bow around my shoulder and ready my trusty minotaur axe and 
                shield. The gnoll wildly chops at my head and I easily deflect 
                the blow with my shield. An arrow soars by and catches the gnoll 
                in the shoulder. Out of the corner of my eye, I see Pirelis nock 
                another arrow. The gnoll staggers backwards and turns to run. 
                I rear back and deliver a mighty blow between the gnoll’s shoulder 
                blades. It chokes up some blood and drops to the floor. I pick 
                up the sword and put it in my pack, then split up the few coppers 
                it had with Pirelis. &quot;See? No problem!&quot; he says. I mutely 
                nod my head and we continue in deeper.</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;We 
                follow the map and dispatch the few scrawny gnolls who attempt 
                to stop us. We turn the final bend and come up face to face with 
                a patrolling gnoll. Both of us loose arrows, which catch the gnoll 
                in the stomach. Howling in pain, the filthy creature turns and 
                runs away. Pirelis grins and pulls open the door to the room. 
                Inside, we see several small chests lying on the floor. Pirelis 
                pulls one open and gasps in astonishment. I peer over his shoulder 
                and blink at the pile of gold coins lying within. Pirelis stands 
                up and starts cheering, then cuts short. I spin around and choke 
                at the sight of two very large gnolls standing in the doorway. 
                The closer one bellows, &quot;You half-elves aren’t welcome here!&quot; 
                and charges straight at me. I brace for the impact and it slams 
                into me at full force. My shield straps snap and the protective 
                wooden circle spins away. The gnoll raises up a wicked-looking 
                bastard sword and brings it straight down. I deftly roll to the 
                side and the sword crashes down on top of a chest. I look up and 
                see that Pirelis seems to be having a hard time. The other gnoll 
                has him backed into a corner and is chopping away, while my friend 
                desperately tries to fend off the blows. I lash out with my foot 
                and I hear a cracking sound as my foot connects with the gnoll’s 
                knee. He growls in pain and shifts his weight slightly. I kick 
                out and knock the gnoll back and he trips over a chest. I jump 
                up and look over at Pirelis. The gnoll confronting him knocks 
                Pirelis’s sword aside and bashes Pirelis across the face. Dazed, 
                my friend lets his guard down for a moment. Seizing the opportunity, 
                the gnoll drives his sword deep within Pirelis’s chest. &quot;NOO!&quot; 
                I scream, and blindly rush at the gnoll, swinging wildly. The 
                gnoll drops down on top of Pirelis, and I am roughly shoved forward 
                from behind. There is a searing pain in the back of my leg, and 
                I stumble into the wall. The large gnoll I knocked over before 
                stands before me with my blood dripping from its sword. Drool 
                drips from its mouth, and he licks his lips as he advances towards 
                me. The pain from my leg shoots up my body and my vision fades. 
                My last thought is &quot;I wonder what the afterlife is like?&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;I 
                awaken after what seems to be an eternity, and to my disappointment, 
                discover that I am not in the afterlife. In fact, I’m still in 
                the same room. The only thing different is that the gnoll is now 
                lying on the floor in front of me choking for breath. I crawl 
                over to the corner and pull the dead gnoll off of Pirelis. His 
                face is pale, and his breathing is shallow and ragged. Blood pours 
                out of his chest wound. He looks over at me and gasps, &quot;Guess 
                it wasn’t so easy after all.&quot; I smile briefly and say, &quot;Hold 
                on, Pirelis, I’ll get help.&quot; He quietly shakes his head and 
                leans back. His breathing slows, then stops. I stare blankly at 
                the corpse, then start sobbing. A feeling of sorrow and hopelessness 
                fills my entire being. Suddenly, a voice cuts through my haze. 
                &quot;I’m sorry, I couldn’t get here fast enough.&quot; I look 
                up and see a beautiful female wood elf wearing enchanter’s robes 
                standing in the doorway. Wondering why angels wear enchanter’s 
                robes, I slide to the floor and black out. </font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;My 
                head throbs as a gentle light shines through my closed eyes. My 
                leather cloak has been draped over me. In the center of the room, 
                a lit lantern shines throughout the room. I slowly sit up, and 
                glance around the rest of the room. The wood elf is in the opposite 
                corner, meditating. Pirelis’s corpse has been covered with his 
                cloak. The gnoll corpses are neatly lined up against the wall 
                to my left. My equipment lies in the center of the room, as well 
                as the things the gnolls had been carrying. I reach down to my 
                leg and find that my wound has been bandaged. I shift and lean 
                up against the wall. The wood elf opens her eyes and looks at 
                me. I catch a nearly imperceptible flicker in her eyes, then they 
                resolve into an emotionless state. &quot;I am Verylia Celestias 
                of Kelethin,&quot; she states. I start, and pause a moment before 
                replying, &quot;Uh…I am Baratol Alaryn of Surefall Glade. Um, 
                pleased to make your acquaintance.&quot; Verylia smiles gently, 
                and says, &quot;Same. I am sorry about your friend. When I heard 
                the sounds of combat, I rushed over, but not quickly enough.&quot; 
                I glance over at the shrouded corpse of my friend and pause to 
                collect my thoughts. &quot;I just wish we had not been so foolish 
                as to delve so deeply into this place.&quot; Verylia nods silently 
                and says nothing. &quot;Still, I…I should b…bury h…his…corpse.&quot; 
                I struggle to hold back my tears and cup my face in my hands. 
                After a few minutes, I manage to regain control of myself and 
                slowly stand up. While stiff, my leg will support my weight. I 
                gather my equipment and sling my pack over my back. Verylia stands 
                and picks up her staff. She chants some words of magic, and my 
                muscles tighten briefly, and I feel a new strength surging through 
                me. Smiling my thanks, I bend over and lift the corpse of my friend 
                over my shoulder. </font></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;We 
                travel back towards the surface, and stop when we hear the sounds 
                of combat nearby. I gently lower the corpse to the ground, and 
                ready my bow. I step around the corner into total chaos. Several 
                fellow adventurers have taken it upon themselves to stir up a 
                hornet’s nest of gnolls. I count at least fifteen of those horrid 
                creatures. Two of the gnolls are lying on the floor, gasping for 
                breath. The adventurers fare worse, as three of their six are 
                down. Whispering a prayer to Karana, I nock an arrow and release. 
                The shaft flies true, burying itself within the neck of a gnoll. 
                A strong-looking gnoll turns from the adventurer it had been hacking 
                at and turns towards me. Immediately, it chokes and collapses 
                to the floor, a dagger stuck in its back. The rogue nods and returns 
                to the rest of the melee. Verylia casts a spell and a gnoll chokes 
                and sputters. The creature turns and rushes, but I intercept its 
                path with a well-placed blow to the shoulder. It turns towards 
                me angrily and a brief clash ensues. I easily best the gnoll and 
                look over to the rest of the battle. A cleric has been knocked 
                to the floor and a paladin is desperately fending off three more 
                gnolls. Verylia casts a spell and a glaze settles over a gnoll’s 
                eyes. It howls in desperation and the paladin cleaves his mighty 
                two-handed sword through the gnoll. I rush up from behind and 
                slice a gnoll from shoulder to kidney. The few remaining gnolls 
                rush away, screaming in defiance. I manage to pick off a couple 
                with my bow, but some still escape my wrath. </font></p>

              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">&#9;When 
                I finally return to the light of day, my clothing and equipment 
                has been bloodied and dirtied from the multiple melees. Verylia 
                has a few more dings in her hardwood staff, but is otherwise unharmed. 
                I dig a shallow grave for my friend and place his body within. 
                I place his equipment on the overturned dirt. Kneeling, I close 
                my eyes and murmur a short prayer. We then pace to a small copse 
                of trees to rest and recover. </font></p>

              <p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                have closed my eyes for but a moment when my sensitive ranger 
                senses catch a whiff of the gnolls’ stench. My eyes burst open 
                and I shout out, &quot;Alert!&quot; With a growl, several gnoll 
                scouts rush towards us. Verylia fumbles for her staff, but I see 
                she will not reach it in time. In desperation, I hurl my axe with 
                all my strength. The well-forged blade cuts through the air and 
                buries itself in the gnoll’s chest. I quickly draw my bow and 
                fire an arrow into a gnoll’s leg. The thing stumbles to the floor 
                and yowls pitiably. Verylia grabs her staff in time to ward off 
                a blow from a gnoll. She counters with a swift blow to the thing’s 
                snout, knocking it back. Too late, I catch sight of the gnoll 
                archer a way off. Its arrow pierces through the air, whistling 
                towards Verylia. The sharp point digs into her shoulder and drives 
                her to the ground. I return fire, and manage to drive it off. 
                Three more gnolls carefully advance at me, while one more stands 
                back. I grab hold of my trusty axe and turn to face them. They 
                come at me with carefully coordinated blows, and I am forced up 
                against a tree. I shout to Verylia &quot;Run! I’ll hold them off 
                as long as I can!&quot; She fades into some of the surrounding 
                trees. I hope I can fend the gnolls long enough for her to reach 
                safety. One gnoll slips through my defense, and its sword nicks 
                my ribs. I wince and my axe wavers. Sensing weakness, the gnoll 
                swings again. At that moment, a green aura swirls about it and 
                the gnoll abruptly staggers back, then falls dead. The next gnoll’s 
                eyes suddenly cloud with fear, and it sprints away. The gnoll 
                in back scowls, and chants a spell. Blue sparkles fill the air 
                about me, and I feel my magical strength leave. I wilt slightly, 
                then kick the gnoll in front of me squarely in the chest. It falls 
                backwards on top of a sword of one of its fallen fellows. Verylia 
                steps out besides me, and I’m sure that if she had not stayed, 
                I would have been killed. She and the gnoll shaman begin casting 
                spells simultaneously. Its spell resolves first, causing that 
                same blue sparkle about her. I wince inwardly as I know this will 
                remove the magical shielding used by spell-casters for protection. 
                Her spell resolves next, and several large tendrils poke up and 
                grasp the gnoll’s feet. I release an arrow. The shaft flies straight 
                at the panic-stricken gnoll. It drops to the floor, arrow protruding 
                from its eye. Weak from blood loss, I slump to the floor. I look 
                up at Verylia. I blink and stare in shock as I realize something 
                is very wrong. She is a dark elf. She must have noticed something 
                in my eyes, as she looked down at herself. Verylia closes her 
                eyes for a moment, then looks straight at me, pain evident in 
                her eyes. &quot;I’m sorry, Baratol. It was a necessary deception.&quot; 
                She casts a spell, and a magical gate opens up before her. &quot;Wait! 
                It matters not!&quot; I call out to the last flickering remnants 
                of magic dissipating into the air. I have never seen her since.</font></p>
