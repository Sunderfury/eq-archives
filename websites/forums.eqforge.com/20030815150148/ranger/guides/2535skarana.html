                a good mixture of four things: xp, coin (or coin-equivalent), 
                rare MoBs/drops, and a relative lack of danger. For characters 
                in the 25-35 level range – especially Rangers and Druids – the 
                &quot;Spires&quot; area of South Karana offers all four things

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                Guide is divided into two main parts: (I) a discussion of how 
                to hunt at the Spires; and (II) tips on why, how, and where to 
                &quot;Track-n’-Whack&quot; rare MoBs in SK. By combining a steady 
                diet of gnolls from the Spires with the occasional rare MoB, you 
                can steadily level and earn cash while exploiting every opportunity

                comparison’s sake, the Strike Force is composed of a Mage, a Druid, 
                and a Ranger of approximately equal level. We started at the Spires 
                when we were all around 25<sup>th</sup> level (and the resident 
                Tesch Mas<b> </b>Gnolls were even-to-red to us), and did not leave 
                the area until we hit 35<sup>th</sup> level and some of the gnolls 
                stopped giving xps. In other words, everything discussed in this 
                Guide can be done with a group of at least three characters –

                Spires are found in South Karana surrounding the entrance to the 
                Splitpaw zone, roughly at loc neg3000, pos800. If you run straight 
                south from the bridge that connects North Karana to South Karana, 
                you will eventually come upon the Spires. The Spires are impossible 
                to miss for anyone traveling in the southern part of SK – look 
                for the three tall talon-shaped towers jutting skyward around 
                a small hilly area. Indeed, the Spire area is supposed to represent 
                an upside-down gnoll paw pointing skyward, with the Spires serving 
                as the gnoll’s claws and the hilly area between the Spires representing 
                the pads of the gnoll’s paw. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each 
                hunting site at the Spires offers similar benefits: steady (and 
                mostly-static) spawns of melee-only gnolls that provide excellent 
                xp and loot; just enough downtime between spawns to stay healthy 
                and mana-happy; minimal danger of wandering MoBs and trains; and 
                close proximity to the Splitpaw zone entrance for those rare instances

                    Spire,&quot; and &quot;North Spire.&quot; Quick use of your 
                    Sense Heading skill will show you which is which or, if you 
                    are standing at the Splitpaw entrance (it is a hole carved 
                    into the side of a small hill in the middle of the Spires) 
                    facing away from the entrance, the South Spire is to your 
                    right, the Middle Spire is directly ahead of you, and the

                    Spires increase in difficulty as one goes from South to Middle 
                    to North. Only one gnoll spawns at the South Spire (every 
                    6-10 minutes or so). The Middle Spire has a slightly faster 
                    spawn rate and a small chance that two gnolls will spawn. 
                    The North Spire spawns alternate between the standard static 
                    gnoll and a pair of gnolls that start to run as soon as they 
                    spawn. The runners briefly split apart (heading in opposite 
                    ways), then come back together in front of the North Spire 
                    before heading, in tandem, counter-clockwise away from that 
                    Spire.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Camping 
                    the three Spires is relatively easy – stand with your back 
                    to a Spire, walk about fifty paces, and turn around. Once 
                    the gnoll(s) spawn, pull and kill as you prefer, and as best 
                    suits your group’s makeup. The three-member Strike Force generally 
                    used the &quot;root-&amp;-shoot&quot; method: the ranger would 
                    Root the gnoll, the ranger and druid would slap DoTs on the 
                    gnoll, and then everyone would throw in a DD or bow-shot. 
                    By the time the Root broke, the gnoll would be around half-strength 
                    and would not take long to eliminate. As long as one party 
                    member can keep an eye on the spawn, the other members can 
                    meditate and heal up for the next spawn.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    &quot;Ledge&quot; (the Strike Force’s home-away-from-home 
                    from levels 30 to 35) is the fourth, and hardest, camping 
                    spot at the Spires. To find the Ledge, stand directly in front 
                    of the Splitpaw cave entrance, facing the entrance, and look 
                    toward &quot;one o’clock&quot; (you will be facing Northwest). 
                    You will see a flat plateau, with a hill rising to its left 
                    and a downward slope falling away to its right. If no one 
                    is camping the Ledge, you will also see a lone gnoll staring 
                    right/North.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    Ledge generally has two types of spawns: a single static gnoll, 
                    and a gnoll that starts running North (downhill) as soon as 
                    it spawns. Every so often, the Ledge will spawn two static 
                    gnolls right on top of each other. The Ledge also gives you 
                    an excellent vantage point from which to pull the pair of 
                    runners that spawn at the North Spire – those runners move 
                    clockwise around the Spires until they get behind the Middle 
                    Spire, and then they climb the hill to the left of the Ledge. 
                    Thus, from the Ledge, you can pull the runners either when 
                    they are coming around the corner from the North Spire (if 
                    you are looking North, you will see them) or when they have 
                    come to rest atop the hill. Moreover, if you wait the runners 
                    out after they climb the hill, they eventually will separate 
                    from each other and you can pick them off individually.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                    Ledge can be camped from two places. Most groups stay on the 
                    flat ground about fifty paces to the North of the Ledge, and 
                    pull the gnolls down to them. The Strike Force, however, opts 
                    to camp on the Ledge itself. We take positions on the southern 
                    edge of the Ledge (the side closest to the Splitpaw zone entrance), 
                    facing North-Northwest, and deal with the gnolls from there. 
                    This high ground gives us an excellent vantage point over 
                    the entire Spire area – we can see when a Spire is abandoned 
                    (and then pull spawns from there to the Ledge), we can spot 
                    the North Spire runners as they sprint around the Spires, 
                    and we are close enough to the Ledge spawns that &quot;unintentional&quot; 
                    KSing from us (along the &quot;Oh, didn’t know you were camping 
                    that spawn&quot; type) is impossible. Most importantly, the 
                    Ledge is extremely close to the Splitpaw zone; because the 
                    Ledge is the one place at the Spires where you might encounter 
                    a &quot;mini-train&quot; of sorts, we recommend that you stay 
                    as close as possible to the zone entrance.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                    advise progressing through the Spires (from South to North) 
                    and then to the Ledge as you level from 25 to 35. Do not progress 
                    through these steps too quickly, as your inability to hold 
                    down a camp (particularly the North Spire runners) can wreak 
                    havoc for every other Spire group. At 25, the three-member 
                    Strike Force had all it could handle with the single static 
                    South Spire gnoll spawn. By 30, we could camp any of the three 
                    Spires without danger, but the Ledge still presented a real 
                    challenge (especially when a North Spire group could not handle 
                    the pair of runners). By the time we left the Ledge at 35, 
                    we could effectively handle both the Ledge <u>and</u> any 
                    &quot;extra&quot; spawn that we could pull from any of the 
                    three Spires.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
                    final note on the four Spire camps: they seem to attract an 
                    inordinate number of soloing Druids (usually in Wolf Form) 
                    who kill by kiting. As such, just because a Spire (or the 
                    Ledge) appears to be uncamped does not mean that it truly 
                    is vacant. We generally wait a few minutes (or until the next 
                    spawn) to ensure that the camp is &quot;ours&quot; before 
                    settling in.</font></p>

                    the Tesch Mas gnolls are the only MoB-type that spawns at 
                    the Spires, it pays to know your enemy. The gnolls range from 
                    25<sup>th</sup> to 29<sup>th</sup> level and are melee-only. 
                    Like gnolls that you might previously have fought in BlackBurrow 
                    or HighHold Pass, the Tesch Mas gnolls will aggro on you if 
                    you come within range, especially if you are engaged in a 
                    melee with another gnoll. Like those other gnolls, the Tesch 
                    Mas variety also will turn tail and try to run once you have 
                    them below approximately 20% of their hit points.</font></p>

                    Tesch Mas gnolls have a wide variety of drops. Each one will 
                    have some cash, ranging from the 1 cp booby-prize to a maximum 
                    of about 4 plat. About one in three gnolls will wield Fine 
                    Steel weapons – although these gnolls hit harder than their 
                    unarmed counterparts, each FS weapon brings about 6 plat from 
                    a merchant (the centaur merchants in SK gladly will purchase

                    gnolls also drop four categories of magic/quest items: Splitpaw 
                    armor, magic weapons, minor Splitpaw magic items, and Tesch 
                    Mas scrolls. The Splitpaw armor pieces – Belt, Mask, Tooth 
                    Necklace, Tunic, and Gloves – are suitable for characters 
                    in the 10-15 level range. The downside to Splitpaw armor is 
                    that it does not bring great value from merchants and, thus, 
                    you have to lug it out of the zone and go through the time-consuming 
                    auction value to maximize its cash value. We sold these items 
                    at first, but later began to use them mainly as newbie give-aways.

                    addition to the FS weapons, some Tesch Mas gnolls drop two 
                    magic weapons: the Dagger of Dropping and the Gnoll Hide Lariat. 
                    The Dagger is a 4/22 Piercing weapon that procs a Weaken effect 
                    at 6<sup>th</sup> level, and the Lariat is a 3/20 1HS weapon 
                    that procs a Stun effect at 25<sup>th</sup> level. Both weapons

                    gnolls away from your casters. The Dagger is an solid weapon 
                    for low-level casters, but we found that it did not auction 
                    easily. The Lariat is a decent off-hand weapon for low-level 
                    Rangers, Rogues, and Bards, and, because of its Stun effect, 
                    a <b>great</b> weapon for higher-level casters’ pets. Every 
                    so often, a high-level necro will wander through SK auctioning

                    at the Spires: the Split Paw, and the Preserved Splitpaw Eye. 
                    The Split Paw gives you several charges of &quot;Dance of 
                    the Fireflies,&quot; an outdoor- and night-only lightsource 
                    spell. The Eye serves as a minor lightsource (about the same 
                    as a fire beetle eye), gives you +2 on you Poison saves, as 
                    well as a right-clickable &quot;Glimpse&quot; (farsight) effect. 
                    At night, you can always tell which gnolls will drop the Eye,

                    some Tesch Mas gnolls drop Tanned Splitpaw Hides. These items 
                    are Lore, and look like rolled-up scrolls (as opposed to other, 
                    worthless, dropped hides that look more like an unscribed 
                    spell or newbie note). If you right-click on the Tanned Splitpaw 
                    Hide after you loot it, it will &quot;open&quot; and you will 
                    see a Volume number from 1 through 4. When you collect a full 
                    set of four, you can turn them in for one of two quests: Karana’s 
                    Tear, or the far more valuable (and time-consuming) Gem Inlaid 
                    Gauntlets. We will not reproduce the quest steps in this article, 
                    but will say that the Karana’s Tear quest simply requires 
                    you to give all four scrolls to a Qeynos NPC, who hands you 
                    xp and the Karana’s Tear earring (+5 Sta). The Gem Inlaid 
                    Gauntlets quest requires several cross-continental journeys 
                    and interactions with NPCs, but results in an excellent piece 
                    of armor usable by all races and classes: AC8, Dex +3, Sta 
                    +3. Players often place the Gem Inlaid Gauntlets in the same 
                    value category as Treant Fists and Lupine Claw Gauntlets. 
                    We have been able to sell Gem Inlaid Gauntlets for between 
                    350 and 500 plat, adding a whole new profit tier to the Spires. 
                    The gloves are Lore, though, so you can only quest for (and 
                    auction) one at a time. </font></p>

                will wander about, and might even aggro on you, but do not pose

                Similarly, you will see the odd Splitpaw Gnoll and Escaped Splitpaw 
                Gnoll; these gnolls are much less fearsome than their Tesch Mas 
                counterparts (apparently, the Tesch Mas and their cohorts have

                very rarely, a still-living Cyclops). The Undead Cyclops has a 
                lot of HPs, hits hard, and does not carry valuable drops. Fortunately, 
                you almost always can tell when the &quot;UC&quot; is coming: 
                not only is it large enough for you to spot from far away, but 
                players in SK tend to shout out its location as it roams around 
                the zone. If you are healthy and mana-happy, con it and take a

                patience that it requires. We have found that committing to this 
                strategy is well worth the trouble: one rare drop is the difference 
                between a good day at the Spires and a GREAT one.</font></p>

                effectively &quot;Track-n’-Whack,&quot; you really only need two 
                skills in your party (beyond the ability to kill whatever MoB 
                you engage): tracking (to find the MoBs) and the Spirit of the 
                Wolf spell (to catch them, especially the key named MoBs which, 
                as noted below, often travel at SoW speed). Druids have both of 
                these key skills but, because a Ranger’s tracking skill is far 
                better than any Druid’s, we strongly advise having a Ranger to 
                serve as the group’s tracker. This is not to say, however, that 
                a Druid’s tracking skills are redundant: in certain cases, a rare 
                MoB will show up on the Druid’s short-range track <u>before</u> 
                it shows up on the Ranger’s screen. Thus, even if you have a Ranger 
                tracking, it can pay off to have your group’s Druid keep an eye

                these steps have been taken, all that remains is for the tracker 
                to <b>constantly</b> hit Track and keep an eye out for named MoBs 
                (see below for a handy guide to SK’s named denizens). Indeed, 
                the Strike Force’s Ranger even tracks <u>during</u> gnoll battles 
                – the named MoBs are so rare and valuable (and the Tesch Mas gnolls 
                so easy to kill, root, etc.) that our Ranger is under strict orders 
                to activate his &quot;Rare MoB on track&quot; hotkey even if a 
                gnoll was just pulled.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 
                a named MoB spawns, the steps to take are obvious: the tracker 
                hits his &quot;Rare on track&quot; hotkey; the other group members 
                hit their /follow and &quot;Good to go&quot; hotkeys in quick 
                succession; and, when all members have sounded in, the tracker 
                takes off after the named MoB, towing his group members behind 
                him (and, if possible, letting the rest of the group in on the 
                identity of the target).</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                tracker will almost always be the first character to get a visual 
                fix on the target. When he does, his job is to check (and inform 
                the group of) the target’s /consider and engagement status. For 
                the /consider status, a simple &quot;Blue&quot; or &quot;Yellow&quot; 
                will do. There is no need to inform the group that a MoB has not 
                yet been engaged; if, however, the MoB currently is being fought, 
                the tracker should inform the group (to prevent inadvertent kill-stealing) 
                and bring the chase to a halt. In this situation, we advise remaining 
                very close to the fight – if the group fighting the MoB flees 
                or dies, you will have first dibs on an already-damaged MoB.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assuming 
                that the MoB is not previously engaged, the tracker should pull 
                the MoB to the group as quickly as possible. We have found that 
                a bow-shot from our Ranger is the fastest way to engage a named 
                MoB: our Ranger can hit from far away and, most importantly, without 
                stopping his sprint toward the target. If you are competing for 
                the MoB with another group, a split-second could make all the 
                difference between nabbing a rare drop and watching another group 
                enrich themselves at your expense.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 
                the MoB is beaten and looted, the group members should reform 
                their marching order (again, hotkeys make this easy) and instruct 
                the tracker to head back to their vacated Spires camp site. Even 
                if the named Mob ran you all over SK, there is an easy way to 
                get back to the Spires: the tracker will almost always be able 
                to track to a Tesch Mas gnoll and, thus, the Spires, from the 
                spot of your battle. With a little luck, your spot at the Spires 
                will still be open and you’ll be able to resume your gnoll slaughter, 
                hopefully with a new rare drop in hand.</font></p>

                close this Guide with a few words on one final way to make some 
                cash while camping the Spires: hiring your tracking skills out. 
                Although, in theory, a character might be willing to pay for the 
                location of <i>any</i> named SK MoB, only two such MoBs in our 
                experience have ever catalyzed characters to actually send zone-wide 
                shouts offering plat in exchange for the location of (and/or looting 
                rights to) the spawn: Brother Qwinn and Quillmane&#9;. If you 
                do see a message like this come across your screen, be sure to 
                write down the auctioning character’s name so that, in the inevitable 
                rush that starts when your track shows the right rare, you will 
                remember who wants to pay you.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Brother 
                Qwinn</b>, a 60+ NPC, is part of a Monk quest and has a very uneven 
                spawn schedule. Sometimes he is up for a whole day, but sometimes 
                you can go several days straight without ever tracking him. We 
                have seen desperate Monks offer as much as 500 plat for Qwinn’s 
                location. We recommend that, if you track him, you send the tracker 
                in pursuit to get the /loc, and use another group member to ask 
                the zone if anyone is searching for Qwinn (or to send a /tell 
                to any character that previously had offered plat for the /loc). 
                We advise not divulging Qwinn’s /loc, or even the name of your 
                group’s tracker, until the buyer pays in full.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Quillmane</b> 
                is a more complex matter, because high-level Mages looking to 
                complete their epic weapon quest could care less about most Quillmane 
                spawns – as noted above, the Pegasus Feather Cloak drops no more 
                than 25% of the time from Quillmane. We have, however, seen Mages 
                offer up to 5,000 plat for looting rights to the Cloak, and have 
                heard of offers up to 10,000 plat in value. That is a lot of cash 
                for the mere use of your tracking skill!</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 
                course, there is no way to tell what Quillmane will drop until 
                he is slain, and the No Drop nature of the Cloak makes it impossible 
                to just loot and sell it. Accordingly, if you are looking to sell 
                looting rights, we advise that you NEVER let on that you are tracking 
                Quillmane until it lies dead at your feet. Then, carefully right-click 
                on Quill’s corpse – if you see the Cloak icon, be extra-careful 
                not to put your cursor anywhere near it. Have one group member 
                keep a right-click on the corpse (to prevent ninja looting) and 
                have another member do the auctioning. We advise proceeding in 
                three steps: (1) first, send /tells to any Mages who previously 
                stated their interest in the Cloak; (2) then, do a /who Magician 
                to identify the Mages in the zone, and then send them /tells asking 
                if they are interested; and (3) finally, do a zone-wide /shout 
                asking if anyone wants to purchase looting rights to the Pegasus 
                Cloak.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever 
                you do, do <b>not</b> spend more than five (or so) minutes auctioning 
                the Cloak – like any corpse, Quillmane’s corpse eventually will 
                disappear, and you certainly do not want to be left empty-handed. 
                We suggest that you accept no less than 5,000 plat for looting 
                rights – your potential customers will be high-level Mages who
