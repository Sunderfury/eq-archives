                bidding all to follow in his wake</font>

                Determined to see, by the end of the night<br>
                only he or Vox would survive</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Out of the shadows stepped a thief<br>
                Koraf Youngblood by name <br>
                Scarred by Ghoul Lord, Avatar claw, and mighty sword<br>
                Yet undaunted, and eager to face Vox's flame</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                As they waited <br>
                for their general to appear<br>
                They sported with the giants <br>
                in the castle, and showed no fear</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Finally, <br>
                with the Captain no where in sight<br>
                A cry rang out from Nino<br>
                "To your groups men!, let us begin this fight!"</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Each now joined his comrades,<br>
                and made ready for the fight<br>
                Each was with friends old, and friends new<br>
                lending confidence, this night</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                *Time was spent, waiting for the General to appear<br>
                but the time had come, should they wait? Nay<br>
                A cry again came from Nino,<br>
                "Tdira, have your group lead us into the fray!"</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                As they entered the halls of Permafrost Keep<br>
                the goblins all quaked in fear<br>
                For in their short lives they had never seen<br>
                such power as was gathered here</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Into the shadows<br>
                the goblins faded away<br>
                Upon their knees they fell and prayed<br>
                So that they maight see yet another day</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Yet, the heroes had no interest in those <br>
                who would move aside<br>
                However, those that didn't...<br>
                stood, fought, and died.<br>
                <br>
                To the Goblin King's Court they now strode<br>
                their purpose firm, their confidence at it's crown<br>
                And in the face of the King's defiance<br>
                they charged forth, and struck him down.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Here they paused once more, <br>
                and waited for Nino's assent to go again.<br>
                For behind the King's court were two giant doors<br>
                here the challenges would begin.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Their pasue was short, and then warriors strode forth,<br>
                with great strength the doors were riven<br>
                Behind them stood a the Giant Diplomat, <br>
                And battle was given</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                The Giant could not stand long, <br>
                against such overwhelming Might<br>
                Such was the invaders' power<br>
                he was deprived at even the chance of flight</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Now, surging forth, <br>
                they poured down the halls<br>
                Till two more Giants appeared<br>
                and the dungeon echoed with their battle calls</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                This melee was more difficult than the last<br>
                as both giants worked together to stomp their tiny prey<br>
                Yet, the swarm of skilled fighters and mages prevailed<br>
                and the heroes won the day.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Here the milling throng stopped again<br>
                for most were deeper than ever before<br>
                Fear now crept in<br>
                and some grew doubtful of the outcome of the war</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Yet, as they paused, confronting their doubt<br>
                cheers were heard in the north<br>
                The Captain had arrived!<br>
                The battle could go forth!</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Kalaran Windblade strode through the crowd<br>
                and into the dungeon the force he lead<br>
                With terrors and traps on all sides<br>
                in his footsteps they were careful to tread</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Many dangers and fell creatures the heroes did overcome<br>
                they were burned, and frozen.... chilled, and thrown<br>
                Death lurked in every corner<br>
                The icy walls echoed with war cry, and wounded's moan.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Yet, through spell and sword they came on,<br>
                overcoming all that dared stand in their way.<br>
                Nothing could stand before them, and soon<br>
                they won their way to the cave of their prey.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Here they rested, and healed<br>
                For no one knew what the next battle would bring<br>
                No one had before tread where they were about to go<br>
                And would it be of victory, death, or cowardly retreat that the 
                bards would sing.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Now, the Captain gathered them close<br>
                and issued his orders for the coming fight<br>
                All had to pull together, as one,<br>
                or death would be the only reward this night</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Then, with a hue and cry, the heroes charged forth<br>
                the guardians of the wyrmqueen not slow to respond<br>
                Many Giants now opposed the heroes advance<br>
                clerics, magi, and wizards... enough magic to make even the stoutest 
                heart despond</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                The battle which ensued rent the fabric of reality itself<br>
                the air was alive with force, fire, ice... pure magic power<br>
                As warriors tried to ply their doughy trade.<br>
                in the face of such an unearthly display, not a one could be seen 
                to cower</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                A Priest of Veeshan was the first to fall<br>
                the ground trembled with his landing<br>
                His last act, to curse his killers<br>
                and to urge on his fellows still standing<br>
                <br>
                But the tide had turned, the heroes felt it in the air<br>
                With renewed vigor they swung and cast<br>
                Their spells and swords struck true<br>
                And soon they were facing the last</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                The last giant, a priest like the first, saw his own death at 
                hand, <br>
                and decided to do to the heroes the worst<br>
                With a prayer to Veeshan for the defense of his land<br>
                A fell magic he cast, and the hero's Captain fell cursed.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                With the Giant's last breath, that fell magic was cast, <br>
                and as such, it had a power none could match<br>
                The Captain was not dead, that much was true<br>
                However, his spirit had been forced out, that was the catch<br>
                <br>
                The heroes were left, alone in the room, <br>
                leaderless, and with Vox awake too<br>
                Giantish reinforcement could be heard on the way,<br>
                a cry went up, "What shall we do!?"</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Attempts were made to move Kalaran's form,<br>
                the curse, however, held him bound<br>
                A choice then had to be made<br>
                to continue on, or to wait till a cure could be found.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Time was short, the pressure was on<br>
                and the decision had to be made<br>
                For out of all the choices<br>
                only through action could the heroes be saved</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Koraf then stood, and with a hue and cry<br>
                ran straight for the Wyrm Queen's form<br>
                And cursing his folly and yelling their rage<br>
                the heroes came on in a storm</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Lady Vox was ready and with a dragonish hiss<br>
                She summoned a pillar of flame<br>
                Into the charging mass she cast it<br>
                And with one swipe cut Stridar in twain</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Now the battle was joined, and magics were cast<br>
                and fire raged all around<br>
                Yet such was the strength of Vox's armor<br>
                that she was unhurt even as she was flame crowned</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                The battle raged on, and damage was done<br>
                but more heroes were starting to fall<br>
                Gerahben and Krimson were struck down<br>
                and it appeared the heroes would die, all.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Yet the damage to Vox was mounting<br>
                As the heroes learned her evil ways<br>
                Kadail scaled her back and landed his Dag'<br>
                Even as he was thrown and landed, dazed<br>
                <br>
                Vox was then smitten by the ArchWizard's magic<br>
                And turning she rushed him, past all in her way<br>
                Mighty in magic beyond all, Ranstan cast till the last<br>
                But he too tasted death that day.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                With many now dead, and the Dragon still strong<br>
                most would have run away.<br>
                But not this group of heroes, with one voice they cried,<br>
                "Death to Vox! We shall have our revenge this day!"</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                The Dragon who had killed so many,<br>
                still faced many yet<br>
                And who's not to say that in her brain<br>
                she counted the odds and began to sweat</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                For the heroes continued fighting<br>
                As I've said, not a one<br>
                Had second thoughts about staying<br>
                or leaving before the job was done</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Lady Vox, still dangerous, was more desperate now, <br>
                her spells came slower too<br>
                They redoubled their efforts, and sword and spell struck flesh<br>
                a cry rang out from Myrlynn, "Keep on men, she's through!"</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                With victory in the air, and justice in their hearts<br>
                they steeled themselves for the last<br>
                Broken and bloody, spent and torn<br>
                they readied themselves for Vox's final blast.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                A sudden strike from behind, <br>
                and a bash with Ulikian grace <br>
                Vox was stunned and slightly off<br>
                And unable to dodge the strike of a magic mace</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Armored scales cracked, and flesh was exposed<br>
                Willard dove head-first, ignoring his pain<br>
                And into her chest, his sword did plunge<br>
                in that instant, Vox was slain.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                A CHEER rose up! The gathered heroes rejoiced <br>
                for history had been made that day<br>
                A momument to their power and wisdom<br>
                which would stand dispite what any would have to say.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                The Dragon now dead, the curse was lifted<br>
                and Kalaran joined once again<br>
                With one voice the heroes now hailed their Captain<br>
                for his leadership, 'Dragonsbane'!</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                With joy in the air, the clerics begain working<br>
                on beseeching their gods to restore their companions' lives <br>
                And soon the dead heroes rejoined their friends<br>
                and in rejoicing each did strive.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Aradune himself came, clad in green armor and flaming sword<br>
                and with his godly might<br>
                Seven items of power were created<br>
                as a reward to those who fought that night.</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                Of such items, and the heroes <br>
                I can say but naught<br>
                For here my story ends,<br>
                for the battle has been fought</font> 
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                But think of this as days go by<br>
                and under setting sun, <br>
                Lizardmen, gnolls, and orcs have you down<br>
                know that with perserverence, in such a song you can be one.<br>
