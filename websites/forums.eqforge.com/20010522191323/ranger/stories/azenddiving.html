              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Having 
                died at the deepest part of the pool and leaving all his worldly 
                goods on his corpse Azend &#91;5th season at this time&#93; awakes 
                near the campfire of Surefall Glade. <br>
                <br>
                How can he ever hope to recover his lost wealth and equipment? 
                His corpse lies at the bottom of the pool and the pool at the 
                bottom of a great fall. What is worse the pool is at the lowest 
                point of Blackburrow and if he should have the huge fortune to 
                find it, the greater fortune to recover his belongings and the 
                unbelievable luck to evade the razor fish that inhabit the pool 
                then he will have to climb his way up through through the bowels 
                of his enemies&#39; camp. Leaving all this aside he resolves to 
                make an attempt and departs post haste for Blackburrow. Upon arriving 
                there he meets an old friend by the name of Vivian &#91;lev 10 
                Magician&#93; and her companion Tokusan 10th season ranger&#93; 
                so he asks for their assistance. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;I would help thee but I am afeared of dying myself&#34; says 
                Vivian &#34;Indeed my body already lies in the pool yet I know 
                of noone who has ever made it out alive&#34;. Not to be dissuaded 
                so easily, and indeed now relishing the challenge, Azend stands 
                at the head of the falls that plummet into the pool hundreds of 
                feet below and ponders his destiny briefly before plunging into 
                the chasm. &#91;hitting f9 and watching himself from a distance 
                for the full effect&#93; <br>
                <br>
                The blow as he hits the water removes all air from his lungs and 
                he breaks the surface briefly to recover before kicking to the 
                bottom as fast as he can. He realises now what Vivian was afraid 
                of as he spies bodies too numerous to count littering the floor 
                of the pool. Not daring to look around for the dreaded razorfish 
                lest it give the monster an opportunity to savage him he scans 
                the bottom of the pool, at last finding his body. Quickly he begins 
                removing all the equipment from it yet the items are too numerous, 
                the pool too deep and the air in his lungs is all but gone. He 
                hastily crams the items into his pack realising he has no time 
                to equip his shield and sword, let alone don his paltry armour. 
                As he fits the last item in he turns and kicks for the surface 
                with all his might and just as he thinks his lungs will surely 
                explode he is breating air again. &#91;We&#39;re talking last 
                pixel on the air gauge&#93; <br>
                <br>
                At this point he feels something tug at his leg then realises 
                that it is the razorfish which has just taken a large chunk out 
                of his thigh. Trying hard not to panic about the lack of any armour 
                or equipment he spins looking for a way to climb out of the pool, 
                strikes for shore and finally hauls himself from the mire bleeding 
                profusely and heaving for breath. He rests briefly to recover 
                his wits and then readies himself for the climb through this labyrinth 
                of evil. The climb is long and arduous and he encounters many 
                vicous Gnolls along the way, many of which he is far too weak 
                to contemplate engaging in battle although his rangers&#39; instinct 
                makes his blood boil at their mere existence. <br>
                <br>
                At last he emerges from the foul pit and is able to tell his friend 
                Vivian of his terrifying ordeal. She is amazed at his foolhardiness 
                but congratulates him all the same and he departs for the sanctity 
                of The Glade with a self-satisfied smile on his face.</font></p>
