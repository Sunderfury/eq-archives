              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                quest can be found in the Surefall Glade area from Corun Finisc. 
                In order to complete the quest, you must track and kill a VERY 
                rare spawn of a Gnoll Hunter. In my entire playing time, I have 
                seen only one and after slaying the beast, received the top of 
                the staff.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most 
                often, you will hear others in the area shouting for the part 
                of the staff they do not have, or they are willing to depart with 
                their portion for a tidy sum (Usually around 3 to 5 plat)</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
                you have succeeded in getting both parts of the staff, hail Corun 
                Finisc for him to put it together for you, give him both pieces 
                at the same time and he will reward you with the JaggedPine Crook.</font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Damage 
                5, Weight 8.5. +1 Strength, +5 HP, +5 protection from fire and

                Bow</b></font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                quest takes place in Kelethin. To begin, speak with Trueshot and 
                he will give you a pack to collect 4 items: treant wood from Freeport, 
                dwarven wire from Kaladim, spiderling silk, and a microservo from 
                Steamfont. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                Treant Wood can be obtained by speaking with Jyle Windshot, but 
                he will ask for a small lantern first. Be warned, there are TWO 
                Jyle Windshots in the area and one of them will try and rip you 
                off for the wood.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                Dwarven Wire can be tricky to get as you have to have a dwarf 
                speak with Tantor Everhot. Once you finally do speak with him, 
                you'll find he desires a Tumpy Tonic. Tumpy Irontoe is an infamous 
                bartender in Kaladim. Great you say, this isn't that bad, but 
                the problem is to make the Tonic he requires Kiola nuts (make 
                sure you buy two because you will need two tonics total.) Kiola 
                nuts, to my knowledge, are found on the Sister Island in the ocean 
                of Tears. In addidtion, you'll also have to provide Tumpy with 
                a flask of store-bought water (not foraged.) Give the two completed 
                tonics (separately) to Tantor and he wil give you the Dwarven 
                Wire.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                microservo can be found on various rogue clockwork beasties in 
                the land of Steamfont. They commonly roam around the windmills 
                in the zone.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
                in Steamfont go ahead and kill a few spiderlings to obtain the 
                spiderling silk neccessary.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                Once you have attained a high enough level (not sure if it is 
                related to level or fletching ability) you will receive a Treant 
                stave and instructions on how to make the bow. With this stave, 
                you can make the infamous Trueshot Bow! </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Stats 
                are 20 DAM, 45 Delay and 100 Range. Keep in mind, there are bows 
                better than this, but it doesn't cost you nearly as much for the 
                stave as say a darkwood stave... PLUS, it is a Ranger only weapon!</font></p>

                is the quest involving Gnasher Furgutt (level 8 or 9 gnoll in 
                Qeynos Hills.) Kill him, take his head and the note (Note: The 
                note will only appear during the deep night hours 9PM to 4AM or 
                so) on the corpse to Surefall Glade, and give to the ranger behind 
                the guild (standing by himself, his name is Larsk Juton.) He will 
                give you faction/experience/cash.Then when you give him the note 
                he gives it back to you and tells you to go see Captain Tillin 
                in S. Qeynos (same guy you give gnoll fangs to). </font></p>
              <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Give 
                Capt Tillin the note and he gives you cash and an Amulet of +5 
                charisma, then he calls the executioner to go kill the guy that 
                was dealing with the gnolls. You can follow her and watch the 
                execution if you want but its not necessary.</font></p>

                pawns and orc hatchetmen and bring them back to him. When you 
                bring two hatchets and give them to him at the same time he will 
                reward you with 4 - 5 tarnished weapons that you can use or sell.
