            <td height="707"> 
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Just 
                a bit of strategy for fellow rangers (and other classes in general) 
                when entering the Minotaur Caves. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">First 
                of all, don't enter solo unless you are least level 12. The weakest 
                minotaur (the slavers) will be very hard to defeat and you'll 
                be lucky to leave the cave without facing another one. Their levels 
                are such that even at level 15, I conned some minotaurs blue. 
                Also, very important to make sure that the minotaur just inside 
                the cave is not the minotaur hero. He's the kind of minotaur that 
                will rip your arm off, then proceed to beat you with it at level 
                30! He travels around the area outside, and I think he ends his 
                little tour of rampage there, just inside the cave entrance. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                you wind around the corner inside the entrance you'll see the 
                cave split into three parts, all very close to each other. Two 
                minotaurs make a patrol run from the middle to the left tunnel, 
                so be wary of both those two, and the single spawn points just 
                inside each of the three tunnels. You can quickly find yourself 
                being attacked by 3 minos in no time. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                area is a party's favorite ambush spot. It's marked by an abandoned 
                cart. Sending in one fast member of the party down into any of 
                the tunnels to get the minotaurs' attention and running back to 
                the cart is a good way of gaining exp, coins and loot. Especially 
                for the famed minotaur axe, which btw, is one about 1 in every 
                10 minotaurs. It's very random as to which mino has it. I've gotten 
                one from the very first mino inside the cave, and I've gotten 
                one from fairly well in the cave. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Lastly, 
                be careful about going too deep in the cave. Taking the right 
                tunnel will lead you quickly to the middle tunnel if you follow 
                its left wall. If you continue going deeper in the cave from the 
                right and middle tunnels, you are ok, till you make a U-turn, 
                then things get nasty. It's pretty much the same going just a 
                short distance in the left tunnel. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                is a very unpleasant NPC around this area who's a spellcaster 
                (Ed note: Meldrath the Malignant) and he's tough to even see much 
                less attack. They part that is difficult is that the walls are 
                very thin. The minotaurs can hit you through the walls if you 
                are standing right next to them. Not very 'realistic' but that's 
                the way it is. On top of this, the NPC is casting spells on you. 
                I've been hit with a disease cloud that eats at my HP, lost 50+ 
                hit points at a time with another spell, and sent on a rampage 
                after other PCs with yet another spell (charm.) All this at my 
                then level of 15. I think this nasty fellow is also guarded by 
                two minotaur guards (Ed note: They still con red to me at level 
                19) and they are much bigger than the other minos I've seen, but 
                I've only glanced at them, and not much beyond that. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Hope 
                to someday reach a level to handle the big boys there, but I think 
                if you play cautiously, there's good exp and loot to be found 
                for rangers with levels 12-15. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Good 
                luck and Good hunting, <br>
