                The sun had just risen in the Jagged Pine forest, this meant I 
                was late. For a Ranger must be ever on the watch for those who 
                would tarnish the sanctity of our home in search of the ever elusive 
                Mammoth, mother of all bears who walk the plains of Norrath. As 
                I fold up my tent and douse the fire that warmed me through the 
                night, I see the druid Tian. He has a gift for his future bride 
                Mirian and will pay me handsomely if I travel to Qeynos to retrieve 
                it for him. Checking my pouch and short on coins, I of course 
                accept the offer. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                traverse the dark cave and enter the Southern Hills of Qeynos, 
                where as usual all is in chaos. Looks like rain, come to think 
                of it, it always looks like rain in Norrath. All praise due to 
                Karana the Rainkeeper and Father of the storm. About to head onto 
                the road and a familiar smell hits me. Its the fragrance of the 
                candles used by the Monks to light the Dojos that they train in. 
                I turn around and follow the aroma, its Mafuyi. A kindred spirit 
                and close friend who has probably gotten me into more trouble 
                than he has gotten me out of. But such is life when you travel 
                as the wind... He has healed nicely from the wounds inflicted 
                upon him by my trusty sword when I was charmed by the evil necromancer 
                Varsoon. We laugh and muse of how one day soon Varsoon and his 
                blasted Skelton Pets will have their day in court. And on that 
                day I shall be the Judge, Jury and well you know the rest... </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It 
                seems a traveler was ambushed in Black Burrow by my most hated 
                of enemies the Gnolls; and needs assistance in the retrieval of 
                a few of her personals. A Rangers work is never done, we join 
                up and head to the stronghold to face our fates. We travel deep 
                into the wood and Egrim informs me that we must enter the cave 
                that leads to the heart of the Gnoll encampment and that many 
                have lost their lives and to not let my hatred lead me to folly 
                or death. I calmly nod in acknowledgment but the stench of Gnolls 
                is all around me and I feel my rage begin to boil. I shall not 
                sleep tonight if I do not quench my thirst for the spillage of 
                the blood of the mangy dogs. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                trek down into the abyss goes quite uneventful. Kill a Gnoll here, 
                kill a Gnoll there. hmmf a few silver pieces, hardly worth the 
                fight he put up. heh heh heh. With his belonging firmly in hand 
                we attempt to begin our descent, only to find that we are lost. 
                My natural tracking is almost useless in the underground caverns. 
                Oh how I long for the out of doors and the smell of the coming 
                rain. A crash behind us, the gnoll commander has entered into 
                the fray. Without thinking I react and pounce. Giving him all 
                I can muster, but alas it is not enough. Slash, slash, kick, slash, 
                concentrate. oof a blow to my skull, the blood rushes forth. I 
                stumble and feel my strenght fade, all is about to go black. suddenly 
                my strength is restored, no it has been fortified. I feel stronger 
                than I have ever felt before, what magiks have been bestowed upon 
                me? With renewed strength and the aid of my companions I press 
                on and slay the mighty beast. You will not have my soul today 
                Bertoxxulous. Ahh what is this we find? A nice spiked collar, 
                a leather bag, plenty of room for those long journeys across the 
                wastes and a bit of gold and I think I will take his scalp for 
                memories. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">A 
                moment to rest and then I think I will ask someone for assistance 
                in getting out of here. Imagine that me, a Ranger, Tracker extraordinaire 
                asking for help because I am lost, how profound. Oh, I almost 
                forgot, I must hurry, have to bring the statuette back to Tian 
                before dinner. Life is great and for another day I am still alive. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                I head to Qeynos I look back one last time at Black Burrow and 
                think, one day soon I will tear that place down. I will rain upon 
                it with the full might of the Jagged Pine Clan, with the force 
                of a raging Tempest. For nothing can stand in the way of Nature 
                gone mad... </font></p>
