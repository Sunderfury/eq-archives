              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
                started a few nights back when I decided my Combine Long Sword 
                was just not holding up against the my foes quit as well as I 
                would like. I needed something with more punch to bring the evil 
                I was facing to justice. After much debate I decided that I needed 
                to quest for a mighty two handed sword called the Bone Bladed 
                Claymore. As most already know this sword is the property on one 
                evil Troll Shadow Knight that makes his living in the lowest depths 
                of a dungeon called Befallen. To accomplish the task of dispatching 
                this vile creature I would need help, and lots of it. I called 
                on my closest brothers at arms, the holy Cleric, Walbort and the 
                most honorable Ranger, Rolin. We have fought many battles together 
                and I knew I could count on them when things got ugly. We all 
                meet at the entrance to the infamous Befallen, we had all been 
                here before, and we have all had our souls separated from us here 
                also. But we are older this time and wiser. We started by having 
                Rolin call upon his God to give us the agility of the cat, Walbort's 
                gave us the ability to move past the undead without being seen, 
                and mine endowed us with Holy Armor and Centered our minds for 
                the fight to come. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">All 
                set to bring or holy might down on this place of evil we entered. 
                The stench of the undead was almost unbearable, we used our keys 
                that where retrieved in earlier missions to gain access to the 
                lowest level of this god forsaken place. To our surprise we found 
                others down here sending these creatures home to Innoruuk. We 
                moved past the false wall and to the chamber of death where the 
                Troll does his work. Once again we found plenty of help around 
                us keeping the area cleared. This allowed us to concentrate on 
                our mission to separate this unholy Shadow Knight from his instrument 
                of destruction and turn it into a sword to slay his evil brethren. 
                When we came to the chamber we found that the Troll Shadow Knight 
                was off visiting with Innoruuk, (hatching some evil plan) and 
                we would have to wait for his return. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                we waited others would come to challenge the Troll but they would 
                yield to us, they knew our purpose you true and just. After waiting 
                for nearly two hour, (in real time) Rolin picked up the ugly Troll 
                Shadow Knight on his tracking, he must have smelled him out, and 
                he yelled, "Shadow Knight!" . We all ran to engage the evil beast 
                and the battle started with a roar! Rolin was the fist to get 
                to the Shadow Knight so it was really wanting to dispatch him, 
                try as it may it was all in vain, this night belonged to the just 
                and pure of heart. The Troll was no match for this veteran group, 
                he fell quickly and his greatly feared Harm Touch did him no good. 
                The rest of his horde fell quickly once their leader was slain.

              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
                removed my Bronze platemail helm to take a good look at the slaughter 
                that lay before my comrades, and I. I knelt down and removed the 
                Bone Bladed Claymore from the dead Troll, then made a vow that 
                from this day forth this sword shall be used only for good and 
                righteous cause. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It 
                was a lot of fun getting the BBC, I owe it all to Walbort and 
                Rolin, Thanks guys!! </font></p>
