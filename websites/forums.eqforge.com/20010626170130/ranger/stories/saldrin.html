                from Norrath</font></b> 
              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">"I 
                need to go home..." Saldrin thought to himself. He missed the 
                woods and trees of Surefall. He had spent many months among the 
                northmen of Halas - hunting the great Mammoths there. He'd learned 
                to speak their language and had come to feel a great sense of 
                kinship with them. "They are a people much like the land they 
                inhabit", he once told a friend, "they can be cold, harsh and 
                unforgiving, but they have a majesty and unique beauty as well. 
                Aye, and they can be very deadly - as can Everfrost." </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                was snapped out of his reminisces by a gust of cold wind. He shivered 
                and pulled his cloak tightly around his shoulders. "I'll go back 
                to Halas, bid my farewells and then I'm going home. Its been too 
                long", he thought. As he made his way back to Halas, he noted 
                an odd track in the snow. Closer inspection revealed its nature. 
                "Snow Trooper" he said to himself. He had fought them before and 
                felt a burning loathing for the vile Orcs. He took up the track. 
                The Orcs were not subtle creatures, easy to track - but they were 
                strong, tough adversaries. He caught up with the beast very near 
                a place the Barbarian hunters frequented. Undoubtedly this Orc 
                had in mind to harass the hunters, or find a lone traveller to 
                waylay. Unfortunately, this Orc "hunter" did not realise that 
                he was now the hunted. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Saldrin 
                readied his longsword and parrying dagger and began the incantation 
                for the spell "Flame Lick". He felt the magic well up and flow 
                through him as he completed his casting and felt a grim satisfaction 
                as the flames lept up around the vile creature. The orc charged. 
                Saldrin was taken somewhat by surprise by the speed at which the 
                orc moved through the snow. His sword had barely cleared its scabbard 
                when the orc was upon him. He avoided the beast's first blow, 
                easily ducking under the arc of the rusty broadsword the orc caried. 
                The Snow Trooper quickly followed with a hard punch that stunned 
                Saldrin momentarily. "This may be tougher than I anticipated", 
                he thought. Saldrin again attempted to cast the Flame Lick on 
                the Orc, but was struck by the orc's blade and he lost his concentration. 
                "Enough of that", he thought. He set his feet and went to work 
                with the fine steel longsword he carried. They traded blows for 
                several minutes and Saldrin slowly gained the upper hand. The 
                orc attempted to break and run. Saldrin quickly cast an ensnaring 
                spell. The orc, too injured to move in the spell's grasp, was 
                easily dispatched. A rusty broadsword and a few silver were all 
                that the Orc had carried. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Saldrin 
                took these, then kicked the orc's body down the slope of the hill 
                upon which they had fought. Saldrin then healed himself as best 
                he could with the minor healing spells he had learned during his 
                training at the guild hall in Surefall Glade. He was hurt worse 
                than he realised. He again pulled his cloak around him. Then set 
                out through the mist and snow for Halas - then home. </font></p>
