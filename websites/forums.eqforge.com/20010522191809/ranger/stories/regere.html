              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">‘Twas 
                raining this night when I broke my camp. I checked my supplies 
                and was sure I would have enough for some time. The water in my 
                pack and the rabbits I had snared would suffice for this hunting 
                night. Having just reached my fifth circle as a ranger the morning 
                before, I was becoming confident in my skills, and my bow as well. 
                I had just strung a fine one that morning, made from the limb 
                of the majestic elm, with a fine silken string, I was quite sure 
                it would serve me for some time to come. I was not of the skill&#40;OOC-47fletching&#41; 
                t&#39; craft this bow without help from Tunare herself, so I was 
                dually reassured &#39;twas a blessed weapon. <br>
                <br>
                With no real plan for this night of hunting, I merely wandered 
                the greater faydark, communing with Tunare, experiencing the lavish 
                woods of my homeland. In these meandering I happened upon a camp, 
                with a banner flying that I did not recognize. It had no foul 
                stench, other than some poorly cooked wolf, so my first thought 
                was that it belonged to something other than the orcs. It was 
                uninhabited at the moment so far as I could tell, so I decided 
                to check the sign around me for indication of passing. There were 
                scarce tracks indeed. I found what appeared t&#39; be a hide boot 
                print near a tree by the camp, and decided t&#39; follow. <br>
                <br>
                I was soon rewarded with the sounds of battle. Not far from the 
                camp, I happened upon a fellow elf, in a fray with a bandit of 
                some sort it would appear. He was in dire trouble t&#39; be sure. 
                While he had weakened the villain considerable&#40;OOC &#60;20%health&#41;, 
                he was taking more hits than delivering, and looked t&#39; be 
                meeting Tunare soon. Not while my bow was strung and my back not 
                broken! I broke t&#39; within arrow range and let loose a volley. 
                True t&#39; my instincts, the fine bow was blessed. The first 
                shot struck the bandit square, and left her reeling. I closed 
                as fast as my legs would carry me and swung my broadsword hard. 
                It met with a pleasant crunch as it met bone in the deep wound. 
                Upon my last return t&#39; my guildmaster upon reaching the fifth 
                circle, he suggested I may be ready for a new combat tactic. He 
                quickly taught me t&#39; kick my opponents effectively in battle 
                t&#39; gain the advantage. True t&#39; his teachings, I planted 
                a rawhide boot right t&#39; the midsection of the bandit, and 
                I was rewarded with an &#39;oomph&#39; as the wind was knocked 
                out of her. Just before she turned her attention upon me, she 
                planted one last blow with her dagger t&#39; the elf I was trying 
                t&#39; aid, and alas, he went down hard. With a quick glimpse, 
                I saw he was still breathing, in short, ragged breaths. He was 
                unconscious t&#39; be sure, but such is far better than dead under 
                any circumstances. <br>
                <br>
                I knew I had t&#39; work fast now, lest the bandit deal the killing 
                blow t&#39; him. I thought of trying t&#39; lead her away, but 
                feared she would just turn back upon him. I silently prayed t&#39; 
                Tunare for the soul of the fallen elf, &#39;Give a few moments 
                t&#39; him, that I may dispatch this wench and aid him&#39;. <br>
                <br>
                The bandit saw I was enraged having seen one of my kin fall, and 
                turned t&#39; make an attempted retreat, but her gods were not 
                watching this night. With her back t&#39; me, I made quick work 
                of her. Although it seemed as if she refused t&#39; die, she just 
                kept crawling away. I swung and missed several times, and repeatedly 
                kicked nothing but air, but in the end, she would fall t&#39; 
                my blade. <br>
                <br>
                I left the loot on her, as it was deservedly the prize of the 
                other elf. With that thought I felt a chill, turned and sprinted 
                back t&#39; where I watched him fall. He was still there, slowing 
                regaining his wits. I sat by him and tended t&#39; my many wounds, 
                lest I be unprepared for another ambush, with him in such a weakened 
                state, I knew he could be of no help. As he finally came around, 
                I was showered with thanks for my aid. I quickly dismissed such 
                pleasantries, as the danger was not completely gone. I advised 
                him t&#39; hide as best he could, and told him once he was concealed 
                from view. I stood watch until he was able t&#39; move, and escorted 
                him back t&#39; our village in the trees. <br>
                <br>
                Once back within the safety of the trees, we made our formal introductions. 
                He was Nighfyer, of the faydark champions. A fellow ranger t&#39; 
                be sure. He offered me a gift for my efforts, and despite repeated 
                refusals, he would eventually convince me t&#39; accept, citing 
                honor of a near fallen comrade, with which I could not dispute. 
                &#39;Twas a small wooden shield, of which I had seen him wield 
                in the battle. He had not just given me a gift, he had given me 
                part of his battle gear. I thanked him graciously, we shared blessings 
                of Tunare, and parted ways. <br>
                <br>
                I returned t&#39; my campsite. I chose this place carefully, so 
                t&#39; have a majestic view of the huts of Kelethin through the 
                mist each morning. Once prepared, I sat down t&#39; rest for the 
                day. Morning would break soon, and another night of hunting had 
                come t&#39; a close. I took out the shield, and etched the name 
                of the giver upon the outer edge with a dagger. Such a tale this 
                gift would tell. I shall not part ways with it methinks... <br>
