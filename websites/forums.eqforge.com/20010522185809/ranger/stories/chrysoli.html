              <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Mistmoore... 
                as vile a place as any in Norrath! While I&#39;d long harbored 
                hopes that this place might one day be swept clean of it&#39;s 
                evil taint, and had fought many a battle to that end, my resolve 
                to continue on with the struggle faltered as I turned to face 
                Mcgee. We stood together by a small pond. A clear pool that miraculously 
                remained untainted by the foul winds that swirled amid the battlements 
                of Lord Mistmoore&#39;s tower. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;I cannot stay any longer,&#34; I offered weakly. &#34;I feel 
                like I&#39;m going mad… I have to get away from here.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                It was a weak apology I knew. I was leaving my dear friend to 
                continue the fight alone, yet I didn&#39;t know how else to explain. 
                Another night of evil too intense... too far from home. I feared 
                if I lingered in that cursed place another second I&#39;d be driven 
                to madness. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;I have to get away from here… I have to find renewed purpose 
                to continue this fight,&#34; I said quietly. &#34;I just… have 
                to leave.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Then let&#39;s go,&#34; Mcgee answered without question. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Within hours, we were far from Mistmoore and running swiftly through 
                the hazy Lesser Faydark night. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Wait!&#34; I suddenly shouted and stopped abruptly. &#34;Mcgee...,&#34; 
                I faltered. Picking up my courage, &#34;Mcgee, I fear I&#39;m 
                only going to lead you into far greater dangers then those we 
                faced in Mistmoore. I have no destination in mind... in fact, 
                I haven&#39;t any idea where this journey will take me.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                I was making excuses... fumbling with words when in truth, I just 
                needed to run. To be alone with my thoughts... to visit again 
                the open plains of my homeland... to free myself of Mistmoore&#39;s 
                taint. In retrospect, I realize the arrogance inherent in thinking 
                I could better weigh the risks of a friendship&#39;s commitment. 
                None-the-less, I forged ahead. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Mcgee, rather then traipsing across the countryside with 
                me, you would be better served to stay in Mistmoore and acquire 
                additional experience. I simply cannot stay there any longer and 
                may not gather additional experience for some time. You could 
                do well in Mistmoore teaming with other adventurers and honing 
                your skills further.&#34; <br>
                <br>
                Though there was much truth to what I said, it still felt hollow… 
                a cheap panacea. Mcgee and I had been together since we first 
                adventured forth from our homes so long ago. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;I would be more of a hindrance... I do need more experience...&#34; 
                Mcgee started. <br>
                <br>
                I cringed. That was not the crux, nor the truth of the matter. 
                Yes, the gulf was widening between us, but it was only an artificial 
                barrier, one that determines one&#39;s ability to further their 
                fighting skills. I just needed a little time... <br>
                <br>
                I was lost for words. Hugging my dearest friend, I stepped back 
                and waved goodbye. <br>
                <br>
                &#34;We&#39;ll meet again soon! I&#39;ll send messages... I promise!&#34; 
                I said <br>
                <br>
                &#34;Goodbye for now then,&#34; Mcgee answered and then simply 
                asked, &#34;Chrys, don&#39;t get yourself killed?&#34; <br>
                <br>
                I smiled. &#34;Not me! I run too fast!&#34; <br>
                <br>
                As Mcgee turned to head back to Mistmoore, I ached all over inside, 
                a loneliness I hadn&#39;t known in years. Turning toward Greater 
                Faydark, I ran. For days on end I ran, with scant rest, trying 
                to purge the ugliness of Mistmoore from my heart and soul, until 
                finally, exhausted, I collapsed on the dock in Butcherblock Mountains. 
                Freeport, then home, was but a brief ocean voyage away. <br>
                <br>
                The voyage, thankfully, was uneventful and the time onboard was 
                spent sampling various liquors and brews collected while traveling 
                the many different lands in Norrath. Docking in Freeport was similarly 
                uneventful and feeling refreshed, I immediately started my overland 
                journey toward the home of some friends in Rivervale. <br>
                <br>
                Rivervale! What a unique little town. While a Halfling town for 
                sure, it&#39;s seemed to have grown to become a major way-stop 
                between east and west. A gathering place of different races and 
                cultures. I stayed long enough for a night&#39;s rest, a bit of 
                banking, re-supplying and a cheery local resident bound me to 
                that fair burg. After the night&#39;s rest, I knew my destination 
                and was anxious to see the plains of home again. But more then 
                anything, I wondered if ogres still soiled my homeland with their 
                presence in West Karana. I decided to scout out the area and see 
                if they&#39;d been driven off... or not. <br>
                <br>
                On this, my second scouting trip to those lonely desolate reaches 
                where ogres had dared set camp in my beloved West Karana, I approached 
                once again from the north, cautious as before, yet determined 
                to sneak a little closer then my previous journey. To my disgust, 
                from a good distance away, I could see clearly this was no deserted 
                camp! I decided then and there to better determine the make up 
                of this camp. I threw up camo and started skirting the camp to 
                the east. <br>
                <br>
                From this new vantage point, I found I still couldn&#39;t get 
                a good look at what type of pet Chief Goonda had with him, so 
                I headed around to the south of the camp, hoping for a clearer 
                view. Though I was a considerable distance from the camp, Chief 
                Goonda apparently has excellent long range vision and saw through 
                my camo. <br>
                <br>
                My first warning of an attack was a frost spell that slammed into 
                me and drained near a third of my life! Fortunately, Eluno, a 
                close Druid friend who I&#39;d met earlier in East Karana, had 
                cast Spirit of the Wolf on me and without hesitation, I took off 
                sprinting to the south. I knew I could never hope to stand against 
                this entire ogre camp and swiftly I ran, an untimely abort to 
                this scouting mission. <br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately, Chief Goonda had other ideas and I&#39;d barely 
                made five strides into my escape before I withered in agony as 
                another spell tore through me. I stumbled and faltered. Badly 
                injured from Goonda&#39;s last spell, my steps were tentative 
                and my strength failing. <br>
                <br>
                Those were rapid spell casts! Though gravely wounded, I forced 
                my tired legs onward and somehow found the will to resist a third 
                spell &#40;surely that would have been my doom&#41;. I made a 
                good twenty paces... then thirty... a faint hope flared! I just 
                might yet outrun deaths&#39; cruel reach. <br>
                <br>
                Ah, a fleeting thought is was though as Goonda quickly closed 
                the distance between him and I. His first blow to my back crushed 
                me... leaving me barely able to move. Staggering back into motion, 
                I made a few more steps then stopped. The cold realization that 
                there&#39;d be no escaping my fate this night took hold. <br>
                <br>
                Clearing my mind of all other thoughts, I quickly surveyed the 
                surrounding location. Calm now, bloodied and battered, I slowly 
                turned around to face my adversary. I was determined to land at 
                least one blow in my defense... and that I did! Forsaking all 
                thoughts of escape, I lashed out at him with every ounce of my 
                remaining strength and mana. <br>
                <br>
                Every reserve I had I threw at him, mindlessly... recklessly... 
                a berserker frenzy upon me. Blow upon blow I rained down upon 
                him and with each successful attack, Goonda&#39;s rage only seemed 
                to intensify while a fearful toll was being exacted on my own 
                slight frame. One final blow I struck, then Goonda screamed his 
                outrage. My waning life trickled away... my arms, in the end, 
                too heavy to lift in my own defense... I watched helplessly, yet 
                defiant, as Chief Goonda struck out with a mighty punch that crumpled 
                me to my knees... and sent my spirit fleeing back to Rivervale... 
                Mcgee&#39;s parting request echoing faintly in the Karana breeze.
