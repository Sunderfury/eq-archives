                from Norrath</font></b>
              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
                The screams and howls echoed off every surface as he fled down 
                the corridor, turning this way and that in a mad rush. The stone 
                walls, dark and damp, reflected the sounds in such a way that 
                trying to locate their source was almost fruitless. And to Aziraphale, 
                they all looked very much alike as he ran for his life. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Blood 
                covered his leather tunic and dripped heavily off of the blade 
                of his two-handed sword. A lot of the blood was Gnoll, but his 
                deep wounds were adding much of his own to the mix. His breath 
                came in heaving gasps as he tried to increase the distance from 
                his pursuers. He was beginning to feel dizzy from the blood loss, 
                and the smell in this dungeon was rank enough to enhance the effect 
                - his sensitive olfactory nerves, most useful for a ranger, were 
                almost reeling from the strong stench. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                slid on a patch of moss and bounced off a sharp corner, grunting 
                in pain. He slowed for a moment, and felt hot breath down the 
                back of his neck. Moments later a powerful claw swiped across 
                his cloak, adding a new tear to the already almost shredded garment. 
                It bit deeply into the leather tunic and intense pain slammed 
                through him, slowing him further. Turning into a larger cavern, 
                he jumped down a small embankment and ducked a small outcropping. 
                The satisfying sound of a thud came from behind and he was sure 
                it was the thick skull of the Gnoll Guardsmen chasing him. Or 
                at least one of them anyway - he dare not look back to see how 
                many were now in pursuit. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                and Lyonnoch had become separated in the earlier melee and he 
                carried the additional worry of his friend. The bard was not quite 
                as strong as he was, though the songs he could carry into battle 
                often made one feel braver and more powerful than usual. He hoped 
                his friend had made it up to the surface - to the relative safety 
                of the entrance to this hell. If only Aziraphale could get up 
                top he thought he might have half a chance… </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                finally spied some familiar ground and the sight of it gave his 
                heart a boost. He quickened his pace to an almost dangerous gate 
                - one false step and he could fall; and that would spell a quick 
                death. Throughout his flight he passed many faces, some of which 
                he’d seen on the way down. Almost all were engaged in battles 
                of their own; help would not come from them this day. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                bounded across a wooden bridge and turned left, or tried to. At 
                the full run he was doing he couldn’t quite negotiate the turn 
                and banged hard off the far wall. The corridor leading up to the 
                outside was narrow and steep - his energy was bleeding off fast. 
                Something much smoother than a claw sliced into his right leg 
                and felled him. Turning he saw that an Elite Gnoll had joined 
                the pursuit - it’s sword now coated with Aziraphale’s blood. Hope 
                faded quickly, but his faith in Tunare glowed brightly as ever. 
                He would not go down easily. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Summoning 
                his remaining strength, he brought his mighty two-handed sword 
                down into the crowd of dog-like beasts before him. He connected 
                well enough to knock the leaders off balance, and the steep pitch 
                of the corridor did the rest. The pack fell back several feet 
                and Aziraphale leapt on the chance. He turned back up the corridor 
                and charged as hard as ever for the top. Three or four turns later 
                and he could see the light peeking through the cracks in the door 
                that marked the entrance to the den. But the door opened inward 
                and he knew the damn creatures were only seconds behind…he softly 
                cursed his rotten luck. Suddenly the light blossomed as an unwary 
                adventurer threw open the portal. Though he did not think he had 
                the air for it, Aziraphale took his last deep breath and shouted 
                as loud as he could manage:</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                “WARE! GNOLLS COMING UP!” </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                barely caught a glimpse of the stunned look on the face of the 
                newcomer as he flew by out into the open, sweet air. As he turned 
                the final left and sprinted with all his might for the opening 
                that would lead him from this place, he was struck harder than 
                ever from behind. Collapsing, he knew he would not make those 
                last few yards, and the bitterness it left in his mouth was almost 
                worse than the coppery taste of blood. As he fell to the ground, 
                he tried to turn to face his foes. He would not die with his back 
                to these bastards! </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Without 
                warning, a blue glow engulfed him and he felt several of his wounds 
                close…another chance! He could take no time to look upon his savior; 
                a kind-hearted healer he assumed. With his renewed strength he 
                tried to bolt once again for the exit, but his stamina had been 
                severely sapped; and the gap too far to bridge before the mangy 
                curs would cut him down for the last time. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Yet 
                once again the gods were to smile upon young Aziraphale. More 
                merciful help than any Half-elf deserved in one day - from out 
                of nowhere the sweet sounds of a mandolin. Not just any sounds, 
                and not just any mandolin. He instantly recognized the music as 
                being Lyonnoch’s, and the song was Selo’s Accelerado. The notes 
                swept across the air and resonated almost magically through Aziraphale’s 
                body. His feet now felt swifter than ever and he wasted not one 
                moment in fleeing towards the opening ahead. The music meant one 
                thing, that Lyonnoch lived; and this knowledge bolstered Aziraphale 
                enough to provide him that final ounce of courage and willpower. 
                The exhausted and near mortally wounded ranger half flew, half 
                fell across the hidden border over which he knew the Gnolls would 
                not pass. While dangerous, they lacked any great intellect and 
                seemed to stay within a confining perimeter for the most part. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                Aziraphale lay there on the cool stone surface, he knew that he 
                would live to return to Black Burrow…and with Tunare’s good grace, 
                he would repay the Gnolls for their savagery with unbridled hatred 
                and cold steel.</font></p>
