              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>STEP 
                1:</b> You start to train in fletching by first purchasing a fletching 
                kit and putting at least one practice point into the skill of 
                fletching at your guild. One hint that I have heard of is that 
                if your a level 20 character and you put one practice point into 
                fletching, you will be made a level 20 fletcher. If you a level 
                10 character and you put one point into fletching you will be 
                a level 10 fletcher. Optional things you can buy are the books 
                on fletching and bowery that the merchants have. I have never 
                been completely sure if these are needed or not. So buy them at 
                your own descretion.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">And 
                one other thing about using practice points, eventually you will 
                reach a level 20 or 21 and the guildmaster will tell you that 
                the remainder of your training must be done in the field, in other 
                words, get out the fletching kit and fletch.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                new flecthing kit has 8 slots while the older kit had 4. They 
                only weigh .4 so I use them instead of backpacks. BUT, be careful 
                not to hit the combine button, as you will combine everything 
                in the backpack and will lose it all.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>STEP 
                2: </b>Purchase 20 bundles of each of the 4 parts needed for making 
                arrows from a vendor that sells arrow parts. Start with the cheapest: 
                Field points, Wooden Shafts, Round Fletches and Large Nocks. These 
                will cost about 5 to 6 copper for a bundle, and a bundle produces 
                5 arrows if you're successful. So your first attempts will cost 
                4 X 5 or 6 copper, equaling 20 to 24 copper for 5 arrows. The 
                only thing that will cause your cost of materials to go up or 
                down is your personal CHR value and possibly how you’re greeted 
                by the vendor. I have discovered that any level of CHR over 105 
                is wasted as you get no cheaper price with higher CHR, although 
                I only tried CHR 115 and saw no increase. If you discover that 
                a higher level of CHR gets you a cheaper price, please let me 
                know. Later when you make arrows and sell them back to the merchants 
                a high level of CHR will also get you the best price from the 
                vendor.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>STEP 
                3:</b> Now place one, and only one (Ed Note: You can select one 
                part by holding down your CONTROL key when you click,) of each 
                of the 4 parts into the fletching kit and press the combine button. 
                As you fletch you will have two different things happen. The first 
                is that you will either succeed and make 5 arrows or you will 
                get a message saying that you lacked sufficient skill to make 
                that item. If you get this message do not stop. Just keep trying. 
                You will see this message a lot, but keep making arrows. The other 
                thing that might happen is that you might receive an increase 
                in your level at fletching. It may seem funny but you can fail 
                at making a bundle of arrows and still get an increase in your 
                level at fletching.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each 
                player has a certain level of INT and WIS. These values were determined 
                at the time that you created your character. Each of these values 
                affects your training in the following way. A higher WIS gives 
                you a better chance of succeeding at making arrows instead of 
                getting that message, &quot;You lack the required skill….&quot;. 
                A higher value of INT gives you a higher chance of getting an 
                increase in your level at fletching. These attributes can be increased 
                with equipment that has INT or WIS enhancements, like a Savants 
                cap. Or, you can purchase INT and WIS increasing jewelery.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>STEP 
                4:</b> Continue making arrows with these cheapest parts until 
                you see the message that these arrows are now TRIVIAL.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
                these early arrows you can either use them or sell them to other 
                archers. These early arrows will have a damage value of 1 and 
                a range of 50. They are better than store bought arrows and can 
                be sold for at least 1 silver per arrow, if not more. However, 
                selling arrows can take a considerable amount of time and you 
                may just prefer to use them to increase your archery level. If 
                you are a class that cannot use a Bow, what the heck are you doing 
                fletching. I know you can, but I ask, WHY?? A good archer is a 
                better salesman of bows and arrows than a non-archer.</font></p>
