              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The 
                Wandering</b> </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">For 
                the first 12 levels of my life, I was petrified of the idea of 
                being far enough away from my homelands that I would have to change 
                my bindpoint from my beloved Surefall Glade, and the friends of 
                the forest therein. But actions forced my hand one day. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">While 
                walking through nearby Qeynos on a quest to save our Ambassador 
                Gash Flockwalker from the vile Unkempt Druids, I noticed that 
                about half the Guards of fair Qeynos considered by amiably while 
                the other half glowered dubiously. I figured out that it was the 
                faction and the dubious Guards were the gnoll-loving corrupt guards. 
                Being a member of the Noble Surefall Rangers I felt it my duty 
                to introduce these corrupt pigs to my axe. Little did I know that 
                this would change my life. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                a while of ridding fair Qeynos from its oppressors, the Corrupt 
                Guards changed from dubious to all out hatred and began attacking 
                me on sight. With multiple guards jumping me whenever I entered 
                the city I found it impossible to make it to the bank or any where 
                else which the rural Glade could not offer. Faced with this dilemma 
                I took a last glace at my beloved homeland and, with a kind Halfling 
                Druid friend, packed to leave for his town of Rivervale. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                a long and dangerous trek through East Karana and the Gorge of 
                King Xorbb, much of which was done while camoed and following 
                a tree, we entered Rivervale to the joyous music of the Halflings. 
                Looking for something to hunt, we undertook a journey to Beholder 
                Maze and punished some Gorge Minotaurs and Muddites (Muddites 
                who, by the way, drop valuable ore for us smiths out there) who 
                dared to oppose the Guardians of the Vale. The kind Halflings 
                kindly took to me and, after many labors to prove my worth, awarded 
                me the Squad Ring as an honorable Deputy and Guardian of the Vale. 
                </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                entire situation however had taught me to overcome the fear of 
                travel and a disdain for cities which I had never felt before. 
                I then vowed to wander the riches of all lands under the blessing 
                of Karana and, with my good Druidic friend took off for Faydwer 
                and the lands of the Noble Full Elven people. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We 
                decided to take a quick trip to Chrushbone, which, hehe after 
                5 hours of not so quick killing, we both left carrying fabled 
                Shiny Bronze Shields. ( On a side note, not to be a traitor to 
                my race but Wood Elven women are the most beautiful women in Norrath! 
                )</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
                that, the wandurlust hit again and the two of us took off for 
                the Minotaur caves of Steamfont. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">And 
                is where my story ends as I, formerly Rogosh of Surefall, am now 
                on a quick stopover in Steamfont, fighting Minotaurs and the various 
                interesting flying creatures around in service to King Ak'Anon. 
                But who knows where the next hunting grounds may be found....
