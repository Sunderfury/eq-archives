        is an informational guide to the Ivy Etched Ranger only armor. This contains

        I did all of my own questing (in other words, did not buy the armor pieces). 
        For the <br>
        most part, I solo’ed much of it. This ment I got it a lot later then most 
        rangers. I want to say <br>
        right now that I couldn’t have done a LOT of it without the help of one 
        of my best friends, and <br>
        favorite grouping partner, -Rat, best druid on the MT server (nick name, 
        not game name). <br>
        Because it was just the two of us, or me alone, death came many times, 
        and you have to either <br>
        face it, or end up buying the armor. I have also posted them in the order 
        that I got them, though <br>
        may not be the easiest, but is at least close. The prices on the jewels 
        listed are what I get as a <br>
        wood elf in Kelethin with base 75 Cha. <br>
        <br>
        On each part, I will be posting sites to EqAtlas and Illia’s Everquest 
        Bestiarty. The <br>
        maps are a great help if you do not know the area, or if you just want 
        an overview. The <br>
        information on each monster is sometimes off a bit (maybe off a level 
        or two) but I used it for <br>
        the Ivy Etched and found it to be very close and very helpful. <br>
        <br>
        NOW, that all the stuff out of the way, lets get to the info-- <br>

        (X2) Ivy Bracer- <br>
        Redwind- 27 <br>
        Aqua Goblin Tidal Lord- 24 <br>
        Fire Emerald- 97 platinum <br>
        <br>
        Redwind <br>
        <a href="http://eqatlas.com/everfrostmap.html" target="_blank">http://eqatlas.com/everfrostmap.html</a> 
        <br>
        <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=657" target="_blank">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=657</a> 
        <br>
        <br>
        Redwind is considered a shadowknight. Because of this, he has harm touch. 
        For those <br>
        of you that don’t know, that means 99% of the time, he will open up with 
        a direct magic based <br>
        attack (resistible, but rarely). At 30, his HT did a bubble of damage 
        to start out with. He also <br>
        likes to use the darkness series of SK spells (slows (like snare) the 
        target, and also DoT’s them) <br>
        and will fear from time to time. When I killed him long ago, he did not 
        have a pet, I have heard <br>
        that now he does. SK pets are always very weak, and are most of the time 
        easy to ignore, or <br>
        easily rooted and finished off in no time after the SK is dead. From my 
        experience, Redwind <br>
        always drops the Rune of Ivy needed for the bracer. Using harmony on the 
        other orcs is a very <br>
        effective move, only Redwind will come if used correctly. He can be solo’ed 
        in the mid 30s <br>
        without much problems (this was before rangers got sow at 30 mind you, 
        probably even easier <br>
        now), or a group of mid to high 20s could kill him (as many people often 
        group up, and will <br>
        need an enchanter, ranger, or druid to harmony/mez, so as a ranger, you 
        will be gladly <br>
        accepted). <br>
        <br>
        Aqua Goblin Tidal Lord <br>
        <a href="http://eqatlas.com/dagnormap.html" target="_blank">http://eqatlas.com/dagnormap.html</a> 
        <br>
        <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=267" target="_blank">http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=267</a> 
        <br>
        <br>
        If you are able to kill Redwind, the Tidal Lord should be no problem. 
        I kited him as <br>
        crudely as a Ranger can (in contrast to our druid friends.) I snared him 
        and ignited him as long <br>
        as I had mana. He would concisely shoot arrows as I casted, stopping to 
        do it as well. Stopping <br>
        in his tracks to hit me for 1, as I hit him for 37. He was running before 
        I was even out of mana, <br>
        and only needed to melee him as he was running, only because it was much 
        faster then ignite. <br>
        Any ranger that has killed Redwind can kill a Tidal Lord solo, or with 
        any healing partner (druid <br>
        preferred, for help with snare, and damage assistance, along with buffs, 
        and thorns). Also, <br>
        careful kiting this guy as the land here is rough and a sharp fall can 
        kill you. There is a goblin <br>
        camp outside the “hallway” to Unrest. If things go bad, stay near there, 
        so you have a zone to <br>
        run to for safety. Also, you can almost always find a nice soul to help 
        you that has just been <br>
        trained out of Unrest. <br>

        Ivy Helm- <br>
        Tarskuk- 33 <br>
        A Deathly Usher- 31 <br>
        Sapphire- 114 platinum <br>
        <br>
        Tarskuk <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Tarskuk is a named cyclops. As you might have learned, all the “bigger” 
        races run as <br>
        fast as Sow. Tarskuk is suppose to run faster then Sow. When I was level 
        34, my friend Rat <br>
        (druid) (who I also remember as 34) and I killed him. I melee’ed while 
        Rat healed and nuked <br>
        him down. When it was over, we won, and the necklace was there for looting. 
        So far, out of the <br>
        4 times I have killed him, he dropped the necklace 3/4 times. I am not 
        sure if I was lucky, or if <br>
        that is the normal rate, but that is it as far as I know. Tarskuk was 
        quite easy to get to spawn. <br>
        Kill all of the lizards, skellys, and cyclops around the gypsy camp near 
        the Lake Rathe zoneline. <br>
        When I did that, he always spawned quickly after a few clearings of the 
        area. <br>
        <br>
        A Deathly Usher <br>
        <a href="http://eqatlas.com/mistmooremap.html" target="_blank">http://eqatlas.com/mistmooremap.html</a>

        <br>
        <br>
        The Usher was found most commonly for me in the Jail area. There are a 
        lot of spawns <br>
        in this area sometimes, and it can get crazy. We had a few deaths (Rat 
        and myself, out of a <br>
        group of 4) from a train. If you have trouble getting a group, there are 
        2 spawns in room number <br>
        14 that you can camo into (from the EqAtlas site posted above), if you 
        can manage to hamony <br>
        pull or root park one, you should be able to hold the room (watch for 
        trains) until you get the <br>
        Usher. Also, MM is one of the most often trained zones. If you stay camo’ed 
        (undead can see <br>
        though camo, beware this) at the zoneline, trash is always trained to 
        the zone, if you watch, <br>
        Ushers will almost always come with the deep trains. If someone takes 
        out the train, the rune <br>
        could drop off them, and if you ask nicely, they might let you loot (is 
        NODROP by the way). <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Meldrath is one of the meanest little buggers of the Ivy Etched armor. 
        He’s a 35 necro, <br>
        and necros are almost always underconned. Also, Meld is almost always 
        with 2 mino guards, <br>
        and he also has a pet. I got the tunic early, I was only level 28, and 
        a good friend of mine (thank <br>
        you Harmonious) told me they were pulling Meld. I quickly sent a tell 
        to Rat, and was flown <br>
        from the WC ring to BB (as close as Rat could port at the time) and tried 
        to get there before the <br>
        skull rotted. I didn’t make it, but stayed to help Harm and his friends 
        in a hope that Meld would <br>
        spawn again. He did and Harm and his group killed Meld and his guards 
        while I tried my best <br>
        just to be helpful by killing Meld’s pet. A group of mid to high 30s should 
        be able to take Meld, <br>
        make sure and have a healer, and an enchanter is recommended. <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Thistle is a named brownie, but quite easy compared to some of the mean 
        brownies in <br>
        the area. Many people have different thoughts to get him to spawn. What 
        always works for me <br>
        is just watching tracking. I got him on track before the tracking patch, 
        and could only track 20 <br>
        spawns. Now that there is a scroll bar, if he is up, you will know. You 
        can just watch from a <br>
        zoneline, be careful of the brownies, and I recommend waiting, traveling, 
        or anything else <br>
        camo’ed, as the brownies can’t see though camo, and you will have the 
        upper hand. Thisle is <br>
        only 25, but if you go up against Thistle without proper readiness, you 
        might die. My suggested <br>
        way of killing Thistle is keeping yourself fully buffed, and watching 
        tracking (while camo’ed). <br>
        When you see him pop,(or wait to buff till now, but if he spawns, druids 
        will quickly take him <br>
        down for the cords he drops) so quickly, refresh sow and camo, and track 
        him...when you see <br>
        him, cancel magic him until his thorns drop. This will take off his AC, 
        HPs, Sow, and damage <br>
        shield buffs. After that, save your kicks for his healing, and watch for 
        those insane DDs. Rat and <br>
        I were 30 and we took him down with ease. On the way out, a brownie killed 
        Rat in one cast, <br>
        so I suggest camo’ing to leave, or porting out as soon as you get your 
        rune. <br>

        (X2) Star Ruby- 74 platinum (each) <br>

        Grimfeather <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Grimfeather is one of the banes of NK. He is a named griffon, and flies 
        faster then (or at <br>
        least close) to sow. I know that Grimfeather once caught Rat and I at 
        the NK ring, and killed us <br>
        both (both sow’ed) before we had a chance to do anything. (I panicked 
        and ran like heck, <br>
        thank you Rat for trying to save me.) I got the rune by passing though 
        and someone had killed <br>
        Grimfeather, and the rune was going to rot, so I took the rune and kept 
        it in my bank forever. I <br>
        didn’t get around to solo’en Grimfeather till 40. When I was level 40 
        is when the hybrid spell <br>
        patch was added. We got panic animal, and using that, I could easily solo 
        Grim at 40. I would <br>
        still be Full life, and 60% mana. my method was to freshly sow myself, 
        snare Grim, panic <br>
        animal, beat on Grim, and keep fear on him at all times. When he gets 
        to about 50% life, I <br>
        suggest a re snare, for if you let snare brake, he will be flying at top 
        speeds away from you. <br>
        Keep it up and with only needing to cast snare and fear, you will come 
        out on top. I’m sure he <br>
        can be grouped much earlier then 40, just use the fear method (a druid 
        with the upgraded fear <br>
        spell will be helpful as well, for they also have snare, and sow to help 
        out, not to mention the <br>
        buffs and the healing). <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        These wizards (and you need the inferno, not the others, and you must 
        get the wizard, <br>
        not the others) spawn all over the southern end of SolA. Where I had my 
        luck was taking the <br>
        bar room, and holding it waiting on a wizard. In the end, I saw a wizard 
        and I guess the <br>
        excitement caused me to not think, for I pulled a whole slew of goblins. 
        Rat and I were about <br>
        mid 30s, and we killed the wizard, I looted the heart, and then promptly 
        died, split seconds <br>
        away from the evac going into effect. Rat and I went back and collected 
        me, and I dusted off <br>
        the rune in my bank, and headed to Kithicor. SolA is a playground for 
        anyone 40+. As you <br>
        learn how to get around in SolA, and such, makes it much easier. <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Wiltin is a pain to many rangers. But if you know these simple things, 
        he’s not that bad <br>
        at all. Wiltin’s place holder is - A Buccaneer -. Now, here is the fun 
        part. Most monster’s <br>
        PH’er need to be killed to get your spawn. Do your best to protect this 
        guy. Every everquest <br>
        day, at 8AM game time, he will despawn, and at 10AM, he will spawn as 
        either another <br>
        buccaneer, or Wiltin. Wiltin is suppose to despawn shortly after spawning. 
        I’m not sure about <br>
        that, but don’t take any chances. If the buccaneer is killed, it takes 
        about 2 EQ days to get <br>
        anything (buccaneer or Wiltin). So if he dies, expect a longer wait. There 
        is a safe little inlet of <br>
        land that you can sit on. If you look at the camp and put the boat path 
        behind you, and Gornit to <br>
        your right, you can safely sit there for RL hours. Nothing heads there, 
        and you can watch the <br>
        spawn from there without any problems. The quiver off Wiltin is a container, 
        so make sure you <br>
        have room in your inventory for a container, not an item. He wasn’t that 
        hard at 42 solo. <br>

        These are pretty mean. I suggest taking a healer with you. I solo’ed them 
        at 41 and 42. <br>
        I say that because when I first walked out there, I saw one, and killed 
        it, got the first of the six <br>
        arrows. I then tried to kill another, and was killed and de leveled back 
        to 41. The way to get <br>
        these to spawn is to go to the pixie tower, and slaughter them, just run 
        around killing everything <br>
        in the area around the tower, and keep track up. The SECOND they spawn, 
        get to them fast <br>
        (stay fully buffed, you don’t have time to buff when you see them) start 
        cancel magic’ing them <br>
        until they lose their thorn shield. If you catch them early, they will 
        only have one to no buffs on, <br>
        and you can spend more time hitting, and less time casting. Stay near 
        the tower doing this, and <br>
        stay camo’ed as you do, so you get the upper hand, and don’t get jumped 
        by one. You need <br>
        one of each of the arrows. They all have different names. Arrow of _______. 
        After getting all 6, <br>
        put them in the quiver, and hit combine. It only took me 8 brownies to 
        get the 6 arrows. From <br>
        the 8 I killed, they all dropped arrows and only had two arrow doubles. 
        I believe I just had <br>
        good luck with that. I suggest taking a friend ranger who understands 
        that as long as he/she <br>
        helps, he/she can have all the doubles, saving him/her trouble later.

        <br>
        <br>
        This quest is one of the most annoying of the Ivy quest. You have to deal 
        with faction, <br>
        and lots of little chores. Rathmana is not for killing, and judging by 
        his level, I wouldn’t <br>
        recommend trying it any ways. Rathemana is on the faction of the Temple 
        of Sol Ro. For the <br>
        boots you need only 3 things. Ronium, MM granite, and cash. Sounds easy?...nope. 
        If you are <br>
        willing to sit in EC auctioning for Ronium, and don’t mind buying it, 
        do that. A lot faster, and in <br>
        the end, a lot safer. Also, if you get the Ronium yourself, you will lower 
        faction to possible ‘kill <br>
        on site’ to the gnomes of Ak’anon. But as much work as it took, I don’t 
        think I would part with <br>
        a piece of ronium for less then 250+ platinum. Maybe it was because I 
        did most of it solo, <br>
        maybe it’s just because I never seen Ronium for sale, but they are not 
        that fun to obtain. Rath is <br>
        the first of the people you can use to raise faction with. Give this guy 
        30 GOLD until he is <br>
        amiable faction. This will mean that the Temple of Sol Ro will be amiable 
        faction as well. Then <br>
        you can move on to the next part. <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        Once you are amiable faction with Rathmana you will be amiable faction 
        with Lord <br>
        Searfire. Ask him, “What about ronium” and he will give you a NODROP cauldron. 
        This is <br>
        what you will need for the ronium. It is a 6 slot container, and the 6 
        items needed are; <br>
        -Two Bars of Enchanted Platinum (store bought platinum bars, enchanted 
        by a 34+ level <br>
        enchanter.) <br>

        This is another NPC like Rathmana who is not part of the quest other then 
        used for <br>
        raising faction. Giving this dwarf 4 bone chips will raise faction with 
        the North Kaladim residents <br>
        (including Priestess Ghalea who you need). I filled a back pack of bone 
        chips (yes, that means <br>
        100+ bone chips) to give to this dwarf. It barley did it. I suggest /auction’ing 
        to buy them off the <br>
        newbies while you sit at the chess board killing the skellys for the chips. 
        After you fill a pack, <br>
        turn them in, 4 at a time, to Gunlok. Keep con’ing him till he is amiable, 
        then you can move on <br>
        to the next part. <br>

        This is a sub-quest, in this sub quest, for the ronium, for the boots 
        (tired yet?). When <br>
        she will talk to you, with will give you a bag with 4 slots to fill. What 
        you need is four ‘faerie <br>
        dusts’ from the faeries that fly around in Lesser and Greater Faydark. 
        Here is the clincher. The <br>
        faeries are also for a quest for the “Enchanted Trueshot Longbow” (Aka 
        the Raincaller). If you <br>
        kill the faeries, you will not be able to do the Raincaller quest. Now, 
        if you don’t care, then <br>
        slaughter the faeries. If you do, then your options are limited. I happen 
        to have a few other <br>
        characters I play. I got my level 21 necro and paid a ranger to track 
        them down. Collected the <br>
        dust and then transferred it to my ranger. You can either have a friend 
        kill them, and you track <br>
        them, pay for the dust, or do something like I did. Either way, good luck.

        *These are the highest level faeries of Greater Faydark, and have the 
        largest percentage <br>
        of a chance of dropping the dust you need. (Make note that you need faerie 
        dust, and not pixie. <br>
        Looks white instead of yellow.) Get four of these, and combine it in the 
        pouch given to you from <br>
        Priestess Ghalea. Combine the pouch, and give it to Ghalea, and she will 
        give you the ‘Soil of <br>

        <br>
        *Please make note that i strongly advise not killing the faeries, for

        These are the SGs you have seen your entire EQ life, stomping around the 
        deserts or <br>
        Ro. They do not drop the sand every time, but it is not rare as far as 
        I know. They are very <br>
        resistant to fire spells, and if you can kill a HG with a group, you should 
        be able to take a SG <br>
        with the same group. Not a lot I can tell you about these guys. If your 
        a ranger, I recommend a <br>
        partner, either melee class, or a healer and you can take them down if 
        you are around the <br>
        correct level, or root/dot kite them if you are solo. <br>

        The melatite is not always dropped off the gnomes, but it is not extremely 
        rare. If you <br>
        check the vender that sells the tink bags, you can sometimes find some 
        that has been sold to <br>
        him. The higher the letters, the better chance of it dropping the melatite. 
        Also, Gabbie that drops <br>
        a nice cloak and the EXG model that drops a nice +wis shield are in the 
        same area. I suggest <br>
        buying the melatite, for killing the gnomes will make you ‘kos’ in Ak’anon. 
        (Fighting in SolB will <br>
        raise faction with most of the dropped ones.) From what I can tell, the 
        robots do not aggro if <br>
        you are not ‘kos’ even if you are fighting one. The only way they aggro 
        is attacking one directly <br>
        or being ‘kos’. As you enter the gnome area in SolA, you will see a spawn 
        right next to a <br>
        bridge. It is one of the mid level ones, and has a chance of dropping 
        the melatite, without many <br>
        problems. The highest models have a knock back spell, so make sure not 
        to put your back to <br>
        any lava. I did this solo at low 40s. <br>

        The MM granite is needed twice in this quest, but it is *Lore. So I suggest 
        getting it last. <br>
        It drops off any of the higher garg’s in MM, and when you get one, put 
        it in your container and <br>
        now that it is full, hit combine, then get another piece of MM granite, 
        and you are done. I got <br>
        mine from the room just to the right of room #14 on the EqAtlas map. I 
        took a few friends and <br>
        grabbed this as we were heading to a camp deep in MM. (Maid for the NS 
        wreath for Rat.) <br>
        We were all 42-49 (me and three druids(Thanks again Rat, Rv, and Cel.)).

        This guy is on a spawn table with the Jboots gnome, the high level monk, 
        and ‘a drake’. <br>
        If any of them is up, he won’t be. They all despawn after enough time, 
        but waiting can take up <br>
        to 80 RL hours. If the Jboots gnome is up, and you can kill him, do so. 
        You lose no faction, and <br>
        have a chance of spawning him. He tends to roam in the HG area, and the 
        HGs don’t like him <br>
        much. If a HG see him before you do, he will be killed, you won’t have 
        any chance of getting <br>
        him till next go around. Rat and I went to the area and a shout was giving 
        that he was up just as <br>
        we were about to give. We hurried over and Rat and I killed it while a 
        few people in the area <br>
        gave a few nukes and swings to help out. Rat and I did this in the level 
        40 area. <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        I saw Slaythe for the first and only time yesterday. I at level 45, still 
        with my friend Rat. <br>
        We went in on the only zone into the live side, and started down the hallway. 
        Using Rat’s <br>
        sup-camo we had very little trouble getting down there. Turns out that 
        the rare spawn mino was <br>
        up, and can see though camo. While Rat tried to evac us, about 5-6 spawns 
        beat us and killed <br>
        us both. We went back and as we were heading around the paths, camo started 
        to drop and <br>
        instead of getting aggro’d there and risk the chance of getting Rat and 
        I killed again, I ran though <br>
        Live side aggro’ing about all of it and making it to Upper Guk *grins*. 
        When we went back <br>
        again, I tried to scout for the mino and he got the jump on me. I ran 
        back to the zoneline and <br>
        turned around and with the help of Rat, we killed him and got the azure 
        sleeves off him. After <br>
        that, re camo’ing we walked strait to the room, no problem. Slaythe is 
        a low level frog. He is <br>
        higher then 13 as it says on Illia’s Bestiary because it took me about 
        20 seconds of slashing <br>
        away before he fell. Also, on EqAtlas, it seems a little confusing about 
        where he is on the map. <br>
        He is in the hallway NORTH (as in up) from the number 7 on the map. The 
        twisty hallway <br>
        above the number 7 is the one you want. One of the mino’s saw though invis, 
        the other did not. <br>
        I pulled one, and the other stayed. Not sure why, but didn’t question 
        it to long. After killing the <br>
        other, we killed the frog, got what we needed, and left. <br>
