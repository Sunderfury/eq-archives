              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"><b>The 
                Boy Scout or Girl Guide Handbook (aka newbie ranger guide) for 
                the Half-Elves</b> </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">So 
                you want to be a ranger. Not a druid, druids don't get to use 
                bladed weapons. They may get all the cool spells and power magic 
                first, but -you- are special. You've got that x-factor called 
                Tracking. This is surefall Glade, your home away from home. You'll 
                want to learn Sense Direction, Tracking, One Handed Slash, and 
                Taunt first. Keep that extra point for later use... </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">So 
                you start out with your homemade short sword. Sure, that'll last, 
                at least until you cut down a decaying skeleton and retrieve something 
                better, say a rusty longsword. A note? Go find Hager Sureshot. 
                If you can't find him maybe you're not cut out to be a ranger. 
                Hint: Use tracking. You'll get a nice piece of armor which should 
                last you a few levels. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Go 
                outside, to Qeynos Hills, and you can track down rats and snakes 
                and bats. NO. That's boring. Use your skills to find decaying 
                skeletons and gnoll pups, when they are cut down by your awesome 
                sharp piece of metal, the rangers like you better. Plus sometimes 
                they have weapons, armor, or *bags* on them. And more loot than 
                say, a rat's tooth. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Warning: 
                I know you kids like to track down lots of skeletons but don't 
                go overboard and go too near the ruins. You'll never know when 
                suddenly your fighting -one- decaying skeleton and his buddy Dread 
                Corpse taps on your shoulder and before you know it, you wake 
                up naked next to the campfire outside Surefall Glade. You don't 
                want to experience that until you've had a few drinks. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Which 
                brings us to Qeynos. Say you don't like the competition near Surefall 
                Glade. Just run (I mean run) down the road to Qeynos dont stop 
                unless you want Gnasher to disembowel you and wipe your ranger 
                tunic on his arse. Quickly run down and zone out, and you are 
                in the Qeynos area. It's very crowded I know, but at least there 
                are more creatures about faster. And your tracking skill should 
                let you keep the prime cut of the skeletons there. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Bone 
                chips are best not sold to shadowknights. Those kids are sick 
                psychopaths who'd harm touch your spleen out if you weren't protected 
                by the Divine Magic. Sell them to the vendors instead. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Fishing: 
                When you have some coin, say 3 gold pieces, go back to our Surefall 
                Glade and buy a rod and bait, and ask your guildmaster for a few 
                pointers first, then go to the lake at Qeynos Hills and fish. 
                Alternately you could fish in the surefall glade pond, but you 
                might fall in and piranhas might rip your flesh off in seconds. 
                Fishing in Qeynos Hills requires you to keep an eye out for enemies 
                who would creep up on you and cackle loudly as they frighten the 
                fish off. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Quests: 
                I think in the Surefall Inn there's someone who needs a young 
                scout to collect a gift from South Qeynos. Hey, it's a chance 
                to go sightseeing. </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Well 
                that's all for now kids and remember don't touch the mangy rat 
                you don't know where its been. </font></p>
