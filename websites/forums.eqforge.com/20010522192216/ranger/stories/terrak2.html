                <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                  stones were thrown down by the ancient dwarf, as tears of blood 
                  streaked down his face. The pain swelled up in his head with 
                  a heat as intense as any forge fire in Kaladim. With eyelids 
                  sewn shut, this mysterious figure could see images that no other 
                  Cleric of Brell could possibly see. He lowers his head and moves 
                  his fingers over the stones, shaking hands grasping at images 
                  seen only in his mind. Suddenly, he throws up his head and outstretches 
                  his arms to the heavens and screams aloud, "Why Great Brell! 
                  Fer all of Kaladim, why?" </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                  came on a Dark Night and foretold a grim prophecy..one that 
                  King Kazon Stormhammer would not listen to, one that would foretell 
                  his own demise by an assassin's blade. The King, in a false 
                  belief of security behind Kaladim's stone walls, was too ignorant 
                  to listen. Now upon a funeral pyre he lays, cries of sorrow 
                  echoing throughout Kaladim's halls. The joy and wonder of Kaladim 
                  now lost, all because Kazon would not listen. Aazimar Coldstone, 
                  King of Clan Battlehammer, would listen.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> 
                  The Old Paladin leaned forward and grabbed the blind seer, catching 
                  him before he falls. "What do ye see old one? What makes yur 
                  blood run cold?" The shaking seer pulls Aazimar forward and 
                  grabs his face. The Old Paladin begins to shake convulsively, 
                  as the seer whispers one word. "Learn..." </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Upon 
                  a battlefield Aazimar stands, with sword drawn dripping in blood. 
                  Thousands of bodies are strewn about, some dead while others 
                  shake as death grips hold of them. The sounds of Battle can 
                  be heard all around, as Dark Warriors drive through Kaladim's 
                  forces. Waves of these creatures charge towards the dwarven 
                  defenders, in a battle frenzy that looks almost animalistic. 
                  All around him, his comrades of many years fall to the onslaught 
                  rushing upon Kaladim. A figure in Dark Platemail hurls himself 
                  at Aazimar, screaming in raspy tones, "For Innoruuk!" Blades 
                  meet and the years of training holds true for Aazimar as a counter 
                  thrust drives his sword deep within the creature's chest. A 
                  bright light bursts from Aazimar's weapon as the creature hisses 
                  and explodes. "In Brell's Name, dey are Undead!" </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">What 
                  seems to be hours Aazimar fights; for Home, for Family and for 
                  his God. Although the battle has been long, still wave after 
                  wave of undead creatures flow across the Butcherblock country 
                  side. The Dwarves fight Valiantly but soon they stand at the 
                  Gates of Kaladim itself. "Der is no end to dese Creatures!" 
                  Aazimar shouts, "Seal da Gates of Kaladim!" </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Above 
                  the sound of Battle a giant mechanism can be heard. Gears grinding 
                  and giant stones moving from the places set many years ago. 
                  Kaladim's Last defense; a hundred tons of solid stone that when 
                  sealed cannot be opened. The "Gate" as it is known, is the Dwarven 
                  City's last defense, to be closed when all else fails and up 
                  until this point has never been used. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Slowly 
                  the mountain itself slides to keep out the onslaught. "Argh!" 
                  the old paladin screams, as an arrow shaft can be seen sticking 
                  out of his Chestplate. Aazimar reaches down and tries to pull 
                  it out, but his strength is lost. Darkness begins to overcome 
                  him as he feels himself falling. His last sight, the last thing 
                  he sees before he finally falls, is his assailant. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Upon 
                  a Black Horse a Creature rides, noticeably above the throngs 
                  of fowl creatures. In his hands he carries a dark bow that glows 
                  with an evil green light. This figure is covered from head to 
                  toe in black, but his face can be seen beneath his cowl. Upon 
                  the figure's lips, Aazimar sees him utter two words..."For Innoruuk." 
                  The old seer's face comes into view, as Aazimar whipes a cold 
                  sweat from his brow. He is shaken by this image...an Image of 
                  what may be or an Image of what WILL come. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Only 
                  Brell knows for sure. </font></p>
                <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Aazimar 
                  does know one thing as he begins to gather his thoughts. The 
                  face of the Dark Figure on horseback, the one that cut his life 
                  from him in battle. Aazimar met this person not too long ago 
                  and remembers his name...</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">"Terrak".
