                for Rangers in the Kelethin region</b></font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I've 
                made a system where I can level characters to level nine in roughly 
                16-20 hrs of playing. This system I did until level nine with 
                a Wood Elf Druid, but which I created with my Wood Elf Ranger 
                & High Elf Wizard. And yes, to head off the question, this is 
                considered powergaming for greatest exp/cash for your time spent. 
                This guide is good for any class/race that can be created on Faydwer. 
                I'll do it level by level for simplicity. This is meant for the 
                character who wants to solo the game. Numerous combinations can 
                be made from grouping. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 
                1-3: Bats, giant wasps, decaying skeletons, black wolves if you 
                would like. Occasional orc pawns, and widow hatchlings may be 
                thrown in level 2 & 3. Bats, wasps, etc. will continue to give 
                exp. upwards to level 5 and level 6 if wanted, but it will become 
                tediously slow. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 
                4-7: Move into Butcherblock Mountains (Head SW from the Priest 
                of Discord lift). Don't worry about a bind, it's a short walk 
                (5 mins or so). Once there, follow the path towards the two houses 
                that will appear before you. This is one of the areas that you 
                will want to hunt at. You're looking for giant skunks at level 
                4, and the occasional large snake. This hunting area can be extending 
                along the path until you hit the crossroads with the guard post 
                farther down. At level 5-7 giant snakes and giant spiders should 
                be killed as well, giant skunks give out at level 6. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 
                7-10: Dwarf skeletons found in Butcherblock Mountains. This can 
                be started at level 6, but one must be careful. Dwarf skeletons 
                may be found at the Golden Tower, and the Dwarven Graveyard (Druid 
                Ruins). The Golden Tower may be found by following the path that 
                reached the crossroads, do not turn, as that path will take you 
                to Kaladim. Continue along the path until the end of the first 
                turn there (right before the second), and look right. You should 
                be able to see a canyon in the mountain landscape, run into it. 
                Within 10 seconds one should find themselves in front of the Golden 
                Tower. There are three dwarf skeleton spawns here; one close to 
                the opening where you came in, one inside the tower, and one on 
                the left side of the tower from the entrance. The Dwarven Graveyard 
                (Druid Ruins) may be found by continuing from the Golden Tower 
                into the canyon. You will find a fork not far from the tower, 
                you want to go left. You will again find a fork not far into this. 
                Go right here. Follow ahead, and you should find a glowing ruins 
                area. There is a druid here that you may sell to for decent prices, 
                not so good as the guild, but better than the Wood Elf NPC merchants. 
                There are five dwarf skeleton spawn sites here; behind the ruins, 
                towards the left and right of the ruins, in front of the ruins, 
                and over a hill behind another shrine.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 
                10: Goblin warriors in Butcherblock and/or orc centurions in Crushbone. 
                The Goblin Warriors may be found by taking the path to Kaladim 
                from the crossroads. Down the path you'll find another guard post. 
                Turn left there and you should be able to see a goblin camp. This 
                is where (and only where) the goblin warriors will spawn. Three 
                goblin warriors spawn here; one in each of the tents, and one 
                at the campfire. Some will appear green, but a majority will be 
                blue. Lowland basilisks and giant scarabs are also available for 
                exp. Giant scarabs do not spawn in any specific point, and the 
                stun from a lowland basilisk can be devastating. The orc centurions 
                in Crushbone spawn nearly everywhere. Stay out of the castle, 
                and beware of trains. Most everything that isn't a centurion will 
                drop you like a rock from 20,000ft up in there. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 
                11-14: Skeletons in Steamfont. One must journey to Lesser Faydark 
                and then to steamfont to reach it from Greater Faydark. The Lesser 
                Faydark entrance is the first entrance you find going left from 
                the fork out of Felwithe. In Lesser Faydark, follow the left wall, 
                along the corner of the zone, and the first entrance you see will 
                be Steamfont. Walk should not take more than 5 mins in Lesser 
                Fay. In Steamfont, follow the path before you until you reach 
                the crossroads with a watchman at it (Watchman Hal I believe). 
                Take a left here. Follow the path until you begin to see the windmills. 
                Go off the path in the straight line onto one of the rocky outcrops 
                of the Steamfont Mountains. You should be able to see a large 
                skeleton, commonly called the Dragon's Skeleton. There are four 
                spawn sites here; one at the mouth, and three along the rear. 
                Skeletons are not the only things to spawn here. Minotaur Slavers 
                and Gnome Skeletons will occasionally spawn here. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 
                15-16: Back to Butcherblock to go to the Orc Shrine. The orc shrine 
                may be found by making a right turn approximately halfway between 
                the Two Houses and the Crossroads in Butcherblock, and keeping 
                right. This spot may be attempted as early as level 13 or 14 if 
                one is careful. Orcs spawn around the obelisk in a triangle; two 
                up front, and one in the back. Centurions and Oracles spawn here, 
                with the oracles being the harder of the two. Do NOT underestimate 
                these orcs, they are the much larger brethren of the fellows at 
                the orc camps. A centurion here can easily rival an orc legionnaire 
                in Crushbone. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Level 
                17-18 will be added at a later date as the only subjects I've 
                found to kill solo for good exp are death beatles, tormented dead, 
                and the other yard trash in Unrest. This guide is not to say that 
                other places are devoid and inferior for advancement and money. 
                There are orc camps in Lesser Faydark, as well as a Skeleton/Mummy 
                area as well. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">For 
                armor, Patchwork armor is something I highly recommend. Leather 
                armor costs a few pp for each piece, and patchwork is only a few 
                ac points less and costs a mere 6 silver if you train in tailoring 
                and hunt wolves (another thing I recommend, and I'll justify it 
                to anyone).</font></p>
