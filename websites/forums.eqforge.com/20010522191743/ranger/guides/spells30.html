                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>First 
                  rank of spells, obtainable at level nine:</b> </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Endure 
                  Fire: Not the first spell I would pick up at this level if you 
                  are short on funds. Resists are nice, but hardly necessary at 
                  your level. Perhaps with this up you might fend off one or two 
                  more fire-based spells than you would have. At higher levels 
                  when you have already higher resists due to equipment this added 
                  bonus can be the deciding factor whether or not your skin ignites. 
                  I only have this up when I know I will be the target of fire 
                  based spells. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Flame 
                  Lick: The fourth spell I would by at this level, it reduces 
                  your targets ac and does slow damage to them over the course 
                  of the spell. When you first get it, it makes an excellent alternative 
                  to pulling with your bow and with the added bonus of increasing 
                  your chances to hit them due to their lower ac. At higher levels 
                  it makes an effective taunt (there are reasons why you want 
                  mobs to hit you) and since it uses very little mana it is still 
                  a good pulling tool. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Glimpse: 
                  One can definitely hold off a while before getting this spell. 
                  It pretty much acts as if your character has binoculars on. 
                  Yeah, that's it. While its useful in some cases, its not a spell 
                  I would have taking up a spell slot. (It might not be a problem 
                  now, but once you have a vast array of spells to choose form, 
                  you will have to pick the ones you want very carefully based 
                  on many factors.) The best use I can think is to get your divination 
                  up so that when you get camouflage you actually have a chance 
                  to cast it. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Lull 
                  Animal: This spell decreases the aggro radius of animals. This 
                  spell is one I never bothered to get and I would recommend you 
                  do the same. Since most animal types are roaming mobs this spell 
                  is very limited in its usefulness. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Minor 
                  Healing: Get this spell. I assume you've been tired enough of 
                  sitting down waiting to heal up so you can kill the next thing. 
                  With this spell you can heal 10 hit points at a time to anyone, 
                  reducing your and your group's downtime, making you more effective.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"> 
                  GET THIS SPELL. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Skin 
                  Like Wood: This is the second spell to get, aside from the comical 
                  aspect of buffing someone and informing them that "You now have 
                  wood." It's a very useful spell adding a bit to both armor and 
                  hit points, this spell will increase your survivability. Don't 
                  forget however that you can cast it on others in your party 
                  increasing everyone's toughness. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Snare: 
                  The third spell I would recommend you get at this level, but 
                  one you should get soon. Unlike all the other spells you receive 
                  this level, this spell will most likely be with you through 
                  your entire journey to 60. It has the effect of slowing a mob's 
                  movement speed, allowing you not only to get away from it if 
                  you need to run, but also to almost always stay out of melee 
                  range. This tactic of attacking a mob following you is called 
                  kiting and usually done by spell caster classes, we can do it 
                  as well. An added benefit is that when a mob is almost dead 
                  it will try to run away from you. A snared mob however will 
                  stop in its tracks when it tries to run. This may seem a small 
                  benefit now, but later in life it means the difference of killing 
                  a mob, and having it run off and bring 20 of its friends to 
                  kill your group off. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>Second 
                  rank of spells, obtainable at level fifteen: </b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Burst 
                  of Fire: While a 15 point direct damage spell is nice, I don't 
                  really consider it all that valuable at this level. If you want 
                  to root and soften up a mob with it or snare kite one a bit 
                  with this spell, you'll have the option. But with a good bow 
                  and arrows you should be able to deal more damage out than with 
                  this spell, and still have mana for healing up in the downtime. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Camouflage: 
                  Get this spell. Invisibility is priceless in a lot of instances. 
                  Sneaking past aggro mobs to join a group or get your corpse, 
                  or invising the entire party to get further into a zone. Hopefully 
                  you have practiced your divination up to a good level by using 
                  glimpse at lower levels. Warning though this spell gives a very 
                  short warning when it is about to drop and the duration fluctuates 
                  wildly at lower levels. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Cure 
                  Poison: In my honest opinion this spell is not worth much. It 
                  can cure a weak poison easily but by the time you get this spell, 
                  it will not really be worth stopping combat to cure the poison. 
                  Even near death it would be better to step back and cast a few 
                  healing spells yourself. Against any poison stronger than weak 
                  the multiple times of casting it will use more mana than healing 
                  yourself through the duration. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Feet 
                  Like Cat: A very good spell, one I always have up myself. There 
                  are many benefits from this spell aside from the obvious increase 
                  in ac it will give you. Agility also affects how often your 
                  defensive skills will activate. Right now you only have dodge, 
                  but soon you will get parry and eventually riposte. A higher 
                  agility will mean these go off more often and you will end up 
                  taking less damage. Another great thing about this is that druids 
                  do not get it, this is a shaman spell. This makes us still able 
                  to cast this on party members even when a druid of equal level 
                  is present. Other "tanks" are always glad when you increase 
                  their ac with this spell. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Grasping 
                  Roots: A great spell and I highly recommend that you purchase 
                  this one as son as you can. This spell allows you to totally 
                  immobilize a target and do some damage as well. Root a mob, 
                  back up and fill it full of arrows or dump some burn onto it 
                  with spells. It is also useful for "root pulling" and "root 
                  parking" which is a technique used to pull excess mobs of your 
                  group, root them farther away, and return to your group so that 
                  you face less mobs at once. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Invoke 
                  Lightning: A 25 point AoE spell. A very useful for crowded situations 
                  like orcs in HighHold. Fifty or seventy-five damage in the time 
                  it casts is great damage, just watch how many mobs you aggro 
                  onto yourself at once. Warning you can harm yourself with this 
                  spell so be careful. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Thistle 
                  Coat: A good spell at this level giving you increased and damaging 
                  the enemy each time they hit you. One point may not seem like 
                  much but by the end of the battle it usually adds up to two 
                  or three free swings of equivalent damage. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Dance 
                  of Fireflies: You will need to get this spell eventually. Since 
                  two-thirds of rangers already have infravision and the others 
                  most likely have a GLS or equivalent by now, most rangers would 
                  most likely not pick this up. Don't make this mistake, this 
                  is your ONLY way to practice conjuration before you get the 
                  30th level spell of Stinging Swarm. If you haven't practiced 
                  Conjuration up at least to the 100 mark, you will fizzle a great 
                  deal and waste large amounts of mana and time trying to get 
                  Stinging Swarm to work. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff"><b>Third 
                  rank of spells, obtainable at level twenty-two: </b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Bind 
                  Sight: Useful for watching a puller get mobs and to see where 
                  they go so you can learn a zone. Also a great tool for harmony 
                  pulling around corners. Play with it, if you get good, you will 
                  love this spell. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Enduring 
                  Breath: Most useful when you know you will be swimming a lot, 
                  and a life saver if you go ld. Once you get to mid thirties 
                  you might try hunting in Kedge Keep where you will need this 
                  spell and a healthy level in swimming. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Harmony: 
                  Another spell that will be making appearances in your spell 
                  slots for the rest of your rangerly life. It reduces a mobs 
                  aggro radius, but it's an aoe, so it reduces the aggro radius 
                  of mobs near your target as well. Harmony a mob standing next 
                  to 4 others, flame lick it and he runs right at you, leaving 
                  his friends just standing on you. You will love this spell, 
                  your groups will love this spell. Ignite: Not a bad spell, a 
                  few extra blasts of 37 before a mob reaches you is helpful. 
                  That's about all I am going to say about it. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Light 
                  Healing: I assume by now there is no real point in telling you 
                  to get this spell, unless you like healing yourself ten times 
                  for a bar of health. In case I am wrong, GET IT!! </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Skin 
                  Like Rock: Improved Skin Like Wood, get it, keep it up all the 
                  time, buff others with it if possible. Ward Summoned: If you 
                  plan on fighting a lot of summoned creatures get it and replace 
                  ignite with it, if not then don't bother at all with this spell.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Barb 
                  Coat: An upgrade of thistle coat providing more protection and

                  weapons? Pull with a cancel magic. It has limited use, but when 
                  you need it, it is awesome. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Eyes 
                  of the Cat: If you're a human get it for Corpse runs, if not, 
                  save your plat. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Invigor: 
                  Restores lost stamina to your target. Good, especially useful 
                  when you are underwater using a Wurmslayer. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Shield 
                  of Thistles: When combined with Barb Coat it gives you an eight 
                  point damage shield. Pretty potent when you solo and this also 
                  allows you to damage shield group-mates before a big fight. 
                  Definitely a keeper. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Stinging 
                  Swarm: About 120 points of damage over time. This is great for 
                  opening a fight or for rooting a mob while hitting it with this 
                  and peppering it with arrows. Just watch you don't put it on 
                  a mob that the chanter wants to mez. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="ffffff">Strength 
                  of Earth: If at this point you don't want an extra 15 strength 
                  with you all the time, quit playing a melee. You will also be 
                  the love of the group once you can hand a warrior 15 agi 15 
                  str and a damage shield. </font> </p>
