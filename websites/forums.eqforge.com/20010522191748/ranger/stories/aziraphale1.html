                from Norrath</font></b>
              </center>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
                The lone figure walked through the dense mass of trees, humming 
                quietly to himself a tune from his childhood. His feet made little 
                sound on the soft earth beneath and the heat of the day caused 
                a light sweat to break out along his brow. A rivulet of his body’s 
                moisture ran down the centre of his back - he wished it would 
                soon rain and break this terrible warmth. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Almost 
                as if Tunare had read his thoughts (and he believed in all sincerity 
                that she could easily do so), a drop from the heavens found it’s 
                way through the canopy above and landed on his left cheek. Many 
                more soon followed and Aziraphale found a large oak under which 
                to sit for a spell. The huge branches tried their best to keep 
                him dry but the rain found it’s way through in sufficient quantity 
                to keep him well refreshed. He leaned back against the mighty 
                hardwood and listened to the lulling sound of the water falling 
                all around him. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                stared intently at a drop of rain slowly running down the length 
                of his arm. It followed a convoluted path, zigzagging back and 
                forth through the wrinkles in his leather tunic, and it brought 
                an analogy to him regarding his own life. After years of travelling 
                the globe, he had happened upon the lands of Norrath; finally 
                settling here for good. Had he a birds-eye-view of his life as 
                the God’s did, he was sure his meandering would have appeared 
                much like that of the raindrop. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Aziraphale 
                leaned his head back and closed his eyes for a moment. The smell 
                of pines wafted through the air and the sharp odour tore through 
                his memory like a knife. Suddenly his mind’s eye was back at his 
                birthplace, on the Isle of Barra. He could see his mother’s beautiful 
                Elven face, bringing him his supper as he sat by the end of the 
                path to their house. He would wait there most days for his father 
                to return from the mines, and on those occasions when he ran late, 
                she allowed Aziraphale to eat outside. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">He 
                thought back to his father lying in bed, dying from the horrible 
                black dust that was decaying his lungs. He remembered the news 
                of his mother’s slaughter at the hands of a band of Ogres shortly 
                after Aziraphale left home; recalled the teachings he’d received 
                from them both on tolerance and fairness. He’d done, he thought, 
                his best to do them proud and hoped that Tunare would keep them 
                safe and warm for all eternity. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                loud snap of a twig jarred him from his daydreams and in one swift 
                motion Aziraphale was up on his feet, his large sword clutched 
                lightly in his right hand. The rain had dulled the sounds in the 
                woods and his normally acute hearing had allowed something to 
                get quite close without his noticing. He scanned the forest with 
                his sharp eyes and spotted a dark shape passing between two trees 
                perhaps fifty yards in front of him. He quietly closed the distance 
                to get a better look. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
                he approached, the dark shape began to take clearer form and the 
                ranger quickly recognized it as that of a large dog-like beast. 
                It walked on two legs, slightly crouched, and was sniffing the 
                air as it went. Aziraphale knew it was a Gnoll, but he’d not seen 
                one quite this large before. His heart raced a bit faster and 
                he quickened his pace. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Whether 
                it caught his scent or it’s hearing was that much better than 
                Aziraphale had thought, the beast suddenly turned and looked right 
                at him. They were now merely twenty yards apart and the Half-elf 
                could clearly make out the markings on the tunic worn by the dark 
                creature - identifying it as one of the Sabretooths from Blackburrow. 
                But that den was several miles from here and to see a fully matured 
                Gnoll out this far was a rarity indeed. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">With 
                a loud howl the brute ran towards Aziraphale, waving its arms 
                in the air and baring its sharp teeth. The ranger finally noticed 
                the long sword the beast carried and brought his own two-handed 
                version up to the ready. Setting his feet apart to steady himself, 
                he awaited the imminent collision. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Gnoll brought its weapon down hard and Aziraphale quickly sidestepped 
                to avoid it, bringing his own up in a high arc and catching the 
                gruff creature across the ribcage. The blade sliced cleanly and 
                he was rewarded with a satisfying grunt of pain from the Gnoll. 
                He followed with a firm kick and connected well with the Gnoll’s 
                left knee, but it was like kicking a tree and did little to harm 
                the creature. Spinning around to face it, Aziraphale brought his 
                sword up high once again…or tried to. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Still 
                somewhat new to the large weapon, he forgot how heavy and slow 
                it was. Intending to get a quick attack on the beast’s backside, 
                he instead found himself well open to the return blow. The Gnoll’s 
                sword cut deeply into Aziraphale’s chest, and he could clearly 
                see his own blood flinging off as the steel passed by his face 
                on the continuing arc. He reeled back and brought the mighty two-handed 
                blade down again, catching the Gnoll well on the left shoulder, 
                burying the sharp steel easily down to the large blades of bone 
                in the hulking dog’s back. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Although 
                the Gnoll’s long sword was rusted and in poor condition, it was 
                still quite lethal and continued to cut through Aziraphale’s leather 
                armour again and again. Worse, the mangy dog had teeth and claws, 
                and they were adding quickly to the wounds the young ranger was 
                suffering. Blood flowed freely from both adversaries, staining 
                the undergrowth beneath their feet. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                battle continued back and forth in this manner for what seemed 
                like an eternity. Damage to both parties was heavy and anyone 
                witnessing it would have been hard pressed to choose who was landing 
                the most hits. While the Gnoll had sharp claws and a fast sword, 
                Aziraphale had the huge blade of his two-handed weapon, and his 
                kicks were starting to take their toll. Exhaustion was closing 
                in on them, along with the dark of night. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                Gnoll took a hard swing and Aziraphale quickly ducked. His reactions 
                were slowing as the battle wore on and the blade barely passed 
                over his head. The beast had lost the use of its left arm, and 
                with that last pass of its sword, had left itself open. The Half-elf 
                quickly seized the opportunity and brought his own sword to bear 
                as hard as he could. The long blade arced swiftly across the Gnoll’s 
                midriff, and kept swinging so effortlessly Aziraphale was sure 
                he had missed! He could almost feel the strike he knew would come 
                next, and said a silent prayer to Tunare for forgiveness of his 
                failure. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">But 
                the creature howled louder than ever; a painful sharp sound that 
                he’d not heard before. It was then that he saw the gash he’d opened 
                up with that last swing. The Gnoll dropped its sword and looked 
                down at itself, desperately trying to push back with its one good 
                hand the intestines that were now spilling out of the large rent. 
                Weariness swarmed Aziraphale and he dropped to his knees, letting 
                his sword fall to the ground. As if in a mirror the Gnoll also 
                dropped to its knees, and for a moment they stayed that way, appearing 
                in mutual prayer. Then the dark beast fell over on its side and 
                lay still, its tongue hanging limply out of its mouth. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Aziraphale 
                gulped down air as quickly as he could, answering his lungs begging 
                calls for oxygen. Sounds from the woods started to come back to 
                him as the ringing in his ears from the din of battle subsided, 
                and he noticed for the first time that it had stopped raining. 
                He sat down to recover himself and watched a lone drop of blood 
                wend its way down the arm of his tunic. Whose blood, he did not 
                know. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When 
                he was able to concentrate once more, he began working the limited 
                magic he’d been taught at his guild. Weaving a complex pattern 
                in the air with his hands, he called upon the invisible powers 
                that surrounded everything in Norrath. Some of his wounds closed 
                a bit, and the bleeding diminished enough that he knew he would 
                not die from its loss. Aziraphale said a quick thank you to Tunare 
                for granting him this small power; for while not even close to 
                being in the same class as those who used spells for a living, 
                he was grateful none the less. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Shakily 
                he rose and walked over to the inert form of the Gnoll. He bent 
                down and searched the pockets and pouches, finding only a scrap 
                of paper. Opening the note, he read through it quickly. Then once 
                again to be sure. The implications of the words within came to 
                him right away and at once he knew who this beast was. His mind 
                raced back to the previous week, when he had spoken to Larsk Juton 
                of Surefall Glade. Larsk had told Aziraphale to be on the lookout 
                for a Gnoll by the name of Furgutt, who occasionally roamed the 
                region of Qeynos Hills. And to bring him proof should he ever 
                encounter and slay the beast. </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                weary ranger bent over, picked up the large two-handed sword from 
                where he had dropped it, and held it across his shoulder with 
                his right hand. He then stooped over the Gnoll and, with his other 
                hand, grasped a handful of thick fur on the beast’s head and began 
                to drag the body. A few yards away lay a fallen tree and Aziraphale 
                laid the creature’s limp head over the trunk. With no small effort, 
                he raised his mighty sword high above his head and brought it 
                down in one swift stroke upon the neck of the slain Gnoll. The 
                head severed cleanly, rolled off the trunk and bounced to a stop 
                on the ground. Aziraphale bent and tore the mangled jersey off 
                the remains of the Gnoll and wrapped the head carefully, so as 
                not to ruin his other goods. He then stored the package neatly 
                in his backpack, along with the rusty long sword, and headed back 
                in the direction of the Glade…humming a song to himself from his 
                childhood.</font></p>
