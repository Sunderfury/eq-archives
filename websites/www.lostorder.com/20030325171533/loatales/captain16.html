<p align=left><b>Captain's Log: Leafdawning 15, 11 P.Y.</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I woke up on the mornin’ of the 11th after a few days spent at the bottom of a barrel of ale, and figured it was time fer me to move on from Cragstone. Well I dragged me sorry carcass out of the Thorsten’s Rest and tried to shield me achin’ eyes and throbbin’ head from the sun. Go figure one of the few sunny days I’ve seen since coming to Dereth and it’s a day when I’ve got a real banger of a headache.</p>

<p align=left>Still I wanted to make the most of the day and all its potential, and perhaps find the pyreal to buy me way out of this hangover. I headed over to Scildith’s Bow’s and picked up a quiver of his finest arrows. Today I figured I’d head for Rithwic, since the road east and south out of Cragstone is a little less treacherous that the road north and west.</p>

<p align=left>Well perhaps this wasn’t such a good day fer traveling. I was just out of sight of Cragstone when I came upon a group of young banderlings raiding one of the farms just south east of town. Well I notched an arrow in my trusty oak yumi and took aim at the lead banderling. I let my shaft fly, and true to its mark I struck the banderling square in the chest. Well if there was anything that could grab a banderlings attention faster than a pile of pyreals its an arrow in the gizzard. He started howling and screaming at the top of his lung and he and his mates started after me. Thanks to the speed of me bow, and my returning skills I managed to drop the lead banderling after he took only 10 paces. I hoped this would discourage his mates from picking me apart.</p>

<p align=left>I was wrong.</p>

<p align=left>Well I’m sure you can guess what happened next. I started running. Still in my hung over state, and with as enraged as the banderlings were, I found that I was having trouble staying in front of them. Now we must have run around that farmhouse five times before I managed to run into someone other than a banderling. Seems my friend Rice Cake was out fer a leisurely walk on the road from Rithwic (as if such a walk can be leisurely). Well I ran into him, the banderlings ran into me, and Rice Cake ran through the new lead banderling.</p>

<p align=left>After this chance meeting, the last banderling lost his resolve and ran fer his life. I was too busy making sure I was still in one piece to bother picking him off with my bow. I’m starting to think that was a mistake.</p>

<p align=left>Rice Cake and I chatted for a little bit while I rested from my race around the farmhouse. I was still trying to catch me breath when the owner of the house came out to thank us fer helping save him from. The farmer came out and said “Thank ye so… why you dirty scoundrel!” It was at this point I remember just what farm this was, and on what terms I had last left here. Without further deliberation, I took off running again. I might not have been able to outrun a group of banderlings today, but I managed to outrun one angry farmer.</p>

<p align=left>A short while later Rice Cake caught up with me. We decided to travel together back to Rithwic since the roads are always safer in a group, and we fight fairly well together. This proved to be a very good idea since along the way we found a large number of banderlings hunting along the road. No doubt the one we let live at the farmhouse decided to rouse his bigger brothers. </p>

<p align=left>About three quarters of the way to Rithwic we came upon a group of banderling guards and scouts. One undersized runt of a banderling pointed his finger in our direction and let out a howl. Now I don’t know much banderling speak, but I could figure out what the whelp was sayin’. In common it sounds something like “There they are! Get ‘em!” Well bein’ in no condition to fight a group of banderlings that large I opted to run, but not before I plunked an arrow in that arrogant whelp’s hide.</p>

<p align=left>Well I ran, and Rice Cake ran, but I didn’t run fast enough. One of the banderling guards managed to catch up to me, and when he did he took that club of his and blasted me…</p>

<p align=left>…back to the Cragstone life stone. Well once I got me bearings, I set of running, hoping to catch up with Rice Cake before he too was overrun. I ran back to the site of my untimely demise (giving the farmhouse wide berth this time). When I got there I found Rice Cake standing in the middle of a pile of banderling corpses. I must make a note never to piss him off, since he is obviously an expert with that tachi that he wields.</p>

<p align=left>Reunited we decided to waist no time in getting back to Rithwic for a long rest and a stout ale.</p>
