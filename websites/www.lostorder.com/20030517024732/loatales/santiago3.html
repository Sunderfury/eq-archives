<p align=left><b>The Storm</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Though he would never have admitted it, Santiago was drunk. Not so much that he was in danger of passing out, but more than enough to cloud his wisdom. For wisdom would have warned him that the hour was late, and the abbey doors would soon be closed for the night. Wisdom would have warned him to quit at six bottles of ale instead of plowing on toward a full dozen. But perhaps even wisdom wouldn’t have saved him from Lacey Ebonwind.</p>

<p align=left>It was becoming more and more difficult for him to concentrate upon her words. Instead, he found himself staring at her lips, wondering how they would feel if he kissed her. Even the sound of her voice was intoxicating; it was like listening to a song from a foreign country – he didn’t understand what the words meant, but he could have listened to them all night.</p>

<p align=left>Then she was asking him a question, and he attempted to marshal his enfeebled powers of comprehension.</p>

<p align=left>“Ye know how to use that blade o’ yers?” she was asking.</p>

<p align=left>Santiago blinked. “Thish blade o’ mine?” He hiccuped. “Obvioushly, milady, ye ain’t never seen me in action b’fore. Watch thish.”</p>

<p align=left>He staggered to his feet and, after taking a few moments to keep his balance, he drew his sword. He began swinging it around in what he thought was a dazzling display of dexterity. In actuality, he looked like a hundred-year-old man waving a sword around. At one point, the blade flew out of his hands and nearly impaled one of the tavern patrons. Santiago continued waving his hands through the air; it took him a few minutes to realize that his weapon was missing.</p>

<p align=left>“’Ey!” he cried. “Whar’d me sword go? Ah, thar it is. Thankee, matey.” Santiago paused and gazed blearily around the tavern, looking for Lacey. “Ah! Well, milady? What do ye think? I’ll wager yer impressed, no?”</p>

<p align=left>Lacey managed not to laugh. “Oh, aye,” she said. “I never seen anyone wield a sword like that b’fore.”</p>

<p align=left>“Well no wonder!” he said. “I’m a mashter swordsman, I am!” He hiccuped again.</p>

<p align=left>“A master, eh?” said Lacey, raising one eyebrow. “Well, then, maybe ye could show me a thing or two.” She grabbed his hand and began to lead him toward the door.</p>

<p align=left>“Erm…whar we goin’, milady?” asked Santiago, glancing worriedly over his shoulder at all the booze he had not yet finished. Lacey didn’t answer him, but continued to pull him through the sea of patrons until they stood at the doorway.</p>

<p align=left>“Ye don’t aim to go outside, do ye? It’s rainin’ mice an’ mongbats out thar!”</p>

<p align=left>“Yer not afraid o’ gettin’ a little wet, are ye?”</p>

<p align=left>“Well, no, but…”</p>

<p align=left>“Then come,” she said, whispering in his ear. “I want to see that sword of yers in action.”</p>

<p align=left>If Santiago had been sober, there would have been foghorn alarms going off in his head. As it was, he simply shrugged and followed her outside into the storm.</p>

<p align=left>The skies were as dark as he’d ever seen them, and within seconds the two of them were soaked to the skin. Santiago stumbled through the underbrush, trying to keep up with Lacey.</p>

<p align=left>After a few minutes, she suddenly stopped, placing her hand on his chest. “Here,” she said.</p>

<p align=left>Santiago looked around and frowned in confusion. “What is it, milady? What are we doin’ out here?”</p>

<p align=left>“This,” she said, wrapping her arms around him and pressing her body close to his.</p>

<p align=left>Just then, a bolt of lightning lit up the sky. Santiago suddenly realized what Lacey was up to, as he looked in her clear blue eyes and saw her looking back at him with undisguised hunger. Her hands began to explore his body, and their touch was electrifying. His body began to react to hers; his breathing quickened, and his heart began to pound. As if imbued with a will of their own, his own hands began to slide over her body, wandering to places that usually earned him a slap in the face. She was absolutely intoxicating – her shape, the exotic curves and valleys, a delightful landscape of smooth, wet skin. Another jolt of lightning, as he felt her lips touch his in what became a long, passionate kiss in the rainy darkness. </p>

<p align=left>Santiago’s senses were flooded – with her, with the storm. What was he doing? It was wrong, it was wrong, to be here, doing this. It was Britain all over again, losing his heart in the night to a beautiful stranger. And yet…it would be so easy to give in, to yield to her sweet kisses. Delightful surrender, a night lost in ecstasy. Would it be so very wrong?</p>

<p align=left>“What’s wrong?” she asked, her face still close to his.</p>

<p align=left>“I can’t do this, milady,” he gasped.</p>

<p align=left>“Sure ye can. I’ll show ye how.” She began to kiss him again.</p>

<p align=left>With a struggle that took all of his willpower, he pulled away from her. “No, milady.”</p>

<p align=left>She stood there in the darkness, her eyes suddenly growing dark and angry. “An’ why not?”</p>

<p align=left>His mind swam in murky confusion. “Milady…I…I just can’t,” he said. “I’m…I’m afeared I mought break yer heart some day.”</p>

<p align=left>She scowled bitterly. “What makes ye think I have a heart?” she asked, her voice suddenly cold and icy. “What makes ye think I have a heart to break?”</p>

<p align=left>“I’m sorry, milady,” he said.</p>

<p align=left>“Sorry,” she almost spat the word at him. “I’ll give ye somethin’ to be sorry about!”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago heard the sound of a blade being drawn and suddenly knew that his life might be measured in minutes. He instinctively ducked and rolled as Lacey’s sword sliced into the tree next to him.</p>

<p align=left>“Ye darn bastage!” she screamed. “Hold still! If ye can’t love me like a man, at least fight me like one!”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago didn’t waste his breath replying. No words would have helped; it was a battle he could not win. He had already wounded her, far more than he ever would have wished. The only thing to do now was retreat.</p>

<p align=left>He stumbled blindly through the dark forest, slipping and sliding in the muddy underbrush. His clothes torn, his heart broken, he ran until he could run no more, and then he collapsed against the side of an oak tree. There were no sounds of pursuit; he’d lost her, in more ways than one. Exhausted, he lay there and closed his eyes, allowing the rain to pour over him. He didn’t care if the lightning struck him; he didn’t care if the storm consumed him. He was tired and miserable, and wanted nothing more than to sleep, and forget.</p>
