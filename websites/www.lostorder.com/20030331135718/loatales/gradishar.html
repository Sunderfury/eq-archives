<p align=left><b>Akalabeth According to Gradishar</b><br><i>by Gradishar</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Many ask me what the name "Akalabeth" means. Is Akalabeth a god? A mortal man? An Ideal? It has been debated for many years that Akalabeth was nothing more than the figment of Lord Brimstone's twisted mind. But if you believe such rumors, you would be mistaken, for Akalabeth does exist, and has always existed.</p>

<p align=left>Akalabeth is not a place, is not a person, is not a time. Akalabeth is a symbol of light... is THE symbol of Light for countless races and creatures of the known universe.</p>

<p align=left>Akalabeth is the presence of nobility, kinship, goodness and honor, and all that those things stand for. Akalabeth often takes the shape of the White Lion, the magestic hunter that stalks its prey hidden in the shadows.</p>

<p align=left>Akalabeth is the Shard and Tome, guidance and knowledge, and the journey from this life to the next.</p>

<p align=left>Akalabeth is a state of being, a consciousness, that few ever achieve. It is the trusting of one's brother with your very life, giving of oneself for others, becoming strong through the unity of other like minded and honorable beings.</p>

<p align=left>Friends, Akalabeth is who we are, is what we are and what we stand for. Sing out with pride, you members of the Lost Order of Akalabeth, for the White Lion shall hunt this day and bring glory to us all!</p>
