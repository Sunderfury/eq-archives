<p align=left><b>To My Mistress.....</b><br><i>by unknown</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Oh dear mistress, they are tiring running all over the place but they are amusing little folk. First they went to the wizard’s guild.</p>

<p align=left>When I followed them along, they tried to show off their powers to Naddwin. Those little gnomes ganging up on that little weasel, even a giant rat could have killed that Naddwin * smirks *</p>

<p align=left>These little ‘powerful’ gnomes could not even make it to Rivervale with out an escort from TWO of them big folk. I wish, dear mistess, you had given me the power to cast SoW because I would have loved to see that giant step on each one of them. They did finally make it there.</p>

<p align=left>I thank you dear mistress for providing me the most amusement of the evening. That little gnome dead surrounded by all his family and those big folk tickled my heart.</p>

<p align=left>Your Faithful Servant</p>
