<p align=left><b>Into The Night, Part Six</b><br><i>by Navrip</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>For the first time in several years, flesh surrounded the spirit. It wasn’t familiar flesh, but it was flesh nonetheless. He struggled to remember what to do in this case. Slowly, the eyes cracked open and stared down at the ground below. The arms clumsily braced and pushed upward. He rolled over and sat up in his new body.</p>

<p align=left>“Well,” he croaked out, remembering how to speak. “It’s been a long while since I’ve been in one of these… And it’s a nice, strong one too. That bastard will get his due.”</p>

<p align=left>The body stood up and took a shaky step forward. He stumbled and crashed to the ground. Determined, he stood up again and took another step, this one more stable. He took a few more steps and found that he remembered quickly. He felt the huge battle axe in his hand and looked down at it. “Acceptable,” he muttered.</p>

<p align=left>He walked off in the direction he felt the boy run. The time was growing closer for his mission to be completed.</p>

<p align=left>* * * * *</p>

<p align=left>Metry rushed to Lindsy’s quarters, fearing the worst, hoping for the best. Metry had never heard Agurhar speak in such an icy voice. The northerner was normally full of emotion and warmth, even in his most mundane of statements. But not a few moments ago. No, Agurhar was devoid of all he normally was. Metry could only figure that meant one thing… Agurhar was terrified of something, and that nearly brought Metry to his knees in horror.</p>

<p align=left>Hurtling through the darkness, Metry nearly passed Lindsy’s room. He stopped himself and tried the knob, only to find it locked tight. Between gasps of air, he shouted out to Lindsy. In his fear induced fog, he barely waited for a reply before he allowed paranoia to overcome him. He raised his sword to strike the handle from its foundations when slowly the door opened. Lindsy stood there, clothed in a light gown of silk and lace. Her eyes widened in fright at the sight of Metry, sword poised for a strike, terror etched across his face.</p>

<p align=left>Metry let out a sigh of relief. He dropped his sword and wrapped his arms around his dear, confused priestess. “Oh, thank the heavens you’re here and all right,” Metry breathed.</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy pushed the crazed man away from her gently at first, then forcefully when he wouldn’t budge. “Metry, what in the name of heaven has gotten into you?” she asked quietly. </p>

<p align=left>Metry took this opportunity to gasp in the air his lungs craved after the sprint across the temple. When he had finally recovered, he looked up at Lindsy with fear still smiting his countenance. “I… I don’t know. Agurhar suddenly told me to run. I don’t know why, but the way he said it… Gods, the way he said it was like Death himself had taken his soul.”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy sighed in relief. “Don’t worry,” she said, hoping to reassure him. “Look, here comes Agurhar now.”</p>

<p align=left>Metry turned, and sure enough, the burly warrior was walking through the night. But something wasn’t quite right. His gait was unnatural and forced. He held his axe in the wrong hand, Agurhar was right handed, not left. And he wore an unnerving smile on his face for a man who had just declared death at the door.</p>

<p align=left>“Hello Agurhar,” Lindsy said to him politely, not noticing the abnormalities in a man she barely knew. “Please, tell Metry here that everything is fine.”</p>

<p align=left>“Agurhar? So that’s the name… Well, lass, I’d love to oblige you, but everything isn’t fine,” he replied in a chilly voice. The priests of Paraly could sense a man’s soul by his breath. It was like a finger print, perhaps even finer, for no two were the same and none could be faked or masked. And the faint carriage of air flowing from this man’s throat was vastly different from that which Lindsy had seen a short time ago. But it was familiar…</p>

<p align=left>“Who are you?” Lindsy asked, drawing back from the man. At first, she feared a doppelganger, but the breath of souls had revealed some one she recognized. </p>

<p align=left>A broken grin spread across the face of Agurhar. “Why, lass, while I’m not surprised you don’t recognize me from sight alone, I’m deeply hurt that you can’t tell it’s me. The one who helped saved you so long ago. You never really did say thank you for your deliverance from the lizard men.”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy gasped. “Hogart… But…”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, lass,” Agurhar said, “I’m dead. But that doesn’t mean my soul has dissipated into the ether. Not yet, at least. I’ve still got things to do, people to see, and monsters to destroy.” Lindsy shrunk back from the man that called himself Hogart, the ranger that had rescued her many years ago, when she was just a child, barely aware of her connection with Paraly.</p>

<p align=left>“Begone, foul spirit…” Lindsy whispered, holding up her medallion of faith. Agurhar chuckled, then bowed to Lindsy.</p>

<p align=left>“If begone you desire, begone you shall receive. But I’ll be back when I need to be.” And with that, the body of Agurhar slumped to the ground, unconcious, but alive and well. Metry grabbed him and carried him into Lindsy’s room.</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy sat on the edge of the bed as Metry stared at her. “Who, or what, is Hogart?” he finally asked.</p>

<p align=left>Closing her eyes, Lindsy recalled times bygone. “Hogart… Hogart is some one from my past.” And she reconted her tale.</p>
