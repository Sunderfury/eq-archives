: I agree that some people simply do not understand what the eight virtues are about, 
: but I do not agree that game code could not be made to favour a certain play-style.

: As I tried to say in my post I think a &quot;Virtue reward&quot; would work if it was hard to achive
: and not &quot;worth&quot; anything seen from a powerplayer's perspective.

: But then again I might be wrong.
