<p align=left><b>From Dracherio's Journal</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>My earliest memories of Toxxulia Forest are memories of darkness. I think there can be no darker place in the world. Even during the brightest hours of the daytime, a vapid green fog permeates the forest. Sounds echo eerily through that mist – the eerie cries of kobolds, the clicking and crawling of beetles and spiders. It is a forest full of invisible enemies – and what you cannot see, your imagination paints in vivid, ghastly detail. Imagination is the fuel of terror – it feeds it and nourishes it until sanity itself falters and succumbs to primal, wide-eyed fear.</p>

<p align=left>Fear and I are old enemies. We Erudites learn to conquer fear in Toxxulia – or we fall prey to it. Oh, and don’t believe that just because I study the Dark Arts, that I am immune to fear. I, too, shiver at the thought of what lurks out there, in that impenetrable gloom. I, too, am afraid of death, afraid of coming to a final and eternal end. Perhaps that is why I study death – for with knowledge, our fear of the unknown diminishes. So it is that I spend most of my life in the company of the Undead.</p>

<p align=left>Yes, I summon the dead to do my bidding. From a few pieces of broken bones, I am able to create a tireless servant, unbendingly loyal. Condemn me, if you like, but think upon this. You who read these words, you who have a beating heart, you who breathe and live…one day your heart will not beat, and you will not breathe, and you will live no more. You will fall past the edge of life into that great abyss, and you will finally know the answer that great question, which no one has ever really answered: “Where do we go when we die?” Is it an eternal dream? Is it an eternal nothingness? Either way, what harm would it be, to be called back to the living, breathing world for a short time, even if only in the form of a skeleton? What soul, trapped forever in slumber, would not welcome the chance to wake and briefly return to the world he once knew? The hideous cackle that you hear – could it not be a peal of delight? That dull, unearthly moan – could it not be an utterance of joy – or an attempt to express gratitude, at having been granted a chance to taste life once again? Who is to say?</p>
