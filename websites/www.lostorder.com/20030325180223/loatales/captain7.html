<p align=left>Captain's Log: Wintersebb 17</p>

<p align=left>Today started out with rain, lots of rain.  Its almost as if all the bar
mades that have gone on to their final rest were a cryin' fer me.  Once
again I shouldered my quiver of arrows and made fer the depths of the
abandoned distillery.  Its almost becoming a routine fer me.  I guess that's
why I got a wee bit cocky today and got meself in trouble.</p>

<p align=left>Things were going along rather well down there.  I killed a good number of
gnawer shreths and some minor drudges.  I was startin' to feel me oats and
get a little bolder.  I rounded on corner, walked down a ramp to the bottom
of the distillery, met up with the biggest drudge I've see to date.</p>

<p align=left>Well bein' that I'd had some ale with breakfast, (and she wasn't all the
fillin' er um,. never ye mind that) I thought to meself, "all the others
I've found I've easily turned to pin cushions, lets give this bloke a try"
So I notched and arrow and let it fly.  The bugger pulled the arrow right
out of 'is chest and started stabbin' me with it.</p>

<p align=left>I came to at the lifestone on the eastern outpost of Lytelthrope.  Not bein'
one to give up on me pyreals and ale that easily I ran back to the
distillery and hunted down that bloody drudge prowler.</p>

<p align=left>This I repeated three times.</p>

<p align=left>I did finally get the bugger, with the assistance of a mage I met along the
way.  The fella didn't talk much, but then again we were both a little busy
with the drudges and shreths at the time.  Once that prowler was dispatched
though I was able to recover me coin and beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<p align=left>I ran all the way back to the Roasted Shreth in Lytelthorpe, where Selfora
the barkeep 'elped me bandage a few, quite painful, wounds.</p>

<p align=left>In good news, Selfora insits that I lay up a few days.  After all I'm one of
her best customers and she'd hate to have all that stout go to waste if I
should really get put down fer good.  All I have to say it thank goodness
fer them blasted life stones!</p>

<p align=left>Also somewhere along the line I collected near 500 pyreal!  T'was most
profitable, althrough I got handed me gizzards more than a few times.  Also
I'm finding that some of me skills in fletching and archery are returning,
though I think its more new skill that returned old.  Still I can kill most
shreath with a handfull of arrows, which is quite an improvement.</p>

<p align=left>I hear tell on the rumor mill that the forces of light are gathering again
in Nanto to help clear the countryside of evil.  Mayhaps I shall heed the
call and head there meself, though I would need to find another of the
cursed portals to take me there I fear.  Ah well, I'll safe those troubles
fer another day.
