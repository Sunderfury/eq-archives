<p align=left><b>My Norrathian History</b><br><i>by Sunmoon Solusterra</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Leaning against the tree, I am impressed with the amount of shade this giant fir manages to produce. The trees of Surefall have always brought peace after a days long journey. Surely Tunare had a grand vision when she fashioned this place. </p>

<p align=left>Glancing around the Glade, I casually watch a few fellows trying their aim on the practice target. One nocks his arrow and lets fly a perfect shot, piercing the center with ease. The second lad, not to be outdone, steadies a bladed arrow to his weathered, yet strong longbow. With uncanny aim, the archer sends the arrow towards the target. A sharp crack is heard as the blade deftly slices the first arrow to the point. Laughter erupts and I overhear one gentleman say, "Now if ye could only hit a moving Gnoll!" "Ah, yer Father can't even hit the side of that Inn o'er there," taunts the other. </p>

<p align=left>My thoughts begin to slip... A deep sigh escapes my lips as I drift into thoughts of my parents. I still remember the day my mother came bursting into my room, the tears flowing like so many tiny streams. "What is it mother?" I try and calmly ask, fearing the worst of news. Barely mouthing the words, she whispers, "Your Father..." Jumping to my feet, I grabbed my scabbard and bolt for the door. "Stop!" she commands, and the fury in me subsides a bit with her tone. "Not even the best Clerics in the land could have saved him." "What has happened mother?" I ask, with a lump swelling in my throat. "'Twas a mighty rush of orcs came forth from Crushbone. The orcs had been incited by a recent hunting party violating their sacred land." </p>

<p align=left>She continued, her hands shaking, "Your father went to track a legionnaire that was spotted recently. Upon arriving at the small outpost of orcs outside of Crushbone, a mighty wave of orcs overcame him. He had no chance to survive as the mass of 20 orcs cut at him from all sides. A passing mage under the protection of invisibility witnessed the event and stood helplessly at the sheer number of the fiends. Upon seeing the carnage, he quickly teleported to our city and told the town Elders." </p>

<p align=left>A rage like none other turned my face the brightest of crimson. Sensing my fire, my mother placed her hand on my shoulder and bade me sit. Moments later, my sobs were muffled as my face lay buried in my mothers embrace. My 17 seasons of life had seemingly come to an end with the loss I was facing. Overcome with despair and tired from the day's work, sleep overtook me as my mother watched over her only son. </p>

<p align=left>Many hours passed while she went about the grisly task of addressing my fathers recovered belongings. Suddenly, a shout arose from the ground beneath our small shack. "The orcs have come!" Terrified, I jumped to my feet, unsheathing my sword in one slight move. I urged my mother to the back of the room and extinguished the lone candle on the table. Slowly, moving backward to where my mother stood, I moved my hands over the surfaces I had come to know so well. Passing near the table on the left, I felt the unmistakable outline of my fathers sword and silently whispered, "Mother, it is time I wielded father's blade!" When I entered my 17th season, my father had shown me of a new technique of fighting with two swords. Now, I thought, was the time I needed it most. </p>

<p align=left>I grasped my father's sword, feeling the history of it. He often said the sword emerged from the time of the Combine Empire and I could feel now that his words rang true. Shifting my Fine Steel Longsword into my other hand, I felt a magical presence in my right hand as the sword melded perfectly within my grip. Orcish cries became more prevalent as the sound of fighting grew louder. I could barely make out the guttural cry of "Emperor Crush!" coming from the foul things. All the while, the screams of friends rang deep in my ears. </p>

<p align=left>A faint sound at the front door got my attention as I silenced my mothers whimpering. As I peered through the darkness, relying on my natural ability to see in the dark, I saw the door cautiously swing open. A smallish orc, no doubt sent to scout out the houses, appeared in the doorway. I have heard of the orc pawns that plague the region for younger adventurers, but had not thought of them to be so foolish. Knowing that I could best him easily, I cry out, "For my father!" and lunge towards the surprised beast. </p>

<p align=left>The door is a mere 15 paces away, yet the orc has time to react since I foolishly yelled my attack. "Centurions, by my side!" he spouts with a blood curdling scream. I pause midstride as I see three hulking figures emerge from the darkness beyond. A quick glance causes my heart to pound as two centurions lumber towards me and then I see it, the undeniable garb of an orc emissary! A flash of lighting from a fast approached storm affirms this nightmare unfolding. My instinct overcomes fear and one swift strike from my father's sword extinguishes the pawns miserable life. </p>

<p align=left>I mutter a few elven words and watch as the roots ensnare the large emissary, slowing his progress. Alarmed with my quickness, the centurion's pause, considering what to do next. One quick bark from the emissary, however, and they resume their onslaught. </p>

<p align=left>I meet the first with a glancing blow to the thigh. The second spins around me, lurching towards my mother. A morbid fear infuriates me as I lunge at the second orc, bent on protecting my mother. The first centurion, noticing my back turned, lands a well placed blow to my right leg, tearing the leather leggings from it. Thank Tunare, the meager leather prevented the slicing of my leg. I quickly recover and land a swift strike to the centurion advancing on my mother. Amazingly, my off hand responds with a similar blow, knocking the centurion to the floor. I whirl as the other starts to swing, sidestepping the strike and land a stinging blow to the orc. Screaming in pain, the orc backs off a step. </p>

<p align=left>"Sun!" my mother yells. I turn around and see the first orc has recovered to his feet. "Argghhh!" I bellow. Arcane words erupt from my lips as a burst of fire begin to flash about my hands. With horror, I watch the orc raise his scimitar, an evil grin crossing his twisted face. My legs propel me with all the speed I can manage, interrupting my incantation, as the flash of the orc's blade cuts through my mother's chest. "Noooo!" I scream, watching my mother slump to the floor. A rage fills me as I mutter more words. The orc writhes in agony as the flame sears his body. One final slash with my sword and the beast falls lifeless to the ground. </p>

<p align=left>Pain wracks me as the first centurion crushes my left arm with his mace. My arm falls limp as I whirl to face my attacker. I cringe as I see the Emissary almost upon the fight. With a cry, I slash the orc and follow with a solid kick to his torso. Stunned, a look of fear overcomes the orc as he sees the rage in my eyes. Flame again erupts from my hands as the fire scorches the stunned orc. I lunge again, a massive strike from my blade tears the very limb from the dying orc. I follow this strike with a fatal blow to the neck of the doomed beast. </p>

<p align=left>Near exhaustion, I almost forget the now free emissary charging at me. He crumples me with a bash of immense power. As I am stunned, he punches me in the face, nearly blacking me out. When I slump, the orc looks bewildered at the sight of his fallen companions. Out of the corner of my eye, I see my mother, seemingly lifeless on the floor. The sight of her renews my fury and I leap to my feet. Quickly, I mutter the words of ensnaring roots and dash from the house as they take hold. The surprised orc stumbles towards me, barely progressing. </p>

<p align=left>Seeing this opportunity, I call on Tunare and her healing touch. The words infuse me with life and my left arm mends. The orc, still advancing is about 20 paces away. I quickly pull my bow to the front of me, loosing 3 quick shots. The orc screams in pain as the arrows pierce his pathetic robes. Seeing his pain I swing the bow around while chanting the words of fire again. Flame now engulfs the orc as he plods towards me. I run to the beast with a powerful kick to his sternum. The orc flails while my blades wreak havoc on his limbs. Knowing his death comes soon, the orc turns to flee, yet my roots have stopped him in his now fatigued state. With a deft swing, I behead the vile thing and collapse in sheer exhaustion. </p>

<p align=left>Mother! I crawl to the door of our shack, peering in at her still body. With my last ounce of strength, I pull myself to her side. She is alive! "Sunmoon," she whispers, "I am quickly failing." "No!" I cry, the tears burning the lacerations on my face. I summon the last of my mental energy and whisper the healing words and she is visibly better, yet, her wounds continue to bleed. "You are a brave son," she says. "Your father would have been so proud of you this eve." "Shhh," I say, and lay her head in my lap for comfort. Darkness surrounds me as I slip out of consciousness... </p>

<p align=left>Moments later a hand shakes my shoulder. "Lad! Are you ok?" I am startled and quickly look up. One of the villagers had come to check on us. He looks around at the bodies of the orcs and says, "You did this all boy?" "Aye," I reply, "they attacked my mother and I." I quickly turn to wake her. </p>

<p align=left>"Mother?' I whisper. </p>

<p align=left>"Mother?" as I shake her. </p>

<p align=left>"Mother!" I cry out feeling the cold touch of her skin upon my hand. "Lad, " the villager says, "'tis indeed a day of sorrow for you and us all." I peer up to him, tears welling in my eyes, "If you only knew friend..." </p>

<p align=left>"Sunmoon!" the guard says, "Stop sleeping in the Glade." I come to my senses and realize I had been thinking of my parents. "No my friend, I was merely thinking of days gone by" I say. </p>

<p align=left>"Why *do* you have that surname friend?" the guard asks. </p>

<p align=left>"Solusterra?" I inquire. "It means to be alone in the world," I respond, thinking of my loved ones gone. "There is much sorrow in this world friend and I am no stranger to it..." </p>

<p align=left>"Hrmff, " he mutters and walks off. </p>

<p align=left>I gather my belongings and set off, hoping to find the happiness that eludes me...</p>
