<p align=left><b>A Return Home</b><br><i>by Alavon Highwind</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Faces everywhere, grinning that evil smile that could only mean death. Coming closer, surrounding him, their breath infesting the air with the stench of hatred. Clubs raised, their faces covered with shadows from the flickering torchlight. Dark laughter drowns out the sounds of the night. The clubs fall swiftly toward their target, cowering on the ground, helpless. </p>

<p align=left>Alavon wakes up in a cold sweat yelling. "Just a dream, that same cursed dream. Must I be punished to relive that night for all eternity?" Alavon gets up from the bed assigned to him by the captain of the ship, and makes his way to the deck. Alavon leans on the rail of the ship, looking over the glassy seas that make up Britania's waters. "Wish there were a few trees around, but I suppose I'll live" thinks Alavon. "Ahoy mate!! Slept well I hope?", the captain hollers as he sees the elf. "Aye, I did sir. Thank you again for giving me passage." "Tis no problem lad," replies the captain. "We should be reaching the habor in about an hours time." "Thank you captain". Alavon once again looks over the seas as he contemplates what must be done upon his arrival. "I must find those mages, and then I shall receive what is mine." </p>

<p align=left>Safely upon the shores of Moonglow, Alavon thanks the captain and wishes him safe travels. Alavon pulls the cloak around him tightly, making sure to cover his face. As he nears town, he cannot help the chills that run down his spine as his mind thinks of the past. "I am mad to come here. Surely, this is the day I shall die." A crowd is gathered in field next to the armor shop, and here Alavon goes. A man is giving a speech on purity of species. Alavon's eyes widen as the white bearded mans eyes lock with his. The man stutters in his speech, and then excuses himself, citing an emergency had come up. Alavon quickly makes for the shadows of a nearby building, never taking his eyes off the mage. The man hurries out of town, making for his home. Alavon jumps the town gate and rushes through the woods that he knows so well.</p>

<p align=left>The mage hurries his pace, looking over his shoulder at every snap of a twig. As the man looks over his shoulder, he runs into something solid. Turning his gaze in front of him, he sees death. Alavon stands before him, kryss drawn, eyes burning with rage. The mage attempts to yell, but no sound emerges. Alavon grabs the mage and pushes him against a tree, the blade pressed against his throat. Alavon just stares into the mages fear filled eyes. "Seventeen years I ran from you, but I run no more. I've been wanting answers for my entire life, and now I'll get them. Where is my father?" Alavon says in a low, hate filled voice. "H-e's gone.." the mage replies. "LIAR!!!!" yells Alavon, the birds taking flight frightened by the sound. "Bring him back!!" "I-I-I can't. None escape the abyss." Alavon lowers his head, tears of pain dropping to the ground. "And of my soul? What of that? Can I be made whole?" asks Alavon in a weak, fagile voice. "Perhaps, but not by me, nor any other of this island. Your answers can only be found by searching, but if you search long enough, you just may find yourself." "One last question serpent. Why?" asks Alavon "Why? Why? It's painfully obvious. Your kind is a disease upon my race. I did this island a favor by ridding this land of your father", the mage replies. Alavons compassion immediatly leaves as he presses the blade at the mans throat. "You dare speak of my race and father in such a manner!!! Impudent dog!! Give me one reason why you should continue breathing the air?!!?!" Alavon screams. "Because you can't do it. You are just a scared little boy that lived longer than he should have. You're a coward." All that can be heard is Alavon screaming as the forest becomes dead silent. </p>

<p align=left>A cloaked man, shaking, walks out of the forest, eyes filled with rage and confusion. He nears the moongate of moonglow, clutching his head in pain as he nears it, and leaps through. Up the path where Alavon walked, a small steam of crimson can be seen staining the ground, as a limp body lies under a cloak of the same color. And the forest remains silent....</p>
