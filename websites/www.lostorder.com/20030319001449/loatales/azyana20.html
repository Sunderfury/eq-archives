<blockquote>
<p align=left>I haven't made much progress over the past few days since meeting my love's mother. I have been having the most difficult time finding a good group or any group at all. </p>

<p align=left>Some groups that I have joined…sometimes I think people are just in too much of a hurry. This one group I joined was more concerned about just getting in there and start hunting without the proper protection placed upon the tanks. It is good thing I had the good sense to cast invisibility vs undead upon myself or I would have surely died. Then this other group had the worst puller. We ran to the zone more than hunted since I kept having to heal everyone up and meditate. Then there was the one with a druid that never snared anything so someone always had to go running off chasing the creature and most time got jumped by something. Another group didn't want to wait to see how long it took for things to reappear before pulling things that we got so overwhelmed. Those days I just gave up and called it a day and would go off and walk or sit watching the peaceful water near by.</p>

<p align=left>Sometimes I would run into a tank that wanted a healer and it would be good. It seems that when it is just two people they are more cautious. I ran into a warrior new to the area so I inviz'd us both and took her in showing her the rooms she could try to pull from and those to avoid on the first floor. I just can't seem to pull only one from some places. She being a tank could easily take the punishment. We did good until this big train jumped us. The day had been frustrating enough, and felt all too long at that time so I cast all the protective spells I had upon her and wished her a good day. </p>

<p align=left>When I was not able to find a group I would wander about trying to find something and have taken to picking off things from a train that has been run to the zone. I would watch all them run by and then slowly to back to where they came from. As long as there wasn't a werebat around I could safely stand there and check the zone area. Once it was down to just one I would have at it an most times was successful.</p>

<p align=left>My love has been away trying to obtain a component for his quest armor these past many days and has not had much luck. If I could, I would cast a spell to make it magically appear in one of his bags while he slept. Since I can't maybe a small prayer that his search will be over with soon is in order. Ah well, tis best I learn to fend for myself , but I must admit I do miss the way he says goodnight to me before he leaves.</p>
