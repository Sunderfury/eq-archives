<p align=left><b>Morning Prayers</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>No one knew for certain just how old the great stone Ankh actually was, nor could anyone say who built it. According to the legends, holy men had found the symbol standing on a quiet grassy hill overlooking the sea. The place was declared sacred, and a small stone chapel was built around the stone. Then, in later years, a great hall was added – and in time, an entire cathedral. Today it is known as Empath Abbey, one of the most impressive structures in all of Britannia. But at its heart lies a small stone chapel, and within that chapel the Ankh still stands. In times past, the faithful would come here from all over the world to visit this enduring relic of Virtue. Nowadays, the faithful are few and far between; most simply run past the chapel on their way to the bank vaults.</p>

<p align=left>But to those few who do seek peace and enlightenment, the chapel still serves as a quiet haven of sanctity. The ancient stone walls guard the silence within, just as they did when they were first built. Colorful tapestries adorn the walls, depicting the knights and priests who once devoted their lives to the defense of the land and its people. Morning sunlight streams in through the high windows, bathing the chapel’s occupants in a pleasant cascade of warmth and illumination.</p>

<p align=left>Most of the occupants, anyway.</p>

<p align=left>------------------------------</p>

<p align=left>“I hate mornings,” muttered Santiago. He squinted in the glaring light, exaggerating the dark circles beneath his eyes. The sunlight felt as though it was burning his skin. His back ached and his head throbbed – and he hadn’t even had anything to drink last night! Even without hangovers, mornings were too much to bear. “Now I know how vampires feel,” he grumbled.</p>

<p align=left>One of the other monks turned around and politely motioned him to be silent. Santiago glared at his back and resisted the urge to push him off his pew. He didn’t see why monks had to wake up so bloody early, anyway. Why couldn’t morning prayers wait until later? But then again, he thought, the good Lard must be awful busy, running around on his mysterious errands. Maybe he was on a tight schedule, and this was the only time he could be reached?</p>

<p align=left>Santiago knew he should be thinking about Virtue and all sorts of other holy things, but all he could think about was his nice soft bed, and how good it would feel to be back there, beneath the warm blankets, cozy and snug, drifting…off…to…sleep…</p>

<p align=left>In a few moments, the tiny chapel was filled with the sound of snoring. Jacob glanced at Santos. “Should I wake him?”</p>

<p align=left>Santos turned around and looked at Santiago. The former pirate was dozing peacefully, his head slumped against the wall and his mouth hanging open. The friar shook his head. “Let him sleep, the poor soul. He’s not used to waking up this early. Come, let’s help him back to bed.”</p>

<p align=left>Several passers-by stopped to stare as the monks carried Santiago down the hallway toward the sleeping chambers. It wasn’t easy work for the poor priests, who weren’t quite as young as they used to be. They entered the first room they could find and unceremoniously dumped the new acolyte onto the bed. Santos gently drew a blanket over him, then he shut the windows and quietly closed the door.</p>

<p align=left>“He’ll wake up eventually,” said Santos. “I suspect that he’s been through a lot lately. It must have been something dreadful, to have forced him to go so far as becoming a priest.”</p>

<p align=left>“Do you think he seriously wants to become one of us?” asked Jacob, frowning apprehensively.</p>

<p align=left>“I believe he thinks he does,” said Santos. “But I also believe that there is something behind this sudden burst of religious zeal. One does not transform from pirate to priest overnight. No, something happened to him…something he does not yet wish to reveal. In time, perhaps.”</p>

<p align=left>“Father, I know that I should be patient and charitable, but…what if Santiago does more harm than good? Forgive me, but the man is a walking disaster. I’m almost certain that he will bring ruin to us, in one way or another. I’m half-afraid that the Abbey itself will collapse if he’s inside it.”</p>

<p align=left>Santos laughed. “Well, if that should come to pass, we shall simply rebuild. Don’t worry, my friend…Santiago is not as dangerous as you might believe. I doubt that he will give you any problems.”</p>

<p align=left>Jacob blinked a few times. “Me, sir?”</p>

<p align=left>Santos nodded. “I must go away to Britain for a few days, and while I am gone I would ask you to take care of Santiago. See that he does not stray too far from the path of Virtue.”</p>

<p align=left>Jacob’s lips moved, but no sound came out. His face was ashen white, and his hands trembled.</p>

<p align=left>Santos smiled patted the terrified young priest on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, Jacob…I’m sure that the Abbey will not collapse. Farewell, and may the Light smile upon thee.”</p>

<p align=left>“Farewell, Santos.” Jacob glumly stared at the friar as he left. He once heard a tale of a lone traveler who lost his way in a haunted forest, his fate sealed with the approach of night. But only now could he truly appreciate the dread that the lone traveler must have felt. Watching Santos depart was like watching the sun fall, and he knew it was only a matter of time before misfortune reared its drunken head.</p>
