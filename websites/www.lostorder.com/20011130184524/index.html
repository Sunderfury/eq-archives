Note that how they version the program has changed.  The second number now denotes a version that does not significantly change to graphics or game engine.  That being said, here's whats in the new version, straight from the mouth of Mo.<br><p><p><p>-We re-enabled the J key for riding trucks. troops can jump off at any time again, however, we also added a velocity check when they do, and lets just say it can be "dangerous" to leave a moving vehicle. Troops can also be "thrown" from trucks and tanks if those vehicles impact buildings or trees etc at speed. And again, being in a vehicle mishap can be very nasty for riders. As well, troops can be run over and killed by vehicles again.<br>-We redid all of the map icons with less saturation. The map should look a lot better now. We also gave the in-game map a transparency setting (you can change the setting using "settings.exe" and the "misc" tab). In that same tab in the settings app you can select if you'd like the mouse on or off at spawn as a default.<br>-We redid all in-vehicle screen display text to a font that is much less "horrible".<br>-We redid all the icon display technology, they should look sharper and function better, and aircraft types or player Ids won't show until the IFF color draws. This will make ID'ing planes a bit more fun.<br>-We fixed the bomb collider to detect high altitude drops more effectively.<br>-Crew members on multi crewed planes can now red/black out.<br>-We added an in-game clock, tied to the game time of day (use "numlock" to view)<br>-The Bf109/Bf110 elevator trim changes are now visible in the 3d model, also aileron droop on flap deployment is modeled.<br>-We improved the mobility on the 47mm AT gun, it should be movable over most terrain now.<br>-The P38(t)'s machinegun is now aligned with gunsight<br>-The P38(t) and PzIIIf's ammo loads were revised to match historical loads<br>-The Char B1's hull machine gun has been realigned<br>-We added new interior main gun sounds for most tanks.<br>-We added separate color for squad-member icons, these will show white for now, and we will eventually allow players to set this color in the settings app.<br>-We added a forced exit after death. This basically shift esc's for you after a timeout.<br>-We changed the red-out at wounding effect to be less opaque, so unless you are almost dead, you'll still be able to see a bit.<br>-We enhanced the "Death Cam" feature to be a bit more dramatic.<br>-We hunted down another cause of the yellow flags, these should now be fixed. <br><p>Also mentioned in a different post, is a major crash bug fixed.  Apparently data was not matching from the player to the server  (the sever wasn't getting what it thought it was getting).  This has been "tortured to death" as Mo was quoted as saying, and should make the game a lot more stable.<br><p><br>Merad<BR></font><p>

       <font size="2" face="verdana, arial" color="yellow"><a name="6912428"></a><b>Several things to mention</b><br>LOA is having a blast in Dark Age of Camelot. We have about 40 members and friends involved in the fun thus far. We currently range in levels from 8 to 21. We are making every effort to create a trade system, better grouping organization and preparing our members eventually for Realm vs Realm combat. If you are interested in learning more about LOA's presence in Dark Age of Camelot, please visit our forums and jump right in (<a href="http://www.lostorder.com/forums/" target="_blank">click here for forums</a>). One of the very great things we have experienced is that our allies from other games are also playing on the same servers as we are. We have had the pleasure to group with BCK and STC. <br><p>I have heard word that our Asheron's Call chapter leader purchased a cottage in Dereth. With housing now in AC, our members will most likely have a place to gather and socialize (much like our village in Ultima Online). Congrats to Enosh for procuring the cottage and sharing the place with fellow members. <br><p>Several members of our guild received notices in the mail regarding Shadowbane Beta 3. We updated our profiles and are now awaiting the next step. I have to admit that DAOC took the wind out of my SB sails... but after seeing new screenshots of Shadowbane, I am looking forward to giving it a test drive. I can tell that a hard decision will be facing me in the coming months... I love Dark Age VERY MUCH. The game is just incredible and tons of fun to play. Shadowbane has HUGE potential to be equally incredible. Decisions... Decisions...<br><p>That is all I have time for today. I hope to post again soon with more updates and events that are taking place in LOA.<br><p>Brimstone</font><p>

And lots of it mister!</img><br><p>  The Rats over at CRS have been working over time on the little spinny wheel thingy that rats like to run on.  *Ahem*<br><p>What I mean is that an official announcement on 1.3 has been made.  According to the Rats we should see it monday.  This means unfortunatly, that you won't see 1.3 before pay to play, which was schedualed to go into effect the 14, this Sunday.  Fortunatly the Rats, wise creatures that they claim to be, has pushed back the pay to play date by 1 week, giving all potential noobs the chance to give it a go before they give their credit cards a go...<br><p>  Aside from this announcement several items have been popping up on the site includeing several new screen shots, and of course the requisite Gryf updates on whats going on in the production department.  Of the greatest interest to me, was a new video by Bushman, that really demonstrates the new terrain objects in the game.  I particularly took interest in a scene that shows what appeared to be a 38t rolling behind a shrub line.  Looking at the barrel of the tank, one notices that it doesn't quite match the current 38's profile.  Maybe that new tank we are getting in this patch isn't allied...<br><p>  Overall it looks like a 'hail Mary' patch, and I'll stop now because I need to towel off my keyboard before it shorts out.<br><p>Merad<br>(News or compliants?

I'll give a brief rundown and translation:<br><p><p>The code for bombers is done.  The test build can now handle multiple engines, as well as variable bomb load outs.  Also, a counter has been added to keep track of clips for guns that use them. (Thats clips, not bullets.)<br><p>AI auto guns can now be selective of the targets they engage (choosing a truck full of soldiers over a tank).  Plane convergence has been tweaked, and is now set at 200 meters.  (This applies to planes with guns on the wings.  Guns don't shot straight on the wing, rather they aim slightly in toward the propeller to allow the bullets to all focus in on one particular point in front of the plane.  This allowed maximum hits to the pilot if he could get an enemy plane in that spot.)  <br>The front end is modified with the addition of a radio channel that reports whenever a CP is captured.<br>[This is a big one]<br>The game engine has dropped the super cell in favor of an octet cell.  For the mortals amoung us, a super cell means that while in the game, the engine draws a huge area around you and keeps it in memory.  AC uses this method, it allows for easy tracking of objects that could affect a player, but more importantly, its what makes moveing from server to server seem seamless.  This is why the game can take up so much RAM. With the new octet-radius system only a slice is kept in memory, namely, what the player can see.  The game then constantly scans the situation to load what you are about to see, and forget what you no longer see.  This system should reduce RAM usage a good bit, but the trade off will be higher CPU usage.  Shouldn't be a problem for anything over 1k htz.  (Thats a semi educated guess though, read the post on Support Systems and Terrain for details.<br><p>And finally, (this is a really good bit here) troopers no longer suffer from the 'get a scratch, fail the mission' syndrom.  For those who don't know what this is, currently the mission scoring system in game is very simple.  If you kill something, return to base and despawn without damage you gain mission points.  Do this about 30 times and you gain a rank.  Obviously this is very difficult to do, even in a tank, because despite having armor, a scratch on ANY of the crew results in mission failure.  The community thinks this is a pile of gerbil droppings as a whole, and fortunatly, CRS agrees.  <br><p>Basically the new system awards a mission success if you haven't lost a set amount of blood or gotten hit in the brain.  (This is called a critical system, I tend to agree with the name.)  In a vehicle, you not only have to worry about you and your crewmens bodies losing too much blood and brains, but also you have to worry about what systems on the tank have been hit.  Some systems (criticalprimary, or critical systems) knock you out of the mission immediatly...  such as losing your engine.  Less important systems like a gun are non critical (criticalsecondary) and won't knock you out of a mission unless you lose to many of them.<br><p>Again head over to the forums for detailed reading.<br><p><font color=green>And now for something completly different</font><br><p>All computer geeks rejoiced the world over today as <a href="http://www.civ3.com">Civilization III</a> goes gold!  The release date is set at the end of this month.  (Electronics Boutique reported Oct 28th)  This game is notable not only for its predecessors long and glorious history, its new twists and innovations, and its overall Sid Meyer coolness factor/polish, but also for having the ugliest racial leaders any game has seen since Star Control II.<br><p>What I'm looking forward too the most in this game is the boundry system, and its improvement over the Alpha Centauri boundries by letting you not allow other civs to plant cities on your territory.  ( I was forced to wipe out so many civs that way... tsk. )<br><p><font color=green> But here is more!
