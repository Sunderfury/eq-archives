<font face = "arial" color = "#800000">Hail my friends. I had hoped that it would be a pleasure for me to be able to come read the board for the first time in two weeks. However, I see that a couple of terrible terrible things have hapened while I have been gone. I am very disappointed with the conduct that has been going on on this board. I realize that bards as a whole are a very opinionated group. However, it is very sad that this has caused some of our best minds to come to blows. I fought hard before I left to get Minuette to stay with us, as she is a wonderful member of our community. But bickering seems to have made this fight futile. When I first tried to rally people together on the Barding 101 board to get a barding guild together, I knew there would be hardships. However, these are hardships we can avoid. I know that everyone has opinions on this board, and by all means not everyone will agree. But please please please do not let what happened between Minuette and Darius happen again. We have already lost two good people, and we cannot afford to lose anymore. <p>On a lighter note, I see that some wonderful things have happened as well! I have only had time to read but a few of the posts, but I am very pleased with some of the events and ideas. Kudos to Glam for introducing the proposals to be debated (though this is what caused the above arguments). It is great that you are finally sitting down and concentrating on ideas to get the UO world changed for the better! I would also like to congratulate Amber on her wonderful ideas for the Halloween celebration. I look forward to participating in whatever event comes about on that day! <p>Just in case any of you are curious as to how I have been doing, I have discovered that the life of a professional biologist is not nearly so exciting as I had hoped it would be. *chuckles* However, I am still managing to have a good time. I am looking forward very much to the day when I can return full time to UO and to CBA. But I should end this post here, since I am supposed to be working now. Good luck to all of you!<p>May the Avatar Bless Thee,<p>Nimue<br>CBA</font>
