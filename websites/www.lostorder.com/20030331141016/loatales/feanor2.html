<p align=left><b>The Seed of Darkness Blooms</b><br><i>by Feanor</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Feanor wandered into the brewman tavern, the patrons voices sounded far
off and dream like. With great concentration he walked over to his
table in the corner and sat down heavily. Painful memories flooded
his mind and he struggled to fight them back. He saw himself take 
a steak knife and ram it into the side of Velaska....but this is all
a dream it must be...everything around him seemed a dream. The darkness
overcame him suddenly....he was no longer in the tavern, but inside
his own mind surrounded by darkness. The darkness swirled around him
manifesting into characters of his past. </p>

<p align=left>"Feanooooor, you let us dieeeeeee, you let all of ussss dieeeee" came
the voices of his family, his friends, his beloved Galadriel and Elwing
they all closed around him, mocking him.</p>

<p align=left>"NOOOO!! That is not true!!" Feanor shouted out in pain.</p>

<p align=left>"You let your family and friends die Feanor....they are all dead because
of you!" Vyktr had appeared along with the ghostly images of his past.
Feanor crumpled to his knees and held his head.</p>

<p align=left>"No this is not true! this is a dream! a terrible dream!" Feanor shouted
back in defiance.</p>

<p align=left>"This is no dream Feanor you helped put them in their graves and now
only pain and hate remains in you! embrace what you are! embrace the 
darkness!!" The spectral host echoed Vyktr's words.</p>

<p align=left>"Nooo...." Feanor whimpered as he clutched his head as if protecting it
from unseen blows.</p>

<p align=left>"You killed us...You let us die..." The ghostly images began chanting,
softly at first then louder almost yelling at Feanor.</p>

<p align=left>Feanor weakened as the darkness closed in to claim yet another victim.
All hope seemed lost and Feanor had lost the will to fight back, then came
the ray of light. A brilliant white light that broke the darkness and
surrounded him. Feanor embraced the light and sought for its origin...</p>

<p align=left>"Tara...." Tara had sent a lifeline. The compassion and warmth of the
light filled Feanor and it grew brighter. The shadows screamed with
anger and tried in vain to grab hold of Feanor. Working the light
into a sword Feanor stood to face the darkness. Vyktr screamed in 
anger at the sword that now shimmered brightly in Feanors hands.</p>

<p align=left>"Fool! I offered you power beyond your wildest dreams! I offered to 
cure your pain! FOOL!" the ghostly images of Feanors past shied away 
from the blade.</p>

<p align=left>"Thank thee for thy offer, but I have memories of happier times
I wish to get back and have a lifetime of devotion to the Paladins to
live up to" A slight grin crossed Feanors face as he plunged through 
the darkness towards Vyktr.</p>

<p align=left>"Noooo!....." Vyktr threw his arms up as if to block the oncoming blow.</p>

<p align=left>The blade past through Vyktr diagonally from shoulder to waist. Light
poured out from the wound and grew larger and like a rip it tore the
darkness that surrounded Feanor apart. Light surrounded Feanor, memories
of old flooded through him, happiness, pain, hate...all of it enveloped 
him....he was whole again.</p>

<p align=left>.....</p>

<p align=left>Feanor slowly stirred from his slumber.</p>

<p align=left>"Where by the light am....." Feanor stopped short as he realized he
was in the tavern. Dream like memories from hours ago washed over him
....Velaska....did I kill her?...Feanors eyes fixated on Tara who
sat across the room.</p>

<p align=left>"You...I guess I owe you Shadow..." Tara gave Feanor a puzzled look.
Feanor in turn smiled back at Tara.</p>
