<p align=left><b>The Spell</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Urquhart had spent his entire life studying magic. Every possible earthly pleasure had sacrificed for one specific goal, a goal that was finally about to be realized. With a satisfied grunt, the wizard closed the spellbook and penned the final words on the scroll. With trembling hands, he held the parchment close to his weary eyes, and began to cast…the Spell.</p>

<p align=left>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p align=left>RewdDewd had spent his entire life learning how to kill people. In order to perfect his Art, he had abandoned every single Virtue. His conscience – an unnecessary burden – had likewise been discarded, along with all intelligence and wit. He was little better than a savage animal, preying mercilessly upon the innocent of Britannia. But he sure could kick butt.</p>

<p align=left>One day, while setting forth from his castle full of lewt, he chanced upon his trusted friend, Barry Manilow.</p>

<p align=left>“dood. s’up.”</p>

<p align=left>“s’up. wanna kill sum newBs?” asked Barry.</p>

<p align=left>“ya cool lez do it”</p>

<p align=left>The two metal-clad morons soon came across an old lumberjack, and eliminated the poor soul in less than five seconds.</p>

<p align=left>“%&$#. Y don’t these lamers have any good lewt?”</p>

<p align=left>“cause their lame ehhehhehh”</p>

<p align=left>“ya true i dont need lewt its just fun to kill”</p>

<p align=left>Just then, the Spell took effect. Without warning, RewdDewd and Barry Manilow suddenly died. In a couple of seconds, two ghosts appeared and began to moan and wail to each other.</p>

<p align=left>“DOOD WTF WAS THAT?”</p>

<p align=left>“dood i dunno but this sux big time”</p>

<p align=left>“ya i know. $%#!!! that newB is back he’s lewting us!”</p>

<p align=left>“&#$%!!! this isnt fair i’m gonna write to osi”</p>

<p align=left>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p align=left>Urquhart sat back in his chair with a satisfied expression on his face. If his spell worked, then villains all across the world would be toppling over dead at this very moment, with no hope of resurrection. His life hadn’t been spent in vain, after all.</p>

<p align=left>He walked outside his tower in the forest, able to relax for the first time in his life without the ever-present dread of murdering thieves. He smiled and looked around – it would be a whole new Britannia from now on.</p>

<p align=left>“Urquhart, wake up! Pay attention!”</p>

<p align=left>The mage’s eyes snapped open, and he found himself back in the classroom, listening to the boring speeches of old wizards. It had been a dream, of course. There was no Spell of Mass Dewd Destruction, and there probably never would be. All he could do was dream.</p>

<p align=left>The apprentice in front of him turned around and smirked. “eehhehe dood U got busted.”</p>

<p align=left>“Shut up, Barry,” said Urquhart, with a heavy sigh.</p>
