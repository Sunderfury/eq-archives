<p align=left><b>When the Light Penetrates the Dark</b><br><i>by Navrip</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Navrip stalked through the jungle, in search of the elusive thief that had stolen his amulet. He cursed himself. Why had he allowed himself to be so lax? It wasn't normal for him to be off guard, but he had let himself slip and it had cost him. He thought back to how it happened. He had taken the amulet off to recharge his energy in private. He hadn't cast any of the normal protection spells over it that he normally did. No thief had ever penetrated into his inner sanctum, so there was no worry. But one managed to, somehow.</p>

<p align=left>An alligator burst out of the foliage and let out an angry growl. It lunged for Navrip's leg and wraped it's powerful jaws around it. The crushing grip managed to penetrate Navrip's leg. It twisted, but the pneumatics in his leg were strong enough to resist the thrashing of the animal. Navrip's sword left its sheath and cut a swath through the air and directly into the animals head. The creature stupidly fought on in its death throws, so Navrip had to stab it a few more times before it fell. He kicked it off his leg and continued on his way, ignoring the superficial damage to his leg.</p>

<p align=left>The night came quickly upon him. The thief needed to rest and sleep, but Navrip had no such frailties of the flesh to contend with. He could concievably continue all night if he didn't engage in an extended battle or cast too many spells. His night vision lenses slid over his eyes, allowing him to detect the minute changes in heat in the night, much like elves and dwarves. </p>

<p align=left>He searched for an hour longer and finally spotted a small campfire burning. The heat of it's flames stood out over the sweltering temperature of the jungle. Navrip smirked slightly at the thought of getting revenge over the thief. He drew his sword and stalked silently towards the camp. He saw the thief, hunched over the fire with a hood over his head. Odd for such a hot place, but Navrip payed it no mind. So confident was he in his approach, that he failed to see the trip wire in his path. A virtual tree trunk flew from the darkness and crashed into Navrip's side. </p>

<p align=left>The impact lifted him from his feet and sent him crashing into a tree with enough force to crack the trunk. Navrip unsteadily got up, sure the noise from the crash would have alerted the thief. Amazingly, it didn't. Navrip regained his footing and headed back, watching for any more traps. No more presented themselves.</p>

<p align=left>He crept up behind the thief and put his sword to his back. "Foolish cur!" Navrip spat. "To think that you could steal my amulet. Hand it over now and I'll be merciful!" The thief moved not an inch nor made a sound. Navrip repeated the order. When a similar response answered, he reached down and grabbed the hood and pulled it off. </p>

<p align=left>Underneath was the corpse of a gorilla, dressed in the thief's clothes. Pinned to it's head was a note. Navrip ripped the note off and read it.</p>

<p align=left>You didn't really think I'd be that stupid did you? <br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
Rengarth the Thief<br><br>

PS... BOOM!</p>

<p align=left>Navrip's eyes narrowed at the last remark. Suddenly, his eyes widened in suprise as an explosion erupted from the gorilla. The force of it sent Navrip flying again. The heat and flames ignited his cape and damaged Navrip's insides. Navrip landed against a tree with a sharp crack. This time, it wasn't the tree that cracked. Navrip felt around his back. A long crack ran from the center of his back down to his knee. It sorely hurt him, but he had no concept of pain and despite all this thief's tricks, he was still a mere mortal.</p>

<p align=left>Navrip stamped out the fire and stalked off into the night again. His anger fueled his search. He no longer cared about being heard, he wanted this thief dead and his head on a pike. He picked up his tracks easily. Obviously, the thief expected Navrip to have been destroyed by his little trap back in the camp. The thought would almost be humorous if Navrip wasn't so furious. </p>

<p align=left>Eventually, he spotted the thief kneeling on the ground, as if he were checking something. Navrip unsheathed his sword and called out. "So fool, you thought you could escape from me and destroy me with petty tricks, eh? Well, now is your time to die!" </p>

<p align=left>The thief whirled around, shocked. His face drained of color when he saw Navrip. Navrip stalked towards him. "No!" the thief cried out. "No! Don't come any further!"</p>

<p align=left>"Fool!" Navrip spat. "You think you can intimidate me! Look at your face how it is flush with fear!" </p>

<p align=left>"No! You don't understand!" the thief called.</p>

<p align=left>"I understand enough to know that you will die!" Navrip returned.</p>

<p align=left>"Wait! We'll both be killed if you don't st-" the thief never got to finish his words. Navrip sprinted the last few feet and plunged his sword into the thief's stomach. Blood gurgled out from the thief's mouth and he smiled weakly. He looked up at Navrip with hatred in his eyes, right before the light of life left them. He crumpled to the ground. Navrip bent over to retrieve his amulet, but never had the chance. The ground beneth the two gave way and Navrip plumetted. He struck the ground and the light in his eyes winked out.</p>

<p align=left>The next day, a gentle voice penetrated Navrip's conciousness. "It seems you are awaking, eh friend?" </p>

<p align=left>Navrip knew not who would dare call him friend, but he did know that whoever did had probably saved him from that trap. His vision returned to him and he saw a human with a rough red beard and long red hair standing over him. At first, he mistook it for Tanis Half-Elven, but he then remembered that hero had been dead for years. </p>

<p align=left>"Don't try to move to quickly, your injuries appear serious," the man said. </p>

<p align=left>Navrip ignored him and sat up completely, ignoring the warnings flashing through his mind about his injured back. "And who would you be?" Navrip asked.</p>

<p align=left>"Who would I be? Well, I would be Lord British if I could, but alas, I'm not. The name's Hogart." The man extended his hand to Navrip in greeting. Navrip ignored the man and tried to stand, but found his leg unresponsive. He looked down and saw it wrapped heavily in bandages and splinted. The intentions were good, but they'd have no effect on Navrip. </p>

<p align=left>"Well Hogart, you obviously do not know who or what I am if you dressed my wound like you did," Navrip responded.</p>

<p align=left>The man chuckled. "Probably not! I've not seen civilization in a good many years. I'm a ranger by trade, protecting this jungle from harm. I'm suprised you managed to get rid of Rengarth. He is a thief, but he was harmless to the jungle, so I left him alone. Left many bodies behind him though. Can't say I'm sad to see him gone."</p>

<p align=left>Now it was Navrip's turn to laugh hollowly. "Well then, you have just aided one of your most dread foes." Now Navrip extended his hand in greeting. Hogart took it and gave it several hearty pumps. "Dark General Navrip Freemech at your service."</p>

<p align=left>"And why might you be one of my foes then?" Hogart asked.</p>

<p align=left>Navrip gave him an evil grin. He realized the amulet was around his neck. He held it up for Hogart to see. "Evil conquerer, destroyer of purity, and follower of the Dark Queen Takhisis, by trade," Navrip answered him. </p>

<p align=left>"Well then, I suppose you are my enemy. But I make it a point never to harm some one until they've harmed myself or the jungle I protect. And besides that alligator that tried to kill you first, you've done nothing to harm those things. And with that leg, I doubt you'll be harming much any time soon, anyhow!"</p>

<p align=left>Navrip muttered and ripped the bandages off. Hogart started to object, but stopped, realizing they did as little good as Navrip knew they would. His leg was nearly cracked all the way off. The splint was all that was holding it in proper place. Navrip tried to stand and succeded. But he realized if he attempted to stand on it for more than a few minutes, it would fail him. Navrip slumped back to the ground. "Well, I thank you for your attempt at helping my leg, but I assure you that this will not help it. I'm no more human than that rock over there, nor am I made any more of flesh than it."</p>

<p align=left>"I noticed," Hogart replies, nodding. "Well, what can you do? Is it permanent, or will it heal?"</p>

<p align=left>Navrip looked down at it. "It can heal naturally, though that will take a long while. This metal flesh may be able to heal itself, but it's slow doing so. I could actually fix it myself it if I had a hammer, some iron ingots, and a forge, but I doubt you have that, right?"</p>

<p align=left>Hogart shakes his head. "Can't say I do. Got no real need for any of those. I trade with other travelers when I need new equipment. Looks like you'll be on you behind for a while, eh?" </p>

<p align=left>Navrip growled. "Just take me back to Trinsic or Skara Brae. I'm sure I can find a blacksmith there to repair me."</p>

<p align=left>Hogart shook his head and chuckled. "Uhn uh. No can do. I never go near cities. Don't care for 'em all that much. You'll be staying with me for a while."</p>

<p align=left>Navrip's eyes flared. "I order you to take me to a city!" he shouted.</p>

<p align=left>Hogart chuckled again. "You're in no position to be giving orders. And with that leg of yours, I'm sure if you tried anything I could disarm you faster than you could blink. And don't think about any magic spells either, cause your reagents are gone. Don't look at me like that, I didn't take em. One of the jungle dwellers probably did. They saw your body and told me, but they had already rummaged through it."</p>

<p align=left>Navrip growled. He sat back and resigned himself to travel with this ranger, at least until his leg healed.</p>


<p align=left><b>Part 2</b></p>

<p align=left>It had been nearly a week since Navrip had woken in the care of Hogart. Despite his penchant for good and love of nature, the man had not been a bother to Navrip. Navrip had actually enjoyed hearing his stories. The man had a bravery that none would question and his skill with the blade impressed even Navrip. The man took down a party of lizard men without breaking a sweat or his skin. </p>

<p align=left>The man was relating one of his stories to Navrip one night, over a campfire. "So the dragon swoops down and Moris yells out 'You're mother was a pair of army boots'. Now, this doesn't go over well with the dragon. You have to realize, that this thing is easily forty feet long and has a very bad attitude. Moris continues to fling insult after insult at the dragon. It rushes him and tries to eat the poor bugger. Now, Jeffry was down from a claw wound, Traggarb was frozen in place by the dragon's spell, and old Murphy was all out of clerical spells and his mace was doing nothing. That leaves me and Moris to fight the thing and it was barely hurt. It goes to breathe fire on Moris and I rush him and push him out of the way. Of course, that leaves me in the line of fire, so to speak. Let me tell you, it was hot. Darn near welded my armor together. Now, I'm sitting there trying to put myself out while Moris is nowhere to be seen. The dragon stands over me and says..."</p>

<p align=left>Suddenly, Hogart trailed off. Navrip cocked his head to one side as Hogart stood and slid his blade from its sheath. Navrip almost asked him what he's doing, but suddenly, Navrip heard it too. Navrip stood and grabed his sword too. The sound of a ratman raiding party came through the air. Hogart had told Navrip of the creature's lack of respect for nature and life. They wouldn't fail to attack either of them. Hogart motioned for Navrip to stay put unless he calls for help, then silently disappeared into the foliage.</p>

<p align=left>Several tense moments pass, with no sign of Hogart. Finally, a rustling sound catches Navrip's attention. He turned to face it, thinking at first that it's Hogart returning. Instead, a huge lizard man leapt out of the foliage, straight at Navrip. Four others followed it. Navrip cursed, then uttered a prayer to Takhisis to watch over him. </p>

<p align=left>The large lizard man took a swing at Navrip. Navrip parried the blow, but the force of it knocked him off balance. Navrip took a few steps back, his leg threatening to collapse from under him. Two of the smaller lizard men came forward, one brandishing a short sword, the other weaponless. Navrip shot his sword out at the unarmed one, severing it's arm. It fell back, clutching the bleeding stump. The other one made a clumsy swing at Navrip with the sword. Navrip blocked it with his arm, then lunged forward, burying his sword in the lizard man's chest.</p>

<p align=left>The remaining three charge Navrip. The large one took another swing at him. Navrip barely blocked it and the other two lunged in with mauls, battering Navrip's sides. The big one took another swing, this time barely missing, as Navrip reeled backwards. Suddenly, his leg gave out from under him and he toppled to the ground, cursing.</p>

<p align=left>The lizard men rushed to finish him off when the sound of a bow firing pierced the air. Two shafts embeded themselves in the large lizard man's chest. It looked down at itself stupidly, then toppled to the ground seconds later. The other two, seeing their champion fall and the arrival of reinforcements, fled into the foliage. Hogart emerged, with a sour look on his face.</p>

<p align=left>"The 'raiding party' wasn't even real. It was just a lizard man that used to be good at imitations. I see now it was a distraction," Hogart said. He bent over and looked at Navrip's leg. "Looks like it might take more time to heal there. All the cracks that were gone seem to have reappeared."</p>

<p align=left>Navrip waved him off. "It doesn't matter. I owe you a debt for saving my life. Now, finish the tale of how you survived the angry dragon. You were at the part where you were getting breathed on."</p>

<p align=left>Hogart chuckled. "Right you are. Now, the dragon stands over me and says..."</p>

<p align=left><b>Part 3</b></p>

<p align=left>The simple but eerie beat of the drums filled the jungle air. Navrip and Hogart crouched low in the bushes, watching on as a small tribe of lizard men. The shaman of the tribe, covered in ceremonial paints, grabed a young hostage and draged her up to the altar. The lizard man made a few gestures and the girl screamed her lungs out.</p>

<p align=left>"We've got to save her," Hogart whispered. He kept his eyes focused on the wretched display the whole time. A look of hatred filled his eyes.</p>

<p align=left>Navrip noded solemnly, weighing their chances of an all out assault. With his still healing knee, the chances looked pretty slim. "We can't attack them outright and hope to survive. At least not very long. I say we come in from the sides and rush the altar-"</p>

<p align=left>"No," Hogart said. "There's not enough time for that. They'll kill the girl and we'll not get anything accomplished. I have a better idea." He pulled a small whistle from his pouch and blew on it. Navrip detected a low pitched sound coming from it, though Hogart seemed not to hear it. Several seconds pass where nothing happens. Just as Navrip gets worried that what Hogart tried won't work, the trees came alive with movement. </p>

<p align=left>Navrip looked up in time to see tens of angry gorillas leap out and into the lizard man camp. They yelled and screamed and brandished crude clubs as weapons. The lizard men guards turnws to meet this interuption of their ceremony. Hogart whispered, "Now," and darted forward. Navrip followed, quickly on his heels. </p>

<p align=left>The apes provided a sufficient distraction. Only minimal resistance turned up to stop Navrip and Hogart's advance. One lizard man with a club leapt up and quickly goes back down, sans head, by the blade of Hogart. Another pair lunge for Navrip, but one sword swing and a kick later, they are both crumbled on the jungle floor. Finally, the guards drive off the gorillas and turn their attentions to the other invaders. </p>

<p align=left>"Save the girl! I'll hold them off!" Hogart ordered. Navrip noded and charged the altar. The priest held up his dagger, a long, curved blade more ceremonial than battle worthy. He slashed it at Navrip, but the blow glanced off his chest. Navrip lunged with his sword and gashed the shaman's arm. It dropped the dagger and started to chant arcane words. A fireball erupted from it's fingers and struke Navrip in the chest. He shruged the magical energy off and lunged at the now immobile shaman as it cast another spell. The blade sunk into it's chest and it slumped to the ground with a piteous cry.</p>

<p align=left>The girl, paralyzed with fear, objected none at all when Navrip scooped her up. He looked back to Hogart, who's being overwhelmed by the lizard men. "Hogart!" Navrip yelled.</p>

<p align=left>"Run! Save the girl!" Hogart screamed back. Navrip reached down and ripped the pouch from the dead shaman's belt and sprinted away from the fight. He only had to stop once, to dispatch a rat man who had wandered into the lizard man camp. When he got sufficiently far from the camp, he set the girl down.</p>

<p align=left>"Stay here," he ordered. The terrified woman nodded weakly with tears streaming down her cheeks. Navrip looked in the bag and sheathed his sword. He rushed back to the lizard man camp. When he arrove at the outskirts, he saw a lizard man run a spear through Hogart's side. The man collapsed to the ground.</p>

<p align=left>"No!" Navrip yelled. He chanted some arcance words. A whirling dirvish of blades popped from thin air amidst the lizard men. The blade spirits instilled enough confusion in the ranks to give Navrip a chance. He rushed forward and scooped the dying man up. Blood bubbled from Hogart's mouth. </p>

<p align=left>He continued to run back to where he left the girl, ignoring the growing danger from his leg. If he stopped, the lizard men would surely catch him. Finally, he made it back. He laid Hogart on the ground and checked him for vitals. There's a faint pulse, so Navrip knows he's not too late. He overturned the remaining contents of the reagent bag into his hands. He chanted arcane words and healing energy flowed over Hogart's body. The blood flow stopped and his breathing returned to normal. The remaining reagents shriveled and dissolved in Navrip's hands. "The debt has been repayed," Navrip muttered. The strain on his leg too much, Navrip finally collapsed.</p>

<p align=left><b>Part 4</b></p>

<p align=left>Another month had passed since Hogart and Navrip had rescued Lindsy, the lizard men's intended sacrifice. The girl was very kind and had thanked the two profusely. They helped her get back to the escort which had lost her. Navrip almost went with them, until he noticed the mark of Unter Brae upon their armor. He cursed his luck and resigned himself to stay with Hogart a while longer.</p>

<p align=left>This time, Hogart had slunk off, following the tracks of some one he believed to be a poacher. He had ordered Navrip to stay behind, but Navrip had decided to trail behind him. Eventually, the crafty ranger allowed Navrip to join him properly. They finally came upon the camp of the supposed poacher. Hogart ordered Navrip to stay put.</p>

<p align=left>Navrip sat crouched in the foliage as Hogart went off to confront the poacher. After moments of silence, Navrip heard some muffled curses and the sounds of battle. His fear for Hogart's life rose, but the man hadn't called from help. Suddenly, the sound of an energy bolt ripping through the air filled the jungle. Hogart cried out in pain and Navrip knew was the time to act. </p>

<p align=left>He charged forward, exploding into the small clearing. A dark shape loomed ahead, standing over Hogart's prone, but alive, body. Suprise flashed over the face to see Navrip charging at it so. It stood there stunned for a moment, then raised it's arms to cast some sort of spell. It was too late, however, as Navrip crashed into it, tackling it to the ground. </p>

<p align=left>Navrip stood up quickly and whipped his sword to it's throat. "You do not attack my friends and live!" Navrip sword.</p>

<p align=left>"Then you'd better slay yourself, cur!" a familair voice cut through the jungle. Shock filled Navrip's body. He looked down and suddenly realized the blue and black clothing and the all too familiar face. Here, at his sword point, was Smogg Azalin, the leader of the Infernal Cult of Necromancy.</p>

<p align=left>"I apologize, Lord -" Navrip started to say. A cry from Hogart cut him off.</p>

<p align=left>"No! Navrip, don't you realize what has happened? You've been given another chance! Think about the months you've spent with me, in the jungle. You could have left at nearly any time, yet you didn't! You enjoyed listening to my stories and hearing about my bravery. I saved your life, selflessly. You could have used those reagents from the shaman to save yourself, but you didn't! You used them to heal me. And now you rush to save me and are presented with one of the final links to your dark past. You've been given another chance at salvation, something not many people get. By jamming that sword through the foul necromancer's throat, you'll be able to turn to the path of light. Make the right choice Navrip."</p>

<p align=left>"No!" Smogg called. "The forces of light are weak and pathetic. Had it not been for you using your dark abilities to save the cur, he'd be dead now! Kill the wretch and help me to my feet. The Shadow Conclave has been up in arms over your disappearance! Azalin will have your head when he sees you, not to mention what Tempest will think. Kill him, so at least we can return on a successful note instead of the one you're being presented with now!"</p>

<p align=left>The words rang through Navrip's head. Time seemed to stand still. Salvation? It was a concept he'd never thought he'd ever hear. Kill the man who had tended to him for the past months? It reeked of hatred and unneeded violence. Follow the path of light? Something he had never considered. Follow the path of darkness? Something he had done, that left him an emotionless and despised shell. "My time with Hogart here in the jungle had been one of the few times I can remember feeling emotions such as concern for another, happiness, and true mirth," he whispered. "Serve the path of light? Bask in the same joy day in and day out? Saving innocents from those who would destroy them?" he murmered further. </p>

<p align=left>Images of his life, from his beginnings as Pirvan's alter-ego to his gaining of a seperate body. Images of the painful transformation into a MECH seared his thoughts. His pride at being accepted into the Knights of Takhisis, followed by the anguish of being demoted for honorable actions stung him. His accomplishments and failures on Sosaria, leading up to his fateful fall into the pit trap of Rengarth, which in turn led to the past few months. They all came to him now. His decision was made.</p>

<p align=left>His blade flashed and plunged forward, burying itself in the man's throat. The only thing that came from him was a small gasp of suprise. "Sorry," Navrip said to man as life flickered from his eyes, "it is my nature." Navrip looked into his eyes, filled not with hate and spite, but a profound sorrow. Those eyes would be burned into Navrip's memory.</p>

<p align=left>Smogg stood and brushed himself off. He only glanced at the dead body of Hogart before gathering up his possesions. "Come on," he said to Navrip. "I'll open a gate to Golgatha and the workers of Oblivion there will repair that leg for you." He chanted some words and a portal opened up. Navrip stepped through, not looking back once.</p>
