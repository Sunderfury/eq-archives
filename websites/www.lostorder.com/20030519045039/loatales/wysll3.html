<p align=left><b>Journal - Day Three</b><br><i>by Wysll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>My very bones ache with anticipation...for every step we have taken forward, it has seemed like we have taken two back. But we now seem to have made some progress.</p>

<p align=left>Rivervale...is entirely too green. About the only thing I can say positively about it is that a large portion of the populace still like to build their homes underground. Part of me wants to leave the inn and sleep in the tunnel from Kithicor forest...at least then I would be surrounded by living rock. The stone here is good and strong.</p>

<p align=left>Ah, but the events of today still rattle on in my mind. When I returned from my walk in the mountains this morning, Wyll had heard that our brother, Wenceslaus, would join us. I didn't believe him at first - Wenceslaus hasn't been seen in months, and I was sure he had not heard of our plight. An ill wind travels fast, I guess.</p>

<p align=left>We took the opportunity while waiting for Wenceslaus to hone our skills and ready ourselves for the journey over water. Wyloon, predictably, tried to set everything around on fire. I decided to meditate while fishing - it calms the mind while providing food. Wyndelle, of all things, washed his fire elemental pet. I didn't think you could do that, but he seemed to like it okay.</p>

<p align=left>Wenceslaus joined us, and there was much rejoicing. He was a little leery of joining us on our quest, as the guards in the cities we were bound for have little love for practicers of the necromantic arts. I have little love for his vocation, either, but I put that aside because he's family. We boarded the boat, and were on our way.</p>

<p align=left>Wenceslaus wanted to be brought up to speed as to what had gone on, so I gave him a quick rundown on the past few days events. He was skeptical at first, but I think he understands the import of the prophecy now. (I must admit, if I hadn't witnessed what I have, I wouldn't believe it either.)</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle must have nodded off in a corner or something, because he didn't get off of the boat in Freeport. (I still think he was snoring so loud he just couldn't hear us calling him...) A fellow gnome bound us to the area, and we debated what to do next.</p>

<p align=left>I suggested we try the wizard's guild, as that was where we heard our father was doing research in Felwithe. We resolved to go there, and both I and Wyloon knew the way. (Since Wyloon's sense of direction is known to be faulty, I led the way...hehe)</p>

<p align=left>We searched the guild thoroughly, to no avail. The humans either ignored us, or knew nothing of our father.</p>

<p align=left>We had resolved to ask some of the gate guards (with Wenceslaus maintaining a prudent distance, of course), when a halfling rogue named Naddwin actually tried to pickpocket Wyll!</p>

<p align=left>After we had recovered from our initial shock at his effrontery, we surrounded the hapless rogue, and questioned him. He slipped away and ran, but not before babbling about gnomes in Rivervale.</p>

<p align=left>Another clue! Our way was clear. We would go to rivervale and see these gnomes ourselves. We thought we could use a guide, though. Perhaps we would find one in a tavern.</p>

<p align=left>The 'HogCaller's Inn' was just the sort of establishment it sounds like - dark, dirty...the kind of place you'd expect to see barbarians in. And that's what we found.... two of them in fact, and from our own guild! Waran and Warelor were celebrating...well, it doesn't matter what, not that I really know whether it was Waran's upcoming nuptials, or Warelor's elevation to commoner.</p>

<p align=left>They agreed (reluctantly) to get us to Rivervale - and then all hell broke loose. I think Wenceslaus' invisibility spell had faded, because a patron of the bar by the name of Hyrill Pon called for the guards and started hitting Wenceslaus. We could not stand by and let our brother be assaulted by this unwashed human, so we quickly dispatched this Pon fellow before he could alert the guards. I truly regret the necessity of that. Not only was it a needless death, I think that the citizens of Freeport will not look on me quite the same again.</p>

<p align=left>We began our journey with no further incident, and Warelor gifted us with the Spirit of the Wolf, that we may outrun any danger. This sense of power obviously went right to Wyloon's head, as he promptly cast a fireball spell right at a hill giant! (That gnome's sense of humor just escapes me sometimes - he went running ahead of the giant, taunting him all the way to Kithicor forest.) Of course, this made it hard for the rest of us to get to the zone...</p>

<p align=left>When we regrouped in Kithicor forest, we were a little the worse for wear, but all of us were hale enough to continue the journey. We must have angered Waran somehow...he was muttering to himself as we set out.</p>

<p align=left>When we arrived in Kithicor, we were surprised to find out that the halfling guards were pretty much indifferent to Wenceslaus. This would make our task here much easier. Of course, knowing our luck, we relaxed too soon. I soon hear the ghostly voice of Wenceslaus in my head, decrying the injustice of his death at the hands of a denizen of Rivervale.</p>

<p align=left>I reassure him that the necromantic enchantments he has bound around his small frame will preserve his body long enough for him to retrieve his possessions. He says that he will return as soon as he is able.</p>

<p align=left>Wyll (since he is the most travelled of us) found us this room, since it was getting late. He would choose this inn - a wood roof, wood floor, and it's on *stilts* in the water! I cannot think of a more inappropriate place for a gnome to sleep.</p>

<p align=left>Maybe we'll find the gnomes that rogue talked about - I still don't think that our father is alive, but then...I've been wrong about other things. I pray I am about this.</p>

<p align=left>Brell, continue to watch over us.</p>
