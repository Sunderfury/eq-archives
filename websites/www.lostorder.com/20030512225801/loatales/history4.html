<p align=left><b>A History, Part II</b><br><i>by Anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>“It’s amazing what one can do with a metal bar and a little strength,” mumbled a shrouded figure as he brought the full force of his weight down on his crowbar. The latch snapped easily and fell to the ground, splashing as it collided with the puddle at the man’s feet. Ingenuity had always been a crutch for Stanic K’Vel. A quick wit and decisive action had saved his hide on dozens of occasions. </p>

<p align=left>He eased the gate to the sewers open and made his way into the dark, holding his torch before him. The smell was terrible, and he was not about to consider what he might be stepping in, but it was of little importance. Visions of prosperity and fortune awaited the conclusion of this escapade. </p>

<p align=left>“This is the big one,” he told himself. Months of careful planning and tedious preparation all came down to the present. He could do nothing now but proceed as planned. The task was simple enough and there was in fact little danger. He had studied the grounds and knew them well. </p>

<p align=left>He turned right, and later right again. The tunnel veered to the left and Stanic could just make out his destination. Parts of the wall were broken away here to allow hands and feet to grip. He scaled the moist wall, and hefted a small amount of earth upward. Stanic recalled the process in which he had excavated this particular area of the tunnel. Were his estimations correct, this would bring him out into a secluded garden area behind an old building. </p>

<p align=left>The garden was a few hundred feet from his real target, but was readily accessible and a secretive location that he knew would be deserted. Dowsing his torch and raising himself out of the tunnel, he quickly closed in on the shop. As he suspected, there was but one guard present. He looked a bit young for guard duty, but perhaps it was just the poor lighting or the rain that made Stanic think this. He made his way to the side of the building unseen. After composing himself, he quickly turned the corner collided with the guard, sending him to the ground with a dull thud. </p>

<p align=left>“Oh, I am terribly sorry young sir. Was in a bit of a hurry to get back to the party,” Stanic claimed in a serious and convincing manner. “Here, sir, let me help you up.” He extended his left arm towards the befuddled young man.</p>

<p align=left>“Thank you sir, this night has been a bit…” The youth dropped the ground in silence, a dagger embedded in his throat.</p>

<p align=left>For a moment, Stanic’s eyes were fixed on the fresh corpse’s countenance. His mind drifted back, back to his own childhood. Glimpses of a life left long ago, shattered in grief and misery. He thought the guard to be no more than fifteen years of age. At that point in his life, Stanic had already become Trinsic’s most wanted man. A witty remark had urged him to draw blood for the first time. After a short scuffle, four men had lain dead about the floorboards of the Rusty Anchor. This was the beginning of a life filled with hatred and enmity. Stanic shook his head violently in effort to remember what he was doing.</p>

<p align=left>No scream had been uttered, no unusual noise made. He removed a key ring from the slain man’s belt and began testing each key on the door. The lock clicked and the door creaked open. Stanic strode in and shut the door. “Now to make this worthwhile,” he commented to himself. A wry grin crept over his face as he began shoving gem after gem into a large bag.</p>
