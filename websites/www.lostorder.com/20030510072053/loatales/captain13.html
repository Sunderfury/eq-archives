<p align=left>Captain's Log: Solclaim 7</p>

<p align=left>I received word today that those of the Lost Order that have found
themselves in Dereth are planning on meeting in Nanto in roughly a weeks
time.  To that end I figured I'd best be on my way there, since it's a good
long journey from Rithwic.</p>

<p align=left>In an effort to make the trip a little shorter I hopped the portal from
Rithwic to Shoushi.  The more I travel those blasted portals, the more I'm
getting used to them.  Still I'm much happier travelin' the lands on foot,
after all the journey is half the adventure, right?</p>

<p align=left>Still it would take the better part of a fortnight to get all the way from
Rithwic to Nanto by foot.  Either that, or I'd have to forsake the relative
safety of the roads fer the wild lands between cities.  So once again I
found myself starring at the glowin' purple gateway to Shoushi.  This time
my tab at the Royal Firkin was paid up, so I didn't have the extra
"motivation" to jump through the portal.  Still somehow I found the
willpower to step through that portal.</p>

<p align=left>I found myself just outside of shoushi again.  I must say, the place looks
beautiful as ye look down from on the city from one of the surrounding
hills.  I sat here fer a while marveling at Shoushi, laid out below me.  My
many recent trips to the nearest life stone have taught me to appreciate the
world I'm livin' in if nothing else.</p>

<p align=left>After a time of relaxin' atop of one of the many hills around Shoushi, I
decided to head into town for a visit.  I figured since I was here I could
take the time to sample the sake, and other local delicacies.</p>

<p align=left>As I made me way into town for a night of drunken debauchery I ran across
Kieran Windrunner, Tasslehoff's sibling.  Seems Kieran has been practicin'
both alchemy and fletching.  He handed me two quivers of arrows, fer me to
test for him.  One, a large quiver of broad headed arrows should prove very
useful the next time I go hunting drudges, and the second a quiver of fire
arrows will be priceless if the prophets of doom are half right of the
coming crisis.</p>

<p align=left>I was very appreciative of Kieran's efforts, and would have stayed to buy
him an ale, but there was a small issue of me behavior the last time I was
in shoushi that I had forgotten about.  Seems the local bar maids didn't
forget though.</p>

<p align=left>I guess it was for the better though, since it saved me a long walk to
Nanto, but I managed to stumble through the Nanto portal on me way out of
town.  Also fortunately for me the citizens of Shoushi decided not to follow
me though.  So for now I await me brothers and sisters of the Light in
Nanto, where fortunately I am as yet unknown.</p>

<p align=left>Oh my achin' head!  I feel as though I've been dumped in a pit with a pack
of hungry armadillos!</p>

<p align=left>Tonight me brothers and sisters of the Lost Order of Akalabeth met in the
Southern End Tavern.  It is always good to see me friends gathering in one
place to share tails of adventure and such, tis always good to share a drop
of ale with them too.</p>

<p align=left>Talk tonight varied between who else may have found their way to Dereth, to
what weapons pack the most bite.  After a time we decided to explore the
remote areas to the north east of Nanto, and mayhaps make our way to
Hebian-To by way of the wilderness.  To me this sounded like it had the
makings for a grand adventure and with the elixir of courage coursing though
me veins I was all fer a bit of action.</p>

<p align=left>As normally happens with such endeavors, it took some time for everyone to
gather their equipment, their courage and themselves at the eastern Nanto
outpost.  Once that was done we set out.  The group of us, including Joxer
the Mighty, Kelsam, Sunder, Wyll Walaryn, and Orion Red, set off eastward.
Along the way we killed many shreths and other beasties with great ease.
Our group was very well balanced with several warriors, a couple mages, and
a couple of archers.</p>

<p align=left>It didn't take us long to hack, slash, cut, stumble and bleed our way to the
coast.  Now I fer one have never had any luck hunting on the beach.  Seems I
always wind up catchin' me guts after getting' hit in the head by a golem of
some sort, or being liquidated by some azure gromie.   Well this time was no
different.</p>

<p align=left>We were actually doing very well fer a time.  Several gromies, golems and
other nasties fell before our swords, spells, and arrows.  Still when a pair
of golems decided to team up, it was trouble.  I ran as I usually do, but
this time I couldn't run fast enough.  The mud golem managed to catch me
from behind, hammering the back of me skull such to send me flying forward...</p>

<p align=left>...and into a tree next to the Nanto life stone.  Still I was undaunted, I've
met untimely demise on the beaches before, and I wasn't going to let one Mud
golem stop me.  I got me bearing and headed off to catch up with me maties.</p>

<p align=left>I don't remember too much of what happened next.  It was all a blur of pain
and fire.  I figure somewhere along the way to the beach I must have found
something really bad because of the char marks on me armor.  When I finally
came too I was face down in a ditch on the outskirts of Hebian-To.  I hope
me maties didn't meet a similar fate, but I'll have to look in on them
another day.  Today I need a drink, and bad!</p>
