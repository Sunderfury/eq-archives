: Hail my comrades - tis been a long long sojurn in the lightless realms for me, I am most glad to return, although I expect few of you noticed my diasppearence.

: The Conservatory seems to be in decline, on Pacific anyway. I could not find a Guildmaster to replace me before I left and our membership has fled in the absence of leadership. Now the very house which once housed the stone is gone to us and we are faced with extinction!

: I implore some Compassionate soul to aid me, I have not been in the Britannia that is called Pacific for some time and I have no-one to call upon. Thus I am reduced to pleas.

: I have re-located to Skara Brae as Trinsic when I last saw it was infested with the dread legions of the Enchantress. If any wish to seek me out I am living upon the kind charity of the proprieter of the Shattered Skull.

: I am glad to be back at last and hope to once again disturb the mordant blather of the banks of Britannia with my songs and speeches.
