<p align=left><b>A Walk in the Woods</b><br><i>by Guardian Armond</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Guardian Armond awoke early in the morning and set out into the woods to
talk with the animals and monsters that he now what able to befriend. As he
wandered he friended animals and monsters of all types he stopped at the
stable to check on the Dragon Honor.</p>

<p align=left>"Why is it Honor that ye will obey my commands yet in the wild a dragon
ignores my requests for friendship?" Armond asked. The Ash colored Dragon
replied " Tloer, Tis yermmer you lack of understanding of drogonish
reakdoy." Armond although understanding the meaning was disappointed in the
irony. Honor was telling him that he had yet to totally understand the
language of the dragons, yet when his master had adequately calmed the
beasts Armond then could communicate and command them.</p>

<p align=left>The Guardian wondered to the north of the stable talking with Dire wolves
and such and eventually traveled to the swamps of the new land. As Armond
chatted with the Giant Toads of the land from his perch on a cliff out of
the reach of there venomous tongues, something strange occurred. In the
distance the forests sounds became clear to him as if he had always
understood them. In the far distance he could hear a White Wyrm calling to
him. telling him that now he had achieved the status of a master tamer and
that soon he would understand all they had to say. Soon he would be able to
call out to them when they were enraged and calm them and befriend them.
Armond found himself reflecting on the past finally after six months of
intense training he had arrived. Finally he was a master animal tamer.</p>
