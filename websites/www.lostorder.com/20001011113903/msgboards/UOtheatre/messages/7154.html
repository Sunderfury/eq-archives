: 1.  you assume that a bard who doesn't peacemake, but only provoke and musicianship is a twink.  This is not true in enough cases to validate your point.  Each bard must decide for him/herself what skills fit into his/her character.  Not OSI, and not you.  If I am an evil bard, why the hell would I want peacemaking?  More specifically, why wouldn't I be as good (or better) than a less specialized bard?  Makes no sense.
