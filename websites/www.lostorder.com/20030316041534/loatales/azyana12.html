<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Twelve</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I awoke this day with the mindset of working on my skills. As always I prepared my food and drink and cast Center and Holy Armor upon myself. I inquired if anyone had seen my golden one about and the response was no. I had no sooner resigned myself to hunting alone than he left message that we would be with me soon. I don't think that he knows that he can turn my darkest days into that of light and joy just by being near.</p>

<p align=left>Again our time together would be short this day, our world to rest and for all of us with it. Ready to begin I went out and fetched a few spiders, ghouls and mummies. Resting in between I had some questions for him as always. One was what I had forgotten to ask last eve and that was what would happen if I got interrupted when casting Divine Aura. He reassured me that I would be able to cast it as many times as need be until successful but once cast awhile before I could use it again. Another question was about healing while fighting. Sometimes I get disrupted so often that I still have a lot of mana but my health is failing. He said that it is always a tricky call, if you have a lot of mana left then I should heal myself and there was no point in dying with unused mana. It should also be cast before my health is too far-gone as I may have to cast it several times and may die. In some cases it would be best to cast an offensive spell. He further noted that as I am healing myself that I am not attacking the creature but it will continue to attack me so try and start the heal just after creature hits me to lessen the chance of disruptions. (ooc note: use the tab key to switch between yourself and the creature you are currently attacking). I told him that I was trying to figure out the pattern of the creatures attack some hit for two pause... hit again ... pause. He told me that most attack patterns seem to be one major attack followed by one or more lesser attacks but it does vary from creature to creature.</p>

<p align=left>Those tactical questions answered I asked him something more important to me than anything else and that was how much longer do I have to train before I can stand by his side in battle. He told me that I must reach the 35th circle of knowledge to do that. My heart sunk. Not wanting to talk more I went out to fetch something. It was getting very difficult to find something that was not below my ability there. He told me that was the reason we must go home and I should start hunting in Unrest. He continued and told me that although we will not be grouped we will be able to hunt by each others side as there are some things still challenging to him there. That made me feel somewhat better but the thought of us not able to go forth and do battle together still made me sad. I guess he saw my face and told me that some day when I get a little older we could do a few training mission to learn group tactics. I would not get experience but then I would learn things that will allow me to join groups and advance. I liked that idea since I will be well prepared when I am able to join him… well, once I reach the 35th circle.</p>

<p align=left>The message from the gods was shouted for all of us to hear that it was time for all citizens of Norrath to rest. With that, we said our good byes and here I sit again writing, as always it seems, wanting to capture what the day has brought to me. The sky grows dark and it is time to rest.</p>
