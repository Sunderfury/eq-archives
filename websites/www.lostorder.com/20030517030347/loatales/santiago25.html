<p align=left><b>The Knights' Oath (An Interlude)</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Trinsic has not always been a snakepit. Once upon a time, it was a haven for knights and paladins, and for all those who strove to challenge the darknesses of the world. Its practice yards were filled with the sound of clashing weapons, as warriors trained themselves to battle iniquity. Its armories echoed with the ringing blows of blacksmith hammers, as strong arms forged strong weapons to be used against the orc hordes and other threats that lay wait in the surrounding countryside. The sandstone walls of the city rose high and majestic; it was an impregnable fortress, a last bastion of light. It was often said that, should the world ever fall entirely into Shadow, that Trinsic would be the last city to succumb. Its knights would stand together on that last day, raising their swords in proud defiance of Evil. They would stand shoulder to shoulder with each other, down to the very last blow. They would never surrender.</p>

<p align=left>That was Trinsic at its finest, in the days when Virtue was not something to be scorned and mocked. But the world has a way of changing on us. Sometimes we can see the change occur, as with an approaching storm cloud. But sometimes change is not so easy to notice. Sometimes its arrival is so gradual that we don’t even recognize it at first, until we wake up one day and realize that the world is a different place. Sometimes change is the thief in the night, creeping in on us while our eyes are closed, taking from us what we value most. So it was with Trinsic.</p>

<p align=left>To this day, one can say why the knights vanished. Over the years, their ranks thinned and dwindled until there were only a handful. Some believe that an evil influence swayed them from the path of Light, twisting and corrupting them to serve Vice. Others believe that they simply got tired of fighting against an evil that could never be conquered. For in truth, what candle can burn forever?</p>

<p align=left>But whatever the reason, Trinsic’s sun had set, and it was not long before the city was engulfed by shadow. Where there had once been honorable knights to patrol and safeguard the city, now there were heartless thieves who seized every opportunity for dishonest gain. Foul brigands soon transformed the northern road into a gauntlet of terror, to be traveled only by the brave or foolish. Trinsic became a nightmare of avarice and cruelty, and there was no one to save it anymore.</p>

<p align=left>And yet, there are rumors. Every town has its rumors, you see. Tales told by the elderly – words whispered through weathered lips, from faces lit by flickering firelight on a cold, dark winter’s evening. One such tale is that of the Knights’ Oath. For those of you who do not know, an oath is a sacred promise, a solemn vow that can never be broken. Some of the townspeople believe that the knights will one day return, to honor their promise to protect Trinsic. According to the old legend, there will come a night when the ghosts of all the fallen warriors will rise, and march silently upon the City of Honor. There they will seek out and slay all of the wicked, dishonest people that now live within its walls, until the sandstone streets turn to rivers of red, and pour all of the polluted blood into the sea. The Last Clarion, they call it – the day when Trinsic will at last be freed from the curse which has come to stain its once noble name.</p>

<p align=left>Superstition, perhaps. Maybe just a chilling tale, inspiring either fear or hope, depending upon the sins of the listener. So many stories are nothing more than stories. But sometimes…</p>

<p align=left>Perhaps only time will tell.</p>
