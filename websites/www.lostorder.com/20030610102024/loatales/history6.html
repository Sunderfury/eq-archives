<p align=left><b>A History, Part IV</b><br><i>by Anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>“This way!” a deep voice echoed through the woods. The rain had made tracking difficult, but by no means impossible. He galloped forward, hoping to not lose the trail.</p>

<p align=left>Stanic stood panting heavily behind a large oak; he had almost gotten away clean. He clenched his fists around an arrow that stuck in his side and broke off as much as he could bear. “So this is what pain feels like,” he thought to himself. Despite a decade of criminal activity, Stanic K’Vel had never once been wounded. Flashes of injuries that he had caused in the past crossed his eyes. The resounding thud of hoof beats brought his focus back to reality. In one swift movement, he swung a heavy metal rod into the neck of the charging guard. His body lifted into the air briefly and the horse reared. Stanic instinctively leapt from behind the tree, ripped the gorget from the guard’s throat and brutally brought the pointed end of the rod down upon the exposed flesh. It would have been perfect had the horse not made an indiscriminate amount of noise.</p>

<p align=left>Every guard within earshot now came speeding toward Stanic. Ignoring the agony of his wound, he bolted away, sloshing through puddles, bounding over roots and through branches. An arrow whizzed by his ear and stuck firmly in the ground several paces ahead of him. Wracked with pain, he stumbled to the ground. Vivid images of what had gone wrong ran through his mind. A flawless exeunt marred by the presence of and unexpected second guard. The way the guard’s eyes glared upon him, his expedient yell for help, and the sudden silence as Stanic’s long sword impaled him. The torrent of cavalrymen that charged forth after him and the thunderous sound that it made.</p>

<p align=left>Stanic recovered his senses and raised himself up to his feet. He continued running, and was closing in on a clearing. The shrill whistle of arrows followed him, imbuing his side with pain and causing his face to wince in expectation of a mortal wound.</p>

<p align=left>Music and laughter filled the air as he entered the vicinity of the clearing. Stanic crashed through the last layer of trees and shrubs, bounding into the clearing. Cries of joy and laughter were instantly replaced with shrieks of fear and worry. Blood now covered a good portion of Stanic’s side as well as his face. An abomination of brown and red ran possessed amidst the crowd. </p>

<p align=left>Matrick instinctively ran for his sword. Calvar saw this and seized him, fearing that perhaps he was the blood soaked man’s cohort. “Let me go!” Matrick demanded, “I must get to my sword!” His intentions were nothing but good. The thought that someone would seek to disrupt this night, this most perfect night, was unbearable and brought an incredible rage over his body.</p>

<p align=left>Calvar and some others quickly held down Matrick. Stanic meanwhile seized a young girl and began back his way out of the clearing. Some horsemen arrived, and began moving slowly towards Stanic.</p>

<p align=left>“Halt! Leave the girl and be on your way,” evoked an imposing figure emblazoned with a captain’s sigil.</p>

<p align=left>“I would not take thy word anymore than you would take mine!” Stanic retorted amidst pants and wheezes. “This assures my escape, lest you would take this child’s life.” He increased his pace backwards. “Now turn around and go back home. Your presence only endangers her more.” </p>

<p align=left>Stanic fell backwards, stumbling on a small child who had been curled up and sobbing behind him. Without looking, Stanic roared and with his hands wrested life from the young girl, and kicked the small boy in the back as he darted off into the woods. From the stormy sky, a piercing bolt of lightning rocked the earth and the mounted warriors were immobilized while their horses regained their composure.</p>

<p align=left>Calvar and those who had been holding Matrick had released him during this incident. Matrick quickly found his sword and charged after Stanic. The chase dragged on for an eternity, Matrick driven by rage and Stanic by instinct to live. The rains increased and the earth rattled as bolts of lightning waged war with the ground. The two scaled the mountains of Covetous, moving closer and closer to the perilous sky.</p>
