<p align=left><b>Midnight Wanderings</b><br><i>by Spyre</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The breeze, cool and dark, rushes across my body, turning my head to the west. I quickly close the door to my little house, so as not to allow Peter to run off.</p>

<p align=left>As I wander through the trees of the forest, listening to the sounds of night, I begin to recall the dreams that have tortured me so. The stranger on the roof, the look in Atlantia's eyes, and inevitably, the blood soaked morsel of bread. Strangely, I've no recallection of feeling fear, or apprehension at the sights and feelings I'd encountered, only relief. If I concentrate, I can still taste the tangy saltiness of the blood, as it dripped to my anxious tongue. The mere thought of the bread, the dripping bread, brings with it a sensation I've never felt…almost a…yearning. I quickly shake the thoughts from my head, as I hear the telltale grumble of an ettin to the west. I've no weapons or armor about me, so I slowly back away to the east, not wanting an engagement with the powerful beast.</p>

<p align=left>When I'm sure that I've lost the Ettin, I sit on the steps of a darkened house to rest. Looking up to the stars, I see the familiar shapes I've grown accustomed. "Beautiful, are they not?" I hear a voice say. I snap my head to the left, seeing the same stranger that had been on the roof of the Architect house. Over his shoulder, I see the darkened shape of the peach trees in the Ville…but I was just miles south of here, and yet, I find myself on the steps of the Tavern. Confused, I look into the eyes of the stranger, seeking answers.</p>

<p align=left>"Come, my child, let us walk", he says, before stepping into the forest. I must know who this man is, and why does he call me "my child"? Getting to my feet, I rush to his side. Without a word spoken from me, he begins….</p>

<p align=left>"Spyre, you have many questions, this I know, but you must wait. Patience and curiosity are two of the most powerful traits that a man can have, and you must develop both of them, if you are to reach your full potential. I've a story for you, t'is a story of a man and a woman…</p>

<p align=left>The woman, born into the home of two loving and caring parents, and given the name: Lyla V'londria, was given all that she desired as she grew, with the understanding that none of it could last forever. She soon became a woman, as loving and caring as her parents ever were, sacrificing all for the sake of those less fortunate. She grew to love all men and women, forsaking herself for those around her, just as her parents did.</p>

<p align=left>One day, while walking the forest near Trinsic, she spied a young man sitting on a log near a steam. He looked to be a fit young man, strong, tall, and well featured. She walked up to the man, feeling no fear of him, and looked into his eyes as he turned. He invited her to join him in watching the fish. She agreed, sitting next to him on the log, and asked his name. "My name is Glyphton B'Llaal, of the Besai", he told her, half expecting a gasp of some kind, but not getting it. They talked well into the night, not noticing the fading sun. He told her things that no Besai ever told a mortal, unless he meant to kill her, but he did not have that desire. She was much too beautiful and kind for that. She made him feel a way that no other woman had, especially a mortal woman. He'd been told that he would be allowed three children, and three only. As was the way of the Besai, any more than that would be killed, along with the mother of the child.</p>

<p align=left>For weeks thereafter, they met in the same spot, by the same stream, on the same log, to talk and to hold each other's hand. He knew that his hand was unlike a mortal's hand: cold, devoid of heat, but strong to no end, and yet she was content and did not show the slightest hint of discomfort. For this he came to love her, as she did not care what he was, who he was, or whence he came; She only cared to be with him, and he with her. </p>

<p align=left>One night, in the faint light of the crescent moon, he went to her. Entering her home, in the guise of a shadow, slipping under the oaken door, and into her bedchamber, where he once again reverted into his natural state. Walking to her bed, he knelt on one knee, whispering her name. Upon hearing her beloved's voice, she awakened to face him. Not caring how he'd gotten into her room, she looked into his deep blue eyes, finding the love that she'd searched her life for. He gently caressed her cheek with his thumb, as he held her head in his massive palm, pulling her to him. She came willingly, wanting to feel his tender lips on hers, not fearing the beast hidden deep inside of him, but wanting only the man who she'd grown to love."</p>

<p align=left>The man stopped at this point, seeming to be lost in thought…….. remembering. I'd already figured out, by the look on his face, that he was telling me a story of his own life. This man walking beside me, is Glyphton B'Llaal of the Besai. He looked into my eyes, and knew that I knew.</p>

<p align=left>"We made love that night," he continued…"upon the rising of the sun, I left her house and her. I'd realized what I'd done, only too late, and felt too ashamed to look into her eyes. I went to her often, from afar, watching. I'd watched as the child within her grew, as she labored to help those around her, even as she herself needed help. Watched as those around her, the greedy self-serving people around her took advantage of her generosity, taking all that she had, leaving her with nothing. It was at that time that I left, leaving all of mankind to it's own greed and hate. I went back to the home of the Besai, back to the sanity of my home, leaving behind my beloved and a child that I knew to be mine."</p>

<p align=left>The Besai stopped in his journey to nowhere, turning to me. He grasped me by the shoulders, looking into my eyes. "You are that child, Spyre." The shock of the statement took my feet from under me, my mind going black.</p>

<p align=left>I awaken on the ground, looking once again at the stars. I stand, staggering still from the blackout. Looking around, the Besai is nowhere to be found…..again. I begin my slow walk back to the tavern…..thinking.</p>
