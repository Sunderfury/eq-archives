<p align=left><b>First Diary Entry</b><br><i>by Timbo Silvermist</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Had the oddest experience when I returned to Rivervale yesterday eve. Mayor Gubbin rushed me upstairs as soon as I arrived back in town. He and Sherrif Roglio were quite concerned about a "gang" of Gnomes who had been seen in the area recently, and they asked me to look into it.</p>

<p align=left>Now, I trust your average gnome about as far as I can throw him... which in their case is actually pretty far (I've tried; they're small). On the whole they're not bad folks, though I am concerned by all that tinkering with artificially created life-like machines they get into. It seems somehow so contrary to nature. Still, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so I suppose they are honoring Karana in their own way.</p>

<p align=left>Discovered them holed up in old Widow Burrfoot's home just outside town. With the exception of a shifty-eyed character named Wyxle (who I recognized from the Sheriff's Most Wanted list), they seem like a decent group. Still, the Mayor and the Sheriff HAD asked me to take care of "this Gnomish scourge" for them... and I WAS still officially a Deputy.</p>

<p align=left>*sigh* I remember when I still believed that my Squad Ring was an honor rather than a burden. How young I was! Sometimes I wonder where my kinsmen get their bigoted ideas... I suppose it comes from not getting outside of Rivervale enough.</p>

<p align=left>Anyway, when the Gnomes asked about transportation to Faydwer, well, it just seemed to good to be true. I could fulfill my duty to Rivervale while doing a good turn into the bargain! I gladly transpoted them and wished them well. They didn't say much after that... oh they were polite enough, but they didn't drop any clues as to why they had travelled halfway across Norrath, only to turn about and go home again. Somehow I don't think it was just for the Jumjum stew.</p>

<p align=left>I would chalk this up as simply another day in the service of Rivervale, save for one thing.</p>

<p align=left>I can't shake the haunting feeling that I'm going to cross paths with those inscrutable Gnomes again one day...</p>
