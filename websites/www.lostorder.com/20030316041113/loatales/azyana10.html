<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Ten</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I am at the inn in Freeport in a quite comfortable room. I can't help but have the biggest smile on my face while writing this. Tonight is the first night that my golden one called me 'my love'. Oh but I seem to be getting ahead of myself. </p>

<p align=left>I had just finished preparing for my night hunting when I saw Walterus pass by. We said our hellos and I told him that I was waiting for my teacher to come. He said oh he one that you do not have a crush on. I just replied my teacher. He went on to say 'oh the one that you are not in love with'. I think he knew how I felt for my golden one but of course I could not admit it. He seemed to be in a rush and then told me to tell 'lover -boy' that he said hello, and then he was off.</p>

<p align=left>I found a desert mad man, which was within my abilities and went after it. Well it was a caster and by the time I had figured that out it had already cast a few spells against me. I ran back to it and tried my best to prevent it from casting but it was soo hard. As I had just finished it off I turned around and there was my golden one with a proud look on his face. I was badly beaten but did defeat it. I asked him if he saw the whole battle and he said he did. He said once again that my tactics were correct but that it was my weapon that was at fault. It has a damage of 13 but a delay of 50. This was to slow to disrupt a caster. He also said I could disrupt the casting by casting when I saw it begin to cast a spell that a creature would stop hitting and then to cast when it cast. He then passed on a gift from Amarin, a new morning star that had a higher damage and a faster delay. For the life of me I can't remember what it is. At that point I was confused. A few days ago he told me that a 2hb would be better for me and now he is telling me to use this one handed weapon. He told me that I was correct in remembering that a 2hb is better but it was the one that I had was the problem and we had to find me a better one. </p>

<p align=left>I needed rest some more so I told him that I needed to ask him to explain what Walterus meant. I told him what Walterus said and my golden one said that Walt found it funny to make a joke at my golden one's expense. He then went on to say that he did not want me to be hurt because of it. He paused for a moment then as Walt has others might come to their own conclusions about our spending so much time together, and make comment. From the way he spoke I knew that he felt as I did. He seemed troubled by this and I assured him I would be all right and not to worry. I went off to hunt. </p>

<p align=left>I had hunted one creature and came back to rest only to see his face looking quite sad. It was like he was afraid I would somehow not want to be with him because of others teasing me, or by knowing that he cared about me. I could not stand seeing his face so sad so I decided to tell him how I felt. I had to stand behind him and asked him not to turn around. I told him I could not stand to see his face if he did not like what I had to say. I gathered all my courage and told him that I thought of him more than just a teacher, rather someone I had come to truly care for and love. He did not respond and my heart sunk. I then told him that I had best go. And then… he stopped me. He told me that everyday we spend together his affection for me grows deeper… that he did not know where it would lead but if I left his life then he would just vanish. I was so elated that now we could speak of our love for each other. So excited that my buffs had fallen. I cast Center and Holy armor upon myself and went off to find another creature. I think my feet barely touched the sand as I ran about looking for something. I was just so happy to hear that he cared about me as deeply as I did him.</p>

<p align=left>I rushed about trying to find something to kill just so that I could sit next to my golden one again to rest. I heard him cast his spells upon someone and after he had finished he said to me 'As a cleric you have the power to bring joy to all, never hold it back when you have the mana to spare'. That is just so like him….</p>

<p align=left>I don't know what we were talking about but he asked me if it would be okay with me if he called me 'my love'. I was ready to burst with joy! 'Of course', I told him. What two words could sound more beautiful than those two… my love. Ever the teacher he saw a passing ghoul and I dispatched it quickly and returned to his side to rest. He then talked about our trip home. He asked me if I would mind meeting his widowed mother. At that moment I knew he truly cared about me, and I told him that I would be honored to do so. Then he went on to say that there are a few things that I must do to prepare for our trip back. Wanting to make a good impression I asked if I should bring different clothing. He paused for a moment then told me that perhaps I should since his mother may not be approving of the sheerness of the tunic that I now wear. I told him that it might be best if I brought along my bronze breastplate. He agreed with that idea. </p>

<p align=left>It seems that was not what he had in mind for preparation. What he did have in mind is that I must learn the use of Divine Aura. I will have to use it as my health gets lower and lower under the safety of his watch so that when I need to do it in battle I will not be afraid. I know it is something I must learn. I do trust him. I am just so frightened. Maybe I will be sick tomorrow. </p>

<p align=left>The hour grew late and as always I can see it in his face and knew it was time for him to leave. We said our good byes and off he went again. </p>

<p align=left>I had not been back to Freeport in a few days and needed to go to the bank desperately. Since I didn't have SoW I decided I might as well swim back. I made it to Northern Ro and noticed that Mindayn was there. I asked him if he needed any protective spells. As we were conversing as to where to meet Dorn began his attack on me. I assessed him and he was within my ability but he hit too hard and too quickly and I was struck down a few yards from the safety of Oasis. All that work I had done gone. I memorized my spells, cast my protective ones on me and made my way back. I found my body and collected my possessions. Mindayn came upon me and so did Dearg. Dearg cast his protective spells upon Mindayn. I asked Dearg to not tell my golden one of what happened. I do not know how I will explain my slow progress tomorrow but I could not have my golden one knowing I died out of stupidity. Dearg just gave me a kind look and said it was already forgotten. </p>

<p align=left>I think Dearg knew that I was upset and told me it was not stupidity just part of being a dwarf and from that being stubborn. He then gave me some advice about named creatures. Even though they may seem to be within in ya abilities always fight them with someone else, and never battle them alone until ya have done it several times and know what ya are up against, and to always have an escape plan. Well, I seem to have gotten all of those wrong.</p>

<p align=left>I do hope that Dearg does not make mention of this to my golden one. He and my golden one are good friends. I just picture them deep in that dungeon… that they are resting and telling stories of this and that and then Dearg will tell a story to my golden one of how I got killed by Dorn. I think I'll just wait to see if my golden one mentions it.</p>

<p align=left>For now I do not have any worries. Tonight is the night that my golden one first called me 'my love' and the memory of this night will forever bring joy to my heart. </p>
