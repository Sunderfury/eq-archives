<p align=left><b>A Guardian's Tale</b><br><i>by Guardian Des</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>My name is Guardian Des I have been training since a very young age for one reason and that is 
to serve as a Guardian of the famed guild Lost Order of Akalabeth. This may sound like I am a 
servant but to the contrary, I am but someone who fights for what he believes in.</p>

<p align=left>Early on in my training, I ran into a Lord of much power by the name of Deathwish Dragon. He 
taught me skill in the art of taming this worlds wild creatures. I always found much solitude in the 
dark woods to the East of Yew so I went there trying to tame these beasts. Since then, I have 
found much enjoyment and peace among them. </p>

<p align=left>All was wonderful in this world until something very ...... well disheartening fell upon my great 
grandfather Descartes. He is an ancient mage who has been around longer than even he may 
know. For not many moons ago he had an encounter with the ruler of the underworld Hades, I 
know I thought the years of mixing to many reagents into powerful spells had gone to his head 
but his run in with Hades has warped him into a different being. His once great magery skill has 
not been anything of what it used to be. His once breathtaking use of the sword has faltered as 
well. His temper has flared to the likes I cannot even describe.</p>

<p align=left>I used to visit him in his hut in the jungles West of Trinsic. He would train me in casting simple 
spells to heal and cure myself. Now I am afraid to even send a carrier pigeon with a parchment 
his way in fear he may find out where I am, or be enraged further. After much thought, I decided 
to go by his hut last night.</p>

<p align=left>As I approached, the dreaded sounds coming from inside could be heard echoing through the 
trees. He was summoning and casting so much magic the whole hut seemed to glow. I could tell 
by the determination and anger in his voice that he was getting back all the power he had lost from 
his run in with Hades and more.</p>

<p align=left>He was screaming out things that I could not understand, words spoken in a foreign tongue. The dim 
candlelight coming from inside revealed smashed barrels, old bones, and boxes 
littered throughout the area. A foul smell I could not make out lingered as well. I brushed it off for 
I was in the jungle and dead beasts littered the valley. He was breaking bottles and throwing 
swords and axes around like a lunatic. Inside I heard a chest creak open and he was gone in an 
instant. </p>

<p align=left>I quickly ran inside to look for some hint as to what was going on. I saw against the West 
wall chests stacked upon chests full of weapons, potions, and armor. These were not the normal 
weapons he hunted with, these were crafted by some of the greatest smiths in the land. There were 
names forged into the blades by the like of Hellfire, Rehan, and Broog II. Other weapons glowed 
with magical energy and possessed such power I could not even pick them up. At my feet there 
lied a small green bag full of weapons drenched in POISON! </p>

<p align=left>This arsenal made no sense to me. For ages, he was a quiet mage who enjoyed hunting and 
comradery with his friends in LOA. Now it looked like he was ready to supply an army and go 
to war with all of the land. As I was about to run back into the woods to avoid an accidental 
encounter with him, I noticed a parchment pinned to the East wall with what appeared to be a 
daemons tooth. I started to read some of the crimson writings..... It spoke of an elite group of the 
Hammer of Akalabeth whom I have heard Descartes mumbling about in his sleep since a young 
age. This group was about to be declaring war on evil all across the land. Below it on the floor, I 
saw of all things a cattle iron, on the end of it the letters HOA had been forged. I picked it up and 
it felt warm to the touch. The horror hit me, that crazy old mage had branded himself with the 
letters HOA, the smell of the burning flesh still hung in the air. I was so terrified I just dropped 
it. I knew if he found me here my end would be near. I ran as fast as I could as far as I could, not 
even shutting the door. I do not even know where I ended up. </p>

<p align=left>I fear he left his meeting with Hades with more than a loss of his aged skills. What Hades had 
taken from him had left him an enraged mage with nothing but war in his soul. Hades theft had 
lit a fire inside him that was far from extinguished and I fear the fire may be growing. Fair ye well 
travelers for the oracles speak of a great battle of good versus evil. I believe the armies spoken 
of in this great battle are forming as I write this with my trembling hand.</p>

<p align=left>Good Luck to you all......</p>
