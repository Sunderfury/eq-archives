<p align=left><b>Personal Demons</b><br><i>by Yabbernox Flamebeard</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The old dwarf hefted his axe and glanced at each of the oncoming orcs,
weighing his chances. The centurion on the right would be the first to
fall, he decided as he dropped into his fighting stance. "Do not chase the
spider and let the mosquito feed," his father was often heard saying...Aye
he would follow that advice even here, and leave the larger of the two, a Legionnaire, for last.</p>

<p align=left>The orcs began to run as they drew nearer, and moved as if they wished to
flank the dwarf. Feigning towards the larger Legionnaire, the dwarf swung
his great-axe in an arc toward the Centurion, catching him squarely across
the middle of the back, severing his spine. The axe, however, became lodged
and as the orc fell dead the haft of the axe was twisted from the
dwarf's grip. As he futilely scrambled to free his axe, the dwarf was
suddenly knocked sprawling in the dirt by the force of the Legionnaire's
fearsome bash.</p>

<p align=left>Blows rained down on the dwarf as he struggled groggily to his feet.
Turning towards his assailant, the dwarf let loose a mighty kick, catching
the orc mid-thigh and sending it off-balance. As the orc regained his
footing, the dwarf drew his long sword and once again settled into his
fighting stance. Realizing its foe was no longer at a disadvantage, the
orc beat a hasty retreat and soon disappeared over a nearby hill.</p>

<p align=left>"Such a fight would only have been a warm up in me youth," the dwarf
muttered to himself. "I am getting too old for this!"</p>

<p align=left>After freeing his axe and ripping away a portion of the dead centurion's
tunic, the dwarf cleaned his blades. Glancing down at himself, he noticed a
small gash in the calf of his right leg...a gash he strangely hadn't even
felt. The dwarf pulled a bottle from his back and doused the wound with
dwarven spirits. Shrugging to himself, he then doused his throat and sucked wind through his teeth at the potent yet satisfying burn
that settled in his belly before spreading outward in fiery tendrils. As he
lowered the bottle, a glint of light on the nearby hilltop caught his eye...</p>

<p align=left>There was a familiar form standing up there...all too familiar.</p>

<p align=left>"Bloody, damned elf!"</p>

<p align=left>The form on the hilltop raised its sword in mock-salute to the dwarf and
then vanished over the other side.</p>

<p align=left>"Would that I could douse my heart with this as well," the dwarf sighed as
he finished off the spirits. "I am getting too old for this."</p>
