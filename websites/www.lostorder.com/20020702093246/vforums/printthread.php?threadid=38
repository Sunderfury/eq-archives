<p><b> Quest Report - Hieromancer's Armor (Part 1)</b></p>

<p>This week's quest went really well.  It was encouraging to know with a set of level VII buffs Sciurus <b>could</b> have taken all three training halls if he needed to but I was thankful he didn't have to try <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Around 2pm Loka Mar, Asha-Biton and myself gathered at the Lyceam.  (El-Sayed was around but unable to get to the lyceam)  After a few tries Mar and I managed to get into the same hall so we worked through the first trial together while Asha did the same in a different hall.  The first trial was quite easy, I don't think I had a single resist.<br />
<br />
I think it too around 10-15 minutes to get us all in the same training hall for part two.  This was made worse by the fact that I was trying to get both Enosh and Sciurus in the same hall as Mar and Asha so I could pick the chest with the boots of the vault.  This trial was a bit rougher for Sciurus, but with Asha and Mar's help we made it though pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Getting into the third and final trial dungeon was a good bit faster.  This time Sciurus got a full set of level VII buffs and was ready for some rock and roll.  Between Mar providing stamina and mana boosts, we managed to make pretty quick work of the training golems.  Sciurus is not the proud owner of an unkindled suit of war mage armor.<br />
<br />
Next week we'll journy into the Hieromancer's halls so Asha and I can kindle our war mage armor.  Please bring a friend as we'll need all the help we can get to blast through the halls.<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >__________________<br>
