<p align=left><b>As I stare upon the lake...</b><br><i>by Waran Rhinelander</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>As I stare upon the lake of Halas, all I can do is relax and ease my mind. I look upon its crystal clear waters and I am reminded of how my life has been changed with my dear Azlana sharing many an adventure together. I never payed much attention to these things until after that amazing night in East Commonlands when this beautiful Barbarian walked up to me and said "Greetins" for the first time to me. My heart nearly beat out of my chest when I looked into her eyes that wonderful night. I remember buying her some white wine at the inn after our Dark Elf Guard huntin' and made a toast. "To new friendships". I knew from that point on, Azlana was my match. Before I met Azlana, I wandered Norrath searching for my true self, I never knew where to venture, where to call home, I had been away from home for so long that, I honestly forgot about this lake and the wonderful people living in this city. And as I sit, fishing and staring at this wonderful lake, I've had a chance to look into myself and think about what truely makes my heart happy and where I belong. Azlana, you are my precious angel and you truely are the beat in my heart.</p>
