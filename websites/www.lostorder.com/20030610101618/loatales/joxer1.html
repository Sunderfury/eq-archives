<p align=left><b>Knight of Virtue</b><br><i>by Joxer</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Lord Joxer clutched the jeweled hilt of Soulforce, the legendary silver 
Scimitar of Vanquishing. Peering deep into the thick mists, Joxer stared
and waited for the next wave to come. His mithril plate glistened under
the early morning light - revealing crimson smears of fresh blood.</p>

<p align=left>The pain in his leg was intense and the bandages that covered the deep
spear wound hung loosely about his knee; but Joxer would not leave the
front. In the distance he heard the screaming of children - painful 
memories from a time long past when his village was destroyed; when the
place of his birth was burned and every beast, man, woman and child were 
slain. His children. His wife.</p>

<p align=left>He had chose the life of the sea for a time. Having made his name in the 
great oceans of Britannia, in his time he was the mightiest of all the 
pirates - rivaling the infamy of dastardly Baert the Black. It was toward 
the ends of these dark times for Joxer that he sought solace and an easing 
of the pain that plagued him. This was when he found the Order of Akalabeth.</p>

<p align=left>The snap of a twig roused Joxer from his thoughts. Gazing steadfast into
the dim distance, Joxer heard the moaning sounds of an undead servant. </p>

<p align=left>"Arr. So the Necromancer now sends her servants to fight. So be it, let
them come."</p>

<p align=left>Shambling forth out of the mist came the liche lord. Dark black with eyes 
of fire the beast lunged forward toward Joxer. But the Soulforce was true.
Joxer swung the mighty sword deep into the side of the abomination - black
jelly and rotting flesh spattered his shield as the blade cut deep. Staggered,
the Liche stepped back and summoned words of power to smite Joxer. Feeling
the hairs on his head rising, the Admiral raised his magic kite shield and spoke a prayer.
A long crackle and the smell of sulfur - a tremendous force of energy and flame
slammed into the Paladin's raised shield. The shield began to emit a low hum 
and the Liche's spell was suddenly reflected back at the monster. The Liche
was powerful, but not powerful enough to withstand its own spell; bone, flesh
and fragments of the staff the beast held exploded in a dazzling display of
fire and lightning. </p>

<p align=left>Joxer grinned, then wiped the gore off his magic plate.</p>

<p align=left>It was a fellow named Zael who warned Joxer of an approaching darkness. He 
Even heard rumors through his contacts within Castle British of evil deeds afoot 
In Moonglow, led by a dark mage well versed in the arts of necromancy.</p>

<p align=left>His suspicions were confirmed when he found the body of his beloved friend, Rahyl,
nailed to a large tree near Shame - a personal challenge to Joxer from this dark fiend. 
He had grown well versed in the arts of combat against the evil murderers and thieves 
of the land - this is undoubtedly what brought the necromancer to know him. He would 
be no trophy for this witch.</p>

<p align=left>In the distance further down the ridge, Joxer heard the battle cry of LOA. He was
brave, surely, but he was not stupid. He knew that the witch had recruited many evil 
humans to assist her in her quest and this is why he had brought three of his closest 
guildmates: Affliction, Palehorse and Littlewode. They were undoubtedly engaged in 
the same combats and he wondered how they fared. The price of glory is high, but the 
reward of knighthood is higher.</p>

<p align=left>And Joxer waited for the next wave of enemy soldiers. Dug behind a wall, the brave
LOA defended what remained of the farming village on the outskirts of Yew. And 
to the last man and woman they would stay.</p>
