<p align=left><b>To Heck's Doghouse and Back</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Here is my report of the very impromptu mission to Hythloth from last night.  Joxer, XoR, Leucothea, and meself gathered in the village and prepared to face to evils within that foul place.  Zirc was waiting fer us there where he scouted ahead.</p>

<p align=left>We entered the dungeon to find several rats and a great serpent waiting fer us.  The vermin were no match fer the lot of us, and we quickly exterminated them.  Once they were gone we ventured forth into the depths of the pit.</p>

<p align=left>Waiting for use just down the hall was Zirc, who had kept the hordes at bay while we made the journey there.  Now as a group of five we traveled further into the dungeon.  Our thirst for adventure was soon satisfied when we came upon a pack of hounds.</p>

<p align=left>I must say that having XoR along proved invaluable.  His music so enraged the hounds that they began to fight among themselves.  Soon the pack of hounds was no more than a smoldering pile of fur and grizzle.</p>

<p align=left>We journeyed a wee farther in and found a room filled with the varied hoards of Hades itself!  a dozen or more orcs and their captains, several ettins and a full eight hounds!  We decided that we would take care of a few other hounds in the area before opening that Pandora's box.  Much to my dismay as I filled a hound's corpse with arrows, one of the orcs grew some intelligence and opened the bloody door 'imself!</p>

<p align=left>Even the bravest warrior when faced with such odds will run, and run we did!  As we ran back, Joxer stumbled and was soon surrounded with the vile monsters.  I did me best to help him keep his head up by trying to get the attention of the hoard.  Me thinks I did a wee too good as soon I was surrounded and swept under by the massive hoard.</p>

<p align=left>As I watched from my color blind vantage I was treated to a sight of bravery and teamwork like no other!  Zirc lead a group of baddies away and lost them in the hall to the north.  Then he came back and fought side by side with Xor to slay the remaining minions.  Joxer and Leucothea fought as a fierce team, laying low hound after hound and spreading the entrails of orc everywhere!</p>

<p align=left>In what seemed an eternity, the hoards were finally beaten down and we earned a bit of respite.  Joxer restored me life's blood from a scroll he had on hand and we decided that it was a good time to return home to count the loot and lick our wounds.</p>

<p align=left>Everyone involved showed great courage and skill in beating back such an army of darkness in its own home.  Tis just one more reason I am proud to be LOA!</p>
