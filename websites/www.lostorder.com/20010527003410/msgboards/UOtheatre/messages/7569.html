<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">If you do take up wrestling, then read no further and stay on the morally acceptable road. Wrestling will raise your strength.<p>Now, if you decide to stray from the path, it is helpful to know that in the world as we currently know it, characters have a chance to gain an attribute at the same time they gain in an associated skill (and only then). If you, for example, juggled with "arms lore" (associated to strength and int) and "item identification", you would grow muscles and gain brain power rather fast. You'd have to be at the skill cap, then get item ID to 10.x points (you'll gain on failures too), then mark the skill down, and raise arms lore to the same level - then mark item ID up, and arms lore down... and swamp the 10 points again. Do this until you have the attributes you desire.<p>This is an ethically questionable way, and if you wish to play proudly and not feel strange about your own actions later on, do relay on wrestling as your source of strength, or adjust your style to your attributes as low as they may be. But you asked for the information, and I think everyone should have equal access to information so that they can make an educated decision. :)<p>-C.<br></font>
