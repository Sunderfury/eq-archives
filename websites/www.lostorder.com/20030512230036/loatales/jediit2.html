<p align=left><b>A Missive Relating the Experiences of Lumil and Myself in Lake Rathetear</b><br><i>by Jediit</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Steathily we crouched in the bushes, with our breath shallow; our minds focused;our weapons
covered to prevent a glare that would reveal our position. Lumil, being the accomplished mage
that he is, magically summoned a creature composed of the very earth we hid upon, all in the
hope that the Aviak patrol would pass by, as it had many hours ago.</p>

<p align=left>We had been told by the great ranger Sunmoon himself that Aviaks were known to send a lone
patrolmen...patrolbird i should say...and further investigation proved this. While neither the mage
nor my bardic self were even as skilled as the poorest ranger in tracking, we had stumbled upon
a place the bird routinely stopped for...personal matter. By the by, does anyone know how to
get bird droppings out of mage robes?</p>

<p align=left>Thus it was that we waited in ambush for the patrol to stop at their regular spot. To the shock
of some...i am not the most attentive of adventurers, and my mind soon began to wander. As 
i was gazing about the scenery, admiring the sparkle of the rising sun on the clear waters of the
Lake Rathetear, Lumil patiently kept watch. For hours upon hours we waited there...Lumil steadily
scanning the spots the patrol were known to dock their boat, myself drawing a rudimentary picture
of some marble statues of skeletons i found in some ruins a good distance behind us. Green they
were...so i believe they were made out of some sort of marble...yet i do not think marble is 
indigenous to watery areas...in fact i remember it is the product of compressed primal elements
found in the white hot pot of Brell Serilis, frome whence they would spew out of volcanoes and..</p>

<p align=left>A whistle distracted me from my musings. "What ever sort of bird is that?" i thought to myself.
My curiosity diverted, i wandered aimlessly toward the shores of the Lake...thinking it was some
sort of native water fowl my instructors at the Collegium had not known. What a coup that would</p>

<p align=left>*THUNK* went the arrow as it buried itself into the trunk of the tree next to me, inches from my
nose. Numerous other arrows buried themselves in the ground at the spot where i had been 
moments before, but luckily nothing is as fast as a bard in a flight of terror.</p>

<p align=left>With angry clucks and clicks in their strange language, the Aviaks rushed after me. Of course,
if i was more diligent in my linguistical studies, i would know what they were saying...but I had
left that for the brehons (those bards that would act as mediators) and for later studies. I just
HAD to see the world..and now i was seeing possibly my last glimpse.</p>

<p align=left>Screaming in terror, i rushed into an abandoned glade, where i found myself against a rock wall.
Interestingly enough, there were marble veins in the rock...perhaps my instructors had been in 
error...or maybe these were the fossilized remains of some great...</p>

<p align=left>The birdmen burst into the vale and rushed across, intent on my death. Panicked, i struck a few
discordant notes on my harp, unhooked my whip and unsheathed my dagger. (no i do not have
three hands...my harp hands from a strap so i can pluck it with an unoccupied finger...although
three hands would be nice) A ferocious, bellow shattered the vale's silence as I called upon the
vocal lessons of the Collegium. I was determined that i would not go down without at least
inflicting a painful welt or two...so i cracked my whip, lashing out at the birds' beak and vulnerable
throats. Undaunted, they strove forward, and i swear they were chuckling in their language.</p>

<p align=left>A GIANT CLAP OF THUNDER SPLIT THE AIR, and the birds were slammed against the wall as the 
great and wonderful mage, Lumil, let loose a violent burst of magical energy. Stunned, they were set 
upon by a vicious bard, intent on revenge (i swear they had called me a weak pot thumper....)
and a silent but nonetheless vicious elemental composed of earth. (no marble though)</p>

<p align=left>As we slumped down against the rock, the dirty work over and a smell reminicent of a roast 
chicken dinner causing us to slaver with hunger, Lumil managed to raise his head from his book
and look at me wearily.</p>

<p align=left>"That was a great plan, luring them into a false sense of numerical superiority and leading them
right to where i could hit them all at once. I am truly impressed, bard."</p>

<p align=left>"Errr...yes, I suppose it was" i said, my attention elsewhere as i examined the elementals
composition for any traces of marble.</p>

<p align=left>Lumil noted my detachment and sighed deeply, doubtlessly amazed by my prowess in both battle
and intellectual pursuits. Shaking his head, he went back to his books as i began to examine
the birds for any interesting feathers, hiding the bodies when i found nothing but coins, which
i split with the Mage. As lumil buried his nose in his studies, i took a light nap, and we set about
waiting for the next patrol.</p>


<p align=left>To be continued...</p>

<p align=left>Sincerely,<br> 
Jediit of the Order.</p>
