Stand your ground!”<p>	He turned and saw three soldiers marching toward him.

Thar’s no ale for the poor ol’ tillerman, is thar?  ‘Twas all a lie!”<p>	By now, the guardsmen had almost reached the ship.<p>	“Listen, ye little guppy,” said Santiago.  “Those men thar, they’re comin’ to kill us.  Ye know what I mean?  They won’t even bury us.  They’ll just throw us out into the sea, an’ we’ll be fish food.  I don’t want to be fish food, do ye?”<p>	Mr. Knife stared blankly for a moment.  “Why in the blazes do they want to kill us?”<p>	“Well, ye see, they think I killed some blokes…”<p>	The tillerman shook his head and glared at Santiago.  “Ye darn’d fool!  Can’t ye spend a single night in town without killin’ someone?”<p>	“I didn’t do it!”<p>	“Aye, that’s what ye always say.”  Mr. Knife stood up and faced the soldiers.  “Ahoy thar, ye lubbers!  Just so ye know, I ain’t with this bloke here.  He’s a villain, an’ a pirate, an’ a darn’d fool besides.  So if ye please, I’ll just be goin’ along me way, back to the tavern…”  He ducked back down as a crossbow bolt embedded itself in the main mast.<p>	“Well, it was worth a try,” the tillerman grinned sheepishly.<p>	“Aye, I’ll remember that.  Now raise the anchor, ye bloody mutineer, or we’ll both be swiss cheese!”<p>	While the drunken tillerman crawled his way to the anchor, Santiago unlocked one of the wooden chests on the deck.  “Me sacred chest o’ booze,” he murmured reverently.  He raised the lid and pulled out a bottle of purple liquid.<p>	“Last bottle o’ dragon breath ale,” he whispered.  “Shame to just throw it away like this, but it’s either that or the deep six.”  He lobbed the bottle over the side of the boat, and covered his ears.<p>A few seconds later, there was a tremendous explosion.  Peeking over the side of the boat, he saw the three soldiers lying on the docks, smoke rising up from their burnt armor.<p>“Hah!  That got ‘em!” cried Santiago.  “Did ye see that, matey?”  But Mr. Knife wasn’t paying attention.  Instead, he had crawled up to the booze chest, and was now in the process of emptying a bottle of Black Skull Rum.<p>“Oh no ye don’t, ye bloody drunk!  No more booze for you ‘til we get out onto the open sea!”<p>Mr. Knife only made an obscene gesture toward Santiago, and began whispering to the bottle.<p>“Now I remember why I never let ye leave the boat,” Santiago muttered.  “Next time we throw anchor, I’m gonna tie ye to it.  No, wait…better yet…”  His voice trailed off as he stared out into the bay.<p>There was another ship coming toward them.<p>“Thar’s another ship comin’ towards us!” cried Santiago.  “They’re flyin’ the flag o’ the Royal Navy!”<p>For some reason, Mr. Knife thought that was very funny, and began to roll around on the deck, giggling.  Santiago muttered a curse and began to bring the ship around.  There was no way they would be able to get around the other ship in time.  He looked around the deck in desperation.<p>“You, there, aboard the Peregrine!” came a voice from the other ship.  “Stand down, and prepare to be boarded!”<p>“Promise ye won’t harm us?” he shouted.<p>Even from this distance, he could hear laughter from the other ship.  “We promise.”  More laughter.<p>“Aye, all right.  We give up.”<p>He watched glumly as the other ship drew near.
