<p align=left><b>Dis Be How Oogle Tink Dat Solfy Go Ways</b><br><i>by Oogle</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>You want to know what happen to that Solf-brother? Well, it be long story, and oogle do oogle's
best to tell you how it happen.</p>

<p align=left>It all start long agos...long long long agos, when Oogle was just a little trolly.</p>

<p align=left>**flashback**</p>

<p align=left>It was a close, tense fight, but as always, Oogle was the victor. With blood and gore streaming
down his chest and face, he sat heavily down in the murky waters of Innothule swamp, struggling
to find the energy to implore the spirits to heal his many grievous wounds. Slowly, he felt the
spirits contact him, filling him with his juju, enabling Oogle to work his shamanistic majiks. As
patient as a troll can be, Oogle let the juju engulf him, till he felt a tingling in his very being.</p>

<p align=left>In a flash of soft blue light and a muted thunderclap, Oogle felt his wounds slowly close and the
scars burn away. Exhausted by the fight, he made a pillow of the dead kobolds blood-matted
fur and began to slip in the Dreamland. </p>

<p align=left>A time of spiritual renewal for a shaman, the Dreamland is True Dreaming...when the spirit opens
itself to those that have gone before and those that are to come. Some fancy mages have
tried to classify it and degrade it as a psychic imaging, or an out of body experience...but the
shamans no better.</p>

<p align=left>Thus it was that Oogle found himself in a grey, flat plane with ghostly, familiar shapes skirting
about him. Slowly, a tall (relatively so, as few beings are taller then a troll) shape drifted over
to him. </p>

<p align=left>"Oogle." the shape breathed softly, almost beneath hearing.</p>

<p align=left>"Howdy der, spirit. Yu kno Oogle's name, but whu yu be?" Oogle inquired politely</p>

<p align=left>"You would not have spent much time with me at the time you are in. In fact, if i recall correctly
and we spirits generally do, then you only met me once, when you asked me to do you a favor..."</p>

<p align=left>Oogle struggled to remember the event in question, for although it happened only a few days 
ago, it had slipped his mind until the spirit reminded him. Something about a spirit possessed
barbarian, a dangerous trek over a continent...a meeting with a tall enchanter...</p>

<p align=left>"Yu be Solfy!! Yu help Oogle git Oogle's nu armor! Oogle no forgit yu!" Oogle said cheerily, happy
to remember his friend and avoiding offending the spirit. But slowly, Oogle turned a pale green
as he recalled where he was. "Dat no gud! Yu enchantirs no be able tu com heers...dat meen
yu be..."</p>

<p align=left>"Dead, I suppose. Do not worry my large green brother, I died helping a good friend." Solf said.</p>

<p align=left>"Ohs. well, Oogle glad dat yu no be bittir spirit. Wat happin? iff'n yu no mynd tell'n Oogle."</p>

<p align=left>"Friend, you know i cannot tell you of future events...but just remember this,and i will leave you
to your sleep. When the time comes, return the favor..."</p>

<p align=left>As the Dreamland began to fade and Oogle slipped into a deeper level of sleep, Solflexion smiled
sadly as he knew that when the time came...the troll shaman would know what to do.</p>

<p align=left>**end flashback**</p>

<p align=left>Well, that only be the beginning of the story of how Solfy leave us. Oogle tell you what happen
much much later in Oogle's life. By the by, iff'n you have delicate ears...maybe you no want
to read this. Just know that Solfy be safe an happy where he be.</p>

<p align=left>Oh's? you still here? Oks then.</p>

<p align=left>**twenty years later following Oogle's encounter with Solf's spirit**</p>

<p align=left>"BURRRRRRR!!" Oogle said as his massive green formed shivered uncontrollably. "Wy yu want
Oogle com tu dis playc agins? De barbi's no lyk Oogle, De wether no lyk Oogle, and Oogle no
ly eider uv dem!"</p>

<p align=left>"Patience, Oogle." wearily leaning upon a staff imbrued with unknown magics, Solf slowly bent
down to examine an ice covered rock formation. "Rumor has it that a party of Dwarven miners,
in a treasure hunting expedition, found a strain of ice diamonds somewhere near the lair of Lady
Vox..."</p>

<p align=left>"wat be ice dymin?"</p>

<p align=left>Glancing at Oogle's bewildered look, Solf chuckled and said "Sometimes i forget that not all share my passion for gemstones and other pretty rocks. An ice diamond is unlike any other diamond.
It is completely flawless and is clearer then the purest water. Some people call them rainbow
crystals, due to the amazing array of effects and colors as light is diffracted through prizmatic
surfaces."</p>

<p align=left>"errrr. oks, iff'n yu says so. enyways, wat yu want dis dymin for? yu gots plenti uv uther dymins
tu mayk yer girly jewlry." Oogle slapped his meaty thigh as he laughed at his own joke.</p>

<p align=left>"Asides from the aesthetic value of such a flawless dymin...damn...diamond, they are rumored
to be able to enhance and focus the powers of the mind. Some say that the Orbs of Tashania
are made of God-blessed and shaped ice diamonds." </p>

<p align=left>A fierce icy wind, full of the promise of snow blew then, cutting through Solf's thick fur coats
and whipping about Oogle's large, unprotected ears. The locals had warned that only an idiot
or a troll would be stupid enough to blunder about the tundra at this time of year, to which
Solf could only reply "Yes."</p>

<p align=left>Trudging along in silence, Oogle with his massive hands covering his equally large ears in a rather
comic scene, Solf began to reconsider his reasonings for this trek. He had fallen into a dark
melancholy for the past couple of weeks, depressed at the repetiveness of his life. Get up,
make jewelry, drink some wine with Ralineth or another friend, go to bed. Although occasionally
broken up by a hectic adventure with his brothers and sisters, Solf had grown weary of his
life and jumped at the chance for a ill-planned, spontaneous trip with little to no chance of 
success. </p>

<p align=left>The wind began to howl about them, blowing up snow and obscuring their vision. As frigid 
air whipped about them, driving them this way and that, Solf began to think that they should
seek shelter. Oogle heartily agreed and they trudged off to where they had seen a small cave
out of the wind.</p>

<p align=left>It was only a short distance, but a dangerous one, as the wind blew them off course, leading
them in directions they had no intention of going. Still, they had been making good progress,
mainly because Solf was clinging to Oogle's large belt and letting the troll take the brunt of the
wind, when Oogle froze, deathly still.</p>

<p align=left>"Wu-wu-why are yu-yu-you stopppping?" Solf shouted in Oogle's ear.</p>

<p align=left>"No muuv...Oogle herd big grindin noyse, mebe wun dem larg ice gients" gazing about the 
landscape, Oogle thought he could see a massive shape moving through the snow. "EEEK!!! der
it be!"</p>

<p align=left>With a gasp of horror, Solflexion kept a tight hold upon Oogle's belt as the troll called upon the
Spirit of the Cheetah to make their escape. Suddenly, the true cause of the grinding noise 
revealed itself as the pair burst through ice weakened by Oogle's great weight.</p>

<p align=left>The shock of the frigid water hit Solf like a physical blow, nearly knocking him unconscious. It
was all he could do to keep a tight grip upon the troll's belt. While Solf wrestled with consciousness,
Oogle whisked off his confining mail armor to allow him more mobility. Years of experience in
first Innothule Swamp and then Lake Rathetear, coupled with Oogle's natural buoyancy, saved
them both, as with strong, confident strokes Oogle swum towards shore, stopping at the 
occasional air pocket.</p>

<p align=left>Gasping and reeling at one of those pockets, Solf sputtered "Oogle, i am not going to make it.
let me go so you can find a way out, i am just weighing you down"</p>

<p align=left>"No." to lend weight to his verbose arguement, Oogle dove back under, towards a darker spot
in the ice that looked as if it were thinner then the rest.</p>

<p align=left>Slamming mightily against the ice, Oogle beat at it furiously trying to break through. With black
spots swimming in his vision and the deadweight of Solf's grip getting looser, Oogle called upon
the spirits to aide him and brought for a magic he had not used since he was a little shamaner, 
long ago when a certain enchanter helped him get teh armor he had just dropped into the water.
With his final breath, Oogle sent a Burst of Flame into the ice, melting it and allowing him to 
burst through, dragging Solflexion into the underwater cave and blessed air.</p>

<p align=left>"Solf! we be sayf! Get yer wet cloths off!"</p>

<p align=left>Solflexion did not stir, so Oogle ripped off Solf's wet fur garments and begin rubbing the Erudite
furiously. </p>

<p align=left>"Solf no die. Solf no die. Solf no die. Solf no die. Solf no die...Pleez Solf."</p>

<p align=left>Slowly, like a whale surfacing from the depths of the ocean, light, feeble and wan, entered Solf's
eyes. Coughing miserably, Solf sagged in Oogles rough embrace.</p>

<p align=left>For days and days the blizzard raged. For days and days Solf's fever raged, fighting off sickness
and death feebly. Oogle found some old bones and wood in recessed corner and lit a fire, placing
the sickened Solf as near as possible, almost burning his nose. When Solf's clothes finally dryed
Oogle piled them atop the weak enchanter.</p>

<p align=left>Still, it was not enough. Despite Oogle's efforts and the spirits liberal granting of juju, Solf felt
himself slipping closer and closer to a blackness so deep that it frightened him. But his fear 
could not overcome his weariness...the real sickness was not in his body, but in his soul.</p>

<p align=left>"Oogle, i am going to die."</p>v

<p align=left>"no say dat! yu be fyn. we jest hav tu wayt until de storm go aways, den we be able tu leev.
Oogle tell yu dat Oogle fynd uther entrenc? it blockd wit snow, but snow melt somtyms." Oogle
tried to keep a happy, cheerful face about him, but the spirits told Oogle of Solf's real problem,
and Oogle wracked his mind fruitlessly for a solution.</p>

<p align=left>Closer and closer to oblivion Solf drifted, and Oogle's massive frame began to shrink as his body
began to live off his own fat in the absence of food. Soon Oogle too became sick from the 
combination of the great, starving pain of his hunger, and the great, stabbing pain of his worry
for his friend.</p>

<p align=left>It was a week after they had fallen in, and with Solf barely alive, that the spirits told Oogle
what to do. A sad solution, but necessary. Oogle began to gather old bones and strange 
looking rocks and placing them about Solf's nearly still form.</p>

<p align=left>When all was ready, Oogle sat down next to Solf and explained his plan, to which Solf wearily
agreed. </p>

<p align=left>Patiently, Oogle waited and waited. Although only an hour passed, it seemed like years until 
Solf shuddered silently,and with a sad glance at Oogle, slipped away.</p>

<p align=left>Bursting into action, Oogle took a large rock and hit himself, knocking himself unconscious and
into the Dreamland. His spiritual form staggering, Oogle sighted the fading spirit of his fallen
friend. With a mighty roar that shook the Dreamland, disturbing many of those who had dwelt
so long in peace and harmony, Oogle grasped Solf's spirit tightily and flew, gaining speed and 
momentum as their spirits passed through land after land, oogle frantically searching for something.</p>

<p align=left>"THER!" Oogle thought. Finally he had found what his friend needed. On a far away plane, 
so distant that Oogle had never even heard of its existence, a baby was stillborn. Despairing,
the parents cried and moaned. With his last energy, Oogle flung Solf's spirit down down down
until it burst into the baby's previously lifeless body, and giving an ear shattering scream as it
took its first breath in a new world.</p>

<p align=left>While the disbelieving parents, tears of joy streaming down their faces, heard only a newborns
cry of life, Oogle heard something far different.</p>

<p align=left>within that first cry, as Oogle slowly regained consciousness and his spirit fled back to his own body, Oogle heard "Thank you my friend, I told you that you would know what to do when the
time comes."</p>

<p align=left>**back to the present, the Rhinelander's cottage in Everfrost where Oogle is explaining to 
Azlana and Waran what happened to their brother Solflexion**</p>

<p align=left>"Dat be de tale uv wat happin tu Solfy. Oogle no kno wer he be, but he be wit lovin family...
just lyk we wer tu him. Oogle jest wish dat we coulda ben wit Solfy mor..mebe no git soulsick."</p>

<p align=left>With large wet tears streaming down everyone's faces, the Rhinelanders lift their mugs in a 
toast.</p>

<p align=left>"To Solflexion!"</p>
<p align=left>"To New Life!"</p>
