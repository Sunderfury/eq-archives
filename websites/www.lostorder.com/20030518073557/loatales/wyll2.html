<p align=left><b>Journal - Day Two</b><br><i>by Wyll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>After a very restless night in the inn, I awoke groggily to find Wysll standing over me. Nothing against Wysll, but his face is not one I would voluntarily wake up to. Anyway, my brothers met up in my room...it seems most of us had a restless night of bizarre dreams.</p>

<p align=left>Leaving the inn, we made for all the areas where wise ones are known to hold council. We first visited the cleric guild and then the enchanter guild. I get the impression these high elves don't bother looking down very often for none of them bothered to respond to us. At least until we got to the wizard guild....and then perhaps I would have wished we didn't get a response.</p>

<p align=left>A rather foul lady named Naddia answered our calls for help, sort of. Through her constant insults she said she could help us if we returned with three sets of undead pawn bown chips. This task wasn't very difficult, those undead aren't any match for the Walaryn clan.</p>

<p align=left>Returning to Naddia with the bone chips wasn't any more pleasant the second time around. I wonder if she had a difficult childhood.... Well no matter. She grabbed the phrophecy from me and tried to divine its meaning. She said she couldn't understand what it was trying to say either so she decided to so some kind of casting on it. Then things got strange (as if they weren't already). She slipped into a trance similar to the one I did. When this happened the parchment the prophecy was on slipped out of her hands. I quickly snatched it up and scribbled down what she spoke. I've copied it into my journal below:</p>

<p align=left>Wind blown and battered the Balanced One finds Light<br>
Truth pierces the gloom, Love destroys the Shadows<br>
And with clarity in heart and soul she weds the champion<br>
Who banished the Whirlwind from her life</p>

<p align=left>After many seasons of peace and happiness<br>
The West wind builds once again<br>
Through capture and deception the Dark deed is done<br>
The mother's blood runs true and pure in a bed of sorrow</p>

<p align=left>A gust from the West carries the cry of a newborn babe<br>
From the East blows a wind to counter the other<br>
Seasons pass and the Whirlwinds forms anew<br>
The Dark and Light choose a new balance around which to dance</p>

<p align=left>Once again, none of this means much to any of us, but I think we are beginning to see some key points. When Naddia recovered she was furious with us. She began shouting about how thoughtless it was for us to bring her something so dangerous. I don't know what she was talking about, it was only a piece of parchment with some words on it...but she seemed to think differently. And then she said something very curious...she mentioned our father. She said that he used to reside in Felwithe, but had since left. She said she never really knew what he was working on, but that it probably had something to do with this. I don't know what to make of that, we always thought our father dead, as uncle Wyndsor had said. She then told us when he left Felwithe he said he was heading across the Ocean of Tears. </p>

<p align=left>With that news, my brothers and I immediately left (or were kicked out by Naddia) and headed toward the docks in Butcherblock. The boat was departing just as we arrived so we decided to get a room for the night and make the vile boat ride over to Antonica tomorrow.</p>

<p align=left>What can I say, things are getting more bizarre by the day.</p>
