<p align=left><b>Enter The Apprentice, Part Two</b><br><i>by anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The next morning Tanzenier went to the bedchamber of his young yet adept pupil, and knocked on the door to call him to breakfast. There was no answer to his knock. </p>


<p align=left>"Your breakfast is getting cold boy, and whether you've eaten or not today's lessons will begin soon." Tanzenier pressed his ear to the door and heard nothing. "Boy?" he called again. Tanzenier would not have this kind of laziness, especially on a day when new lessons were to begin. He opened the door and saw his student still curled up in bed, the covers pulled up tight, and sleeping on his side with his back to the door! This last point truly angered Tanzenier for such vulnerability was inexcusable, even for one so young as this student. "Boy, I have told about this too many times. Today you will learn why." Tanzenier said under his breath as he pulled a small knife from his belt and crept toward the sleeping boy. </p>


<p align=left>Just as Tanzenier had reached the edge of the boy's bed, he suddenly felt the unmistakable pinprick of a dagger being pressed to his back. He stopped cold for a moment and his mind raced with questions- 'How could someone have snuck up on him? How could someone have broken in without him knowing? How could… </p>


<p align=left>"Gotcha master…"said the recognizably young voice, with no small amount of self-pride. </p>


<p align=left>When Tanzenier realized what had happened, he simply shook his head in disbelief. He couldn't believe that this young boy had just outwitted and out 'stealthed' him. He turned slowly and looked down at the boy…the boy who stood there staring back up with the biggest grin a boy of twelve could muster. </p>


<p align=left>"Pretty good eh? I fooled you and then snuck up behind you without you hearing me." The boy could hardly contain himself. </p>


<p align=left>"Yes, boy, you did very well," Tanzenier said smiling. "Now go eat your breakfast so we can start your lessons." </p>


<p align=left>The boy sheathed his dagger and briefly struck a very self-assured pose with as great an air of self-satisfaction a boy of twelve might have before running off to his awaiting breakfast. Tanzenier watched the boy scamper off, and mused to himself. </p>


<p align=left>"Have I really gotten old enough and slow enough to have been so easily duped by the boy?" his face grew long for a moment. "Ahh troll dung!! Like hell I have. That boy is just plain good. No two ways about it." Tanzenier then headed for the kitchen to join his pupil. He didn't know whether to be more pleased with himself for teaching the boy so well, or with the boy for learning so well. In the end he figured it didn't really matter. So long as the boy knew what he needed to and knew how to implement his knowledge. Tanzenier stopped in the doorway of the kitchen and just watched the boy for a few moments. He had never felt so strongly about any of the others he had taught, but then, he had never had so young a student before. He felt his eyes start to well up, and immediately halted this line of thought, for it would not do to have the boy see him so. </p>


<p align=left>"What will we start with today Master?" asked the boy before stuffing his mouth with more of his breakfast. </p>


<p align=left>"Well, you have actually already started." replied Tanzenier calmly. </p>


<p align=left>"What do you mean? You said I was going to learn of poisons today." As the boy continued chewing, Tanzenier just stood and stared, rather coldly, at the boy. The boy had seen this look before. It meant that he was already being tested, that if he did not come to a quick realization about what was or what was about to happen, he would be in trouble if not dead. He stopped chewing and looked down at his mostly empty plate. He spat out what was left in his mouth onto the plate and shot up out of his chair, knocking it over. "You have poisoned me Master haven't you?" He stared at his teacher with no small amount of panic and a touch of anger plainly displayed in his expression, his little chest moving so quickly with panicked breathing. </p>


<p align=left>Tanzenier moved to the panicked boy and gently clasped the boy's shoulders. He knew that each moment felt like a terrible eternity to the boy. He looked down and confirmed the boy's fear with a simple "Yes, I have." tears started to well in the boy's eyes. "Now, now none of that. Remember, fear and emotion only cloud the path to solution. You need not fear. T'was a very mild poison I used. It will do little more than turn your stomach for a little bit. This was to teach you that you must be able to discover poisons as well as produce and apply them. What you have ingested this morning was a diluted bit of spider's poison, and will help you to build a tolerance for it. I have administered dozens of poisons, of different types, effects and strengths to myself. All to the ends of building an immunity. However, doing this is a most dangerous thing and takes many years to achieve the level of tolerance that I have." </p>


<p align=left>The boy had calmed down somewhat and Tanzenier surprised himself by giving the boy a hug. He didn't quite understand why, but it was an urge he could not resist. Even the boy was surprised, but he didn't give up the chance to feel a bit more like a normal boy getting a hug from someone that cared about him. </p>


<p align=left>Tanzenier broke the moment and began going on about the rest of day's lesson. "Come boy, to the laboratory with us, so I may teach you of the basic principles of the different poisons and their respective effects." Tanzenier left the kitchen and headed down the hall. The boy lingered in the kitchen for a moment and thought about how nice the hug had felt. He then recalled how his master had told him never to allow emotions be a distraction from the task at hand. He left the kitchen and the thoughts of warm compassion behind. </p>


<p align=left>Throughout that day and over the next several weeks, Tanzenier taught his apt student of the many fine points of creating poisons and the various methods for applying them so as to have the greatest effect on a subject. The boy, as with most everything else, learned this deadly art quickly. He all but mastered the techniques for poisoning a blade, with of course the occasional near fatal mishap. In time, the boy was able to administer poison in almost any manner or fashion imaginable, and do so with such subtlety as to be nigh perceptible, excepting only to the most trained in such things. The lad, now reaching his early teens, had, for the most part, always displayed a great deal of patience for heeding his teacher's pace of training. However, there would inevitably come a time when the lad's patience would give way to the desire to apply what he had learned. Most often, this break meant Tanzenier would become the unwitting subject of his pupil's testing of a newly mastered skill. Tanzenier did not really mind. After all, what better way for the lad to test himself without getting in over his head? Tanzenier also knew that when the boy was able to significantly challenge or even best his master, the pride the boy felt was immeasurable. When such happened, Tanzenier too was greatly filled with pride. One could almost say that Tanzenier had grown fond of the lad's little poses and silent expressions of self-satisfaction. The more Tanzenier thought of this the more concerned had became. He began to wonder if he were getting soft and sentimental. Such things were not good for one in Tanzenier's trade. </p>


<p align=left>"Tanz, old boy, you're getting too attached to that boy." Deep in thought, Tanzenier sat in his chair next to the warming glow of the fireplace. "I know…I know." he sighed, "But what's not to like in that lad? He's the best student I ever had. None of the others were nearly as dedicated, and they were all older when they started." He closed his eyes and thought more deeply on the matter. Finally, he opened his eyes again and breathed a heavy sigh. One of those sighs that comes with enlightened realization of the truth. "No, it is more than the boy's skill and ability that you are fond of old man. It is the boy himself. What to do? He is not quite ready to go on his own, but I cannot hide my…" he closed his eyes again, "love for the lad forever. However, if I let him see, if I let him know, I will undo all that he has learned of the frivolity," he chuckled to himself lightly at the irony, "of emotions and sentimentality." Tanzenier took another sip of his wine, and just sat and listened to the quiet noises outside, to his own breathing and heart beat, to a heart beat not his own… someone else was in the room. He set his goblet on the small table next to him and waited. </p>


<p align=left>There is the briefest of moments when, if one is focused enough, one can hear the air move - almost in anticipation of action before there is actually movement. It is this moment that decides whether men live or die. Tanzenier certainly wasn't ready to depart this world for good just yet, so when that moment came he brought both his hands up to guard his throat and caught the garroting cord that appeared before him. Tanzenier jerked the cord forward, causing his would-be strangler to slam into the back of the chair and stumble to the floor. Tanzenier leapt up and spun to face the attacker, whose identity he already knew. Tanzenier righted his slightly rumpled shirt and leisurely walked back to the small table to retrieve his wine goblet. "Are you finished with your playing this evening?" </p>


<p align=left>Though the lad could not yet see his master's face, he could hear the smile in his voice. He got up from the floor and leaned on the back of the chair to talk to his master this time, rather than try to strangle him. "Yes, I'm done. I'm sorry. I was just bored. I did use the practice cord and not the wire. So it wasn't as if I were truly making an attempt on your life." </p>


<p align=left>"Yes, I noticed. The only thing you should really be sorry about is the racket you made trying to sneak in here." Tanzenier's tone dripped lightly with sarcasm as he smiled and took another sip of wine. </p>


<p align=left>"Racket? I didn't make one sound. Anyway, like I said I was just bored and looking for something to do. I was wondering… can I go out?" The poor lad sound like someone with a mild case of cabin fever. </p>


<p align=left>Tanzenier arched an eyebrow. " Go out? Where?" As he spoke he heard how much his words sounded like a father questioning his son. </p>


<p align=left>"Well," the lad moved around the to the front of the chair and sat down. "I was thinking, here I am someone who has learned all these things, why not go out and kill someone?" he looked up at his teacher with an expression that said, 'that's logical isn't it?'. </p>


<p align=left>Tanzenier did not like the way this conversation was going. He set down his goblet again. "Why do you want to kill someone? Do you know who you want to kill?" Tanzenier feared that this day would come. He waited for the answer he already knew. </p>


<p align=left>The boy stood up, picking at one of his fingernails. He shrugged and said, "I don't know. Someone… anyone. It doesn't really matter who or why, does it?" He could never have known how much that was the wrong answer. Tanzenier didn't even wait for the boy to finish his last word before bringing the back of his closed fist into shattering contact with the side of the boy's face. The boy sprawled on the floor holding his face and staring up at an enraged animal he had never seen before. </p>

<p align=left>"Let that serve to remind you boy! Never kill without purpose!!" Tanzenier's face was red as a smith's forge and just as hot. "Killing without purpose is an empty and unrewarding thing." The livid master stood over the boy pointing his finger down in a manner of one accusing another of an unforgivable crime. "Killing without purpose is beneath people like us! It is a waste of time skill, and ability. All of which are such commodities that should never be wasted. Something must always be gained. Preferably a profit of some kind, but there must always be a reason for you to take another person's life." Tanzenier had calmed down now. Most of it was for show anyway, to impress upon the boy the seriousness of the matter. He knelt down and helped the boy up. "Do you understand why it is so important to always have purpose with regard to what we do?" He could tell by his pupil's expression that the true gravity of this eluded the boy. "You see, purpose is what defines the ever so delicate and narrow line between a murderer and a professional killer. Yes, if caught, you will suffer the same fate. However, there are more options open to professionals." The boy looked as if he were finally beginning to understand but wasn't quite there yet. "Let me put it this way… you never know who may come to your aid when you need it. You will learn that support can often come from the most unlikely of places." This concept, the boy easily grasped. </p>


<p align=left>"I understand Master. I am sorry." The boy bowed his head, letting his chin rest on his chest. "I promise to always be purposeful in my dealings." </p>


<p align=left>"You will honor me and what I have taught you by making this promise to me. However, you must honor yourself by making that same promise to yourself. If you should forget this promise, far worse than dishonoring me, you will lose your focus. The farther you stray on the path of unfocused thought and planning, the more you become a common rogue and cutthroat. Always remember, you are better than that. Not only because of what I have taught you, but more so because of what you have within you." Tanzenier could feel those soft thoughts of compassion creeping into the hallways of his mind and heart. "Now, if you still want to go out, go into the forest and kill a stag, we are in need of meat. That should provide you enough challenge for tonight." He regarded the boy for a moment and then quickly turned away with feigned purpose, for he could feel an itch at his eye that meant a tear was sure to come. "Go… go hunt boy. You need the exercise if you've any intention of sleeping well tonight." The boy lingered for a moment and made motion to speak but decided against it and instead left to prepare for his evening hunt. After he was sure that the boy had gone, Tanzenier leaned against the hearth and sighed heavily. "A few more lessons and he will be ready to leave." The pensive teacher closed his eyes and folded his arms over his chest. "If I did not think that it would betray everything I have taught him about survival, I would keep him here as long as he wished to stay." Tanzenier returned to his chair and his goblet of wine.</p>
