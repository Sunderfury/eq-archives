<p align=left><b>And So It Goes...</b><br><i>by Cyrssi</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Dear Elandel,</p>

<p align=left>It is hard to go on without you, but I know that it is what you would want me to do. I am going to be keeping this journal from this day forth until we shall see each other again. Each entry will be addressed to you, so that you may know what I have been doing in the event that I do not hand this book to you myself.</p>

<p align=left>When I awoke and found you missing, I was terribly disturbed. I took the ship back to Faydwer and went to our hometown of Kelethin in order to find some peace. Once I had found that peace, I returned to Antonica determined to do what we had been doing all along...striving to earn the right to carry the name Treeskin.</p>

<p align=left>At first I tried to go back to the desert and oasis, but I couldn't stay there long because memories began to cloud my spirits and I knew that survival depended on my clearheadedness and quick thinking. I instead travelled to the West Commonlands. After seeing only a few bears worthy of my skills, I happened upon a Dervish Cutthroat encampment. They did not attack me when I approached, but they did not seem to be too thrilled that I was there. I asked a passing monk by the name of Fengtui if he wanted to do something about the Dervs, and he agreed to help me.</p>

<p align=left>We proceeded to rid the West Commonlands of many a Dervish; mainly the thugs and the mages of the group. We would also engage passing wisps. When the whole fight ended it was pretty late. All the monk asked for was a large bag, 3 of the many rings we had collected, and a third of the money we had collected. I was amazed, but he explained that he had little use for money, although what I gave him would feed him for many a day. He was a nice and fun person to fight alongside. I hope that if you see him you show him the kindness he showed me.</p>

<p align=left>Shortly after we parted ways, I realized that I was extremely exhausted. I walked over to the druid ruins and set up camp here. I feel safe among fellow druids. I am now about to fall asleep writing this, so I will bring this to a close. I shall write again tomorrow night before I sleep.</p>

<p align=left>Goodnight, brother.</p>
