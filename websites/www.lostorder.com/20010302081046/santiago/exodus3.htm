<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">Leaving
Britain was like walking outside after a long imprisonment in a dark dungeon. Gone were
the noisy crowds, the greedy thieves and the foul-mouthed cretins who fill the air with
their ugly words. Out here in the forest, there was fresh air and blissful silence.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">For the first time in
years, Sarangoulis had nowhere to be. No missions, no objectives, no agendas. There was no
kingdom that needed to be saved &#150; or if there was, it wasn&#146;t his responsibility
to save it. The constant burden of necessity had been removed, and he felt as though he
was a young man again.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He wandered down the
old forest path, savoring every sight, sound and smell. It was early spring, and the world
was beginning to awaken once again. Newborn flowers smiled up at him, their soft, fragile
petals still coated with morning dew. He stopped and watched as a sparrow flew through the
air with a seemingly effortless grace. To Sarangoulis, there was more magic in its flight
than there was in all the tomes of all the mages in the world.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">And yet, as he
watched, he felt a twinge of regret. Until yesterday, he had had the power to transform
and grow wings of his own. But he had never seen a use for that spell; it had slept
dormant in his spellbook for years. And now that he wished to use it, it was gone. He
could only stand and watch as the simple creature glided freely into the distance.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He walked along the
path for a long time, past all of the old farmhouses and cottages where the peasants were
going about their daily chores. A few of them paused and waved to him as he passed by.
Their ancestors had worked the land for centuries, providing food to eat for the people of
the Realm. Such a vital role, and yet they were simple people, leading simple lives. At
the end of the day they slept soundly, comforted by the warmth of family and the
satisfaction that only honest labor can bring. Sarangoulis envied them that comfort, yet
knew that he would never share it. Not for him a life of peace and happiness. His would be
a darker path, fraught with peril and misery &#150; a path chosen freely, but not without
regret.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">When he came to the
crossroads, he chose the northern path. He had decided to travel up to Yew to spend some
time at Empath Abbey, the home of one of his oldest friends, friar Santos. It had been a
long time since he had undertaken such a journey. In the past, he had relied upon his
spells to teleport him instantly from place to place. It had been necessary; the wizards
of the Circle could not afford to waste time when there was a threat to the Realm. By
using those spells, though, he had lost touch with the natural world. Jumping from city to
city, he had never known the simple pleasure of walking through the countryside on a warm,
sunny afternoon.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">At the arrival of
dusk, Sarangoulis decided to set camp near the road. It took him ten minutes to build a
small campfire, when a single spell would have done it in seconds. He glanced around the
dark woods and shivered. There were dangerous creatures out there in the shadows, and he
no longer had his magic to defend him. Gone forever was the mighty archmage. Now, he was
nothing more than a man, alone in the darkening forest with only a dagger to defend
himself.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">So it was that his
heart nearly stopped when he looked up and saw a shadowy figure standing near the fire.</font></font></p>
