        <font color="midnightblue" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2"> <font face='Comic Sans MS'>A real story about nothing in particular other than growing up clueless.</font id='Comic Sans MS'></P><P>In my youth, my brother-in-law and I would play basketball at my elementary school in the summer evenings and weekend afternoons.  The school was 5 minutes drive from my house and was a convenient place to play and we had a regular crowd for, at worst, 4 on 4 but usually 5’s running full court.</P><P>The court itself was uneven asphalt (showcased any time it rained by the numerous puddles as well as the number of sprained ankles) with 12’ of chain link fence.  The fence itself wasn’t to keep anyone out (for anyone reading who lives or grew up in Jersey), it was to keep the kids from running into the road to stare down traffic.  The goals were made of what had to be cast iron mounted on two poles (two!) with metal rims and the obligatory playground chain-link nets.  There were two basketball courts at the time, one with an 8’ rim that was never used by the crowd.  The main court measured out at 9’10” and 10’1” and I think it was the first time in my life I realized that elementary schools really are far from perfect.  Or maybe it wasn’t and I realized that when the principal was led away in a straightjacket (true story).</P><P>One particular summer Saturday afternoon, the crowd was gathering at the court to play but this time, there was something different.  There was a stranger on our court.  And somehow he got to the school without a car.  Now, this wasn’t that big a deal because you really can’t know everyone that hoops in The County, but we had a pretty good handle on our end of it.  Nevertheless, when you come up one short, you will pick up anyone to have even numbers (anything beats sitting) so we picked up our stranger to give us 5’s.  5’s, by the way, is our old-school hoopspeak for having a 5 on 5 game; when there are 5 players on a team.  If you don’t know basketball, this is how its normally played.</P><P>One thing that never caught on in our little redneck corner of the world was the use of nicknames.  We were simply Timmy or Frank or Keith. The only one with even a semblance of a nickname was mine when I was first playing with the 20 and 30 year olds who taught me how to play.  My nickname was “Damnit.”</P><P>“Damnit don’t shoot that shot.”<BR>“Damnit pass me the ball when I’m open.”<BR>“Damnit damnit damnit.”</P><P>Ah youth is forever wasted on the young.  If only I was 14 again and knew then what I know now….or if I just felt 14 again, maybe that would be close enough.  But I digress….</P><P>So, the first time that I encountered a nickname heavy hoop area was on a visit to Raleigh to visit this same brother-in-law after he moved there (I was 16 at the time).  Me and Timmy, a friend who was gifted with better fast-twitch muscles than most Olympic athletes (but saddles with the ugliest jump shot in history, even though he never misses) went down to visit and play hoops.  It was our first “mini world tour” and the end it was very mini because our world then was very small.  We forayed to the Cary municipal park courts (as I recall, its been some time), large monuments of concrete and giant particle board backboards.  I swear you didn’t have to leave your feet if you wanted to smack the board and your angle of attack on lay-ups and dunks (more on this much later) was key to success.  It was on this Raleigh court that we met Kool-Aid.  He wouldn’t give any other name, he was Kool-Aid because he was so sweet.  I guess it’s a good thing he didn’t nickname himself Fructose, because that wouldn’t have been nearly as cool as naming yourself after a sugarless packet of flavoring.  There were other nicknames on that court that day, but only the three of us, sore thumbs, had real names to give.  Maybe we were really in some park for people in the Witness Protection Program and I missed the sign.  No matter, we were nicknameless and uncool, but at least we could shoot.  (Poor Kool-Aid had a complete infatuation with smacking the backboard after releasing a lay-up.  I swear to this day he missed 15 in a row, but he got good wood on every attempt.)</P><P>We were having fun running with “the new guy” (as close as we ever got to a nickname was “Hey” or “the new guy” until we learned your name) when his ride came to pick him up.  I can only describe the car as a real, honest-to-God, Sir Mixx-A-Lot brand hooptie.  A 1971-ish Corvelle that was equal parts blue, rust and Bondo and running like a poorly-oiled machine spewing a mixture of black and white smoke and sporting tires so bald they made Kojak look like an ape.  The lady driving pulled the car up near the court (into the foreboding and never-used Gravel Driveway To Nowhere) and yelled for our friend to get in the car.  She used his real name, but I don’t think we ever understood what in the devil she said anyway.  Our new friend, “Hey” offered a weak “sorry fellas” over his shoulder as he ran to join the lovely slice of womanhood and the 6 kids in the car on his way to either hell or home (or maybe they were the same thing).</P><P>As the car backed out “Hey” was halfway in the door (doing his best “Shaft Meets The Dukes of Hazzard” impression) when he stood up and exclaimed:</P><P>“If you ever get my way, just tell them you know Otay from the ‘Noke.”</P><P>With that pronouncement “Otay” shimmied into the car and was gone and was never heard from again.</P><P>We spent the next 20 minutes in utter disbelief over his departure.  Fifteen minutes trying to understand just what the heck “Otay from the ‘Noke” meant.  We finally decided that Otay was obviously a nickname (and probably self given at that, I mean, what kind of nickname is Otay?) and that ‘Noke was short for Roanoke (Capital Redneck City of the South, and that’s saying something).  </P><P>Some days I miss Otay and I wonder just what part of the ‘Noke he was from.  Okay, not really, but Ive never forgiven him for making me waste brain cells remembering his stupid nickname either.  And that goes for you, too, Kool-Aid.</P><P>Oh, the other five minutes of our delay was figuring out just who was gonna drop from our game to make it even again.</P><P>“Damnit, you get next, now sit down.”</P><P><BR>Edited by - Gwippen on 01/27/2002  22:53:06</font></td>
