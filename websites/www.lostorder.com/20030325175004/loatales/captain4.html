<blockquote>
<p align=left>Captain's Log: Snowreap 23, 10 P.Y.</p>

<p align=left>Bah its been rainin' like mad fer days now, though I can't complain since
I've been hole up here in the Royal Firkin. The ale here's a little sweeter
than what I found in Glenden Wood. Not bad, but some day soon I'm going to
have to head back north fer some of their nice bitter stout.</p>

<p align=left>Rumor has it that the Dereth remnant of the Order traveled south, and has
somewhat split up (I assume since they could do more damage that way).
Mayhaps tonight I shall attempt those foul lookin' portals and see if I can
head them off at Shoushi to the south. Though if the town to town portals
are anything like where yer spirit goes when its been beaten from yer body,
I'm probably going to return me ale, unused, to nature.</p>

<p align=left>Captain's Log: Snowreap 24, 10 P.Y.</p>

<p align=left>Back in Shoushi, the sun has already set on this day, but what a day its
been! I suppose I should start at the beginin' eh? Early this mornin' I
found meself starin' though the rain at that glowin' purple rip in reality.
The wench at the Royal Firkin said it was the Shoushi portal. I was
wonderin' if I should trust her considerin' how I stiffed her on me tab and
all, but then again with how she was a hollerin' and the look of the towne
guards as they were lookin' fer me gave me the confidence to jump through.</p>

<p align=left>I was right, I did end up returnin' me ale to its maker. Years on the sea
and I've never once lost me stomach, one trip through that portal though,
blimy! Still it got me as far as shoushi which was good enough. Headed
into town and started lookin' round the place. Very interesting city I must
say. I've never seen its like in all my travels through Sosaria. It has a
kinda flair. Still I wouldn't want to life 'ere, I'd miss home too much.
Rithwic was at least familiar enough to avoid that.</p>

<p align=left>Still the locals were quite friendly and polite and all. They told me that
there was a grouop of men and women headin' fer Hebian-To to the south-east
that might be the Lost Order. With that information and a little sake (I
could right a whole book on the joys of liquor in this place blimy!) in me
gullet I took off fer Hebian-To. The road here was a short one, only took
me part of the mornin' to get the Hebian-To. Not much in the way of beastie
on the way either, which as good fer me.</p>

<p align=left>Now this is where things start gettin' really interesting. I managed to
find me way in to Hebian-To with little problem, and would ye know who I
found takin' a nap in the town square? Me ole mess mate Joxer the Mighty!
With him was a young lass named Dora who looked like she should mop the deck
with both of our sorry carcases. Still it was good to see some familar
faces in the crowed.</p>

<p align=left>Joxer,Dora and I got to talkin' and were just about set on headin' out fer
some adventurin' when Tasslehof 'appened by. I'd have never known it, but
he's been 'unting me down fer quite some time. Mayhaps if I'd just sat
still I'd have caught up with the Lost quicker. Ah well, all's well that
ends in the tavern, right? Still good ole Tass is headin' up the Dereth
Faction. Guess the High Council decided to stick it out and bring the light
to Dereth since a goodly number of us were here already. That suites me
just fine though.</p>

<p align=left>Tasslehof had a few presents fer me though. He presented me with a
wonderful Oak Yumi, which is somethin' like the Yew bow's I used to make in
Sosaria, only of a much higher quality. I'm sure it's goin' to serve me
well fer many a year. Mayhaps if I ever truely retire from the adventurer's
life I can hang it over me mantel in Glenden Wood. (as if that'll ever
happen). Also Tasslehof and Dora presented me with two trade notes worth
almost two thousand Pyreals. T'was a great day in me opinion. With the new
found coin, and yumi, I headed off to proporly equip meself fer some
adventurin'</p>

<p align=left>Joxer and I decied to head back to Shoushi, to purchace me some studded
leather armor, since the armorer there was rumored to have a pretty
daughter,.. er I mean high quality goods. Also rumor had it that there was
an old dungeon over run with druges and their ilk. I don't know about you,
but I 'ate them cat like things almost as much as I hate water golems.</p>

<p align=left>Once we got me some decent armor, Joxer and I headed fer the Shoushi Grotto.
Along the way Joxer showed me how to use the magiks of the portals to
provide communications across the realm to others of the Lost Order. The
entrance to the Grotto was another of those damned portals. Fortuantly this
was a short trip and I didn't get too woozy. Once down in the Grotto we
made turned those cat like Drudges into cat skin rugs fer the dungeon.
Those crazy things were everywhere though.</p>

<p align=left>We were doing well until this foul oder started to creep up from the depths
of the dungeon. The air was thick with the rank oder and Joxer and I had to
run fer the exit. I know I blacked out at least once or twice trying to
crawl to the portal out. I managed to make it out in one peice, but Joxer
wasn't so lucky. He made it out, but needed to rest a while afore he could
go any further.</p>

<p align=left>While we rested, Kileyan (Grimm) found 'is way to Shoushi. The three of use
once again decended into the grotto dungeon and did battle with the druges
and shreths there in. After a short while that oder started it creepin' its
way back into me head, makin' the world seem slow and strange. We managed
to escape this time without much trouble.</p>

<p align=left>Once back on the surface we headed to Shoushi again, where we found Kelsam,
Necro and Arathor waiting fer us. With our new found fellowship we decied
to head to some hunting grounds in Hebian-To. I tell ye, it was truely
wonderful to see some of me old mates again. Been way too much water under
the keel since I last hunted with the likes!</p>

<p align=left>Our joyous reunion was short lived however, as the same stench that had our
head realing in the Shoushi grotto started to polute the air of this fine
city. T'was almost too much to bear! I made a run fer the outskirts of
town but couldn't make it before i blacked out.</p>

<p align=left>When I came too, I was not far to the east of the city. Near by the others
were gettin' their legs back under them. I guess i wasn't the only one to
pass out from the stench in the air. Still out of towne the air seemed
clearer so we opted to head south to Hebian-To and hunt along the beachs
there.</p>

<p align=left>Along the way to Hebian-To we happened across Tasslehof. We were runnin' so
fast, we almost missed him. He joined our fellowship and we continued along
to Hebian-To. In Hebian-To we collected Dora, and set about huntin' the
shores of the ocean. It was so good to smell the salty air again, to feel
the sting of the salty water and feel alive again, well alive until the
shallows sharkes came along that is.</p>

<p align=left>We headed east and south along the beach, killing serveral asure grommies, a
water golem and a few blue wasps. Things were going great until we that
water golem decied to pop up under me feet and splater be brains out onto
the sand. Fortuately fer me (and Kileyan) the nearest life stone was only
about a half mile away. Made fer a quick trip back to the rest of the
group. Unfortunatly fer me, the water golem hit me so hard that I couldn't
get me sences floating 'round in portal space. I'm not quite sure how long
it took me to get me sences and get back to the physical realm, but it was
long enough fer the rest of the party to deal with me corpse and several
more grommies.</p>

<p align=left>All in all, I think I spent almost as much time gatherin' me wits near the
life stone, than killing beaties, but it was some of the most fun I've had
huntin' with me maties in a long time. Fer now I'm going to rest a wee bit
here in Hebian-To, then perhaps I shall travel north again to Rithwic, or
perhaps even Glenden Wood.</p>
