<p align=left><b>Dark Britannia</b><br><i>by Ravindranath</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I must be getting old. The word is so simple, just three little letters staring up at me from this parchment. And yet, how can I describe the horror they impart to me? Old. Drawing nearer and nearer to the end. I can contemptuously curse my inevitable descent; I can shake my fist in defiance of fate. But to what end? I know it will triumph, no matter what I do. Old. You cannot see my hand, how it trembles slightly, how the flesh has been drawn thin and tight over fragile bones. You cannot see my face, ruined now with a hundred wrinkles. You cannot see what time has done to me; you can only see these words.</p>

<p align=left>Yes, I know…you are wondering what this old fossil is blabbering about this time. Well, I'll tell you. One of the benefits of age – perhaps the only one – is the ability to look at the past and the present, and to see the world for what it is. So if you have a moment – and I daresay you have more moments left than I do – please, take one of them to hear the ramblings of an old man.</p>

<p align=left>Now, whether you believe it or not, Britannia was once a glorious, magical kingdom. I wish you could have seen the knights in resplendent armor, riding forth from their castles to do battle with iniquity. Verity Isle – which is now called Moonglow – was where the scholars and wizards lived and learned, delving deeply into the secrets of the past and bringing many great discoveries to light. Adventurers and explorers wandered the land, cataloguing its many wonders. It was a time of legends.</p>

<p align=left>You know what legends are, don't you? They are stories, myths, fables – but more than that, they teach us, they inspire us, they dare us to become more than what we are. You may have heard one such legend, of the Avatar and his dauntless quest for Virtue. No? Well, that's all right. I suppose it was a long time ago. But surely you have heard of Lord British, no? It was he who first raised Britannia from the darkness and chaos of the past – indeed, without him, Britannia as we know it would not even exist. He ruled the land for many years, and his kingdom flourished. Many people came to him for his wise counsel and advice. It was he who brought about the creation of the Shrines, so that the people of Britannia would never forget the Virtues.</p>

<p align=left>And yet, they did forget. I cannot say when, nor why…but a change came over Britannia. Like a sickly fever, it stole silently across the land. Our eyes were open; we saw the symptoms. But we did nothing. Indeed, what could we have done? It was in the hands of the gods, but the gods also did nothing.</p>

<p align=left>I can still remember the first one. His name was Thomas, a simple lumberjack who kept mostly to himself. He never married, and I think that loneliness was a prison he unwittingly fashioned for himself. I can still remember his face when they brought him to us, and his tormented expression brought to my mind the full weight of the tragedy. He had never loved, nor would he ever love. All of the possibilities of his young life were gone, forever. And why? All because some foul brigand had killed him for the sake of a few gold coins.</p>

<p align=left>While we mourned for Thomas, we thought it was an isolated occurrence. For when had murder ever stained the noble lands of Britannia? But then we began to hear stories, of travelers brutally slaughtered in the night while traveling home to their families. Their families. Every day, more and more people were found dead in the woods. It sounds somehow distant, does it not? 'Found dead in the woods'. Each of these people had names, and faces. These were my friends, lying dead on the ground. I think we sometimes forget what a terrible thing is murder, the conscious act of ruining a life. No, not just the life, for that can sometimes be restored with the intervention of a mystical healer. But what of the money that the baker had been saving, to be able to send his only son to school in Britain? Gone. What of the wedding dress that the mother was bringing to her daughter? Gone. What of the innocence of the young boy out gathering ginseng to make a healing potion for his ill grandmother? Gone. Dreams, happiness, faith – these are the true victims of murder.</p>

<p align=left>And it only grew worse. Over the years, the wilderness has become unsafe to travel. Travelers no longer greet each other with friendly inquiries – now they keep a wary distance from one another, their hands on their swords, their eyes full of fear and suspicion. Miners and lumberjacks, who spend their lives doing hard, honest work – now their families go hungry because they are unable to venture outside the safety of town. We do not trust each other anymore. How can we? For when I turn around, it might be your dagger in my back. Add trust to the list of casualties in this war with no end.</p>

<p align=left>Naturally, we cast our eyes toward the Royal Castle. Certainly Lord British would come to our aid, as he had so many times in the past. Surely he would put right what had gone so horribly wrong. But do you know what we found? A closed portcullis. I remember standing there, my hands gripping those cold iron bars, hoping against hope to catch a glimpse of our King, so that I might implore him to help us. But there was no King to be seen. And many months later, when the portcullis was finally raised, we found only an empty throne.</p>

<p align=left>Lord British, to whom we had once looked as a beacon in times of peril. Lord British, who had given life to this land. Now he was nowhere to be found. The people felt as though they had been deserted in their most desperate hour of need. Today, Lord British is despised. Ask anyone, and you will be told that he is arrogant and selfish, that he cares not a whit for his people, and that he grows rich off of taxes, tariffs and levies like a parasitic leech. For my part, I do not know what to think. All I know is that there is no Lord British anymore. We have been left to fend for ourselves in a dark, kingless kingdom where villainy runs rampant and unchecked.</p>

<p align=left>Since there was no King we could turn to, we instead cast our eyes upward. No doubt you think us foolish for believing in the gods. Well, we had nowhere else to turn. Our people were dying – and I don't just mean a simple death, which can be reversed by a few simple words from a wandering healer. I'm talking about permanent death. I'm talking about watching good friends die, watching them leave Britannia and never return. It was like looking into the night sky and watching the stars go out, one by one, and the darkness just growing stronger and stronger.</p>

<p align=left>So we prayed. On our hands and knees, with hands clasped together in fervent hope, we prayed. Can you guess what was the result of our faith? Nothing. I spit out the word in disgust, for it is sour in my mouth. Britannia is a graveyard. If the maggots, vultures and other forces of decay had not removed the bodies, you could walk from Yew to Vesper on a giant carpet of blood and broken bones. How many people do you think have been murdered in the last year alone? How many decent, honest people have left this world, never to return? And the gods do nothing. They only sit back and watch, as if they had fashioned Britannia as some sort of gruesome arena, where the innocent are prey to the savage. I do not pray anymore, for my faith is dead.</p>

<p align=left>I make one last statement to the murderers themselves. It is too much to hope that they will read this, but I have even less hope that kings or gods will ever hear these words. The message is this: I curse you. Now and forever, for you have transformed into a nightmare of fear and hate what could have been a peaceful paradise. If I could sell my soul into everlasting torment to rid the world of the blight of you, I would gladly do so. But I cannot. It remains in the hands of kings and gods, and I curse them as well, because they are as much to blame as the villains themselves for allowing such cruel misdeeds to transpire.</p>

<p align=left>This is the torment of old age – looking back and seeing what once was, and comparing it with what is. Dark Britannia. A land without kings, without gods. A savage land where only the strong survive, and the rest become rotting meat along the roadways. Or is this what they wanted?</p>
