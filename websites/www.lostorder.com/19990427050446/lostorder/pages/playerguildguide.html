<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">Overview: Finding 
  a Guild for You!</font></b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You are at the point in 
  your online career that you wish to seek a guild, a group of players who will 
  hopefully enrich your online gaming experiences and perhaps lead to many new 
  friendships. Guilds come in many flavors, such as roleplaying, PVP (or powergaming), 
  or a mixture of both RP and PVP. In addition to those flavors is the age factor 
  of guilds, some are a younger crowd while others are older and a bit more reserved. 
  Top this off with the fact that there are literally thousands to choose from, 
  and you have yourself a heck of a task ahead of you. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this guide, I hope to 
  answer some questions, provide some helpful tips and hopefully point you in 
  the right direction in your quest for finding a home for you and your online 
  character.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">Giving All You've 
  Got!</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you are guildless and 
  looking, you are worth your weight in gold. There is a guild out there right 
  now looking for you, a guild that has hopes and dreams of becoming large, famous, 
  and prosperous. That is a great feeling for you, the guildless. You have some 
  power in your hands, if used properly. You should take time and do your homework, 
  search around, interview guild members in game or in IRC/Message Boards, ask 
  around, etc. Don't JUMP into anything, it isn't worth it. Once you find the 
  right guild and you believe in this guild, you truly should dedicate yourself 
  to making THAT guild the very best. You shouldn't expect a hand out, you shouldn't 
  expect people to pour all their time into you, and you shouldn't expect to have 
  your way with their hard-earned possessions in game. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I stated that you were needed 
  and wanted in a guild out there, and this is true. You deserve respect from 
  your guild of choice, you deserve some 'breaking in' time and some hands-on 
  training in the guild rules and goals. You do not however, deserve hand outs. 
  Once you join a guild, you become a part of that force and must contribute equally 
  to earn any forms of payment, rank, awards or wealth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a guild leader, I have 
  always focused on the PERSON behind the character, not the character. I focus 
  on what the person is like, morally. Does he/she worry about their share of 
  loot? Or do they first worry that everyone else is taken care of? If the person 
  applying for our guild is a truly nice person, giving and respectful, loyal 
  and hard working, they are THEN, and only then, worth their weight in gold. 
  I have witnessed players who sought to join a guild for one purpose, mooching 
  and leeching from our hard earned success, and often not wanting to offer anything 
  in return. Players like this jump from one guild to the next, often unable to 
  survive and persist in ANY guild for more than a month or two.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DON'T be that kind of guild 
  member... </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">What Do You Really 
  Want?</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You need to really think 
  hard about what you want in a guild. Who are you and what is your character 
  going to be like when you play? Are you evil? Are you good? Do you like the 
  ocean? Are you aspiring to tame dragons and use them to serve Justice? Do you 
  see yourself sacrificing innocents and praying to the dark gods of Sosaria/Norrath? 
  If you are joining a 'theme' guild, you will have to define your character before 
  applying or searching for a guild. Also, if your heart lies in the roleplaying 
  environment, please think hard before joining a PVP oriented guild. This is 
  a stereotype, but for the most part, PVP guilds aren't too fond of roleplayers, 
  and roleplayers don't mix well with PVP oriented people/guilds. It is a fact, 
  I have seen this first hand. If you can find a guild that truly loves both and 
  has worked to mesh the two styles, then jump on that application form and snatch 
  it up fast!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">The Roleplaying 
  Guild</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just because a guild says 
  they roleplay, doesn't mean they REALLY roleplay well. I have seen guilds claim 
  to be RP oriented, yet they were involved in major PVP, their RP skills, if 
  used, were horrible and crude, and they basically had a bad reputation. If a 
  guild is active and truly roleplays, you will see this quite clearly on their 
  public pages and forums. Their news will be written in a roleplay manner (sometimes), 
  their site will most likely have stories written in RP, their message boards 
  will usually have posts written in RP, and their chat rooms will readily accept 
  RPing within, and not look at you like an idiot. Of course, if you meet this 
  guild 'in game' and they roleplay well, that is a huge bonus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you wish to make a GREAT 
  impression on a guild of this nature, prepare a biography for your character 
  and tell the guild a story about your persona. Make them WANT to have you in 
  their guild. Also, when you fill out the application form, praise this guild 
  and tell them WHY you selected them to be your new home. Guilds love hearing 
  this, it helps pump up the motivation and also tells them indirectly that they 
  are doing SOMETHING right.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roleplaying guilds and players 
  are often stereotyped by PVP guilds as being goofy, stupid, queer, too caught 
  up in the game, etc. Depending on how deep your guild-choice is involved in 
  roleplaying, expect SOME negative comments from PVP guilds who fall under the 
  &quot;Immature&quot; category. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">The PVP Guild</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To join a PVP guild, you 
  pretty much need to know your stuff. You should be well versed in the various 
  skills in that game that are KEY to fighting prowess. If archery is the new 
  skill on the block, then learn it fast and master it. Most PVP players also 
  find comfort in the use of 3rd party programs, this isn't a bad thing, it is 
  simply a necessity. Your enemies have these tools and if you plan to survive 
  and help a guild get the 'edge' over their enemies, you need to have the proper 
  tools of the trade. Period. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have noticed that a lot 
  of PVP players feel the need to brag a lot. This isn't a blanket statement, 
  and it certainly doesn't apply to every player who PVPs, however, the majority 
  that I have met does fall into this category. I risk much by saying this, but 
  I strongly believe it to be true. If you can PVP well, that is a great thing 
  and you need to let the guild know. More importantly, you need to log in and 
  PROVE it. Get your hands dirty, kick some ass and take names. Even if you die, 
  at least you can make some form of impression on the guild you wish to join. 
  I think that if you can PVP well, and NOT brag and become arrogant about it, 
  you will be the very BEST PVP-type player in game.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have noticed that there 
  are two types of PVP guilds: <b>Immature</b> and <b>Mature</b>. You will find 
  that many (not all) younger players fall into the Immature area, and hey, that 
  is normal. They are young, impressionable, and they readily fit in to that crowd. 
  I am not making fun of them here, simply making an observation. Also, this younger 
  crowd of PVPrs aren't too shabby, they are effective at fighting styles. One 
  of the major downfalls of this crowd is their use of bad language, game exploiting, 
  hacks, cheats, abusive actions against other players, and last but not least, 
  the use of &quot;KeWlDuDe'ish&quot; typing. This form of player seeks to not 
  only hurt the characters in game, but seeks to hurt the player behind the keyboard 
  on an emotional level. As you can see, this is my opinion and my guide, so take 
  this with a grain of salt and make of it what you will. I am sure I will get 
  lots of flak for this. To counter this statement, I can say that I *have* met 
  young players (13-14yr) who were every bit as mature as the others in our guild.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As for the Mature PVP guild, 
  they are quite simply the best to join. They are respectful of the roleplaying 
  guilds, and give them room to breath. They are perfectionists at the art of 
  PVPing, they often use the 3rd party programs to further excel at PVP, and their 
  members refrain *usually* from the use of bad language, exploits, abusive behavior, 
  etc. Simply put, they love PVP and enjoy a good fight. They aren't looking to 
  hurt the PLAYER behind the character. If you to join a good PVP guild that is 
  worth anything and will make you a better person, join the Mature PVP guild. 
  They are out there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Mixed Guild of RP 
  and PVP</b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It exists, I swear. I happen 
  to love this form of guild, and I should, this is what I created long ago with 
  the other LOA founding fathers. It is a volatile mixture, that is for sure, 
  and it takes time to nurture and build. To this day, we still have some issues 
  creep up on us, and sometimes, it leads to revolts, members quitting, hurt feelings 
  and a drop in guild moral. A large price to pay for a diversified guild. At 
  any rate, if you can find a guild like this, in the shard/server of your choice, 
  strongly consider it. It gives you access to creative playing styles, up to 
  date information on in-game plots and stories, as well as access to very competant 
  PVP players. If you join a guild like this, make sure you take your time to 
  get acquainted first, before jumping right in. Get to know the members, the 
  guild history, the mentality behind what is right and wrong for that guild, 
  etc. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think that revolts and 
  guild upsets are frequent in this form of group because you have to very different 
  'goals' and 'mentality'. The roleplayers aren't big on Anti- or Pking. The RPrs 
  often feel that 3rd party programs are 'cheating', they feel that the PVPrs 
  perhaps earn all the fame and often considered the 'heroes' when they answer 
  a call for help, or lead a successful raid. There is also the &quot;Circle&quot; 
  effect that diverse guilds face. When you have two or three elements in a guild, 
  such as RP and PVP, you will see very defined 'circles' of friendships taking 
  place. The RP members bond together, and the PVP members bond together, and 
  then some members find friendships in BOTH groups. So long as the member to 
  member respect is healthy and enforced, this situation will not blow up on you. 
  If a highly successful or famous player on the RP or the PVP circle comes under 
  'percieved' attack by the other members of the guild, or the Council of the 
  guild, expect the boat to rock. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a player in a guild like 
  this, expect moral issues to come into play, it happens. If you still strongly 
  believe in the leadership and the ideals of the guild, be loyal and faithful 
  to the GUILD and the leadership, not the members who have personal issues with 
  the guild and leadership. I have seen people quit, thinking they were making 
  the right decision, only to ask for readmittance days or weeks later. They got 
  caught up in someone else's problems, and left without thinking about how much 
  happiness they truly found in that guild. Luckily, our guild believes that members 
  in good standing should readily be allowed back into our fold, for they made 
  a mistake and learned from it. Other guilds aren't so forgiving, so make sure 
  you hold your tongue until you are 100% sure you wish to go... </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">Donations, Time 
  and Involvment for the Guild!</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I just wanted to stress 
  how important it is that you donate all that you can to your guild. Donate gold, 
  items, your Real Life skills (html, cgi, graphics, etc.), etc. in an effort 
  to make your guild stand out above the rest. &quot;It takes a village.&quot;, 
  and everyone needs to work together in the success of the guild.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please realize that the 
  guild leadership cannot do it all, they rely heavily upon the time and efforts 
  of all members in making the guild all that it can be. As a member, your in 
  game actions can lead to good press (i.e. saving someone from a PK, being a 
  ruthless killer, donating gold to newbies, guiding someone to a shop they are 
  looking for, etc.), and you out-of-game actions ALSO can lead to good press 
  (i.e. Intelligent posts to public message boards, game resource pages for players, 
  leading a cause for the game you play, donating graphics to other players, etc.) 
  - all of these things inevitably lead to great advertising for your guild. So 
  do it, and let others know why YOUR guild is the best.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">Reporting Your 
  Actions</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In closing, here is a tip 
  for ALL guild members, no matter WHAT form of guild you are in. If you want 
  to progress, get awards, get promotions, become famous, earn respect, etc. - 
  you need to make your deeds and actions KNOWN to everyone in your guild. The 
  best way to do this is via a report. Simply write your report of your deed/s 
  via your guild mailing list, message board, icq, etc. and send it to everyone 
  who is in your guild. Do this, and be proud. :)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actually, the LOA has found 
  that the stories submitted (often in RP style) were excellent sources for advertising 
  our guild to the RP community. In addition, getting screenshots of PVP battles 
  and writing stories in OOC also lead to great advertising to the PVP players 
  out there. Again, the members of the guild made a huge impact on our success.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2">In Closing</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I hope that this helps all 
  of you seeking to become a member of a guild, or seeking to get noticed more 
  in the guild you are in. There is no reason why you should simply &quot;BE&quot; 
  in a guild and not contribute as much as possible. As a member of a guild, you 
  can make a humungous impact and lead your friends to great success and fame. 
  Don't hold back, be creative, be inventive, be involved and be thankful.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, if you feel that the 
  leadership or the guild overall is no longer as good as it used to be, make 
  sure you mention this in meetings, using tact, of course. As a member, you deserve 
  the chance to share your concerns and keep the leadership of that guild on track. 
  Without good leaders, a guild will most likely fail. If your leaders cannot 
  handle your 'tactful' comments, perhaps it is time to begin your quest and search 
  for another guild.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The very last thing I want 
  to mention is... you are playing a game, your guild is comprised of many different 
  people, different ages, different nationalities, and different moral codes. 
  Don't get too personally involved in anything that will make you an unhappy 
  person. Have FUN with the games you play and the guild you are in. I have gone 
  full circle now, and I know very well the 'personal' side of being in a guild. 
  I have lost sleep, I have lost friends I met online, I have been depressed at 
  times, etc. This is all part of being in a guild and associated with people 
  on a day to day basis. If you know you cannot handle such things, avoid a guild 
  altogether and keep things simple.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Good luck!</font></p>
