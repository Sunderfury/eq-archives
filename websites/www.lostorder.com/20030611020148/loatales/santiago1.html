<p align=left><b>Lacey Ebonwind</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>For the next few days, he avoided going to the tavern. He spent his days doing chores for the monks – running errands, chopping lumber, carrying heavy boxes around. Simple, mindless work, for a simple, mindless bloke; it suited him well. His quiet time he spent fishing or walking through the woods, listening to the sounds of the natural world.</p>

<p align=left>He kept to himself as much as he could. From time to time, he encountered a friendly monk or a talkative townsperson, and would be forced into a conversation he would rather have avoided. Even a simple ‘hello’ became noisome, and a ‘how are you’ was tantamount to torture. He would simply don a false smile, and reply, “Fine…how are you?” It got to the point where he simply wanted to hide whenever he saw someone coming up the forest path. He prayed for solitude; he was desperate for it. He spent hours in the remotest parts of the wilderness, or the most distant parts of the shore, or locked away in his room at the abbey.</p>

<p align=left>Inevitably, he grew tired of it. It was the story of his life; whenever he finally had whatever it was he wanted, he then found that he didn’t want it anymore. After finding solitude at last, he suddenly desired companionship. After finding a horde of treasure in the South Seas, he gave it all away and returned to the simple life of a fisherman. What would he do if he ever managed to find love? Would it just be a passing storm? Would it be delicious at first, only to grow sour over time? Perhaps he was just plain fickle, as capricious as the ocean wind.</p>

<p align=left>So it was, that no less than a week after seeing Zyla in the arms of another man, his boots once again followed the unmarked path through the forest, toward the old tavern in the woods. He wanted to see the familiar faces again, wanted to hear laughter and gossip. He wanted to be among the living again.</p>

<p align=left>The twilight air was cool and pleasant, but he could see storm clouds in the distance, like a dark army approaching. The rain had not yet begun, but it was only a matter of time.</p>

<p align=left>The tavern was its same old self. The rough, grainy wood of the bar felt familiar to him as he took his accustomed seat in the corner. The tantalizing aroma of grilled fish and baked bread set his mouth watering, and it was not long before Myste was providing him with yet another generous meal.</p>

<p align=left>By the time he was done eating, it had started to rain outside. Few people entered the tavern, and few people left. No one felt like going outside and getting wet; this was a night for staying inside. There was a warm fire in the hearth, and the tavern was filled with the sounds of conversation, music and laughter.</p>

<p align=left>Then, all at once, two momentous things occurred. First, a flash of light could be seen outside the windows, followed very closely by a thunderclap so loud it seemed as if the bolt might have struck the tavern itself. Everyone jumped in fright. Some of the women shrieked and held their hands to their chests, while the men simply chuckled and pretended that they had not been startled themselves. Then they noticed the stranger in the doorway…</p>

<p align=left>Framed by rain and lightning, even her silhouette was impressive – tall and slender, with curves in all the right places. She stood there for a moment, a shadow at the entrance, gazing silently at the tavern patrons who gazed silently back. Then she entered, and her features came fully into view. And what features they were! Her hair was long and dark, the sultry crimson of late autumn leaves. Her eyes were a brilliant shade of sapphire-blue, and they seemed to gleam with a fierce inner light as she scowled at the men nearby.</p>

<p align=left>Santiago’s eyes traveled down from her face, on a delightful journey to the rest of her figure. Her leather armor was tight-fitting, and though it didn’t reveal very much, what it did show was enough to make a fella’s heart start to pound. In the few places the armor did not cover, he saw smooth, tanned flesh. It was like tasting tiny drops of the sweetest nectar; he found himself desperately wanting to see more. When she moved, it was with an elegance that many might envy, but few could imitate. Her legs were long and shapely as she walked toward the bar, and the sound made by her tall, black leather boots was the only sound to be heard.</p>

<p align=left>A young lumberjack nearby grinned lustily and reached out to put his hand on her thigh. As if in slow motion, she grabbed his arm with one hand and drew a thin, wicked knife with the other. The peasant yelled in pain as the knife pinned his hand to the table in front of him.</p>

<p align=left>“Let that be a lesson to ye,” she hissed in his ear. “Keep yer hands to yerself, or ye might lose ‘em.”</p>

<p align=left>“Blimey!” thought Santiago. “What a woman!” He would probably always remember her this way, an alluring combination of beauty and deadliness, a gorgeous shadow that had walked in out of a stormy night.</p>

<p align=left>She moved to the bar and sat down right next to Santiago. “Give me a drink,” she said to the bartender, “an’ make it a strong one.” She glanced at Santiago. “Pick yer jaw up off the ground, idiot,” she growled. “Someone might step on it.”</p>

<p align=left>“Sorry, milady,” he said. “Din’t mean no offense.”</p>

<p align=left>She smirked. “No, o’ course not. Ye fellas never mean no offense, do ye? But somehow ye still manage to cause it.”</p>

<p align=left>“Beggin’ yer pardon, milady, I think I’ll move somewhar else. It’s plain to see as ye’d rather eat alone.” He stood up, grabbing his bottle and his plate of food.</p>

<p align=left>“No, please,” she said, her voice softer. She placed her hand on his arm. “Stay.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago paused a moment, then returned to his seat.</p>

<p align=left>“I’m sorry I snapped at ye. It’s just been a long bloody day, an’ I’m just about at the end o’ me rope. Me ship came in with the storm,” she said, her eyes lifting upward, “and now I’m stranded here in this miserable little town ‘til she can be repaired.”</p>

<p align=left>“Blimey, milady! Yer a sea captain? Errr…captainess?”</p>

<p align=left>She threw him a shifty smile and extended her hand. “Lacey Ebonwind. Adventurer, explorer and…pirate.” The last word she added as a whisper in his ear, which made him shudder in delight.</p>

<p align=left>“Ye don’t say!” exclaimed Santiago. “Me name’s Santiago, milady, an’ it just so happens I’m a sailor meself! Well, more of a wharf rat if the truth is to be laid out. An’ while I’m at it, I hope ye won’t put a dag in me tongue if I say that yer one o’ the pertiest ladies I ever did see.” He blushed slightly and tipped his cap to her.</p>

<p align=left>Lacey’s eyes brightened for a moment, then quickly returned to their former gloominess. “Ye ought not say such things,” she growled.</p>

<p align=left>Santiago wrinkled his brow at her. “But why not, milady? It ain’t nothin’ more than the truth…?”</p>

<p align=left>She shook her head, still refusing to meet his gaze. “It’s the kind o’ thing ye’d say to someone what ye were in love with. An’ I don’t want to be in love, not ever again.” The bottle arrived, and she gratefully poured herself a drink.</p>

<p align=left>“I’d say as somebody did ye a bad turn, milady.”</p>

<p align=left>Lacey swallowed the bitter-tasting liquid and nodded her head. “Ye might say that. He went an’ died on me.”</p>

<p align=left>“Ah hell, milady. I’m right sorry to hear that.” He regarded her silently for a moment. “But ye ought not to give up on yer heart like that, sayin’ ye’ll never love again. It’s like sayin’ that, just ‘cause ye been to the Isle o’ Winter, that means ye won’t never be warm again. It’s like sayin’ that, just ‘cause yer starvin’, that means ye won’t never have nothin’ to eat again. Ye been wounded, milady, but wounds either heal themselves or they kill ye. An’ ye look like yer still breathin’, so I’d say it were just a matter o’ time b’fore yer all better.”</p>

<p align=left>She said nothing for several moments, and when she looked up at him again, there were tears in her eyes. “Ye think so? Ye really think so?”</p>

<p align=left>He reached for her hand and held it gently in his own. “I know so, milady.”</p>
