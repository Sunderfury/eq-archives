<blockquote>
<p align=left>I swear, me memory just ain't what it used to be. There be all sorts of new folks around, and I jest can't get all the names straight no more. I been thinkin' though, mayhap someone could write up some list or somethin', then maybe I'll have an easier time remberin' all the names. O'course, I could use a few lessons on readin' and writin' meself.</p>

<p align=left>Jest I was 'bout to hunt near Hebian, I heard that some fellah named Kiyo-Jima was lookin' fer some company. Seems he be one of them new folk, lookin' to join the Order. So, I found Kileyan playin' in the snow as usual and told him we should allow this Jima fellah to hunt with us. Then outta nowhere, ole Valdox shows up too, swingin' that crazy flamin' cestus around. I swear, Valdox needs to lay off the liquor a little before he hurts someone. So we waited in Hebian, anxious to meet the Jima fellah fer the first time.</p>

<p align=left>Kiyo-Jima finally showed up, runnin' from somewhere....or someone. He had this crazed look in his eye, sorta like Kileyan. Jest as I thought, he messes with them crazy magicks. One of these days they'll learn that magick jest ain't natural. But Kiyo turned out to be an honest bloke, an' smart too. I reckon he can read pretty well too, after hearin' all them fancy words he uses. We still had to test him where it counts the most, so we planned our hunt.</p>

<p align=left>Off we went, to the bloody lich tower near Tou Tou. I sure as hell wouldn't hunt there by meself, but the four of us were more than any lich could handle. The battles were fierce, with them liches castin' their bloody magicks at us, rippin' poor Valdox to shreds. But we held our ground, and soon enough the liches were no more. Seems Kiyo can fight pretty well too, I don't know how him an' Valdox can stand toe to toe with them liches. Methinks Kileyan healed them jest in time to save their hides. Some more folks showed up a bit later, so we decided to mend our wounds and head back towards Tou Tou.</p>

<p align=left>Tasslehof himself was loiterin' around in Tou Tou, so we decided to rest there and share some stories. Methinks Tass wants to take Kiyo on one of his crazy suicide trips, so I'll have to warn him before it's too late. Someday we'll head back to the mattekar cave though, I'd sure like another shot at them foul beasts.</p>
