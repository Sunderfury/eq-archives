<p align=left><b>Journal - Day One</b><br><i>by Wysll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I am unsettled. Perhaps writing down this evening's events will help me make sense of them...and the fact that the roof over my head is not the earth and rock that Brell meant it to be isn't helping things. </p>

<p align=left>Well, we all met in the tavern as Wyll instructed us to, and for a while the old ways of brothers came back. There were seven of us: Myself, Wyll, Wyloon, Wyndelle, Wumpus, Wyxle, and another, Vojo - not a Walaryn, but known and trusted. </p>

<p align=left>I immediately sensed that this was no 'excuse' for a reunion - Wyll was deadly earnest. The fact that Useah had summoned him wasn't comforting. Wyll is the least versed in the arcane arts of all of us - yet one as mighty as Useah had summoned Wyll instead of one more accomplished in the ways of majik...was unprecedented. </p>

<p align=left>The rest of the evening fared no better. An ancient tome housing a margin note of our clan name? Inconceivable! Even worse was the fact that the prophecy was mostly destroyed. Our Uncle Wyndsor knows most of our family history, so we thought to question him about it. I really don't know what I expected. Certainly not what we saw. Our uncle, in times past, was more outgoing than the uncooperative old gnome we met. All he would give us was a name - Wyzer. </p>

<p align=left>The old wizard was little better - old Wyzer was maddingly obtuse. All he would do was mumble something about a whirlwind, and dark Walaryn female, and a stone bird showing the way. Things were getting more confusing instead of less! We decided to set out for an aviak temple someone remembered of in the Lesser Faydark. </p>

<p align=left>After an interminable trip led by Wyloon (I swear...his Sense Heading must be in negative numbers), we finally made it. And no clue presented itself. As we were talking about our options, Wyll mounted the pedestal of the stone bird...and started speaking in a strangely altered voice. </p>

<p align=left>I strangely can't remember all of it. I remember him speaking of the West and East wind...and then collapsing. I can remember many different spells, but not the dire words spoken in a trance by my brother! Ah - my memory will be my downfall, I'm sure of it. I can see it now...vainly trying to recall the incantation for 'Root' at an inopportune time... </p>

<p align=left>Anyway, we knew we didn't have the knowledge to find the answer to this latest riddle. The Erudites are learned in all kinds of lore, but are too far a journey for something this important. </p>

<p align=left>So we're in Felwithe...I still can't stand sleeping under a wood roof. Wyndelle is snoring - maybe if he quits I can get some sleep. I thought about waking him, but he'll just start snoring again. </p>

<p align=left>Maybe the next few days will produce more answers than questions - but I don't think so.</p>
