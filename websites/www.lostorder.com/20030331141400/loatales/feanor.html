<p align=left><b>A Moment to Remember</b><br><i>by Feanor</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A cool breeze swept down off the nearby mountains as Feanor emerged
from the forest into a small clearing. The forest had claimed most
of the clearing over the long years. Vines and underbrush were now 
entrenched on the side of the ruins which poked out in the middle
of the clearing. Feanor was familiar with this place. This place
held much happiness and much sorrow in his heart. It was his home
of an age gone by. With a heavy sigh Feanor walked into the clearing
and knelt just outside what once had been a house. There was not
much of a house there, just a few stones from its foundations were
left poking out of the ground. Taking his eyes from the ruins he set
his shield on the ground, then set his kryss across the shield.
From a small pouch Feanor produced a lilly and held it out infront
of himself.</p>

<p align=left>"I have not forgotten thee my friends....my family........my love."
A single tear trickled down his left cheek as memories flooded his mind.</p>

<p align=left>The smell of battle was still thick in the air. Bodies of elves, drows,
and orcs littered the ground. Buildings were burning all around him.
But his attention was only on the dead body of his love laying across 
his lap. Memories receeded back to the present.....</p>

<p align=left>Laying the lilly down on the ground infront of him he produced yet
another lilly from his pouch. He turned his attention to the 
mountains in the distance that towered above the trees of the forest.
Memories once again invaded his mind....</p>

<p align=left>The cavern was dank and dark yet the small elvish host of warriors
proceeded deeper into its depths. "Perhaps we should rest for a 
moment my love.." A fair elvish women had made her way to the front
of the group where Feanor lead his companions. Turning to face 
Elwing he could barely make out her features but he knew of her 
beauty. "We must continue, we must flush out these drows and orcs
from our lands. Have ye not heard the tale of what they did to my home
many years ago?" His argument was suddenly broken as Feanor took on
another train of thought. "Why could you have not stayed back in 
the village?" Elwing placed her hand on her hip and gave him a smile.
He hated when she did that, it made her even more lovely to him.
"So you do care for me.....but do you love me?" She moved closer
placing her hand on Feanors shoulder. "I do care for you as I do
for all those with me on this journey." Feanor took a deep breath
as he looked deep into her eyes "And I do..." His word were cut short
as an arrow pierced Elwing in the chest. Time slowed in that instant.
Feanor grabbed her falling body and fell with her to the ground.
The cries of his comrades echoed in the back of his mind as they
rushed forward to meet the hidden attackers. The drumming of his heart
filled his ears as he watched the life train out of Elwings face.
"I do love ye..." was all he could manage. Elwing smiled and raised
her hand to caress Feanors face one last time before going limp.
Memories receeded once again, but the pain of them remained.</p>

<p align=left>Another tear trickled down Feanors right cheek. "I have not forgotten
you Elwing...." He placed the last lilly next to the other one.
Wiping the tears from his face he stood and walked to the edge of the
clearing, turning to gaze over the ruins for one last time then was gone.</p>

<p align=left>The bushes rustled at the far side of the small clearing, curses followed
the noised. A lone rogue emerged from the forest and cautiously 
approached the area where Feanor had been. "Now what was dat der guy
up too." The shield and kryss caught the mans eye and we quickly
stumbled over to the artifacts. In his haste the lillies that had
been placed by Feanor were ignorantly trampled on and left embedded
in the mans boot print. The rogue whistled to himself. 
"I be sure dat dees here wud fetch a purty price" Grabbing the items
the rogue looked around one last time before darting off into the forest.</p>
