<p align=left><b>Novice Mage's Journal, Entry Two</b><br><i>by Baltazir</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>My, but it's been awhile since I last wrote in my journal. A lot has happened since that initial entry...where to begin...</p>

<p align=left>After first braving the lands of Dereth, I returned and again hunted near Lytelthorp. This time, though, I picked my battles carefully and knocked off solo drudges and shreths. Eventually, I earned enough money to buy a fine leather breastplate to protect me innards.</p>

<p align=left>While taking a break, and downing a mug or three of ale, I received word from Karas-Zan. He asked that I travel to Shoushi to meet up with him. I agreed and headed out of town to try and find a portal route there. Being new, however, my sense of direction isn't all that strong and I must've picked the wrong road out of town. Needless to say, the road was not safe to journey upon and I soon found myself fleeing from prowlers and shreth and drudge and the like. A few nicks and scrapes were gathered, but my quick feet kept me a step or two ahead of the beasties. That was until I ran across this flying wasp. Blue in color, I think it was...but didn't get long to look. I felt a painful slash across the back of me neck. I didn't stop running but did reach back to assess the damage. Then, all of a sudden, fire and heat surrounded me. Next thing I knew, I was back beside the ever-present lifestone...still remembering that blazing heat and shuddering.</p>

<p align=left>Back in town, I got more reliable directions and made my way through the portals to Shoushi. There I met up with Karas-Zan. We talked, and he helped me get better armor, and we headed off to search the dungeon on the hillside near town. We quickly found that we worked well as a team...knocking the beasties down with deadly precision.</p>

<p align=left>We have wandered the dungeon many a time since...both growing in power and resource...and cementing our friendship. When we get a little stronger, and kill our foes a little quicker, mayhap we will delve to the bowels of that foul place to see what treasure she hides. I'm sure I'll have much more to write about then...</p>
