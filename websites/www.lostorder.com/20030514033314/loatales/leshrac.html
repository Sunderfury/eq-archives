<p align=left><b>Ghouls and Ghosts</b><br><i>by Leshrac</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A silence broke out as the being entered the tavern. Although used to seing such a foul manifestation of evil in the bar, Leshrac's entrance still filled the patrons with trepidation. With an inner smile the ghost made his way over to the table where Tara and Lucus sat. As usual the young thing Attrael was flapping his lip and brandishing his sword, If he keeps that up I will forgo my other plans and concentrate on him, I thought. No matter.</p>

<p align=left>Tara: "Leshrac, I have a favor to ask you one that would leave me in your debt."</p>

<p align=left>-Oh? And what isss that missstresss?</p>

<p align=left>*As she pointed to the lying body our fair Nephilim was munching on, I noticed twas Arch'ist Gale a certain tormented Lightbringer*</p>

<p align=left>-Could you revive him? Like Gloomshade revived my boat man?</p>

<p align=left>-Well, I could. But it depenssss... Firssstly how did he die?</p>

<p align=left>-Well..." Tara's words drifted off as I had a vision of the past: A woman child, yes it was Mary. Bentley trying to make her drink something. Attrael his katana crashing down on Bentley, twas so like that Hot headed lightbringer to attack anything that moved, and Arch'ist heroically but foolishly leaping in front of the blade.</p>

<p align=left>" Ah I sssee, well..." As thoughts rushed throught my mind on what I should do to this blashpemous man my train of thought came to a crashing halt as I realised to whom I was speaking to.</p>

<p align=left>" But thou sssee, the Wraithlord hasss clearly developped an interessst in thee and I would never dare nor wisssh sssteal hisss toysss.</p>

<p align=left>-I see, well I will deal with him then. But could thee revive him? So his soul is not lost?"</p>

<p align=left>My first thought was to immediatly reject but then something from the far past came to haunt me, like a vision from the all consuming himself. Yes that is it!</p>

<p align=left>-Of courssse! Twill be temporary of courssse, till thou deal with the Wraithlord himssself.</p>

<p align=left>Attrael made some comment about black magic and why he himself couldn't heal Arch, what a fool!</p>

<p align=left>-Tisss sssimple Attrael, He does nay WANT to be brought back."</p>

<p align=left>I laughed and began the chant to his ebashed face.</p>
<p align=left>As I began to chant the summon of his soul, a slight giddyness envaded my whole corpus. Oh this was going to be sooo entertaining!</p>
<p align=left>
"Bâhum màkté,<br> 
Fîghal màkté,<br> 
Ikârate digal let flûke ikatöre.<br> 
Basak<br> 
Lökté màs ad avrak nàkar</p>

<p align=left>I am the thorn in the foot, I am the blur in the sight<br>
I am the worm at the root, I am the thief in the night<br>
I am the rat in the wall, the leper that leers at the gate<br> 
I am the ghost in the hall, herald of horror and hate<br> 
I am the rust on the corn, I am the smut on the wheat<br> 
Laughing man's labor to scorn, weaving a web for his feet.<br> 
I am canker and mildew and blight, danger and death and decay<br> 
The rot of the rain by night, the blast of the sun by day<br> 
I warp and wither with drought, I work in the swamp's foul yeast<br> 
I bring the black plague from the south and leprosy in from the east<br> 
I am the shrill cold spirit that chills the darkness you feel after dark<br> 
I am the chaos that tears stars apart.<br> 
You cannot escape me<br> 
You cannot defeat me<br> 
You can only embrace me<br> 
Arise puppet and let blessed Entropy pull thy ssstringsss!"</p>

<p align=left>The patrons stared in horror as the body picked itself off the ground. Arch arose but not as a normal human, as a being between the worlds, as a flesh eating ghoul. I turned to Tara.</p>

<p align=left>"I will inform the Wraithlord we have a bargain."</p>
