<p align=left><b>The Ashes of Eden</b><br><i>by Scribe of Unter Brae</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The evening musk saturated the air with evergreen as two sages were speaking of the Awakening outside the Fitzowen Hall of the Arts. The winds began to pick up, and a shriek of animosity bellowed. The two sages curiously turned their ear in the direction of the large, empty house that lay south of the Inn of Your Dreams. For the past several months, sounds from that house began to grow in intensity and in frequency. For the first time, the sounds had some coherency.</p>

<p align=left>The Sage of Valor covered his ears and exclaimed, “What is the forsaken racket!?!”</p>

<p align=left>The Sage of Spirituality replied, “It is he who haunts the abandoned house. Only this time, there is fluidity in his moaning. Let’s go investigate.”</p>

<p align=left>As a precaution, the Sage of Valor, JackDeth, wielded his sword as the two men approached the decaying house that sits in front of the Inn of Your Dreams. It serves as a painful reminder of the dark times in Unter Brae when Navrip Freemech and his dark minions destroyed the city. Very few people have frequented the place as tales of its haunting spread throughout the land, and kept people away. The Sage of Spirituality used a little extra effort to force open the door. The hinges squeaked loudly as evidenced by the rust and mildew within. A rush of malodorous air swept out of the house, and the two men let out an uncomfortable cough.</p>

<p align=left>“There it is! The apparition appears before us!” </p>

<p align=left>“Halt Jack! Let us speak with it!” The Sage of Spirituality, Inia Geoffrensis, prevented JackDeth from lunging at the spirit.</p>

<p align=left>“Ahm. Ahm. Ahm, “ droned the ghost.</p>

<p align=left>“Interesting. The spirit speaks of the mantra of Honesty. He must have lost his way on the way to the Shrine of Honesty.” JackDeth holstered his weapon and replied to Inia, “Perhaps. Ask what the ghost wants.”</p>

<p align=left>As Inia turned to the spirit, it spoke again, “Mu. Mu. Mu.”</p>

<p align=left>“Ra. Beh. Summ. Cah. Om. Lum. Why hast thou forgotten me, my child? Why? Dost thou not remember me? Why?” The spirit’s cries grew louder and louder.</p>

<p align=left>“I know of thee, spirit?” The apparition turned, and in the blink of an eye, appeared right in front of Inia. JackDeth wielded his sword once again, and began to lunge.</p>

<p align=left>Inia gave the spirit a long, hard look, and exclaimed, “Wait Jack. I know of this spirit. How could I have forgotten thee? I have forgotten the man who saved my life in the battle of Unter Brae!” Inia fell to his knees and begged the spirit for forgiveness. “I am sorry, milord, for I have failed to honor thy memory.” The spirit smiled at Inia and said, “Now thou hast remembered me, thou canst honor me and release me by rebuilding paradise here in Unter Brae.” Inia and JackDeth both curiously looked at the spirit as it was speaking. Before both Sages’ eyes, eight roses appeared on the decaying hardwood floor. Each rose was named after each virtue. The spirit continued on, “Destroy this house as it harbors painful memories of a distant past. Rebuild paradise!”</p>

<p align=left>“How shall I rebuild paradise, milord?” </p>

<p align=left>“Use the fertile soil, mother nature’s womb! Ask for a garden symbolic to the eight virtues!”</p>

<p align=left>“Whom shall I ask, milord?”</p>

<p align=left>“Speak to the citizens of Britannia, and thou shalt be heard!”</p>

<p align=left>“Thank you, milord. I shall release thy spirit by rebuilding paradise for thee.”</p>

<p align=left>The spirit nodded, and vanished into the evening air. “Who was the apparition that demanded Eden be restored here in Unter Brae,” JackDeth asked Inia. </p>

<p align=left>With a heavy sigh, Inia coldly stared into JackDeth’s eyes and exhaled, “He was my father.”</p>
