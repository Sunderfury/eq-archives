<blockquote>
<p align=left>“How dare he do that!” Metry huffed. “He had no right, that old charlatan!”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy put an hand on Metry’s arm. “Don’t worry about it. I’m sure he meant no harm.”</p>

<p align=left>“No harm?” he balked. “What was he trying to do, read you a bed time story?”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy glared at him. “He was probably just trying to make things interesting! How would ‘Oh, in the coming months Lindsy will be doing initiate duties and Metry will be guarding the temple,’ sound? Not very interesting. Come on, let’s enjoy the rest of the fair.”</p>

<p align=left>Metry grumbled. “All right. Let’s enjoy it.”</p>

<p align=left>The rest of the day passed fairly quickly. The event in the tent was soon forgotten and Lindsy and Metry just enjoyed their day. Metry managed to win a small trinket for Lindsy at one of the games, even though he was sure it was fixed. Metry vowed to have the militia check it out, though nothing ever came of it. </p>

<p align=left>They traveled back to Metry’s home for a short time before heading back to the temple. Metry had guard duty and needed to change into his armor. His house was nothing more than a two room wood building with an outhouse, but it was home to him. </p>

<p align=left>All his possessions were there and he never planned on leaving it. But he’d need to if he ever became a family man. And with Lindsy, he might just need to. As he thought these thoughts, he thought how foolish his thinking was. They’d only just met and he was all ready thinking of a family. Such a foolish thought.</p>

<p align=left>He went to unlock the door to his home when he noticed that the knob was broken. “Damn,” he muttered, drawing the slender dagger he never left home without. “Lindsy, stay out here. There might be trouble.”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy nodded and stared at him, not making a sound. Metry opened the door gently and slid into the house. His eyes darted around in the dark, looking for any sign of movement. He saw none and slowly crept forward. He strained to hear something, but not a sound came to him. Not even his own breathing.</p>

<p align=left>He forced himself to loosen up and sucked in some air. The small sound of his voice carried strongly through the house. He heard movement come from the other room. He tensed up again and crept forward. His foot hit a cabinet, making a slight banging sound. Suddenly, a heavy weight fell on his back.</p>

<p align=left>He shouted out and jammed his dagger backwards, penetrating the armor of the attacker. He reached behind, attempting to grab the hair of his foe and fling him forward. What he found, or didn’t find, terrified him. There was no hair, nor a head for it to grow from. He grabbed the arms of the creature and heaved it forward. </p>

<p align=left>More sound came from the second room. A quiet frenzied banging. But Metry was too concerned with his headless attacker who lay flat on the ground. He bent over to check on it. When he did, he swore to himself. It was his chain mail armor, now with a good sized dagger hole in it. It must have fallen from it’s resting place on the shelf onto his back when he bumped it.</p>

<p align=left>The noise from the second room seemed to have stopped, but Metry was taking no chances. He grabbed a lantern and lit it quickly. He flung the door open and held the light and dagger up threateningly. Cries of fright rose from the corner. He turned and saw three neighborhood children, obviously caught in some mischevious act.</p>

<p align=left>“What are you doing here?” Metry said angrily, but with relief evident in his voice.</p>

<p align=left>The largest kid seemed ready to speak when another scream pierced the night air. It was Lindsy. Metry bolted out of the room and out into the night. He clutched the dagger and lantern as he ran. Lindsy wasn’t at the door, but two pairs of tracks were evident in the ground. He charged after them.</p>

<p align=left>After what seemed hours in his mind, he finally came upon her. There was a dark shape looming over her and she didn’t make a sound. Metry yelled out in anger and dove at the shape as it turned around. Metry’s dagger plunged into it over and over. Inhuman cries of pain came from it’s lips. Finally, it cried no more.</p>

<p align=left>Metry immediately checked on Lindsy, who was sitting up, shaking in fright. “Are you all right?” he asked, taking her into his arms. She nodded weakly and buried herself into his chest. He held her tight for an eternity too short before he released her and went to check on her attacker.</p>

<p align=left>He held the lantern up close and sighed in relief. It was just a bunyip, a type of local monkey. Completely harmless, but very curious, they rarely ventured this close to the city. In the shadows of the night, no wonder Lindsy had been frightened. Her fright probably excited the animal as it chased after her.</p>

<p align=left>“Come on,” Metry said, helping her up. “Everything’s fine. Let’s get back to the temple.”</p>
