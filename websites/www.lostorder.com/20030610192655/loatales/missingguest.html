<p align=left><b>The Missing Guest</b><br><i>by Mary</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The air outside the tower was fresh and clean, the birds were singing sweetly and the sun had never shone as brightly as it did this day. It was truly a beautiful day for a wedding. The ceremony went off without a hitch and now Lord Aleph Aiers and Lady Azrielle were man and wife. The young couple would share many happy times together in the years ahead for this was undoubtedly a 'happily ever after' fairytale ending. Even now the guests celebrated the union of the newlyweds inside Fitzowen Hall. The singing and merry making could be heard for miles. Then from outside, a child's laughter turns suddenly to screams of terror. The guests run to the tower walls to see what has transpired only to be struck immobilized in fear at the sight below. Dragons! Dragons everywhere surrounding the tower exits on all sides. What could this mean? </p>

<hr width=600 align=center color="#24090E">

<p align=left>The young girl screamed as the White Wyrmm opened its mouth and let forth a horrifying roar of rage. The other dragons answered the roar in unison drowning out the words coming from the child's quivering lips. Sensing the girl's weakness the beast lowered his head for the kill. Then to the wyrmm's utter dismay the child stood up laughing! 
Shaking the grass from her clothes the woman child smoothed her skirts and skipped over to the group of people standing together not far away. </p>

<p align=left>"Me don't think him like apples. Him went 'phewie' and spitted it out on the ground. See…" Mary said holding up a very singed apple for all to see. </p>

<p align=left>"Him smelleded me too and him s'obbered on me too…but me don't mind if him s'obber on me cause him prolly dinna mean to or nuthin. Me not mad cause him s'obber on me. Me still like him cause me think him is so boootiful but him do kinda s'obbers a lot tho. See…" Mary smiled holding out her arm which is dripping with saliva and smells strongly of sulfur and brimstone. </p>

<p align=left>A beautiful woman dressed in black armor with flaming red hair glared at Mary in disgust. "They don't eat apples you half-wit dragons are carnivorous." The woman hissed. </p>

<p align=left>Mary crinkled her forehead drawing her delicate brows together perplexed. "Huh? What you say? Why you say me that? Me don't 'stand them big words. Why for you use them big words pretty lady? You is really smart huh?" </p>

<p align=left>The red-haired woman shook her head in disbelief ignoring the girl's endless parade of questions. "I hate children." She muttered under her breath.</p>

<p align=left>"She means dragons only eat meat Mary." A lovely blonde woman replied. </p>

<p align=left>Mary smiled sweetly at the blonde woman. "Oh, me 'stand now. Thank you pretty lady Man. Me likes you pets a whole bunch. They is the bestest ones me ever s'eed afore." Mary said.</p>

<p align=left>"I am glad you like them Mary. I think they like you too." Mandy replied rolling her eyes nauseous almost gagging on her words. </p>

<p align=left>"You is lucky you has so many pets. Me can only has one pet cause momma says we don't habe the room. You must habe a really BIG house huh? Do's they s'eep with you? Sumtimes my doggie s'eeps with me but him don't smell so good tho. But him is the bestest watch dog cause him name is Ben. That means him is the bestest one…" Mary prattled. </p>

<p align=left>Mandy looked over at Mara Jade shaking her head exhausted with the pretense. Both women hated the girl Mary and neither of them could fathom their master's fascination with her. </p>

<p align=left>"Why don't you go stick your head in his mouth Mary? I bet he would like that game." Mara Jade said smiling wickedly. </p>

<p align=left>Mary's eyes lit with glee. "You think so?" She beamed. </p>

<p align=left>"Oh yes." Mara nodded reassuringly. </p>

<p align=left>"Ok, me will." Mary said walking off towards a large red dragon smiling. </p>

<hr width=600 align=center color="#24090E">

<p align=left>Smogg Azalin the leader of the Cult of Necromancy grabbed Mara Jade unceremoniously by the arm and led her away from the girl child Mary. </p>

<p align=left>"Mara do not make me tell you again to be nice to the woman child. I have plans for her. I have taken her under my wing and she promises to be my most apt pupil. Her young mind is easily manipulated and for now she serves my purpose eloquently. Do not interfere for thy shall surly feel my wrath." Smogg threatened. </p>

<p align=left>"But master she is…" Mara started to protest.</p>

<p align=left>Smogg raised a hand silencing the woman in mid sentence. </p>

<p align=left>"No buts. I know full well what she is. She is extraordinary. Just think of it Mara. Mary is a vicious serial killer with the heart and mind of an innocent child. She is loved the world over by villains and heroes alike. He who controls the child wields an awesome weapon. An assassin in the guise of an angel. Think of the possibilities." Smogg Azalin smiled with such vileness the woman next to him shuttered in fear. A silent nod was her only response. </p>

<hr width=600 align=center color="#24090E">

<p align=left>Mary walked up to the large red dragon laughing and smiling in her usual way. The dragon most unaccustomed to being approached by strangers just stood staring in disbelief with its huge mouth hanging open. Mary scrambled up one of the dragon's huge legs attempting to put her head in its open maw. The dragon refusing to suffer further indignation at the hands of the child reared back roaring in fury. Mary was thrown to the ground once again. </p>

<p align=left>The girl landed a few feet away with an audible thump. After a moment of dazed silence the child rose slowly to her feet rubbing her bruised posterior. </p>

<p align=left>"Him roareded. Did you hear him roareded?" She asked pointing at the dragon smiling. </p>

<p align=left>"Yes Mary, we all heard him roar." Smogg replied coming to stand beside her. "I think it would be best to let the dragons alone for now child. Why don't you do me an enormous favor and count them all for me. You like to count do you not?" Smogg asked. </p>

<p align=left>"Yep yep. Me can count bestest. Wanna see?" Mary turned and pointed at the first dragon in the circle. "One…two…three… six…ten…eighteen…'leven…"</p>

<p align=left>Mary walked around the circle mindlessly counting the same dragon on multiple occasions. Smogg nodded with satisfaction grateful for at least a momentary distraction. Turning his attention once again to his necromantic followers he was surprised to see a lone rider approaching from the North. Even from this distance it was obvious the man was a high-ranking nobleman for his silver armor glistened brilliantly in the morning sunlight. </p>

<p align=left>The stranger stopped outside the circle of beasts and dismounted bowing gracefully to the ladies and Smogg Azalin. </p>

<p align=left>"Hail good sir and ladies!" The man shouted to be heard over the dragons' roars. Smogg nodded in response. "Perhaps you can help me. I am late for a wedding reception supposedly being held in this vicinity." The stranger smiled warmly. </p>

<p align=left>Smogg returned the smile walking over placing a hand on Mary's shoulder he whispered something to the child which made her eyes sparkle with delight and nod her head vigorously. </p>

<p align=left>"Yep yep, Mr. Mog. Me want to see the drag'uns play. Me do me really do." Said Mary clapping her hands wildly. </p>

<p align=left>The stranger looked at the young woman a broad smile still on his handsome face. Then he saw Smogg Azalin's wickedness and the blood froze cold in his veins. The look of hatred on the necromancer's face could not be masked. </p>

<p align=left>"Mara, Mandy, Anna release the beasts. 'Tis time to play." Smogg commanded. </p>

<p align=left>The stranger turned in terror and ran for his mount. "WAIT! WAIT! You have no idea who I am." The man screamed as he grabbed the reigns and spurred his horse to a full run with a herd of dragons in hot pursuit. The man's screams could still be heard as he disappeared from sight.</p>

<p align=left>"But... I am LORD B-R-I-T-I-S-H…"</p>

<p align=left>Mary laughed jumping up and down her eyes shining with child like innocence. </p>

<p align=left>"They is habing sum fun now! Did you see how fast him run? Him is really fast huh? Me don't think they can catch him…nuh uh. Him is the fastest one me ever s'eed." Mary slapped her knee still giggling hysterically. </p>

<p align=left>Smogg turned to Mary smiling as sweet and loving as a father to his child. </p>

<p align=left>"He is very fast indeed Mary. Now whom shall we take the dragons to play with next? You decide. Do you have some friends who would like to play today?" Smogg asked sinisterly. </p>

<p align=left>"Me know! Me know! Me know where to go." Mary laughed happily thinking of all her friends that they could visit today.</p>
