<p align=left><b>Drifting</b><br><i>by XoR, as told by Tasslehof</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Tasslehof sat on the steps of the House of the Architects this night, listening
to the crickets singing thier rowdy song and the wind gently whispering through
the massive Yew trees on the outskirts of the village. Looking up he stared at
the stars that shone so brightly in the deep darkness that was the sky in these
parts and started to remember other nights when he had seen that sky and
listened to those sounds. He had been on this world a very long time from the
coming of the Order back to the lands of Britannia to now..oh so many years
later and as he sat his mind started to slowly drift back to the beginning...</p>

<p align=left>He remembered the first day of thier return to the lands...he had awoke cold and
hungry and lacking all of the many skills he had once had, but at least he had
arrived in Vesper where he was supposed to meet the rest of those returning. He
picked himself up off the ground and headed for the nearest Inn as that was the
most likely point to meet Brimstone and Freejack and the rest of his brethren.
On his way he started to notice how fresh and new everything smelled even though
it looked as if these people and these buildings had been here for quite some
time.  The grass was a deep shade of emerald green and smelled as if a light
spring rain had just fallen, making it seem as if Mother Nature herself walked
the land beside him. There, coming up in the distance, was the Inn with its
trademark torches dancing merrily in the breeze and the sound of laughter and
tall tales drifting out of its open door.</p>

<p align=left>Tas walked in the Inn and several people looked up and then looked again in
confusion, for what they saw at first was a fresh-faced farmboy. Until they
looked at the eyes. Eyes a deep forest green that seemed as if they carried the
wisdom of an ancient. Two pairs of eyes though did not look surprised but rather
pleased for though they were of a different color yet they carried the same air
of experience. Tasslehof saw them in the back of the room but a moment after
they had spotted him and recognition dawned upon him at the same time as a small
impish grin. He made his way back to the corner where they sat and greeted them.
"Hail Brothers. Damn tis good to see a familiar face in here Brewman..and you as
well Ghoti. Any word from the others yet?"</p>

<p align=left>Brewman gave a slight negative shake of his head while Ghoti replied " Nay not
yet, though we expect them any moment. To be honest we have not been sure who
made it through the crossover and who didn't, but if someone had not made it
then I think we would have felt thier demise. I do know that not everyone made
it here to Britannia but they have not passed on. I rather think that they might
have crossed into some other world."  "They have ," Brewman said...and would say
no more. "Brew...old friend...you have REALLY got to talk a little more...we are
going to need to communicate here if we are to return ourselves to our former
state" Ghoti snorted.</p>

<p align=left>"While we wait for Brimstone and Freejack perhaps you and I should go out and
see how the land lays Ghoti." Tasslehof said." Brew here would be the best one
to wait for them as I really don't want a repeat of the Last Inn I was in.
Although that WAS rather fun." "OH NO, I QUITE agree with that Tass, you barely
escaped alive the last time you spent any time in a place with people. And we
had one Devil of a tab to pay in damages. Not too mention the the healer bill
for you." Ghoti snorted. Tasslehof replied, "Whoah hang on there..it was NOT my
fault that fellow couldn't take a little joke. And I have no idea whatsoever how
that Blade Spirit got loose or where are those blasted ruffians came from. That
whole mess was not my fault, how was I to know he was the local warlord?"</p>

<p align=left>"All the same," Ghoti said, " you are going to stick with me for a while. I
really don't think you are in any shape yet to be running off on your own. Or
have you not noticed that we no longer carry the power and skills we once had?"
"Aye I noticed" was Tasslehof's reply, "maybe we can find someone to retrain us
or perhaps gather some gossip in the local merchants quarters." "I will wait
here," Brewman quietly stated. "Great! We are all settled then. Come on Ghoti,
lets go see the sites, " Tas grinned.</p>

<p align=left>Ghoti and Tasslehof took their leave of Brewman and started for the door with
Ghoti very much relieved that he was getting Tass the heck out of there without
having to fight his way out. He always did prefer to talk his way out of a place
than fight his way out, but Tass had trouble with a capital T follow him
everywhere he went. On the good side of that though it definately kept him on
his toes.</p>

<p align=left>Tasslehof and Ghoti walked around the corner of the Inn on thier way to the
merchant quarter where they hoped to purchase a few weapons and some magical
implements in preperation for the long arduous journey back to power ahead of
them. They passed a shadow at the back of the Inn when a strong pair of hands
grabbed Tasslehof and yanked him into the shadows. A second pair of hands
holding a bow guided Ghoti into the same area and both of them had those hands
placed on their mouths. "Quiet" , hissed a voice.</p>

<p align=left>"Ghoti how many did he get after you this time? And where are the rest of the
Council?" the other voice quietly asked. "He didn't have time for his curse to
work this time" Ghoti replied and asked " Carnifex is that you?" "Aye and
Ralineth with me," Carnifex sighed. " I had thought for sure we were doomed to
be chased before we even got everyone together. " "Brewman is in the Inn, " said
Tas. "He is as quiet here as he was back in the last realm. We have not found
Brimstone and Freejack yet though I am sure the Shard and the Tome are
protecting them. No word yet from Avenger or Zari yet either. " "Ok" , said
Ralineth, " I will go stay with Brew while the three of you scout the city and
look for the rest of the group. It will take at Least two of us to keep Tass
here from bringing down some type of trouble on us."</p>

<p align=left>Ralineth walked quietly back toward the front of the Inn while Carnifex fell
into place on the other side of Tasslehof. Once again on thier way to scout out
the rhythms of the city. Tasslehof perked up when they passed a shop with the
distinctive smell of hot metal being forged with a house right next to it that
carried the sounds of dummies being pounded upon. "Hey you two, we DO need to
start building our fighting skills again and gain some sort of protection. Why
don't we visit the Smith's shop and then go over for a little practice on the
dummies??" Tass said with a smile.  "Oh no you don't," Carnifex replied. "We
don't do any of that until we find the people we are missing and sniff out a
little more knowledge about how the land lies." "Agreed," said Ghoti, " that is
our first priority."</p>

<p align=left>"Hmmm" Carnifex muttered. " I would almost bet that we can find Brimstone in the
nearest Tailor shop getting outfitted with something a little more decent to
look at than these rags we all appeared here in. Why don't we go there first and
look for him and see if there is a bowyer along the way where we might find
Freejack. And I KNOW we will find Zari in the nearest shop selling magical
items." "And Tass," Carnifex growled. "This time you are NOT going in the mage
shops. Let me know what you need and I will try to find it. I don't want you
getting fried by a fireball or something before we have even been here a day."
"Carnifex I TOLD you that little mishap was not my fault, I DID NOT make those
ogre mages attack the place. It happened all on its own and you know it." "Yeah
but considering that there had not been an ogre mage even seen within a thousand
MILES of the place until you walked in, I don't think that they believed that."
said Ghoti with a raised eyebrow. "It was still not my fault" Tas explained.
Ghoti and Carnifex just looked at each other and sighed. Tasslehof could bring
down a flood in a desert.</p>

<p align=left>Carnifex, Tasslehof, and Ghoti proceeded to make thier way to the Tailor shop,
stopping here and there to ask directions and to listen to the rumors and gossip
that always float around the streets of a town the size of Vesper. When they
finally arrived, Carnifex and Ghoti almost ran Tasslehof over as just inside the
door he fell to the floor and started laughing uncontrollably. "What in the
world is so funny?" Ghoti asked. Tasslehof could merely point and continue
laughing at the frowning object of his laughter. Carnifex and Ghoti looked over
to the place Tasslehof was pointing and saw Brimstone wearing a tall garish
blue  hat with a buckle on its frontand  with a long flowing sly-blue cape and
thigh high black leathern boots to complement it.</p>

<p align=left>When Tasslehof could stop laughing long enough he said, "Brimstone...that is the
FUNNIEST hat I have EVER SEEN. I don't know..(giggling) maybe it is just I am so
used to seeing you in those serious robes of yours with the long serious beard
and all."  "Although," Tass said thoughtfully, " you WERE able to keep a meal or
two in that beard of yours just from the crumbs when you ate." Tasslehof then
once again fell to the floor laughing like there were no tomorrow.</p>

<p align=left>"Greetings everyone. I see Tass made the journey over without losing any of his
charming "humor", " Brimstone sighed. "Any word on the rest of the group?" he
asked Carnifex. "Brewman and Ralineth are waiting in the Inn for us and we were
about to go looking for Zari and Freejack and Avenger after we stopped here."
was Carnifex's reply. "No need on two of those counts", said a soft voice behind
them. The group turned to see Zari and Avenger standing behind them with slight
grins on their faces. "I don't see the town burning down yet or a massive army
of murderers or monsters attacking yet so I assume Tass has not been here long,"
grinned Avenger. "Don't give him any ideas Avenger," said a strong voice from
the doorway. "It is bad enough trouble follows him around without you helping it
along" said the voice of Freejack.</p>

<p align=left>"I can agree with that mate" grinned Ralineth, entering the shop with Brewman
on his right. "Freejack found us at the Inn just a while after you three left"
said Ralineth. "Se we decided to come looking for you." "It is so good to have
us all together again," Tass said with a huge grin on his face. "Now we can
start having some FUN!!"</p>

<p align=left>Everyone in the group sighed and looked at each other wondering who was going to
keep Tass out of trouble till they could get established again. None of them
really wanting the job...though they would do anything for him as they knew he
would for them. Indeed to be fair Tass had bailed each of them out of dire
straits before as well.</p>

<p align=left>"So be it then," Brimstone stated. "Everyone gather what they will need and meet
back at the Inn. That will be our headquarters for now. Once you have those
things you require meet me back there and we will begin our quest of bringing
light back to this land." "It is time brothers and sisters," Brimstones voice
started to gain power and majesty, "It is time once more for the Lost Order of
Akalabeth to walk the lands of Britannia. And WOE to those of evil intent that
stand in our way."</p>

<p align=left>Drifting....drifting....</p>

<p align=left>Tasslehof slowly brought himself back from the reverie of the past to see the
sun starting to come up over the trees and the birds singing softly in the
distance. While guardians started their patrols and the merchants chatted with
thier vendors about the days business Tasslehof noticed the aches and pains that
came with his long years upon the realm and he raised his now-silver-maned head
to look around and see how far they had come in thier quest to return to what
they once were in this realm.</p>

<p align=left>And he was Proud.</p>
