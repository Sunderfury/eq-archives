<p align=left><b>Come The Watchmen, Part III</b><br><i>by GrimJack</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The sun was setting over the Isle of Tears as they arrived in Cragstone. They hoped that Tasslehoff was still around and had yet to go off hunting or made his way to the Inn for the night as they hurried to the provisioner’s shop. Tasslehoff was upstairs, marking through some papers as they entered.</p>

<p align=left>“Ah! There ye be!” Tasslehoff’s face was an eclectic mix of happiness and apprehension: glad to see them but wondering what the news would be.</p>

<p align=left>Vizier immediately dropped to one knee as the other stared at him blankly. Tasslehoff looked puzzled before asking the question that they all feared.</p>

<p align=left>“Where is Zimmer?”</p>

<p align=left>Grimjack looked at the floorboards, hoping that if he didn’t look, he wouldn’t be asked.</p>

<p align=left>“Dead.” The voice was Dalmar’s, all of his anger and emotion from the morning was gone; internalized to use as fuel for when he needed it.</p>

<p align=left>“I’m terribly sorry to hear that, Dalmar.” Tasslehoff appeared to be genuinely upset by the news. “Your brother was a credit to your family.”</p>

<p align=left>Dalmar simply nodded once.</p>

<p align=left>“Beggin’ yer pardon, Tass…but how do you two know each other?”</p>

<p align=left>“Grimjack, It was Dalmar’s idea to send Zimmer on this little mission of mine since he was busy with business in Hebian-To at the time. I see it has ended badly for everyone involved. Now I must tell you the parameters of the mission and give you a new charter. Zimmer was to carry a near exact replica of the Tome and Shard from here to Rithwic. I felt sure that if he was close to Cragstone, then we could help him if he ran into trouble. He was only to go to Rithwic and back; bait for our currently unknown enemy.”</p>

<p align=left>“Enemy?” Grimjack began to whisper the names of bar wenches across Dereth.</p>

<p align=left>“Our enemy has, in their time here in Dereth, managed to find a way to control the monougas. They mean to rule them and use them as armies to drive us from our homes. In threatening letters, they even claim to have a way to close the portals from Ispar. With that done, they will be able to outnumber and destroy the entire populace, leaving Dereth in their hands. To do this he needs the Shard of Light and information that exists only in the Oracular Tome. For some time The Solf, Kelsam and Karas-Zan have been working to thwart his plans, but this enemy is gaining in power every day and their influence has spread beyond the lands of Eastern Osteth.”</p>

<p align=left>“I am hereby granting you a charter to form The Watchmen, Grimjack. You will be the “Royal Guard” if you will. It will be you two that will guard the safety of the Tome and Shard…and me as well. The fate of Dereth is in your hand gentlemen. Dalmar, you and this smelly fellow are free to leave, you have no more obligations here.”</p>

<p align=left>“Aww…. I know these two; they leave lots of dead around. I’ll be a real helper if’n ye don’t mind Tasslehoff.” Grimjack looked sideways at Cyvreaux, hoping that Tass would refuse. His eyes focused on Tasslehoff, hoping that the unspoken pleading would help his cause.</p>

<p align=left>“It would be an honor to have ye among them; but I need to know yer name!” Tasslehoff’s grin was pure mischief.</p>

<p align=left>“I’m Cyvreaux, defender of the meek, surveyor of the dead!”</p>

<p align=left>“I am staying as well.” Dalmar’s voice was again flat and devoid of emotion. Grimjack wondered when that buried emotion would come roaring to the surface and damn them all.</p>

<p align=left>Tasslehoff sighed. “Suit yerselves. Now go find me some evidence that I can use to convince the other monarchs that this threat is real!”</p>

<p align=left>“And may you walk in the light…”</p>
