<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Dozens of tiny yellow
motes of light surrounded Rothan as he murmured the words of his spell. A series of simple
gestures followed, and suddenly the lights coalesced into a yellowish fire on the floor of
the old, abandoned temple. The shivering travelers hastily drew near the fire, warming
their hands and faces.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Magical
fire,&quot; said Rothan, &quot;but warm nevertheless.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Warm enough for
me,&quot; said Greyhawk. &quot;It would have taken me much longer to build a
campfire.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;The art of
Conjuring does have its advantages,&quot; said the mage. &quot;On the other hand, one
often has to endure the whining of irritable elementals.&quot; He glanced toward the
entrance, where his familiar stood watch, no doubt grumbling to himself even now about the
cruelty of his master.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;What brings you
to Everfrost?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Rothan glanced at
Eshay. &quot;Well, it&#146;s a long story.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It&#146;s going
to be a long night.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Funny how you
put that,&quot; said Eshay. &quot;Greyhawk, have you ever heard the Legend of Night?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk nodded.
&quot;It&#146;s an oft-told tale among my people.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Could you tell
it to us?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;If you
wish,&quot; said Greyhawk. He cleared his throat.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0"><br>
&quot;Long ago, when the world was young, there was no such thing as night. The sun was
always shining, and the skies were never dark.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That was before
the arrival of Veeshan, the father of all dragons. So great was his size that his wings
covered the sky, and our world was plunged into darkness.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;The spirits of
the world cowered in fear, for they did not know what had happened, nor did they know what
to do. Without the gift of sunlight, the world would surely die.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Among their
number was a tiny hawk, a creature of light and shadow. &#145;I will fly up and see what
has happened&#146;, he said.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;So he soared up
into the air until he touched the very wing of Veeshan himself. With a mighty effort, he
pierced the wings of the great dragon with his claws until he became weary, and fell from
the sky.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Time and time
again, he flew up and attacked. Time and time again, he fell to the earth, only to fly up
again. Finally, after days and days, he managed to sever the dragon&#146;s wing.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Veeshan roared
in pain, a roar that was heard all over the land. The dragon flew away from our world,
leaving its broken wing behind.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That wing still
covers part of our world. As Norrath spins, the wing sometimes comes between us and the
sun, and that is why we have night and day.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;But at night,
you can see stars in the sky. Those stars are the holes that were made by the claws of a
tiny hawk whose bravery saved this world from eternal darkness.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0"><br>
&quot;A good tale,&quot; said Eshay.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;But there is
more to it,&quot; said Rothan. &quot;Lately, there have been dark rumors. All across the
land, in every city and town, the people are frightened. Priests are foretelling the end
of the world. Scholars and mages predict that some great catastrophe is drawing near. Some
say that Veeshan will soon return to this world, seeking vengeance.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It is also said
that, from among the people, one will be chosen,&quot; said Eshay. &quot;In the final
battle, there will be a chance, a single chance, for that person to save us.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;And you think
that person is me?&quot; asked Greyhawk.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Perhaps,&quot;
said Rothan. &quot;What little we know, we know only from legends. What do you say,
Greyhawk? Hawk of light and shadow? Will you help us to save the world?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk frowned.
&quot;The hawk in the legend is tiny. I am not tiny.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That
depends,&quot; said Eshay. &quot;We&#146;ll see how you compare when Veeshan
arrives.&quot;</font></font></p>
