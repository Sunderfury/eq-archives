<p align=left><b>Sally Makes Money the "Honest" Way</b><br><i>by Sally</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Jared my love,</p>

<p align=left>I just wanted to let you know that I have made me first bit of gold as a “honest” lady. As you might have heard I have been having a bit of trouble learning me new skill of sewing. Lady Sarah suggested that I go into the town of Yew and see if the kind Widow Harris would take me in as a student just as she had Lady Sarah so many years ago. I went to the kind Widow Harris’s little cottage just north of Yew. And just as Sarah said the kind widow took me in as her student.</p>

<p align=left>The Widow Harris is a very proper lady she is…but I am afraid she may not be in the best health. When she opened the door and saw me standing there her eyes got wide and she looked a bit pale. I told her that Lady Sarah had referred me to become her student…she just started fanning and muttering something that sounded like what I hear the priest say when I walk by them at the Abbey. After she sat down and got a glass of water she smiled at me and said that “tis noble to mend your ways like this and I will be more than happy to assist thee child”. So we started my lessons.</p>

<p align=left>We worked very hard that first day….nearly 12 hours and finally I made a sash..er..sort of. It was hard work and the kind Widow Harris kept running into her kitchen for her bottle of cooking sherry for her sauce (funny I never actually smelled anything cooking). The whole time I was there the kind Widow Harris must have crossed herself a hundred times or more and keep looking up towards her roof asking “why…what have I done to deserve this “. I had to wake the poor Widow Harris to let her know I was leaving for the day. She smiles and said “Saints be praised”. I smiled back and said that I would see her in the morning and her face changed suddenly and she slammed the door.</p>

<p align=left>Early the next morning I arrived at the kind Widow Harris’s home and knocked on the door. The widow came to the door and only opened to door wide enough to hand me a bag of gold. She said “Take this and never come back here…you have learned all that I can teach you”. I took the gold and she slammed the door again.</p>

<p align=left>So you see love… I have me a new skill and I have made some money in an honest way. It is only a matter of time love before I become a proper lady and we can be together.</p>
