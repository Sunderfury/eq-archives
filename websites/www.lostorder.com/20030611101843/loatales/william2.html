<p align=left><b>Journal of a Scholar Part II</b><br><i>by Friar William</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I felt better after a good nights sleep at the abbey and I decided I would take a walk in the vast woods of Yew. The mourning dew covered the forest with a satin layer as most creatures began to appear. This peacefull scenery turned grim with the blink of an eye as I noticed I was being followed. After turning back and confronting this msterious person it appeared he was Lieutenant Sunwolf of the Yew Militia. He was very cordial and helpfull, he even voluntered to escort me to the Yew University when he learned I was searching for a certain book. I gladly excepted and we were on our way. The good Lieutenant led on through seemingly endless paths and clearings, always keeping a watchfull eye at the surroundings. Aparently I was talking to a high ranking officer of this Militia since he already heared about myself and my research...blasted barkeep must have said something to a customer. </p>

<p align=left>After a long journey we arrived at the Yew University. The first stop, the main structure, had some bookshelves with some minor interesting books. For weeks now I've been deadlocked in my research and still no light at the end of the tunnel. Noticing my first disappointment he led the way to the Mage's resort and scriptorium of the University. Again nothing of any interest untill I noticed a strange whirlpool of sparkles behind a counter. I took my lookingglasses for a better look and by the Gods I swear it were microrifts cought in a perpetual vortex. The Rifts were raw and chaotic, but with the proper knowledge this could prove a vital piece of information for my research. </p>

<p align=left>By this time a small group of adventurers were upon me, all questoinning with little tact and respect for my old age. To tell you the truth I felt abit at unease with this crowd around me and I think I gave them more informaion then they deserved. I told them I knew the Tome of Making was last known to belong to a wizard residing on Fire Island. And I surely shouldn't have said that very wizard was last seen around Wrong. Ah well, atleast I didn't reveal that the wizard was researching ways to reach immortality through rebirth after death. Some weird pact with sinister evil forces. </p>

<p align=left>At this moment there was some excitement, a man named Smogg Azalin stood outside. Being a good scholar I had heared of Smogg before, a most potent scholar himself, were it not for the fact he turned to the Dark Side. After that things moved fast, some brave men went outside to confront Smogg and distract him as I slipped out the shack and to the best of my ability ran through the woods... </p>

<p align=left>After that the world turned black.... oh my poor fragile body... must rest.... must stop.....</p>
