<p align=left><b>A Pirate in Gentleman's Clothing</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>“I look bloody ridiculous,” muttered Santiago, staring into a full-length mirror and fidgeting with the wide brim of his hat for the hundredth time.</p>

<p align=left>Red Tom smirked and watched as the servants scurried and scuttled about, orbiting the young pirate like a swarm of angry bees. “Ridiculous isn’t the word,” said the rogue, struggling to contain his laughter. “You look downright…gentlemanly!”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago swore colorfully and threw his fancy hat on the floor. “That does it! I ain’t goin’ through with this.”</p>

<p align=left>“You’ve got no choice,” said Tom, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms behind his back. “This is the best way for you to find your killer, and you know it.”</p>

<p align=left>“Why can’t I just dress like a pirate?”</p>

<p align=left>“Because you ARE a pirate, Santi. A pirate that everyone is looking for. You need a disguise…something that makes you appear as something you aren’t. And you certainly aren’t a gentleman.”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye, ye said the truth. So how am I s’posed to go an’ act like one? They’ll sniff me out like a dead fish in July!”</p>

<p align=left>“You’ll do fine. Just don’t say anything unless you have to, don’t belch or scratch your armpits, and for heaven’s sake, don’t get yourself drunk!”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago grimaced. “Thar’s a source o’ hardship if ever I heard one. Are they almost done?”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye, that ought to just about do it.” The servants withdrew, and Tom stepped forward to inspect their handiwork. “Not bad at all,” he said, adjusting the grey sash by a fraction. “You actually clean up fairly well, Santi...though I never thought I’d see it. But listen to me…you have to be careful tonight. Even if you come face to face with the murderer, you can’t just draw steel and run him through. You were lucky at the Keg and Anchor last night, but luck has a way of running dry if you keep relying upon it. So keep your wits about you, all right?”</p>

<p align=left>“Awright.” Santiago shook the hand of his former friend and enemy. “I owe ye one, matey.”</p>

<p align=left>“You owe me several. Just make sure you live long enough to even the score.”</p>

<p align=left>Red Tom watched from a window as Santiago made his way from the alley out into the street. Though few people knew about his private home here on the east side, he didn’t want to take any chances. He had instructed two of his men to follow Santiago, to make sure that no harm came to him. But what happened to the pirate after he reached his destination was beyond his control. Santiago was young and reckless, and up until now he had always managed to land on his feet. But some day – and he suspected it would be some day soon – he would get caught on the wrong side of risk.</p>

<p align=left>“There’s a large bounty on that pirate’s head, milord,” came a voice from the darkness. “It would be a lot of money if we turned him in.”</p>

<p align=left>Red Tom did not turn to address his chief assassin, but instead kept his eyes on the shadowy street below. “It’s only gold,” he said quietly. “Gold never weighs as much as honor.”</p>
