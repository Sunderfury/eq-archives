<p align=left><b>Captain's Log: The Plague!</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It’s the cold months what hold the meanest eye toward us mortals. Not two weeks into the new year, an’ already folks is droppin’ left an’ right. Everywhar ye go, all ye hear is coughin’ an’ sneezin’. Thar’s no two ways about it – the Plague is upon us.</p>

<p align=left>An’ now it's upon me, as well. I’ll lay gold to it that every body in that brothel was fightin’ it off. I should o’ known I was in trouble when I heard me darlin’ Julia fire off a cough or two. But thar’s sometimes when the night is too cold an’ dark to spend it alone, an’ all ye want is a warm woman to hold, consequences be darn’d.</p>

<p align=left>So now me throat is sore; I can almost feel the evil little buggers tryin’ to crawl their way in an’ make me sick. It’s a battle I can’t win, a battle whar me blade won’t do no good. Thar’s only one course to set; I’ll sail up to the Abbey an’ find a healer to set this afflicted soul on the path to betterment.</p>

<p align=left>So I’m walkin’ along the ol’ forest road, when all of a sudden I hear the sound o’ gallopin’ hooves up ahead. An’ what do ye s’pose I saw? Well, it weren’t nothin’ short o’ the Grim Reaper ‘imself! All dressed in white like a ghost, a skeletal face glarin’ at me. Well, I just knew I was gonna kick the bucket. So I run fer me life (literally) an’ jump into the Moongate. Luck be with me, fer I found meself surrounded by the familiar trees o’ Yew, an’ Death was nowhar to be seen.</p>

<p align=left>And then when I got to the village…thar he was again! Death sure does travel awful fast, thar’s what I was thinkin’. But as it turns out, it weren’t Death at all – in fact, it were one o’ me own family, none other than the Lost Order! Well tie me up an’ throw me overboard, I never would o’ thought to see one of our Order dressed up like one o’ hell’s own. But I ain’t one to talk ‘bout fashion; heck, I been wearin’ the same skullcap fer more than a year now.</p>

<p align=left>Anyways, I shot the breeze with the folks thar fer a bit. Most of ‘em were busy tusslin’ about with demons an’ elementals, so I figgered I’d let ‘em be. I know I’m gettin’ old, ‘cause I can remember when thar used to be music an’ dancin’ an’ in that little spot o’ grass. Now the grass is stained red, an’ the music is ringin’ steel. It’s a tune I’ve heard b’fore, an’ I’ll confess I’m awful tired of it. But I s’pose it’s the only tune that some folks know.</p>

<p align=left>So it’s off to the Abbey, whar I met with a familiar face – Elrios! Turns out he’s officially signed on with the Fleet now. I had to ask him who the Admiral is now, seein’ as how I can’t keep it straight. Nearest we could figger, it was The Nameless One who’s at the helm right now. Elrios also told me a dark secret, but I don’t dare write it down, fer fear that other eyes mought somehow catch sight o’ these pages. I says to him that we oughtter set sail one o’ these days, to go on a pirate adventure. Look to it!</p>

<p align=left>An’ now they got me locked up here at the Abbey. Rest an’ sleep an’ clear liquids (well, some liquors is clear, no?). They say I’ll get better in time, but as I lay here restin’, all I can think ‘bout is me darlin’ Julia, an’ though we be leagues apart, thar ain’t much I wouldn’t give fer one more taste o’ them soft red lips. ‘Tis a diff’rent sort o’ plague, I s’pose, but it’s a heck of a lot better than the one I got.</p>
