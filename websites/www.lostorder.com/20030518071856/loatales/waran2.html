<p align=left><b>Neodar's Personal Diary</b><br><i>by Waran Rhinelander</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Well, after fighting many battles in Solusek last night, I've had a chance to relax (or try to for that matter) By sitting down by the cave entrance and try to fully understand what this "Neodar's diary" was all about. Thankfully I brought it with me.</p>

<p align=left>As I sit reading the tome, the heat and steam from the lava pits in Lavastorm cross my face. I've never experienced such an uncomfortable climate in me life. I wish I was back in Everfrost where I could be comfortable again.</p>

<p align=left>Reading through, I notice that Neodar is definately an ancestor. I see his teachings in me that my father taught me, as he explains fighting techniques on certain creatures that I too have fought in the past. The question I have is why in Norrath did he leave our home at such an early age. As he mentions, "I am not worried about such a long journey to Feydwer being of the 5th circle. I can handle anything!" 5th Circle!?!?! I was much older than that when Xirius and I made the trip so long ago. What was his driving force into such a long trip?</p>

<p align=left>Then I started to understand. It seems that Neodar had many visions of himself in Felwithe. He described them in such detail that I remember seeing every detail of his visions in my recent trip to Felwithe. With shivers down my spine I continued on.....Neodar had many multiple visions of a High Elf female that would always smile and wink at him as he walked through Felwithe. Love is such a powerful thing, I couldn't help thinking of my dear Azlana and how much I love her, and miss her and my girls as I read this.</p>

<p align=left>There is quite a bit of delay between journal entries, probably due to the quite dangerous trip he traveled at such a young age. The next entry is Neodar arriving in Freeport and the boat ride over. He is so excited that he made it across Antonica without any incidents. I'll include a snippet of his entry here:</p>

<p align=left><i>I am amazed that I have made it this far. As I gaze upon the sea, I look back to my vision and everything here is moving in unison to it...the sails of the boat, the people on the deck with me, even the birds look the same...Must be fate...it has to be fate. We are approaching the dock in Butcherblock, till my arrival in Felwithe... Neodar</i></p>

<p align=left>I'm surprised I've actually been reading this tome for the amount of time that I have. I must continue.....</p>

<p align=left>Here is how Neodar expresses what is going through his mind as he ventures through Butcherblock and Greater Feydark, as he gets closer and closer to his visions coming true..</p>

<p align=left><i>I can't believe that this is falling into place. I can all but hope that the one that has captured my heart is there waiting for me. Once I see her smiling face, I don't know what I'll do.....I can't believe I am close to the one who I have loved in my visions for these many years. The gates of Felwithe tower above me...I must enter....Neodar</i></p>

<p align=left>Neodar enters Felwithe and low and behold the love of his life was there standing, just as he had envisioned, and waiting for him. She smiled at him and gave him a wink. He begins to tell her about the visions that he was having for so many years, before he can continue, she simply says to Neodar..."I know darling, I know."</p>

<p align=left>Now I can understand why he left Halas. Certainly a Barbarian and High Elf relationship would not go over smoothly to the people of Halas in those times. Other than earlier posts prior to the last, all I can find is one more entry and what appears to be a wedding announcement. The last entry appears written very fast, like in a rush. </p>

<p align=left><i>We are leaving Felwithe for a brief excursion back to Everfrost, we yearn for adventure in our lives. Although not willing to accept our love for eachother at first, Alirana parents understand and love the both of us. I can all but hope my family will say the same...Alirana can't wait to see Everfrost, she says that she has always wanted to feel the cold Northern reaches of Antonica for herself. Very unusual for High Elves, but I love her just as she is....must be off</i></p>

<p align=left>Wait a minute, a High Elf that likes Cold?!?! This is very rare indeed. I need to rest, I am done reading and can barely see the text with my Greater Lightstone. I hope to discuss this with my friends tomorrow that arrive at Solusek. Till then, g'night from Lavastorm.</p>
