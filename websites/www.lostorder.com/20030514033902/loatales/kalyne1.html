<p align=left><b>Kalyne's Beginnings</b><br><i>by Kalyne, as told to Brigadyr</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It was a rather dismal and dreary day when Kalyne first arrived in Kelethin. The trees seemed to go on forever, and not a sliver of sky was there to be seen anywhere. When she asked a passing guard why one couldn't see the sky, he merely replied, "Sky? What is a 'sky'?" The rain had not stopped since she had entered this forest and, having forgotten her rain cloak, she was soaked right through. The elves here were of a friendly sort for the most part, although there were a few shady characters lurking about - swindling newcomers and the like. Kalyne asked a merchant by the name of Kwein where she might find the bank and the ranger's guild. He gave her directions, and she navigated the ramps and bridges until she found the bank. The banker, Willean, offered her a box in which she could keep her money and personal effects that she did not want to carry along. She gratefully accepted the offer, and once sure that the box was locked and put safely away, she headed for the ranger's guild: Faydark's Champions is what the merchant called it.</p>
<p align=left>Once there, Kalyne spoke with Maesyn Trueshot, the Ranger Guildmaster. He welcomed her into the Champions and gave her a tunic to wear to let all know of her affiliation with them. He also told her about the Trueshot Bow, and how one day she may have the skill to attain such a weapon. Kaylne then spoke with other trainers, learning of various tasks she could help them with, and perhaps getting something useful in return for her services. Once she had spoken with everyone and said farewell, she headed into the Greater Faydark to work on her skills and seek out some of the things the trainers were looking for.</p>
<p align=left>Kalyne soon discovered that her fighting and tracking skills were very rusty indeed. Bats and wasp drones almost got the better of her several times. Once in a while she would run across a decaying skeleton or orc pawn roaming the lands; her experience with the bats told her well enough that she was not ready to take on such foes at this point. The guards were always willing to lend a helping hand if things got a little sticky. Soon, Kalyne was finding wolf pelts that others had just left on the ground as well as some of the hatchets that Dill of the Ranger guild had wanted.</p>
<p align=left>Kalyne went back up into the city and sold some of the things she had found. Mostly bone chips, wings of sorts, and the occasional rusty weapon. She was headed to the bank when she heard a tailor shouting.<br><br>
"On sale! Today only! Bring me a wolf pelt and I will make ye armor for a gold!" the man said.<br>
Kalyne asked, "One gold? Would I be able to get 3 pieces of armor for 3 gold?"<br>
The man replied, "Of course you can, lass. Do ye have wolf pelts? Ah, good. Come in, then! We'll get started."<br>
Kalyne wandered around the man's shop, looking at all the different types of armor and clothing that were hanging on walls and in diplays.<br>
"Here ye go, lass," the tailor said. "I figured ye could use a tunic, some leggings, and some gloves. Wouldn't want the nasties down below to hurt ye, after all."<br>
"I appreciate this greatly," replied Kalyne. "I was wondering when I would be able to get something to protect me, and I had thought it would be farther off than this! If there is anything you should need, please let me know."<br>
The tailor smiled and said, "Aye, that I shall lass, that I shall. Well, I have a few more things to make. Safe travels and good hunting to you. And don't forget to see me if you need more armor!"<br>
"I won't forget, kind sir. Safe travels as well to you, and good fortune I might add! Farewell!"<br><br>
And with that, Kalyne waved to the tailor as she left his shop, and headed for the bank yet again. Once she had safely stored the little money she had gained, she walked in the direction of Faydark's Champions.</p>
