<p align=left><b> Journal - Day One</b><br><i>by Wyll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I must say, it was a great joy seeing some of my brothers again. Wyloon, Wumpus, Wyndelle, Wysll, the scoundral Wyxle and a friend of mine, Vojo, answered my message for help...the Walaryn clan has been scattered for too long.</p>

<p align=left>As exciting as the reunion was, it was bitter-sweet. We all knew this wasn't a happy gathering, there are serious matters to be dealt with. This prophecy is quite disturbing and we only know a bit more now than we did when we started out. Unfortunately, the visit with our dear uncle Wyndsor didn't prove very helpful. Though I love him dearly, he has grown quite cold over the years...perhaps because his nephews have left him to strike out on their own...or perhaps for other reasons...I don't know. </p>

<p align=left>Then Wyndsor had us search out the old hermit Wyzer. Now that was odd. Why would Wyndsor have us look for the town loon? Well, regardless, we did it anyway. We found the old man muttering to himself in the Steamfont. Out of no where he almost attacks us with his lunatic ravings...I didn't understand a whit of it and actually found him quite frightening...even if he is harmless. The things he said sent a shiver up my spine...all this talk of whirlwinds and fighting and "Darkest Walaryn"...I don't know what to make of it. </p>

<p align=left>As we left the old man told us to head for the stone bird. I didn't have a clue what he meant, but Wyloon seemed to know. He said he used to run to a statue in the Feydark when he was younger...perhaps to hide from Wyndsor...or maybe just to be alone, regardless, he offered to lead us there. </p>

<p align=left>Obviously, it had been a LONG time since Wyloon had gone this way. He kept mumbling about the path being gone or the shadows in the woods confusing him, whatever it was, it took an awful long time to find the statue...and the Feydark is no place to be lost in. Those woods give me the creeps and by Brell I swear they be cursed. </p>

<p align=left>While we were trying to figure out what this giant stone bird statue was supposed to do the strangest thing yet happened. I walked up on the statue alter hoping to find some indication of what we were supposed to do when I was suddenly wracked with the most violent pain I have ever known. I was completely unable to move, all my muscles were frozen in pain....and then I lots conciousness. When I came to my brothers told me that I had slipped into some kind of trance...speaking words that were not my own. Wyxle said I spoke of a West wind and champions riding forth. I don't remember any of it, perhaps one of my brothers was quick enough to write it down. </p>

<p align=left>Without anything else to go on we decided it best to seek out those who are wise and know of such things and therefore Felwithe was our destination. Once again, Wyloon managed to get us lost...I'm not so sure I'll trust him to guide us any longer....Wysll finally directed us into Greater Feydark. </p>

<p align=left>Upon arriving in Felwithe we decided it best to find an inn and get some rest before seeking answers to this prophecy. I complied wholeheartedly...my muscles still ache after what happened at the statue and the headache is still with me. </p>

<p align=left>Tomorrow I hope the wise ones of Felwithe can help us, we need answers for I fear this prophecy is more dire than we understand.</p>

<p align=left>I haven't gotten much sleep tonight...besides this throbbing headache I keep hear these voices in my head. After ignoring them for several hours I finally decided to write them down...here goes.</p>

<p align=left>The West wind blows and a new champion rides forth<br>
Dark of heart and cold of soul<br>
The Dark champion spreads an evil wind<br>
Unto the city of steam </p>

<p align=left>The East wind blows and a new champion rides forth<br>
Heart of Truth and soul of Light<br>
The champion of Light stands before the approaching darkness<br>
Surrounded by Shadow and Lies </p>

<p align=left>In the middle the Whirlwind forms<br>
A figure of chaos bound in the center<br>
Held in the grasp of the East and West winds<br>
Till a champion divides the storm </p>

<p align=left>Looking back over what I've written I can only imagine this is the prophecy I spoke at the stone bird statue...I have no idea what any of this means, but at least now I have something to show the wise ones here in Felwithe when we set out tomorrow. </p>

<p align=left>Now, maybe these voices will quiet themselves so I can get some rest!</p>
