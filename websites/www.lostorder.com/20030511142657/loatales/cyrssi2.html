<p align=left><b>Day Two</b><br><i>by Cyrssi</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Dear Elandel,</p>

<p align=left>I forgot to tell you in my last entry that I came into my 16th season last night while fighting the Devishes. Uncle Aanlain was very pleased, albeit a little tipsy. Uncle Perth was nowhere to be found, so hopefully he has found out by now. I sometimes wonder why I help support Uncle Aanlain's drinking habit. It just doesn't seem right for such a faithful druid to be stumbling about all the time. Oh well...</p>

<p align=left>Today I decided to do a bit of hiking and go to East Karanas. I passed many a person who needed my services, and I did not leave anyone in need. A few gave donations in the name of Tunare, which I silently accepted in your memory. The trek through the Kithicor Woods, Rivervale, and Misty Thicket were fairly uneventful. I made a quick stop in Rivervale and was almost driven insane from the music those halflings like to play. I just don't see the fascination.</p>

<p align=left>The goblins in RunnyEye knew better than to attack me, although someone did decide to run an Evil Eye (ugly nasty things with pets!) into me, causing me to retreat. Once the Eye had been disposed of, I made it through the Citadel and into the Gorge of King Xorbb. The hike through there was rather uneventful, although I got lost once and ended up going in a circle. After getting my bearings again, I made it safely to East Karanas.</p>

<p align=left>When I got there, I tried to remember what you had said we were going to hunt when we came here. I knew which creatures to avoid, so I commenced with attacking the chasm crawlers and anything else that decided it needed to attack me. I found a most interesting thing on a carrion spider...halfling parts. I took my spit out of my pack and proceeded to successfully make some Hot-n-Spicy Toelings. Not too bad...I think Uncle Aanlain will like them. </p>

<p align=left>I kept fighting and resting, and I occasionally helped someone in need if they asked. I had to make a trip back to Rivervale, and on my way back I saw Oudno, the paladin we had fought with in Oasis. I asked if he wanted to join me and he accepted. We made our way back to EK and continued what I had started earlier. We were able to take on a few gorge hounds in addition to the others, but it was always a close fight with the hounds.</p>

<p align=left>As the sun went down, Oudno had to leave. I bid him farewell, and I continued to fight for a little while. I am now halfway through my 16th season, and I'm looking forward to my 17th season. I wish you were here with me, but I know that cannot be. I can only hope that you fare well and that you will soon return. It is now getting late and I must rest. Take care.</p>

<p align=left>Goodnight, brother.</p>
