<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Twnety Two</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I had such a wonderful surprise when I got off the boat in Freeport. There was my golden one to greet me with in the way we have grown accustom to. I was so overjoyed to see him that I completely forgot to ask him how he knew I would be there. One of the guards at the warrior guild probably told him. </p>

<p align=left>He said he was there to escort me to High Pass since I had to go through the forest and he was concerned for my safety. I got a few supplies that I needed and then we were off. As we were entering the forest I asked him if we would be safe and he said he was not sure. That took me aback since he is always so sure of himself so I was greatly concerned. We got to the zone and he cast all his protective spells upon me and then he escorted me to the center of the pass where I bound myself. Sadly he had to leave shortly thereafter. Our visit was short but I will hold that memory in my mind of him being there when I got off the boat for a long time.</p>

<p align=left>After he left I began inquiring about a group and promptly got one. No sooner had I cast my protective spells upon the tanks than they began fighting. I tried to meditate as much as I could but there always seemed to be a creature upon me. They were too impatient and of course I died. While I was memorizing my spells they were talking of going to some place else. I told them I still did not have my belongings but they did not seem to care and were moving off without me. I thanked them for the grouping and told them go on with out me and I would find another group. Well, I did find another one and I had gained more experience in one night than I had in two weeks in Unrest. That was all well and good until the next day when I found another group. The orc side is mostly kill as fast as you can to get the kill and they wanted me to be a nuker. I tried but that is not my calling in life. I left that group.</p>

<p align=left>After some careful consideration I decided that this was not the place for me after all and I prepared myself for the travel through the forest. I did make it through at night and by daybreak I was in the commons and made my way to the Oasis. I was able to hunt with Vamarin and his friends for a short bit. </p>

<p align=left>I would think people would want a cleric that actually knew her duties. Ah well, perhaps some day. I found a nice spot by the water to camp. I think I will just sit here for a bit and meditate to clear my mind before going to sleep. </p>
