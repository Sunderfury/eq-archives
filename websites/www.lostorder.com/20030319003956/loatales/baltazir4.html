<p align=left><b>The Path of the Riddle</b><br><i>by Baltazir</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The Winds had been following him all day...for that is the way of the Winds. Though not of Sho heritage, he had been impressed with the Winds by his friend Kiyo-Jima. The Winds were hinting at a riddle of great magnitude that had been haunting him for days now. He tried to clear his mind by focusing on the shifting sands. It was his custom to do such when he needed to think. In doing this, the din of the Archmage Shop of Cragstone was put out of his mind. His hands were going through the motions of checking his spell component inventory and purchasing items he was of short supply. His mind was racing, however. He thought of the darkness of which the Phoenix warned. He thought of Compassion, of Humility, of Detachment, and of Discipline. "What do they have in common" he pondered while there in the Shop. A Word, and an offering, that was the riddle...</p>

<p align=left>While thinking and buying supplies he heard a familiar voice outside. It was his friend Kiyo speaking to another friend, Taishi Kirin. He quickly concluded his business and exited the Shop. It was more than coincidence that had put the three in such close contact. Again the Winds stirred inside his head. Once outside he noticed the darkness of evening settling in...and shivered at the thought of a prophetic darkness yet to come. He moved over and bowed to his friends, who in turn each bowed in greeting. It only took a few minutes before the conversation turned to the riddle...for Kiyo held the answer. The three quickly realized that the area was too abuzz with travelers to have a serious conversation so they moved down the hill to the beach.</p>

<p align=left>They seated themselves in a circle to talk...and to ponder the meaning of the riddle. He picked up a handful of sand and thought fondly of the deserts of his homeland. After watching the sand fall between his fingers he struck up a quiet conversation with Kiyo. He noticed that Taishi had done the same as they were both seeking to solve the riddle. The quiet conversation continued for a time, each reasoning with Kiyo to gain understanding. Finally, Kiyo spoke to Taishi and asked for his solution. Taishi whispered to Kiyo his answer and Kiyo nodded sagely. Kiyo then turned his attention to the Gharu'ndim. "I know that you are not a follower of Jojii, but do you have an answer friend?" The Winds swirled about him...and he focused on the shifting sands to clear his mind. He looked Kiyo in the eyes and whispered to him "I have thought of Compassion and Humility. Of Detachment and Discipline. And of Word and Offering. I believe that the answer lies within. I believe that to defeat the darkness it takes oneself. Therefore, I offer that the Word is Dedication and the offering is myself." Kiyo nodded and smiled broadly. He then spoke aloud to the others saying "I am honored by your responses friends. You two are like of mind and have offered the exact same solution." Looking stunned, he looked over at Taishi, and then at Kiyo. Kiyo went however went on saying "While the solution you two offered is sound, it is not however the correct answer. But, being so close of mind, and on the right path to the answer, I charge you both with working together to solve the riddle and to answer the Phoenix."</p>

<p align=left>At this point he stands and speaks to Kiyo and Taishi saying "I will do as you say my friend. I will visit the desert and search within myself. Then I shall return and discuss with friend Taishi those things I have learned."</p>

<p align=left>As he stood to depart, the Winds again swirled inside his head, hinting at possibilities to consider. He wished his friends safe journeys until they would meet again, bowed, and departed to focus on the shifting sands...</p>
