<blockquote>
<p align=left>My golden one came to me last night knowing I was so close to my next circle that he wanted to assure I would attain it as safely as possible. He cast so many spells upon me that I felt like a tank.</p>

<p align=left>He carefully brought to me undead making sure I would not die in the process. I have made progress on my own but in groups died a lot so I think he just didn't want to see it happen right now. I would sit an meditate in between and tried to talk with him but he just seemed so distracted that after awhile I gave up and decided to just enjoy the fact that we had gotten the chance to spend more than a few minutes together this day.</p>

<p align=left>He came out of the deep thought that he had been in to tell me that it was time to meet his mother. Oh my, something that I had wanted to do now is coming up so close. I had learned some things the past few days that I had wanted to write down but now my mind is so distracted that I can't just seem to bring all my thoughts together. </p>

<p align=left>His mother. He said that she had grown her beard back. Me with out one. What will she think? At least I have attained my next spells and maybe she won't think me too young for him. Oh my, what am I going to do? What am I going to say? He best not leave us alone because I will surely be tongue-tied. </p>

<p align=left>I need too walk around a bit to clear my mind. </p>
