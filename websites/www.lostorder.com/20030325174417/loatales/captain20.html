<p align=left><b>Captain's Log: Leafcull 12, 11 P.Y.</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It's been a full fortnight and the cold shows no signs of abating yet. I've
done some exploring around the Glenden Wood area looking fer a cause, a
rumor or at least a way I have help the locals keep warm and well fed. In
the last few weeks I've heard rumors that the snowmen we used to build as
children have become animated and are attacking the unwary traveler. Today
I verified those rumors for myself.</p>

<p align=left>I was exploring the areas just north and west of Glenden Wood today and at
the crest of a hill I found a snowman wielding a snowball. He lobbed the
thing at me, and though it didn't hurt, it was very unsettling. I took the
bugger down quite easily, but if even the snowmen are fighting humans now, I
worry as to what lurks in the north wilds and in the direlands.</p>

<p align=left>In my explorations I did not find much else, other than snow and the
occasional snowman. Though I did find an abandoned prison just north west
of town. Though humans have abandoned the place, a colony of mites has
taken up residence within.</p>

<p align=left>I would like to head back there some time soon with a larger force. The
mites that have taken to calling the old prison home are not featherweights
like their surface dwelling brethren. I have heard that before the place
was abandoned the last human residents stashed a pile of arms and armor
there. Though the drunkard that said such could have been referring to
another place in the area, it still would be worth checking into, if only to
clear out a pack of mites.</p>

<p align=left>After I found that prison I headed east and happened upon a farmer. The
poor mate was shiverin' in the cold and had already run out of food due to
the poor harvest. Well I didn't have much in the way of food fer him, but I
shared an ale and gave him a little pyreal to help him though the winter.
Must me a hard life fer the likes of him, with the weather as its been, and
a camp of mites not 2 miles from 'is home.</p>

<p align=left>After that I decied to head back into town myself and replenish my ale
supply. While I was warmin' me blood with a mug of Glenden Wood's fine
stout I over heard the bar tender talking about some expidition to the north
lands that has disappeared. Seems a Sir Joffre Tremblanitis lead a group of
adventures north to find the cause of the cold spell and they disappeared.
They left from the town of Arwic, which is a good two days travel from here.
Perhaps I'll head that way if the weather permits as well as put out word to
the Lost Order to meet there. Perhaps there is something that the combined
forces of the Shard and Tome can do to either find this lost party, or the
cause of the strange happenin's of late.</p>
