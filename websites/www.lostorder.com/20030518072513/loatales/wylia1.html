<p align=left><b>Enter Wylia...</b><br><i>by Wylia</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The sun was shining bright and there was not a raincloud to be seen. I sat in the cave, wondering what to do. I wasn't quite sure where to begin looking, and I knew that it may take a long time to find something that I had lost yet had never seen...my family.</p>

<p align=left>When I was younger, I was taken in by a gnomish couple who found me on their doorstep. They weren't quite sure what to make of it, but they cared for me as if I were one of their own. They, of course, had always wanted a child but could not seem to make that dream a reality. When I was found, it was like their prayers had been answered.</p>

<p align=left>I was brought up by the teachings of Brell. I was given anything I could ever need or want. I excelled in my normal schooling as well as in my religious schooling. As the time drew near to declare my life-intent, I knew what would make my parents most proud, and it was something that I had always hoped for. I was to become a Cleric.</p>

<p align=left>Many of my schoolmates laughed at me, thinking I was a goody two-shoes. All they ever did was show off their mere parlor tricks of creating little balls of light, causing people to stop breathing, reanimating a pile of rat-bones, or making a flame jump from their hand to a candle on the other side of the room. I wanted to be able to keep people alive and rid the world of the walking dead, as they bring chaos and mayhem wherever they roam. They can laugh all they want; it will be a different matter altogether when they have a need for my talents.</p>

<p align=left>My parents were thrilled that I was going to be a Cleric. They insisted that I begin my training as soon as possible, even though it would mean that I would need to leave home for days, even weeks, on end. They would always have a nice dinner ready for me when I did return home, and we would sit around the fire telling stories until the wee hours of the morning. I felt so loved and so content during those times.</p>

<p align=left>I only recently found out that they were not my natural parents.</p>

<p align=left>I haven't told them that I am looking for my natural parents and family...it would break their hearts. Instead, I decided to incorporate the search into my clerical training excursions. I think that it is still too soon after my departure for them to be detached enough to understand and not be upset with my decision. And I am sure they wouldn't want to know of the events that have recently transpired.</p>

<p align=left>It had been a long time since I had been to the grand gnomish city of Ak'Anon. I told myself that the only logical place to begin looking would be there. I could also get a bit of clerical training there and pick up supplies. I headed out of the cave and walked to the city, taking in all the scenery. One shady looking character stopped me on the road. I tried to scream for the guards, but he put his hand over my mouth and handed me a note. "Take this," he said. And that was it. He slid away into the shadows, and I opened the note. It read:</p>

<p align=left>"The beginnings of what you seek are in Ak'Anon. Many are there who can help. None know of you. Talk to an elder gnome. Wyndsor. He can help. Tell him that you suspect Wyxle. Now go."</p>

<p align=left>The city had changed a bit since my last visit, and I asked a guide for help in getting to the cleric guild. I figured that I would start off with what errands I needed to run in the city before beginning the search for this Wyndsor fellow. I wasn't sure that I wanted to find him. The guide gave precise directions, and I was off to the guild.</p>

<p align=left>A group of young male gnomes were sitting on the ground, listening to an older man. Every once in a while one of the younger ones would interrupt with a question, and the older gnome would reprimand the fellow and continue with his story. I didn't think much of it at first, and I went inside and saw the guildmaster. When my training was over, I went back outside. The gnomes were still there! One of them looked at me, and quickly looked away. I made it look like I was adjusting things in my pack while I watched him. He looked over again, as if he knew me from somewhere.</p>

<p align=left>The older gnome asked what the young one (Wyloon I think his name was) was looking at, and he pointed to me! The old one asked me my name, and I simply answered, "Wylia, sir." He asked me where my parents were, and I proceeded to tell him that I was in training as a cleric and my parents were far from the city, and that, in fact, I didn't know who my real parents were because I had been left on a doorstep. I was explaining why I was in Ak'Anon when that impatient gnome Wyloon said, "Uncle Wyndsor! I want to hear the rest of the tale!"</p>

<p align=left>"Quiet down, Wyloon! I will continue in a minute. Right now there is something else to be taken care of. You were saying, lass?"</p>

<p align=left>"Wyndsor? You are known as Wyndsor?"</p>

<p align=left>"Yes, lass. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p align=left>I showed him the note. "Wyxle? What does he have to do with anything," he said. "Oh! Brell save us all. I think I know what this is all about. You know nothing of your natural parents and yet were told to mention...him. Someone is trying to make you believe that that...rogue...is your father. Well, I wouldn't put it past him, but coming here and claiming such a thing is rather peculiar, don't you think?"</p>

<p align=left>"I...I...I didn't know that I would be such a p..p..problem. I'll go now." I picked up my pack and turned to leave.</p>

<p align=left>"No, no, no...after all, if it is true that you are family, I couldn't turn you out. Please stay here and once everything is settled we can see about finding Wyxle and sorting this mess out," Wyndsor said wearily.</p>

<p align=left>"Okay," I said. I wasn't quite sure where to sit, and Wenceslaus and Wyloon asked me to sit between them, so I did. Wyndsor continued his tale, althoguh none of it made any sense to me. When he finished, he stated that they were off to Crushbone. It sounded quite ominous to me. Wyloon insisted that I be allowed to stay in the city until their return, and Wyndsor agreed. Wyloon snuck me some money with which I bought some much needed armor and spells, and I set to practicing and exploring the city.</p>

<p align=left>They have yet to come back, but I am sure that as Brell is watching over them. I pray they will all return in good health, if not in good spirits.</p>
