<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">Hail all, <br> It has ben some time since I have been involved with any RP on the sonoma shard of late. Though before<br> the split I had been active in many of the quests and such. Some of us need a break now and again:) <p> Anyway...Wynter has put together a cafe just south of britain on the trammel facet. Her plans are to have a<br> Bardic event once or twice a month as well as other events. There is a full working cafe on the rooftop, a<br> game room on the second floor, and a music hall on the first floor. (I am not looking to make much money<br> there as the prices of foods and games and such will be priced to rebuy the items at cost and bit to keep<br> vendors alive). What I need is contacts for Bards who would be interested in playing in the Hall... The cafe<br> will have a live waitress at different times to be decided as soon as I find a waiter or waitress who would like<br> to host the cafe with me. I am willing to accomidate any request, and offer the use of the cafe for anyone or<br> any event. I wish to contribute this endevor to the role playing community of Sonoma. But your help is<br> needed as well as appreciated. any suggestion please :) <p> I hope you hear from all of you, <br> Wynter Iceblade <br> and her Player </font>
