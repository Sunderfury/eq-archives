<p align=left><b>Ode to Akalabeth</b><br><i>by Pasquat</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>'Twas the night of the festival and all through the keep.<br>
There was merriment and music….no one could sleep.<br>
The banners were strung from the walls with care.<br>
In hopes that Lord British would even be there.</p>

<p align=left>Brim stood at the doors beaming with pride.<br>
He shook hands and gave hugs as he sent them inside.<br>
Come one and come all to the our Sage Keep!<br>
He even welcomed the one known as Gleep.</p>

<p align=left>Inside the great hall, 'twas truly a scene.<br> 
A paladin, a bard and yes a Blood Queen.<br>
There was Littlewode and Jade, in her popular greens.<br>
Why there were even some dastardly OES fiends.</p>

<p align=left>Crawling through dungeons for a new spell.<br>
Running from demons and monsters from hell<br>
They stood and they marveled at all the old scrolls<br>
The tomes and the books all looted from trolls. </p>

<p align=left>Said Nivek …Why I remember the first orc that I killed.<br>
I was a quite a young lad…fairly unskilled.<br>
I fireballed and and arrowed but orc he fought back<br>
This cabbage and book I found in his pack.</p>

<p align=left>Now it's Corp Por and Vas Flam<br>
Not much to be said<br>
A much bigger flamestrike<br> 
And then they're quite dead.</p>

<p align=left>Enough of this talk, there's food and there's drink.<br>
Lichbane glanced at the door …and my lady I think<br>
She smiled as she entered…"Was I gone too long?<br>
He shouted to the bard…Lad give us a song!<br>
Jediit sang and strummed the great harp.<br>
Fair Gwenneth charmed a young mongbat, naming it Yarp.<br>
Hawkeye laughed and grabbed Brigadier.<br>
Rhi lifted her mug and let out a great cheer.</p>

<p align=left>They sang and the danced all night in the keep.<br>
Till the wee mornin' hours called them to sleep.<br>
At long last, there remained just a few.<br>
The rest had since made their way back to Yew.</p>

<p align=left>Gwen in her gown and Brew in his kilt.<br>
Marveled at the ale the sailors had spilt.<br>
Santiago, Tara!… Mae called them by name.<br>
I'll tell Enosh, that ye are to blame.</p>

<p align=left>Ar! Mae, ye do that, my magical wench.<br>
Santi reached for her rear, for one last pinch.<br>
Tara giggled and staggered toward the keep's door.<br>
Pinch that one matey and ye'll be kissin' the floor. </p>

<p align=left>Stubby leaned back…a big smile on his face.<br>
It did his heart good…they all loved the place.<br>
Its fame would spread both here and away.<br>
May the light shine forever on beloved LOA</p>
