<p align=left><b>Captain's Log, the Sitxh O' December</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Weighed anchor at Empath Abbey to steal…errr, I mean, to pick up some supplies. Booze, mostly, since I got enough fish steak to last me 'til the end o' the warld.</p>

<p align=left>Met up with Rehan at the vault. He wanted to know if I had any gold on me. Hah! Turns out he's collectin' money to buy a house fer close to two million crowns! Blimey! I don't think thar's many coins in the whole world! Anyways, I got a whole stash o' pirate treasure, but he's not gettin' any of it. I need it to pay fer booze an' wenches! Wenches in particular, since they be more expensive, though ye can sometimes get 'em on sale or fer free, dependin' how desp'rate they be.</p>

<p align=left>Paid a quick visit to the ol' village whar I met up with a cousin o' Acen, the ol' jester. Bunch o' other folks thar, but I din't recognize a one of 'em! Times have changed, I s'pose…lots o' new faces since I last been here. Listen to me, I sound like an' ol' salt! Speakin' of ol' salts, I ran into Broog, too…turns out he's opened a metal shop for 'imself, sellin' swords an' armor an' that sort o' thing. Even said he'd do repairs fer free, which is good, since me sword gets tired after one too many battles at sea.</p>

<p align=left>Set sail for Nujel'm. Been too long since I kicked up the sand on them sunny beaches. Thar's good winds, an' I hope to make port by tomorrow, or the day after.</p>
