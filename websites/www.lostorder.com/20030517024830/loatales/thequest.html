<p align=left><b>The Quest</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>"Sciurus , here is yer pay 500 crowns fer this month and 500 hundred fer next" Enosh said, handing his tillerman a small pouch filled to overflowing with gold coins.  "That should keep yer stomach filled and you bottle full till I return."</p>

<p align=left>"So where 'xactly are ye goin' cap'in?" Sciurus  asked, unsure why his captain would pay him to take a month's vacation.</p>

<p align=left>"Sciurus, ye know well enough that I've been laid ill by some foul hex since me return" said Enosh, who even now was battling to keep his eyes open and his spirit in the realm of Britannia.  "I shall be sailing to me former home in Serpent's 'Old, I hear that the recent spell of the cabal has torn open a great chasm in the rock."</p>

<p align=left>"Aye Captain, but why would ye want to go to that place lest yer on some mad quest fer yer own grave?  There be nothing but elementals and foul beasts crawling from that crag and the others like 'em in Trinsic and Minoc."</p>

<p align=left>"That may be, but I've nothin' to fear from those ilk.  I have a feelin' that the cure to me sickness is on the other side.  I intend to get to the other side and find the cure, or die trying." Enosh said managing to form a smile on his tired face.</p>

<p align=left>"What is supposed to be on the other side of that chasm captain?" asked Sciurus.</p>

<p align=left>"Ye weren't with me when I went sailing fer an island that the Zog Cabal prophesied about.  Well I never found it, fer the cabal enchanted me and me ship and threw it into a great mist."  Enosh said, remembering well the white hair and wrinkled skin that they're hex laid upon his body.</p>

<p align=left>"And ye think the chasm will take ye there?  What fer the love of the virtues gave you that idea?"</p>

<p align=left>"Last night I slept at the shrine of Humility, and in me dreams that night I saw the place I once quested fer."  Enosh said looking off into the distance.  "In me dream I was once again walking the isles of Serpent's 'Old, when I came upon the cavern that the cabal's spell created.  Being adventurous I crawled down that chasm and found the isle of the cabal.  The sea around it was shrouded in the same mist that once entrapped the 'Wake and I knew that here there existed magic enough to cure me sickness" </p>

<p align=left>"Then good speed and good hunting m'lord, in a month I shall find passage to the hold to look fer ye then."  Sciurus and Enosh then shook hands and parted ways.  Enosh hoisting the anchor and unfurling the sail, Sciurus  running off to Moonglow to buy himself a warm meal and an ale.</p>
