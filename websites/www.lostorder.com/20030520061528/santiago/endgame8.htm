<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I can&#146;t
believe you&#146;re going to carry that thing all the way back to Kaladim,&quot; said
Bierfreund, staring at the dead shark that Walterus was dragging along behind him.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Why not?&quot;
asked Walterus. &quot;I caught it, didn&#146;t I? I aim to make a meal out of it.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund glanced
back at the three humans whom they were now leading to Kaladim. &quot;They probably think
you&#146;re crazy.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Crazy? Me?
I&#146;m not the one wearing a polar bear skull on my head.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well,
you&#146;ve got a point there.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">They walked for a
while in silence. The overcast skies made the forest seem darker than usual. The woods
were strangely quiet, aside from the occasional sound of fluttering wings as a bat flew
overhead.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We&#146;re
being watched,&quot; said Bierfreund.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Walterus continued
walking, but his eyes darted to the trees of the forest. &quot;Goblins?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye,&quot; said
Bierfreund. &quot;Up on that hill to our right. Several of them. What do you think we
should do?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Attack!&quot;
screamed Walterus, charging up the hill.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Brilliant,&quot;
muttered Bierfreund. He turned to face the three humans. &quot;We&#146;ve been caught in
an ambush. Walterus and I will hold them off. You folks run as fast as you can along this
path. It will take you straight to Kaladim. Be careful!&quot; He turned and charged up the
hill after Walterus.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;What did he
say?&quot; asked Greyhawk.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Rothan shrugged.
&quot;I don&#146;t know. I think he was speaking the dwarven tongue.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I think he
wants us to follow him,&quot; said Eshay.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">By the time the three
travelers reached the top of the hill, the two dwarves had already defeated one of the
goblins. But they were badly outnumbered, and both of them were bleeding badly from
several wounds. Some of the goblins spotted the newcomers, and charged toward them. The
battle was joined, and what followed was a chaotic frenzy of clashing weapons and spell
explosions. More goblins fell to the ground, but there were still too many of them.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Fall
back!&quot; shouted Bierfreund, as he deflected a goblin blade aimed at his throat.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I&#146;m not
done yet!&quot; grunted Walterus, hacking the legs off of one of his foes.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Suddenly, there was a
brilliant flash of a light, followed by a tremendous explosion as a bolt of lightning fell
from the sky, searing their foes. Many goblins fell, and the rest were beginning to rout.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Good work,
Rothan!&quot; shouted Greyhawk, as he crushed the skull of a goblin that was trying to run
away.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It wasn&#146;t
me,&quot; said the mage. &quot;It was them.&quot; He pointed to three elves who had just
arrived.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Greetings, elf
friends!&quot; said Bierfreund. &quot;We are grateful for your assistance.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Greetings, good
dwarf,&quot; said Kileyan. &quot;I am glad we could be of help against these foul
creatures. There were quite a few of them!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Bah!&quot;
muttered Walterus, wiping the blood from his forehead. &quot;We could have handled
them.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;A glorious
victory!&quot; said Penaden. &quot;I think I&#146;ll sing a song!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Wait,&quot;
said Jarlaxle. &quot;Let me get my spear ready.&quot;</font></font></p>
