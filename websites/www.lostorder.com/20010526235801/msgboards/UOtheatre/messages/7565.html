<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">Thank you for the correction. Of course, that is an important part of the strategy. It is a little esoteric to maintain, but with my Str of 79 I can take only one flame strike, if that. It doesn't do anything for Poison Spell though. Does Resist help with that?
