<p align=left><b>From Within The Depths</b><br><i>by anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Within the peak of the hallowed hill, pale wisps of smoke filled the near-darkened temple, scenting the inky air with myrrh. Tall, pillar-like candles burned dimly, giving the room an eerie glow. A solitary figure knelt at the altar meditating. His elven tongue wrapped itself around the Drow chants with great art. He uttered, "Far Darrig in Loughleagh... Conn-eda Laoghaire. Far Darrig in Loughleagh... Conn-eda Laoghaire." The silhouette rocked forward and back in time with his rhythmic prayer. Suddenly, a gust of wind blew through the lofty vestibule, snuffing out the flickering lights, and seemingly snuffing out the consciousness of the lone Drow. The room fell silent in the pitch of blackness. </p>

<p align=left>"Caerdin...Rise Caerdin. Your time is at hand. The time of reckoning has come."</p>

<p align=left>He awoke with a start, his onyx eyes squinting to see. A supernatural glow...a darkening glow, shone through the darkness. His eyes adjusted to the luminescence. His eyes widened as he scuttled backward on all fours. A dark figure emerged, backlit with the unearthly light. The Drow bowed his head to the floor. In the languarge of the dark elves he said, "Kestanan, you honor me...to visit me in my meditations."</p>

<p align=left>"Get to your feet, Caerdin.You have been chosen.The time has come it shall begin."</p>
<p align=left>"My Lord?"</p>
<p align=left>"As written in the teachings, the darkness shall inherit the lands."</p>
<p align=left>"Chosen, Lord Kestanan?"</p>
<p align=left>"Allow me to speak, my child..."</p>

<p align=left>Caerdin fell silent and again assumed the kneeling position. He leaned foreward to listen.</p>

<p align=left>"I have set things in motion, young Caerdin... In a few days, wrong doing will be discovered. Many seasons ago, the brother of your father had a coupling with a human woman. As you know, Drow blood is the most sacred of things, and it purity must be kept. A child was the result of this coupling, and cannot be allowed. The child and woman were left in the forest to fend for themselves. The woman perished, however, the child flourished in the forest. You do know the sentence for this crime, and what must be carried out, do you not?"</p>

<p align=left>Caerdin nodded solemnly.</p>

<p align=left>"On the morrow, your uncle, as your father, will be put to death. Your uncle...for his crime."</p>

<p align=left>Caerdin abruptly interrupts: "My father, Lord Kestanan?"</p>

<p align=left>"Alas, my child, he is too aged to carry out the remedy. I am sorry, but this must be the way. Fate is already written. As you are the only of your lineage...of age, you will be called upon to fulfill the law. You will be called upon to extinguish the light of the impurity, or face the same fate as your father and uncle. You will be sent from the depths into the light."</p>

<p align=left>"Yes, Kestanan."</p>

<p align=left>"You will take this opportunity, Caerdin, to assist the band of humans that I have assembled."</p>

<p align=left>"The Humans, Kestanan?! The surfacedwellers?! Assist them?!"</p>

<p align=left>Kestanan placed a comforting hand on the Drow's shoulder.</p>

<p align=left>"Darkness serves all, young Caerdin. They are of a like mind, and you will help them. Your fate is written as well. The humans know me as the Shadow...as the Drow know me as Kestanan and as the Dwarves know me as Valan. The Darkness has many names...but one purpose. Prepare yourself, young Caerdin. Go to them, these Shadows of Akalabeth. Your time is at hand..."</p>
