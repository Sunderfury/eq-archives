<blockquote>
<p align=left>Dear Manik Compolten,</p>

<p align=left>Father, are you insane? How can I form a well-disciplined Patrol out of the rotted and illfitted cogs you have given me?? Two, TWO priests that are always spending time to speak with Bristlebane, as if he listens to such puny clerics. A common footpad that tried to steal the lute from the local representative from the League of Antonica. A magician that did nothing but go into fits where he would stare at nothing for hours. A wizard that kept running ahead, despite verbal threats and a sound cuffing. Finally, that enchantress you sent me...she is a brazen harlot? She barely knew the others before she was inviting them to her bed!! </p>

<p align=left>A Patrol is suppose to protect innocent Gnomes and serve the interests of Ak'anon. I know that since you formed the powerful Watchmen you have not needed Patrols to enforce Ak'anon's laws, but even if we serve only a reconnaisance role, how can we if you give me such a motley bunch? </p>

<p align=left>Regardless, I will do my best even if I have to teach them the very basics...like breathing and speaking and eating. But we will be the best Patrol, despite what you think of my abilities. </p>

<p align=left>Your Martial Daughter, Sincerely</p>
