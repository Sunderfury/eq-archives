<p align=left><b>Journal - Day Six</b><br><i>by Wysll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Well, I don't know where I am right now...all I can see around me is blackness. Thank goodness I have the spell to summon a light globe - I got it just to improve my skills, but now it has come in handy.</p>

<p align=left>When we started this morning, everything was going fine. Wyxle claimed ignorance of his 'daughter'...I think he protested a bit too loudly. (We're all pretty sure Wylia is his daughter, so we'll treat her as a niece until we get any proof to the contrary.) We had decided to look for our 'Aunt' - I guess that's what you'd call her...</p>

<p align=left>I was with Wyll and Wyxle (Wyndelle and Wyloon had gone on ahead of us -) when we decided to make the long trip to Nektulos Forest, it being about the most shadowy, evil place any of us could think of... perfect for a Darkmor in exile, I thought.</p>

<p align=left>Well, I'd just about resigned myself to another boat ride home, when a human female came up to us, saying that there was a gnome girl that had been captured by the orc slavers from Crushbone.</p>

<p align=left>Now, that's normally a rare occurrence. So rare that we probably would have gone to her aid anyway. But what the woman said then sent goose flesh down my spine. She said that the girl could be any one of us - that she looked *very* much like we did. The human uttered an incantation and vanished without providing any more useful information. (Really - why do they always provide little scraps like that? You'd think someone with an important message would at least try to be more complete.)</p>

<p align=left>Well, since we are the type of Gnomes we are, we resolved to detour to Crushbone and rescue this damsel. When we met with Wyndelle and Wyloon, we filled them in on the human's message.</p>

<p align=left>We proceeded to Crushbone, sharing the road for a time with Yabbernox, a guild brother of ours. After exchanging news of others, and stories of battles won and lost, we parted company. It is good to know that people of such mettle are my guildbrothers.</p>

<p align=left>We were almost to Crushbone when who should we meet but Azlana - another guildmate, and one of prodigious thirst. Since Crushbone is not exactly safe, Azlana agreed to come with us until we saw the girl safely home.</p>

<p align=left>We entered, and were almost immediately beset by problems. We searched the slave mines for any sign of her, but found nothing. I was just about to suggest we look elsewhere when I heard Wyndelle's spectral voice telling me that he had fallen in the lake, and was beset by a blackness he could not understand.</p>

<p align=left>Knowing that Wyndelle can usually look out for himself, we resolved to continue looking for the girl in the orc camps just beyond the mines. Wyxle had gone ahead to scout....his thievery does have its uses after all. He cried out that he had found the girl...mostly naked, but little the worse for her ordeal. Her name was Wynnie, which gave me pause. I had no time to think on it, for we were making haste to the safer realm of the Greater Faydark.</p>

<p align=left>I hung back until I could make sure the girl made it out. Better that I get waylaid, as I can use the Wizardly arts to escape such snares. She looked too tired to do much in the way of the arcane arts.</p>

<p align=left>We had just left Crushbone when I felt a dizzy spell overtake me. I staggered a bit, and momentarily lost sight of my brothers. My vision returned after a few seconds, and I thought I was alright. Then, whatever arcane majik took Wyndelle fixed it's talons on me, and would not let go. I felt myself moved to another plane of existence. Knowing how dangerous such trips can be, I immediately started praying to Brell to watch over me. I remember seeing spectral figures in the air in front of me, in a language I have never seen before. They faded after a time, and left me .... here.</p>

<p align=left>Wherever *here* is.</p>

<p align=left>So I sit (float?), writing by the light of my summoned globe. As far as I can tell, there is nothing here but me. No wind, rain, floor, sky....I cry out to my brother, Wyndelle - but he does not answer.</p>

<p align=left>I do not know who has brought me here, or why.</p>

<p align=left>But I plan to find out.</p>
