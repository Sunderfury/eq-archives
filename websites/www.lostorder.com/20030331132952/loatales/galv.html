<p align=left><b>The Origin of Sir Galventine</b><br><i>by Galventine</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The tower was dark and silent as the sorcerer lit the black skull candle in the center of the pentagram.  For twenty long years he had waited.  He would wait no longer; tonight the kingdom would be his.  The vile mage smiled as he drew a jeweled ceremonial kukari from his belt and slowly slit his palm from end to end.  He watched with satisfaction as blood, black at pitch, ran down his fingertips filling the sacrificial goblet.  Raising his hands to the sky, Jabal spat the ancient words of power, daring the gods of light to stop his sacrilege.  No sword of justice struck his limb; no bolt of lightening did interrupt his hellish incantation.  The gods of goodness and love gave no answer but the dark gods of malevolence did reply.</p>

<p align=left>The flames burst up from the mystic braziers as sulfurous smoke rolled to the floor blanketing it with the essence of evil.  Amid the demonic glyph a misty shape took form.  Three times the height of a man the hell-born minion stood.  Taking the chalice from the altar, the creature drained it dry, black blood ran down its malformed face like leprous tears.  Crushing the now empty goblet with one massive hand, the daemon turned and spoke.  His voice shook the castle walls to their very foundation.</p>

<p align=left>"Who hast dared to summon Demogorgon the Destroyer, Archduke of the Abyss?!"</p>

<p align=left>The sorcerer was paralyzed with fear at the sight of this monstrosity.
It has the head of a huge dire wolf, the maw of the creature easily wide
enough to swallow a man whole, with fangs as long as daggers.  Its torso was
that of a man or rather a giant, the arms alone the size of tree limbs and
its chest like that of a trunk.  The demon's legs were bowed backward like
the haunches of an animal but covered with hard armor like scales.  Behind
these legs swinging a good four feet above the ground was an enormous
serpentine tail.  The tail too was covered in scales and ended in a large
scorpion like stinger.</p>

<p align=left>This daemon was unlike any the dark sorcerer had ever seen before but his lust for revenge would not be denied.  The man gripped the ancient manuscript tightly and found the courage to speak.</p>

<p align=left>"I, Jabal Musa, dark mage the Ponfar, have summoned thee to do my bidding!"</p>

<p align=left>The Daemon Lord stepped deliberately over the boundaries of the
conjuring circle, closing the distance between himself and the sorcerer in two mighty
strides.  Jabal's eyes grew wide in terror, as the daemon approached.
Never, had he heard of a daemon with the will to leave the confinement of the
pentagram without permission of the summer.  This was no ordinary hellion
and Jabal realized too late the seriousness of his mistake.</p>

<p align=left>"Your bidding, mageling." The Daemon Lord laughed sinisterly, as he
grabbed Jabal Musa by the throat with one hand and lifted him from the
floor.  "Surely you jest, fool.  That must be it.  I have been summoned by the court
jester-for only an idiot would think he the power to control me."</p>

<p align=left>The mage fought frantically to break the grip around his throat though
it was pointless.  He was no more than a toy in the hands of Demogorgon.  An
evil smile played on the daemon's lips as he continued.</p>

<p align=left>"You amuse me little fool.  I would hear what you would have me do were
I at your disposal." The daemon hissed.  "Speak little man, why hast thou
summoned me?"</p>

<p align=left>The iron grip loosened but still Jabal struggled to speak.</p>

<p align=left>"Ard.d.  Arden, I would.have.you kill Lord Arden."  The mage gasped,
filling his lungs with air he went on.  "I would have his army defeated, his
wife widowed, and his throne left without an heir."</p>

<p align=left>Demogorgon's smile grew wider.  "I see." The daemon sneered.  "A truly
ambitious goal for such a puny mortal as thyself." He hissed.</p>

<p align=left>The man quaked in fear within the daemon's grasp but still he persisted.
"I summoned you, milord.  You are obliged to aid me."  The mage squeaked.</p>

<p align=left>The Daemon Lord tightened his grip again but then paused considering the
human's words.  "You have a point mageling.  Though surly you know there is
a price to pay for my services." Demogorgon snarled.</p>

<p align=left>Jabal shook his head vigorously in agreement.  "Of course milord.
Anything.I will pay anything.  Just name thy price."</p>

<p align=left>The Arch Fiend drew the mage in close enough to count the inner rows of
teeth in his mouth and the feel the hot breath blast from his snout.  "I
will do as you ask mage.  All you have said shall come to pass, this very night
in fact.  My reward shall be the woman.  The Lady Lysandar shall be mine own to
do with as I please."  The daemon spat.</p>

<p align=left>The mage was shocked.  That is it?  That is all he wants?  Jabal could
not believe his good fortune.  He was willing to give anything to see Arden
destroyed and all the daemon wants is his witch of a wife.  Hell, a few
moments ago the mage would have paid extra to have Demogorgon terrorize the
harlot and now he will do it for free.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, the woman is a fine payment for your services.  She is most
pleasing to look at though she be a common born wench." Jabal said smiling
deceptively.</p>

<p align=left>Demogorgon grinned hideously then threw back his head and howled with
laughter.  "Payment?" He smiled.  "You misunderstand me little man.  The
woman is not my payment.  She is a reward.  The price for my servitude is
your SOUL!"  The Daemon Lord growled.</p>

<p align=left>"And I will take payment in advance!"  Demogorgon roared in rage.
Opening his jaws wide, the daemon placed the man's head inside his gaping
maw and bit down with the force of a sledgehammer.  He flung the headless corpse
against the chamber wall exploding it like a wine bag under a wagon wheel.
Spitting out the remains of Jabal's head, the Daemon Lord laughed maniacally
and disappeared in a cloud of black smoke.</p>
