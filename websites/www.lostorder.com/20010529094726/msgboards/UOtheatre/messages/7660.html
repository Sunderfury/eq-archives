: Whilst I have been playing UO for a fair while now, I have a problem skill wise.  I've been playing for four months and got my first GM today, (Macefighting) with tactics close behind.  The problem I have is this.  These are my current skills and what i intend to, or just have :) Gm'med in:

: Musicianship
: Provocation
: Peacemaking
: Macefighting
: Tactics
: Anatomy
: Alchemy

: The problem with this line up is that I must dump two skills that I use often, hiding and resist spells, neither of which i think I can do without.  The same can be said, i feel, for the skills I have right now.  There is no way i can drop Alchemy:  it's a &quot;trade&quot; skill and as I don't have a shield or parrying, I need the healing potions and the other potions I make in combat.
