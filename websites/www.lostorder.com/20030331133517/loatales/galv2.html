<p align=left><b>Origins of Galventine, Part Two</b><br><i>by Galventine</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The siege was entering its sixth day. The catapults and archers rained 
fire around the clock but still the keep could not be breached. Arden's men 
took heart at the sight of their Lord, with them on the parapets, and every 
man vowed that Ardenor would never fall to the enemy. None knew then the 
evil they would soon face.</p>

<p align=left>The day grew foggy and dark clouds rolled in front of the sun obscuring 
its rays. Shadows engulfed the castle bringing with them an ominous feeling 
of despair. The men grew nervous with anticipation though of what they knew 
not. All was still, as still and silent as the grave-then they heard it. 
The sound chilled them to the bone.</p>

<p align=left>Demogorgon approached the castle laughing loudly, the way a child might 
laugh when going to play with his friends. The soldiers were aghast at the 
sight of the Daemon Lord. Many of them ran screaming from their posts, 
others dropped to their knees and began to pray, the rest were immobilized by 
fear. They stood and watched as the daemon drew near. The men's weapons 
forgotten, hung useless at their sides. </p>

<p align=left>A few yards from the castle Demogorgon stopped and raised his arms in the 
air. The clouds above boiled and churned, thunder rumbled through the 
heavens like a drum and lightening cracked the sky in a blinding flash. The 
daemon's body began to glow a fiery red as he harnessed the elemental 
energies of the storm. Bolts of lightening shot from his fingertips striking 
each of the remaining guards in turn. They died screaming, as the flesh was 
seared from their bones in blazing flames of white heat.</p>

<p align=left>The Daemon Lord stood before the gate of the keep, with his eyes blazing 
fire and tendrils of smoke rising from his nostrils. He smiled wickedly and 
opened his mouth wide. Flames roared from his mouth igniting the great 
wooden doors. Demogorgon watched the flames quickly die out leaving the 
charred and blackened wood beneath. The scorched gate crumbled in his hands 
like dried bread. Laughing with delight, he stepped through the remains of 
the door and entered the courtyard.</p>

<p align=left>What remained of Ardenor's forces finally gathered their wits and tried 
desperately to mount and attack. Archers fired a volley of arrows, in unison 
at the monster. With a casual wave of one clawed hand, the arrows burst into 
flame, falling harmlessly to the ground mere inches from the daemon's chest. 
Swordsmen rushed the creature in droves and were batted away as easily as 
flies from a sugar bowl.</p>
