<p align=left><b>Wyndelle's Misadventures IV</b><br><i>by Wyndelle</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Wyndelle rubbed the salve into the wound and gasped with the pain. Gebarn pointed and giggled at Wyndelle “That last goblin almost lopped of yer chin!” Wyndelle turned and looked at himself in the mirror. His goatee was mostly gone and a finger length slash along the cleft of his chin marked the path of the last goblin’s sword. Gone was the chubby face he remembered, and no longer did his eyes shine with the innocence of one just learning to see the world.</p> 

<p align=left>Now they shone with a passion for new knowledge, and a hunger for the next quest.</p>

<p align=left>“How long has it been Gebarn? How long have I been away from my brothers?” he asked his familiar. “ I don’t know master, my concept of time is not the same as you mortals. I measure time as the distance between meals… beyond that it all seems the same.” said Gebarn as he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle picked up the staff, his fingers running down the length of the shaft feeling every notch made by an orc’s sword, every mystical rune carved in it’s surface. “I am more powerful than I ever dreamed of being. Since arriving, my spell repertoire has trebled, what more could the old man want from me.” Wyndelle asked the ceiling.</p>

<p align=left>“I want ye to quit yer griping and GET YER ARSE UP HERE!!” came a shout from the chamber above. “Oooh yer gonna get it now master, he sounds as if he’s been eatin jum jum salad again, you know how bad that stops him up” said Gebarn. “I HEARD THAT YA POOR EXCUSE FER A CAMPFIRE!! YOU TOO, UP HERE NOW!!!"</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle shot a glare at Gebarn, groaned, then trudged up the stairs to his mentor’s chambers. The old gnome looked as if he’d eaten an undead gnoll, and the smoke coming from his pipe smelled worse.</p>

<p align=left>“We have a grave situation Wyndelle” said the mage. “The Runnyeye goblins have begun a campaign of terror against the halflings of this vale. Mayor Gubbins has asked me to look into the matter. I have not the time to deal with these invading goblins, as I have matters that I need to attend to elsewhere. You will go in my stead. Find the leader of this band, he is a wizard that goes by the name of Mooto,” explained the mage.</p>

<p align=left>“Before I go, pray tell me, how much longer must I stay?” “My brothers will be wondering where I am, and worried about me as well,” said Wyndelle.</p> 

<p align=left>You will be released from the geas that keeps ya with me when I feel yer ready, until then you’ll do as yer told. Now git goin you two,” replied the mage.</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle looked at Gebarn, shrugged his shoulders and headed down the stairs. When he could be heard getting his gear together, the old mage looked at his long time friend. “You think he’s ready Geb?” he asked quietly. “I don’t think anyone could really know until he’s tested master,” replied the elemental. “I’m not yer master anymore Geb, just an old man, a very tired old man,” sighed the mage.</p>
