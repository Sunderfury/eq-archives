<blockquote>
<p align=left>I started the day in Nanto, hoping to find solf. Instead I found that there are many creatures in Dereth whom aren't too fond of the likes of me. I was running from a band of unsavory creatures and accidentally slipped through a portal....I ended up in a place called Shoushi.</p>

<p align=left>I decided to explore the town and see what I could find out. I learned that everyone either knew nothing about solf or they knew but weren't going to talk. It seems he manages to leave quite an impression wherever he goes. I sold a few things at the merchants, got directions to Hebian-To, and set off.</p>

<p align=left>I stopped at the southeast outpost to rest a bit, and found that the shopkeep there had a staff...a "Jo" he called it...that was much better than that which I found in my pack upon my arrival in Dereth. I glady paid the man for it, and tested it out on a few snowmen and bunnies. </p>

<p align=left>On my way again, I was set upon by a band of drudges of varying types...and barely escaped with my life. I decided that it was time to rest again, as I was very weak. I headed back to the outpost to rest.</p>

<p align=left>I will continue my journey to Hebian-To on the morrow. Hopefully something will turn up there. I really do wish that solf had mentioned *where* in Dereth I might find him...all this mystery and intrigue is quite annoying, although it is quite like him to be this way...such is the way of the solf, I suppose.</p>
