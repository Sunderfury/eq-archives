<td><b><font color="#000000">EDITORIAL</font></b>
<br><font color="#000000">Hail and wellmet gentle readers (I write this
safe in the knowledge that neither Ogres or Trolls can read). After being
underwhelmed with contributions from you all I bring to you another edition
of the Akalabethian filled with cynicism, sarcasm, and just the smallest
hint of bitterness. As always if you wish to contribute then please email
<a href="mailto:ralineth@lostorder.com">Ralineth Oakenheart.</a></font>
<p><b><font color="#000000">CAZIC THULE CATASTROPHE!</font></b>
<br><font color="#000000">A small and well-armed party of Akalabethians
recently journied into the legendary temple to the evil God of Cazic Thule,
accompanied by a pair of Ogres who tagged along thinking we were going
there to worship. After sending a great number of lizardmen to meet their
maker, it seemed that the Ogres finally twigged to the fact that we weren't
there to pray to evil gods, in fact quite the opposite. This prompted one
of them to produce a train of rather tough lizardmen with a penchance for
healing each other. Valiantly we battled this horde of reptiles, until
it was obvious that discretion would be the better part of valour. After
calling for an evacuation we discovered that our mage hadn't quite grasped
the concept of saving mana for emergencies. At this point everyone decided
to hot-foot it through the temples maze. Strangely enough the lizards decided
that Ogres make very good sacrifices and after jettisoning our over-sized
friends to the pursuing mob the rest of us made it back into the jungle
of Feerott alive.</font></td>

<td><b><font color="#000000">DOING THE ORC-SHOE SHUFFLE</font></b>
<br><font color="#000000">Inndur, our high-elven cleric wannabe recently
discovered that Orc Centurions are not blue fluffy rabbits. After depositing
a number of corpses upon the soil of Greater Faydark, Inndur came to the
realization that that if it /cons red you'll soon be dead. We are all looking
forward to Inndur reaching level 5 and discovering the joys of exploring
the minotaur caves...</font>
<p><b><font color="#000000">TROLLS AND OGRES MASSING IN THE SOUTHLANDS</font></b>
<br><font color="#000000">Reports from the Innothule swamps and jungle
around Feerott indicate a massing of Trolls and Ogres in these locations,
hacking at the local wildlife to hone their 'barshing' skills. Whether
this means they are preparing to attack the human infested lands to the
North or they are about to commence their biannual warts wars between each
other we are not sure, but rest assured we will keep you informed of any
further developments.</font>
<p><b>FREEPORT&nbsp; ROGUE DISCOVERED BLIND DRUNK</b>
<br>Beur Tenlah, a two-bit pickpocket who haunts the tunnels around Freeport
was recently brought to the local healers after his liver gave out on him.
It seems that a large number of undesirables have been feeding him massive
quantities of Dwarvern Ale. Upon hearing of this local miltia were reported
to have been ecstatic, hoping that Beur had finally drunk himself into
his grave.

<td VALIGN=TOP><b><font color="#000000">SHADOW KNIGHT SWORD EXPEDITION
PLANNED</font></b>
<br><font color="#000000">Upright paladin of the Order Zirc is planning
a trip to a currently undisclosed location to retrieve a legendary sword
of evil named FleshRipper. Zirc plans to obtain this sword and place it
in safe-keeping to ensure it remains out of the hands of evil. He is currently
assembling a party of powerful dwarves, humans, elves and wolves to accompany
him on this expedition. One only hopes that the Ogre Shadow Knight Bagulan
(who is rumoured to have been hanging around the Ocean of Tears, and the
main culprit behind Beur Tenlah's current malaise) doesn't get wind of
this and intercept the sword before it can be destroyed. As always when
we get more information we will let you know.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><b><font color="#000000">PALADIN GOES FERAL</font></b>
<br><font color="#000000">Syndaen, potential paladin in-training recently
turned to the 'dark side' while hunting in Lesser Faydark. After his heroic
actions in saving a besieged stumpy legged creature named Suezzette from
a horrible death at the fangs of the spider Queen Nashjeeli. Still engulfed
by his blood-lust Syndaen then raced up to an innocent pixie in the forest
and proceeded to murder him in cold blood. Syndaen was reported to unremorseful
of killing the harmless creature and actually proud of the bow that he
stole from the still warm corpse before the pixies own family could retrieve
his belongings. The Paladins High Court has been unusually quite on this
subject, whereas the Wood Elf Council of Tunare is demanding blood.</font></td>
