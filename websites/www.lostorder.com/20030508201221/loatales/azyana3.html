<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Three</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Before I could begin my trip back to Freeport I had to get the belt my golden one had given me. He had glanced at my clothing at the wedding and I had forgotten it. I promised myself he would not see that again.</p>

<p align=left>I was just about to begin my trip when he contacted me and offered his company on my journey back. I had planned to make my way to the stone bridge and then perhaps ask one of the druids to come get me. This was much better as I was afraid to travel alone. How did he know I was to begin my travels this eve? He seems to know my thoughts.</p>

<p align=left>I met him outside the Halas bank where he cast his protective spells upon me and there began my first lesson from him. Always cast them before any journey. He has more powerful spells but I made note of this… Cast Center and Holy Armor before any journey. He had cast this Endure Magic spell upon me also. </p>

<p align=left>We made our way to North Karana with hardly a word spoken between us. My mind was preoccupied with watching the area for things that may attack me though I must admit my fear was less knowing that he was there. My endure magic protection had faded and he seemed upset with himself that he did not notice. He explained when in a group always cast a spell upon yaself first so when it fades ya will know when to recast it on others. He cast it upon me and we continued on. We had good fortune that Ailleen met us and was able to transport us directly to Northern Ro. I had met her once before when helping collect items for the Christmas celebration. Once there he cast his spells upon her and then we were off to Freeport where we bound ourselves.</p>

<p align=left>There at the South gate my lesson continued and he explained the spells that I must keep in memory… a healing spell, a direct damage spell, divine aura, root, gate. I was quickly memorizing the spells he mentioned and began erasing and rescribing the spells to the front of my book. He continued on telling me of spells to battle the undead. He also mentioned a stun spell and to my embarrassment I did not have it. Ever so kind he took me to the temple and found the spell. That made me feel even worse since it was a spell that I could use when I was just of the 5th circle and here I was of the 15th with it never scribed. Then to my shame I did not have the coin on me to purchase it. With out hardly a word he purchased and gave it to me. I quickly scribed and memorized it. I must remember to pay him back. </p>

<p align=left>Now that I have the correct spell in memory he told me the next lesson would be how to use them in battle, but since it was late it would have to wait until tomorrow. We said good night to each other and he was off again. </p>

<p align=left>I will be forever grateful that someone so kind has taken me under his wing and is teaching me how to be a good cleric. Sitting here alone in the temple my mind has been drifting off wondering why. I still have not come up with an answer. I mustn't think of that now, as I need to rest for tomorrow's lesson.</p>
