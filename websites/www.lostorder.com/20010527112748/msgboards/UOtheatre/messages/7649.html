: saturday got to conference center bright and early... since they didnt need me for my assigned volunteer duties    i offered help at other spots   and still had time to get in an extra session...  attended one on player towns, thiefs, (missed some cause had to stay to finish silent auction, and one on future of UO

: during lunch folks were getting their tshirts signed     i was like what a cool idea     since i left my tshirt at the hotel   i got out my fair program and got lots of autographs  (next year i can start earlier and get everyone)     spotted sunsword !!!  had met him in new york    and politely asked for his too      then the guys started laughing and i was like what.. and they all pointed to this guy.... and i was like mmm ok   read his name tag and was like omg !!!   it was designer dragon       they said  we thought youliked his too   hehehe    so with a  big grin i asked for his too and apologized for not recognizig him       but i'd never met him in person   (sunsword i had met at a ny luncheon last year so i knew what he looked like)

: ran around for some last minute souvenirs... a cloth map to hang on my wall, a black uo shirt (they were of extra larges in my first choice, but got another any way...next year... shop early!)

: managed to squeeze in a few minutes here and there to try out computers to look at uo third dawn  (females get gstring undies now, got to see new ratman and lizardman, watched some others play and kill harpies and demons.... graphics look very nice)

: the town hall was the last event... we all gathered in the big area and tyrant made his last speech    he is a riot    he was like we know we suck   hehehe   but at the same time you could tell they do want uo to be the best      his announcing the new hardward for all servers was met with big cheers          folks got up to speak a few words at the mike in the center of the room     suggestions for improvements were made for next years fair   (like not having music so loud,  banners up for all shards so folks could have a point to meet others from shard if they wanted to)   but over all every one seemed to agree it was an awesome event

: as we were leaving   a friend grabbed one of the huge signs... and i said hey me too... and grabbed the one in lobby  it was about five feet... and said uo fair registration  w/ uo logo   as i'm walking down street... it dawns on me its too big for a carry on for the plane hehehe   but a friend said he would mail it to me  but we had to cut off the bottom portion (all white any way)

: we all decide to skip the happy hour -- to loud and to crowded   and head to the area where the restaurant is where all folks from chessie shard are going to gather later

: hung out talked....  then went and had dinner nice steak house, private room   we needed it  hehehe  about 30 or 40 of us all got together - went around and made introductions and then    talked, laughed, talked and laughed some more

: then the bunch of us who play together all went back and hung out at the hotel and stayed up almost all night again      it wasnt till our eye lids were closing on their own that we decided we better get some sleep     which for most was about 4 a.m.      i had to leave by 6 a.m.  so i managed to get about 90 mins rest    but i can sleep any time    and it was just great finally meeting the goods friends i play with in britannia  and i hope next year even more can come to the fair

: it was a great time !!!
