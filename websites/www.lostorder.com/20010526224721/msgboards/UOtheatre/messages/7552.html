<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">Members of the Knights of Sosaria were sitting around the Drunken Dragon Tavern, dividing up some gold from a successful hunt as well as washing down a few dwarven ales.  I was getting another round for everyone when a well dressed couple walked in.  Greetings were exchanged, as Gwendolyn served an ale for the gentlemen and wine for the lady.<p>They spoke of their homeland, a placed called 'Bavaria' -- I think that's north of Minoc.  The lady spoke of a grand wedding they had attended before their making way to our community.  A crown prince and a princess were wed in beautiful ceremony.  To celebrate, the royal cavalry and king organized an enormous party, with a horse race as the centerpiece.  This all took place on a meadow known as Theresienwiese, and the celebration was named Oktoberfest.  The couple thanked us for the drinks and headed on their way looking very happy.  On the way out I asked their names, but, unfortunately, I fail to remember them now.  We wished them well and thought nothing more of it.<p>Back at the table, I pocketed my share of gold and eyed a kite shield from the treasure chest we unearthed earlier in the night.  Two tired looking gentlemen strolled into the Dragon.  While fetching some pieces of lamb and harpy ribs for the two men, I inquired as to their travels.  They were making way for Trinsic.<p>"We just finished with our harvest, and are taking this wheat and vegetables from our farms in Skara Brae,"  the first man told me as his friend went to tend to the horses.<p>"Must be a relieving feeling at the end of the harvest?" I asked.<p>"One would think, once the numerous months of toiling in the fields comes to a close.  Yet, it seems unresolved.  We make the trek to Trinsic, sell our goods..."  The man takes a drink of ale and looks up, in thought. "You know, it would be nice to find some way or somewhere to celebrate our good harvest before heading home.  And not just for me and my companion, I mean for all the farmers that work so hard."<p>The man left some wheat for our kitchen as payment for the ales.  I wished them luck and sat down across from Cubrethil, our Tavern Manager.  He had an odd smile on his face.<p>"You know what we must do, don't you?" he asked.  Of course I did not.  "We should throw a huge celebration for the farmers around the land.  As well, in honor of that lovely story the lady told us, we could call it Oktoberfest, with a horse race among other events!"<p>And so it was to be.  That night we sat around the tavern with smiles of enthusiasm as we made plans.<p>********************************************************<p>The Knights of Sosaria are proud to invite all citizens of the realm to an Oktoberfest celebration!  This will take place at the Elysium Rune Library and Drunken Dragon Tavern on Saturday, October 21, beginning at 7pm EST.
