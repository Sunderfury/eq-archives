<p align=left><b>Last Adventure of the Great Solf</b><br><i>by Bagulan</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A cool salty breeze blew over the deck of Stormbreaker as it sailed onward toward the dwarven lands of butcherblock. Solf wondered what treasures Walterus had found and why he insisted that Solf see it with his own eyes. Taking the parchment out of his pack he read it again silently. </p>


<p align=left>Brother Solf, <br>
I require your assistance in helping me discern the value of a magical gem I have run into. Meet me at the guard barracks near the ocean on the 14th day of this month where we can talk more.<br><br> 
Safe Travels,<br>
Walterus</p>

<p align=left>Enclosed was a crude drawn map showing the location of the guard barracks mentioned in the letter. Solf was anxious to see what this gem that Walterus had mentioned was. Since as early as he could remember Solf had always been fascinated by gems and crafting them. At an early age he had taken up the craft and up until now there was no gem that Solf had not crafted or seen. </p>


<p align=left>'Enough of that for now', he thought to himself, I am sure this gem is nothing more then a bawdy piece of glass that Walterus found in one of his drunken stupor’s. With a loud splash and the clanking of chains Solf realizes Stormbreaker has reached the port of butcherblock. Wanting to avoid the ever present street vendors Solf makes his way out of the port and into the mountains. The journey to the guard barracks takes most of the day, but at last the barracks comes into view. Solf can see from a distance what could only be Walterus standing under the torch light. </p>

<p align=left>Walterus waves and greets Solf as he approaches. 'Ahh welcome friend! So pray tell me how was your journey?'</p>

<p align=left>'Long and painful I must say friend, I have yet to get my sea legs and I could for the life of me keep nothing in my belly.'</p>

<p align=left>Walterus lets out a little chuckle, 'you always were a softy.'</p>

<p align=left>'So tell me Walterus what is so important to drag me half way across the world in this cold weather and didn’t you have a dark colored beard last time I saw you?'</p>

<p align=left>'Ohh yes my beard... well none of that hardly matters now does it?'</p>

<p align=left>Suddenly Solf is thrown against the stone walls of the barracks by a very strong magical force. Struggling against the magic Solf turns to Walterus. 'What’s going on!! What is happening to me?!!'</p>

<p align=left>Walterus shimmers and then changes into a cruel looking erudite dressed in a very ornate red robe.</p>

<p align=left>'What... Who.. are you?', Solf stammers while thinking of a way to escape, if only he could attract the attention of the guards sleeping inside...</p>

<p align=left>'Ahh my precious Solf has it been so long that would not recognize me? It has been nearly ten years now since you killed me.'</p>

<p align=left>No.. it couldn’t be, Solf turns pale, 'Razim???'</p>

<p align=left>'Yes! Razim the brother you loved so much yet tried to kill.'</p>

<p align=left>'I had no choice Razim you were mad, had I not stopped you Erudin would have burned down in flames killing thousands', Solf scans around with his eyes looking for a way to escape. </p>

<p align=left>'Bah! Erudin city of weak minded fools! I have come to finish what I started so long ago and you my little brother shall bear witness to it all!' Razim laughs evilly as two dwarven guards approach. </p>

<p align=left>'Halt! What goes on here?' shouts one the guards. </p>

<p align=left>'Ahh Solf now you shall see my power and how hopeless Norrath is against me.' Razim closes his eyes for a moment and then from behind a tree steps the largest orc Solf has ever seen. The two dwarven guards rush to attack the new threat as it approaches. The massive orc swings its blade at the approaching dwarves. The first guard begins to rush the orc then at the last moment rolls to the side dodging the swing of the Orcs blade. The second guard takes advantage of the distraction the first guard made and swings home a blow with his mighty two-handed axe landing squarely on the orcs arm. Yet the blow bounces off the orc not causing a single wound!</p>

<p align=left>Solf watches in amazement as the two dwarf warriors take swing after swing at the orc yet not one blow inflicts damage upon the beast. Luckily for the dwarves this orc seems to have forgotten how to use a sword and all of his attacks land short and are quite clumsy. </p>

<p align=left>'Enough games', says Razim, his eyes close again and the orc responds. Tossing the sword aside the massive orc lunges with the speed of a snake at one of the dwarves. Caught in the hands of the beast the dwarven warrior struggles to escape. Then the orc raises the struggling dwarf above his head and tears his body in half with ease as the dwarf screams. Tossing the two halves of the first dwarf aside the orc moves toward the second. Seeing his fellow guard brutally slain by this beast the dwarf charges with a vengeance. The orc stands his ground as the dwarf charges bringing his mighty axe to bear, with one hand the orc catches the axe in mid swing and crushes it with ease then slams the dwarf with his arm sending him flying thirty feet the other direction. Dazed, but determined the dwarf draws a short sword from his belt and charges yet again. Blow after blow rain down upon the orc, then a swing of the orcs arm lands on the neck of the dwarven guard and his head is cut off and rolls down the hill while his body collapses at the feet of the orc. </p>

<p align=left>'My God...', Solf manages to mutter out from under his breath.</p>

<p align=left>'See my power now little brother? My warriors are unstoppable and they shall make me ruler of all Norrath!'</p>

<p align=left>'What do you want with me Razim?',</p>

<p align=left>The orc approaches and stands next to Razim like a dog. Solf feels terror grow inside him at seeing this massive orc that had just slaughtered two veteran dwarven warriors. </p>

<p align=left>'If you are to kill me get it done with, I have no desire to listen to your mad ramblings brother.'</p>

<p align=left>'Oh no Solf, you are to live, yes live and see your friends die at my hands. You shall suffer more then you can imagine little brother, all in good time.'</p>

<p align=left>Solf can see the madness in Razim’s eyes as he uttered that last sentence, from the corner of his eye Solf caught a glimpse of something green oozing from the orcs left arm. </p>

<p align=left>'Sleep now brother, when you awake Norrath will have begun a new age under my rule.' Solf feels his head slam into the brick wall of the guard house as he hears the insane laughter of Razim, then the world goes black.</p>

<p align=left>.....</p>

<p align=left>'Water.. no.. the ocean.. in the ocean...wait.. I am drowning.. no..drowning..help help!!!', Solf wakes up screaming as Walterus pours a bucket of water of his body. </p>

<p align=left>'Whoa! its okay brother you are in good hands and from the looks of this place lucky to be alive.'</p>

<p align=left>'Walterus?? Is that really you?', Solf tugs on Walt’s beard as Walterus yelps, ahh tall friend watch me beard!! Solf sighs with relief, 'it is you brother you don’t know how glad I am to see you.'</p>

<p align=left>'I be glad to see you as well, but ye have got some explaining to do. Here I come checking on the status of the guards and I find two of my guards horribly mutilated and you laying unconscious here.'</p>

<p align=left>'Yes there is much to tell you brother, but we must talk on the way let us make haste for your city we must speak with your king.' Solf runs by the second dwarfs corpse and picks up the short sword and then he and Walterus quickly head to the dwarven city.</p>

<p align=left>.....</p>

<p align=left>Trumpets sounded their entrance into the throne room of King Stormhammer. The room was astounding as each wall and pillar was carved out of the mountain and then polished so that it seemed to give off its own light. Banners of every dwarven clan hung proudly in the throne room, each one decorated with gems and lined with gold. Solf had to catch his breath at the sheer beauty of it all. </p>

<p align=left>The King then spoke, 'Captain Walterus what trouble brings you here?'</p>

<p align=left>Walterus kneels in respect to his king then begins to speak. 'My King my friend Solf knows of a great danger to our kingdom and all of Norrath, may he be allowed to speak?'</p>

<p align=left>The King shifts in the thrown his interest aroused, 'he may.'</p>

<p align=left>Solf approaches the King and then kneels in respect next to Walterus. 'King Stormhammer there is a great evil in your land. My brother has come into possession of some kind of power and plans to destroy all of Norrath.'</p>

<p align=left>'Bah! What power could possibly destroy all of Norrath?', The King looks upon Solf with interest waiting for him to explain.</p>

<p align=left>'Somehow my brother Razim has created a race of enormous orcs that have the strength of giants and cannot be harmed by normal weapons. One lone orc mutilated two of your finest guards and was hardly injured using only its hands.'</p>

<p align=left>'Is this true Captain Walterus?' asked the king. </p>

<p align=left>'Yes my king it is, I saw the bodies of the guards with my own eyes.' </p>

<p align=left>'The Kings face grew very pale and he turned to Solf, 'what do you ask of me then Solf?'</p>

<p align=left>'My King while this orc seemed invincible he was hurt by this small short sword, it has some strange markings on it.' Solf hands the sword over to the King and the King inspects it. </p>

<p align=left>'These are no strange markings, this is a sword of my elite guard. These are crafted deep within our city and giving secret dwarven runes to aid in combat.'</p>

<p align=left>'That explains it then your majesty, these orcs require strong magical weapons to harm them. With more of these weapons we may stand a chance against this deadly threat.'</p>

<p align=left>'Yes we may be able to defeat these so called orcs, but what of this enchanter Razim?'</p>

<p align=left>Solf paused a minute before answering, 'I killed him once my King I can do it again.'</p>

<p align=left>'Very well then,' King Stormguard rises from his throne, 'Summon my guard' he shouts, 'and bring me my armor we are going to war!'</p>

<p align=left>Bells begin ringing throughout the city as dwarves rush to prepare the guard for war. Walterus leans over to Solf, 'I hope you know what you are doing friend.'</p>

<p align=left>'Aye Walterus, so do I... so do I.'</p>

<p align=left>.....</p>

<p align=left>The dwarven column marched in formation through the mountains. Their armor and weapons faintly glowing with a dull blue aura. Generations upon generations were spent in learning to forge the arms that the elite dwarven guard now carried into battle. King Stormhammer lead the attack force in his full suit of the most powerful and ancient dwarven armor while wielding the mighty butcherblock hammer. They had marched to Crushbone, the only place Razim could hide such a powerful army. Solf and Walterus marched up front with the King looking for any sign of danger as they neared the entrance. </p>

<p align=left>A dwarf in light armor ran up to meet them, he stops in front of the King and saluted. 'My King Crushbone is empty'. </p>

<p align=left>King Stormguard looks surprised. 'Empty?! How can this be? Solf you bring me here to fight an enemy that does not even exist?!' </p>

<p align=left>The King looks angry as Walterus interjects. 'My King something is amiss here let us see this empty Crushbone with our own eyes.'</p>

<p align=left>'Very well captain we shall proceed, but if there be no real threat I shall have your friend imprisoned for the rest of this short life.'</p>

<p align=left>The dwarves all march into Crushbone and find it empty with no sign of life. </p>

<p align=left>'How can this be?' stammers Solf. </p>

<p align=left>'Argg I tell ya there is nothing here Solf and you shall spend your life in prison now for your false tales.'</p>

<p align=left>Then it happened. </p>

<p align=left>The ground gave way under the dwarves and they all fell into a underground cavern beneath Crushbone. Solf got up slightly bruised and he was astonished at what he saw. There was Razin standing upon an altar holding two glowing orbs chanting as orcs walked thru a strange pulsating gate. </p>

<p align=left>'Ahhh Solf you have found me', said Razim not looking the least bit suprised. 'You brought some friends too it seems, my aren’t they short little ones now.'</p>

<p align=left>'Razim you have gone far enough and you must be stopped.You won’t catch me off guard this time so give up, you know your magic was always weaker then mine.'</p>

<p align=left>'Yes little brother it was, thank you so much for bringing up that painful memory.' Razim smiles as he holds up his orbs, 'that was of course before I found these beautiful magic orbs.' </p>

<p align=left>Razim’s face takes on a scowl as magic energy lashes out striking Solf’s mind. Solf quickly throws up a magical barrier to protect himself, but the force is so great that he stammers back a few steps. The orcs around the portal stand lifeless and the dwarfs await their orders as the two enchanters fight a duel of magic power. </p>

<p align=left>Solf concentrates and turns into a werewolf. Solf lashes out and changes the force of gravity near Razim throwing him up in the air and trying to slam him back down. Razim quickly mutters a few words and softly begins to float before he hits the ground. </p>

<p align=left>Pain surges through his body as Razim tries to destroy his mind. 'He is so powerful now', Solf though to himself and I can’t take much more of this. Solf falls to his knees under the mental assault. </p>

<p align=left>'See little brother you are no match for me and the ancient Orbs of Tashan!!'</p>

<p align=left>Solf begins to get weaker and staggers. Yes... the orbs.. the orbs! Solf uses the last of his strength to summon a whirlwind to assault Razim. Razim laughs as the winds hit him, 'you think this little apprentice trick can hurt me??' </p>

<p align=left>Suddenly the winds pick up force and blow one of the orbs out of Razim’s hand. The orb flies through the air and shatters against the stone portal. When the Stone shatters the orcs begin to shimmer and move. Their illusion fades for all to see... The dwarves all stand in horror at the sight before them. Where orcs once stood were the foulest creatures any of them had seen. Standing over twelve feet tall these creatures looked like gigantic spiders, standing on two legs and using 4 legs as arms. Their skin was made of some black armor and their arms had claws the size of a claymore on them. NOOOOOOOOO shouted Razim. You fool look what you have done! The spider beasts begin to wake up and start screaming wondering where they are. 'They will kill us all!, but not before I destroy you Solf!!', Razim raises his hands about to unleash a magic attack when one of the spider beasts rises behind Razim and thrusts his claws through his belly. Razim screams and drops the second orb, then the beast uses its huge claws and tears Razim apart while his screams echo the cavern. </p>

<p align=left>'I have seen enough of these beasts!', Shouted King Stormguard. 'For Kaladim and for all of Norrath CHARGE!!!' </p>

<p align=left>The dwarven column charged forward crashing into the spider creatures. Screaming back the beasts attacked, while greatly outnumbered they fought with the power of giants throwing dwarves across the cavern and breaking their armor with enormous strength. Walterus targeted out a beast and charged forward with his might axe. With great speed Walterus brought down his axe three times in rapid succession while dodging the blows of the spider monster. After the third blow an arm fell off the beast. The beast lashed out at Walterus with lightning attacks, while the great magic armor of his dwarven ancestors protected him some blows still got through and he began to bleed. The dwarves were beginning to fall back the might spider creatures too powerful to defeat, but the dwarves pressed on for their King was in this fight and they would fight till the last dwarf. </p>

<p align=left>Solf drew the attention of a spider monster and was knocked back off his feet landing next to the head of Razim. The spider creature moved in to finish off Solf as he tried to regain his footing. In an instant Solf flashed his options through his mind. These beasts were immune to most physical attacks and possessed super strength. Their armor probably protected them from most damage spells so he could not hope to hurt them. The spider creature roared as it raised its claws above aiming to strike down Solf. </p>

<p align=left>'Wait', Solf said to himself, 'Razim was able to control them by magic, so they must have a weak mind. Yes that’s it!!'. In an instant Solf lashed out with his most powerful mind destroying spell. The creature staggered back grabbing its head as his whole body quivered. Solf began to sweat as he increased his focus until finally the beast collapsed dead at his feet, his brain turned into mush. Solf glanced up and saw that his friends were getting hurt bad the several hundred dwarfs were no match for hundred or so spider beasts. </p>

<p align=left>Solf’s eyes fell upon the last globe Razim had when he died, quickly Solf picked it up. Power surged through his body and he became aware of thoughts around him. He could feel the fear in his friends hearts, he heard voices of what they were all thinking. What was a powerful artifact for a weak enchanter made a strong enchanter like Solf near God like. </p>

<p align=left>Solf began to float up above the battle, then with one spell he attacked. Lighting surged from his hands as it hit the first beast, then it jumped to the next beast and the next spreading like wild fire. Each beast that it hit would stagger for half a second until their head exploded. In less then ten seconds the battle was over and all the creatures lay dead. </p>

<p align=left>.....</p>

<p align=left>The dwarves began tending to their wounded as King Stormhammer and Walterus approached Solf. 'What did you just do to them Solf?', Walterus asked. </p>

<p align=left>Solf turned to face Walterus his eyes glowing with power. 'I destroyed their minds, while these creatures are strong in body their minds are weak. In this way Razim was able to bend them to his will, with the help of this orb.' </p>

<p align=left>Suddenly another spider creature steps through the pulsating gate. The dwarves took up their swords once more, but there was no need. Solf glanced over shot a bolt of mental power at the beast making its head explode. 'I fear more of these creatures may continue to endanger all of Norrath.', Each word Solf spoke seemed to echo throughout the cavern as his power seemed even to flow from him at his very word. </p>

<p align=left>Another spider beast steps through the portal this time Solf does not destroy it, he controls him. Floating over to the beast Solf touches his head. Thoughts and images run through Solf’s mind... another world... yes... deserts.. humans enslaved.. spider like..... spiders enslaving humans..... He probes deeper into the thoughts of the beast, he asks the creature what do you want... emotions flare in the spider beast... destroy...enslave new world... </p>

<p align=left>'Enough', says Solf, with a motion of his hand the creatures head explodes like the others. </p>

<p align=left>'So what does this mean Solf?', Walterus looks concerned. </p>

<p align=left>'This portal is a gateway to a new world, one that has been under the rule of these insect like creatures. This portal must be closed or else Norrath will be consumed by their wrath.',</p>

<p align=left>Walterus jumps up to the portal, 'well I can fix that one for ya.' Walterus raises his giant axe and swings down at it. </p>

<p align=left>Solf waves his hand and stops Walterus in mid swing. 'No, the portal must be closed on both ends or else it will just reopen. I must go and close the portal on the other side, wherever that may be.'</p>

<p align=left>'No Solf,' Walterus interjects, 'allow me to, you are needed here in Norrath. Your friends your brothers and your sisters need you. </p>

<p align=left>'Your heart is large dwarf and it shall stay so, in Norrath. I am the only one with the power to face what may lay on the other side of this portal, so only I must go.' With that Solf turns and walks into the portal and disappears. A few seconds later the portal begins to pulse and shake. </p>

<p align=left>'Everyone get out of here!', yells King Stormguard. The dwarves quickly get above ground just as the cavern below them explodes and caves in on itself.</p>

<p align=left>.....</p>

<p align=left>'You will be greatly missed Solf', Walterus said with a tear. </p>

<p align=left>With that Walterus read off the inscription on the stone. “Solf Hero and Savior of the Dwarves and all of Norrath”. </p>

<p align=left>'Ahh it almost looks like ya', Walterus chuckles to himself as he looks up at the statue of Solf in the courtyard of the Palace.</p>

<p align=left>Turning his back he walks away, there was a rumor of a goblin rising over at the docks, a warriors job is never done. </p>

<p align=left>'Almost like me', echoes a voice... 'almost.. '</p>
