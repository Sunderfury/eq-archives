<p align=left><b>Journal of a Scholar Part III</b><br><i>by Friar William</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>After awaking underneath a bush I diceded it was time for me to seek out this wizard's study. After finding the microrifts I know I needed little more then the Tome of Making in order for me to reproduce a Rift. I cleansed my robe of some dirt and followed a narrow path. </p>

<p align=left>After a few hours of a fatigueing walk I spotted a clearing in the woods. Much to my surprise some people seemed to have constructed a Village in the middle of the woods. I even spotted a small fountain, and I kneeled down beside it for a drink of crystal clear water. I think I didn't sat down for more then a minute or two before a villager started a conservation. I asked him wether or not they had a Library in this fine city, wich they aparently didn't have. While I said to myself no respectfull village doesn't have a library the young lad asked me what book I was searching for. Mentionning the Tome of Making certainly seemed to arrouse his interest and before I knew it an entire group of villagers was listening at my tale. </p>

<p align=left>I explained them about the Evil Wizard that was supposedly the last owner of the Tome. I told them he had a study somewhere on Fire Island, a study with a large pentagram inside. Ofcourse I read about his study in the records of my mentor's library so I knew it was deep within the bowels of Hythlot. At the time I didn't reveal I already read one record of the Wizards life, I'm still somewhat cautious on revealing too much information. And I was right not to trust every man as a sinister looking character named Victen Demacles appeared. These villagers didn't seem very fond of him and he didn't make much attempts in making himself admirable. When someone asked him to leave, without warning, he flunged at me with a sharp katana. Before the shocked villagers realised what was going on his swords ripped a large wound in my chest. Being a fragile old man I immediatly fell to the floor and the world turned black before my eyes. I woke up amidst a group of villagers all concentrating their healing powers on my battered body. Aparently they scared off the attacker and managed to save me from the clutched of death. I still felt weak and defenceless but we all agreed we couldn't wait any longer, so we decided we'd head off to Fire Island. </p>

<p align=left>After a very small journey we arrived at the shores of Fire Island. I shrugged off the fear an lit an old lantern as the brave soldiers of the Akalabethian Order led us into the Dark Castle. It didn't take long before the hallways were filled with steel clinging into steel, desperate battlecries and words of magic. Seemingly hordes of Orcs flunged at us with little regard to their own life. The more we progressed the more opposition we seemed to face. After hours of battle and countless precarious situations we arrived at a large room with demonic symbols and a large pentagram drawn in human blood. The party pauzed for a second as I kneeled down to examine the pentagram. After that everything happened fast, seemingly out of nowhere a large winged deamon appeared out of thin air, striking at it's nearest target with his humongous sword. My the Virtues protect us!! It's the Collecter of Souls !! someone cried out. The party spat apart, warriors and mages alike running in every direction. I myself found a small crate I could hide behind and watch as the brave adventurers regained their faith and rushed forward to attack this evil fiend. After a long and damaging battle the beast was finaly slayn, but much force was lost in this fight. Nevertheless we pressed on and behold in the backroom we spottet something that appeared to be a study. As we entered the room another winged deamon appeared and attacked us without warning. No longer afraid of i's appearance the men and women slew this beast notably faster then the first one. I began a search of the room for clues. </p>

<p align=left>After a few minutes of searching I uncovered a small tattered book entitled 'journal'. I flipped a few pages and cried out to my friends: This is it!! This is what we need! It's the Wizard's journal!!! Quickly my friends let us head off to safety so I can examine this! Not willing to risk the dangerous long path back out the dungeon Atlantia opened a magical gate and a few minutes later we found ourselves in the sanctuary of the LOA Village again.....</p>
