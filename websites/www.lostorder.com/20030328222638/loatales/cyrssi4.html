<p align=left><b>Day Four</b><br><i>by Cyrssi</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Dear Elandel,</p>

<p align=left>This entry shall be short, as there was little of note that happened today. I have been tailoring for most of the day. I now have a decent stash of silk swatches, and Iago now has many pairs of patchwork gloves. I just wasn't in the mood for a fight as I usually am. It must have been the depressing weather. It was windy, cold, and rather wet. I don't remember the last time it rained that much. Then again, we usually spent our time in the desert where rain is a rare occurence.</p>

<p align=left>I made a rather feeble attempt to rid the lands of some reavers, but they would always find a way to outlast me, and I grew weary of the constant meditating. It gave me a headache. After a while I just went after lions and the occasional spider, as they are easier prey and quite useful in my new endeavor. One good thing that came of today is that I will soon have a nice lizardscale mantle to replace this old mesh mantle that is getting quite worn. Gonandar seems to have an extra one and has agreed to let me have it for a price. That was the highlight of day, so you can imagine what everything else felt like.</p>

<p align=left>I hope that tomorrow's entry will prove more exciting and cheerful. I'm just tired from a long day that never seemed to go quite right. I shall write again tomorrow, as always.</p>

<p align=left>Goodnight, brother.</p>
