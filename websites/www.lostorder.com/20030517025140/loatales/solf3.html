<p align=left><b>New Beginnings</b><br><i>by the record keeper</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The hunchbacked figure leaned in the corner of the room, slouched over his desk like a starving dog guarding his last meal. His pale skin looked almost ghostly by the light of the single candle. His shaking hand dipped the quill into the well of ink, and he touched it to the yellow parchment.....</p>

<p align=left>The tall figure finally found the strength to stand, and like a newborn calf he shakily surveyed the land around him. Rolling green hills, trees, fresh air, it was all so familiar. The smells though, and the sounds, reminded him just how different it all was.</p>

<p align=left>He slowly pulled the hood of his robe away from his face, revealing a new sun.</p>

<p align=left>Again, he was a stranger in a strange land, and had to start anew.</p>

<p align=left>He felt magic in this land. That was good. He also felt danger in this land. That was not good, but it was not like he hadn't grown accustomed to danger by now in his many lives.</p>

<p align=left>The stranger walked cautiously for a while until he found a road. Then he followed that road until it led him to a town. He could see others in this town in their daily routine.. conducting life in this strange new world that was as old as time to them.</p>

<p align=left>He walked into this town to learn as much as he could, because he knew, he had a lot to learn.........</p>

<p align=left>The hunched figure stood, and went to the shelves across the room for more parchment and ink. Apparently, this was going to be quite a long story.....</p>

<hr>

<p align=left>The bent figure once again leaned over his old oaken desk, quill in hand. The ink touched to the parchment, and his stroke was clean and steady, with a penmanship of unequaled skill. The tale continued....</p>

<p align=left>The stranger learned soon enough that the inhabitants of this world already spoke his language, which was a blessing he had not counted on. The grass here was green, the sky blue, and the folk were, for the most part, friendly. he soon learned that the name of this town, the one he would call home for now, was known as Holtburg. It was a far northern town, and for the most part isolated. Isolated as much as a town in this strange new world could be, anyway. There were, in this world, wondrous things called 'portals' that have existed for longer than most remembered. These 'portals' linked all the known towns and common places with a mystical sort of instant travel, traversing great distances with ease.</p>

<p align=left>He remembered something similar from a long time ago, moongates or something, but that was not important here and now.</p>

<p align=left>The stranger worked odd jobs for the locals, working farms and making deliveries, gaining trust and a reputation. Soon enough, he was being recognized by face. The people of this world, a world he now knew as 'Dereth', accepted him faster than he ever thought possible. It seemed that everyone here was also an estranged traveler from a great distance as well.</p>

<p align=left>One day, he recognized a powerful mage in the town square that he had seen before pass through, and began some casual conversation. They became friends, and so began the newcomers education in the magics of Dereth.</p>

<p align=left>The newcomer was no stranger to magic, having been an accomplished mage himself on other worlds, in other times. His knowledge grew quickly, and his skill soon followed. He chose the path of what Dereth knew as a 'war mage'.</p>

<p align=left>So the newcomer was beginning to feel less and less of a stranger in this new world. His confidence grew daily, and soon enough he felt he was ready to try his newfound skills in the wild, and test the dangers and challenges that this new world represented.</p>

<p align=left>He packed his gear, his spell reagents, and wearing the meager clothing that his short career of odd jobs had provided, and set off for the hills to find his new fame and fortune in the rich lands of Dereth.</p>

<p align=left>The hunched figure rested his pen in it's well, and pushed to parchment to the side to dry. He rubbed his eyes, stretched, and went once again to the shelves for more candles, the night had seemed to grow a bit colder and darker as his tale continued....</p>

<hr>

<p align=left>The broken figure that is our author once again hovers beneath the candle light, his brush strokes even and fluid, he continues his tale.....</p>

<p align=left>Days passed into weeks, and into months. Seasons came and went, and then the big frost came upon the land. The stranger had grown more powerful in his magics, perfecting his skills.</p>

<p align=left>He was not a leader of men. This world had a strange rule of society, one which seemed to require individuals to swear themselves to one another. Yet, he had not gathered a 'flock' as many in the land had.. and he had not sought a patron either.</p>

<p align=left>He was a bit reclusive, and withdrawn in his studies. He was not an outwardly social person, and for the most part preferred to be alone with his thoughts ad he wandered the land. Some would consider him a quintessential mage, the kind if old fable.</p>

<p align=left>Fate had taken him, at this part in our tale, to the small coastal town of Hebian-To, where he would wander the beaches hunting for magical artifacts and thinking to himself.</p>

<p align=left>Months he had been here now, and seen the world go through many changes. he had made a name for himself, but no friends. He could not escape the feeling he was missing something in this world... something obvious, and it was eating away at him.</p>

<p align=left>As he walked up the beach, hunting as he had done dozens of times before, he saw a figure up ahead... wielding a crossbow with astonishing accuracy. He began a circle around this man, so as not to disturb this archer's hunt. A respect all too often not shown in this world.</p>

<p align=left>"hail !!", the archer called after him. He stopped, turned, and waited for the approaching archer. With his head bowed down, he glanced upward at the man, and took in his features.</p>

<p align=left>The archer wielded a light crossbow, of exquisite workmanship, obviously earned through many a great battle. He had fire red hair, and a beard to match. He was a limber man, of fair strength, and a kind smile. He could tell that this was a well liked man, self confident and a skilled warrior. "Greetings, archer. What may I do for you?"</p>

<p align=left>"I have seen ye on this beach before, but you always were gone before I had the chance to approach ye.", the archer smiled. "I may not be a seer or a mage of sorts, but I knew this day would 'appen sure enough."
The stranger thought that sounded a bit ominous, and raised his guard just a bit. "Do not try to riddle me, archer. I am in no mood, and if there are to be any riddles here today, they will be of my device. If there is nothing else you wish from me, I shall take my leave."</p>

<p align=left>"HAR HAR HAR !!! AR !!! That's how I remember ye, allright ! Like I told ye, I'm no wizard, but I saw through yer disguise sure enough. What do ye say we head back to the tavern, and talk about times past over an ale or ten?", the archer grinned.</p>

<p align=left>"My friend, I do not know who you have mistaken me with, but mistaken me you have. I am sorry to disapoint you, but you will be drinking alone. I do not know you, so again I must... "</p>

<p align=left>"Me lord and saviour help me... ye surely do know me. I go by the name Orion Red in this world, and if ye look into my eyes, you will surely see. You know me better than most, old friend."</p>

<p align=left>The stranger looked straight into the archer's eyes, "I have no name in this world, and I have no friends, I just wish to walk this beach and....", there was a spark there, in Orion's eye, and a glimmer of a past forgotten.... the stranger gasped, "Greyhawk?"</p>

<p align=left>"AR !! A sailor's heart never lies. I knew it was you... now come, let's get out of this sun and go get some refreshment."</p>

<p align=left>They walked, the mage in stunned silence, the archer rambling on...."I am not the only one you know, there's a whole lot of us here now. I can't believe ye've made it as well.. Tass is here, and Enosh... let's hurry, we may catch Joxer at the Tavern.. it's still his breakfast time. Kileyan is here as well, and Lars. And do ye remember.."</p>

<p align=left>The stranger smiled to himself, finally feeling fulfilled in this new world... he had found what he was missing.</p>

<p align=left>The small, crooked silhouette cleaned his quill on an old rag, and close his well of ink. He blew lightly across the last page, to make sure is was drying properly, and he closed the book. This part of his tale was finished.</p>

<p align=left>There would be more volumes, and grander tales within them, but what makes any tale more important than the other when you tell of a life? His was not to judge, just to witness and record.</p>

<p align=left>So he sealed this latest volume with wax, and set it at the end of the shelf. He absent mindedly dusted the past volumes with his left hand as he admired the title of this, his newest addition.</p>

<p align=left>'The tale of how The Solf came to Dereth'</p>
