<p align=left><b>Dark Powers</b><br><i>by Wimble</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Did a cloud not then pass over the face of the sun? Was there not a sudden chill in the air, as if a force of unimaginable dark power had just emerged from a long slumber? The mountains themselves seemed to tremble beneath the miniature feet of the gnome as he scurried along the foothills.</p>

<p align=left>The Dark Powers had informed him that a band of adventurers would gather on this night…a band whose path was inextricably entwined with his own. They would become powerful some day, said the Dark Powers, and they would hold the fate of the world in their hands.</p>

<p align=left>Now, some people thought that Wimble was completely insane, and that the “Dark Powers” were nothing more than imaginary voices in his head. Wimble knew better, of course. He was absolutely certain that Fate had chosen him, and that he would one day take his place as the rightful ruler of Ak’Anon. And then…oh, boy! All those people who had once made fun of him…he would teach them a lesson or two!</p>

<p align=left>But when he first encountered these adventurers, he began to question whether or not the Dark Powers were playing some kind of joke on him. A motley assortment of simpletons they were, seemingly more concerned with fun and frivolity than with the pursuit of ultimate power. Madness, it was! Wimble watched from the shadows as they unwittingly provoked a whole nest of spiders upon themselves. Reluctantly, the evil little necromancer came to their aid, using his vast powers to drive some of the spiders away, sacrificing part of his own life force to heal their wounds.</p>

<p align=left>And did they thank him? Did they acknowledge him as their savior and praise his vast, undeniable power? No! Instead, they just ran off to Ak’Anon where they got drunk and ran around like fools! That woman Calixta, for instance…not only did she try to get the others into bed with her – she actually became a bed! This is how they squander their meager power, when they ought to be planning for the day when gnomes will rule the world!</p>

<p align=left>Well, what’s a servant of evil to do when faced with such impediments? Wimble decided to bide his time for now. He would stay in the shadows, watching their ‘progress’ and coming to their aid when they got in trouble (as he knew they surely would). And when the time was right, they would fulfill their destiny and help him to become the true and rightful ruler of Ak’Anon – and then the entire world would tremble in fear! Muhahahahaha!</p>
