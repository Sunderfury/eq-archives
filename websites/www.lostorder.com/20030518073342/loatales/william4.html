<p align=left>As our party sat down in the Tavern of the Village I began paging through the Wizards journal. It held some very intresting information. Firtmost it explained the presence of the two fierce deamons around his study. Aparently they are residues of the Evil Wizard. It would appear that whereever he had a strong emotional event a ghostly imprint of his soul would remain, plagueing those who would follow his footsteps. Surely a fact we'll have to take into consideration in the future. I already knew he was seeking immortality and he hoped the Tome would deliver it, but his last entry revealed he was heading to a place he called the Warriors Graveyard. He aparently feared the clan of Ettins that lived nearby and wanted to make a pact with them in order for him to study the corpses there in peace. Many villagers frowned upon the Warrior Graveyard and couldn't think of such a place, but I had read about such a desolate site and was determined to trace the Wizards footsteps. </p>

<p align=left>But the long and hard journey to Hythlot completely fatigued me so we decided it was best to rest before we pushed on. We agreed upon a time to meet and I started to make my way out of the tavern as a young lad stopped me. He asked if he could talk to me in private. I agreed and followed him outside. My dear friend Atalantia and a fellow Akalabethian followed us, as they seemed to distrust this fellow. A magical gateway opened up and we all went through. I took a brief look at the surroundings and concluded we were in the middle of a rather bad smelling swamp. Right in front of us there was a dark looking Tower. Cult of Infernal Necromancy, the tattered sign said.... not very promissing. I feared of what was lurking inside but followed the man inside nonetheless.</p>

<p align=left>A most sinister tower it was indeed, with skulls and bones everywhere, nay I cannea say I felt at ease. The lad led me throuhg several passageways when all of a sudden a dark figure appeared in front of me. He raised his hands and a hidden trapdoor closed behind me. He grinned rather sinister and welcomed me to his keep. He tossed the lad a few coins and barked he was no longer needed. He quickly gathered the coins and disappeared through a hallway. A guard stepped out of the shadows and the dark looking character who was apparently called Smogg Azalin told me to follow me into what looked to be a meetingroom. He made it very clear I wasn't going to leave before I answerred all his questions. </p>

<p align=left>First looking anxiously for a way out I calmed down and decided it was time to shuffle the cards on this Azalin character. I said I would tell him all I knew, if he agreed on MY rules. I would reveal him a first part of my knowledge right there and then and I would reveal the second part when I was safely released at the doors of the Empathy Abbey. He was outraged, even threw a book at me threatening to tear me limb from limb if I didn't tell him what he wanted to know imediatly. But he quickly realised I was willing to take my knowledge to the grave if it should be necessary, so he agreed. I told bits and pieces of what I knew before our trip to Hythlot leaving out some details as I didn't think I should aid him too much. Now it's time to head of to the Empathy Abbey I notified Smogg. Abit reluctant and cursing he opened up a gateway to the abbey. I quickly slipped in and found myself in a backroom of the abbey. Azalins guards protected the door as he himself walked towards me damanding the second part. I began to stumble something about a Graveyard somewhere when all of a sudden the door flunged open. With much display of force Atalantia and her friends stormed through the doorway, clearly frightening the guards. Azalin cried out, you promised!! I had your word!!! I took one glance on Atalantia, glanced on the dark Cultists and calmly said that a word given under the threat of force isn't a true word and followed the Akalethian warriors to safety. </p>

<p align=left>By now I was completely drained of force as my old bones were ready to collapse. The brave warriors led me to the Fogwood Village nearby and I searched for a secure restingplace.... many events filled this day, if I should continue I would need a good nights rest. I prayed my new friends a safe way home and dozed off for a very long sleep.</p>
