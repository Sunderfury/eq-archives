<p align=left><b>Shared Visions</b><br><i>by Keeshi</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Padded feet moved soundlessly down the darkened corridor. The mage amused himself slightly by watching as the light emanating from torches sporadically placed throughout the passageway danced upon the walls. His pace slowed now as he approached a solid granite wall. Long moments passed as he stood completely still, his keen eyes taking in every aspect of the wall, the slight cracks on a few of the stones, spaces where mortar had been chipped away from between the blocks. Smiling to himself he passed his hand in front of the wall and uttered a single word of power. The illusion dissipated and the mage walked into passage now visible. As he entered the hall he turned to ensure the illusion had sprung anew. True to the strength of the forces that forged this keep so many ages ago, the illusion had returned, as perfectly as before. No matter how many times he had come to see the master in his private studies, the sheer magnitude of the magicks involved in making such a structure overwhelmed him. Would he ever compare to those that had gone before? Did he even deserve to walk within these hallowed halls? Shaking his head he banished such thoughts from his mind. Of course he belonged, the doubts he now felt where the weakness within him being amplified by the magic inherent to the keep. Such defenses were in place to keep intruders from staying overly long, yet from time to time, especially the closer one got to the Shard, the effects could over power even the most noble of souls.</p>

<p align=left>He now found himself standing before an oaken door. The iron hinges had blackened with age, yet still performed their duties without fail. Quickly he adjusted his robes and straightened his hair a bit to ensure he was suitably enough attired and groomed for an audience with his lord. Finding all in order he took a step forward and knocked three times about the strong door, noticing as he did so that it had been carved from the trunk of a single tree. Pondering this he awaited an answer from within. Many minutes passed and the mage began to wonder if he had come on the right day and time. Reaching into a pouch slung on his belt he withdrew a scroll and unfurled it. His eyes darted towards the bottom and quickly found the area he was seeking. Curiously enough he was there at the appropriate time yet there was no answer from within. Again he knocked upon the wooden barricade, and again no answer was forth coming. His mind began to reel. Was the master within? Perhaps performing some great feat of magic that required the strongest concentration? Or perhaps a spell had gone awry and his lord was in need of aid. 'Well Solar, there's only one way to find out!" The mage exclaimed to himself, as he reached for the silver handle. Dexterous fingers grasped the handle as his muscles tensed. If the master were indeed performing a strong spell, then the door would be wizard-locked. Opening it with such a spell in place could well mean Solar's death. Deciding the risk was worth it he quickly shoved open the door. The antechamber was in place; nothing disturbed the tranquility of the small room. Solar gazed about the chamber, looking for even the slightest clue as to where his lord could have gotten too. Seeing nothing out of the ordinary he walked forward a bit to peer within the master's bedchamber. Again, everything was just as it should be. The bed was neatly made up and a small candle flickered eternally on the table beside it. Reverently, as if not to disturb the aura of his lord's private chamber the Solar backed slowly out and back into the antechamber. He moved silently to his right, coming to yet another door. This one he knew led to the alter of the Shrine and Tome, then to the master's private laboratory. He had never been within these rooms, but his concern for his lord grew more and more with each passing moment.</p>

<p align=left>Resolved on his course of action, Solar entered the next chamber and was nearly blinded by a light so white it pierced one's eyeballs. He attempted unsuccessfully to shade his eyes with his hands, yet this seemed only to intensify the light, causes him to yell slightly from the pain it was inflicting. The light, as if feeling his suffering, dimmed greatly allowing him (once his eyes adjusted) to actually view the contents of the room. There before him, suspended in the center of the room stood the Shard of Light. Now he understood what had just accord. A sense of warmth and compassion flooded his heart and soul. He found himself on his knees before the shard, worshiping it as though it were a god.</p>

<p align=left>"Nay my child, I am nary a god nor goddess. I am physical representation the hopes, dreams, courage, honor, and compassion of those within the realm who walk in righteousness." A musical voice explained to the mage. Solar felt the words within his mind and realized finally the power of the Shard. Rising to his feet he stepped lively around it, intent upon finding the master, and ensuring his welfare. As he passed the shard however he gazed behind it, wanting one more glimpse of the purity it offered. There, lying open nearly a quarter-way, atop a marble table was the Oracular Tome. Solar ceased walking spun about and came to stand before it. His fingers reached out to touch the parchment, yet he couldn't bring himself to touch the holy artifact. He rather ran his finger down the length of the page, barely an inch above the volume. "What wisdom lies within those pages? What long sought answers does it have to offer?" Solar pondered as his eyes lingered on the page. Then, as if remembering what he had come here to do, he once again spun about and came to the final door within his lord's chambers.</p>

<p align=left>Once he had heard tale of the master's laboratory. It was said the lord captured rare and mystical beasts and encaged them within so he might study them. Solar shivered slightly, had one of the beasts escaped and turned on the master? He then pondered of what use he could be, if the creature were capable of slaying the lord, he wouldn't fair much better. Gulping slightly he opened his reagent bag slightly for rapid use and flung the door open, the words of an offensive spell on his lips. The words slipped from his mind as he for the first time set his eyes upon the master's laboratory. There were no cages holding captive ungodly beasts, no pentagrams or spell components. The chamber was lined with shelves full of books, a placid pond sat in the center of the room; three feet behind the pond stood the masters desk and throne. It is here Solar's eyes stopped and filled with fear. The master lay face down across his desk; his torso didn't rise or fall with the intake of breath, making Solar assume his lord had fallen dead. Quickly he raced across the chamber, circling the pond giving it but one curious look as he passed, so deep was his concern for his master.</p>

<p align=left>Slowly Solar approached his lord. "Master? Milord? Lord Keeshi? Are ye well sire?" His voice cracked with concern. Yet no reply was forth coming. Sighing to himself Solar leaned forward for a closer inspection. Sweat dampened hair clung tightly across Keeshi's face, flipping it away with his fingers Solar turned his lord's head to see if he was still breathing. Solar's eyes locked with Keeshi's unblinking, wide open ones. A gasp escaped Solar at what he saw. There were no pupils, no iris, just deep green waves. Solar watched as the waves rolled on, faster and faster, deeper and deeper. The sounds of the ocean assaulted him; the call of a flying call beckoned him. "Aye, I shall follow ye." He whispered gently and looked deeper into the crashing waves.</p>

<p align=left>Pain exploded in Solar's jaw. He felt the blood begin to trickle from his lip as he fell backwards, landing quite unceremoniously on the cold stone floor. Shaking his head, he came back to his senses and looked to see what had assailed him. Keeshi sat in his throne, rubbing the knuckles of his right hand as he looked down at the mage. "Sorry bout that mate! Ye whar 'eaded somewhar I wasn't too sure I could get ye back frem." Keeshi replied, smiling down at his friend. "Common mate, thar's somethin important I need ye to see." Keeshi stood and reached down, grabbing Solar's arm and helping him to a standing position. Solar reached within his robes and withdrew a small handkerchief that he used to blot the tiny of trickle of blood on his lip. " 'ave a seat mate!" Keeshi smirked as he waved his hand, a cushioned stool appearing next to his throne.</p>

<p align=left>Wordlessly the two sat behind Keeshi's birch wood desk. With another wave of Keeshi's hand a golden tripod of a stand appeared on the mage's desk. "Watch mate, yer about to see somethin none other 'as yet to witness." Smiling once again Keeshi intoned a few words in a language so ancient they caused Solar's ears to burn from the power. From within the pond arose an orb formed of the clear liquid. Higher and higher it rose, floating forward as it did so. Keeshi's eyes were closed now, his finger moving slightly, guiding the orb down and atop the tripod. His eyes flickered open, Solar would have seen the waves crashing about had he be looking, however; his gaze was now fixated upon the now shimmering orb of water. "Look within the orb mate, fret not fer yer mind or yer soul. I am about to show ye what I jest witnessed, thou art in no danger friend." Keeshi's voice lowered, it's baritone shaking the very foundation of the keep.</p>

<p align=left>Solar looked deep into the orb, waves crashed within it, just as they had in his lord's eyes but a moment ago. Suddenly they began to calm, the water changing from the deep green of the deep ocean to the crystalline texture of the pond before him and his lord. Suddenly the water was gone, the orb was gone, the chamber itself ceased to exist. He found himself standing in a darkened chamber, no torches lit the room, yet he could see Keeshi standing beside him, a ghostly image which seemed to give off it's own light. Looking down at himself, he realized he too had taken on a wraith-like form. Smiling at the new sensation, and a bit awed by the magic it had taken to do such, Solar relaxed and looked about once again. As he did so torches all about the chamber burst into life, effectively illuminating the chamber. Though he had never been here, Solar knew he now stood in a chamber far more ancient then even he could fathom. His eyes once again began to examine the chamber. It was as though someone had carved a perfectly proportioned chamber out of a cube of onyx. The metallic blackness of the walls, ceiling and floor caused the torchlight to reflect in odd ways. Finally his eyes came to rest on the only furnishings within the chamber. Two biers of pure white marble stood in the center of the chamber. The first was empty as though awaiting someone to come and lie upon it. The other however is the one that drew his attention. Atop the bier closest to him lie an elderly man; his face was serene, as though deep within a pleasant dream. His clothing however was rotted away, as though time had left the man alone, yet done outrageous damage to his garments. Solar's head snapped back as the man's eyes opened slowly, gazing about from his prone position. The man rolled to his side and on shaking arms got himself to a sitting position, his legs dangling off the stone bier. He sighed deeply and pushed himself off the platform. Time-weakened legs could no longer support his form and he fell into a heap on the ground behind the bier. Quickly Solar raced forward to help the man to stand, Keeshi moving silently besides him. He reached down to help the old man and yelled in frustration as his hands passed through the man's form. "Nay mate, ye can nary 'elp 'im. Yer in me memories, what ye see now is what I saw but moment's ago. Ye can do nothin but observe I'm afraid. But watch, this is the good part." Keeshi whispered as if not wishing to disturb a sacred event. With that Keeshi looked to the wall behind the fallen man, Solar's eyes followed his lord's gaze. An opening appeared within the Onyx wall, it seemed as though the wall had melted to form the passage.</p>

<p align=left>In strode a man who appeared centuries older then the one upon the ground. "Milord!" The newcomer exclaimed. "Ye have awakened as the Tome predicted. I have come to aid ye!" The excitement in the ancient man's voice filled everyone within the chamber with child-like giddiness. "Do I know ye friend? Ye wear the color's of the Order, but I nay recognize thy face." The slumped man stated flatly, gazing at the newcomers burgundy robes and steel blue mage hat. "Milord, I am thy great, great, great, great grandson. Thou hast slept for ages sire. I have been tasked with aiding ye when ye awoke, and tis a good thing ye have done so now. I am the last of the Order which remains on this plane. If I had passed while ye rested, I nay know what would have occurred." The newcomer sputtered. His words coming faster then the slumped figure could comprehend. "One thing at a time please friend, I'm afraid my sleep hath taxed my mind a bit. What do they call ye?" The figure spoke once more to the newcomer.</p>

<p align=left>"Forgive me Sage Byron. I am called Mylron, named after my grand-sire who passed on many years ago." Mylron spoke boldly. The pride in his voice was unabated. "Please sire, swallow some of this mixture, it shall restore thy strength." The elderly man stated, setting a vile of shimmering blue fluid upon the prone man's lips. Titling it a bit so the Byron could drink it, Mylron watched patiently as the last of the liquid disappeared down his lord's throat, watching as the same glimmering coated Byron's form, giving him strength long lost by countless years of sleep.</p>

<p align=left>"Thank ye Mylron!" Byron exclaimed as he stood and gazed about as his surroundings. As if remembering he nodded slowly and gazed down upon himself. "By the Shard!" He exclaimed, as his face grew a bit red with embarrassment. "If ye would be so kind, could ye find me some garments my friend?" Byron asked gently as he absent-mindedly stroked his white beard.</p>

<p align=left>"But of course milord!" Mylron replied and waved his hand, muttering a few arcane words. A faded brown robe and black wizard's hat appeared on the bier. "Ye must forgive me sire, I long ago ran out of cloth of the Order's colors. These shall do until ye join the rest of the Akalabethians."</p>

<p align=left>"Aye lad, that they shall. Now tell me, where hath the Order gone, and how long have I been asleep?" Byron asked as he donned the robes and hat. Seating himself upon the bier he listened intently as Mylron related the tale of the Order's return to Sosaria, and some to other planes of existence.</p>

<p align=left>"Ah, so they have returned to the realm of British have they? Or at least the majority of them. I must endeavor to join them. That is of course if I have the strength to open the portal." Byron spoke thoughtfully, more to himself then to his companion.</p>

<p align=left>"We had planned for such an occurrence milord. Thy companion Sage Aeros left a splinter of the Shard here for thy use when ye awakened. He said with it ye could contact our brethren in the other realms, and seek their aid to bring ye to them." Mylron replied joyfully, as if he had made the preparations himself</p>

<p align=left>"Aye lad, I shall do that, but first I need to gather some strength. Will ye be coming with my to Sosaria?" Byron asked as he started towards the passageway out of the chamber.</p>

<p align=left>"Nay milord, I have lived my entire life here, and now that my duty is fulfilled, with thy permission I would like to spend the last few years of my life here amongst all that I hold dear." Mylron replied as he followed his lord from the chamber, nearly running to keep up with a man, centuries older then he himself...............</p>
