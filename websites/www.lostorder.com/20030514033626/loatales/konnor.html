<p align=left><b>Story of Honor</b><br><i>by Konnor</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Konnor lay on his back in the snow, blood running from his lip and nose. What he thought to be his last, the deep icy breath was exhaled from his lungs. But it wasn’t… he was still alive after the fall. He peered up along the side of the tower, his body motionless, until his eyes focused on the large wraith that stared over the edge. </p>

<p align=left>"Find him you fools! He shall not escape his fate!" the voice boomed in Konnor’s ears. </p>

<p align=left>The horrible sounds of bones and armor rushed through the broken windows of the tower and into Konnor’s ears. He was filled with sheer terror once more. How did he survive? His thoughts were cut short as a suddenly brilliant light filled his eyes, causing him to wince in pain. Suddenly his thoughts were elsewhere…. </p>

<p align=left>……The bells sounded throughout the city of Magincia….. it was a graduation from the colleges…. It was Konnor’s graduation…. Happiness… hope… A messenger rushes to him…. Will Ghostal… Paladin… Konnor’s father is missing….. a rocking ocean vessel…. Violent storms…. Arrival at the city of Minoc…… </p>

<p align=left>*FLASH* </p>

<p align=left>Cold air once again filled his lungs. Konnor slowly turned his head to see the doors of the tower burst open. </p>

<p align=left>*FLASH* </p>

<p align=left>….the caravan arrives at the Serpents Cross…. A beautiful couple… friends of Will… Aleph and Azrielle…. Night falls… Aleph and Azrielle leave to prepare their home for Konnor…. Dark… the door is broken down… the dark horseman… his glowing sword… grasps Konnor’s throat… tightly… the blue portal….. </p>

<p align=left>*FLASH* </p>

<p align=left>Konnor’s head was swirling. He could hear the sounds of the search party grow ever so close. The dreaded dire wolves howled as their skeleton knight masters held them chained. Konnor knew they could smell him. </p>

<p align=left>"………An Lor Xen…..," the wind seemed to whisper. The skeletal knights and their hounds passed right over him. </p>

<p align=left>*FLASH* </p>

<p align=left>…the dark tower… the black skeleton… Gath of Baal… his sword…. The wraith…. Killer… his claws raked across Konnor’s back… Gath’s powerful stature throwing Konnor around… the command… Killer commanded him to the alter… Killer’s powerful magics… pain.. despair… the roof.. the blizzard……. The watch… suddenly in Konnor’s hand… his father’s!… Will’s….Stand in Honor… the escape to the parapet… the leap… falling…but not falling… his decent is slowed by…something… the arms of a strong man… an angel… </p>

<p align=left>*FLASH* </p>

<p align=left>Konnor now remembered. His head lifted weakly. He felt the threat of the search party far away in the distance. He clutched the watch still, its engraving: STAND IN HONOR. Konnor slowly stood up and lift his head to the sky, snowflakes gently healing his wounds. </p>

<p align=left>A deep purple light cut through the darkness from the clouds above, encircling Konnor. His thoughts were cut short, as the light grew more intense, slamming his eyes shut. </p>

<p align=left>*FLASH* </p>

<p align=left>Konnor opened his eyes to the peaceful, soft glow of a marble temple. Everything was so clear. Konnor stood in the light of a brilliant being. A large figure, rather husky stared deeply into Konnor’s heart. His hair was long pulled back by a ponytail. He held with his large arm, the mightiest of battle axes. His body was draped in armor of purest gold. The figure pointed to Konnor. Konnor looked down and noticed he was draped in the finest of silver armor, with deep purple robes and tunics. On his wrist the watch of his father. The figure smiled and disappeared, yet the light remained. Replacing the large man stood three more figures, all draped in robes. </p>

<p align=left>"Behold the Truth of thy Awakening," said a familiar man’s voice. </p>

<p align=left>"Let thy Love guide thee," said yet another familiar, this of a woman’s. </p>

<p align=left>"May Courage guide thee to Honor!" said the last. </p>

<p align=left>The light grew ever more intense and faded leaving the young man in the place of his birth. The city of Trinsic. He now stood in the Hall of Paladins. Before him stood yet another figure that almost replicated his own. An aura of peace flowed from the man. It was his father, Paladin Will Ghostal. With tears in his eyes, he spoke: </p>

<p align=left>"Be herald to the Awaking my son. Lead me down the path of Honor." </p>

<p align=left>With those words, the father embraced his son once again. Silently overhead, the massive Lord of Honor nodded in approval. </p>
