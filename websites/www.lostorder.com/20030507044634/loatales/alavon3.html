<p align=left><b>Shouts At The Darkness</b><br><i>by Alavon Highwind</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Unconcious from his battle, Alavon lies in the woods of Yew. As his body rests and heals, his mind begins its battle. Darkness. "Where am I?" mutters Alavon, uncertain why he has no marks from his battle. From the 
darkness emerges a red robed mage, his eyes fixed upon Alavon. Alavon stands in disbelief as three more mages emerge
from nothing, all wearing red robes. They surround him, but make not one move towards Alavon. The mages don't move,
just stand and stare. From the darkness, Alavon hears a raspy voice. "You know them....", the voice utters. "It 
is them you most fear... and most hate...." Alavon clenches his hands on his bow as this is said. "Yes, I know them."
Alavon says. "And yes, I hate them for what they have done to my fathers name. Fear, however, is something I reserve
for no man or beast." The voice continues. "Ah yes, your father. Banished to the cold abyss for eternity. I know
the pain you feel young one. I can relieve that pain. I can give you revenge." Alavon closes his eyes, trying not to 
hear the words being spoken. "They are right here in front of you, the men that have made your life so harsh. Shoot 
your arrows through their hearts. Kill them..." Alavon, fully wishing he could raise his bow to shoot these men, instead does nothing. Finally he speaks. "They are defensless. It would be unvirtuous to kill them as such." The voice seemed upset by this answer. "The virtues have done nothing for you!!! Where were the virtues when your father was banished!! When your mother was slain like a dog!! Did the virtues help you when part of your soul was ripped from you?!?!" Alavon's face suddenly gives an expression of shock. "Yes... I know of your loss. You are incomplete.. forever missing a part of yourself. I can fill that space. I can make you whole. But first, you must do one simple task. Kill these men, and end your suffering forever."</p>

<p align=left>Alavon slowly lifts his bow, and aims it at the first mage. He draws back, and fires. The arrow misses the mages head by an inch. Alavon yells. "I will not be controlled by a voice!!! I will not listen to lies and empty promises!!! Show yourself and I promise you my next arrow will not miss its mark, for it will be lodged not in the body of these men, but in your own!!" Laughter fills the space. "But young Alavon, I am showing you my form. I am the darkness. I am the shadows..." "You lie!" yells Alavon. "Verily, I do not. I've heard your talks with the Priestess and Solar Windstorm. I know that on every beast you hunt, you picture your arrows hitting the men that stand before you. I know your pain, and can help you. I can give you freedom." "Just as you gave Yarp and Tara freedom? Just as you offer freedom to my elven breathren Feanor? I'd rather be enslaved to my past then gain freedom through you." The voice chuckles. "So you say, but I know your thoughts. You nearly killed one of those men, just barely bringing yourself to miss. You wish for freedom, you're just reluctant to take it. But I have time... as much time as is needed. Good bye forest child. I will see you again..."</p>

<p align=left>The darkness slowly fades and Alavon finds himself on the ground of the forest, still injured. He gets up regardless and leans up against a tree to catch his breath. Mentally and physically weary, Alavon knows that he is the victor that day. However, he came close to losing on both battlegrounds. "I need to train harder. I can't lose. Not now." Alavon limps off into the woods toward the abbey. "A good nights sleep will do me good. Perhaps the abbey walls will keep the shadows away for a night." As he walks, his eyes glance at every shadow. Still he can hear that raspy voice. And still one thing haunts him. Did he mean to miss, or was it a bad shot...</p>
