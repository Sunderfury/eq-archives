<p align=left><b>The Dwarf and the Bottle</b><br><i>by Yabbernox</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The dwarf slumped down at his table and gazed into his mug, seemingly searching for meaning in the foam of his ale. He looked up with interest as yet another fight broke out between the humans playing cards at the table in the far corner. Humans were quite the peculiar creature, he decided. Why should anyone take a risk such as gambling and get so angry when the outcome was not favorable?</p>

<p align=left>"For little more than a shack in the commonlands, this place sure is bustling tonight," mused the human who sat to his right. "I say, I don't understand how this place draws such a crowd, what with it's watered down brews. And so warm the stuff tastes akin to ogre swill, I'd wager."</p>

<p align=left>The dwarf grunted in agreement and smiled despite himself. Standing up, he headed toward the door. He wanted to think, and this was not a good place for doing so. As a few of the humans noticed his shortness of stature, they quipped a few short-jokes at his expense...probably hoping to incite a brawl, but the dwarf had already grown accustomed to such things and pretended not to notice.</p>

<p align=left>He stepped out into the moonlight, and walked for awhile without really paying a mind to which direction he was going. Finding a suitable spot, he sat beneath a tree and took the bottle he'd been saving from his pack.</p>

<p align=left>"Ahh...no one makes spirits like a dwarf," he sighed as the comforting fire gathered in his belly. "Perhaps I will find the answers in the bottom of this bottle." After so many years of trying to do just that, the dwarf knew this not to be true...but by the time the bottom was reached, he would no longer care about that little fact.</p>

<p align=left>Thinking back to his encounter with the orcs not too long ago, the dwarf's thoughts turned to the events immediately following his skirmish. The figure on the hill...who in Brell's name was it? And why was this figure always seeming to loom around the edges of his life for too many years to remember, sometimes disappearing long enough for the dwarf to think it had finally gone for good, only to return with a new surprise...a new test. And the "tests"...in no order of progression or difficulty. Sometimes a fight, sometimes someone in need of help. Sometimes hard or nearly impossible...but most often not. He knew the figure was a bloody elf of some sort, but it had never gotten close enough to speak to, yet followed the dwarf all over Norrath.</p>

<p align=left>"Damned bloody elf," the dwarf growled as he took another swig from the bottle. "Will I never get rid of you? You haunt my life and my dreams...what is it you want, damn the gods? What?!"</p>

<p align=left>After finishing the bottle in a series of quick gulps (And wincing at the explosion as the liquid landed in his gut), the dwarf settled himself against a nearby tree, his mind finally numb enough for sleep.</p>
