: I just added this information to the &quot;Various Changes&quot; section under &quot;Testinf For Next Update&quot;:

: A fix for mediation, that will prevent players from receiving improper “stopped meditating” messages.

: Players will be able to perform beneficial acts upon blue human NPC’s in Trammel.

: 
: Melantus
: Online Community Coordinator
: Ultima Online

: *** and I said:

: Why not be able to heal animals? 

: 
: How about me being able to heal the animal (not monster) I provoke on a monster just like a Tamer can heal their pet? In fact, If a Tamer is in my party I can heal their pet, but not my provoked animal. The animal I provoke on a monster is no different than the tamers pet in terms of the use we make of them. They are our friends and we don't want them to die. We want them to stay alive and help us fight.
