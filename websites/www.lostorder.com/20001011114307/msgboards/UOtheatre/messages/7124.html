: for that i have no answer        if we can start a campaign here... gather our ideas and present them to the new dev team   perhaps       i dont even think the new dev team knows that CBA exists

: i dont think that osi caved in on the taming issue     i think it was their plan along.... give them something totally awful   they will scream  make a counter offer    still awful, but better and it will appear to make them happy     
: its is still to drastic of a cut  and does nothing to fix the problems sage states are the problems they are trying to fix.... there will never be room at stables for pack horses cause miners will just fill them up, so just have it that they can be sold back, minus a  fee for renting the horse      simple and an entire profession does not have to be ruined
