<p align=left><b>Azyana's jounral, Entry Twenty One</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I am sitting here at the docks in Butcher Block waiting on the ship to take me to Freeport. I had hoped my golden one would be able to accompany me on the trip back but it seems we had just missed each other. I had heard of his arrival back home from one of the guards at the warrior guild.</p>

<p align=left>I am beginning to wonder if this will be the right choice for me to leave Unrest and make my way elsewhere. He told me that the experience in Unrest would help me learn so much and advance to a higher level of knowledge but it just does not seem to be that way for me.</p>

<p align=left>I think there are just to many clerics in Unrest. It has caused me frustration. I try to do what my golden one has told me when grouping with another cleric. Unless the fights are so tough that we both need to heal, if I am the junior cleric I should focus on healing since my other spells most likely will be resisted… that the older cleric should buff, root, stun, and cast against the undead. They being older will have more mana and will be more successful when casting against the undead, and their buffs will be stronger than mine, but they should of course still hold back some mana to heal if needed.</p>

<p align=left>I have grouped several times with other clerics. When I join a group I usually ask who is the main tank or puller of the group, if anyone has any buffs cast upon them and, if there is another cleric, ask how they want to split the clerical duties and just expect them to split it they way my golden one has told me. Most time they don't even say anything and I have to tell them what I will be doing and ask them to take care of the rest. I ask if they mind calling their heals and of course they say they don't mind. Then after awhile they seem to forget what was discussed and just go about as if they were the only cleric. This causes so many problems at times. I'll call a heal but then the other cleric will heal at the same time without saying a word and then a creature will attack one of us. If I am lucky there will be an attentive tank who will assist me when I say a creature is upon me but most time they seem to be too focused on fighting their initial foe.</p>

<p align=left>All too often I have seen another cleric in my group standing throughout the battle. This seems to go against another lesson… if you are standing you should be casting otherwise sit and meditate. This seems to be the reason I usually end a normal battle with 20-40 percent mana while another cleric will be OOM. When a battle is intense I usually call the percentage of my mana so that the group leader will know when to call a run to the zone. At the end of each battle I usually let them know how much mana I have remaining so that the puller will know how long our rest will be before our next battle. Sometimes I feel odd doing this since it seems the other clerics I have grouped with do not.</p>

<p align=left>There was this one cleric who joined us in the magi room. He was older so I asked him to take care of the casting of the protective spells. He did not cast spirit armor upon anyone. He said that it was too costly in mana. That is so odd since I think it would cause more mana to be used if he spent it all on healing. I just reminded him that I would be there to heal while he meditated. My golden one has told me that spending mana to prevent damage to the fighters is a good thing, that is why stuns are useful and why spirit armor and similar spells are worth casting in the down time between fights.</p>

<p align=left>I seem to have better luck healing as the only cleric in a group sometimes. I have kept full groups alive with hardly a problem. Well, unless someone does a horrendous pull. My golden one often speaks of his close companion Dearg and how they know each other so well and have come to heal their group almost as one. Perhaps some day I will be able to do that. Sometimes I think I forget that others have not had someone so knowledgeable as my golden one to teach them the ways of being a good cleric.</p>

<p align=left>When I reach the next circles of spells I will have Greater Healing in addition to my normal healing so I will have to learn how to balance between the two to heal my group most efficiently. But that is a long ways off as I am still struggling to get to 20.</p>

<p align=left>I can see the boat approaching. I feel so torn as I want to see my golden one but I know I must leave to make progress so that I may eventually do battle by his side. I hope he knows how much I have missed him. It's here.</p>
