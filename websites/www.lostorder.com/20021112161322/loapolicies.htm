            and work together to list the pro's and con's of a given decision. 
            After weighing the options and possible results, a final decision 
            is made and the policy is enacted. With a guild of 150+ members, people 
            will both agree and disagree with the new rules or policies. We ask 
            that all members do their best to accept and adhere to the new rules, 
            knowing that we did our best for the GUILD overall, as opposed to 
            a select group or chapter of members. We always strive to do things

              </font>One of the greatest things about LOA, in my opinion, is the 
              friendship and networking that takes place amongst our members. 
              With over 150 members from around the world, you are most likely 
              going to meet people who share MANY of your interests - be it gaming, 
              music, movies, books, poetry or &lt;insert things here&gt;. We try 
              to hold &quot;Getting to Know You&quot; mailing list events every 
              6 months or so. This is an effort to introduce our members to each 
              other and hopefully spark some dialogue between each other</b>.</font></p>

              members often hold large-scale (or small-scale) gatherings in real 
              life. Some of our members have helped other members through difficult, 
              emotional times (i.e. loss of job, divorce, financial problems, 
              etc.). Some of our members have helped others get jobs in various 
              industries (i.e. computer, gaming, etc.). Some of our members are 
              friends with famous people, or people with connections. This can 
              lead to unexpected things like free MLB (baseball) games, concert 
              tickets, opera, etc. Respecting fellow members can lead to interesting 
              friendships that will last a lifetime.</b></font></font></p>
