<p align=left><b>Evil Beaten Back</b><br><i>by Guilbert</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>My friends and brethren of the Lost Order of Akalabeth,</p>

<p align=left>I pray that this letter finds each of you in good health. I write to you today to tell you all of a great victory for the Lost Order! Wherever in the land we see evil triumphing over the common man, it is our calling to right that wrong, and yesterday the Lost Order of Akalabeth assembled a mighty force to do just that!</p>

<p align=left>After our lord, Karas-Zan, Sho Governor, held his meeting for Initiates and Commoners of the Order, many brave and noble members assembled outside the library at Cragstone to answer a humble herder's cry for help. You may recall the message on the subject that I wrote here yesterday, telling how this man and his family had been run out of their home by a group of vile Banderlings. Those touched by his tale included Li Muer, Katana Moonblade, Kelsam, Taishi Kirin, Baltazir, Alerian Aelmandred, Wyll Walaran, Zux Trebtsun, and probably one to whom I am overlooking as I write this. </p>

<p align=left>Traveling as a group (and what a mighty train it must have seemed to passers-by and local folk!), we made our way across the fields and rolling pastures west of Cragstone for some distance until we found ourselves at the outskirts of Belwyn Varsee's ranch. From within the house could be clearly heard the raucous sounds of Banderlings howling insanely after their triumph. With little regard for the well-built home they had stolen, they broke into crates of supplies and fought amonst themselves over the bits of pyreal stolen from under the house's hearth stone.</p>

<p align=left>After only a moment to gather into a tight group, the Order's warriors, monks, and mages strode into the house and were met by a knot of Banderlings in the main room, scouts, guards, and their youth. With a cry, the beasts dropped what they were doing and lept at us, since killing and maiming is for them better than mere theft and vandalism. But our ranks never parted, and the crowd of Banderlings was soon nothing but a tangle of broken limbs and black blood.</p>

<p align=left>From upstairs, screams of rage could be heard, and Banderlings there threw open windows to call for their kin. As we moved up the stairs, Banderling raiders, sinewy and strong, threw themselves at us. We rushed in, hacking at their bandy legs and bathing them in baleful magics! At one point, a raider turned to me and clubbed me in the ear with his fist, sending me sprawling, blood running down my neck, and my head struck the fireplace stones. As my comrades rushed forward and destroyed the raider, I limped downstairs and out onto the green grass to collect my wits.</p>

<p align=left>Who should I find there, but our monarch, Tasslehof Windrunner! His Majesty bandaged my wounds and then supported us while we cleared the other buildings and the surrounding countryside. I was felled twice, once by another Banderling raider, and again by a mighty kick from a Blood Shreth, but the rest of the party stood firm! Our expedition was an unqualified success. We did honor to the Order, and defended an innocent family from further harm. They will have quite a mess to clean up when they return to their home, but they have a home which they thought they had lost forever. As for the Banderlings, they will think twice before returning! The beating we gave them will not soon be forgotten.</p>

<p align=left>I have just come from Cragstone, and the home of Belwyn Varsee's cousin, with whom he and his family have been staying. I am pleased to announce that he and his family are returning home, and that, somehow, the pyreals we recovered from the Banderling interlopers was more than he originally lost...he was very thankful for our help.</p>

<p align=left>I told him that such things are simply the way of the Lost Order of Akalabeth.</p>

<p align=left>In Service to the Lost Order, I sign this</p>
