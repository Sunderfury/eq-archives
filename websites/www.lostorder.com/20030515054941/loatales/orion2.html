<p align=left><b>From Orion's Journal, Entry Two</b><br><i>by Orion Red</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>There I was, standin' outside Samsur in the middle of the desert. Still hard to believe, but the rumors came true. A frozen storm unlike any other had come down upon the land, coverin' anythin' and everythin' with snow. Have to get meself some warmer gloves soon, cause me fingers be gettin' numb!</p>

<p align=left>Received a message from the monarch himself, somethin' 'bout a late hunt into the northern mountains. So off I went, runnin' up and down the snowy roads to Holtburg. Not sure how many people know our monarch, Tasslehof Windrunner, but I figure I should spread the word soon. Perhaps a warning would be better in his case. He might be one of the craziest blokes I've ever known.</p>

<p align=left>So meself, Joxer the Mighty, and Kelsam were called to duty, and gathered in Holtburg. Tasslehof told us of a place far away, way up in the mountains, and how that's where we was gonna hunt. I was too cold to argue at that point, so off we went. Gots to remember to warn the younger folk soon before they meet our devout monarch. Best think twice before joinin' him on some crazy journey into the mountain.</p>

<p align=left>Now I've been to some scary places, and been chased outta my share of taverns by wenches tryin' to club me, but I ain't never run fer me life like I did last night. Thar's some nasty beasts livin' up in them mountains. We were chased by some big monouga, and even bigger an' scarier tuskers. Seems we disturbed the tuskers in the middle of matin' season, cause both them male and female tuskers were none too happy to see us. Tass kept yellin' "keep runnin'!" so we did, and luckily them tuskers gave up chase after a while.</p>

<p align=left>Well, we finally found that place Tass was lookin' fer, some smelly cave in the middle of the mountain. So we equipped our crossbows, said our prayers, and in we went. And I thought the snowy mountains were scary! This place was even worse I tell ye. We followed Tass down the dark passages, and found an open area he called "the pit". More like the pit of death to me! There be corpses, rottin' flesh, broken swords, and blood everywhere! Tass tells us that them great mattekar be livin' in the cave, and to keep our eyes open. I ain't never seen one before, and I wasn't sure I wanted to see one either.</p>

<p align=left>Sure enough, we heard a loud roar and some humungous white beast jumps into the pit chasin' Kelsam around in circles. Next thing I know there be arrows and quarrels flying in all directions, and some crazy magi castin' wicked spells from the top of the pit. Before the mattekar beast was killed, another one appeared out of nowhere and ripped some poor warrior in half! I almost soiled me pants right then and there, but I somehow managed to keep shootin' quarrels at the beasts best I could. This carnage went on all night, as quite a few warriors and archers ran fer their lives, with some of them losin' a few body parts along the way.</p>

<p align=left>It was gettin' late, so Tass signaled us to leave as we ran down some passageway to one of them crazy portals. Darn portal dropped us off in the middle of nowhere, but it was better to be lost than still in that bloody cave. Well, we learned quite a few things about huntin' and hikin' through the mountains. And in the middle of all that bloody mayhem, I somehow managed to snag a quality hide from one of them mattekars. Reckon I'll find one of them leather crafters in town to make a new coat soon. Me patron's been awfully good to us lately, so I'll give it to him if he's interested. O'course, I still owe him fer bailin' me out of that little tavern incident down in Nanto.</p>
