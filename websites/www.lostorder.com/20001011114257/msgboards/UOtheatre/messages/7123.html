Even for these three skills, a GM in two gives a total of 200 points while a GM in three is 300 points, 1.5 times as many skills. Thus the effectiveness of Provocation would be 1.5 times as much for the Real Bard as compared to the twink. Further, if a Real Bard chooses to take Enticement, making 4 Bard skills, and somehow was able to GM those, then the Real Bard would be 2 times as successful at Provocation (and Peacemaking and Enticement) as the twink. This at least makes some purpose for Enticement. Not that I would take it anyway. I propose it be remover altogether instead. <p>Of course this idea would need some adjusting. First of all, make it possible for a Real Bard to GM some Bard skills. I still only have about 91 in Provocation and Peacemaking despite the fact that I have a GM in Musicianship. These other skills just are not moving above 90. <p>Second of all, either get rid of Enticement or make it useful, since we don't want the twink using an easy 70 points in it to make their Provocation better. <p>Or, perhaps only let the effect I describe come into play after a skill has, say 80 points in it. Thus no one would ever take Enticement for this or any other purpose. Just like now.<p>Virtues b' with ye all, me friends o' th' CBA!<br>Tal</font>
