<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Eighteen</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>What a nerve-wracking day. I met my love's mother. That feels good to write… my love. </p>

<p align=left>I was late awakening and then what happens first a Human needed assistance getting into Unrest to get his body so I invited him to join me and I gave him invisibility to the undead and asked him to follow me in. He was most appreciative but then I was late as it is. I gated back to Butcher Block. Just as I was beginning to run it started raining. What else could go wrong? I was late, all wet and still had to stop off at the bank so I wouldn't meet her in my sheer tunic. </p>

<p align=left>I finally get to Kaladim where, my love is waiting for me and I told him that I felt sick to my stomach. He gave me a reassuring kiss and told me I'd be just fine. I followed him to the bank where I took out my bronze breastplate. He went to check to see if his mother was ready and while he did I meditated to see if it would calm me down a bit. It didn't and then he came back and said it was time. My heart was beating so fast, my palms all sweaty….</p>

<p align=left>We entered his mother's home where she was seated and Hakadek said 'Mother, I would like you to meet Azyana'. We had just barely exchanged greeting when she lets out this gasp. Then asks me why I don't have a beard and that she only shorne hers in moruning for my dear husband. I thought 'great what a way to start'. She said she wanted proper grandchilderen. I just said 'Well, that would depend on my dear Hakadek no?' , then my love chimed in with 'And they shall be proper even so, there is no proof that this little problem will be passed on' then went on to say 'And I have come to regard it as less than nothing… I have enough beard for two of us'. </p>

<p align=left>His mother looked at me a little closer and her eyes filled with tears and only said 'Oh my. My love whispered to me that she must think that we were already married since I was wearing her ring. She asked him if it was true and he replied that it wasn't what she thought. She just said 'I hope the ring brings ye both more luck then it brought me an yer father' 'I have brought a bride, a Mother for your Grandchildren… to continue the family in honor of my Father, and aid him in his goals… she contined to cry softly and so he went on 'I have brought someone who's skills can ass to my own and will allow me to continue the search for my Father'</p>

<p align=left>All of a sudden she goes on about how I should be able to cook and to sew. Well, all I could think of to say was 'I plan to stand by his side when I am able.. to do battle with him…well when I am not tending to our children that is' Then she went on about having many strong grandchildren. I told her 'I will give them love as I give my love to Hakadek, buying what I can not make.' </p>

<p align=left>I think I will always remember the conversation that followed…</p>

<p align=left>Hakadek says, 'Have we your blessing to continue the search for my Father as a team … as Husband and Wife ?'<br>
Hakadek looks nervous.<br>
I tell her 'I give my heart an soul to him...'<br>
Hakadek says, 'With all my heart Mother'<br>
Hadana says, 'I can see she is smitten by ye very much'<br>
Hakadek holds Azyana's hand.<br>

Hadana says, 'Ye be a good wife for my son'<br>
Hadana beams a smile at Azyana.<br>
I say, 'I will for all times'<br>
Hakadek says, 'But fear not, our happiness shall not be at the cost of yours .'<br>
Hakadek says, 'We shall continue the search'<br>
Hadana says, 'I trust ye to find word of your father'<br>
Hadana says, 'Bring him home if ye can'<br>
Hadana says, 'Or clear his good name'<br>
Hadana says, 'So we may again wear it proudly.'<br>
Hakadek says, 'The hunt is long and with fortune we shall do both'<br>
Hadana says, 'Now you two go on your way'<br>
Hadana says, 'With my blessing to the match'<br>

I say, 'how many is many?'<br>

<p align=left>We were making our way back to where we were lodging and he asked me if it was so bad and I said yes it was because I thought she was going to hate me. He then asked me an odd question… would I still have him now after meeting his mother. What a silly question and I reassured him that I would always be with him. He went on to say that there was more I needed to know about his family, of his father. He told me he has written all down and I should read it and then decide again if I would still have him. He escorted me to my room and handed me the note kissing me good night. I took the note and kissed him good night and watched him go off to his room.</p>

<p align=left>I undressed and made my self comfortable to read this note. He seemed so concerned that my reading it may make me change my mind. My poor love having such a heavy weight on his shoulder to bear. I will do anything I can to assist him, but I'm afraid all I have to give him is my love. I hope that is enough. </p>
