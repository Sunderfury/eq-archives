<p align=left><b>Day Five</b><br><i>by Cyrssi</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Dear Elandel,</p>

<p align=left>I am growing quite weary of running from reavers and the occasional cyclops that people seem to bring to me. I think it is time I moved on and found a new place to hunt. I heard that Legasi and the others have gone back to the home continent to wreak havoc upon the aqua goblins of Dagnor's Cauldron. I think I might join them. I must run to catch that infernal boat to Kaladim. I shall write more when I get there...</p>

<p align=left>Ahh. I truly despise being on this thing. I am looking forward to getting my personal teleportation spells so tha I don't have to deal with this nonsense any longer. It is quite tedious. I think that I will go to Kelethin and look about a bit before I go to met with Legasi...</p>

<p align=left>I met Legasi and she has told me that others would be joining us. I'm all for it. The more the merrier. I gated to the hunting place and she is brought everyone else. The group consisted of me, Legasi, Baracus, Muerian, and Onstill. We hunted goblins of all sorts. The most difficult battle was the battle involving the tidal lords. Nasty little buggers. They managed to kill one, but another came after me and I ran to an encampment of fellows who gladly disposed of the beast. I narrowly escaped with my life, and I sat by their fire to heal and meditate. Speaking of meditating, I hear that it might be possible to no longer need this infernal spellbook to meditate when I am old enough. I shall love that day when it comes.</p>

<p align=left>We thought that securing a goblin camp might be a good way to go, and we set off for the nearest one. When we got there, only four goblins were present. Muerian lulled the mariners but failed to lull the bosun, and the bosun and tidal lord came after us. The tidal lord resisted my attempts to ignite him, which irritated me heavily. I was forced to rely on my morning star, which is a good weapon although my skill in using it seems a bit lacking. We were able to kill the bosun but were forced to run from the lord and the mariners, as they had firgured out what was going on. We lost Baracus for a bit, and the rest of us were able to get to safety.</p>

<p align=left>Muerian volunteered to help Baracus recover his belongings from the goblins. The rest of us waited at the aforementioned friendly camp. We were talking of going back to seek revenge upon the tidal lord when a horde of shamans and mariners came upon us. We all fought the good fight, but I'm afraid it wasn't quite good enough, as we lost Baracus and Legasi. We couldn't find Muerian. Onstill and I were able to kill the three shamans that were left even though we were both out of mana and fully relying on our weapons to do the job. We went again ot the camp to heal and meditate while waiting for the others to arrive, when we heard a cry of help from Muerian. It seems goblins really do not take a liking to bards. We were unable to get to him in time, and he was lost as well.</p>

<p align=left>As Onstill and I mediated and talked, the others made their way back to the encampment. Everyone recovered their belongings, and Onstill and Muerian decided to make camp fo rthe evening. Legasi, Baracus, and I headed for Kelethin to sell the bows the goblins had been dropping, and then Baracus parted from us to pursue some prey that was a little easier for him to manage. I made my way to my guildmaster to see if there was any news, and then headed to the bank. I remembered an errand I had to run, and told Legasi that I would like to hunt again in a couple days. She was happy to have the company and said she'd be around and that Orbison might be here as well.</p>

<p align=left>I went to the fletcher's and bought a kit and some cheap fletching parts and ran them to Kaladim, as the last time I had seen Dargo he had asked me if I might beable to help his sister Daraa begin fletching. I agreed that I would, so I found Daraa by the bank and gave her the items as Dargo requested. I was quite shocked to find out that she was a rogue, considering her big brother was a Lightbearer and a paladin and all. To ach his (or her) own, I guess. </p>

<p align=left>After my trip the Kaladim I returned to Kelethin and offered to bind and cast Spirit of Wolf on people. I accepted donations in the name of Tunare, but true to the ways of my uncles I did not ask for anything in return. I helped a few people who needed it, as well as Baracus; he seemed to have lost his belongings again and I wanted to be sure that he would be able to recover them. Shortly after that encounter, I decided to come back to the inn and rest.</p>

<p align=left>And that is where I am now. I must get my rest now, as it was a long and tiring day. I will be sure to write again soon. I hope that you are well and in good spirits, and that I shall soon see you again, for I miss you very much.</p>

<p align=left>May Tunare watch over us and protect us all.</p>

<p align=left>Goodnight, brother.</p>
