<p align=left><b>A Very Mary Wedding</b><br><i>by Mary</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>"Do you think the gold-leaf is too much?" She asked. </p>

<p align=left>Lichbane picked up the invitation and examined it closely. He smiled sentimentally at the gold embossed LOA symbol adorning the front. "I think it is perfect, my love. Just like you." He replied. </p>

<p align=left>Sister Calimaryn's eyes were bright with the love in her heart, as she kissed her betrothed sweetly. She has never been so happy. The day of the wedding was set and soon the world would share in the couple's happiness. Cali thought she might burst with excitement before the day arrived. Taking a deep breath the expectant bride calmed herself and went over the checklist again in her mind: 'The place was set, the cake was ordered, her dress was hanging in the closet next to Lichbane's suit, the bridal party was picked and their wardrobe ordered as well, and now the invitations have been chosen she thought.' The next logical step was to make the guest list and send them out. </p>

<p align=left>"Well since we have decided, help me to formulate the guest list. I would just die if I over looked inviting one of our friends, in my delirium." She smiled and kissed his cheek.</p>

<p align=left>The groom sat down and started going through all his comrades in his mind. "It goes without saying all our Lost Order kin shall be invited. But what of our friends and acquaintances from outside our clan?" He asked. </p>

<p align=left>"I suppose we should invite select members of the Order of the Ebon Skull. I mean since Tara is my bride's maid and she herself is labeled Shadow now." Sister Calimaryn frowned at this admission and Lichbane squeezed her hand comfortingly. </p>

<p align=left>"Labels matter not my love. 'Tis our day and we shall invite whom we please. What of the others in the Shadows, should we perhaps invite them all?" He asked thoughtfully. </p>

<p align=left>Cali considered for a moment trying to recall the members who had succumbed to the Shadow's influence, writing them down as they came to her mind. "Lets see… There is Tara of course, Yarp the Never, Caerdin, Velaska, Vem, …uh…who else? Oh, and the strange woman that thinks she is a child… what is her name? Mary! Cross-eyed Mary they call her." </p>

<p align=left>Brother Lichbane and Sister Calimaryn both looked at the last name she had written: Cross-eyed Mary.</p> 

<hr width=600 align=center color="#24090E">

<p align=left>The day of the wedding had finally arrived and the stage was set. The guests were seated and the shrine looked lovely. Everyone waited patiently to witness the entrance of the bride. Everyone, that is except for the groom. Lichbane stood before the altar praying reverently that the guests cold not hear the pounding of his heart - for he could hear nothing else. </p>

<p align=left>After what seemed to him and endless parade of bride's maids and attendants (there being only three in actual total), there at last was the flower girl heralding the coming of the bride. Lichbane had only a moment to contemplate their choice of this participant before Mary started her walk down the isle with her flower basket in hand. The woman-child performed flawlessly dropping flower petals with each step in perfect sync with the music. Lichbane did not understand the strange look of distaste that appeared on the guest's faces as she past by. Then the girl neared the rest of the wedding party, a vile smell assaulted his nose and he thought he might faint. The dazed groom looked down the isle in utter incomprehension at the blossoms littering the runway. Nightshade wrapped in Garlic flowers (some with the garlic bulbs still attached), were mixed together with the Rose petals. The foul buds let off a sickening and putrid stench. The wedding guests turned away from the entrance ramp covering their abused noses with their hands. Lichbane would have taken the girl by the throat and strangled her straight away but his eyes were to watery to even see clearly. </p>

<p align=left>Suddenly, like some glorious knight of old, one of the guests leapt from his seat, ran down the isle gathering the offensive blooms in his arms and transported them from the scene. Mary's eyes lit with recognition then a confused look crossed her face.</p>

<p align=left>"Mr. Red Man! But…those are for the pretty lady Cali to walk on Mr. Red Man. Me will pick you some flowers of you own. Please don't take the pretty lady's." Mary pleaded. </p>

<p align=left>Sir Galventine motioned for Mary to be silent. "It's alright princess, I am just gathering them up to put them in water for Sister Cali. We don't want them to die." Galventine explained. </p>

<p align=left>Mary nodded, putting her finger to her lips remembering she was not suppose to speak while acting as the flower girl. Sir Galventine smiled at the girl reassuringly and returned to his seat amongst the other guests. </p>

<p align=left>When all was silent once again the organist began to play the bride's song and Sister Calimaryn appeared angel like at the back of the hall. A more beautiful bride has never lived. The woman positively glowed with radiance. Her gown was a lovely shade of pastel pink, adorned with a layer of fine gossamer, and sprayed with actual pixie dust. It glistened angelically in the candle light as Sister Calimaryn seemed to glide not walk down the isle. The train of the gown followed out behind the bride in waves adding a magical quality to the scene. The guests all stood in respect for the lady of honor. Hushed comments on her beauty rippled through the crowd. Lichbane felt his heart jump to his throat at the sight of this goddess that is to be his wife. His eyes teared up again and this time there was ne'er a garlic bulb in sight. </p>

<p align=left>Sister Calimaryn took her place beside her groom and the priest opened his mouth to speak. "I would like to introduce myself and say a few words on the bonds of holy matrimony. I am Father Abraham, a humble healer. I am a member of wandering healers of 'The Sacred Avater' church of Britian. I am honored to be here…" </p>

<p align=left>Mary listened intently to the monk's introduction but at the mention of 'wandering healers' the girl's face went blank. Without warning Mary's eyes cleared and a joyous smile crossed her face.</p>

<p align=left>"Hail and well met good citizens!" Mary shouted to the assembly. "I am Father Amos. I see I have arrived just in time for the wedding. I am honored this lovely couple have chosen me to preside over the ceremony." The girl concluded. </p>

<p align=left>The guests murmured in confusion as the wedding party stood watching with their mouths agape in helpless shock. Father Abraham fell silent unsure now as how to proceed. Lichbane's face grew red with rage and Sister Calimaryn gasped beneath her veil, thankful for the privacy it provided her. Once again Sir Galventine rose from his seat to save the day but this time Lady Tara was to quick for him. Tara had come prepared just for such an incident. Thinking quickly, she reached into the folds of her gown and brought forth a small toy boat. She smiled pleasantly and placed the toy in the girl's hands. Mary accepted the gift looking down at it perplexed. </p>

<p align=left>"Milady…whatever shall I do with this child's toy?...er…toy…uh…" Her words faded away softly as again Mary's face went blank. </p>

<p align=left>Then as before, Mary's eyes cleared as she looked at the toy in her hands. Mary looked around, all eyes were upon her and she felt very scared and confused. She looked to Tara for guidance. </p>

<p align=left>"Everything is fine dear. Would you mind holding this for me until after the wedding?" Tara whispered. </p>

<p align=left>Mary looked at Tara relieved and nodded her affirmative. Tara smiled and turned to the priest. Speaking so that only Father Abraham could hear she said…</p>

<p align=left>"Father, please proceed with the ceremony but I implore thee to refrain from mentioning those of your order or the healing profession again."</p>

<p align=left>Father Abraham nodded vigorously still eyeing Mary fearfully. He started again with the more traditional 'Dearly beloved' and ended sometime later with 'You may kiss the bride.' Mary was silent for the remainder of the ritual.</p>

<p align=left>Lifting the veil gently, Lichbane leaned forward, taking his beautiful bride into his arms and kissed her deeply. Mary being positioned directly behind the bride could not see what was taking place. Squirming for a better perspective the child took a step to the right, just catching the hem of the bride's gown. There was a loud ripping sound as the delicate material separated from the seams. Everyone watched in horrid fascination as the frilly garment pealed from Sister Calimaryn's body and fell lightly to the floor. Father Abraham quickly averted his gaze. Brother Lichbane appraised his half nude bride with satisfaction as the crowd grew silent in awe. Sister Cali composed herself almost instantly, laughed and stepped eloquently out of the pile of fabric at her feet. </p>

<p align=left>"Well, I have never been known as a woman to over dress." She said smiling to the crowd not the least bit embarrassed by her unclothed state. </p>

<p align=left>The guests roared with laughter, applauding her good-natured response. Cali took a kilt offered her from one of the guests, coincidentally enough it matched the lace bustier she was wearing under her gown perfectly. Kissing her beloved once again, she then turned and led the crowd to the reception area for refreshments. </p>

<p align=left>"Alright girls gather round. Its time to try for the bouquet." Cali called out. </p>

<p align=left>All the eligible women present formed a tight unit anxiously awaiting the toss. Who would be the next to wed? The tension mounted as the bride turned her back to the group. Every maid watched intently, visions of matrimony running through their heads. Calimaryn cocked her arm and let go the bouquet with glee. The flowers arched beautifully suspended above the gang of hopeful women. Then suddenly a lone figure fought her way to the center of the crowd, pushing and shoving for a more advantageous position. The women froze as time stood still. The lone figure launched herself Olympian like into the air, snatching the matrimonial symbol from the waiting hands of the intended recipient. Running out of the crowd yelling with child like innocence. </p>

<p align=left>"Me wins! Me wins! I catched the flowers!"</p>

<p align=left>The maidens stared in disbelief at the bouquet in Mary's hands. The women sighed in unison. Down heartened and broken they returned to the reception area. </p>

<p align=left>The festivities were over now. The cake had been cut and eaten, the gifts were open, the bride kissed and the groom congratulated. The guests gathered outside for the departure. The carriage was waiting to whisk the happy couple away to the honeymoon suite. Tara moved through the crowd passing out small packets of rice to throw. When she arrived at Mary she saw the girl held a rice bag tied with a blue, lace bow. </p>

<p align=left>"Me got some Tara lady." Mary said lifting her bag for Tara to see. Tara nodded and watched as the couple exited the shrine, running the gauntlet of guests. The air was instantly filled with a shower of rice falling on the newlyweds from every direction. Tara threw her handful theatrically and looked in time to see Mary do the same. Tara paused a moment and peered closer at the bag in Mary's hands. It must be my imagination she thought. She could swear she saw the rice in Mary's bag move. </p>

<p align=left>"Mary childe, where did you get that rice?" Tara asked.</p>

<p align=left>Mary looked at Tara. Her brows coming together in a puzzled expression. "Rice…? Me suppose to throw rice?" The girl asked dumbfounded. "Me thought you said L-I-C-E." </p>

<hr width=600 align=center color="#24090E">

<p align=left>Sister Calimaryn and Brother Lichbane awoke from their daydreams almost simultaneously. They looked at each other a moment in revolted silence. They nodded to one another in mute agreement and Cali quickly crossed the name Mary off the invitation list. </p>

<p align=left>"So…Azalin, Lucus, Leshrac. What about that nice man we met at Hyloth?" Cali inquired.</p>

<p align=left>"He was a murderer, my love." Lichbane remarked.</p>

<p align=left>"True, but at least he is sane." Cali replied.</p>
