<p align=left><b>Edge of Madness</b><br><i>by Bentley</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Once again another day had past and I spent the entire day staring into the fire in the fireplace. I kept asking myself what is wrong with me….why did my memory seemed so mixed up. Everyone I see speaks to me yet I feel like they are strangers. Why is it when I close my eyes and dream I always see another life and another place than here? I jumped as Reminisence placed her hand on my shoulder since I was lost in my thoughts I did not notice she was behind me. I looked at her and smiled. Remi said, “ Dear what is wrong with you lately….I am very worried about you ….you have not been acting like yourself lately.” I told her, “ Don’t worry my love …I am just worried about the baby and all…it will pass.” I just prayed that she could not tell I was lying to her…. something was wrong very wrong I just did not know what it was.</p>

<p align=left>One thing I felt for sure that somehow my cousin Stephen LeClaire has something to do with my strange feelings and perhaps my memory loss. Every time he is near I feel as if I am bonded to him in some strange way. Too many questions are running through my mind…perhaps I am going mad. But if I am mad then why do my boots no longer fit and why the sunlight burns my flesh if I am out for longer than a few moments. It almost feels as if I had been placed into someone else’s life.</p>

<p align=left>I left my thoughts for a moment and looked at Remi. She was so pretty all dressed up and wanting to go into the village to shop some and to stop by the Brewman’s tavern. Perhaps a trip into the village will take my mind off of things for a while.</p>
