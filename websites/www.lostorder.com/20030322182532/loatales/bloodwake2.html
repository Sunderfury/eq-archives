<p align=left><b>Return of the Bloodwake, Part II</b><br><i>by Killer</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A dark smile crept along Killer's face watching the hysterical actions of the fleetmaster, with grim satisfaction.  From the treeline upon his faithful steed from hell, the Death Knight watched the futile attempts of resurrection by the Captain of Akalabeth, Enosh Flam.</p>

<p align=left>What the foolish mortal did not understand, was that the maiden he was trying to save, was in fact the Harbinger of Death Gloomshade in disguise. For months the necromancers, under the watchful eye of the Daemonic tutor, have been researching a new spell that involved illusions and feeblemindedness that corrupted the mind and will of the victim.</p>

<p align=left>Although the Death Knight had his doubts, he was in fact surprised of the spell's power to travel across the shard.  This subject Enosh Flam has been under several experiments and spells in the past that caused his old ship to be sunk and the captain marooned on several islands, injured and starving as the wraiths whispered nightmares in his sleep.  It took weeks until the obscurity spell wore off and his comrades were able to find and rescue him.</p>

<p align=left>Killer continued to watch as the pathetic worm finally collected himself and carried the "maiden" into the newly constructed Navel Academy.  The illusion would work without fail if the horny daemonic tutor could keep his hands to himself, as the real maiden was held in captivity in the depths of Golgotha's dungeons.  The wench must be kept alive within the pentagram, as it was very difficult to locate someone that was intimate with the subject. </p>

<p align=left>A weak manifestation appeared beside Killer.  Killer raised a eyebrow as the new wraith Leshrac was having difficulty maintaining his manifestation.</p>

<p align=left>"All continues with the plan master?" groaned the wraith with a voice from beyond the grave.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye shade.  Go inform the council that all goes according to plan."</p>

<p align=left>"As you command." hissed the disappearing wraith with strained relief as he let his manifestation go.</p>

<p align=left>The Harbinger would do well, Killer thought.  Infiltrating the Akalabeth order and prying into the captains emotions from the past, and slowly sending him into insanity.</p>

<p align=left>A noxious odor interrupted Killer's thoughts, as Dissident nudged his nightmare next to Killer.</p>

<p align=left>"Is it time master?" croaked Dissident.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye it is.  Now we ride onto Everlight to give the Admiral some fun with the resurrection of Baert the Black."</p>

<p align=left>"And what of the Akalabeth regatta?" rasped Dissident.</p>

<p align=left>Killer smirked.  "The necromancers Bal-Anon Dak and Pandora the Fallen have retrieved the original Bloodwake from the depths of the ocean. Mesostopheles summoned the crew from their watery grave, and their tormented souls will never tire.  The ambush will go off as planned with the Ship of the Dammed."</p>

<p align=left>The birds flew from their trees as the pair of Death Knights cackled hysterically as they rode their nightmares across the planes leaving behind a fiery trail.</p>
