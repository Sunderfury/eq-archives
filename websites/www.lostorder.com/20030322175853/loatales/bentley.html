<p align=left><b>A Doomed Soul</b><br><i>by Bentley</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>All hope is gone…. I am doomed…raced through Bentley's mind as he thought about last night's events. The night started out as planned with Feanor's help he was able to bring Maria out of the child Mary to face his master for one last time. Convincing his master that he needed to complete the blood bond between them she gave him a vial of her blood. Bentley safely placed the vial in his pack to be given later to the one that would break Maria's hold on him. All seemed well in the tavern, Mary went to draw Sarah a picture when Sir Galventine appeared. </p>

<p align=left>Galv asked Mary how she had been and if anyone had caused her any trouble or acted strange. Mary looked at Bentley. I told Mary "go ahead dear you can answer him"…that was my mistake. Mary then told Galv how Feanor and I lied to her about her mother…I attempted to explain to Galv that I needed to do that to speak to Maria. Galv all of a sudden took ill. He collapsed to the floor with blood coming form his eyes and ears. Feanor and I rushed to his side to heal him…but we were unable. What happened next was mostly a blur to me…He somehow changed before my very eyes…he became a demon. He knocked me to the ground…. In my fear I grabbed the child Mary to keep her from harm. He then tore her from my arms…shredding the flesh on my arms. I leaped toward him only to end up on the floor unconscious. When I awoke, I noticed that several of my ribs had been broken. I asked Feanor to go to my bag and check the vial, since my bag was knock to the ground during the struggle with Galv. The look of horror on Feanor's face said it all…the vial was cracked and blood was dripping out. I ran over to Feanor as fast as I could and placed the vial into a empty mug…praying that it would be enough blood to free me from slavery. About that time Galv appeared and broke the mug. In a rage, I attacked him once more taking the dagger I had hidden in my right boot and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck. Galv tossed me against the wall like a rag doll, breaking my hand as he took the dagger out of it. He then bit the dagger in half and laughed at me. I laid on the floor a broken man…not only in body but also in soul. With all of the strength I had left I crawled over to the child Mary. Maria would be the only one to save me now. I hit Mary several times until Maria appeared. Maria once again saved my life; she cut her wrist and feed me while she healed my wounds. By taking her blood this last time I am now bonded to her forever as her slave.</p>

<p align=left>Now was the time for me to accept what I have become and on her order I took my first victim. I walked up to Daisy and smiled at her. Slowly I put my arms around her and kissed her on her neck. I felt my fangs grow and then I plunged them into her neck…. Holding tightly to her body I felt her try to pull away. The glorious sensation that came next can not be described unless you have felt the life force drain from one and into your own body. I quickly became intoxicated with the power and warmth that her blood had. I had never felt such power before. With each beat of her heart the warm blood flowed into my mouth and throughout my body. I finally became lightheaded …perhaps I fed too quickly. I dropped her body to the floor. Maria smiled and I knew I was not a failure any more.</p>

<p align=left>After sometime had passed Daisy began to move a strange light surrounded her…. She was not dead. I was frightened, but Maria was not mad at me…. She understood that I have taken my first step into the darkness of my own free will.</p>
