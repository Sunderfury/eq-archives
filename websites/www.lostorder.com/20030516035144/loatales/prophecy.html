<p align=left><b>Prophecy</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Timely fears across a baneful sea drift aimless and outward. Drafted
from the abyss of deep waters rises tides of aspect most terrible.
Carved bloody from obsidian form. Cast forth silent amidst the din of
foolish prophets.</p>

<p align=left>These choices made, stained with falsehoods. Philosophies of order
disordered and destroyed.</p>

<p align=left>We choose not the sleeping death of passions frozen cold
by restriction that serve but one Listless Brute.</p>

<p align=left>Fools in noble garb serving the platitudes of decadence lain
soft in bedding woven smooth by silken hands of complicit nature.
This fate chosen by a Broken Tyrant shall also not be ours.</p>

<p align=left>Our future will now begin. The shadows will live, the secrets made flesh.</p>

<p align=left>Drink deep the beautiful torments that order will suffer. Gorge
thineselves on the feast that bountiful chaos will spawn.</p>

<p align=left>Sink slowly into the whirlpool. Inhale the only freedom thou
wilt ever truly know.</p>

<p align=left>--THE ZOG CABAL—</p>

<hr width=600 align=center color="#24090E">

<p align=left>This evil prophecy has weighed heavily upon my soul since I first read these words.  I can not sit buy idle and watch one so evil corrupt my beloved sea.  I resolved to patrol the southern seas, searching for signs of this vile Cabal's corruption.  Much to my dismay I did not need look long for signs of some form of evil magics.</p>

<p align=left>As I sailed the seas heading west from Jhelom a thick fog descended upon the ocean.  T'was thick as soup and so dense I could not see the bow of my ship from her stern.  The air had the rank odor of foul black magics.  Soon the winds settled to a deathly calm.  Even the ocean currents failed me, leaving the Intrepid dead in the water.</p>

<p align=left>I though of abandoning my ship by means of magical transportation, then chastised myself for being so cowardly.  I resolved to get a fix on my position.  However I found my compass needle spinning aimlessly.  Also the fog was far too think to attempt to use my sextant.</p>

<p align=left>I resolved myself to stay with my ship and attempt to seek the source of this evil mist, but alas my ship would not move, and none of the magics I summoned could clear the fog enough to see.  After what seemed an eternity of trying to scry through the mist I collapsed exhausted on the deck of the Intrepid.  I awoke some time later to find the mist lift away just as quickly as it had fallen upon me.  Once it had left, the wind returned.</p>

<p align=left>I don't know how long I was trapped by that evil mist, it could have been minutes or it could have been years.  Time seemed to race forward and stand still all at once.  Once the mist cleared, revealing the star speckled night sky, I could take a bearing with my sextant.  I found myself far north of where I was originally, many leagues from where I first encountered the evil mist.  </p>

<p align=left>Relieved to be free of that horrible mist I set sail for Yew, wondering how long I had really been gone. I then caught a glimps of my reflection in the water. Startled I stopped and looked more closely. I had grown old, my now white hair and wrinkled face belonged to a man almost twice my age. I resumed my course and hurried to Yew, wondering what had become of my friends, thinking I had been gone for many years. Much to my pleasure and bewilderment I arrived in Yew just in time for the celebration with the Moores.</p>

<p align=left>I know not how the foul magics of that evil fog managed to age me so, but soon I will seek out the wisdom of mages of Moonglow. I hope that they will have a cure for the hex that has been placed upon me. If they can not help I shall seek the aid of the mysterious red robed magi. If anyone in the realm has the power to un work sure terrible magic, they would.</p>
