<p align=left><b>The Passing of Onstill Drastill Tur'Lkwig</b><br><i>by Onstill</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>As he walked down the hall he began to wonder,"What will happen." Onstill
looked passionatly at the Hall of Akalabeth. Noone was here now it being too
late and the wrong time of week. The pictures of Brimstone, Freejack, Knight
Ventrue, Unforgiven, Maraximus Moor, Stubby, Kelsam, Brewman and many others
littering the walls with pictures of battles and dungeons long fought and
conqured. The he reached one picture that was perticularly special to him.
It was a picture of him and Gradishar laughing at a large group of orcs that
seemed to keeping appearing in cages.... Onstill drifted off......</p>


<p align=left>Onstill..... Onstill.... ONSTILL.... Onstill turned around. Kelsam was
pounding him on the shoulder. "Whats going on." Kelsam asked quite annoyed.
"Oh nothing..." Onstill trailed off. Kelsam knew something was up Onstill
never just sat around the hall. "I've found something," Onstill said at
last. "Oh whats that," Kelsam said almost quizically. "Actually I didn't
find it Llitsno did." he said. "Ah yes the ever studying Wizard, what has he
conjured up this time." said Kelsam getting interested. "Well you know that
since my fathers death(see Onstill's Bio) I've been trying to find a way
back to that land, I love the Lost Order and in that time I've grown fond of
these hall and made many friends and enemy's." "Your going somewhere with
this," said Kelsam wistfully. "Yes Llitsno has found a spell and believes
that it may open a portal back to our fathers world. But this gate.... It
reminds me of the one described of in the tales of the Avatar. Lord British
himself helped Llitsno with the final computations of the spell. It is
called the Gate of Darkness in the Avatars tales. I wonder if it might lead
home or somewhere worse. But I must try if i might mean finding my true
heratige and at worst I shall take with me a piece of the shard and spread
the tales of the Lost Order of Akalabeth." There was a long pause.... "I
trust that things will go well with you Onstill and I hope that godspeed be
with you on your journey."</p>


<p align=left>Onstill approached the clearing several were present. First Onstill went to
Jade. "Lady Jade you have been a insperation and a guide to me in times of
darkness and light for you I leave this." Onstill began a spell as colors
weaved and waned between his hands. A moment later a single white rose
appeared. This is for you a token of everlasting friendship and being
enchanted as such it will allow you free communication with me at will
mearly think of me and I will be there. Next Onstill stepped up to
Gabrielle. "You did start it. Hehe I've learned much from our wrestling
matches and Consider you like a sister to me that I can talk to on any
matter of personal or stately matter." Onstill pulled out a pen and quill.
"This is also magic with it your words will be like magic causing your
hearts desire to come to pass." Next Onstill walked up to Stubby. "Friend
you are probably the most devoted person I have ever seen." Onstill handed
Stubby a piece of paper it read "One free pass for the weekend to la la
land". "Use it well." Lastly Onstill walked up to Kelsam and Gradishar.
"Kelsam take all I have in the bank and make use of it as you see fit I
trust you." Onstill hugged Kelsam then looked at Gradishar. "Mellon I give
to you this stone it is the same as carried by Lord British and The Avatar
don't ask how I got it I just did with it you may learn to go to many worlds
may one of them be mine."</p>

<p align=left>Onstill, Llitsno, and StillSquire walked to the center of the clearing.
Llitsno began to chant words strange to even the most gifted Magicians
present. Kes Tral Lot Sol Ter Cal Fer Pon Por. A large black gate opened
before the 3 men and they covered their eyes. The gate shimmered like a
black hole making noises that were strange and unlike any portal others had
seen. Onstill, Stillsquire then Llitsno stepped through the gate. Unnoticed
in the light a shadowed figure followed them through just as the gate began
to close. Jade rested on her sword and looked at the rose...............</p>


<p align=left>Onstill appeared in a dark forest in some kind of tree city.....</p>

<p align=left>Llitsno appeared in a dark cavern surrounded by people with black skin apon
looking at himself found his magics shrunk and his skin a similar color.</p>

<p align=left>Stillsquire appeared in a normal enough city but felt strangly changed as if
his body were stronger and more agile.</p>

<p align=left>The Shadowed figure................</p>
