<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk
stared stoically into the dancing flames. He felt the heat from the blaze on his face
&#150; an odd contrast to the icy chill of the winter wind. The fire seemed alive to him,
as if a living being had been summoned out of dry kindling. With their hissing and
crackling, the flames spoke to him, in a language older than words.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Nearby, Bolgar
fidgeted uncomfortably. It was getting dark, and the frozen wastes are a dangerous place
to be after the sun has fallen. It would not be long before the wolves started to hunt
&#150; and there were worse things than wolves out here. He knew better to disturb
Greyhawk, though. He did not understand these vision quests, but he knew that they
required a lot of concentration.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He had agreed to
accompany his older brother out into the plains of Everfrost, but the truth was that he
would rather have stayed home. Bolgar was a simple man. He liked to believe that the world
was a simple place. He did not like mysteries, nor magic. He preferred to deal with real
things, things he could see and touch. When he first learned that Greyhawk had chosen the
path of the Shaman, he was filled with dismay. Why chase after ghosts and visions? Was it
not enough to lead a simple life?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">When at last Greyhawk
stirred and rose, Bolgar breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;What did you see?&quot; he
asked.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Darkness.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bolgar laughed.
&quot;I can see darkness. It is night, now. I don&#146;t need to stare into a fire for an
hour to see it.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk shook his
head. &quot;You do not understand. I saw a world of darkness. A world covered forever with
night. Our world.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bolgar shivered.
&quot;That makes no sense. The sun will come up tomorrow. You can bet your last copper on
it. Tomorrow, there will be sun.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye, perhaps
tomorrow. And perhaps the day after that. But there is a great darkness coming, a darkness
which will end all light.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;If that is
true&#133;and I do not think it is&#133;then we will need many torches.&quot;</font></font></p>
