This is not true. We had a bug this morning (one of the bugs that was fixed in the rolling patch) that resulted in sometimes random damages on monsters that were resistant/vulnerable to spell damage (this was the same bug that caused reistances not to print in your resistances window). So, earlier today, you could have easily seen a situation where you did less damage to a monster than in previous versions, but that was fixed. If it is still happening, it is a bug, not an intended damage reduction. Our intent was to raise spell damage (via resistence debuffs), not reduce it. <br><p><font color="red" size="-2"><i>reported by Joxer</i></font></font></font>

The Stormcrows, STC and Akalabeth met in Cornwall to destroy the hordes of Greater Boogeys. Akalabeth hosted this event, which was aimed at giving our lower level members (20+) a chance to fight tougher creatures, gain nice experience and build the bonds of friendship amongst our guilds. A few people managed to level, and the number of deaths were minimal to our three full groups. <br><p>We were lucky enough to have Chao (Akalabeth) with us. He is a 40+ level cleric who remained in the area, offering buffs, heals and ressurections (as needed). Also, Chao was the one who rounded up the boogeys and brought them to us in waves. It was wonderful for our low level group, and incredibly kind of him to donate his time in helping US. I am sure Chao received NO experience points for his 2 to 3 hours of babysitting. :)<br><p>Events like this will make our Initiative, and our alliance, that much stronger. At the end of the night, we were friends and all very thankful of each others time. I hope to have more of these events for our alliance guilds. Thanks again, everyone!</font></font>
