<p align=left><b>Fall of the Ghoul Lord</b><br><i>by Sunmoon Solusterra</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Walterus turned to look at his companions. His face looked dark as he peered over the bloodstained floor, the crimson tainted room seemingly drowning all light. He could barely make out his friends sitting by the entrance to the room of the Ghoul Lord.</p>

<p align=left>Ailill, the fierce Elven warrior lass, stood ready at the front of the group. Her luminous crafted armor could not be dampened by the gloom. Yet, her strange silence hid and unbridled fury hidden in her blades she wielded.</p>

<p align=left>Dalyn, the jovial Ranger sat by her side, putting the finishing touches on a quick sharpening of his dirk. Often the Ranger would open his mouth to have the rest of the party chuckling softly. One quick glance at his waist revealed the Flowing Black Silk Sash that so quickened his already swift strikes. He had just claimed the bounty only days earlier in another adventure filled eve.</p>

<p align=left>Next to him sat his younger friend Sunmoon. He had thought himself a bit young to be fighting this deep in the pits of Guk, but his friends thought otherwise. One of the departing members had made his skin tingle as a protection to the vision of the undead and escorted him quickly and silently to this dark place.</p>

<p align=left>Silently mediating near the rear were the two dwarven clerics Hakadek and Dearg. Their powers were unmatched in this portion of the dungeon. Each not only had the power to heal immense wounds, but the ability to smite the undead with powerful spells given to them by Brell.</p>

<p align=left>Now silent, all of these eyes peered through the gloom and watched the brave Dwarven warrior stand boldly at the base of the throne. Walterus had volunteered to take the brunt of the Ghoul Lord's fury and more importantly his devasting Harm touch with its crippling damage.</p>

<p align=left>"He has come!" shouted Walterus. Everone sprang to their feet and watched Walterus wither at the first touch. The clerics rushed to his aid as Walterus swung his axe mightily at the demented Frog. Quickly, the rest of the band of friends surrounded the beast and rained blows on it from every direction.</p>

<p align=left>The battle looked to be long and furious as this was one of the toughest creatures in Norrath. All told, 6 blades and one very large axe assailed the creature. Walterus kept screaming taunts and insults at the beast to keep its attention focused on him. Then, as he would look near death, the mighty clerics would restore him anew.</p>

<p align=left>Gradually, the battle wore on. Luckily the party had already dispatched his henchmen in the room so they could not assist. With the fighters looking weary and the clerics looking low on their mental energy, Dalyn called for the snaring roots and with Tunare's blessing they held the frogs feet fast as he turned to run, obviously bested in this battle.</p>

<p align=left>With their last effort, the clerics issued arcane words to smite the beast and he fell as sighs of relief came from the worn party.</p>

<p align=left>Walterus bent over the corpse and looked through its belongings... " A Ysheka!" he exclaimed. Quickly the party went over and marvelled at the blade. After a few moments of discussion it was decided that Ailill would wield this mighty weapon. </p>

<p align=left>You could hear small prayers uttered to the Gods as the party sat to mend its wounds... and wait for the evil to return.
