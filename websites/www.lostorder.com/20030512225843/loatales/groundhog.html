<p align=left><b>Guardian Lichbane's Groundhog Day, Part One</b><br><i>by anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The Guardian awoke as he did every time, to the sound of distant battle and the Call of his Master, the Light. He stretched his newly healed limbs as he methodically but quickly strapped on the tools of his trade. When the Master called, it wasn't
wise to tarry. He paused briefly, a question forming again in his consciousness, asking why. Why was he chosen? He quickly pushed that thought aside and mounted his steed. Grimacing briefly, he incanted the spell to take him to his destination. He hated using spellcraft, it sapped his strength and speed, but it was a necessary evil in the job he was sworn to do. He was a tool for the light and would do what must be done. The world faded to black around him.</p>

<p align=left>Light stung his eyes through his helm as he faded back into existence in the mortal realm. He took a moment to gain his bearings and assess the situation. All was quiet on the outskirts of the clearing but the loud sounds of battle nearby promised that the Call spoke true once again. He had long since failed to be surprised at the accuracy of his Master. Sniffing the air, he smelled the rancid odor of decay. His old nemesis, the undead of the Order of the Ebon Skull lurked about. Judging by the sounds of it, they did a little more than lurk. LOA blood was being spilled this day, and it was about time to add a little OES blood. Except, mostly, they didn't bleed. They tended to rot away at best. The Guardian had pondered more than once as to why silver weapons didn't affect these undead more than normal weapons. He shrugged and thanked the Light that poison did. A light sheen of poison of the deadly variety coated his katana as he drew it and rode towards the clearing.</p>

<p align=left>The Lost Order had its hands full that day. Corpses of man and beast littered the clearing and it looked as though it was firmly in the grasp of the undead. The fight appeared to be a lost cause but the Guardian didn't mind that. It wouldn't be the first time he had fought against overwhelming odds. Nor the last. The Light willing. Tightening his grip on his sword he picked out the first of the undead to test his sword arm against. </p>

<p align=left>So swift was his assault that Gath of Baal almost didn't see it coming. He barely had enough time to block the vicious cut with his shield as he turned his horse. Gath was renowned for his ability with a shield but the Guardian moved quicker than Gath could block. The second swing drew a sharp line of blood as it cut through the chainmail links on Gath's side. Apparently this one still had some blood in his veins. The wound began to bubble as the poison took affect and Gath wheeled his horse and galloped back into the clearing, yelling for a cure. </p>

<p align=left>Apparently some of the dark brood had forgotten that poison affected them in this realm and a couple laughed as Gath wildly rode in. He again yelled for a cure as the Guardian swiftly closed the distance between them. Gath's back was to the Guardian
now. A paladin would have paused and waited for Gath to regroup for a fair duel. The Guardian was no paladin. His sword flashed as it came down with the power only a Guardian could wield.</p>

<p align=left>Turning his horse so swiftly that Gath's body had not hit the ground yet, the Guardian slashed at the next closest member of the dark order and Pandora was unlucky enough to be that member. Wearing nothing but mages robes, the katana scored deeply,
driving the poison closer to her dark heart. She staggered away coughing in pain and pulled an orange potion from beneath her robes. Drinking quickly she straightened and began to incant a spell.Paralyzation. The Guardian ignored the implications if she 
succeeded with her spell and spurred his horse forward. He interrupted her spell gestures with a quick cut across her wrists and once
again she doubled over in pain. The Guardian sent a quick thanks to the Light that some poison still remained and cut Pandora down remorselessly as she fled. </p>

<p align=left>The other undead finally became aware of his presence now and Victen Demacles of that foul order flung himself at the Guardian. The two briefly crossed swords and both left wounds upon the other. Again they clashed with a sound of thunder and the Guardian felt his strength finally began to ebb as blood flowed freely from two terrible wounds the undead one had inflicted upon him. However, the Light had not deserted him as Victen staggered back with the last dose of poison from the Guardian's blade eating through him. Through a haze of pain, the Guardian made out the chant of a heal spell. Hope briefly flared but quickly faded when he recognized the dark hue of that one known only as Killer. Fighting the familiar pain of approaching darkness, the Guardian staunched his wounds with a quick bandage, uncapped a yellow potion and drank it's warmth. His eyes cleared and he rode into the nearby forest to reassess the situation and re-poison his weapon.</p>

<p align=left>The Guardian paused in the shadow of a giant Yew tree and unstoppered a bottle of deadly poison, smiling as the unmistakable tang of the poison cut the air. It wasn't a smile you would normally associate with one of the Light. Some would even go so far as to say the Guardians weren't really of the Light. Others would say they were no better than the evil they killed. The Guardian didn't care much about what others would say. As long as he heard the Call, he would answer to his Master. </p>

<p align=left>The Guardian quickly checked his wounds and was pleased they had healed leaving only small scars to join the many others scattered about his body. Another gift from his Master. Nodding in satisfaction he rode around the clearing to enter from a different
path than he had exited. No point in being too obvious. </p>

<p align=left>Victen turned in time to meet his charge and countered his slash with one of his own as the two combatants met again. This time,the poison seemed ineffectual as the two traded blows. Blood flowed freely from the Guardian as the undead one scored again and again.</p>

<p align=left>However, the Guardian inflicted his own damage and Victen's chain mail hung in tatters on his undead form. The two combatants broke apart and paused. The Guardian quickly applied some bandages to his gaping wounds and prayed for the Light to save his hide as it had done so many times in the past.</p>

<p align=left>Victen laughed, "Foolish mortal, the pitiful Light won't save you this time. Embrace Oblivion. It's your only hope for an easy death."
Victen ran at the Guardian with an unholy light shining from his blade raised high. Wisdom finally dawned on the Guardian as he parried the overhand slash. Victen was using a blade blessed by an unholy force. It would take more than he had to defeat this one, equipped as he was.</p>
