<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Four</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>He had asked me if I had this spell or that and I did have one but of course not the other. He left word he was on his way so I decided to swim until he came. Swim. Practice swimming he said. So I did practice. I swam back and forth over and over again under the docks of Freeport. Back and forth over and over and then he called out my name. I looked like a half drown rat from the sewers by the time I emerged from the water. He greeted me with a muffin and drink telling me I looked like I needed it, and also gave me the Sense the Undead spell. He is so thoughtful. </p>

<p align=left>He casts his protective spells on me, and one for good measure, which doubled my health points. This frightened me a bit since it got me to wondering how dangerous this place he is taking me to. Then we were off to the Ocean he said to swim our way there wherever there was. I had just finished swimming and now more? We reached the shore where he told me to start off before him since his skill at swimming was much greater than mine. Into the water I went and started swimming. I was nervous that I couldn't see him, but every once in awhile he said a few reassuring words. Past Northern Ro , then past Oasis to our destination of Southern Ro. There he told me of a safe spot to bind myself, which I did.</p>

<p align=left>While we were waiting Mundayn came to give me a backpack to give to Aanlain before he left the Land of Norrath forever. My golden one turned himself into the form of a Dark Elf to bid Mundayin farewell. It was quite a shock and I was unprepared for it. Although I knew inside there was still my golden one, I did not feel as secure. That sad business done, my next lesson began.</p>

<p align=left>Safely bound he brought me up to the top of a hill and explained to me how to hunt there. He explained how to use root. Use root to keep a creature away while ya cast on it then if it breaks free hit it. I can still his his voice, 'If you cast root, use it to stand back and cast on the creature, only melee with it if root has failed, or if you are using root to prevent it fleeing when its life is low . First smite then root move away and smite till root breaks then melee. If it was an undead creature do Expulse Undead, root move back then Expulse till root breaks then melee.' My golden one stood there and kept careful watch over me telling me when I had gone out too far when searching for prey and when I had run to far back up the hill… I began with spiders. I rooted one, which broke away from the spell, and I did my best to kill it. I think he saw my frustration and explained a little more about that root spell. Root can be used to hold creatures away while killing one, but if ya cast on one it is more likely to break away and come after ya. He then told me that my armor is good and I should be able to withstand the blows if they do break free.</p>

<p align=left>Over and over again I went out and got a spider, determined to get one as he had instructed but always getting something not quite right. I saw a mummy that was in my ability and cast smite on it then root but it broke free. I had wanted to run away but kept in mind what he had said and stood my ground. I tried to cast Expulse Undead on it but the casting time was so long, so in frustration I cast Smite. I finally did kill it. Sitting behind him for safety I asked him what to do. Expulse took so long. He told me it was a personal decision but Expulse was more mana efficient. He also told me to meditate until full before getting the next creature. </p>

<p align=left>My meditation was broken at one point when he asked me to consider a ghoul that was upon him. It was within my abilities. He cast a spell, which made it run away, and I completed my meditation. Finally I was of mana, and it returned. I cast root and then Expulse Undead upon it until it was no more. I was so proud. I did it exactly as he instructed. I think he was happy too because he gave me a muffin and drink to celebrate my success. </p>

<p align=left>He talked of taking me to Unrest. I have heard of that place and wanted to try it but it sounded to scary to venture alone. He told me that although I could try it now it would be best to wait and so I will. </p>

<p align=left>I did not bring but one backpack with me and I had no more room to carry items. He offered me a bag that he said had my Christmas present in it. He said I could use it if I promised not to look in it. Well, I knew better of myself and said no. I knew I could not wait to open it. So he offered me another empty backpack. </p>

<p align=left>The hour grew late again and my golden one looked tired. I knew it was time for him to leave. He promised to return tomorrow to continue my lessons. I am looking forward to it. I will hunt before he arrives to practice my skills more and to surprise him hopefully with some improvement.</p>

<p align=left>This desert is very different than the snow of Everfrost. I will have to find a place with some shade to sleep.</p>
