<p align=left><b>Journal of a Schlar Part V</b><br><i>by William</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I stretched my weary legs as I tried to climb out of the hard bunk in the Yew Militia Outpost. Although it could hardly be called a comfortable bed I felt rested and able for another journey. I stepped outside the Outpost still contemplating about my recent discoveries. A cute little hind greated me gently as I stroled towards the Serpents Cross Tavern. Hmmm let's see.. can I find a clear path in my discoveries. I was already sure that finding the resting grounds of that Wizard last known to posses the Tome of Making would be vital to my research. Due to help of many brave warriors of the Lost Order of Akalebeth we managed to find the main study of the Wizard deep within the damned hallways of Hythlot. The very fact that deamonlike reflections of this Wizard were left behind there to protect his quarters led me to believe that wherever this Wizard had resided he left behind these ghostly fiends to guard his dens. The journal recovered from his study was abit chaotic though. </p>

<p align=left>The journal did indeed tell us he was in the possession of the Tome of Making, yet to compleet his own research in the netherworlds he said he needed to visit 'The Warriors Graveyard'. Quite a strange name for graveyard and due to the fact I do not leave comfort of libraries to often I could not recall such a place. Perhaps his last entry would shed some light on the matter: "Damned! I was conducting my research in the Crypts where the warriors lay today when I was attacked by a foolish band of Ettins. These mindless creatures know not the importance of my work. I quickly disposed of what seemed to be a scouting force. I managed to find one of these large lugs of flesh that was barely alive after I set their ignorent heads on fire. He mumbled some native words explaining I was stealing their victems and that the Big Lord was upset. Lacking the sympathy to put him out of his misery I left him there to receive a painfull death. Tomorrow I shall go again, I need to finish this work or all is lost! It wont be easy though mindless creatures these ae, but numerous and primal power is their strength. We shall see if they will listen to reason, or if they will fall to my wrath!"</p>

<p align=left>I was still going over the Wizards journal when I entered the Serpent's Cross Tavern. Hmmm my Akalebethian friends don't seem to be here.. quite strange. I glanced on the adventurers present: Sunwolf, Hood Silverhand, Amalek, Rictar, Fizban, Will Ghostal, Windlord, Lord Rainbow King and Rabulkian. We all sat down and pondered on the whereabouts of the Graveyard when Windlord, esteemed nobleman from Eldanor proposed the underground lair of Wrong. There is a small graveyard at the entrance where the Trolls and Ettins who dwell within display their victims. Realising this must be the aformentionned graveyard we embarked for Wrong. </p>

<p align=left>The brave adventurers led the way into the Crypts at the entrance to the Ettin Realm. Seemingly everything in the Crypt cried out to us to stay away and heed their warning of death should we proceed. And indeed no sooner had we entered this foul reeking cavern or a group of Lizardmen where upon us. Realising this was only a warmup for what layed ahead we quickly disposed of them and pressed on deeper inside. Carefully we proceeded through hallway after hallway when we entered a large room. Nothing could have prepared us for that sight. There was an Ogre Lord in the back surrounded by an astonishing large group of Ettins and even a small band of human mercenaries. The warriors instinctively took up a protective position around myself and awaited the inevitable. They formed a small circle with myself in the inside and braced themselves as wave after wave of Ettin flung onto their ranks. The sight was horrific, as blood gushed everywhere. An Ettins strength is legendary and they proved worthy of that reputation. Barely the brave adventures could ward off the first wave of monsters as a second wave approached, supported by a group of vile mercenaries. Many a warrior nearly sank to the floor under soo much violence but the Virtues where on our side. The force of the attack seemed to fade away as the Ogre Lord himself stormed forward. His mighty arms gripped Rictar firmly and flung him unconcious against the wall. The large beast seemed to have some interest in me and raised his mighty fist to slay me when Windlord threw himself before the strike. Windlord lay motionless on the floor but the battle was fauhgt. The other quickly disposed of the beast with a combined effort of steal and magics.</p>

<p align=left>After Rictar and Windlord were back on their feet I kneeled down next to the dead Ogre Lord. I searched his sluggish body and found a scrap of paper with some strange markings on it. The message was unclear since I couldn't decipher it but I could recognize the picture of one of the Wizards deamons on it. I told the tired warriors this piece of paper would surely tell us where the Wizard can be found. Some warriors wanted to press on, but then again others desperatly needed to tend their wounds. So I proposed we took some rest first, wich would enable me to study this document abit further. I told my friends to keep an eye on the Serpent's Cross Tavern. There's a small board out front where messages can be left, I told them I would leave a message there when we would continue onto the final lap of our long journey. After a small word of thanks the warriors departed and I returned back to Yew Militia Outpost for a secure restingplace. I almost grew to like the ol' bunk in there...</p>
