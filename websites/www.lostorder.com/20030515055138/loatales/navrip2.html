<p align=left><b>The Return</b><br><i>by Navrip</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The winds blew across the desiccated plain, making the dry grass shudder and whistle, like the raspy breath of one nearing death. In unison, the young couple shuddered at it. Mikael looked over at his bride to be and smiled, trying to reassure her. He knew where there were going, at least, he thought he did.</p>

<p align=left>"We've got to be getting close to Vesper!" he said to her, wrapping an arm protectively around her shoulder. "It's only a few days travel from Yew and we've been traveling for three days now. I doubt we'll be much longer in this wilderness."</p>

<p align=left>Riana smiled back at him, taking minor comfort in his words. She was still nervous, though she didn't let Mik see. She didn't remember this endless plain from when she was a child living in Vesper. She certainly didn't remember there being such dryness, especially near the ocean city. </p>

<p align=left>A dry rustling caught their attention. Mikael whirled around and pulled out his hunting knife, holding it in front of him like a sword. The grass parted and a sickly looking rabbit stuck its head out of the grass. It made a plaintiful bleating sound as it looked at them. Its skin hung heavy against its bones. The thing looked to have not eaten in days. Certainly, this dry grass was not suitable for it. Mikael looked at it pitifully. "Best to put it out of its misery," he said.</p>

<p align=left>He bent down to grab it. It didn't even put up a struggle or try to bolt. The thing was so weak, it could barely move. "No!" Riana said. Mikael turned around to look at her. Pity and mercy showed in her eyes. Mikael sighed. He was an animal handler and he knew that this poor creature was beyond saving. The stench of death already hung about it. But Riana would never let him kill it.</p>

<p align=left>“If we don’t, it’ll just suffer longer. Nothing we do can save it now Riana. Let me save it the pain.” He turned his back to her, hoping to gain some measure of strength to kill the rabbit. He felt the sorrow hitting his back like a physical force. He brought his knife up to its throat, prompting a whimper from Riana. Mikael sighed. He dropped the knife and pulled a carrot out of his pack. He placed it and the rabbit on the ground. The animal gobbled up the measly offering and skittered off, with renewed energy. </p>

<p align=left>Riana’s face was so full of joy, that Mikael could ignore the fact that he probably just gave that poor creature another few days to live before it starved to death. She wrapped her arms around him and gave him a light kiss on the cheek. He shook his head and chuckled slightly.</p>

<p align=left>“Come on, let’s go,” he said. </p>

<p align=left>She smiled and the two of them continued on without further incident until nightfall. Then they set up their camp and looked out into the darkness. “Mikael,” Riana said, “I don’t see Vesper yet. Should we not be nearing it?”</p>

<p align=left>Mikael frowned. They should indeed be nearing it, but he didn’t want to worry her. She new nothing of distances traveled by walking. She had stayed most of her life inside and did all of her traveling by horseback. But because Mikael had no horse to accompany her, she had agreed to go on foot. </p>

<p align=left>“Don’t worry love,” he said in the most reassuring voice he could muster, “we are still a day or so away from it. It won’t be much longer. We should be thankful we haven’t run into any monsters yet.” </p>

<p align=left>As if on some eerie cue, a rustle in the grass was heard. Mikael pulled out his hunting knife and Riana jumped. Out of the grass came another famished rabbit. It looked up at Mikael plaintively. He frowned and bent down to study it. “By the virtues…” he muttered. “If this isn’t the same rabbit from earlier, let a mage come here and grant me three wishes as we speak!”</p>

<p align=left>“Do you think it followed us?” Riana asked. </p>

<p align=left>Mikael frowned again. “I suppose it could have. But why? And how? This thing was hardly able to move until I fed it. I doubt it could have followed us all this way on its own.”</p>

<p align=left>“What do you mean?” Riana asked.</p>

<p align=left>Mikael was silent. He just noticed something about the rabbit. Its ribs were sticking out of its skin. By all rights, it shouldn’t be able to move; yet there it was, alive and well. Or was it… “By all that is good and pure, this rabbit is undead!” Mikael yelped, leaping backwards away from it.</p>

<p align=left>Riana’s eyes went wide. Her mouth opened to say something, but the words turned to screams. The entire ground was rustling in front of them. Wave after wave of rabbits, in various states of death and decay, came pouring out of the grass into the campsite. </p>

<p align=left>Mikael took his knife and began slashing at them. It took several blows to keep them down, for even severing their heads from their bodies was not enough to keep these undead horrors from continuing on. They scratched at him with sharp claws and bit at him with disease-ridden teeth. Riana screamed horribly as he went down under the mass of ravenous undead rabbits.</p>

<p align=left>They swarmed over his body like plague rats. Riana sat paralyzed in fear at he plaintifully screamed and begged for her to run. She couldn’t though, she was too afraid to move. His screams quieted down and the rabbits poured off of him. The creatures slowly dispersed back into the grass. Riana crept forward, fear flooding her body. </p>

<p align=left>She screamed louder than she ever had before at the sight before her. Mikael’s body lay there, stripped of all flesh and material. All that was left was his skeleton, gripping a hunting knife in the left hand. She stood and started to run. She ran faster than she’d ever ran before, but every time she looked back, his skeleton was still there, laying a few feet behind her.</p>

<p align=left>Finally, exhausted, she collapsed to the ground. Her body was covered in a sweaty lather. She turned her head and saw no skeleton behind her. She began to sob, wondering aloud where those creatures had come from. </p>

<p align=left>The wind suddenly picked up, caressing her body and throwing her hair around. She looked up and saw what seemed to be a moongate of pure black opening in front of her. Out stepped a figure, dressed in the same ebon colorings of the moongate. It’s eyes burned with a fiery red. It looked down at her and its midnight lips parted. “The forces of Oblivion,” it told her, as if answering a question.</p>

<p align=left>It turned and stalked off; leaving her there as a horridly familiar rustling sound came ever closer to her.</p>
