: I've semi-reread the post discussion below.. and it did get borderline..overly personal.

: 
: I know it's awfully difficult to not let it get to that as we are all passionate people and the feelings we are expressing are so personal to ourselves that it's hard to not make personal injectures about others.

: I highly encourage discussion and disagreement!

: I highly discourage personal attacks.

: for example:
: if you don't agree simply stating: I don't agree, this is how I feel..
: is much more acceptable and mature then saying: Yer so stoopid ..you obviously must be a newbie-nobody cuz you don't know anything.

: We all have our own oppinions and thoughts and styles and we simply WON'T agree on everything.

: And this is GOOD!.. 

: So anyways.. I don't want Minuette upset and gone NOR do I want Darius upset and gone.. and hopefully after they both take some time to cool down and get past the feelings they were having at those moments they will join us again.

: This group has really come together and seems to be growing in a poitive way every day.

: I'm very proud of this group.. and considering the very few ammount of skirmishes that have occurred here.. I'm VERY VERY proud of all the people who come to post and lurk here.

: Read some other boards for a few days and you won't see this kind of 'working' togetherness.
