<p align=left>Captain's Log: Snowreap 13, 10 P.Y.</p>

<p align=left>I've spent a good number of days here on the outskirts of town with me young filly. T'was many a joyous day and night here in this place. Quite peaceful I should say, the land lubbin' farmers life that is. Quite a good peice of 'unting in the area as well. Me hands are starting to relearn the art of usin' a bow. Tis slow learning, and I fear it will be some time before I can match me skills before I fell out of Sosaria and into this place. Still I have no regrets if most of the people are as friendly as Jessica's be to me.</p>

<p align=left>Still today I found one more angry creature of Dereth that I can out run but not out fight, that would an Angry Husband. Seems Jesse was 'olding out some infermation from me fer the past week or so. Still t'wasn't the man size, nor his stream of profanity that almost made ME cring, but t'was that bloody (well would-be bloody) ax of his. He seemed quite intent on splitin' me head in two fer acepting such hospitality from his wife while he was a travelin'. I suppose I can see his point in all. In any event I managed to haul most of me sorry carcase out the door and I made a run fer it. I'd 'ave made it too, if'in it wasn't fer those damned wasps.</p>

<p align=left>I knew there was somethin' funny about this place and all. Now I've put me finger, well the chared remnant there of on the problem. Colorin' in this place is a might decieving. You'd thing the RED wasps' would be the ones to bar-be-q ye like a Anchent Wyrm or somethin, and the BLUE wasps' would give ye the cold shoulder so to speak (that is if ye expect wasps to have the magical power of the tooth farie, but then again wasps aren't usually 6 feet long either) Still I ran from that crazy bugger with the ax, and fell right into a hornets nest, well a wasps nest at least. On second I'm eye to eye with a half dozen six footer's and the next I'm sitin' by the Cragstone Life stone, trying to get the brimstone and soot out of me smoulderin' cloths.</p>

<p align=left>Well I picked meself up and brushed meself off, then headed fer the local pub to try and get the buzzin' out of me ears and back in me head where it belonged. I walked in and ordered the usual, a nice stout with mug of mead to wash it down with. The local wench who I'm sure'd been missin' me since I left town came inquirin'. She went into a peice about how I didnt' pay me tab from the last time I was in town. Bloody extortionist! Bah! Still she 'ad a good peice of news fer me, seems there was an archer callin' himself Tasslehof Windrunner, lookin' fer me in town. I'd be willin' to bet that good ol' Tass of the recon force come to find me. I didn't think I'd been that conspiqous but then again... The fair lady at the bar told me (and only after I payed me tab, Extortionist!) that he'd headed back towards Rithwic when he didn't find me. Tonight I think I'll find some way to "pay up" and then tomorrow it's off to Rithwic again.</p>

<p align=left>Whew, I need to be gettin' on the road today. Me head's throbbin' and makin' up me tab here's nearly killed me. Blimy,.. Still Rithwic's a good day's journey away, 'opefully I'll be able to make it by night fall. I don't relish a night out in the open with all the beaties like them damned wasps, or those 'ungry little reedshark pup. Oy! Here's hopin' and running' like Heck!</p>

<p align=left>Blimy, I'm exhausted. I've been runnin' since early this mornin'. First from the bar wench of Cragstone (where on Dereth did she get the friggin' cat o' nine tales anyway??) then from the crazed farmer, (you'd then he'd 'ave forgotten me by now) an then from just about every form of beatie I've ever seen 'ere on Dereth. Still I'm in Rithwic, seems almost too good to be true. From here I can almost smell the salt air of the sea cost to the east. </p>

<p align=left>So far, I've not found me brothers of the order, but if I'm right it's only a matter of time before they make their way back to this town and I can meet up with the buggers. In the mean time I'm goin' to try me best to rest a bit and keep me sorry carcase out of trouble.,.. well maybe at least rest a bit.</p>
