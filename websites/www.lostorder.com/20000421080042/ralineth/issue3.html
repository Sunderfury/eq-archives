<br><b><font color="#000000">WALARYN BASTARDS</font></b>
<br>It has come to the attention of King Ak'anon that numerous novice gnomes
have been frequenting the grand mechanical city of Ak'anon claiming to
be of blood relation to the famous/infamous Walaryn Clan.&nbsp; It is believed
that this new generation of gnomes with names such as Wyloon, Wyleddyn
and Wynwood are actually the bastard sons of Wyntrok the Dashing, a rogue
of some repute who disappeared near the northern city of Halas many seasons
ago.&nbsp; Nevertheless, these new Walaryns, combined with the sons of
Wynston the Brave and Wyndsor the Pious now turn up under every rock or
shrub in Steamfont, much to the dismay of the local indigenous populations
of Kobolds, Harpies and Minotaur Slavers.&nbsp; Furthermore, it is rumoured
that the Walaryns may have "underworld" connections, but this reporter
could neither confirm nor deny such allegations.&nbsp; Woozle Walaryn,
the alleged patriarch of the family, responded to such allegations by stating
that "the members of the Walaryn Clan endeavour to advance the causes of
the family, by all means at their disposal."&nbsp; This cryptic response
can only lead one to question the motivations of this mysterious family,
and wonder how they will influence future Ak'anonian affairs.

<br><b>OGRE COMMITS ATROCITY IN SUREFALL GLADES</b>
<br>There is mourning in Surefall Glades as the community lays to rest
one of the most controversial of it's inhabitants. Mammoth, a grizzled
old bear recently accused of killing a Surefall resident, was slaughtered
overnight by an Ogre. Authorities are unsure if this was revenge for Mammoths
prior actions of just the whim of a blood-crazed Shadow Knight. Reports
also implicated a female Barbarian and a local Ranger in the execution.

CATASTROPHE</b>
<br>What was planned to be a simple exercise in Cyclops hunting recently
turned to disaster after a group comprising noted paladin Zirc, his betrothed,
the cleric Osyra, long-nosed patriarch of the Walaryn Clan, Woozle, and
a unnamed wolf decided that Cyclops hunting lacked a challenge and set
off to the legendary temple of Cazic-Thule. After finding a secure position
near the entrance to the temple the group initially had some success in
slaying the evil reptiles, until a large group of the creatures rallied
and charged the hapless adventurers en-mass. Osyra and Zirc quickly fell
to the onslaught of lizard beasties, and only quick thinking by the Gnome
and an excellent ability to follow short creatures by the wolf saved the
remaining two party members.

<br><b>YET ANOTHER PALADIN INVOLVED IN SENSELESS MASSACRE</b>
<br>Hot on the heels of our previous expos&eacute; on misdoings by Paladins,
comes reports from an unnamed source (rumoured to be in league with the
extremist animal protection society the unkempt preservers) of another
paladin in-training engaging in some rather dubious activity. It appears
that Valdox slaughtered a trio of those cuddly creatures of the forest,
kodiak bears, after they had been baited by a mob of Aradani poachers.
Sources close to the upper echelons of the Surefall Glade and Kelethin
Councils indicate that they are extremely unhappy with the blind-eye that
is being turned to these incidents by the Royal Palace in Felwithe. What
comes of this can only be speculated, but needless to say that relations
between these groups are somewhat strained at present.

<br><b>FURTOG OGREBANE REJOICES - MUDTOE OGRES ELIMINATED</b>
<br>Reports today from Kaladim say that son of the famed Burtog Ogrebane
handed the heads of the last two Mudtoe Ogres to the King today. Further
investigation indicates that Furtog did not kill the remaining Mudtoes,
Boog and Goob, but that a bounty hunter tracked them to their hide-out
in the Ocean of Tears and returned the heads to Furtog for a reward. Furtog
has been tight-lipped over these accusations, insisting that he tracked
them himself.

'little-uns' until they feel better about it. Reports of a mystery wolf
being seen in the area before the murder are currently unsubstantiated,
but druids from the local druid circle were not entirely unhappy with the
outcome.</font>

<br><b>HISTORY OF THE ELVEN RACE (part 1)</b>
<br>As part of our ongoing task of educating the unwashed, we present to
you a brief history of the Elven race.
<br>We all know that Tunare placed the Elves upon the surface of&nbsp;
Norrath in the beginning of the Elder Age, and that soon after this Innoruuk,
the Prince of Hate kidnapped the first Elvish King and Queen and bent and
twisted them to his will to create the Teir'Dal. But how did the Elves
become two races? We know from our history that Tunare only created one
race, yet we also know that by the end of the Age of Blood the elves had
split into two groupings, the woodland loving Wood Elves and the High Elves
who lived in cities built of stone and magic. Is it possible that somewhere
between these Ages the elves became two separate races or is there another
explanation? Recent research into this question leads to the interesting
proposition that the elves are still one race, although this is contested
by both Wood and High Elves alike. However a number of disturbing facts
remain. The offspring from a union of either Wood or High Elves and Humans
is a Half-Elf and it is impossible to tell the race of it's Elven parents.
Also the offspring from a union between Wood and High Elves takes on the
characteristics of the region they were brought up in. These facts have
lead keen-minded researches to propose that there is still only one Elven
race and that the differences between are related to the environment they
were brought up in. Whether this is true not, it is sure to spark controversy
over which of the two groupings have remained true to their heritage.
