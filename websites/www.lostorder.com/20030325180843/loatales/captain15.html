<p align=left>Captain's Log: Seedsow 11</p>

<p align=left>Well I enjoyed a very nice vacation in Lytelthorpe for the last few days. Still I felt it was time to move on again, mostly because I’ve run out of gold again, and I need to do something to be able to afford me next ale. Seems Selfora’s gotten a wee bit smarter, and she won’t give me an ale unless I pay her first. Now I don’t understand this, as I’ve always paid me tab one way or another, but I guess I’ll have to live with it.</p>

<p align=left>Not quite sure where I wanted to go, I started walking along the eastern road out of Lytelthorpe. I stumbled across a portal that would take me to Rithwic again. Figurin’ I had nothing to loose, I walked though the portal and back to Rithwic. Still something in me wanderlust was not satisfied, I still felt like there were other places I should explore in search of gold, ale, and the occasional bar wench.</p>

<p align=left>Somehow I managed to get through the Rithwic portal without having to fight me stomach to retain me breakfast. Feeling emboldened by this newfound tolerance of mine, I decided to immediately brave the portal to Holtburg. This I fear was a mistake. This time I left the contents of me stomach in portal space. Where it landed I don’t wish to guess, but I’m sure someone will be most unhappy.</p>

<p align=left>Still it took me a little while to clear me head enough to stand again. Its been a while since I visited Holtburg. I guess this town will always have a place in me heart since it was the first thing I saw when I arrived here in Dereth. Still I couldn’t bring myself to stay here very long. I choose instead to head out for Glenden Wood, since after all they have some of the best Aluvian stout I have ever found.</p>

<p align=left>Well I stopped at the Taut String to pick up some arrows, and set off along the road to Glenden Wood. The more I travel the roads of Dereth, the more I wonder why some Lord or Lady does not raise an army and make some effort at making the roads safe for merchants and vagabonds alike. The road to Glenden Wood was only slight less dangerous than the one between Glenden Wood and Cragstone. I know that humans could never extinguish all threats on the roads of Dereth, but blimy, we hardly try!</p>

<p align=left>Still somehow, after going through a full quiver of arrows, and most of me nerves I managed to fight and run my way to Glenden Wood. Still though, I was handsomely rewarded for my efforts when I got to the Helm and Shield in Glenden Wood. Tis very odd that I feel so at home somewhere so far away from the seas. Though I must say I have never traveled to Eastham or Dryreach, both the only Aluvian towns on the coast, so I can’t say that this place is the only calling me as home. Still the tall trees and surrounding hills remind me so very much of me old home in Yew.</p>

<p align=left>Mayhaps tomorrow I shall further explore the area around Glenden Wood. Perhaps I shall even make the trip to Cragstone for a time to see if I can catch up with my fellow guardians of the Shard and Tome.</p>

<p align=left>Captain's Log: Seedsow 12</p>

<p align=left>The first thing I did this morning was to forgo my exploration of Glenden Wood for the open road to Cragstone. Mayhaps another time I will explore the woods around Glenden Wood, but from how Wilomine at the Helm and Shield described the area around Glenden Wood, I think I would do better to hunt somewhere else until I have more confidence in my archery skills, and less need of me running talents.</p>

<p align=left>With that in mind I filled my quiver and filled a water skin with the rich dark stout they brew at the Helm and Shield, and I set off for Cragstone once again. Seems to me that I wind up running laps of Aluvian territory quite often, but I don’t mind that so much. This is beautiful country if I’ve ever seen such. It’s almost enough to make me consider the land lubbin’ ranger’s life. Still my hunger for the open sea, the salty air, and all that comes with the life of a sailor will never leave my heart. I was born to a life on the sea, and when my soul leaves my body for good, it will be on the open seas that it happens.</p>

<p align=left>The trip to Cragstone was every bit as dangerous as I remember it. There were banderlings and shreth everywhere along the roadside. Still it was nothing I couldn’t fight, or out run, so I wasn’t too worried. Along the way I met a fellow traveler, by the name of Rice Cake. I happened upon him as he was fighting a pack of young banderlings. With his sword and their front, and my bow at their back we made short work of the lot of them. Since we were both traveling to Cragstone, we choose to travel together, since such is always safer than traveling alone.</p>

<p align=left>Our journey together was long and treacherous, but with the two of us fighting together, we managed to make it together to Cragstone. This wasn’t without setback, but I’ve never been one to like wasps of any color, especially the blue ones.</p>

<p align=left>Once in Cragstone, we wet with Barron Tasslehoff Windrunner. Seem s Tasslehoff was in the area scouting fer a new home for the Order on Dereth. Tasslehoff was interested in scouting out the old Fort Witshire, just to the west of Cragstone. I offered my assistance and together we again departed. Rice Cake had to leave out fellowship as he had urgent business elsewhere in the realm but Tasslehoff and I headed out to find the fort.</p>

<p align=left>Tasslehoff had been there before, a while before I had come to Dereth. His review of the place was glowing to say the least. Still I was skeptical, I wanted to see the place with me own eyes first. I need not have waited. We fought out way to within sight of the fort, just as the sun started to set over her ramparts. This place is truly a place a beauty! I can almost hear the thick walls of the fort callin’ me home, much as our village did before.</p>

<p align=left>The down side of the fort I found out soon after. Seems that armadillos and rats have overrun the fort proper, and drudges the dungeons below. Still I figure with a little repair work to the main gates, and the combined efforts of the Order in combat, and we could clear out both the dungeon and the fort, to make our new home safe.</p>

<p align=left>Once we clear the fort and take it as our own, we could then begin to safeguard the road between Glenden Wood, and Cragstone. We could also start to spread the light of the Shard and wisdom of the Tome throughout the realm from here. Still it would take work to pull something like that off, but we could do it.</p>

<p align=left>After Tasslehoff gave me a quick tour of the place, (between slaying rats and armadillos) we headed back for Cragstone. All in all it has been an exciting day filled with danger, excitement, and joy. For now I’ll sit back here at Thorsten’s Rest and enjoy a few ales, and a few tales.</p></blockquote>
