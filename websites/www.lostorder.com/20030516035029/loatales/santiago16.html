<p align=left><b>From Dracherio's Journal: Toxxulia</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Today I walked along the edge of the riverbank. Why? I suppose I was curious to see where it would lead me. I had become tired of wandering the woods near the city, scavenging for snake skins and spider legs. I was convinced that there was more to the forest, if only I had the courage to venture deeper into its dark heart.</p>

<p align=left>As I walked, my eyes glanced from time to time out across those murky waters, but the ever-present gloom prevented me from seeing very far. It seems to me sometimes that Toxxulia is alive, that it possesses a consciousness. And sometimes I think that Toxxulia hides itself on purpose, cloaking itself in perpetual shadows and fog to confuse and dishearten those whom it views as trespassers.</p>

<p align=left>I walked, and I walked, and then I walked some more. So far was I from the city gates that I began to question the wisdom of venturing further. Toxxulia had been quiet thus far, but perhaps it was only biding its time. I could almost feel its eyes upon me, curious and suspicious. “What are you doing here?” it asked voicelessly. “You should turn back,” breathed the dark trees in wordless admonishment. But I kept walking. There comes a point when you’ve simply gone too far to turn back.</p>

<p align=left>A few minutes later, I saw a shape in the fog. It seemed to materialize before me as I approached it, as if it had not been there before, as if the forest itself had summoned it for me. A bridge, leading into the darkness.</p>

<p align=left>As I drew closer, more of the bridge came into view. At first I assumed that it was made of wood or metal that had been painted white. But I realized my mistake when I touched the beginning of the framework. In spite of myself, I shuddered and took a step back. It was made of bone – a giant skeletal walkway across a dark, foreboding river. </p>

<p align=left>Never had I heard of anything like this before. But whatever fear I felt was completely overshadowed by voracious curiosity. I wanted to know what was on the other side.</p>

<p align=left>My first step did not bring the bridge to life and swallow me whole, as I half-suspected it would. Nor did the second, nor the third. I have said before that I am not immune to a fear of the unknown, a fear that we all share. But when that fear becomes commingled with a real and tangible danger, when we realize that there actually is something out there, lurking in those shadows – that is where true horror begins. Such was my state of mind upon seeing the bodies at the end of that bridge.</p>

<p align=left>There were four of them, strewn haphazardly on the ground as if they had fallen out of some carnivorous giant’s pack as he passed through the area. I could not tell how long they had been dead, nor could I discern the cause of that death. But something had killed them. They had not perished from starvation, disease or poison. Something had killed them, swiftly and brutally. That ‘something’ might still be nearby.</p>

<p align=left>My eyes flitted and darted about, but I saw not a soul. Not one spider, snake or kobold. Only the trees, standing dark and silent. And in my heightened apprehensiveness, I wondered if the forest itself had not killed these people. The forest, alive.</p>

<p align=left>I took a step backward. My curiosity bled away at last in the face of real danger. Had these people been lured here by curiosity, as I had? Or had the forest called us here with its silent, irresistible voice, to be devoured?</p>

<p align=left>I retreated back across the bridge, and began the long journey back to Erudin, back to comfortable familiarity. As I walked, my fear subsided. But I vowed to myself that I would one day return to that skeletal bridge, and cross it, and learn the secrets that Toxxulia guarded so jealously.</p>
