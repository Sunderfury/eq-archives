<blockquote>
<p align=left>The walk back to the temple was a relief after the chilling encounter in the woods. The lights and goodness of the temple provided a warmness to Metry’s soul and got Lindsy to stop shaking nervously at the thought of what had transpired. Metry dropped Lindsy off at her room after determining that she was all right, then headed for his guard post. </p>

<p align=left>The scowling face of Agurhar met him as he opened the door. “Yer late,” he barked.</p>

<p align=left>Metry saluted to Agurhar. “Sorry, sir, there was a mishap at my home. Some local children thought it would be funny to vandalize it, then Lindsy was attacked by a bunyip.”</p>

<p align=left>Agurhar frowned. “A bunyip? What’s one o’ them doing in the city? They usually bolt at the first sign o’ humans.”</p>

<p align=left>Metry shrugged as he took his spot at the table. “I don’t know. Coulda been lost or whatever. Maybe some merchant at the festival had it as an exotic pet. It doesn’t matter now, it’s dead.” He pulled out a slim dagger and began to shine it up.</p>

<p align=left>“That’s weird. I’ll send out an alert first thing in the morning about it. Can’t have people getting frightened over these things fer nothing.” Agurhar settled back into his chair, preparing to pass the long night in thought. “So, how was the fair?”</p>

<p align=left>“Eh? Well, it was nice. Me and Lindsy got acquainted real well. Pretty much flawless up until we went to this old coot of a soothsayer. He nearly scared the daylights out of Lindsy,” Metry said. He stuck his dagger back into its sheath and pulled out his sword and went to work on that.</p>

<p align=left>“Soothsayer, huh?” Agurhar grunted.</p>

<p align=left>“Yeah, some old man in a skullcap. You know, the typical guy.”</p>

<p align=left>Agurhar sat up bolt straight. “Metry, what was the soothsayer’s name?”</p>

<p align=left>“It ain’t important,” Metry said, not catching the grave tone in Agurhar’s voice.</p>

<p align=left>“Lad, tell me what the name was,” Agurhar said in an even sterner tone.</p>

<p align=left>Metry looked up quizically. “I don’t remember. Gregory or something like that.”</p>

<p align=left>Agurhar gulped. “Was it Grigori? Please lad, tell me it wasn’t Grigori.”</p>

<p align=left>Metry frowned. “Yeah, that was it. Why?”</p>

<p align=left>Agurhar looked out the window of the guard tower and noted the moon had risen to it’s peak. He unhefted his battle axe. “Run boy,” Agurhar said in a harsh tone.</p>

<p align=left>Metry sat up and held his sword out. “What? What’s the matter?” Agurhar strided to the door and flung it open. He turned back to Metry. </p>

<p align=left>“I told you to run boy. Run to your priestess…” Agurhar barked in a harsher tone. The timbre in Agurhar’s voice sent shivers down Metry’s spine. He turned and bolted out the door, heading for Lindsy’s quarters.</p>

<p align=left>Agurhar stepped out into the night with his axe gleaming. “I won’t let you take the boy!” Agurhar yelled. “Not now, not ever!” A pale, translucent shape rose from the ground to his side. He saw it a moment too late as it plunged into his very esscence. With a final, futile yell of defiance, he plunged to the ground.</p>
