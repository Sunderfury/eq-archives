<p align=left><b>Wyndelle's Misadventures I</b><br><i>by Wyndelle</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>"Wyndelle......Wyndelle!.....WYNDELLE!!" said the voice.</p>

<p align=left>"Wha? Hmm Who?... just 5 more minutes Wysll" said the sleepy gnome.</p>

<p align=left>"Get yer arse up, it's time" said the voice. "I said 5 more minutes Wysll, now go away!" replied the stil not quite awake gnome.</p>

<p align=left>"I said get yer lazy bones up before I throw ya overboard" said the voice in a grave tone.</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle exploded out of his camp blanket as the events of the days previous came back to him in a rush. He looked around trying to blink the sleep out of his eyes and clear the cobwebs from his sleep fogged mind. There was nobody in the small storage room he and his brothers had used as a cabin for the voyage to Freeport, so he trudged up the stairs to the main deck of the boat. He searched the faces of the other passengers anxiously, looking for anyone he recognized.</p>

<p align=left>"Wyndelle" said a voice. "What?!" said Wyndelle. Several of the other passengers glanced at the young gnome, then turned away... not at all surprised that a gnome mage would be talking to himself. Thinking someone was playing tricks on him, Wyndelle headed belowdecks to the room again to finish the voyage to freeport in solitude. As he entered the room he heard the voice again.... "Wyndelle, hear me.... You are not yet ready to accompany your brothers.." said the voice.</p>

<p align=left>"Ok Wyxle... real funny, now stop it!" said Wyndelle. "Enough! listen very closely you impudent little wretch! I am trying to help you, now sit down and perk those pointy ears up, and shut yer mouth long enough for me to explain." cried the voice.</p>

<p align=left>Stunned by the outburst, Wyndelle did as requested and sat on his camp blanket.</p>

<p align=left>"You are not yet ready to accompany your bretheren Wyndelle. Were you to complete your journey, you would not only endager yourself, but your brothers as well." explained the voice.</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle frowned and took a breath to respond to the statement when the voice began again. "I told you to listen, so do so!" said the voice. Wyndelle's eyes widened as a grizled gnome stepped through hull planks of the ship and stared at him. "Your misguided brothers would try to save your worthless hide should you encounter trouble, rather than their own, thus I am here." explained the gnome.</p>

<p align=left>"First who are you? Second, how do you know me? And third can you teach me that walking through stuff trick?!? that was quite interesting to watch." said Wyndelle.</p>

<p align=left>"All in good time little one, first things first. You need to grow a bit to join your brothers, but you have no time to do so. I intend to give you that time." said the strange gnome.</p>

<p align=left>"How d.." began Wyndelle "Listen, when I am done you may ask questions, but not before." The old gnome waved his hands in the air and mumbled a few words in a language that Wyndelle could not understand. Colored lights began to play about the room and Wyndelle watched enraptured as colored balls of liquid light gathered around them both. Wyndelle began to scream as the room started to shrink. A passenger above started to head down the steps but stopped as the scream was suddenly choked off. He counted himself lucky and walked back up the stairs whistling a seaman's song.</p>
