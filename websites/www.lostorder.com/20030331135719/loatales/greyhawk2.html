<p align=left><b>A Harsh Wind Cometh</b><br><i>by Greyhawk</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>As the sea rested in silence, an icy chill swept across the dunes, causing the palm trees to sway to and fro. The birds had left long ago, for they knew a storm unlike any other was approaching. The Hebian coast had become devoid of life, desperate for the sunlight which could barely squeeze through the thick clouds above. Two figures stood atop a dune overlooking the horizon, unwavered by the frosty wind.</p>

<p align=left>With a stern look on his face, Joxer the Mighty stared endlessly into the cold. Shivering beside him stood Orion Red, no doubt longing to be somewhere else, somewhere warm. Still, he spoke not of his discomfort, and dared not complain to his devout Patron.</p>

<p align=left>"Brings a painful chill to yer spine, eh?", asked Joxer.</p>

<p align=left>"That it does m'lord", answered Orion. "But we've been through worse, and I reckon thar's more than jest a chilly breeze headin' our way."</p>

<p align=left>Joxer slowly scanned the horizon, as if searching for signs of life, anything to bring a sense of hope. "The rumors be true, Orion. The storm may have devastating effects on the land, and our people might be in peril. Though we cannot defeat it, we must prepare for it."</p>

<p align=left>"O'course, but how does one prepare fer a battle against the unknown?" questioned Orion with a puzzled look.</p>

<p align=left>For the first time that day, Joxer managed to smile. "I know yer not familiar with scholarly ways my friend, but perhaps this will be a good opportunity for ye. We must gather as much knowledge as there is to be found."</p>

<p align=left>"M'lord, ye know that I have a bloody hard time readin' them books and such. I ain't one to be searchin' libraries," replied Orion defiantly.</p>

<p align=left>"I have a different assignment for ye," answered Joxer with a sharp tone. "Tonight there will be a meeting in the town of Shoushi. Ye shall promptly attend the meeting, and gather all information regarding the upcoming storm. The meeting will be hosted by the members of Jojii's Sword, and I'm counting on ye to represent us well."</p>

<p align=left>"As ye wish m'lord," answered Orion solemnly.</p>

<p align=left>.....</p>

<p align=left>The Three Swords Hall had never been this packed before. People from all across Dereth had gathered here this eve, some eager to share ideas, while others impatiently waiting for someone to calm their fears. Fortunately, all were respectful of the gathering, and differences were temporarily set aside. After everyone was seated, a young Sho warrior stood as the crowd became silent.</p>

<p align=left>"I am Basho Genji, of the Sword of Jojii," stated the warrior. "I have called this meeting so that we might be prepared for the coming winter. I know little, but will share what I know with you. Hopefully, we might bring our knowledge together."</p>

<p align=left>Brief introductions were made as whispers were heard among the crowd. So much of the storm was unknown, causing many rumors to spread throughout the land. Orion Red carefully eyed each person in the hall, sizing up the warriors in case more than words were to be exchanged.</p>

<p align=left>"I have heard that the Frost King is a myth. Can any confirm this?" questioned Basho to the crowd.</p>

<p align=left>"I have seen no evidence to prove his existance," answered Allen Grey.</p>

<p align=left>"He does not exist, nor will he exist," stated Pew the Mottled in a confident tone.</p>

<p align=left>The crowd concurred as the whispers continued to grow.</p>

<p align=left>"A great power exists. Evil. It has been fortold by the gods..." warned Brishma.</p>

<p align=left>"Perhaps Bhal'zamon is the cause of this freeze," stated Xanadore with a worried look on his face.</p>

<p align=left>Allen Grey quickly raised his voice to gain attention from the boisterous crowd. "Please do not speak the demon's name, less ye seek to summon him."</p>

<p align=left>"I have heard that mages tampering with the elements on a large scale can change weather patterns throughout the realm merely by chance," shared Xanadore.</p>

<p align=left>"One would think..." answered Brishma as if he were accusing someone.</p>

<p align=left>Orion Red kept his thoughts to himself, yet couldn't help but mutter something about the crazed magi he had encountered in his travels. The meeting continued, rumors were struck down, and further blame of unknown magic intensifed.</p>

<p align=left>"It seems that we lack hard fact," interrupted Basho. "Perhaps a central location might be identified in which we can all share what we know as we learn it. I would be happy to volunteer the services of Jojii's Sword here in Shoushi."</p>

<p align=left>"We could hire message runners and delegate three to watch the south, desert, and the north and run information between," offered Valen Sturmsun.</p>

<p align=left>The crowd agreed that Jojii's Sword was best suited as a central gathering place of thoughts and information, and volunteers offered to share knowledge from distant lands in the weeks ahead. Basho Genji thanked everyone for their presence, and announced that another meeting would be held in one week.</p>

<p align=left>Orion felt nothing more than uncomfortable in the crowd. He knew nothing of the magicks they spoke of, nor did he care to learn them. Perhaps he was more disappointed in the lack of ale at the meeting more than anything else. Suddenly, his spirits were lifted as he noticed a familar face smiling across the crowded room...</p>
