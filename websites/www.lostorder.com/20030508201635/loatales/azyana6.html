<blockquote>
<p align=left>I began as always casting Center and Holy Armor upon myself and went off. Good thin my golden one was not around. I chose a creature just beyond my reach in my ability and survived with a breath of life and no mana to heal. The spot where he told me is safe seemed so far away but I did make it there. I could hear his voice in my head 'remember when you are on your own, you will have to be more careful'. I would never be able to face him if I went backwards. I had to rest quite a long time before I could go off again.</p>

<p align=left>I hunted and hunted but without my golden one near by to keep me company while I rested I did not feel the same. I did take the opportunity to kick a few creatures since he was not around. That did make me feel good for a short while thinking of how he would give me that stern look made me laugh. I did make good progress, but I am just not motivated to push myself. Perhaps tomorrow I will feel like hunting more but for now I think I will just wander about.</p>
