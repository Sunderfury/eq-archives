<p align=left><b>Asylum</b><br><i>by Xirius Trembley</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A silent wind swept across the dunes of Northern Ro, causing the jackals to raise their noses to the air. The scent of pain and suffering was evident this day, even to those with senses less acute. The shaman stood atop the dunes, but could only watch as the jackals hunted the corpses of those less fortunate. Pondering the lives of those who fell by his side, the shaman realized there was nothing left in him to give. He had turned away from those who cared for him, turned away from his inner self. Gazing into the horizon for a sense of belonging only proved to be futile. Slowly he walked down the dune knowing that his ship would come to port this eve.</p>

<p align=left>Always a constant, the cutthroats and beggars littered the gates of Freeport. But for the first time, the shaman walked past the gate unbothered. Perhaps they noticed the glazed look in his eyes, or the unyielding way in which he walked. Yet he stopped suddenly at the sight of a familiar face running towards him.</p>

<p align=left>"G'dad! Me been lookin' all ova fer ya!" exclaimed the young Azxira with a smile.</p>

<p align=left>Xirius smiled and rested his right hand on her shoulder. "I had a feeling that I'd run into you here. But the streets of Freeport are no place for you to hang out."</p>

<p align=left>"But me gettin' bigga evra day!" shouted Azxira sharply. "Are we goin' orc huntin' now?"</p>

<p align=left>"I'm afraid not little one," answered Xirius in a solemn tone. "I will be boarding a ship tonight, and going on a long voyage."</p>

<p align=left>"Then me come with ya," replied Azxira defiantly.</p>

<p align=left>Xirius closed his eyes to fight back the emotion tearing at his heart. Every battle he ever fought paled in comparison to the battle raging inside him. But his decision was made, and he knew it was for the betterment of everyone.</p>

<p align=left>"That won't be possible little one. Besides, there is much for you to accomplish here," said Xirius with a heavy heart.</p>

<p align=left>"Me no understand. Wot 'bout me trainin'? Wot's goin' on?" cried Azxira.</p>

<p align=left>Xirius gently wiped the tears from her cheek and took hold of her hands.</p>

<p align=left>"Someday, little one. Someday you will clear my name in the eyes of the Tribunal. Your mother will know when the time is right, and she will guide you. Until then, know that I will always be watching over you."</p>

<p align=left>Sitting by the docks, the shaman listened intently to the waves along the shoreline. The sounds of the sea cleared his mind, but could not cleanse his soul. Staring into the scarred palms of his hands brought back memories of his childhood, playing in Halas, and running lost in the frozen white plains of Everfrost. Wondering if he would ever return to the plains only brought more pain to his heart. He could almost hear the icy winds beckon him relentlessly. Lifting his head, he saw the ship docked and ready for boarding.</p>

<p align=left>The shaman dearly hoped that his friends would understand his decision. Knowing that he was able to influence a few good people was of little consequence, for he would always be judged by his final actions and words. Clenching his fists he made his way towards the ship, feeling a powerful ache in his chest with each step. At the base of the plank, he slowly turned his head to the wind and whispered, "Farewell."</p>
