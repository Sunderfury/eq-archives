<p align=left><b>Legends of the North</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Hot breath upon cold glass, and a window becomes a child’s canvas. Tiny fingers skate upon the surface, tracing lines in the fog. Under the meticulous gaze of two small dark eyes, crude shapes begin to emerge. Here a mammoth – see the tusks, papa? Here a giant – he is as tall as a mountain! Wolves, bears, spiders and goblins all swarm across the misty windowpane. Here, a lone warrior standing brave and tall against them all. </p>

<p align=left>The child stopped for a moment, and looked at the battlefield he had drawn. Never once did he think about impossible odds. Never once did he question the outcome. He traced a line from the man to the mammoth, and while making small explosive noises, he smudged the mammoth into non-existence. Next to fall was the wolf, then the giant. One by one, the creatures all fell to the magic of the hero at the center.</p>

<p align=left>He had been young, then, and had barely known how to make letters and cement them together into words. So it was that he had misspelled the name of the valiant warrior who had faced such impossible odds, and the foggy window bore the inscription: “Zereis”.</p>

<p align=left>No matter how it was spelled, the name was a legend among his people. Only a few of the North folk knew how to read; instead, most of their knowledge and lore was passed through spoken words, through tales told over warm campfires on dark winter nights. Stories of heroes and legends, stories that inspired and filled the villagers with hope. They knew, of course, that they would probably never do battle with an ice giant, nor would they ever see the mythical caverns of Permafrost. But they took comfort in the stories of these brave warriors who had fought – and always would fight – to protect Halas from the marauders of Blackburrow and Permafrost. At night, as the villagers huddled safe and warm beneath their bearskins, they whispered prayers of thanks to those heroic souls who yet wander the frozen night, ever vigilant against the many threats to their homeland.</p>

<p align=left>It had been many years since Zoldt had first heard the tales. He was a young man, now, and well on his way to becoming a Shaman of his people. But he still carried with him all of the legends and lessons of his youth, all the tales told by white-maned elders to the young, so that they would never forget the names of those men and women who had fought and bled for the sake of the North folk. The legends burned in his heart like an undying torch, filling him with the hope that his own name might one day be remembered alongside that of Xirius Trembley, Shaman of Halas.</p>

<p align=left>And though it was rumored that Xirius had met with some terrible end, Zoldt steadfastly refused to believe it. He imagined the legendary shaman still walking somewhere out there, in the frozen dark of Everfrost, still defending his ancient northern home. And though he was yet young, Zoldt hoped that he would one day meet this great warrior, who had been an inspiration to him ever since he had been old enough to draw epic battles upon cold windows at night.</p>
