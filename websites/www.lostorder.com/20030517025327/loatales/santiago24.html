<p align=left><b>By Hook Or By Crook</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Christmas Eve. All over the world, children were tossing and turning in their beds, wondering what sorts of presents would be waiting for them underneath the tree tomorrow morning. To them, each hour until dawn would be a source of sleepless, impatient torment. Their parents, on the other hand, could relax at last. All the shopping was finally over, and tomorrow would be a day away from work. Husbands and wives wrapped their arms around each other and smiled, thinking of the joy that tomorrow would bring to their children. It was a magical night, of breathless anticipation and quiet joy. For most people, that is…</p>

<p align=left>Santiago shivered and muttered a curse as he dug his oars into the water. “Would o’ been cold enough without the bloody rain,” he said, to no one in particular. “This be winter, right? Ain’t it s’posed to be snowin’?” But even as miserable as he was, he had to admit that the grey weather would help to conceal his little rowboat from any watching eyes. So he pulled the brim of his old floppy hat lower over his forehead and tried to ignore the growing ache in his shoulders from rowing and constantly shivering. </p>

<p align=left>There was only one warship in the bay, though several more were no doubt anchored nearby. Santiago kept well away from the ship, but gazed longingly at the light coming from its portholes. It would have been warm and dry below deck. The men would either be sleeping, reading or playing at cards. He had spent many a night cloistered in such quarters, while rain and thunder plagued the air outside. And here he was now, all alone on a tiny rowboat, cold and soaking wet, creeping closer and closer to a town full of enemies who would kill him on sight.</p>

<p align=left>And again, he asked himself why. Why not just turn back to the Peregrine, where it was safe and warm? Why not set sail for some small, out-of-the-way tropical isle – maybe shack up somewhere with a pretty young woman, and just plain vanish for a while? Then, a few months down the road, when his enemies had forgotten all about him – then he could return to the world. Why not leave all this cold and misery behind?</p>

<p align=left>But he couldn’t, not while the kingdom was in danger. True, it was only a rumor, but one of his oldest friends had been murdered to keep that ‘rumor’ silent. Santiago could not…would not let his death go in vain. Even now, he could feel the faint pulse of the dagger beneath his cloak, a dagger full of eldritch enchantments that would lead him to his enemy. The course had been set, and there would be no turning back.</p>

<p align=left>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p align=left>If you could see through the visor of Dunstan’s metal helmet, you would see the most perfect example of how disgust can ruin a face. The forehead was so deeply wrinkled with vexation that you might have thought a farmer had recently plowed it to lay seeds. The eyes, so commonly called the windows of the soul, had narrowed into slits that no enemy arrow could hope to penetrate. And the mouth – well, you might easily have guessed that he had recently been made to eat something very sour.</p>

<p align=left>“This is ridiculous,” said the soldier to himself, for there was no one else to hear his complaints. “Here I am, standing guard at a wall that no one’s ever going to attack. And on Christmas Eve, no less. Who would attack Trinsic the night before Christmas? No one, that’s who. I don’t have time for this. I still got presents to wrap! How I’m gonna get everything ready by tomorrow morning, I have no idea. But if I don’t, my wife’s going to kill me – or at least whack me on the head with that frying pan of hers. On second thought, I kinda hope the orcs do attack tonight; at least that would give me an excuse. Besides, I’d rather go up against their swords than that darn frying pan.”</p>

<p align=left>He leaned over the parapet and peered below, hardly expecting to see anything other than rain, fog and shadow. But to his surprise, mixed in with the rain, fog and shadow, there was also a tiny wooden rowboat, in which sat a rather shady-looking character who looked as though he was preparing some sort of grappling hook.</p>

<p align=left>“Well, I’ll be darned,” said Dunstan. It wasn’t exactly an orc horde, but if he could put a stop to this would-be trespasser, then maybe the captain would promote him. And a promotion would mean more money, and more money might help to smooth things over with his wife. After all, there was nothing she enjoyed so much as spending his own money – except perhaps clubbing him over the head with heavy kitchen utensils. With these thoughts in mind, he loaded his heavy crossbow and took aim at the nefarious intruder below.</p>

<p align=left>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p align=left>In his struggle to secure the rope to the grappling hook (which involved a great deal of muttered curses and threats), Santiago did not notice the guardsman at the wall above, nor did he realize that a deadly crossbow bolt was about to be launched at him.</p>

<p align=left>At last he finished tying the knot, just as a loud CRACK sounded from above. Something thudded into the wooden rowboat just couple of inches from his leg.</p>

<p align=left>“Cripes…now thar’s hail comin’ down. What next, eh?” He hoisted the grappling hook and began to twirl it through the air in widening circles. Then, with a grunt, he released it and watched as it traveled upward into the darkness, toward what he hoped was the castle parapet.</p>

<p align=left>A second later, he heard a loud metal ‘clang’, followed by what sounded like a human scream. Santiago dismissed it as the call of some miserable bird caught outside in the night rain, and decided to test the rope’s reliability. He jumped up in the air, putting all of his weight on the hook.</p>

<p align=left>And again, there was a loud scream, only this time it seemed to be coming toward him. It was a near thing, but he managed to dodge out of the way just in time as a metal-clad warrior smashed into the ground at the base of the castle wall.</p>

<p align=left>“Blimey…that had to hurt,” said Santiago. He ran over to inspect the fallen soldier, who had a grappling hook stuck in him. “He’s out cold, poor bloke…but still breathin’.” There was a sudden burst of lightning and thunder, and Santiago gazed up at the wall, wondering if any other guards were up there. He was not looking forward to this – climbing up a wet, slippery rope only to find an armed soldier waiting for him up top. Then he looked again at the unconscious warrior on the ground, and an idea began to form in his ol’ noggin.</p>

<p align=left>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p align=left>“Dunstan, where the heck have you been? We’ve been looking all over for you!”</p>

<p align=left>A figure in dirty, dented armor stumbled slowly toward the city gates, where a crowd of soldiers had gathered. “Ar! Sorry ‘bout that, mateys…ye ain’t never gonna b’lieve what happened. I done fell off the darn wall!”</p>

<p align=left>There was a round of laughter among the guardsmen. “Drinking already, eh? Well that serves you right, then. You’re lucky you weren’t killed!”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye, thar’s the truth. Say…ye think it would be awright if I went on over to the ol’ healer’s shop?”</p>

<p align=left>“Sure, go ahead, you drunkard. Oh, by the way, your wife was looking for you, too. She didn’t look too happy, either. Come to think of it, maybe you were unlucky not to get killed!”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago stumbled away from the laughing soldiers and entered the nearest dark alley he could find. There he hurriedly stripped off the heavy armor and stashed it away in an old barrel. A few minutes later, a beggar clad in old rags set forth from the alleyway and entered the city of Trinsic.</p>
