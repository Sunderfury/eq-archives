<p align=left><b>The Life of Corwin</b><br><i>by Corwin</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Corwin was named after his father, a man who seemingly danced among the shadows, never to be found where one thought.  Dara, a fair maiden returning to Britain after a day of harvesting crops, she found herself accosted by a roaming tribe of orcs.  Dropping her days work, she fled in panic, blindly stumbling towards what she thought was town, but instead turned out to be the soft glow of a passing wisp.  Surrounded by savage beasts, Dara prepared for the death she knew was coming.  But then, out of nowhere, a man with a black cape clasped with a silver rose appeared, bright sword in hand, to do battle with the beasts.  His blade flashed and howls of agony could be heard for miles, as orcs died, and what few remained quickly fled.  Dara, weak from her plight, succumbed to the darkness of unconsciousness.</p>
	
<p align=left>She awoke in town, safe and sound in her bed, with her mother and father watching over her.  Her parents had thanked the stranger whole-heartedly, and had offered him food and rest in their home, but he refused, saying that he was staying at the North Side Inn.</p>
	
<p align=left>When she was fully rested, Dara packed a basket and went to the Inn to thank the stranger.  He greeted her at the door, and welcomed her to his suite, all the willing to eat and drink and be social.  Thus she heard a bit of his story.</p>
	
<p align=left>He said his name was Corwin and he was from a city called Amber, a city that Dara had never heard of.  She said so, which drew a chuckle from him, "It is far away, Lady.  Quite far indeed." It was obvious to Dara that he was of noble lineage, which he made no effort to dispute.  After some urging, and a bit of wine, he was a bit more forthcoming with his story.  He was of a royal family, but the kingdom was in turmoil, as several of the Princes of Amber vied for the throne.  Corwin, having recently escaped imprisonment, meant to secure his claim to the throne, saying nothing more than that he was on the Road to Avalon, where he would find what was needed to guarantee his crown.</p>
	
<p align=left>Mayhap it was the wine.  Perchance it was the nobility of a stranger.  It might have just been his smile.  Dara was falling in love.</p>
	
<p align=left>Four days later, Corwin was making ready to continue his journey.  After days of conversation and food and drink, the thought of him leaving was too much for Dara.  She could read in him the desire for her, and it was mirrored in her own eyes.  In the end, before he left, they gave something of themselves to each other, a passion and a lust for life.</p>
	
<p align=left>A boy was born of this, and Dara named him for his father, Corwin.</p>

<p align=left>Corwin, the boy, grew up in the finest institutes of Britannia.  Classically trained in all the fake graces, music, literature, warfare, he was priveliged.  It was odd that the son of an unmarried daughter of a farmer would receive such schooling, but soon after his birth, an Official from Lord British came to Dara and her parents. He declared that by order of Lord British himself, the boy was to be cared for, and to want for nothing in his life.</p>
	
<p align=left>On his twenty-first birthday, Corwin was making his way from Britain to the Empath Abbey in Yew, delivering several tomes to the friars there.  Along the way, he stumbled across the path of an enraged grizzly bear.  The beast set upon Corwin with speed and there was hardly time to even draw his sword.  Armor ripped to shreds, and partially dazed by several blows, Corwin truly fought for his life.</p>
	
<p align=left>"Hail friend!  Might we be of assistance?" came a call from the woods.</p>
	
<p align=left>Two figures stepped from the woods, dressed in armor and bearing the look of fighting men.</p>
	
<p align=left>"Aye!" Corwin gasped. "I fear the beast has the better of me!"</p>
	
<p align=left>As one the two warriors broke into action.  Swords and shields were drawn, and they closed on the wild bear.  Immediately falling into their rhythm, Corwin renewed his attack on the bear, and as a team they put the creature to rest.</p>
	
<p align=left>Corwin thanked the two men for their timely aid and asked of their destination.  They were bound for Yew, they said, to meet with others of their Guild before setting sail for uncharted waters.  That is how Corwin met Joxer the Mighty, and his companion Palehorse.</p>
	
<p align=left>They traveled together to Yew, and on the way Corwin learned of The Lost Order of Akalabeth.  He asked of its ideals and philosophies, and was soon impressed by what he heard.  Upon arrival to Yew, Corwin delivered the tomes he had been entrusted with, and made way with Joxer and Palehorse to the House of the Architects, the guildhall of the Order.  He met many more LOA there, and soon pledged himself to the Order.</p>
	
<p align=left>After many years of service, Corwin took the title of Lord of Diplomacy for the LOA, and accepted a seat on the Council.  While he has yet to find love, he has had many adventures, and a lifetime of memories.</p>
