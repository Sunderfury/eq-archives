<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Sixteen</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I have just said good-bye to my golden one and am sitting here looking out upon the water. </p>

<p align=left>Today I had an interesting group. The 'leader' wanted me to melee instead of meditate to heal the group. He wanted this so much so that even though I called 'on me' several times he just asked 'Azzy why aren't you helping'. It went against every thing I have learned and stood there and whacked them death beetles. It was enough there were three warriors and one druid in the group to even think if I could have kept them all healthy. Luckily nothing else joined in as all were below half health. </p>

<p align=left>I healed myself up, as I was also below half health and cast invisibility vs. undead upon myself so that I would be somewhat safe. I told them that I was at 10% and they wanted to pull. I told them it would be unwise since I didn't even have the chance to complete the casting my protective spells on the warriors before they began to pull. I intentionally distributed the healing slowly amongst all of them, even though they were complaining they had no buffs. I meditated till full then to time my buffs started casting on myself then the tanks. By the time I had finished I was below half in mana. Of course they didn't wait and proceeded to go to the room in the back. </p>

<p align=left>I got in the room and found myself a corner and watched their health. Finally the battle done I told them that I needed to med. Luckily one person in the group knew the value of letting me med and so I got to sit a little longer. This little gnome warrior was too impatient and sometimes would pull a manageable few but then one time pulled 8 ghouls and a couple of skeletons. One in our group ran. This gnome went out the back door with the druid trying to keep him alive which left me in the room with the two warriors and 6 ghouls. I managed to keep them alive and with some mana to spare. The one warrior was attentive and taunted creatures when I called 'on me' and I made sure he was the one I took care of best as my golden one instructed. At the end this little gnome warrior declared 'we rock' and came the time to where our group began to break up. The one that ran decided to leave the group. Another so badly beaten he was down to one bubble but was hiding somewhere. </p>

<p align=left>We added another cleric to our group but then I think that caused over confidence since the gnome wanted a skeletal monk. He did get that and about 20 other creatures it seemed. I did not survive and when I heard that the one warrior who was watching over me was leaving I just let them know my instructor was coming and would have to leave when he did. I know it was a lie, but a small one at least. </p>

<p align=left>My golden one came and his time was short. He bestowed upon me a new bracer that would add to my strength. After that he told me his mother had received the letter he had sent her and I would be meeting her soon. He just had to set up a time so that she would not be working and I would not be in the middle of a battle some time. He asked me how far till my next circle and I told him that despite my death today I was only a bubble and a half away. He then asked me if I purchased my next set of spells yet. Of course I hadn't. He got a stern look on his face, which melted into a smile and just said that we would have a short lesson this eve. It was to purchase the next set of spells when coming within half way there, that there is nothing more frustrating to yourself and your group when you can't cast them right away. I told him that I would do that before I begin my next hunt. </p>

<p align=left>We said our good-byes as we have grown accustom to and then he was off to go to Kaladim to sleep. Thinking about it now, I should have walked with him but the sunset is so pretty this eve that I thought it would help me write. I guess it is the time alone with out him and him leaving so soon that my heart feels so heavy. Looking at the beauty of the sunset and knowing that when the sun rises it will be a new day and my golden one will return has helped settle me a bit. Ah well, the sooner I rest, the sooner he will return. </p>
