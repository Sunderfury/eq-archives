<p align=left><b>An Open Mind</b><br><i>by Lady Gwen</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The Sun Streamed into the dank Laboratory only to be diffused by the thick smoke of smoldering Mandrake Root. Over by the window Gwendolyn sat in her chair lost in the words of the tome she had recently obtained. It had ancient text in it that told of the magic used by those who had first discovered the Arcane Arts. Her fingers slowly followed the manuscript trying to make sense of it. </p>

<p align=left>Since dabbling in the arts herself she had become intrigued with magery and its many components and uses. She had found this tome in a small out of the way stand in Vesper. The dealer wanted virtually nothing for it, as he did not know what it was and could not decipher it. Gwen did however, and did not waste anytime in purchasing the ancient volume. Long days and nights were spent trying to read the tome. Slowly after time she had managed to decipher most of the text. She was now studying some of the spells that the book referenced and their components. Being particularly interested in spells that were offensive in nature, she had found one that had held her interest. The tome described it as Mind Mayhem…</p>

<p align=left>Going over to her chest of reagents she pulled the ingredients for the spell and placed them on the table next to the 20 units of sulfur already out. Going over to her desk again looking through the text to get the mantra. She committed it to memory and walked back over to the reagents and picked them up, her hand brushing the top of the pile sulfur. The sulfur cascading closer to the flame that kept a copper plate hot. Turning to a caged Sewer rat she began to put herself at ease and concentrate. Opening her eyes slowly she began to speak the words that most certainly would mean the loss of the rat's Sanity (if they have any at all).</p>

<p align=left>"Mmsen'alka Por wha'tu invo…" Pfffffssssssssssssssttttt…What ensued was nothing short of extraordinary. Those standing outside were knocked over from the concussion of the blast. The windows were blown out and the door to the back room was in splinters. The sound of the blast was heard for several leagues in all directions. People even in Yew were reported as hearing the explosion. Those of the Lost Order who came to her aid found a room in ruins. The glass containers and all breakables were destroyed. The table that held the Sulfur had been split in two and was severly charred. The smell of sulfur permeated the air. Frantically Searching for Gwen her rescuers found her beneath her desk, the blast had thrown her nearly 8 feet across the room and into her desk. The impact of her body hitting the desk having destroyed it. The Rat had not been so lucky and had been killed by the concussion, blood running out of its ears. Rolling her over to find out if she had been killed as well all were relieved to see her chest heave with great effort. Everyone in that room then heard something quite incredible. They heard her speak but not with her mouth, They heard her speak to them in their heads.</p>

<p align=left>"Ohhhhhhh my head…what happened?" Everyone looked at each other, puzzled looks on their faces. </p>

<p align=left>"Did you hear that." Asked one to the other. "Aye I did matey but I thourght it twas my imganimation." "We had better get tha lass outside into the fresh ahrr'e." With that the pirate helped pick her up and the others cleared a path for him to walk out of the room to the front and out into the fresh air. </p>

<p align=left>"Gwen, Gwen you alright?" Slowly opening her eyes she saw her friends standing around her. "What happened?"</p>

<p align=left>"It appears milady that you had an accident, what were you doing in thar?"</p>

<p align=left>"I was attempting to cast a new spell that I had found in a tome I recently acquired, it was called Mind Mayhem."</p>

<p align=left>"Well lass," said the other member "it appears it packed quite a punch, maybe you should stay away from magic, eh?"</p>

<p align=left>Gwen's mind raced, no, the spell was not suppose to do that, She thought for a second and began to put the pieces together. </p>

<p align=left>"No it twasn't the spell, I think what happened was the sulfur on the table caught fire and caused the explosion, I was in mid-stream of casting the spell, so it couldn't have been the spell that caused the explosion."</p>

<p align=left>The Pirate Spoke, "Milady, I am no expert in thar magic stuff but me thinks that yer spell may have back fer'd on ya." The others nodded in agreement. "Ya see we heard yer thourghts back in thar room." </p>

<p align=left>Her mind once again raced, "how could this be," she thought.</p>

<p align=left>"Gwen, we heard that…"</p>
