<p align=left><b>The Old Eastern Road</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Never travel the Old Eastern Road at night, they said.</p>

<p align=left>‘They’ said a lot of things. Don’t go into the woods when there’s a full moon. Always speak politely about the dead, because they might still be listening. During his childhood, Giles had been given many such warnings. It was a litany taught to each and every child, a lesson of fear and superstition handed down from generation to generation. Fear the darkness, they said, for that is where evil hides.</p>

<p align=left>Giles had long ago decided that it was all nonsense. He didn’t consider himself foolish or reckless; he took care to lock his door at night, and kept a sword by his bed just in case. But wreaths of garlic? Holy symbols to keep away evil spirits? Ridiculous. He would smile politely when they told their stories, by the light of the fire on a cold night at the tavern. He would watch as their eyes grew wide, glancing around nervously at the shadows. They were simple people – peasants, farmers and laborers for the most part. Not only did they fear things like death and evil – they crafted an entire mythos around them, giving a supernatural embodiment to their fears. Ghosts and goblins, witches and werewolves - a collection of legends that had somehow transformed from fantasy to fact over the years. But not for Giles. He admired the imagination that had gone into such stories, but that’s all they were to him – stories.</p>

<p align=left>But sometimes he wasn’t so sure. Times like now, as he walked alone along the Old Eastern Road, the sun a sinking, dying red in the sky behind him. Gone were the crowds of Britain. Gone were the old, familiar buildings, the comforts of warmth and shelter. His accustomed, well-known world had vanished, and he now found himself alone in a remote, dark forest full of growing shadows.</p>

<p align=left>And slowly, his starch cynicism began to falter. Tree branches creaked ominously in the chill wind, like skeletal wooden arms. The mournful howl of a lone wolf echoed eerily through the trees, sending a chill up his spine. Somewhere a twig snapped – was someone out there? He stopped and scanned the woods. Bandits or thieves, perhaps? Or something else? He shook his head and told himself that it was just imagination, using the darkness to prey upon his fears. But somehow it didn’t help. Try as he might, he could not shake away the feeling that something was out there, watching him.</p>

<p align=left>He decided to set camp for the night. The fire helped to allay his nervousness, and he took great comfort in the tiny source of light and warmth. Still, it was a long time before he fell asleep. And when he did at last tumble away from consciousness, his dreams were not peaceful ones.</p>
