<p align=left><b>The Passing of the Hammer</b><br><i>by Keeshi</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The old mage's eyes blinked rapidly. Despite the countless times he had traveled the planes of magic, mystical transportation still made him a bit disorientated upon arrival at his desired location. He looked carefully about, sense alert for both friend and foe. Feeling only peace he gazed more intently at his surroundings. How long had it been since he had last set foot at this place? A majestic two-story stood before him, a few smaller buildings were set about around him. He smiled knowingly. The smaller houses contained the true power in the area, but that was a thought he would have to put on hold for just a bit longer. With steady strides he ascended the stone stairs and knocked once on the stout oaken door. Silently it opened inward, as if the door itself knew to let him enter. He stepped within slowly glancing at the shadowy corners. No one was about, as it should be. The building itself recognized one of it's own and allowed him access to it's hallowed halls. He removed his sandals and walked purposely to the back room. His feet tingled as the mystical energies of the room filled him with both awe and a sense of belonging. Had he been an uninvited guest, he would be merely a pile of ash upon the same wooden boards. </p>

<p align=left>In mere seconds he reached the center of the barren room, devoid of both light and sound the eeriness of the place would cause even the strongest of wills to break had the structure desired it so. Smiling once again to himself he knelt on one knee and uttered the words known by very few others. The shadows consumed him and he felt himself falling upwards, despite the laws of nature. The seconds seemed like hours as both his soul and body fought to maintain control. Suddenly his eyes were assaulted by blinding light; again he blinked, this time to regain his sight. The room slowly came into focus. He was in a long corridor, lit by unseen sources and decorated on each side by trophies of war. With measured steps he proceeded down the hall, his eyes shifting from one item to another as the memories of countless battles haunted him. With each step he felt stronger, younger, and surer of his purpose in life. He knew this to be the work of the artifacts contained within and disregarded the sensations of valor and courage that assailed him. After all, he was too old for such things. Now was the time for the younger, the stronger, the more dedicated.</p>

<p align=left>An immense iron door stood before him and he raised his hand slowly palm forward, stopping mere inches from the cool solid surface. A pale blue aura engulfed the door and it faded out of existence. Stepping through the portal he once more took a moment to view his surroundings. The chamber was vast indeed; it's only ornamentations where four pedestals, three of which held items, the last one ominously empty, and an altar of white marble. He walked to the first pedestal and gazed sorrowfully at the item atop it. A large war hammer, it's shaft broken lay there. He reached his hand out reluctantly, his hand stopping before he could touch the item. The entire weapon was black now, a sign of the shame the former owner had brought upon himself. His gazed shifted to the bronze plague, which should by rights be engraved with the name of the hero who once wielded it, and his title as a Lord. However such was not the case with this one. The plague read simply: Traitor of the Order. Sighing to himself the mage continued forward. The next pedestal also held a broken War Hammer. This one however gleamed as light refracted off its silver surface. Again his hand stretched forward his fingers tracing lines across the Hammer's face. "Maraxus my mate. God speed to ye in thy new undertakin's." The mages whispered carried throughout the chamber. He said a silent prayer to himself and stepped forward once again. The third pedestal stood before him now. The War Hammer on its perch was also cracked in twine. It too radiated, however it's light shone green to the mages eyes. His hand shot forward without pause and grasped the broken weapon. As his fingers touched the broken shaft the weapon repaired itself. Once more becoming whole. Taking a step back he twirled the hammer about. It's weight unfelt in his hand. How long ago had this been given unto him? Now was not the time for such thoughts. He took a pace forward and replaced the weapon to its resting place. As the metal touched the pedestal the shaft once again split in to. "My time is over mate. 'as been fer a long time. Yet my blood still pumps wit the lessons ye taught me." He stood now before the empty pedestal and once more a frown came to his face. "I do so 'ate that this must occur. I remember when I 'anded the lass the weapon. Ah, but she is right. Now is the time fer blood even younger then 'ers." Smiling again he moved towards the altar.</p>

<p align=left>As he approached he noticed the only other person within the chamber. The figure knelt before the altar, giving silent prayer to who knows which god. " 'ello lass. I knew this day would one day come. Though I 'adn't thought it would be quite this soon. Ye 'ave done the Order much 'onor in the post Gabrielle, are ye sure this is the course ye wish to take?" The mage's voice softened as he spoke to his long time friend.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye Keeshi, such is my right, and my desire. I no longer wish to lead. The guild needs a new leader for this post. Shall we begin?" The assassin's eyes glowed crimson as she spoke. Keeshi felt her words more then heard them, for they came truly from her heart.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye lass. Tis time, did ye bring the item?" The mage asked though the question was futile. Of course she had brought it, just as he had brought his so very long ago. "Come now to the pedestal, where we shall conduct the ritual."</p>

<p align=left>Gabrielle stepped quietly to the assigned position. The mage was in awe of how silently she moved. He seemed to be as loud as an orc army in comparison. Then again, his profession and hers were entirely different. "Place the 'ammer thar m'dear." She did as instructed without word, and stepped to face her comrade. The two spoke the ancient words. Words, which shatter reality and recreate it. She then turned and faced the item atop the pedestal. Keeshi stepped forward and placed his index finger gently upon the shaft of the weapon. With agonizing slowness he traced a line downward, it blazed with pale green light. Stepping back he nodded towards his friend and watched as she stood before the weapon.</p>

<p align=left>"And so it shall be!" Her words boomed nearly shattering the mages ear drums. Her hand came down in a chopping motion, cracking the shaft in two. The break was clean however, as though it had been the slice of a perfectly wielded blade. Stepping back she watched closely as the hammer began to glow red. Sighing she turned her head and looked back to the altar. There stood another War Hammer, this one as whole and as solid as the one she had just destroyed. Keeshi tapped her on the shoulder gently and pointed towards the new pedestal that had appeared. "One day lass, 'e too shall turn over the post, do ye swear to aid 'im when the time comes?" His words came to her mind rather then being spoken aloud. </p>

<p align=left>"Aye friend I shall." Her response was short but conveyed much.</p>

<p align=left>"Then go now, find Mckenna, and pass on the mantel. My job 'ere is done. Tell the lad I wish 'im well. If 'e needs me aid. I shall give it, as I know ye shall as well. Until we meet again lass." The mage spoke the words of magic and disappeared from the chamber, leaving the former Lord of the Hammer with her new duty. </p>
