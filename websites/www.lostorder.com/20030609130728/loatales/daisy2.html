<p align=left><b>Shopping</b><br><i>by Daisy</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The bright girl in blue happily skipped across the cobblestone road taking notice to all the flowers she saw as she traveled. The trees were all in their winter slumber and the woodland creatures were also gone, yet the flowers bloomed. Her basket bounced and her hair flowed as she walked the path, she could see in the distance between the trees the winery and the abbey, she jingled her coin bag and smiled. She walked right up to the winery hesitent she looked back and forth then walked in wipeing her feet. She was overwhelmed by the sights, sounds, and magnificent smells of the winery. She span around taking her surroundings in.</p>

<p align=left>She greeted the shopkeep with a smile "Hello sir, can I get a bottle of champane and 2 bottles of Chau...Chautn..."</p>

<p align=left>The shop keep interrupted "Chautney's Fine Ale?"</p>

<p align=left>The girl noded and smiled "Thanks Sir"</p>

<p align=left>He smiled back and fiddled around under the counter looking for the 3 drinks "Ermmm...Hmmm...One second Mam' Ill check the back"</p>

<p align=left>"Oh, Ok"</p>

<p align=left>She sat down on the benches but not long being so amazed by this place she began to inspect the walls and the pictures, she was estatic. She looked at a singular grape sitting on the counter, she approched and quickly snached it up and ate it---Her face twiched and she turned 3 shades of green before spitting it out.</p>

<p align=left>She was laughing histerically "Ewwwwww, hehehehheeh, cucky!" she countinued laughing then stoped---Her world turned grey and she looked around fircely "No! Not again! Please not again!" The wall started to melt and the counter faded from veiw and as she looked at her flower basket all her flowers had wilted "NO!" She screamed louder, then........the whispers came, she tried to hold her head and scream but the whispers could not be drowned out, they pecked at her mind, shrill reminders of the past becking her, taunting her, making her cry. And one...only one whisper was audible "Guald...what *are* you doing? Why are you here? Why are you wearing fine clothing!?"</p>

<p align=left>The girl threw herself around holding her head "No! No No No! My Names Daisy! IT IS IT IS! IM JUST SHOPPING! YOU AREN'T REAL! I BOUGHT THESE CLOTHES! GET AWAY! PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE!</p>

<p align=left>"Oh Please, Daisy? Thats a pretty name! Can you do it justice!? You are just a slave! You cannot live up to your sister! You are a dog! How can you walk among people!? YOU ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE WORLD!</p>

<p align=left>The girl stood up wiped her tears and looked around in her world of grey and blacks "I AM DAISY! IM BEAUTIFUL! IM NOT A DOG! NOOO! WHERE ARE YOU!? TELL ME! WHERE ARE YOU KNAVE!</p>

<p align=left>A voice answered "Ummm...Behind you Mam'"</p>

<p align=left>The woman in blue turned around and tackeled the form knocking it to the ground "I will kill you!" She wrapped her hands around the persons throat and countinously slammed it's head off the rock floor, she held her grip until the body was limp and then let go.</p>

<p align=left>The girls world went back to color and everything was fine...she dusted off her dress reached into the coin bag and payed the shopkeep for the drinks, she picked up her shopping bag of alcohol smiled and walked out in the sunlight.</p>

<p align=left>* * * *</p>

<p align=left>The body of the shopkeep had been dead for 2 days until discovered. He had been battered and strangled and layed on the floor of his winery. The only noticeable feature was the grey line on his forehead which, soon after, was dismissed as a tile marking off the floor. So the shopkeep lay in a pile of his own blood for 2days in his shop which he tended for years, he lay there in shame, badly decayed, waiting to be buried. </p>
