<p align=left><b>An Encrypted Note</b><br><i>by Drachiero</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Calixy,</p>

<p align=left>It is considered a sign of weakness for a Teir'Dal to grant forgiveness, or to ask for it. Nevertheless, please know that I bear no anger toward you for your absence last evening, nor for the absence of any other Teir'Dal. Perhaps more than anyone else, I understand the inexorable and unyielding weight of duty, which often keeps us from away from what we want and binds us to what we loathe.</p>

<p align=left>I am pleased to hear that you are alive and well, and I would consider it an honor to fight by your side. There will no doubt be another meeting in Neriak very soon. Until then, may the Dark Goddess conceal you, and grant you the means to strike down your enemies.</p>

<p align=left>- Drachiero, Dark Knight of the Second Tier</p>
