<p align=left><b>Captain's Log: Hunting for Treasure</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Sunday, the sixteenth o’ January, in the Year of our Lard, 2000…</p>

<p align=left>Well, the darn boat is in drydock now, thanks be to the darn fool what calls ‘imself me tillerman. Turns out he had a wee ‘accident’ with the cannon, an’ nearly sank the whole boat. How many times do I have to tell that ol’ bugger: Don’t go shootin’ at mongbats when yer drunk! But it’s like tryin’ to warn the rain not to fall…ye know it’s just gonna happen anyways.</p>

<p align=left>So they got poor Mr. Knife all stitched up in the Abbey (looks just like a mummy – two little holes fer the eyes, an’ one fer the mouth, but somehow he manages to get a bottle of ale through it). The carpenters say it’ll be a good two weeks b’fore me ship is ready to float again. Two weeks?! Crikey…how am I s’posed to keep meself busy fer two weeks in this backwoods little town? Me first thought was to get as smashed as me ship – only, the last o’ me pirate rum went overboard, as well as the gold what would o’ bought more.</p>

<p align=left>Well, thar’s only three things what any pirate needs, an’ the first two (gold an’ booze) weren’t nowhar to be found. So it was high time fer a treasure huntin’ expedition!</p>

<p align=left>Now, I remember that ol’ Elrios went along with me. But I’ll be tarred an’ feathered if I can remember the name o’ the other fella. Memory ain’t never been one o’ me strong suits; I’d prob’ly ferget me own name after a week or two if no one called me by it.</p>

<p align=left>But anyways, the three of us set off fer the Moongate, which I bloody well hate. The ideer o’ jumpin’ into a bright blue fire and windin’ up somewhar else – well, I’m inclined to think I’d wind up in perdition, ‘cause I’d be dead! But as fate would have it, we wound up alive an’ well in Britain (which ain’t exactly perdition, though some folks mought argue ‘bout that).</p>

<p align=left>Elrios an’ the other bloke whose name I can’t remember (I’ll call ‘im Bubba, since I ain’t got ink enough to keep writin’ “the other bloke whose name I can’t remember”), both o’ them were lookin’ confused, like I sometimes do when I wake up in a strange bed. “Why are we in Britain?” they asked. “I thought we were going to go hunting for treasure.”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye, but we are, mateys!” says I. “Just watch…” I looked around the plaza fer a minute, an’ then…lightnin’! I laid eyes upon a perty young lady with hair the color o’ gold. She was wearin’ a long black dress, the kind that seemed to say, “Ahoy thar, Santiago…let’s go someplace quiet so we can take this thing off.” Or maybe I was just hearin’ me own thoughts…so hard to tell, sometimes!</p>

<p align=left>So I saunter on over towards her, an’ I says, “Ahoy thar, milady!” (if I had a gold coin fer every time I said those three words, I’d go an’ buy meself a castle). She throws me a smile what could melt stone, an’ she says, “Hi.” Off to a good start! So I ask if she’s a jester, on account o’ the jingly hat she’s got on. She laughs an’ says that she is. So I ask to hear a joke. Well, she takes a step closer an’ says that the only jokes she knows are dirty ones. So I says, “Well that’s awright, milady…me ears ain’t clean!” (Smooth, ain’t I?) Well, b’fore ye know it, she asks if I’d like to have a drink with her at a nearby tavern.</p>

<p align=left>Meanwhile, Elrios an’ Bubba is just shakin’ their heads. “Look at him go,” says Bubba.</p>

<p align=left>Now, I been starin’ at the wall fer all o’ five minutes now, tryin’ to remember what her name was – but it’s just plain gone. Started with an “M”, methinks. But anyways, she leads me to the Cat’s Lair, an’ then buys me some ale! Now this is my kind o’ lady! Thar’s only one problem with her, an’ when her husband walks through the door, I larn’d what it is. She’s married, darn it! It’s just no good, I tell ye. All the good women has already been caught an’ pulled out o’ the water. A thousand curses upon the fishermen that was quicker than I was!</p>

<p align=left>But the fella is a right good chap, an’ I daresay he’s a better bloke than I’ll ever be. Turns out he was once a pirate, only his boat sank, an’ he ain’t been able to afford a new one. We get to talkin’ an’ drinkin’ an’ laughin’. I dunno what time it was when poor Elrios an’ Bubba walked in, lookin’ as forlorn as can be. Turns out they ain’t had no luck with the ladies. Whenever they try for it, all they get is silence an’ cold shoulders.</p>

<p align=left>Well, I try to give ‘em a few pointers. First, ye got to use “The Line” – somethin’ what makes a lady swoon in the space o’ sixty seconds. Somethin’ like, “Milady, ye ought not to wear that helmet!” She’ll ask why not, an’ ye say, “’Cause it deprives the warld of thy beauty!” An’ then bow or give her flowers or somethin’. Then ye have to ask her things about herself, like whar she lives an’ what she does fer a livin’ (this is the boring part, but if ye manage to stay awake, it’ll pay off later on). Say nice things ‘bout her, even if they ain’t true (“Blimey, milady…that green hat sure is perty!”). If ye keep this up long enough, ye’ll wind up winnin’ her heart. But thar’s a catch to it, ‘cause if ye win a heart an’ then break it, it’s fifty years bad luck, no two ways about it. Me, I got enough bad luck to last fer sev’ral liftetimes!</p>

<p align=left>Anyways, the lady “M” leaves an’ then comes back a few minutes later with some fancy clothes for Elrios. She says that the clothes will make him handsome, an’ the ladies will adore him. An’ with that, he goes back outside to try his luck again. I wish ‘im luck, poor fella…’cause it ain’t easy out thar.</p>

<p align=left>But this was well after midnight, an’ high time fer me to be findin’ a room at the Inn. I passed out, alone in me bed, thinkin’ ‘bout all the strange an’ silly things that men an’ women do, when all that anyone really wants is to sleep in the arms of a loved one.</p>

<p align=left>Sounds simple, don’t it? But thar’s an awful lot o’ souls out thar what sleep alone tonight. If ye ask me, thar ain’t no treasure under the sun what’s more precious than to love an’ be loved. Some folks have it an’ take it fer granted, while others sail to the lonely ends o’ the earth, always lookin’ but never findin’. They say it’s all about fate, an’ luck, an’ bein’ at the right place at the right time, to get struck by lightnin’. But some of us have been outside fer a while now, an’ all we got is rain.</p>
