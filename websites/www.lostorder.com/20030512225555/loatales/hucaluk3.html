<p align=left><b>Froggee Stoo</b><br><i>by Hucaluk</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>We see a large chamber of rough-hewn stone, intermittently punctuated by cobwebs, fungus and little bits of dark green fuzz that can’t quite be identified. A motley assortment of tiny creatures peers through the bars of their cages with large, frightened eyes. There is a large oven in the background, upon which sit a number of blood-stained rags – one of the rags has caught fire and is burning wildly out of control. A number of sharp knives and axes have been buried into the surface of a large table. We hear the thud of approaching footsteps, and then we see a large, ungainly troll waddling up to the kitchen table, wearing a big white chef’s hat and singing a song with unintelligible lyrics:</p>

<p align=left>“Urndee schplurndee gurndee…ork ork ork! Oh, huddo dair. Me Hucaluk an dis iz Hucaluk’s kichin. Dis iz wair Hucaluk mayks yummee stuf. Wot? Yoo not no how? Wel dats ok, me sho yoo!”</p>

<p align=left>“Tooday Hucaluk mayk froggee stoo. Froggee stoo iz gud. Yoo kan kach froggeez in da swomp an eet dem rite uway but day tayst bedder wen yoo kook dem ferst. Bud sumtiemz yoo get hungree an yoo wont to eet dem rite uway. Wel dats ok yoo can doo dat its just kolder dat way an sumtiemz yoo get sik in da tummee.”</p>

<p align=left>“To mayk froggee stoo yoo need a froggee. Me hav wun in dis kaje heer.” Hucaluk opens the door and reaches inside with his giant hand. “Kum owt, froggee! Nise froggee! Hucaluk wont hert yoo! (Day get skaird if yoo tel dem da troof.)”</p>

<p align=left>Suddenly the froglok jumps out and begins hopping around the kitchen. “Heer, froggee froggee froggee! Kum bak…how kan Hucaluk mayk Froggee Stoo if da froggee runz uway?” Hucaluk grabs a club and chases his food off-screen, and the audience hears a loud “THUNK”. The troll returns a moment later holding the froglok by the leg. The unfortunate amphibian has a large bump on its head, and its eyes are locked in a glazed, cross-eyed expression.</p>

<p align=left>“Ok, Hucaluk hav da froggee. Now Hucaluk put da froggee in da stoo.” He dumps the froglok into a small cauldron of boiling water. “An dats how yoo mayk froggee stoo! Yoo can put in sum udder tings like bat wingz an rat eerz if yoo wont. But it tayst gud just like dis.” Hucaluk takes a test sip of his stew. “Mmmmmmmm!”</p>

<p align=left>“Az yoo kan see it iz hard werk to kook tings. Its bedder if yoo kan find a woomin to kook for yoo. Dat way yoo kan hav fun wile shee duz all da werk. Hucaluk go now an see if he kan find a woomin to kook tings for him.” Hucaluk runs off-screen; a moment later, there is a loud “THUNK”. The troll returns a moment later with a large bump on his head, his eyes locked in a glazed, cross-eyed expression.</p>

<p align=left>“Oh wel, dat not go so gud. But dats how yoo mayk froggee stoo. Enny kweschuns? No? Ok gud. Yoo go now. Mayk sum froggee stoo. Hucaluk gonna pass owt now. Buh-bye.” Hucaluk’s eyes close, and he unconsciously topples backward like a falling tree.</p>
