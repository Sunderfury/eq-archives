<blockquote>
<p align=left>Heavy hooves struck the ground at a gallop, as each made contact the vast forest echoed with the sound of thunder. The hooves began to slow and soon came to a complete halt. Slowly the rider dismounted, blackened chain mail jingling slightly in the cool ocean breeze. The figure reached out a slender hand, stroking the deep black mane of the steed. "Thou art indeed a mighty creature my friend, ye do my honor by allowing me to ride ye." The voice sang out, it's melodic tone easing the beast after it's long hard ride. The figure grasped the bridle and led the nightmare towards a patch of freshly gown grass where it began to feed.</p>

<p align=left>The rider gently untied her robe, allowing it to open slightly. In an almost lazy fashion she began to remove the armor underneath. Finally free of the confining metal she breathed easier. Her bare toes reveling at the touch of the dew moistened grass. She allowed her mind to relax, her senses stretched out, communing with the nature about her. Suddenly her head jerked forward, her eyes opened fully and she began to look about frantically. The invisible hairs upon her neck stood on end as she felt a creature approaching from the rear. Cautiously she turned about, her delicate fingers slipped unnoticed into a pouch by her side. </p>

<p align=left>Her eyes fell upon a large wolf, nearly half her size yet clearly outweighing her by more then fifty stones. The creature snarled viciously, his maw coated with saliva. Again the woman let her senses reach forward, her attentions focused on the wolf before her. The wolf began to snarl and bark, the noises translating to the common tongue within the woman's head.</p>

<p align=left>"Thou art unlike the others….thou art tiny, but a good snack ye shall make yes…." The creature's snarls became more menacing. It's fiery eyes burned through her, searching for a fear that was not forthcoming. </p>

<p align=left>"There is plenty of food about friend, let us go find some together. There is no need for us to battle, let us become friends." Her normally musical voice deepened, the words came out as snarls and growls, much to her delight.</p>

<p align=left>"I nary can smell thy fear. Are ye ignorant as to what I am about to do to ye child?" The dire wolf snarled again, his anger more then apparent in his gleaming eyes.</p>

<p align=left>"There is nothing to fear mighty one, thou art my cousin, we all are a part of nature. Let us run together, join my pack, fight with me and nary against me?" She half asked, half pleaded.</p>

<p align=left>The wolf evidently thought little of her proposition and sprang forward with the speed and strength given only to those who are ravished by hunger. The woman however was quick to react; she fell backwards, her legs shooting up. As her feet collided with the wolves she shoved with her legs, forcing the wolf to flip over her, landing painfully on its back. Quickly the dire wolf recovered though, and it shot its head forward with blinding speed. Massive fangs sank deep into the woman's bicep, the powerful jaws locking themselves around her arm. The druid however was far from beaten, and even further from deciding it was time to hurt the creature. Her left arm came forward, her fingers finding the fleshy area between the creature's jaw. As the wolf began to shake its head (hoping to tear off a good hunk of flesh for consuming) she exerted all her force into the tender muscles, causing the jaw to open. </p>

<p align=left>Still holding the creature's maw she examined her arm, blood flowed freely but she saw no need for alarm. "Now friend," she stated calmly. "Please do nay make me hurt ye. Tis nary my intent to cause ye any harm." Just then a great hart leapt into view, sensing the wolf it immediately spun about and prepared to run. The woman's eyes beamed with joy. "Justicar kill!" She stated almost reluctantly, her finger pointing towards the now retreating stag. The powerful nightmare responded instantly, it's enormous legs propelling it faster then the stag could ever dream of moving. Within seconds the beast was upon the hart, its front hooves reared up, then came crashing down upon the poor creatures skull, slaying it instantly. "Shall we partake of this fine venison?" She almost lovingly asked the wolf she still held.</p>

<p align=left>"Perhaps I was wrong to attack ye. Aye, I would love to savor that flesh. However I shall nary join thy pack. We shall simply share a meal." The wolf stated, knowing that battling the woman could only end in his death. The two walked quickly to the downed hart, the woman bowed before it and said a silent prayer of thanks to the creature for giving its life for theirs.</p>

<p align=left>The two ate for quite some time before the carcass was completely bare. Finally the woman turned once more to the massive wolf and asked once more, "Are ye sure ye nary wish to run with me friend? It would be an honor to grow in strength and wisdom with one such as ye."</p>

<p align=left>The wolf peered at her quizzically, then agreed. "What do they call ye friend? I was known as Moon Chaser amongst my former pack.</p>

<p align=left>"Tis a pleasure to meet ye Moon Chaser, my name is Tori, come I shall take ye amongst my friends of the Lost Order, together we shall bring light to this darkened realm." The woman replied smiling. Quickly she leapt atop her steed and began to trot off. "Moon Chaser follow me," were the last words the forest heard for many long hours.</p>
