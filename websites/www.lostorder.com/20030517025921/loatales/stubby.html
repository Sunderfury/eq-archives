<p align=left><b>Of Dungeons and Dragons</b><br><i>by Stubby Grunhard</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The bored group of adventurers sat around Karl's tavern, some tossing daggers at a pitted target against the wall, some half-heartedly wagering coppers in an impromptu dice game. From time to time, one of them would sigh, and glance at the door, wondering when, or if, adventure would come knocking. It had been close to a month since anything exciting had happened, and even the oft-retold stories had become boring, regardless of the embellishments.</p>

<p align=left>Ears perked as hoofbeats broke the silence outside. A rider was coming. Odds were that it was just a farmer, returning from the fields, come to swig a few ales before heading home for the night, but there was always a chance. Five sets of eyes stared at the door, until it swung open.</p>

<p align=left>A young man walked into the tavern, beating dust of the road from his long, flowing, white robe. A dark brown cape drooped from his shoulders. The man peered around the dimly-lit room, letting his eyes become accustomed to the gloom. His eyes fell upon Lexi, a young priestess. His gaze stopped there, a smile creased his face, and he quickly approached her table.</p>

<p align=left>"Milady, I knowest not if thou rememberest me?"</p>

<p align=left>"Hmm, not that I recall..." she responded.</p>

<p align=left>"My name is Calvin, and I hail from Altorath, to the North," he began.</p>

<p align=left>Lexi stalled, searching her mind for the name, the face, or perhaps the clothing.</p>

<p align=left>"Thou trained in our temple some months ago?" he asked.</p>

<p align=left>"Ahh, of course," she replied, recognition dawning in her eyes. "You were the cute one!"</p>

<p align=left>Calvin blushed. "I am but an acolyte, new to the temple. It would surprise me greatly if thou actually remembered me."</p>

<p align=left>"What brings you here, so far from the temple?" Lexi wondered aloud.</p>

<p align=left>"I've been sent with a mission from my elders, to bring thee this message." Calvin quickly produced a scroll tube from his pouch, and presented it to Lexi. The tube was sealed with wax, and imprinted with the sigil of the master of the temple. Lexi opened it and read the contents.</p>

<p align=left>Hail Lady Lexi,<br>

I trust thou are well, as thou werest the last time we met. Hopefully thy studies progress well, and thou followest the True Path. The purpose of this missive is:<br>

The Elders of the temple will be passing through thy village in two months time and, if memory serves me, there is a small roadside shrine between here and there, dedicated to our God. From lack of use, this shrine is now a shambles, mostly overgrown with weeds and in sorry repair. The task has fallen to thee to see to its repair, to make it the haven it once was. To see the shrine in place, as it was originally, would bring a smile to the faces of the high priests of the Order. If this message has reached thee in time, thou shouldst have about 55 days to ready the place for our arrival. I trust thou wilt do thy best, as this matters greatly to me personally.<br><br>

Best Regards,<br>
Canon Temeril</p>

<p align=left>Lexi stood up suddenly. "A task. A task for my God." Lexi looked around to the others. "I have a most important matter to attend to. I could use your help. A shrine must be put in order. No telling what evil has been lurking there."</p>

<p align=left>"What's in it for us?" Quintor, the elven thief, piped in, as always, more interested in personal gain than anything else. "It's your god, not mine."</p>

<p align=left>"True enough, Quintor," Lexi sighed. "But have we not been through a lot together?"</p>

<p align=left>Brewman stood up and pressed his palms to the table. "I, for one, would be happy to find ANY kind of adventure again."</p>

<p align=left>Adolek chimed in. "I, of course, will follow you anywhere Lexi."</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, we've been trough a lot together, but rebuilding a temple sounds like work, not adventure," Quintor complained.</p>

<p align=left>"Hmm, are you not bored here?" Lexi asked, searching for a way to convince her longtime friend. "There may be adventure along the way, and treasure to be had. It matters not, for I go with, or without, you. I must prepare." Lexi left the tavern, probably off to the local suppliers to begin preparations.</p>

<p align=left>Calvin pulled another sheet of parchment from his pack, and sat down at a table, scribbling down some notes. He asked everyone's name and profession. Then he penned a map, from memory, with directions to the road-side shrine. Standing up, Calvin declared, "I must be away, to make sure no danger lurks on the roads ahead. Good luck on thy task, and the God's speed to its completion." With that, Calvin left the tavern, mounted his horse, and rode away down the street.</p>

<p align=left>Adolek turned to Brewman. "Can you believe we're going to wash a shrine?" Brew laughed. "They never talked about this in How to Be a Hero class!"</p>

<p align=left>"Better than hanging around this dump I guess," growled Brewman.</p>

<p align=left>The group retired to their rooms for the evening, eager to begin the day early in the morning. After a good night's rest, they all awoke bright-eyed, and ready to take to the road. Lexi was up ahead of them, and stood outside the tavern amidst a pile of buckets, sponges, a barrel of soap, and an armload of other tools. She grinned as everyone's jaws dropped. Motioning, she started splitting up the supplies, loading everyone down. Even the strongest of the party was barely able to take two steps before collapsing under the weight.</p>

<p align=left>Quintor, amazingly enough, escaped having anything loaded on him. He had conveniently had a "meeting" that he had to attend. Upon his return, he stood there, slowly shaking his head, and walked away again. Soon he returned with a sway-backed mule, and told everyone to load the supplies onto it.</p>

<p align=left>After a brief huddle, where they examined the map, the group set off down the trail to the North, where the shrine lay. The miles passed quickly under their feet, and around night-time they arrived at their destination.</p>

<p align=left>The shrine was tucked back off the road, in a small, overgrown glen. Trees surrounded it, with an open yard about twenty feet from the wall. The forest started at that point. A small path led up to the front door, which hung on one rusty hinge. The shrine was a two story building, made of stone, with several window holes cut in each level. It was small, probably only one room inside. Vines grew up the sides and moss covered the entire surface. Several nearby trees had fallen over, leaning precariously against the edge of the roof. From one of the window openings on the lower floor, the party saw a faint flickering of light of some type.</p>

<p align=left>Brewman nudged Lexi and pointed to the light. "Yes, I see," she nodded. "It might be someone praying. Let's go look." They walked cautiously up the path, trying not to make a lot of noise.</p>

<p align=left>From above, noise drew their attention. Looking up to the roof, the group could just see the heads and shoulders of two figures. The hiss of arrows made them spring into motion, all of them heading toward the open door of the shrine, which was the nearest cover.</p>

<p align=left>Lexi made the door first, and squawked in surprise as a rope strung across the entryway caught her just below the knees, sending her crashing to the floor inside the shrine. It was not a real floor, however, but a cleverly concealed pit. The false floor gave way, and Lexi fell, amidst a shower of rotten wood and straw. The air blew out of her lungs as she struck solid stone below.</p>

<p align=left>Brewman, who was closest behind Lexi, drew up short as he saw what had happened to the priestess. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the rest of the room. Across the floor, against the opposite wall, was an altar, or what used to be an altar. A figure knelt in front of it, motioning and chanting in a strange language. A couple lit candles cast his shadow about the room.</p>

<p align=left>Adolek bumped up against Brewman, almost shoving him into the pit. Looking down, he immediately dropped to the floor, lending an arm to a scrabbling Lexi. Brew looked at the two, growled, and jumped across the corner of the pit, stumbling as he did.</p>

<p align=left>Quintor, seeing the doorway was already full of his friends, decided to check out the rest of the building, and see if there was another way in. He quickly circled the structure, taking note of all possible means of ingress. Selecting a sturdy looking tree that had fallen against the shrine, he quickly scrambled up, peering over the flat rooftop to see if the archers were still there.</p>

<p align=left>Down inside, the praying figure stood to face the party. Lexi had climbed out of the pit, off to the right side, and grimaced as she heard footsteps slapping the floorboards above her head. She knew they would have company very soon. Their adversary, his face and neck hideously scarred and painted, began motioning with his arms and chanting in an arcane tongue. Several piles of bone, that were laying about the room, suddenly began moving, knitting themselves into human shape, and standing.</p>

<p align=left>Lexi groaned as the skeletons headed toward them. Looking out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Adolek drawing his holy symbol. Nodding her approval of his attempt to turn the evil creations, she drew her mace to deal with the spellcaster. Brewman did the same on the other side, thumbing the edge of his battle axe.</p>

<p align=left>The orcish shaman, for that's what it was, finished another set of gestures, and a green glow surrounded Adolek. The priest felt the intrusion of magic, and called upon his deity to overcome the evil spell. The green glow fell away, and Adolek breathed a sigh of relief. Calling upon his God yet again, Adolek commanded the skeletons to back away, but they only grinned and came on, rusted weapons clenched in bony fists. Two of them came after Lexi, while the other two advanced upon Brewman. To add to the danger, two orcs, bows clenced in their hands, crept down the steps in the corner, ready to fire upon the group.</p>

<p align=left>Lexi dodged and swung her mace, fending off the skeletons who sought her death. She took a club hit to the side, grunting with pain, but answered with a wicked mace shot of her own, crushing one of the skeleton's arms. Brewman held his own on the other side, blocking swipes with the haft of his axe, and forcing the skeletons back with his low, hard swings. Adolek, seeing his turning attempt had failed, decided to do something quite different. Summoning his courage, he yelled as he jumped across the pit and headed for the shaman. The archers pivoted to follow his movement, but all of the arrows fell behind him.</p>

<p align=left>****************</p>

<p align=left>Quintor quickly scrambled across the roof above, searching for a way down into the building. Spotting a hatch, he crept to it, listenen briefly, and threw it open, dodging back out of the way in case any orcs awaited within.</p>

<p align=left>****************</p>

<p align=left>Adolek knew he was in trouble when he drew up short before the orc shaman. The creature stood close to seven feet in height, and grinned maliciously at him as he stood his ground. Drawing a nasty-looking club from his belt, the shaman urged Adolek on to his doom, certain of the outcome.</p>

<p align=left>The next few moments passed in slow motion, or at least it seemed like it. The skeletons lunged toward Lexi, grappling with her, and throwing themselves into the pit, dragging her behind. As she was falling, she saw the orc archers loose their arrows. The arrows sped on their flight, transfixing Adolek where he stood. Brew saw his two opponents charge, and with a nasty swipe of his axe, shattered one of them into splinters. The shaman laughed at the hopeless look in Adolek's dying eyes, as the cleric sunk to the floor, an unspoken prayer dying on his lips.</p>

<p align=left>Lexi groaned as she landed on her shoulder in the pit for the second time. She just knew something was broken, but was determined not to let her friends die up above her. The skeletons had destroyed themselves on their ill-advised plunge into the pit, which left her free of foes for the moment. Scrambling up the edge, she crawled up on top of the floor, just in time to see Adolek fall, face forward, onto the hard, stone floor.</p>

<p align=left>*****************</p>

<p align=left>Quintor knew his luck held, as he descended into the upper story of the building and still hadn't seen the archers. He quickly located the stairway down, from all the noise that floated up through it. He heard the clash of battle and the screams of his comrades. Blocking all this out, he put his rogue skills to work, and crept silently as a shadow across the room to the stairway. Peering down, he saw the archers with their backs to him. Grinning, he drew his short bow, and placed several arrows on the floor beside him. This should be easy, he thought to himself.</p>

<p align=left>*****************</p>

<p align=left>Revenge blazed in Lexi's eyes. She headed for the shaman, gripping her mace in her good hand. Seeing Adolek laying there, however, indecision gripped her. She thought she saw the hint of breath filling his chest. She knew he was dying, and knew she was the only one that could save him.</p>

<p align=left>Dropping her mace to the floor, she knelt beside her fallen friend, and began chanting a spell to close his wounds. The shaman, puzzled at this action, nonetheless drew his club up over his head, sending it crashing down onto the back of the priestess' neck. She slumped to the floor, her neck broken beneath the savage blow.</p>

<p align=left>Brewman saw all hope for victory dashed when Lexi fell. Now, the rage filled his breast. Adrenalin drove him onward, and he blasted the skeleton in front of him to the floor, and motioned the shaman to come and dance.</p>

<p align=left>The orc archers were taken by surprise, as arrows suddenly stung them from above and behind. Quintor fired quickly, not allowing them a chance to charge him. The best they could do was turn and return his fire, even though he stood mostly covered by the angle of the stair. Their arrows missed him badly, while his found openings in their shabby armor, plunging deep into filthy bodies.</p>

<p align=left>Brewman and the shaman traded vicious blows for several minutes while Quintor dealt with the archers. Both combatants were hurt badly, but while Brew was already tired from dealing with the skeletons, the shaman had only swung his weapon once, and was still fresh. As Brew's movements slowed, the orc came on harder, striking clanging blows off Brew's weapon. It was only a matter of time before one of these blows slipped through....</p>

<p align=left>Brew knew he was overmatched. Fatigue was draining him too fast. He tried a last desperate measure, rolling forward at the shaman's legs, bringing his axe in a low sweep. The shaman hopped aside, Brew lost sight of him for just a split second, and the world went dark as an orcish club robbed him of consciousness.</p>

<p align=left>Quintor had just dropped the second orc archer when his last friend fell. The shaman drew a huge breath, and turned his eye upon Quintor. The elf quickly counted his arrows....six left. He kissed one, nocked it, and let it fly. A quick mace knocked the missile aside. The shaman walked on, approaching the foot of the stairs, a sadistic smile on his face. Quintor knew he would have only one more shot before the shaman beat him into a bloody pile of flesh. At point-blank range, he let it fly.</p>

<p align=left>The shaman shrieked as the arrowed pierced its eye, and tumbled back down the steps to lay still on the floor. Quintor let his fear subside, and surveyed the situation. His friends lay beaten upon the floor. He was the only one left standing. He mourned for a few seconds, and then set about to his tasks. He quickly stripped the orcs of all valuables, and then did the same for his comrades. Upon reaching Brewman, he saw that the fighter was not dead, but had been knocked unconscious by the careless shaman. Quintor propped Brew's head up on a pack, and finished his work.</p>

<p align=left>***************</p>

<p align=left>Brewman awoke later that evening to a splitting headache. Quintor replayed the battle for him, and Brew mourned the loss of two good comrades. Quintor decided that the objective was failed, and they should cut their losses and head back to town.</p>

<p align=left>The next morning, the bodies were buried out behind the shrine. The survivors held a brief service before setting out on the road. They arrived at Karl's Tavern that evening, and explained what had happened to Lexi and Adolek. They retired to their beds, wondering what their future held.</p>

<p align=left>***************</p>

<p align=left>The entourage of priests happened upon the site several weeks after the battle. Canon Temeril was immediately worried when he saw that the shrine had not been restored. He sent one of his minor priests to cast an augury, to determine what had happened. When the priest finished, he returned with his report of the battle, and the lost lives.</p>

<p align=left>A tear fell from Temeril's eye. He had held great hope for this young priestess. If only the shrine had been set right, his God may have seen fit to restore life to the fallen.</p>

<p align=left>Temeril was interrupted in his reverie by a young priest. "Canon, we'll not have need of these magical weapons after all?"</p>

<p align=left>"Nay, my son, those to whom they were to be gifted will be long gone by now. Put them back into storage, and we'll take them back to the temple when we return."</p>

<p align=left>The young priest nodded his understanding, and placed the gleaming weapons into a chest inside the wagon.</p>

<p align=left>And the group of priests continued on their pilgrimage.</p>
