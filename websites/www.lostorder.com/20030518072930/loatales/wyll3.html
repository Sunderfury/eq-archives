<p align=left><b>Journal - Day Three</b><br><i>by Wyll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>"Ugh". If I could write a sound that would describe how I felt this morning, that's what it would be. Sleeping in the dockhouse in Butcherblock is not my idea of comfort. I have traveled the world, and though I have generally gotten over the inborn need to sleep under the mountains, I still feel that some things just aren't right...and wooden houses suspended over water is not right!</p>

<p align=left>So I woke up groggily this morning to once again find most of my brothers out already. It seems the magic users of the family have need to take long walks early in the morning, perhaps they need to meditate or something, but I can pretty comfortably say that warriors the world over will sleep in till the last possible moment. Wyloon, Wysll and Wyndelle soon returned from their morning "constitutional" and we got to talking. Apparently Wyxle had run off, probably to relieve the dwarves of Kaladim of a few of their more valuable possessions. I don't know how that rogue can do something like this just when we set out to search for our father. Ah well, I suppose his priorities are different than ours. Later, as my brothers and I were waiting around for a boat to arrive, I receive another message that said our long lost (so we assumed) brother Wenceslaus would be joining us! Oh happy day! I hadn't seen Wenc in years...but obviously, his practice of the necromantic arts keeps him out of the more populated areas. Around noon we all gathered on the docks awaiting the ship when I hear a voice, apparently Wenc has arrived and is standing right near the party invisible! It seems he has learned some new tricks...</p>

<p align=left>And once again, that infernal boat ride! Not much to write about there, I hate the things! Without fail, I get sick everytime, barely able to stand on me own two legs, using the bar and a short beer for support...hmmm...I hope no one ever reads this... Oh, and we also spent a good deal of time bringing Wenc up to speed on what had happened the last two days. If I could have seen him clearly, I'm sure he would have looked very interested.</p>

<p align=left>We arrived in Freeport later that afternoon without much idea of where to go. After being bound by a fellow gnome we decided to follow Wysll's suggestion of checking up on the wizard's guild. After all, father had spent time in the wizard's guild of Felwithe, it would seem reasonable he would go to the guild in Freeport as well. First off, I want to know how these wizards make their great stone towers float like that! I'm not sure I would be the first in line to live in a floating mountain, but it certainly would be something to show off! As exciting as that was, we couldn't find anyone in the wizard's guild willing to help out. They were all too busy making magic sparklies to take the effort to look at the gnomes at their feet. Bah! I say...</p>

<p align=left>I suggested next that we maybe talk to the city guards, it would make sense that they keep track of those who come in and out of the city...though, since this was likely over a hundred years ago, I question whether records would be all that helpful. Upon arriving at the city gates a rather shady looking halfing actually assaulted me! Can you believe it? The little rogue thought he could snatch my purse and get away with it! I managed to corner him by a cart and question him. I have no idea what he was thinking and the little wretch just stood there quivering like a terrified dog. He was so worried about us not telling the thieves guild about his incredible stupidity. During the conversation (if you can call it that) the little bastard blurted something that really caught my attention, he said that he often picks from the gnomes in Rivervale...well well well...so gnomes DO live in Rivervale! It was around that time the bastard ran off, but I didn't feel like chasing him down any more.</p>

<p align=left>The party agreed that Rivervale should be our next destination, but before we set out we really should find some escorts, the deserts and forests were no place to travel unprotected. We stopped into a dirty little tavern I remembered from my past visits through Freeport, the Hogcaller's Inn. By Brell we are a lucky group, inside we found both Waran and Warelor of the Order! Though they were quite intoxicated from an afternoon of heavy "celebrating" (Waran's impending wedding, I assume), they thought it would be fun to see us to Rivervale. shortly after that we departed for city of the fuzzy people.</p>

<p align=left>The trip was long and relatively uneventful...well, except for the time when Wyloon thought it would be fun to ge the interest of a hill giant...one day I'm going to knock that fool senseless...if he isn't already. I don't know what he was thinking, that cursed giant paralleled the party all the way to Kithicor, where it got bored and gave up chase when Wyloon went through the pass. We patiently waited for the giant to move and then as smoothly as we could, ducked into the pass to meet up with our brothers.</p>

<p align=left>The walk through Kithicor was uneventful, thankfully, and we arrived in Rivervale late that evening. I was already quite excited to think we might find more information about father. I don't really expect to find him alive, but at least some help telling us that he was here, maybe that he left some things for us...I guess I'm not sure what I want...but I am excited. We walked into the city proper thinking it good that we find a room for the night before we go looking for father. And then Wenceslaus ran into a bit of trouble...in fact, he got dead. Thankfully his skill in necromancy kept his body pretty much intact, but he was still transported back to Freeport, which put him long out of range of us. Without any other options we decided to bed down for the night. And wouldn't you know it! The inn was a wooden house suspended above water! I do believe Brell is laughing himself to sleep on this night.</p>

<p align=left>Tomorrow we search for father, tonight, I hope my dreams are more pleasant.</p>
