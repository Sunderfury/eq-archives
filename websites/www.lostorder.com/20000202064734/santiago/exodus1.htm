</font><font SIZE="2">

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis
sat alone in the antechamber, listening to the ticking of the clock. Twilight had come and
gone, and the only light to be had now was from a small candle on the table. Try as it
might, the tiny flame could not dispel the shadows. It could hold them back for a while,
but in the end the darkness would win. It was inevitable.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">In front of the
candle sat a closed spellbook. Scrawled upon the pages of that tome were all of the spells
that Sarangoulis had ever learned &#150; the sum of his magical knowledge. He had spent
years traveling the world, searching for bits of lore to fill those pages. He placed his
hand gently upon the red leather cover, his fingers tracing the contours of the ornate
brass corners. But he did not open the book. He would never again open it.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Outside, he heard the
gallop of hooves as a knight rode through the street below. Somewhere nearby, a bard was
playing a song on his harp. The lilting melody carried faintly through the air, like a
ghostly echo. Sarangoulis closed his eyes and listened to the sounds of Britain, the
sounds of what had been, until now, his home.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Then there came the
sound of footsteps. The door opened, and a young apprentice entered.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;They&#146;re
ready for you,&quot; said Castaldi, his eyes downcast.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I can tell from
your expression what they have decided,&quot; said Sarangoulis.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I&#133;I&#146;m
sorry, sir,&quot; said Castaldi.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Why should you
be?&quot; asked the wizard. &quot;This is not your fault, nor theirs, nor mine. It is
simply the way things are. Do you believe in fate, Castaldi?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The youth shrugged.
&quot;I don&#146;t know. I guess so. But I don&#146;t always like what fate decides.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis smiled.
&quot;Fate can often be cruel, it&#146;s true&quot; he said. &quot;But not always.
Sometimes, what seems to be an end can turn out to be a new beginning.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Castaldi said
nothing.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Come,&quot;
said Sarangoulis. &quot;Fate beckons&#133;we mustn&#146;t keep her waiting.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The two of them left
the room, leaving behind a closed book and a tiny, flickering candle.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><img src="Bar_top.jpg" alt="Bar_top.jpg (7979 bytes)" WIDTH="504" HEIGHT="14"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">In truth, Sarangoulis
had known what the council would decide before he even set foot in the Tower of High
Sorcery. He had been expecting this for some time now &#150; it had only been a question
of when.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">His suspicions were
confirmed as he entered the council chambers and looked upon the faces of the other
wizards. Sarangoulis could read the thoughts written upon those faces, as clear as any
words on a parchment. Anger, mostly &#150; for he had dared to trespass upon forbidden
ground. But hidden just beneath the surface of that anger, he could sense fear. They
considered him dangerous, now. He had become a threat &#150; not to them, but to their
Circle. Many of the younger members were impressionable and curious, and the elders feared
that they might be enticed by talk of other worlds. The result would be a division in
their ranks that might signal the end of their carefully constructed hierarchy. This could
not be allowed to happen. Therefore, Sarangoulis had to be eliminated.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Sarangoulis,&quot;
said the grand wizard Ravindranath. &quot;It has been brought to the attention of this
Council that you have recently sought to unlock the secret of travel to Norrath. Is this
true?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It is
true.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;The pursuit of
such knowledge is strictly forbidden,&quot; said Ravindranath. &quot;Are you aware of the
penalties for such transgressions?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I am.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Is there
anything you wish to say to this Council in your defense?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis stepped
forward. &quot;Honored council members, I appear to you as a criminal for having violated
one of your laws. I do not deny my own actions. I knew the path that I was walking, and I
knew where it would lead. But I want to explain to you why I chose to follow it.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It is said that
in ancient times, magic was feared. Most people did not understand it, nor did they want
to. Those who pursued such knowledge were persecuted and put to death.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Today, magic is
commonplace. It is used to heal the wounded and feed the hungry. It is used to travel
great distances in the blink of an eye. It is also used to wound and damage, and to summon
beings of terrible destructive power.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Were the
ancients right? Would our world be a better place without magic? We will never know. As
beings of intellect and curiosity, we are irresistibly compelled to learn more, to know
more. If the pursuit of knowledge is a crime, then I am certainly guilty of it.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It is not the
pursuit of knowledge that we condemn,&quot; said Ravindranath, &quot;but rather the study
of certain subjects. These subjects are forbidden for a reason.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Just as
necromancy has been forbidden,&quot; said Sarangoulis,&quot; yet I know for a fact that
many of you practice it.&quot; Several council members looked away. &quot;And why do you
practice it? Because you hunger, as I do, for something new. The old ways have grown
stale. We mindlessly cast spells over and over, day after day, in order to improve our
skill. We toil endlessly in order to make enough money to afford our precious reagents.
And to what end? I am sick of magic, as we know it.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;When I first
heard the legends of Norrath, I was ecstatic. The very thought that there might be worlds
beyond this one was enough to rekindle my hope. So I embarked upon a dark journey. I
perused forbidden tomes and oracles to learn everything I could. Yes, I knew that I was
violating edicts of this Council. But what was the alternative? To stay forever in this
forsaken land, which has become a prison to me, barren and desolate.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Honored council
members, you know me. You know that my heart is devoid of iniquity. I do not seek to
become a prophet, leading thousands of people to some &#145;paradise&#146; that may not
even exist. I simply search for something new, something to revive the wonder that this
world used to hold for me.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That is all I
wanted to say,&quot; he said. &quot;I humbly await the decision of this Council.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The council chamber
was silent for a moment as the other mages contemplated his words.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Sarangoulis,&quot;
said Ravindranath, &quot;this Circle was founded more than a century ago. Since its
inception, our purpose has been not only the study of arcane lore, but also the defense of
this realm against all manner of threats. Whether it truly exists, or whether it is simply
a myth, we consider the realm of Norrath to be one of those threats. Already there are
hundreds, if not thousands of people who believe that the legends are true. Farmers,
nobles, healers, merchants&#133;all of them have quit their jobs and gone out in search of
this mythical realm. As a result, our society has begun to collapse. Unharvested crops
wither in the fields, abandoned buildings have begun to decay, and foul creatures now roam
the wilds, unhindered by the warriors who used to oppose them. This must not continue.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;In these
trouble times, the people look to people such as us for guidance. We set an example for
them. If our members were to set out, as you have, in search of some &#145;holy
grail&#146;, then matters would be even worse.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We understand
your reasons for your actions. Indeed, we sympathize. You are young. You seek to explore
new lands and unravel new mysteries. But you must understand that we cannot allow members
of our Circle to study forbidden lore. Therefore, it is the judgment of this council that
you shall no longer bear the title of Wizard, nor shall you be permitted to practice
magic. While this may appear to be a harsh judgment, the law would have demanded a more
terrible price to be paid.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis bowed.
&quot;I accept the judgment of this Council.&quot; Sarangoulis turned and left the chamber
without another word. For what more was there to say?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He descended the
stone steps and walked through the main hall, where several lesser mages were purchasing
precious reagents from vendors. Sarangoulis quietly walked past all of them until he stood
upon the ornate stone bridge that connected the Guild with the rest of the city. Here he
paused for a moment to take in his surroundings. It had been a long time since he had
crossed this bridge; in the past, he had simply used his magic to teleport him from place
to place. Now he would have to rely upon his own two feet.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The night air was
warm, foreshadowing the death of winter and the return of spring. The lampposts had been
lit, and Britain was a city of flickering shadows and unfriendly faces. Sarangoulis took a
deep breath and crossed the bridge into the dark city, a wizard no more.</font></font></p>
