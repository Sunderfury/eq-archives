<p align=left><b>A History, Part III</b><br><i>by Anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The outer reaches of Vesper’s territory were often a dread place to travel; few dared leave the protection of the town guardsmen. The scent of death oft filled the air of these most dark and treacherous woods. However on this night, even the raindrops could not stifle the sounds of merriment and felicity. </p>

<p align=left>A great bonfire roared in a tiny clearing while the youth of Vesper’s lesser half danced about in pure bliss. Several great harts turned slowly on spits as their aromas filled the nearby areas. Incredible tales of adventure, gaudy jokes, and a constant feeling of joviality lasted deep into the night.</p>

<p align=left>The smell of roasted meat wafted past Matrick as he marched forward into the woods. He had cast off his soaked tunic and guard issue halberd soon after he departed his post and was busy contemplating what he was going to say had happened. Surely the captain would want an explanation of why he did not return. Unfortunately, this would have to wait as an overpowering hunger wretched the powers of thought from him. He made his way towards a clearing, hoping he would be lucky enough to partake in the feast emitting the scent that had accosted him.</p>

<p align=left>Matrick’s presence immediately caught the attention of the older members of the celebration; after all, it was not often a man in armor passed through this area. They approached him quickly, so as to discern his intent. “Hello sir,” a tall and overbearing man said. “How may we be of service to you on this night?” His eyes set fixed upon the sword dangling from Matrick’s hilt.</p>

<p align=left>“Greetings,” Matrick responded with an eager smile, “I was merely hoping to join in this most joyous of celebrations. I have traveled most of the night without food, and my stomach now roars and aches in want.” </p>

<p align=left>“’Tis well you should join us. Though I must ask ye leave your sword here by this tent. There are many children about, and I would hate to see an accident occur.” This was a concern, but more on the man’s mind was the question mark hovering over the outsider’s head. Who was he and why was he armed? </p>

<p align=left>Matrick thought for a moment. His sword was part of him, an extension of his body. However, any ideas of holding on to it were vanquished by the stern look on the tall man’s face in combination with the opinions of his own stomach. “Surely. My name is Matrick, I hail from Vesper.”</p>

<p align=left>His fears assuaged a bit the man introduced himself. “Calvar is my name. Enjoy yourself whilst you stay.” Calvar studied the man’s face and could find no trace of ill intent.</p>

<p align=left>After a hearty meal and many boisterous conversations, Matrick seemed at ease. His mind reflected on what he had left behind. A stodgy little house within the city walls, a mediocre wage, boring job, nothing he had really mattered. Everything was different out here. The smell of the air, the freedom, everything seemed fresh and alive; exactly the opposite of what he considered his life. He had never married—his work was his life. He had received the highest commendations and praises from the magistrate of Vesper, yet this all seemed highly irrelevant now. </p>

<p align=left>Lost in the peacefulness of this woodland environ, Matrick had reinvented himself. He vowed to start anew. Tomorrow he would resign as a guard of the realm and move his worldly possessions out of the town. It was indeed a big change, but one he approached with the avidity of obsession.</p>

<p align=left>The crack of branches and yelling of men roused the clearing from its dreamlike state. The hard pounding of hooves on wet ground was drawing near.</p>
