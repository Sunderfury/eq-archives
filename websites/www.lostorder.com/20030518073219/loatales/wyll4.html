<p align=left><b>Journal - Day Four</b><br><i>by Wyll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I awoke this morning quite anxious. We've followed where this prophecy has taken us, and each step seems to reveal something new about our family. Today we set out in search of our father, Wynston.</p>

<p align=left>Admittedly, I didn't expect to find anything but a hint from the mayor that he had once been in Rivervale or maybe an entry in a log book somewhere in a library, but in truth, it was much more than that! In a small halfling hut outside Rivervale in the Misty Thicket, we actually found our father!</p>

<p align=left>Wynston was older, naturally, and somehow sadder. Of course, my memories are from so long ago that I can barely remember what he was like, but there is a feeling you get from someone and you know things are just...different. When I showed him the scrap of parchment with the prophecy on it, he didn't find anything real identifiable, except for a line that he said was familiar...familiar because it could be speaking of our mother. I hadn't heard of our mother Daillia since about the time our father left us, now I know why.</p>

<p align=left>It seems our mother was a daughter of the Darkmor family, a dark and evil family, a plague on the good gnomes of Ak'anon. However, unlike the rest of her family, she was born in balance, equally good and evil. Apparently our uncle Wyndsor fell in love with Daillia but was unable to bring her fully into the Light. However, Wynston did bring her into the Light and soon after married her. The effect on our uncle was crushing. Father says he retreated into himself, became cold and detached and dedicated his life completely to the worship of Brell. And then, tragedy struck our family. Daillia was murdered. Father, knowing he would be suspect, fled Ak'anon, but before leaving, he left our care to his brother Wyndsor. Though obviously saddened, father said uncle was almost...releived to hear of Daillia's death.</p>

<p align=left>I'm still a bit stunned by all of this news at once, and there are still a number of things that I don't quite understand. For example, why would uncle tell us our father was dead? I suppose he couldn't have known for sure, but it was still a lie, and I can't think uncle would lie without good reason. And there's there's the question of whether Wyndsor had anything to do with our mother's murder...some things I really don't want to think about, at least not right now.</p>

<p align=left>Before leaving father, he gave each of us a magic flask of water and had us drink it all down. He then spoke to me...in my head! It was as if he could talk to us no matter where we were! Quite a gift!</p>

<p align=left>Leaving father was very painful, but we knew we still had quite a journey ahead of us. Our next destination, Ak'anon to speak with our uncle Wyndsor once again. Thankfully, Timbo the druid was in Misty and offered to transport our whole group back to Feydwer! I would happily endure the uncomfortable effects of magic to avoid the boat ride across the Ocean of Tears. In a blink we appeared in a druid circle in Butcherblock, and there we camped for the night, beneath the protection of ancient stones.</p>
