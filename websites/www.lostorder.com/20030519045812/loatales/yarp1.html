<blockquote>
<p align=left>As the fog lifted from his mind Yarp found himself in the clearing of the LOA, transported instantly by three little words and a few plants. Though he despised travelling this way, it's convenience could not be debated. Tara stood beside him as he stepped forward, as though she had been expecting him.</p>

<p align=left>"Yarp, I was expecting you." Well, that answered that question. "How did the Mass go?" </p>

<p align=left>"Well enough, Admiral. And thank you for your directions." he answered without pause.</p>

<p align=left>Tara stood looking at him, with a quizzical look on her face, half amusement and half curiosity. "What did you think of the Tower?"</p>

<p align=left>Yarp chuckled softly as he sat by the fountain. "The Order of the Ebon Skull leave nothing to the imagination, do they?" he remarked. </p>

<p align=left>"Even if I had not the use of your rune, I trust I would have been able to follow the scent of death to their very door."</p>

<p align=left>Tara continued to stare at him, waiting. "I suppose you want to know what I thought of the ceremony." Yarp sighed, the exhaustion apparent in his face.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, I do" she said simply. "You heeded my warning?" she asked, with genuine concern in her voice for the first time that evening.</p>

<p align=left>"Yes, m'lady. Either they did not consider me a worthy enough adversary to baptize me by fire or I was to quick for them, and they failed to catch me off guard. I prefer to believe the latter, though I suspect the former."</p>

<p align=left>"And your meeting?"</p>

<p align=left>"Did not happen." he spat out with contempt in his voice. "He did not show, the scoundrel. Geist made the appropriate apologies and excuses, but my doubt in their abilities seems to have been well grounded. I believe them to be playing me for a fool"</p>

<p align=left>Tara nodded, as she looked away, seemingly preoccupied. Seeing as how he no longer had her attention, Yarp shrugged and turned to go. As he did, he felt a twinge in his abdomen, followed moments later by a gut-wrenching twisting. Yarp stopped abruptly and inhaled sharply as he fought the urge to double over. "Rassefrackin'" he thought to himself with alarm "....no, not now." Can't...let anyone see me like this..." Yarp gasped for breath and turned his head slightly, seeing Tara out of the corner of his eye. She was talking to him, but all he could hear was the ringing and howling of the bloodlust in his ears as his body cried out with hunger. He made out one word that she said...hunt...</p>

<p align=left>Yarp grunted with effort as he struggled to fight the feeling. He drew his bow and spoke with pointed effort. "Tara, yes, let us hunt..."</p>

<p align=left>She turned to him, and he thought he saw a frown cross her face as she looked him over. Yarp put on his helm with a clunk, so as to hide the pain that crossed his face. "Maybe hunting will help me combat this cursed feeling." he thought to himself. </p>

<p align=left>Tara continued to chatter as they strolled through the woods of Yew. Every step was a laborious process to Yarp, every motion an uphill battle. When they stumbled upon the occasional rogue orc or troll, Yarp let his arrows fly, grateful to be doing something that distracted him. But the feeling was getting worse and worse and he realized that it was only a matter of time before his basest instincts took over and he would be forced to feed. Yarp looked up suddenly and noticed two things. Tara had wandered out of sight, and a wandering healer was approaching him with a smile on his face and his hands outstretched in a peaceful manner.</p>

<p align=left>A crack that was surely audible to the whole forest resonated within Yarp's skull as his willing consciousness lost the battle against the ravages of the bloodlust. He flung himself on the unsuspecting healer, watching with joy the look of terror that suddenly crossed the poor man's face. The man raised his hands to ward off the evil, but his was a lost cause. Yarp knocked his hands away with a single blow and buried his fingers in the man's neck, tearing out his windpipe with a single motion. The man continued to struggle wordlessly as Yarp pinned him down and drank from the crimson fountain that was spurting from his throat. As the flood of life-essence subsided, so did the man's twitching. Yarp grabbed the man's head by his chin and violently separated his head from his shoulders. Tucking his prize into his pack, Yarp heard a noise. Whirling about, he saw Tara putting the finishing blow to another healer who had come to try to rescue her comrade.</p>

<p align=left>Yarp stared, unblinking, with the intensity of a crouched lion, poised to strike at his wounded prey. Tara knew full well that he was there, as she motioned to him. "Come..." she said softly. "Feed."</p>

<p align=left>Without a second thought Yarp lept to the carcass of the freshly dead healer, feeling the warmth that still rose from her body. As Yarp fed a second time, he felt his senses returning to him. </p>

<p align=left>He turned and silently faced Tara, who looked back at him. He saw no judgement in her eyes. His cheeks flushed with colour as a furious sense of shame swept over him like a tsiunami. They stared at each other as minutes passed, neither one breaking away and neither one saying a word. Yarp flinched first as the madness disappeared and the full realization of what he had done sunk in. He had taken a human life, had fed on Homo Sapian blood. He had done what he had sworn never to do again....and he had done it in front of the Admiral of the Lost Order of Akalabeth.</p>

<p align=left>Suddenly, frantically, Yarp started shaking. Uncontrollable tremors overtook his body as he looked down to see the blood still dripping from his cloak. He started brushing at his clothing and armour, trying without success to remove the red stains. Tara approached him slowly, but as she approached he retreated. He started tearing at his clothing, removing his armour and letting it drop to the forest floor with a thud. He tore off his tunic, his boots, his gloves, his kilt, until he stood naked before Tara, naked except for his muddy and stained cloak. As the cloak whipped around his shoulders in the cold wind, he saw that she was talking to him, saying words, explaining something. What was she saying? Why can't I hear her? </p>

<p align=left>Yarp gazed around at the forest with sudden clarity. He saw Tara moving towards him, motioning at him, smiling at him. He heard his own voice, as though he was listening through someone else's' ears. His voice sounded tired and used and somehow strange. Those three little words that had always removed him from trouble...</p>
