<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk
was miserable.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">From the moment he
entered the dwarven city, and saw that most of the buildings were shorter than he was, he
knew he was in for trouble. When he followed Bierfreund into an armor shop, he hit his
head on the top of the doorway and nearly passed out. Everywhere he went, shopkeepers eyed
him with suspicion, children pointed and laughed at him, and the guards followed him with
drawn weapons. He really felt like an outsider.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Then, as if he
wasn&#146;t uncomfortable enough already, he had to follow Bierfreund as he swam through
an underground river. The dwarf explained that this was the secret passage to the hall of
the dwarven king. Greyhawk thought it odd that anyone who wished to visit the king had to
swim through a river &#150; but then again, the dwarves were an odd bunch, all in all.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"><img src="http://www.gamecore.net/everquest/screenshots/santi_end9_palace.jpg" width="493" height="425" alt="santi_end9_palace.jpg (50847 bytes)"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">So now he paced back
and forth in a marble antechamber, careful not to bump his head against the ceiling.
Bierfreund sat calmly on top of the oak table, with the patience of a statue.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Why can&#146;t
we see the king now?&quot; asked Greyhawk.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;He will send
for us when he is ready,&quot; replied the dwarf.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;When will that
be?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;As soon as he
is ready,&quot; said the dwarf.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You said that
already. Will it be minutes or hours?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund shrugged.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You dwarves
don&#146;t talk very much, do you?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We don&#146;t
flap our gums all the time, if that&#146;s what ye mean. When there&#146;s something that
needs to be said, we say it.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk scowled at
his wet clothing. He was dripping onto the carpet. &quot;I suppose I won&#146;t be able to
find any dry clothes around here that will fit me.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund shook his
head.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Does everyone
have to swim through that river to get here?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund shook his
head.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk stopped and
stared at the dwarf. &quot;You mean, there&#146;s another way in?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund nodded.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Then why in the
name of Innoruuk did you make me swim here?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You smelled
bad,&quot; said the dwarf.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Before Greyhawk could
even think about swinging his hammer at the little dwarf, the door opened, and the
king&#146;s herald nodded toward them.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;The king will
see us now,&quot; said Bierfreund.</font></font></p>
