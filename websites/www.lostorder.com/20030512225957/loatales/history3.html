<p align=left><b>A History, Part I</b><br><i>by Anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A light summer rain fell throughout the northern woods of Vesper. It was the weekend of the Great Festival and the privileged had congregated within the city of Vesper to celebrate. Those less fortunate had accustomed themselves to a less elaborate celebration held in the outskirts of the town. The rain was not falling heavily enough to cause problems for the poorer class and was in fact a refreshing contrast to the uncommonly hot day.</p>

<p align=left>Society’s elite found the rain less appealing to their tastes however. Most of this year’s celebration was to be held indoors. It was a gala event highlighted by a feast fit for the court of Lord British followed by hours of socializing and dancing. The evening progressed quickly and as night fell, the brilliant shimmer of candle lights and torches poured forth onto the streets, filling the other wise deserted town with an eerie glow. </p>

<p align=left>A lone guard sat perched upon a rock at the northern entrance to the city, driving the end of his pole arm into the earth. A small brown puddle had filled the hole he had created and helped to take his mind of where he was and what he was doing.</p>

<p align=left>“Hail!” a voiced called from across the bridge. Heavy steps made their way toward the stationary guardsman.</p>

<p align=left>The stooped guard sprung to his feet and responded in kind. “Greetings, M’lord,” he proudly said as he wrung his now drenched tunic. “’Twould be our luck to have duty on such a night. Even the poor are out celebrating and yet we are stuck protecting the city!” he raised his voice in a cynical matter. Matrick Beylor had been in the service of Vesper for fifteen long and tedious years. He had arrested and dealt with some of the worst trash of Britannia. It seemed cruel to him that he, the senior most guard, should be out during the Great Festival. “Aye,” responded the weary and soaked guard, “seems fortune is against us.” “Ah, Jinsin. I fear I did not recognize you.” Matrick relaxed as he realized who the man was. Jinsin was a youthful and optimistic man. This month marked the conclusion of his first year as a guard. Matrick knew full well that all the newer recruits were given duty during celebrations, but he did not buy the “we need someone with experience” line that his commanding officer had given him a week ago.</p>

<p align=left>“How fares the eve with you, M’lord?” Jinsin asked.</p>

<p align=left>“’Tis well, ‘tis well,” Matrick trailed off. Given the chance, Matrick would just as soon avoid pleasantries and resume drilling the butt of his weapon into the ground. He turned his head back to the spot where he had been sitting and sighed as he noticed his night’s work collapsed by the rain. “Halt!” Matrick suddenly shouted, “did you hear it Jinsin? Sounded like footsteps amidst the brush.” Matrick readied his halberd and anxiously paced around.</p>

<p align=left>“Nay sir, I heard nothing,” Jinsin replied. “Perhaps ‘twas the wind.”</p>

<p align=left>“No. I am certain it was something else. Hold here, I shall investigate.” Before Jinsin could object, Matrick was already lost among the shadows of the forest.</p>
