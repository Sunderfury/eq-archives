<p align=left><b>A Pirate Retires</b><br><i>by Keeshi</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The midday sun beat heavily upon the sailor and his first mate, scorching their skin yet lightening their spirits. The Dark Justicar broke the waves smoothly giving its passengers a pleasant sail indeed. The captain looked about and seemed lost in thought. "Somethin amiss cap'n?" The first mate asked whole-heartedly. "Ye don't sense none of them thar sea serpents or nothin do ye?" The mate's voiced cracked just a bit with fear.</p>

<p align=left>"Nay Pete, I'm jest thinkin about things. Ye know we've sailed these seas a long time mate, longer then most in fact." Keeshi turned and looked his one-eye'ld tillerman. "I'm thinkin our sailin days are over mate. Ye've done me a great service these many years, but I know yer 'earts wish. I've 'eard ye speakin in the tavern's about 'ow one day ye'ld like to 'ave yer own, whar ye could spend yer life tellin tales and servin ale. I think now's the time fer ye to fullfill that dream." Smiling sadly Keeshi turned back to look at the sea.</p>

<p align=left>"But cap'n ye aint done sailin! As long as yer on the 'igh seas so be I!" Pete replied in earnest. "'sides what do I know about runnin a tavern? I can't even add two plus two. 'ow would I charge blokes?" Pete's voice was now filled with sorrow and discomfort. "Did I do somethin wrong? I can fix it!"</p>

<p align=left>"Nay lad, ye've done great by me. I could nary 'ave asked fer a better first mate. Truth of the matter is this mate. Over the years ye've collected a lot of the shinnies. Ye don't need to go chargin no blokes fer thar ale. What I'm sayin is this. The Lost Order 'as itself a tavern in need of a barkeep. Why don't ye take them coins ye've been 'ordin, but a large amount of ale, and use it to keep the patrons of the tavern 'appy?" Keeshi stated flatly, not truly wishing to see his mate leave yet knowing the time had come.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye cap'n I reckon I could do that." Pete replied. "Though I aint none too sure I'll be 'appy on dry land. I can't truly remember the last time I spent more then a week off the 'igh seas." The first mate looked once more to his captain. "Will ye be stoppin by mate? I would 'ate to think that this be the last time I see ye. After all ye've saved me 'ide on more then a few occasions."</p>

<p align=left>"Ar! Yer gonna 'ave to of me favorite things thar mate! Ale and wenches! Whar ever ye find those things together, ye'll find me." Keeshi's voice took on the sound of joy. "I'm sure ye'll be one 'ell of a barkeep mate. Do me proud like ye've done these past many years! Now lay course fer Yew matey! Ye 'ave a tavern to attend to!"</p>

<p align=left>"Ar! Changin course now cap'n!" Pete uttered his last confirmation of an order and spun the wheel hard. The ship turned easily, and headed towards the woodland town of Yew.</p>
