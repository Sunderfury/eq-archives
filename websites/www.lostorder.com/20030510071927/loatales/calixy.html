<p align=left><b>A Note</b><br><i>by Calixy</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Drachiero,</p>

<p align=left>Would have joined you if I could. The warriors of my family have been watching me. *glances around nervously* Ever since the guards brought me home, battered and bloody claiming I fell, I am not allowed freedom without prying eyes upon me. Those guards beat me, knowing me for what I am. Luckily to hide their own duplicity they failed to disclose mine.</p>

<p align=left>I have managed a bit of experience but not much. And I did swindle a fellow out of a whole plat! For five measly scraps of bone. Ah the gullible. Twas after that when the guards chanced upon me. But I kept my plat! Hid it right away and search as they might they could not find it.</p>

<p align=left>I shall sneak out when you next wish to meet. Name the time here as I have seen conflicting notes passed about. </p>

<p align=left>Seek the shadows friend, for you shall find me there.</p>

<p align=left>*slips away, into the darkness*</p>
<p align=left>Calixy</p>
