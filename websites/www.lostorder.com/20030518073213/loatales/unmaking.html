<p align=left><b>The Unmaking of the Unmaking</b><br><i>by Grynn</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The powers of Darkness revile humanity, and for many reasons. Humanity, in all it's glorious omniformity holds a unique power, a gift, if ye will. Ours is a path of choices, choices the undead do not have, and would certainly like to take from ye, friend. </p>

<p align=left>There is much boastful talk bandied about within the fortresses and temples of the Dark Ones. All around the idea of eternal undeath. They stand upon this as an example of their superiority to humanity. But we know different, dont we friend...</p>

<p align=left>Humanity is not as much about the individual as it is about the collective spirit to which we contribute. Many a man and woman have lamented the short span of our time here in this realm, and rightly so. The loss of loved ones is a heavy weight to bare. But in the end, it is the fear of our own death that scares us, no? The forces of evil would have ye believe that their path promises an eternity, that their path saves ye from the cycles of life. A most tempting offer.</p>

<p align=left>Until you examine it of course. First, the obvious: Would ye wish to travel the world in the husk of a mortal? Do ye desire to live as an immitation of the living? Do not be fooled by the Dark One's proclamations of superiority. They are but a desperate immitation of humanity, a collection of bruised egos and sad souls, trapped in dungeons of their own making.</p>

<p align=left>And second, the not so obvious. Beyond the stench and decay, the chants and incantations, there is a darker secret within the halls of the undead. And to those of us who know and understand the true nature of things, it is quite clear. As a man of the virtues, I shall share a bit of what I know, and as it should be, I will leave the rest for ye to find. </p>

<p align=left>The Undead are a poison, a leech that feeds on the emotional distress of humanity. The reason they do this? Because the smallest bit of humanity that is left in the husk of the undead yearns for the rich and vibrant magic that only humanity posseses. The warmth that we take for granted, the excitement, the joy, contentment... all this is lost to the undead, and in the vacuume that is created, there is simply cold, barren rage.</p>

<p align=left>And all this to amass power. Throughout all the dark tomes, ye will find references to this search of theirs. Souls are sold, schemes are hatched, murders are commited...all in the hopes of slicing off a bit of influence, a bit of power that allows a once small man to stomp about and huff and puff, demanding, of all things, respect. </p>

<p align=left>The forces of darkness would have ye believe that in their hands they hold the key to not only limitless power, but uninterrupted life. An interesting idea, and so alluring... </p>

<p align=left>But do not be fooled my friends, there is no power in undeath, merely an extension of evil, a manifestation that is the darkness in our hearts. What you see in the ranks of the undead are the leavings of a weak human being...attempting to be remade into something more. But less of a human is..less of a human, no matter what ye take in trade.</p>

<p align=left>Aye, and the price ye pay is never ending. Them that would take pride in recieving counsel from the undead are merely a weakened human being, looking for an escape. The saddest of all is that it never takes long for those afflicted with the weakness to realize that although they walk as a rotting corpse, the weakness they attempted escape is now, utterly and forever, a part of them. </p>

<p align=left>At this point, I have shared with ye much of the discussion that is held within the halls of Virtue. And I have yet to even touch the meat of the matter. And although my collegues and I have much more to share, we feel it best to share only a bit of our philosophy at this juncture, a calling card if ye will. A message that is one of many more to come, a suggestion to the undead that their reign does not go unchallenged...</p>

<p align=left>And so it begins.</p>
