<blockquote>
<p align=left>A cold chill ran through Neriak, such a beloved sensation. A slight breeze blew across the top of the Commons river, causing small waves to begin to break against the cold inner walls. Sitting high above the water, Tanamrya B'Dynn rested in utter boredom in the middle of her watch. Looking down, she waited patiently....as all Indigo Brotherhood members were trained. Picking up a small pebble, the daughter of the exiled Dorn B'Dynn slung the rock with fickle passion. Its impact into the water formed quick ripples, that died as quickly as her career was doing. Her quest to return the B'Dynn House to power in Neriak was failing, and her heart was running over with hatred.....hatred for those invading raiders....hatred for her own people. Removing a small polishing cloth from her back pack, Tanamrya began to rub the blood stains from her battle hardened bronze plate. Not just her blood of course, it was mixed Troll and Tier Dal. A pair of Troll guards, Ratraz and Thumpin, had given her the run around on the location of Hulkulks bracers a few eves back. Both now mysteriously met their demise, such was the work of the "Neriak Invaders" she had informed her superiors. The frosty, white hairs on her neck stood on end as a slight noise chimed across the way. The sound of metal armor scraping cold stone was a unique sound indeed.....a sound Tanamrya B'Dynn loved with uncontrollable hatred. Standing slowly, she removed her barbed whip, Jiv'Elggur, and her ancient enchanted blade, Dro Olplynirur. Two separate sounds were causing a disturbance in her little world, soon she would be the end of theirs. Taking a few steps back, Tanamrya raced forward and dove off the top of the wall. Her graceful insertion into the cold water left very little echo in the stagnant night. As her body moved stealthily through the water, the two bodies slowly crept along the outer wall in unknowing innocence. Very soon their paths would cross with death herself, more soon than either had hoped.</p>
<p align=left>As the two halfling raiders moved out of their burrowed entrance, the younger of the two scraped into the wall. Its quite sound echoed in the near vicinity like he had dropped a shield on the ground. Turning, the Leatherfoot Deputy waved a hand of silence. The young one looked down, his first mission he had already goofed up three times. Maybe sneaking into dark places wasn't his calling after all, echoed in the back of his mind. Turning to look behind him, a quick pain seared into his neck. As the barbed whip wrapped around his neck, he watched in panicked fear as a bronze plated inky smiled in utter anticipation. As her arms pulled quickly, darkness overtook his eyes....and his short, life. A crack and a double thud brought the Leatherfoot Deputies attention back to his apprentice, "What has he done this time?" he wondered. Turning slowly, a mere inches from his face glared a set of red, feral eyes hidden behind a bronze, skull shaped mask. "Hello PECK!" she screamed as a quick kick sent him reeling backwards. "Feel the skilled fury of a Neriak Dragoon you FOOL!" she sang in pure hatred. "Not this time infamous harbinger....the day is mine" he retorted in hope of maintaining his courage. Drawing his bronze blade, the little Deputy brought it up to parry her sword blow...as the battle began. A quick lash at his ankles and he was taken off his feet early in the engagement. The whip cut deep into his ankles, causing a burning pain to shoot up his short legs. Rolling quickly to avoid a bronze boot to his face, the Deputy fell into the cold water. "On no you don't peck, TIME TO DIE!" she yelled while she dove in after him. His little feet kicked as best they could, his only hope of escape was to out-swim this bronze murderer he had came to assassinate. Climbing up to a rock, he quickly looked around to organize his surroundings. The little mans mind quickly recalled the maps, and guessed his position was directly above the windowed bar...the "something" Fish. A lash of leather came cracking out of the cold, blue river of hate. His instincts held fast as his body rolled quickly to the side, dodging the blow. Jumping up, a quick defensive stance he stood. Looking before him, the water caused the bronze armor to almost glow. "You are no fun, no fun indeed peck....now...I fear you will see all your friends I have murdered....send them my regards......EL!" she screamed cracking her whip once more. The quick Leatherfoot Deputy dodged to the right again, right into the enchanted blade. Looking up to his attacker, she smiled insanely, "Duel wield is an art form....is it not deadman?" Pushing forward the blade jutted out his small back. A gurgle of slurred words escaped his mouth as she took his bronze blade. "Yes, the stories are true my little peck......you all die with your own weapons." With this, she brought the bronze long sword down into his neck, beheading him in the stagnant night.</p> 
<p align=left>"Good work Traitors Daughter," Seloxia Punox sneered at the wet Tier Dal warrior standing before her. Tanamrya hated this women with a vengeance, once day she hoped she could usurp her from power. Title, "Traitors Daughter", was all she was known by in Neriak. Not by her selfless defense of its walls, not by its silent assassinations in foreign lands....but by her fathers revenge on House Punox. They were rumored to have been the ones that killed her mother, a rumor that sent many of them to their grave. On that dreadful night of her mothers murder, Dorn B'Dynn had slain nearly every Punox in Neriak before strong magic held him fast. His banishment sent a stir through the hierarchy. Everyone had wanted to see him publicly executed, but someone waved that verdict. That unseen hand not only saved her fathers life, but also ensured she was taken care of over the years. Whomever...whatever it was, this unseen force had protected Tanamrya from her own people....and led her to slay others. Placing the small cap on Seloxia's desk, Tanamrya turned and left the office. With her watch over, she quietly faded into the night air....to whatever destination fate brought her next.</p>
