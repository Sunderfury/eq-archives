<p align=left><b>The Last Autumn on Ro Shore</b><br><i>by Cyrssi Treeskin</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It was a typical autumn night. The leaves were rustling, there was a slight chill in the air, and the call of birds migrating south could be heard everywhere I went. I had just returned to my homeland of Faydwer; my brother had sent a most disturbing letter and I prayed to Tunare that the winds would guide SirensBane swift and true so that I may join him in Kelethin. The letter read:</p>

<p align=left>My dearest sister,<br><br>

I fear that something terrible is going to happen. I'm not one for superstitions and fortunetelling, but I talked with a gypsy last night and chills ran down my spine. I am not sure what it all means. I am sorry that I cannot elaborate any further in this letter, lest it end up in the wrong hands. Please come home as soon as you can, Cyrssi. I must see you within the week.
<br><br>
I promise I will explain further upon your return home. Please trust me on this...time may be against us.
<br><br>
Your brother,
Elandel</p>

<p align=left>I arrived in Kelethin and swiftly tracked down my brother. "Elandel," I said, "What seems to be troubling you so that you needed to send for me?" </p>

<p align=left>"I had a most disturbing encounter with a gypsy a few days ago," he said. "She foretold of a disappearance."</p>

<p align=left>"Whose disappearance?"</p>

<p align=left>"Of that I am not sure. She would not tell me. She did, however, tell me where the disappearance would take place. That is what upset me, for I knew that we would both be there within the week; and within the week is when the deed is to take place," he said, looking gravely concerned.</p>

<p align=left>I looked up at Elandel, having been concentrating on the floorboards during the conversation. "Oh. Then there is only one solution. We must not go there," I said quietly. "But where is 'there'? You haven't mentioned it yet. Why have you avoided that?"</p>

<p align=left>Elandel took a deep breath and said, "I have been reluctant to tell you because it is a place that holds meaning for you. I just wanted to be sure that you were ready to hear it."</p>

<p align=left>"I will be fine, brother. We have grown up strong and have had great guidance from Uncle Aanlain and Uncle Preth. Please tell me where it will take place," I said.</p>

<p align=left>"The Northern Desert of Ro."</p>

<p align=left>"Kalyne..." I whispered. "She...she...disappeared there too. One of my best friends growing up," I said, feeling tears begin to well up in my eyes. "It's been five years...." I said softly.</p>

<p align=left>Elandel gave me a hug and said, "I know. It will be a difficult thing to do, but we must go there. We need to find out what that gypsy was talking about. My mind won't be at ease until I find the answer."</p>

<p align=left>I nodded in agreement. We sat and talked about recent adventures, trying to lighten the mood. We visited some old friends whom we hadn't seen in years, and I made us some dinner and drinks. We talked on late into the night about many things, eventually falling asleep under the stars.</p>

<p align=left>We woke the next morning and made the trek back to Freeport. We searched the city for the gypsy that had talked to Elandel earlier in the week, but she was nowhere to be found. We continued our search through the Commonlands, but again to no avail. Disenheartened, we set out for the Northern Desert of Ro.</p>

<p align=left>We arrived in the desert and asked about the gypsy. No one had seen her. We went to the Oasis of Marr and had little luck there as well. We found the tracks of quite a few madmen and mummies, and decided to make the Oasis a little more safe for fellow travellers. Gradishar, a kinsman bard, invited us to join him on his hunt when we crossed paths that eve, but we were weary from our travels and declined his offer. He invited us to join him the next day, and we agreed that we would do so.</p>

<p align=left>That night as we slept, I had a terrible dream. I don't remember all the details, but it seemed to be a re-enactment of Kalyne's disappearance five years earlier...but there was a gypsy there in the dream, and I couldn't recall there being one at the time Kalyne vanished. Kalyne walked toward me, but as she drew nearer her face took on the features of Elandel. That is when I was woken by Elandel, as it was time for the hunt with Gradishar. I dismissed the end of my dream as knowing that my brother was waking me up. I felt rather woozy, and told Elandel to join Gradishar and send my regrets, as I did not feel well enough to join in the hunt.</p>

<p align=left>Later that day, Elandel came back but did not look well. I asked him, "What happened? You don't look so well."</p>

<p align=left>"We ran into a camp of Dervishes. It was decided that we were going to show them that they weren't welcome. We were victorious, yet we were also lucky to escape with our lives. It was a tough battle," he said wearily.</p>

<p align=left>"I can tell that not all that has shaken you up, " I said. "What else happened on that hunt?"</p>

<p align=left>"We were in the heat of battle," he said. "We took out the caster first then went on to the others. But another caster showed up. He used a spell I had never seen before, and it hit me with such a force that it knocked me out. Sometime before Gradishar brought me back to consciousness, I had a vision..." Elandel's voice was trembling and his hands were shaking. I gave him a hug, hoping to calm him, then he went on.</p>

<p align=left>"Where was I? Oh yes...the vision," Elandel shivered. "I saw myself in the desert, looking out towards the sea, and then..."</p>

<p align=left>"It's ok. Take your time. You don't have to tell me now."</p>

<p align=left>"And then...my image just disappeared, and all I could see was the shoreline and the water," he said.</p>

<p align=left>"Oh."</p>

<p align=left>The night was getting late, and we were both very tired. "Promise me you'll stay here with me tonight," Elandel said. "I will sleep better knowing you are here, and in the morning we can discuss this some more."</p>

<p align=left>"Anything for you, brother," I said, pulling the only blanket around him. "I will stay up a bit, yet. I will not leave you, though. You have my word." I pulled my cloak tightly around me and stared across the water, wondering what the events of the past few days all really meant. I don't remember falling asleep, nor waking up, but I do remember what I saw when I woke up. That I will never forget.</p>

<p align=left>I awoke in the morning with the sun shining brightly. I stood up, stretched, and looked for Elandel so that I could wake him up and see if he was feeling better. The blanket was lying where he had been, but Elandel was gone. At first I thought that perhaps he had gone to get some food or water, but the lack of footprints in the sand proved otherwise.</p>

<p align=left>It was then that I realized that the gypsy had been talking about him all along. The dream I had and the vision Elandel had all made sense now. I fell to my knees and sat in the sand. I looked out on the ocean, picked up the blanket, and began to cry.</p>

<p align=left>I do not remember when I stopped crying. It seemed like forever. My heart felt like it had dropped to the other side of the world. At that moment, everything came crashing down, shattering into a million pieces, leaving me to wonder where to go from there. My brother, whom I had spent all my life growing up an adventuring with, had vanished without a trace. Just as Kalyne had. No note, no explanation, no hug or goodbyes. Just gone.</p>

<p align=left>I folded the blanket and put it in my pack, and trudged on to East Freeport. I don't know how I got there...I was in such a daze. I made my way to the docks and silently stared across the Ocean of Tears. What an appropriate name, I thought. The boat arrived, and I set off for my homeland, hoping to find solace among the trees in the forest known as Faydark.</p>
