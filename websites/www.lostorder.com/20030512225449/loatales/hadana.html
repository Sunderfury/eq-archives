<p align=left><b>The Meeting</b><br><i>by Hadana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>*looks about her small home, thinking of this evenings meeting*</p>

<p align=left>My son came to me this eve. Asked me if I was ready to meet his chosen girl. I nodded my readiness an off he went to get her. I rushed about straightening a bit here and there then sat down to compose myself.</p>

<p align=left>My Hakadek, brought his Azyana to me. My impressions were favorable even though she is horribly disfigured without a beard. She looked somewhat strong and formidable and as if she is training to be a good cleric. </p>

<p align=left>I hope she will join her heart with my son. Help him on his quest to clear his fathers name. I long to wear my husbands name proudly once again, and see my son in with it. Hopefully together they can unravel the mystery.</p>

<p align=left>I feel that once she learns to cook and sew and builds up her strength she can bear me the grandbabes I long for. Though she did pale considerably at the thought of a mere 7 children. Good thing I did not mention that 9 would be an ideal number of children to make a family.</p>

<p align=left>May they be quick and successful on their quest together. I hope to attend the wedding soon.</p>

<p align=left>*puts the lovely necklace Azyana gave her away for safekeeping and retires to the bed*</p>
