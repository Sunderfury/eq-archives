<p align=left><b>The Veterans</b><br><i>by Diencet</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>We start our story with the Druid and Ranger making their way from the Dangerous home of The Runnyeye Goblins.</p>

<p align=left>Ranger: Well druid where shall head next now that we have wiped clean the dungeon Runnyeye (as he wipes the blood of his dirk and sword).</p>

<p align=left>Druid: Well we are battle hardened fighters I say theres not much that can stand in our way (as he sits to read his bloodied worn book.</p>

<p align=left>Our heros agree on this and decided to set out to the coomons to slay some of the undead in Befallen. They soon arrive at the destination and Kick in the doors of the place known as befallen the mist covers them and the undead scramble in fear of the two fighters, a smirk crosses their faces as the ranger starts swinging cutting the undead into the druid opens up with many pwoerful blasts reaking havoc on the rats and skeletons.with much haste they clear the floor and grab the key from the weak shadow knight.</p>

<p align=left>Ranger: Hahaha did you see the expression on that last rat I laid my sword upon!! (he cackles with glee)</p>

<p align=left>Druid: Aye and did you see the way my lighting ripped thru the last skeleton that cowered in the corner!</p>

<p align=left>The fighters made their way thru the corridors demolishing everything in sight.They quickly rush the next room to slay the shadow knight that would spawn there soon! When suddenly the ranger dissappeared..petrified screams came from all around the druid.</p>

<p align=left>Druid: Ranger Ranger where did you go!?</p>

<p align=left>Ranger: Ahh helllpppp me ahhhh I have fallen in a hole and the rats are gonna get me!!!</p>

<p align=left>The Druid spies the hole the ranger fell into and jumps into the unseen,landing next to the ranger who was beset upon by the most evil vile rats and small skeletons you have ever seen. But together once again the fend of the swarm of the lesser evil in Norrath.and look at each other confidently when and avery very large skeleton (not much bigger than a dwarf) rushed in and starts to hit the powerful druid.</p>

<p align=left>Druid: (in a high pitched screech) Ranger ahhh help Ranger it is terrible.</p>

<p align=left>The ranger quickly rushes over to aide his friend. They dispatch of this threat also. Making their way thru the only door in the romom they come into a hallway splitting three way ..left,right and straight they choose straight and head for the door.The masses of evil vile powerful undead swarm them (akin to a giant group of bixies attacking a griifon) they barely manage to stay alive when another wave hits them the ranger waneing on health the druid nearly out of mana..they have at them fighting valiantly the druid steps back and smiles starts to cast his sprumem magiks to heal the bard only to cast upon the evil skeleton (slightly more menacing than a orc pawn) they come out on top again. They find a place to sit and rest while healing there wounds as some of the younger Norrathians scuttle by laughing often tuanting"woohoo look at the veterans sitting and healing their whooped arses" while they chase down some innocent poor Necro.</p>

<p align=left>Ranger: Druid we must find our way out of here and fast with a sense of urgency.</p>

<p align=left>Druid: The druid stops whimpering long enough to agree with the Ranger.."Yes, lets run really fast out of here".</p>

<p align=left>They pick up again and make haste in no particular direction all the while creating a train the size of the Oriental express and then it happens...yes ..the dreaded ..DEAD END! Quickly they feel to the multiples of the lands strongest undead (gnome skeletons some dwarfs a few rats and a Necro man) they find themselves back where they started near their old stomping grounds known as Runnyeye where they had won many a battle and slayed many a goblin.</p>

<p align=left>Ranger:Umm lets don't tell anybody.</p>

<p align=left>Druid: Tell them about what?! (nods and winks)</p>

<p align=left>After failing to recover their corpses and gating out the druid recieved a tale from some of the elder in his clan known as LOA..he was coming to help!! The ranger and the druid acted quickly grabbing handfuls of dirt smearing it about them messing up their hair and ripping what clothes they had.</p>

<p align=left>Druid: OK, how does this look?</p>

<p align=left>Ranger: Like you have been in the fiercest of battles!</p>

<p align=left>Soon the tall fighter showed up and with ease swathed a path of bones and rat throught the whole og befallen all the while the 2 veterans tried to hide their faces from the onlookers who pointed and called out, "Look there they go the mighty fighters ...need some help often yelled a mag or enc of 5 or 6 years!"</p>

<p align=left>Needless to say they recieved their corpses and swore themselves to secracy all along the tall saviour of the two chuckled and often had to stop and catch his breath from laughing. This is completely hearsay but I could have sworn that night I saw a naked wood elf druid and ranger running through the plains of the commonlands!</p>
