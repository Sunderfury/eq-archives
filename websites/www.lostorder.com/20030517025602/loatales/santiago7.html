<p align=left><b>Santiago the Monk</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>“So let me get this straight,” said Santos, folding his hands together on top of the table. “You want to become a monk?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago nodded eagerly. “Aye, matey!”</p>

<p align=left>The friar made a smiled politely. “May I ask why?”</p>

<p align=left>“Why?” Santiago frowned. “Do ye need a reason?”</p>

<p align=left>“Most certainly,” said Santos. “Our Order is not something that one enters whimsically. It requires a deep commitment to the path of Virtue.”</p>

<p align=left>“Oh, I got Virtue,” said Santiago. “Practic’lly comin’ out me ears, it is!”</p>

<p align=left>“Indeed,” said Santos. “Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago waved his hand. “Fire away, matey!”</p>

<p align=left>“Would you we willing to sacrifice all your gold for the sake of charity?”</p>

<p align=left>“What gold? I lost it all playin’ cards the other night.”</p>

<p align=left>“But if someone gave you…say, one hundred gold crowns. What would you do with the money?”</p>

<p align=left>“A hundred gold? Blimey!” Santiago thought for a moment. “I’d give it to the needy.” After all, he thought, the ladies at Bertha’s Brothel always seemed to be needy!</p>

<p align=left>“Would you be willing to live a life of humility, forsaking pride and fame?”</p>

<p align=left>“Matey, I’m the most humble bloke ye ever met. If thar’s one lesson what life keeps teachin’ me, it’s a kick in the arse whenever I start thinkin’ I’m more than what I am.”</p>

<p align=left>“Would you be chaste?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago frowned. “Aye, I get chased all the time, matey. Whether it’s the king’s men, or ol’ pirate enemies, or ladies what I’ve given offense to…”</p>

<p align=left>“That wasn’t quite what I meant,” interrupted Santos. “Would you be willing to forsake earthly pleasures, and devote your life entirely to Virtue?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago blinked a couple of times, and scratched his head.</p>

<p align=left>“Would you be willing to give up women?” said Santos bluntly.</p>

<p align=left>“Oh, hell, matey! In a quick snap, I would! Women ain’t caused me nothin’ but trouble these past few weeks. I’m done with ‘em altogether!”</p>

<p align=left>“So you would not be tempted if, say, a beautiful young woman approached you and offered herself to you, claiming that she was hopelessly and utterly in love with you?”</p>

<p align=left>“Heck no, matey. If she’s that crazy, she’s better left alone. Thar’s somethin’ wrong with a lass what takes a fancy to me.”</p>

<p align=left>Santos thought for a moment. “Santiago, I will be honest with you. I am not sure that you would make a good monk. But if you truly wish to attempt it, you may do so. Our doors are open to any who seek the path of Virtue.”</p>

<p align=left>“No foolin’? I can really be a monk?”</p>

<p align=left>The friar smiled. “Yes. But I warn you, the path of Virtue is not an easy one. As an acolyte, you will be expected to stay on the path, and never stray from it. Do you understand?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago nodded. “I’ll be the best darn’d monk ye ever heard of…just you wait an’ see! Say…when do I get a robe?”</p>

<p align=left>“I will see what I can find,” said Santos with a smile. “But for now, go to the Chapel. Meditate upon the path that you have chosen. Oh, and if you see Brother Jacob, please ask him to come and see me.”</p>

<p align=left>“Awright,” the young “Thank ye, matey!” Santiago vigorously shook the friar’s hand.</p>

<p align=left>“You are welcome. Good luck, Santiago.”</p>

<p align=left>A few minutes later, a young monk stepped into the friar’s office. “You wanted to see me, sir?”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes,” said Santos. “It appears that we have a new acolyte.”</p>

<p align=left>Jacob’s eyes brightened. “Oh, indeed? Who, sir?”</p>

<p align=left>“Santiago.”</p>

<p align=left>The light went out of Jacob’s face.</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, I know, I know.” Santos closed his eyes and massaged his forehead. “But he deserves a chance. I would like you to keep an eye on him, though, to make sure he doesn’t get into too much trouble.”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, sir.” Jacob left the office, his shoulders slumped and his gait unsteady. His expression was that of a man who had just been asked to stop an avalanche with his bare hands.</p>

<p align=left>After Jacob left, Santos sighed and looked up at the ceiling. “You’re testing me, aren’t you?”</p>
