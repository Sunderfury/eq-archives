<p align=left><b>Enchanter's Tome, Page One</b><br><i>by Brigadyr</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>My name is Brigadyr; an enchanter by trade. I arrived in Dereth today, curious to see what trappings had lured my dear friend Solf from my native land of Norrath. I was happy to find I could illusion myself after a native race of Dereth, and I chose a green-eyed, flame-haired Gharu'ndim as my model. After finding out all I could from guides and helpful signposts, I made my way from Nanto's East outpost to Nanto itself. Along the way I saw some curious creatures that I had never seen the likes of before -- brown rabbits and snowmen -- and I poked them with my staff. They proved to be quite weak, and consequently died. Snowman carrots are tasty, though.</p>

<p align=left>I talked to many in Nanto, finding out the ins and outs of the area. I visited many shops and inquired of their wares, then decided to see about travelling to Hebian-To, as it sounded like such a place as I might find the whereabouts of Solf. </p>

<p align=left>I walked along the path, poking and prodding every rabbit and snowman I saw. I reached the Nanto North outpost and saw a curious blue stone...a Lifestone they call it...it seems to perform an act similar to our affinity binding in Norrath. I touched it, and felt my spirit attune to the stone. I picked up a few apples that had fallen on the ground, and proceeded northward.</p>

<p align=left>I hadn't travelled too far from the outpost when I was attacked from behind by a nasty green wasp. I was caught offguard and completely disoriented, and thus I died to the wrath of that miserable little creature. Twas a good thing I touched that stone. It is too bad that I lost half my money and the healing tonic the training master had so kindly given me, but material things can be replaced.</p>

<p align=left>I decided that I should rest, as the whole experience was rather overwhelming. I sat here, inside the outpost building, and started to write this entry. And now that I have told my tale, tis time to rest. Perhaps I shall soon find Solf so that I may see him once again.</p>
