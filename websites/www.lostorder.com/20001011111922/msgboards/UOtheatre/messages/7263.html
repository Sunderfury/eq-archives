<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">First, I'd decide what kind of bard you want...I think determining a direction for your character is the best advice I can give; also, seems like Bard alone is not the best adventuring bard...most adventuring bards are bard/tamer, or bard/mage, or even bard/warrior (my own choice).  This means in addition to music, provoke and peacemaking (peacemaking is debated by some, as is entice; many have abandoned entice, with the only champions being pvp or exploiters), you'll want to look at raising some other skills.  I (like Talesn) sort of favor the play while you gain method.  I think both Tal and I could warn you that this method takes time.  [18+ months for me to GM bard]  Still, it is decidedly less boring and you can accumulate some worthwhile gold.  Bards are interesting in that they are the among the best "solo" adventurers, and yet they are also wonderful in group situations.  My best tip?  When your musicianship gets stuck in the 90s, buy a boat and go sailing...</font>
