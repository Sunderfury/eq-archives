<p align=left><b>To the Dark Mistress of the Cauldron of Hate</b><br><i>by Drachiero</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>My Queen,</p>

<p align=left>If suffering is a necessary element of a warrior’s existence, then I am well on my way. I am starting to become acquainted with deception, difficulty and defeat, just as you said I would. I will strive to steel myself against these pitfalls – and in time, I hope to emerge from the fires of the anvil as a well-tempered weapon.</p>

<p align=left>Patience, the first lesson. I have spent what seems an eternity cloistered in the caverns of Neriak, devoting myself entirely to the teachings of the Teir’Dal. My eyes are attuned to darkness, and I can now find my way in even the darkest shadows.</p>

<p align=left>Humility, too – for I have been deprived of everything except a sword, a tunic and a meager supply of food and water. What I earn from this point forward, I will earn on my own.</p>

<p align=left>I have also learned not to trust others, nor to rely upon them. For I was told that there were many others who were interested in the Teir’Dal, and that they would gather in Neriak on this very night. So I wandered the labyrinthine streets for almost an hour, trying to find these others. In the end, I found only three – one of whom was not even a member of our Lost Order. So, disillusioned – or enlightened, depending upon how you look at it – the four of us set our to practice our skills at combat. We were mildly successful, only falling once to a swarm of fire beetles.</p>

<p align=left>And then the true test. We were called upon to deliver a message to Ambassador K’rynn in Oggok. Four letters were distributed, one for each of us, in the hope that at least one of our number would survive to reach the final destination. And only one of us did; the rest fell prey to the dangers of the desert. I myself was brought low by the sharp claws and teeth of a wandering puma before the Eldritch Binding delivered me back to Nektulos with all my wounds healed – except for the pang of failure.</p>

<p align=left>I have endured all of these hardships, and will faithfully continue to do so. But I must know…are we to be alone in this? You said there would be others, but where were they? In this one thing, I require honesty; I humbly beg that you tell me the truth this time.</p>

<p align=left>Your loyal and obedient servant,</p>

<p align=left>Drachiero</p>
