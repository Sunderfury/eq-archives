journal - both in contents and in publishing interval, although I never
forsaw such a long delay between issues. Before I forget I must thank Gradishar
for the article in the last issue about the Walaryn Gnome clan - it appears
that I accidently left his name out as the author - bad me! Anyway read
on for more on the madness that is the Lost Order of Akalabeth! As always

in great numbers all pledging their services to the Paladins Zirc and Dargo.
We were here to get a legendary sword, Ghoul's Bane, off the lord of the
dank dungeon of Guk. We descended for many miles searching for the throne
room of the Shin Lord and battled a vast array of frogs and fungis men.
Wherever the Order went battles were won and lives lost yet still we bravely
ventured onward. The courage that I saw!</font>

such valiant members is indeed a blessing from Tunare. We never found the
Shin Lord. We waited for many days for the fiend to return but he never
did.&nbsp;Even so, the LOA rallied together and fought the Lord's minions

<br><b>BARBARIANS TIE THE KNOT</b>
<br>Rumours that have been spreading recently about a possible union between
that pair of unwashed barbarians Waran and Azlana were recently confirmed.
A translator for the pair announced that yes the two were engaged to be
married, however he did not go as far as stating when the union would actually
take nor did he deny the rumour that the father of the bride to be had
to bribe the burly barbarian with tinkets and copious amounts of ale to
actually wed his daughter.

<br><b>SPATE OF KILLINGS SHOCK SOUTH KARANA RESIDENTS</b>
<br>The suprise killings of known and loved residents of South Karana,
Quillmane the Pegasus and Grizzleknot the Treant has left many residents
of the area stunned and fearful of their lives, according to a local Hermit
who wishes to remain anonymous. Both these creatures were last seen in
the company of a strange wolf, and then went missing for a number of a
days until their corpses were found in scrub covered by insect stings.
The local unkempt druids were reportedly outraged by this...</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="194"><b>RUNNEYE RAN WITH BLOOD!</b>
<br>Early Sunday morning Dearg, Gildan, Woozle, Aillean, and Grogor consented
to take a mere
<br>babe-in-arms named Argil with them into the depths of the Goblin fortress.
The young mage reportedly comported himself quite well, alternating valiant
meditation with courageously fleeing from the larger goblins at every opportunity.&nbsp;
Many times the high-pitched shriek "Help! There's one on me! Get it off,
get it off!!!" was heard, and every time the group responded by
<br>covering their ears and taunting the goblins off the white-robed neophyte.
Occasionally, the lanky High Elf valiantly stabbed a weaker goblin in the
back with his miniscule dagger.&nbsp; Rumors of his robe having been soiled
in terror, however, were completely baseless.&nbsp; That was... rust, from
a rusty short sword.
<p>Ahem.&nbsp; In any case, the group was quite successful in their assault.&nbsp;
Once the "King's Room" was gained, the group settled into a rhythm which
proved to be quite effective.&nbsp; Killing goblins and goblin workers
at every opportunity seemed to cause the group's main target, the Evil
Eye Borxx, to appear more frequently.&nbsp; In fact, by the end of the
adventure, every member of the group had possession of at least one of
the foul lenses.&nbsp; While Woozle the Balding Gnome insisted on having
his lens crafted into a beannie (+10 to saves vs Hair Loss), he did consent
to assist other group members in their acquisition of the coveted Staff
of the Observers (unlimited charges of Voyeurism).&nbsp; All hail Woozle!
<p>Sadly, these gains did not come without price.&nbsp; The group was victimized
twice by huge trains brought to them coutesy of some other groups of...
questionable ethics.&nbsp; Gildan fell twice, defending the rear and ensuring
that the rest of the group made it to safety.&nbsp; Rumor has it that he
was last
<br>seem in Steamfont wearing some sharp-looking black leggings.. but those
may have just been sweatpants.

<br><b>THE CENATURS OF SOUTH KARANA</b>
<br>As part of our ongoing efforts to vainly drag our readers out of an
intellectual mire that appears be bogging down the populace of Norrath,
we present another thought-provoking and totally unsubstantiated view of
the world...
<br>For eons centaurs have trotted across the grassy plains of the South
Karanas living in harmony with it's other major inhabitants, the Gnolls
and the Aviaks. But just what are these creatures that&nbsp;
<br>(continued next column....)</td>

<td VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="175">appear to be a cross between a man and some
other beast unkown to the world? At first glance centaurs are merely peaceful
sentient creatures that carry bows and adorn themselves with armour, but
underneath this lies a strong social culture, and a well-defined ordering
within them from the weakest foals to the strongest charger. To harass
one is to invite the wrath of the entire village, although if done in secrecy
naught will be done to the perpretator. The reasons for this are as yet
unknown - perhaps they believe the centaur to be taken by one of the many
cyclopses that roam the area or mayhap they simply do not care. Whatever
the the reason is a matter for another debate as now this space is filled.

<br><b>A RESPONSE TO THE HISTORY OF THE ELVEN RACE...</b>
<br>I am writing in response to your recent article implying that High
Elves and Wood Elves are in fact one race.&nbsp; Your suggestion that the
noble High Elves of Felwithe are related in anything more than name to
the animal-like Wood Elves of Kelethin is shocking and disgusting.&nbsp;
An slobbrering Ogre could tell us apart (just from looking at us I mean...
I have it on good faith that Wood Elf tastes "just like chicken", but I
know of no Ogre who has
<br>attempted to eat a High Elf and survived)&nbsp; But I&nbsp; digress...
<br>Let me present to you, in a lowbrow manner I hope will not excede your
cognitive capacity, a few ways to tell the difference between a High Elf
and a Wood Elf:
<br>1)&nbsp; High Elves honor both trees and our cousins the Naiads, eternal
spirits of our beloved trees.&nbsp; Wood Elves build cities out of them.
<br>2)&nbsp; High Elves assist the process of natural selection through
carefully arranged marriages between our highest families.&nbsp; Wood Elves
perform this function after birth, by allowing their slowest and stupidest&nbsp;
children (relatively speaking, of course) to fall to their deaths.
<br>3)&nbsp; Young High Elven maidens wear the latest in fashionable evening
wear out
<br>of Felwithe, and always look prim and proper.&nbsp; Young Wood Elf
wenches look
<br>as if they should be dancing on stage in a sleazy Freeport tavern.
<br>4)&nbsp; High Elf young men look like Spock; Wood Elf boys look like
Johnny Depp.
<br>5)&nbsp; Lastly, one of these two races is disparagingly called "Woodies"...
and it's NOT the High Elves.
<br>High Elves: we're not snobs, we're just better than them.
<p>Argil Silverlock
<p>Ed replies: Ah 'tis a sad thing indeed to be both misguided and unknowing
of one's past.
