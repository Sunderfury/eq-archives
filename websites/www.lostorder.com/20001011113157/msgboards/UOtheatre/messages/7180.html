I am not someone who likes to fight other people and I never have attacked someone who has not harmed me first.

Melee for example does a skill check each time you swing.  Most skills are also difficulty based.  It seems funny that you can get as far provoking mongbats as you can provoking elementals.  However, I tried to play a bard on SP and found that you could never provoke higher monsters like orc mages no matter how good my barding skills were.  That is why I stopped playing on SP... so I would hope that if you go to difficulty based skill advancement, you do not duplicate that.<p>Too often we forget about the strange relationship in UO of NPC's to Monsters and to PCs.  In a world where NPC's roam about and are immune from attack by Monsters, they have become nothing more than some kind of animal.  If they were attacked by monsters, then there would be something to defend.  Right now my evil bard can entice NPC's who are wearing those lovely colored sandals out of town.  She is not a violent person... and would far prefer to talk them out of the sandals...  or even steal them.  Unfortunately, they are also very attached to them.  And the rules of the game require me to kill them in order to claim my prize....<p>Thank you for listening.  I have been playing UO since release.
