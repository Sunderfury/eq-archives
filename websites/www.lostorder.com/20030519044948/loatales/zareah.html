<p align=left><b>The Battle of the Saint and the Skeleton Continues</b><br><i>by Saint Zareah</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Zareah awoke to the sounds of battle outside his window upstairs in the House of Architects. Doing some quick mental calculations, he realized that today was the typical day for OES raids. Funny that he had slept through most of it. The harpy battle from the previous day must have really drained him. Zareah shrugged; killing over 50 of the foul birds would do that to a man.</p>

<p align=left>He sat up on the side of his bed, stretching the kinks out of his muscular arms. Looking down, he noticed the scars criss-crossing his body. Each one told a story of its own...there was one from a poisoned blade from an assassin near Moonglow, here several puckered puncture scars, where arrows from archers had scored hits. His body was covered with them. He shrugged. That's what robes and armor were for, to cover up the ugly stuff.</p>

<p align=left>Zareah looked out the window. Sure enough, spells were being hurled, the smell of ozone filled the air, and the clash of blades drowned out the screams of the dying. The Guardian reached for his armor, sure that his blade in the melee could turn the tide. Such was the confidence of all of the Guardians of Akalabeth. Seldom did they fight together, but one of them often was the pivotal point in the battle.</p>

<p align=left>All this he thought as he strapped on the pieces of plate, and the tunic of fine chain armor. Quickly scanning the suit, he realized it needed a few repairs, but Broog wasn't around, and it was definitely enough to handle a few OES bullies. His shield was what mattered, for its well-being saved a lot of blows to his armor anyway. It was still as brand new, with only a few nicks from a trolls club to blemish the surface. He strapped it onto his arm, placed his helm atop his head, and left his room, clomping down the stairs to the front door. He checked his pack once for bandages, just to make sure, before stepping out into the clearing.</p>

<p align=left>Zareah smiled as the sounds of battle assaulted his ears. This hiss of energy bolts zipping by, the crash and boom as lightning fell from the heavens, and the roars of summoned daemons as they fell to blade and spell.</p>

<p align=left>The Guardian side-stepped a daemon's sword blade, as it crashed to the ground beside him, and intercepted a kryss stroke meant for one of his brothers. He looked around for the source of much of the chaos. There it was...Killer sitting atop his steed, across the clearing, directing the evil minions in battle. From time to time Killer would launch a spell, but he seemed afraid to join the melee. Zareah strode casually in Killer's direction, drawing his gleaming katana from its sheath as he did.</p>

<p align=left>Killer saw Zareah coming, and fear lit his eyes. A few quick words, and energy tore through the air, blasting at Zareah's chest. He still had never quite figured out how to intercept a spell with his shield. It should be possible, but for some reason, he just couldn't do it.</p>

<p align=left>One measly mage spell wasn't even enough to slow down the competent warrior. He grunted off the pain, yanked a wadded cloth from his pack, and pressed it inside his chest armor, where the skin had bubbled and bled. It would be just fine, and Killer was only 20 yards away. This would be quick and painless, at least for Zareah. Killer started to guide his horse backward, looking for a swift way out.</p>

<p align=left>And all of a sudden he was there...</p>

<p align=left>Directly between Zareah and his prey. A black spectre on a black horse. Mortal enemies they were, Saint Zareah and Gath of Baal. Many battles had they fought, yet none could be decided. Always something interrupted the flow of their blades, either a spell from an enemy, aid from a friend, or the setting of the evening sun after a long-fought battle.</p>

<p align=left>Zareah smiled, and he saw Gath do the same. Killer would live this day. For these two were meant to fight eachother. It was destined to be, from the beginning. Each could sense the other enter the field of battle, and once their eyes met, nothing kept them from coming together.</p>

<p align=left>"Come on, Gath, down off the horse," Zareah cajoled. "It's too beautiful of an animal to be soiled by chips of bone and pieces of cloth, which is all that will be left of you when this is over."</p>

<p align=left>Gath grinned an evil grin as he dismounted, drawing his blade from its place on the mount's side. "We'll see, Lightwalker, who is just 'laying about' when this is all over. I've learned much since last our blades crossed."</p>

<p align=left>"Don't tell me about it, just show me," Zareah urged, gesturing with his blade. "At thy leisure, I'm ready for you, as always."</p>

<p align=left>Gath assumed his stance, which was quite impressive for a skeleton. The Saint always wondered, at the beginning of a fight, just HOW the thing kept its bones from falling apart. No matter. The trick would be to keep them from falling apart when Zareah's blade bounced off them a few dozen times.</p>

<p align=left>Gath came on strong, just as he did every time the two met. Zareah was used to these opening moves, and could walk through them in his sleep. That was the problem with the dead: very little imagination. But what they did, they did well, almost to perfection. For several minutes all that was heard was the ringing of steel, as blades and shields parried blows, struck out, only to be repelled once again.</p>

<p align=left>As usual, Saint Zareah drew "first blood", knocking a few ribs off Gath's frame. His cuts never seemed to hurt the undead creature enough though, while Gath's blade stung Zareah badly every time one snuck through his defense. So Zareah had to strike quickly, scoring many small hits upon his opponent, while dodging the big, sweeping strokes coming at him.</p>

<p align=left>Both fighters could quickly heal the damage done to them. They had fought literally hundreds of battles, and learned at an early age how to toss their weapon to their shield hand for a moment, apply battle dressings, and resume the fighting. It all happened in the blink of an eye. In fact, to one unschooled in hand to hand combat, it might seem as if the wounds were closing of their own volition.</p>

<p align=left>The battle raged back and forth across the village, both combatants nodding in awe at his opponent's displayed skill. Anyone looking on would think that they were but sparring, as never a killing stroke seemed to land. But anyone that knew, knew that these two entities hated eachother deeply, and sought nothing more than to see their foe face-down in the dirt.</p>

<p align=left>Both were bleeding from over a dozen wounds, but Zareah seemed to be getting the upper hand. Gath kept disengaging, desperately seeking the needed time to get his bones knitted back together. He would backpedal for several minutes, parrying blows, until the bones healed, and then he would thrust himself back at the Breather. Zareah, knowing when Gath would need to heal, concentrated on beating on his opponent, only taking the time to heal when Gath started to retreat.</p>

<p align=left>Zareah smiled as he looked around the clearing. All other battle had stopped, with most of the LOA and OES backing up against the walls to watch this epic struggle. Many times had these two fought, and just as many times it had come to a stalemate, with neither having the upper hand. The battle raged for over thirty minutes, with one side gaining the upper hand, then the other.</p>

<p align=left>Finally, both lowered their weapons. It was obvious, neither was going to best the other this day. Frowns crossed their faces as they both removed their helms.</p>

<p align=left>"Once again, I have failed my Order, by allowing you to walk off the battlefield Gath," admitted Saint Zareah.</p>

<p align=left>"And once again, I've allowed your breath to continue polluting the air around Yew."</p>

<p align=left>"Fare thee ill, Darkwalker," saluted Zareah, as he walked away.</p>

<p align=left>"Walk in darkness, Breather," Gath returned, as he mounted his horse and faded into nothingness.</p>

<p align=left>Both were thinking, as they left the field...."This shall continue...."</p>
