<p align=left>Captain's Log: Morningthaw 21</p>

<p align=left>Well its been a fairly busy and exciting two days I must say...</p>

<p align=left>Things were goin' pretty well fer me.  I was back in Lytelthorpe, collecting
gold, and the ocasional bottle of that sweet nector from the lost
distillary.  (I've become quite partial to it).  I was takin' a nice rest
and enjoyin' the eve of the 20'th in the Roasted Shreth after a long day
hunting the distillary, when a messager showed up.  Seems 'e had a message
from me ole mess mate Joxer the Mighty.</p>

<p align=left>Seems the Joxer wanted to meet me in Cragstone.  There has been some talk
among the leadership in the Lost Order of Akalabeth that we should make
either Cragstone, or the nearby fort our home here in Dereth.  Well I
figured I was one portal jump, and a days march away, so there was no sence
in sittin' on me duff guzzlin' ale.</p>

<p align=left>I packed me things and set off.  Me first stop was Rithwic.  This time
though I opted to keep a low profile since I still had a considerable tab at
the Royal Firkin.  I atuned meself to the nearest life stone and started off
fer Cragstone.</p>

<p align=left>The last time I make this walk I remeber that I wound up runnin' fer me life
most of the way.  This time was a little different.  I've regained much of
me ole archery skills since I last made the trip.  This time i figured I
could fight all the beasties I found.  I should have known better.</p>

<p align=left>Not of quarter of the way to Cragstone I met up with a group of outcast
monouga.  I figured I could perferate the group of them afore they go close
enough to do anythin' about.  Once the stars cleared out of me eyes.  I
realized they were throwin' club at me skull.  Well needless to say I
started runnin' again.</p>

<p align=left>Once I out ran that group of monouga, I happened across a nest of red wasps.
I figured, surely here is a group of besties that I can take out at range.
Well I started shootin' arrows, and lo and behold this time me aim was true
and I took down all three of the buggers.  Just as a landed the last wasp, I
reached fer another arrow and realized that I was out.  I was both impressed
and alarmed by this little stroke of luck.  Still I pulled out a bundle of
shafts and arrow heads, made up another quiver full of arrows and continued
on me way.</p>

<p align=left>The rest of me journey went much the same way, lots of runnin' and wonderin'
where on Dereth all me arrows went.  Well by some stroke of luck I managed
to make it all the way to Cragstone in one peice.  I found me ole pale Joxer
enjoyin' an ale at the local tavern Thorsten's Rest.  Not a bad place, but I
certianly won't be puttin' it on me top ten taverns of Dereth list (mostly
since the proprieter's not a pretty lady)</p>

<p align=left>After a wee bit o' restin' and a few mugs of stout, both Joxer and I were
itchin' fer some adventuring.  I asked the barkeep if 'e knew of any good
places to adventure, and he sugested that we take a gander at the isle of
tears.  Seems that bloody place is infested with all sorts of beastie.  I
never believed how right he was until we got there ourselves.</p>

<p align=left>The only want onto that isle is by usin' one of those confounded portals.  I
meself would much rather swim.  Still Joxer and I girded ourselves and set
off. While there we found two things out.  1. we fight very well as a team,
with me bow, and his sword. 2. do not stay in one place there.</p>

<p align=left>On the isle we found all forms of Monougas Shreth, and wasps.  There were
also more than a few drudges and banderlings meaderin' about.  Still we were
cuttin' them down in order quite well till we found the green wasps nest.  I
managed to pick most of them off at a distance, but one got past me arrows.
I reached back to notch one more arrow and stop that bugger's buzin' fer
good when I got the feelin' that somethin' was wrong.  You guessed it, I was
all out of arrows again.  Well I looked at the wasp and it looked at me and
then we both looked at me empty quiver.</p>

<p align=left>I swear the bugger was laughin' at me.</p>

<p align=left>When I came two I was leanin' against the lifestone in Cragstone again.
After a few moment to get me sences back in place I high tailed to back
through the portal and caught up with Joxer.  Seems he'd managed to
obliterate the wasp right after he hosed me down with a rank acid.  Well I
gathered me things, made up a few more arrows and we resumed hunting.</p>

<p align=left>Did I say hunting?  I ment running.</p>

<p align=left>You see, no sooner did I have me another quiver of arrows, then a swarm of
blue wasps buzzed up and tried to bar-b-que us.  Well  we took off runnin'
like the devil him self were after us, mostly because with the fire bolts
those wasps were throwin' it felt like the devil was after us.</p>

<p align=left>We managed to avoid becoming shiskabob, only to stumble into a group of the
biggest shreths I've ever seen.  Well we did what any harded adventure would
do when faced with 2-1 odds like that</p>

<p align=left>We ran again.</p>

<p align=left>This time we didn't stop runnin' till we were jumpin' into the portal back
to Cragstone.</p>

<p align=left>All in all it was a great adventure.  Quite invigeratin' and all.  But
meself I'm going to rest the eve and head back to Rithwic at first light.</p>
