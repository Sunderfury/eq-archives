<blockquote>
<p align=left>The sun was bright as I entered Dereth. Ahead of me I saw the swirling portal leading to the training hall. I took my wand in hand and stepped inside, ready to learn to use my mind and wit as my weapon. My passage taught me much of the ways of the wand...and I emerged from the hall, ready to venture throughout the realm.</p>

<p align=left>I took bearings of my surroundings and headed towards the nearest town, Lytlethorp. I found people going about their business there, but not the infamous Enosh Flam. I did however find a barmaid or three who offered to pay me handsomly to bring him back.</p>

<p align=left>To my dismay, though, I realized that tipping back mugs did not increase one's experience level. So, I equipped my trusty wand and wandered out of the town. Shortly I found a foe to tangle with...the mighty black rabbit. I took aim, incanted the ancient words, and the rabbit burst into flames before me. Doing this a time or two more I thought to myself, "This stuff is easy". Being easy is the same as being boring. So, I wandered farther...</p>

<p align=left>My confidence growing as I went, I started taking on solo drudges and shreths. They didn't fall as quickly as the rabbits, but they did eventually fall to a fireball or lightning bolt.</p>

<p align=left>With dusk settling in, I stumbled across several drudges huddling around a fire. They saw me and charged towards me. I sent one spell in their direction, slowing one down. But the other two were atop me slashing and flailing at me. I learned quickly that a simple shirt is no match for claws and blades...and I learned that spell components do run out...so I ran...straight into a group of shreths. They joined the chase...so I turned and ran again...this time straight into some nasty wasps. My life forces almost gone, I turned another direction and stumbled away...slowly pulling away from them. I found myself in the middle of nowhere...and pulled out my map. After charting a return course, I slowly started back towards Lytlethorp. Several times along the way I had to skirt around bands of beasties...but I eventually made it back.</p>

<p align=left>I learned several valuable things this first day:</p>

<p align=left>1. Young mages should try to work in a team with melee fighters<br>
2. Always carry extra components for spells<br>
3. Armor is well worth the cost!<br>
4. Bring Enosh back for the bounty and avoid the near death experiences that come with hunting</p>

<p align=left>I look forward to many more adventures in Dereth...and will hope to share more experiences here. If anyone cares to meet up in Dereth and give me some advice or hunt together, I would much appreciate it.</p>
