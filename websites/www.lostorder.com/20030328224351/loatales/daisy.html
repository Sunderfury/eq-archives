<p align=left><b>Flower Picking</b><br><i>by Daisy</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The morning was cool and the sun was just dawning in clearing. A lady in blue was wandering about the trees and by the fountain shrubbery, she was carrying a light blue basket with little white and violet flowers riddled inside of it bounceing as she walked. She stoped to admire some snowdrops then smiled and picked a few and put them in her basket. She continued walking around looking at the flowers, the reds, the oranges, the purples, and golds filled her basket. She walked and walked picking flower upon interesting flower, until she came out of her trance of flower picking and looked up...She was in a place she did not know, she was not in her clearing it looked just like the clearing but it wasn't her clearing, she was in a place far different, unstead of glorious colors there was dreary greys and ugly blacks. She stood there looking around, looking in a daze at all the blackness and ugliness...She began to cry, and then darted off dropping her flowers. Tears were streaming of her face, then she just stopped, and just stood there, the tears had subsided and she was in the clearing, the pretty clearing, the serene clearing, she span around a smile as wide as a dragon's and looked at her basket, she felt like she was running for hours...Yet her basket was right beside her, she knew she dropped it way back, but it was here, she was confused, overwhelmed, and tired. She just wanted to leave so she gathered her beautiful basket with the lovely flowers inside it still confused and walked west to the abbey for a nights sleep.</p>
