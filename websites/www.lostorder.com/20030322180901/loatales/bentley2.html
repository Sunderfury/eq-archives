<p align=left><b>A New Beginning (Bentley's Cure)</b><br><i>by Bentley</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The celestial wizard gazed through the enormous telescope with fascination. He frowned a
moment making astronomical calculations in his mind. Another quick glance to the
heavens and it was time. </p>

<p align=left>"Bentley my good man, on the table if you please. The time is neigh." Solar said. </p>

<p align=left>The tall blonde man, with pale blue eyes the color of sky nodded in apprehension and lay
down on the large stone table as requested. Why was he doing this? Was this really what
he wanted? Would he ever truly be free of her? All the doubts and fears he had ever had
came flooding back to him threatening to drown him in indecision. He thought of his
indentured servitude to the deranged Malkavian Maria. It was true that she was an evil and
vile mistress but still. Twice she had chose to save him when others would not. Was it not
Maria who had given him the power to exact revenge against his enemies? Wait! No, he
was confused for it was Maria that killed his love and made him this hideous creature in
the first place! He must be free of her, free of this abominable shell that holds him
prisoner, and free at last from his hunger for vengeance and the blood of others. He
thought of his friends among the Lost Order. Attrael the kind battle chef, Feanor the Elfin
knight Nocixel the fun loving often drunken sailor, and Atlantia the once notorious Blood
Queen of the Sabbat. She has changed he thought. She has changed on all her own
through sheer force of will and now she wants to help me. Bentley sighed and closed his
eyes. They all wish to help me to accept me as one of them, yet all I do is doubt. I do not
deserve such friendship. </p>

<p align=left>Solar Windstorm moved to the ornately carved wooden box at the head of the stone table
and with drew two jewel encrusted ceremonial daggers. He then circled around the table
to stand before his beautiful sibling Atlantia. He attempted to hand her one of the daggers
but she stopped him raising one delicately boned hand in front of his chest defiantly. </p>

<p align=left>"Solar, are you sure this will work?" She asked. </p>

<p align=left>The mage frowned and looked at the woman annoyed. He took a step closer coming into
contact with her icy touch. He stared straight into her jade green eyes and lowered his
voice as he spoke.</p>

<p align=left>"I have told you before sister, there are no guarantees. I know only this, the ritual worked
for me." He paused a moment then continued, trying to convey the urgency of the
situation. </p>

<p align=left>"Listen to me! Timing is critical. Every last drop of the revenant blood must leave his body
while the planets are aligned or all is for naught. This lunar spectacle occurs but once
every fifteen years. Now, either help me perform the task at hand or get out of my way.
We must make haste or the man has no chance at all."</p>

<p align=left>Atlantia lowered her head and turned her hand palm side up in reluctant acceptance. Solar
nodded with satisfaction and placed a dagger in her hand. The woman crossed to the
other side of the table and began to fasten the arm strap to Bentley's forearm. Solar
mirrored his sister's movements restraining the blonde man for his own safety. Solar
looked at the younger man's face and said. </p>

<p align=left>"I will not lie to you Bentley. The pain will be unbearable but it is necessary for the
purification."</p>

<p align=left>A look of fear clouded Bentley's blue eyes for a moment but was almost instantly replaced
by one of resolved determination. </p>

<p align=left>"I understand. Please proceed." He replied. </p>

<p align=left>The mage watched as Bentley set his jaw in grim readiness. Without another word Solar
glanced at his sister and nodded. The two siblings drew their blades along each of
Bentley's wrists in perfect unison just as the twin moons of Sosaria came into view.
Atlantia watched in horrid fascination as blue black blood spilled from the wounds and ran
down the table edge. </p>


<p align=left>Solar dropped the dagger and grabbed his spyglass observing the planetary motion. He
gasped as Trammell's edge passed in front of the Sun and Felucca did the same to
Trammell itself. The three orbs were slowly merging and becoming one. Bentley cried out
in shock as the sun's rays hit the escaped vitae. The blood began to smolder. Black
smoke rose from the table as the liquid evaporated from the blood grooves holding it. The
young man's cries quickly turned to screams of pain as the sun's filtered rays now fell
upon his body. He could feel the diseased blood in his veins begin to boil. It felt as though
he was on fire being consumed from the inside out. He screamed as the sun seared the
very blood circulating within his lungs. Bentley did not hear the screams for he was now
far beyond any sensation but that of pain. The pain ran through his body burning his soul
like acid. The young man flung open his eyes and stared uncomprehending at the
celestial bodies above him. He did not remember coming to the observatory in the city of
Moonglow. Nor did he remember agreeing to under go this insane experiment to cure him
of his affliction. He was unaware of anyone's presence in the room with him. In fact, he
was oblivious to his surroundings entirely. All he knew was the pain he felt and how he
wished for it to end. The sun now totally eclipsed by the two moons stared down at him
like some benevolent evil eye. This was the last thing Bentley saw before
unconsciousness mercifully found him and took him away from the pain. </p>

<p align=left>Solar Windstorm ignored the man on the table focusing on the cosmic event taking place
in the sky. The mage knew no other force in the universe could compare to the power of
the heavens. There was no doubt in the old man's mind that the galactic force would purify
the man as it had himself some fifteen years ago. The key was the blood. The tainted
blood must be completely burned away to allow the cosmic power to enter in and
generate new pure blood to fill him. All the bad blood must be gone before the moons
passed and the planets separated. For the first golden rays of the sun would bring with
them new life. </p>

<p align=left>Atlantia watched the blood flow closely as Solar had instructed. It had slowed to virtually
nothing now. One drop fell after several long seconds. Her head darted back and forth as
she looked from one wrist to the other. Not a drop had fallen from the right wrist in well
over a minute. She concentrated on the left and held her breath as a single drop welled up
from the wound like a black tear and rolled down the wrist with painstaking slowness. The
drop never reached the table before it was vaporized by smoke colored rays of sunlight.
Surely that is the last she thought. </p>

<p align=left>"That is it! No more time!" Solar shouted as he turned to look at his sister. "The moons
have begun the separation." </p>

<p align=left>The woman looked away from Bentley's wrist just as the last drop of blood in his body
seeped to the surface of the wound. The droplet rolled to the lip of the wound poking its
head out for an instant then shrank back into the vein refusing to exit. Atlantia glanced to
the wrist mouthing a silent pray that the blood flow had stopped. Indeed it had. </p>

<p align=left>As the sun's rays hit Bentley's face the man began to shimmer and glow with an Inner
Light. His skin sparkled and his golden hair glistened and gleamed with interstellar
energy. Atlantia raced to unfasten the restraints and laid her head upon his chest but
heard nothing. There was no heartbeat, no tell tale rise and fall of the chest as the man
took breath. Nothing. Atlantia glared at her brother in frustration. </p>

<p align=left>"He is dead!" She exclaimed. "You said this would cure him Solar and now he is truly
dead!" Atlantia moved towards her brother with super human speed, her hands
outstretched as if to strangle him. </p>

<p align=left>"Wait!" He said waving a hand to dismiss her anger. "Give the cosmos time to work. He
has been mostly dead his entire life it will take a few moments to revive him." </p>

<p align=left>Atlantia considered her brother's words and returned to the young man's side. She placed
two fingers upon his wrist above the wound. Well it was not actually a wound any longer
but a light pink scar. It seems the power cosmic had repaired the damaged limbs when it
invaded the young man's body. Atlantia searched the man's handsome face for any signs
of life. There was none. Just as the woman had given up hope of the young man's survival
his lips parted as he gasped taking in his first breath of air. Atlantia jumped back startled
then quickly regained her composure. </p>

<p align=left>"Bentley, Bentley my friend. Can you hear me?" The woman waited patiently for a reply. </p>

<p align=left>The man's eyelids fluttered sleepily then opened. His once pale blues eyes were now the
deep azure color of the sea. He smiled weakly at Atlantia then grasped her hand. Atlantia
returned the smile and spoke to him gently with a voice as soft as falling snow. </p>

<p align=left>"How do you feel?" She asked.</p>

<p align=left>Bentley swallowed hard choking back tears of joy. He slowly propped himself up on his
elbows and looked around the room with new eyes. He smiled brightly and his eyes shone
with hope. </p>

<p align=left>"Alive," he said. "I feel alive."</p>
