I wander through the swamps (near Spirituality desert) and provoke wisps on everything - kill a good 10-12 lizardmen in no time at all - for the hides.<br>Much of what I use provocation for is to distract the nastier monsters with tough but boring ones - say, ogres, trolls, etc. while I beat on the worst ones with a big stick.

This is how it should be.<p>A magic monster versus a melee monster of the same level range will win, for instance a gazer versus a lizardmen, similar melee strength, but the gazer can get off a few ebolts or even a flamestrike early in the battle. The battle will take a while, but the gazer eventually wins.<p>Magic monster versus similar magic monster is usually pretty short, one of them will get the upper hand with a flame strike or an ebolt.<p>Provocation is a very powerful skill, bordering on too powerful. With only 46 hit points and a mere 57 in provocation, 70 in archery, and 96 in Music, my Bard can take down and entire Orc War Party (6 Orcs, 2 Captains, 1 Lord, 1 Mage) by himself, and thats with wearing no armor.<p>The Bard skills still work just as well as ever.

Here's an example - 2 Ophid enforcers will fight for easily 10 mins. I can take one down with a fighter in 30 seconds. Are my skills superior to the Ophid? I'd say they are about equal. Why doesn't it take a player 10 mins to fight one then? What are the chances I'd even get credit for the kill when the nearest warrior or mage just comes along and whacks the monsters I provoke, gets the fame, gets the loot, etc? It happens all the time. People say I should become a GM warrior then.. but why? I'm a bard!! Why must everything come down to fighting skills? Geez.. even fishermen have to be fighters.... Unless you are a tamer... finny how those "tame" animals retain their strength and fighting skill as opposed to provoked monsters. If anything I would think an enraged monster would fight better than a domesticated one. Go figya...<p>Peacemake just plain sucks.. to say otherwise is ridiculous. Obviously this was done to prevent twinks training then peacemaking to kill people. Yet, people can pull the old invis trick. Where is the logic in nerfing bards when people can still do that sort of thing? Most bards do not even have it and are usually just GM warriors with some barding skill. <p>An orc party is not hard to take down for even a marginal warrior, so I don't see that as a great deal.
