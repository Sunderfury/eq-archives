<p align=left>Captain's Log: Wintersebb 6

<p align=left>Well I figure it was about time that the rain let up some so I could go out
and find the entrance to the Lytelthorpe Distillery.  Still it was a wee
hard to pull meself out of bed this morning, especailly seein' as there is a
defniate chill in the air today.  Still the call of some fine ancient
vintages is a strong one.</p>

<p align=left>So with that I picked up a small quiver of arrows, and donned me leather
armor and headed off south.  Just as the rumors I'd picked up said the
entrance was just south of town in a squat stone building of anchient age.
Just out side the building there was a pack of those annoyin' drudges.
There were only a couple of them, and me oak yumi made short work of them.</p>

<p align=left>I then progressed into the catacombs that were once the emperian's pride and
joy. (at least I should think they were).  The entrance was nothin' but a
stoney cave, but a short way in is what apears was the original entrance.
Here the walls are finished and the smell of putrid ale is everywhere.  Its
almost as if I was back in one of the older taverns in the world, 'cept fer
all the besties.</p>

<p align=left>In all seriousness I really need to travel with a larger quiver.  There were
drudges and shreths everywhere down here.  I soon found meself beating the
buggers back with me bow as if it was a staff.  I managed to get out in one
peice though. The real pisser is that I failed to find a drop of ale or wine
down there.  Still there is much that I failed to explore while I was down
there.</p>

<p align=left>Tomorrow I think I'll head back down there with a bigger quiver.
