<p align=left><b>Lost At Sea</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A tired messenger from Serpents Hold comes to the house of the architects bringing a sealed scroll.  The scroll looks tattered, and severely water damaged, although its text is still legible.  He then leaves the scroll on the door step and return from where he came looking as one who has be relieved of a great burden.   </p>

<p align=left>To whom ever should find this note, please deliver it to Lord Brimstone of the Lost Order of Akalabeth in Yew. </p>

<p align=left>My Lord Brimstone,</p>

<p align=left>I write this letter, in the hopes that it might find its way to your hands.  I fear it may never be read for the sea is vast and there is little chance that a message sealed in a bottle of YewBerry Wine could ever find its way to human hands.  But write it I must for it must be told lest the story die with me.   </p>

<p align=left>I awoke, face down in the sand, the tide lapping gently over my body.  Around me was strewn bits of wood looking all for the world as though they were bones.  Ominous storm clouds hovered overhead threatening to unleash the full fury of mother nature down upon me.</p>

<p align=left>Where am I?</p>

<p align=left>The tide was coming in now, the sea reluctant to give me back was trying to stretch out its hands and take me back.  Painfully I crawled up the beach and into the shelter of the islands forest.  I propped myself against a palm tree to take stock of the situation.</p>

<p align=left>My leg was broken, that much I was at least sure of.  I reached for my pouch of reagents, a minor healing would at least let me walk again.  Alas, in my pouch was not but my trusty dagger, my last birthday present from my father before his death.  I sighed, using my dagger I cut my now empty pouch into long strips.  Remembering what my mother did for me when I broke my arm as a lad, I used the strips of soft leather to affix a broken piece of lumber to my leg.  "This should do fer now" I thought to myself.  I leaned my head back against the tree behind me and looked skyward, trying to put the pain out of my mind</p>

<p align=left>How did I end up here?</p>

<p align=left>I sat there propped up against that tree for a time trying to remember.  T'wasn't the ale that clouded my thoughts last night, that I knew, but it was something more horrible than a wench from Buccaneer's Den.  I looked to my left at one of the many jagged broken pieces of wood, and the truth hit me like punch to the gullet.  Upon that broken splintered bit of wood was painted one word "Bloodwake".</p>

<p align=left>My mind was instantly filled with the horrible visages of the previous night, the scream of me and my crew and the horrible shrieking howl of the demonic monster that arose from the see.  In a panic I looked quickly around meself and then began to drag my lame carcass deeper into the jungle and away from the water.</p>

<p align=left>What in the name of the shard was that?</p>

<p align=left>That question lingered with me as I tried to calm myself and get back to the more important business of staying alive on this island.  I for a while I succeeded once again forgetting the previous night as I attempted to build a small shelter and gather some berries to eat.</p>

<p align=left>By nightfall I had fashioned myself a small shelter under a low bough of an ancient tree.  I had also managed to light a small fire and kill a small rabbit which I hungrily devoured.  I was sitting next to the fire trying my best to tend to injuries when the rain came.</p>

<p align=left>No not again!</p>

<p align=left>Terror raced through my mind as the thunder and rain began to fall.  I could not stop the flood of terror as the rain brought the memories of the previous night back to me in perfect clarity.  I tell ye the truth, I now know why my mind fergot it in the first place.  T'was a horrible visage that put me here, even as I pen this, my hands tremble at the thought of seeing it again.</p>

<p align=left>I was sailing the Bloodwake from Serpent's Hold the Everlight in preparation for the coming invasion of Golgatha when the weather took a turn fer the worse.  T'was the worst storm I had since since I slew that great serpent and nearly lost me ship.  My tillerman was worried a wee about the storm, knowin' my record.  Still though, I kept me ship pointed home I was not about to let a storm have the better of me.  I had reached the apex of the storm when the unimaginable happened.</p>

<p align=left>From the watery depths a horrible visage burst forth in a spray of seawater.  It look for all the world like a dragon, except this one looked at me with tattered wings, empty eye sockets  and rotting flesh.  Now I know that dragons be magical beasts, and of extreme intelligence, but I have never heard of a dragon defeating death and turnin' himself into a lich!     </p>

<p align=left>Before I could turn me ship about to attempt to avoid this monster, he lept from the water and came crashing down upon the bow of me ship.  With one swipe of its mighty claws me ships mast and sail we given to the sea.  Then it let out this demonic howl that still drives terror into me soul.  The foul monster then started walking towards me, his terrible claws shattering the deck, sending wooded shrapnel flying in every direction.</p>

<p align=left>Without thinking I drew my sword and charged at the beast, terror and anger equally driving me forward.  With two swift swings I managed to cleave a pair of large chunks of dragon flesh.  This action seemed to only annoy the foul undead beast, and with a single blow from the back of his claws he slammed me back against the tiller.  Momentarily stunned I watched in horror as the beast sent a flaming orb at my tillerman causing his body to detonate is a spray of red mist.     </p>

<p align=left>I tried to struggle to my feet and again charge at the beast, but I found that I could not maintain my balance (for as I later learned my left leg had been broken by the force of the beasts blow).  Upon seeing my vain efforts to rise and defend myself, the dragon lich stood upon his back legs and let out a great bellowing laugh.  T'was as hideous as the creatures howl.  The dragon lich then slammed his front claws back upon the deck of my ship, and did so with such force that the whole sea shook from it.  The Blookwake seemed to vibrate under the hideous monsters claws fer a moment and then without warning exploded in a hail of broken, splintered wood.</p>

<p align=left>Then next thing I knew I was face down on the beach.</p>

<p align=left>That's me tale, right now I'm searchin' this island fer a bit of garlic, ginseng and silk, tis all I need to walk again.  Once I can walk I can see about getting off of this rock and returning to me home.  Mayhaps ye shall get this letter before then, but once can never tell.</p>

<p align=left>Fair thee well Lord Brimstone may the shard guide our paths to cross again.</p>
