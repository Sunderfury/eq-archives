<p align=left><b>Captain's Log: Thistledown 22, 11 P.Y.</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I like Rithwic, I really do. The ale is good, the wenches friendly, and the shopkeepers honest. Tis a good town, but somehow I can never seem to keep meself there very long. Mayhaps it’s my lack of a steady income that does that, or mayhaps it is my wanderlust, and desire to return to the sea. Who knows? Still this morning I found myself debating on leaving town again and heading out. The problem was I didn't quite know where I wanted to go. That's when I received a message from a very scared lookin' young lass. Seems she'd been running all night to let me know that me ole mess mate and Patron Joxer the Mighty was using Cragstone as his staging grounds fer some rabble rousing.</p>

<p align=left>Well not wantin' to miss out of any of the action I decided I needed to head to Cragstone myself and join in the fray. After all I still owe Joxer a stout drink or two and all. With that I donned my studded leather armor and headed north to Cragstone. Now when I last made this journey I found the road clogged with banderlings and their swag. This time all I happened across, other than the occasional young banderlings was a couple of wings of red wasps.</p>

<p align=left>Now I don't like banderlings one bit, and I'm not sorry to see the road cleared of them, but something in that alarms me greatly. After all I was just hunting the buggers to the south of Rithwic not three days ago. It worries me that they have seemingly moved south as if migrating like birds away from something. I'm not one to scare easy by bar maid rumors and drunken' stories (after all I've told me fair share of them) but still, the rumors surrounding the cold weather we've been having and the movements of the banderling tribes has got me a mite scared.</p>

<p align=left>It was almost too easy to make my way north to Cragstone. Still I didn't let that daunt me much, since after all I was planning on meeting up with my brothers and sisters from the Lost Order of Akalabeth. Well I managed to get myself to Cragstone with little difficulty, and went about making myself at home, drinking at the Thorsten's Rest pub. I didn't have to wait long for me matey to show up, with a thirst fer a large mug of ale. With him was me ole matey Orion Red, Sunder, and Katana Moonblade. Seems they'd just gotten back from an eve patrolling the roads north and west of town.</p>

<p align=left>We chatted for a while on all the usual matters, which towns had the best ale, where the nearest nest of those pesky drudges was, and the movements of banderlings and shreth through the area. Talk also turned to the cold weather, and the rumors surrounding it. Still I won't let meself get too worries until some of the really nasty beasties from the north start traveling down in the populated areas. Then I will worry.</p>

<p align=left>After a little while Palehorse showed up. Now it seems like the whole bloody Akalabeth Fleet's gotten pulled into Dereth! Not that I'm complainin' mind ye, but I was hopin' to keep the secret of Glenden Wood's ale a little longer.</p>

<p align=left>As the day grew old around us we got ourselves well into the last keg of ale at the ‘Rest. Having filled ourselves on all but the very last drop of ale, Joxer Palehorse and I figured that we could do with a bit of a scrape around the area. I’m not quite sure exactly where we went after that, since the event of the night mixed with the ale, ‘ave befuddled me mind a bit.</p>

<p align=left>We headed out from Cragstone a short ways along the northwest road. A short way out of town we spotted a house on top of a near by hill. Something about that house bothered Palehorse so we hiked up the hill to take a look-see. We found the place besieged by a troop of young banderlings. With my bow, and Joxer and Palehorse’s steel we made short work of the young would be raiders, though not before they had killed the inhabitant of the house.</p>

<p align=left>These are certainly dangerous time we live in. I stopped to say a short prayer for the slain farmer before we moved on, trying to back track the banderlings and find the main body of their group. It didn’t take us long to find something, though it wasn’t what we were looking for.</p>

<p align=left>I came to at the Cragstone lifestone, rubbing my head and wondering what in the heck had happened. Then I remembered the shreth, and how all for of them with their 6 foot spikes had plowed me under without an effort. I grabbed my bow and started running for the scene of my untimely trip to the lifestone and found my friends in a pitched battle with the shreth over the items and I left behind. With bow, and steel we were able to finally beat back the hoards long enough to gather my belonging and get out of there.</p>

<p align=left>We still wanted to exact some revenge on the banderling tribes for the death of the farmer. Fortunately the trail was still fresh and our detour around the shreth didn’t cost us much time. Obviously the banderlings made no effort to cover their tracks as we found their camp rather quickly. Seems they were a large part of a small group of raiders that have been left behind by their tribe. Fortunately for the farmers around Cragstone, this raiding party won’t be bothering anyone any time soon.</p>

<p align=left>With a pack full of weapons collected from the banderling camp I decided to call it a day, and head back fer a bit of sleep at the ‘Rest.</p>
