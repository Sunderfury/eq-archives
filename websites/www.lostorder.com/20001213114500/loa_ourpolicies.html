    <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00">The Lost Order of Akalabeth's Mission
    Statement:</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#FEB36D">The Lost Order was founded with one
      purpose, to create a dynamic, multi-faceted guild which would allow its members to not
      only enjoy individual games, but to be united with other people with the same belief
      system. To say the Lost Order is a guild is to sell it short. Over the years we have
      progressed from our original roots within the world of Ultima Online to encompass multiple
      games, across multiple worlds, one thing however has remained the same, our loyalty to one
      another. The Lost Order is a family and like most families, we at times, have
      miscommunications or arguments, but the true strength of the guild, our ability to
      analyze, adapt and overcome has kept us united during any and all periods of discontent.
      It is imperative that any who seeks to become a member of the Lost Order realize that
      above all you must be loyal and respectful to your guildmates. It is our unity, which not
      only makes us strong, but also makes us strive.<br>
      <br>
      There are a certain set of regulations that are maintained throughout the various games,
      these regulations are not so much laws but a mixture of: common sense, professionalism,
      and ethical behavior. This includes but is not limited to: respect for any and all players
      and/or gaming staff, striving to increase the communities enjoyment of the game, an
      underlying sense of doing &#145;good&#146; deeds, the commitment to not resorting to
      exploitation of system flaws or third party &#145;cheats&#146; which would give you an
      unfair advantage, and above all a mature, guild orientated mindset.<br>
      <br>
      The Lost Order is a guild based on diversity in any term applied. We respect that each
      individual has a specific style of gaming; a specific genre of gaming, which he/she may
      enjoy and we strive to ensure each member, reaches maximum enjoyment. However, certain
      anti-social behaviors shall not be tolerated these include: racism, sexism, harassment, or
      game specific anti-social behavior (such as mindless Pking in the realm of UO). By living
      up to the afore mentioned standards we ensure that the Lost Order remains the most
      professional, most enjoyable guild in the virtual universe we all encompass.</font> </font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF8080"><strong>Each chapter of LOA may have
      additional policies/rules based on each game&#146;s specific mechanics. We strongly
      encourage you to read over this policy page (perhaps print it), then visit the chapter in
      which you seek to join. Review the specific chapter policies in depth before applying to
      the Lost Order of Akalabeth. If you have any questions about our policies whatsoever,
      please post to our public forums or contact our Councils, and you will receive a prompt
      answer from our members.</strong></font></p>

    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00"><b>Non Dual-Guild Affiliation:</b></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">If you seek to join LOA, you cannot
      retain membership in another guild.&nbsp; If you join LOA for our EverQuest or Shadowbane
      (Coming Soon) Chapter, you must then be involved with LOA for all other games that LOA is
      officially engaged in. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#00FF00"><strong>Exception
      to the rule: If the LOA does NOT offer an official presence in a game, we allow members to

    <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00">The Meeting Place:</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">Though each game&#146;s mechanics are
      different, one thing remains the same; the need for the Lost Order to remain unified. In
      order to achieve this, each game will be required, if possible, to designate a specific IG
      meeting place. This place shall for the most part be considered the base of operation.
      Here is were the guild members shall meet to discuss in game events, share adventures, and
      most importantly; maintain the close family structure that has aided us in developing.
      (E.g.: UO has the Village of the Lost, AC has Cragstone, EQ doesn&#146;t easily support
      this, so it has no static IG meeting place, but instead a rotating meeting place.) As we
      expand further into the online universe our primary goal upon entering, a new world will
      be to determine a centralized starting point. This may change as time progresses and our
      knowledge and/or game mechanics force us to relocate, however; there will always be a
      specific &#145;Chapter Agreed Upon&#146; base.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Participation:</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">The Lost Order has long been known for
      its affiliation and contributions to the online gaming world. We wish to keep this so. The
      only way to accomplish this task is by member participation. We expect that all members
      will be active participants not only in within the guild but within the community. This
      does not mean we expect to see you logged in to your specific game thirty-five hours a
      week. On the contrary, we realize that real life often throws each of us a curve from time
      to time. If you cannot be active on an in-game basis, we expect for you to at least remain
      active via the message boards, the mailing lists, or in some other form of guild approved
      involvement. It is requested that if you require some time away from the online world in
      general you inform someone of your hiatus. During this time, you will be placed into an
      in-active status until you once again return to your online family. Again, we shall never
      penalize anyone for issues that occur in real life. As a family, we expect you to take
      care of the issues that arise and while doing so know that we remain here always, ready to
      aid you in any way we can.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Trust Tax:</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">Regardless of which game or which
      combination of games you play, there will come a time when you have amassed more equipment
      then necessary. It is requested that any items, materials, etc that you may acquire in
      excess you donate to the guild. We do not enforce a weekly or monthly tax nor do we expect
      everyone to be able to give. It is suggested however that you help when possible. Your
      donations help new members and allow the guild to grow.</font></p>

    <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Becoming an Initiate:</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">Before you become an initiate into the
      Order, we require certain criteria to be met. The first of these is to fill out the
      appropriate chapter application. This application will be reviewed by those responsible
      for chapter recruiting. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#00FF00"><strong>We
      urge you to take time when completing your application.</strong></font><font
      face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D"> This is your first impression upon the guild.
      Often times people blow through these forms thinking it a mere formality. Such is not the
      case, each application is sent to the <strong>chapter mailing list to be reviewed by all
      the members.</strong> Input is taken from personal meetings and the information you
      supply. Thusly, those that take the time to answer our questions completely find a faster
      and more enjoyable route to becoming a member. During the time of application review, we
      urge you to meet us in our IRC channel (explained below in the how to use IRC section) and
      get to know our members. During this period, we also expect to see you around our central
      area or grouped with members often so we can get a feel for your play style. </font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">Once you are accepted into our family,
      many things will take place. You will be added to our mailing lists, and granted private
      access to our discussion forums.</font></p>

    <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Looting Policy:</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">Each chapter has specific rules regarding
      looting of creatures and &#145;others&#146; killed in groups. The theory behind all the
      policies however is the same. <strong>Be fair.</strong> We realize everyone wants the
      ultimate weapon or the indestructible armor, or the billion gold pieces. We don&#146;t
      wish to hinder your desire for wealth or power, we just ask that you are fair with those
      who participated, <em>even if they are from outside the guild.</em></font></p>

    <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Using Internet Relay Chat (IRC):</b> </font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">It is suggested when possible that you
      log into IRC and chat with those members who happen to be on during the same hours as you.
      This will give you a chance to speak with other members, learn about changes, and increase
      your relationships with one another.<br>

      emergency meetings, we have a private moderated room setup named, <strong>#Hall_of_Akalabeth</strong>.
      While in this room you must be <em>granted permission to speak on a topic</em>, this helps
      minimize channel traffic. ANY member can approach the podium and voice their thoughts,
      concerns, opinions, etc. </font></p>

    <b><p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00">Using ICQ:</font></b></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">Most of our Guild members have ICQ. We
      ask that when you become a member, you add those within the guild whom you associate with
      to your contact list as well as the High and Grand Council members. This way, we can all
      communicate with each other and have a better chance of knowing who from the guild is
      online. ICQ can be found at <strong><a href="http://www.mirabilis.com">http://www.mirabilis.com</a></strong>
      and is currently a free download and service. This tool is NOT required for LOA
      membership. It is simply recommended by our guild.</font></p>

      face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D"> which lasts up to one hour. The meetings are held
      in IRC in the private meeting room. Meeting logs are distributed via the CORE guild list,
      please review the log, particularly if you were unable to attend the meeting. We invite
      you to comment on anything brought up in the meeting log to a leader or to the CORE list.<br>
      <br>
      If you have topics or ideas that you would like to see discussed in our meetings, send
      them to the Council via the guild &quot;Council&quot; mailing list.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes Freejack or Brimstone are not able to make it, when this happens, a senior
      member will be asked to host the meeting. Over the last year, Freejack has been the
      primary host of our guild meetings. Brimstone, due to changes in his &quot;RL&quot;, has
      had to step away from hosting guild meetings and events.</font></p>

      alive, I am doing well... see you later!&quot;. If we go a year or so without
