<p align=left><b>Journal - Day Four</b><br><i>by Wysll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Father is alive.</p>

<p align=left>Those three words have made a jumbles out of my ordered life. I must get my center back...I can barely summon the clarity to properly intone the words to O'Kiel's Radiation. Useah would be cross with me, I'm sure...</p>

<p align=left>The day started normally enough...if you can call being in Rivervale normal. We started out in the inn. We've grown pretty used to having each other near, these past few days. After such a long time without them, the sight of my brothers around me in the morning warms my heart. We joked a bit, and Wyndelle said something suitably obnoxious that I had to slap him with a trout. (Fishing, while boring, does have it's advantages...)</p>

<p align=left>When we were all assembled, we decided to look around for evidence of father. After some debate, we decided to look somewhere outside the city. Father had evidently lived here some time without attracting too much attention.</p>

<p align=left>We looked in several halfling 'houses' (Why do they call them that? It's not like they're the abominations the humans live in... they're proper burrows, underground as Brell intended folk to live) without much success. I spied one a long way away from the rest, so Wyxle ran ahead of us to check it out.</p>

<p align=left>He didn't come back right away, so I entered the house to see if he had found anything... and I fell speechless. Our father was alive! - Tears of joy streamed down my face as we crowded around him, exchanging long overdue hugs of love and respect.</p>

<p align=left>As old as father seemed to us, what a sight we must have been to him! When he last saw us, we were little, barely older than infants.</p>

<p align=left>When the greetings finally ended, and we all settled down to a bit of black bread, Wyll told father of our quest, and the prophecy at the center of it all. Father couldn't help us with a lot of the prophecy - but he did say that the line about "The mother's blood runs true and pure in a bed of sorrow" reminded him of our mother.</p>

<p align=left>Slowly, amidst many exclamations, the story came out. Our mother, Daillia, was a member of the Darkmor family. (I still can't believe it - that family is a pox on the hindquarters of Ak'Anon. How our mother came from that stock...) Father said that she was in balance between the evil of that family, and the good that most gnomes follow.</p>

<p align=left>Uncle Wyndsor had fallen in love with her. But all his love for her and Brell could not turn her to the Light. When she fell in love with father, and her love for him did what Uncle Wyndsor could not - our uncle became the embittered old gnome we saw a few days ago.</p>

<p align=left>When our mother was murdered... even now, hours after hearing of these events, tears well up in me at the thought - father had to leave Ak'Anon. Not having anywhere else to turn, he gave my brothers and I over to his brother's care. Uncle Wyndsor.</p>

<p align=left>Most of my life, I have believed father dead - words I heard from my uncle. Now, from my father's own lips I hear that Uncle Wyndsor knew the truth - and told us the lie we have lived with for many a year.</p>

<p align=left>As joyous as the occasion was, we still had the prophecy to unravel. Before we left, father reassured us that he would always be there, waiting for us. He passed around vials of liquid, an elixir of which I have never seen the like. He bade us drink it, saying that with this enchanted water he would be able to contact us wherever we may roam on Norrath. It took some of the sting out of our parting.</p>

<p align=left>I despaired over the long boat ride home - until a halfling named Timbo Silvermist agreed to teleport us all to the Butcherblock mountains. Anything to avoid the boat - we eagerly accepted his kind offer.</p>

<p align=left>So, here I am in familiar land, under the watch of the ancient druid stones. This day has seen joy unmatched in my brief life...and anger untempered by the passage of time. Uncle Wyndsor has much to answer for...</p>
