<p align=left><b>Advice on Women</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>“Blimey,” said one of the sailors. “Jake, have a look at that bloke over thar in the corner.”</p>

<p align=left>“The one at the table?”</p>

<p align=left>“Naw, the one what’s sittin’ all by ‘imself at the bar. That’s ol’ Santiago, ain’t it?”</p>

<p align=left>“Blimey! So it is. Let’s go over an’ say ‘ello, eh?”</p>

<p align=left>The two crewmen got up and strolled over toward the solitary sailor. Santiago didn’t notice them at first. With his jaw resting on his hand, he stared absently at the label on the bottle in front of him.</p>

<p align=left>“Ahoy, matey!” cried Jake, clapping Santiago on the shoulder. Santiago looked up, and a wide grin replaced his somber frown.</p>

<p align=left>“Well bless yer hearts, lads, how are ye?”</p>

<p align=left>“Ah, well enough. Just got shore leave fer the night, an’ figgered we’d see if thar was a tavern about.” He leaned closer and lowered his voice. “We heard this was a good place to find wenches at.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago grinned ruefully. “Well, aye, it can be. But be real careful what ye wish fer!”</p>

<p align=left>“Say…ye been around a bit, ain’t ye? Got any advice fer us young fellas?”</p>

<p align=left>“Well, lads, ye come to the right bloke,” said Santiago. “It just so happens that I be an expert on the subject o’ women.”</p>

<p align=left>The sailors leaned closer, eager to benefit from Santiago’s great wisdom. They attentively listened to every word, every morsel of information about the greatest mystery of all time.</p>

<p align=left>“Well, first off, the best way to win a lady’s heart is to buy her things. Thar ain’t nothin’ a lady appreciates more than bleedin’ the gold out of a fella. She ain’t happy ‘less thar’s gold ‘round her neck, ‘round her arms, ‘round her fingers. It ain’t enough just to hand her yer gold, though that’s what it boils down to. Ye have to buy her things; that way it’s called gifts rather than robbery.”</p>

<p align=left>“Second rule: Don’t be yerself. If ye want a lady to like ye, ye can’t act like ye usually act. Ye can’t swear, nor curse, nor spit, nor belch, nor break wind, nor get drunk. Ye can’t laugh at dirty jokes, an’ ye can’t look at other women. Ye have to act upset if thar’s a dead animal, an’ ye have to act as if ye like poems. Ye have to act kind an’ gentle an’ sensitive an’ compassionate an’ polite an’ courteous. Basic’lly, ye can’t act like yer a man.”</p>

<p align=left>“Third way to a lady’s heart is by sayin’ nice things to her. Even if they ain’t true. Tell her she looks perty. Tell her ye like what she’s wearin’. But ye have to do it all fancy-like. Ye can’t just go up to a lady an’ say she looks good. Ye have to say she looks like golden sunlight, or somethin’ silly like that.”</p>

<p align=left>The crewmen looked a bit confused. “In case ye ain’t noticed, we ain’t exactly gentlemen, matey. We ain’t no good at fancy words.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago shook his head. “Naw, it ain’t that hard. Watch this.”</p>

<p align=left>A tall, elegant woman clad in form-fitting plate mail had just entered the tavern. The metal sloped down toward her hips in a “V” shape, leaving her sides exposed. Santiago doubted the armor would protect her very well in battle, but it was sure pleasant to look at!</p>

<p align=left>Santiago swaggered toward her and bowed clumsily. “Ahoy, milady! Me name’s Santiago. What’s yers?”</p>

<p align=left>“Ilina,” she said coldly, and then slapped him in the face.</p>

<p align=left>The two sailors looked confused. Santiago was supposed to be an expert on women. Why, then, was he now lying on the floor?</p>

<p align=left>After a few minutes, Santiago regained consciousness. He winced as he sat up and rubbed his jaw. He had been slapped many, many times before…but somehow it hurt much worse when the lady wore a plate-mail gauntlet.</p>

<p align=left>Ilina was still standing above him, her face contorted in an angry scowl. “Why did you refuse Lacey’s love?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago blinked. “I din’t refuse her love, milady.”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, you did.”</p>

<p align=left>“Beggin’ yer pardon, milady, no I din’t.”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, you did.”</p>

<p align=left>“Beggin’ yer pardon again, milady, but ye weren’t thar.”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, I was.”</p>

<p align=left>“No, ye weren’t.”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, I was.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago sighed. “If ye were thar, milady, ye’d know what I said.”</p>

<p align=left>“You said you did not love her.”</p>

<p align=left>“Well, that’s close, but it ain’t quite the truth. I din’t never say that. I said I was afeared I mought break her heart some day.”</p>

<p align=left>“Just another way of saying it,” she growled. “Just another line, just another goddamn line!” She turned and stormed out of the tavern without another word.</p>

<p align=left>Santiago sighed and pulled himself up and glanced toward the two crewmen, who stared at him in confusion.</p>

<p align=left>“Rule number four, mateys,” said Santiago. “Don’t fall in love…not ever. It only leads to hurt.” He grabbed his bottle of beer and moved toward the door.</p>

<p align=left>“Ye lads take care o’ yerselves,” he said. “I wish ye luck, an’ hope that we’ll meet again some day. But for now, I’m off to the Abbey. Thar’s somethin’ I gotta do.”</p>
