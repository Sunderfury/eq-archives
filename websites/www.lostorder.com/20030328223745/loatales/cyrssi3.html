<p align=left><b>Day Three</b><br><i>by Cyrssi</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Dear Elandel,</p>

<p align=left>I hope you are faring well. Today, with a little luck and a lot of help from Tunare, I reached my 17th season! I wish you could have been there. Many lions and crawlers gave their lives this day. Shortly afterwards, a nasty hound attacked me, a a friend of his joined in. I was knocked unconscious for a little while, but something drove them off and I recovered.</p>

<p align=left>While I was healing up I taught myself how to make silk swatches for tailoring from the spider silk I had collected during my travels. I have quite a bit of it now, and mayhaps I shall take up the craft in the near future. I certainly have the patience for it, and from what I've seen it shouldn't be too difficult to get a start in. I would offer to make ye some armor or clothing, but I imagine you will have grown considerably by the time you read this. </p>

<p align=left>I think I shall stay in the eastern part of the Karanas for a little while longer. I found a few nice hunting places, and for the first time since our brief trip to Everfrost, I saw the grand bridge that leads to the northern part of the Karanas. A great spectacle it was with the setting sun behind it. You would have loved it.</p>

<p align=left>I talked with Uncle Aanlain today. He was thrilled that I was another season closer to my naming ceremony. He agreed that I should remain here a bit before exploring other places. He also told of some quite wonderful news! It seems we are to soon have an Aunt! He has asked the fair Azra, a human druid, for her hand. She has accepted, although the date and time of the marriage is yet unannounced. I have already been commissioned to make the vodka, and I imagine that I will have much for everyone to enjoy. I will be sure to write all about it if the event passes before we see each other again.</p>

<p align=left>I hope that this Azra woman is all Uncle says she is. I wouldn't want his heart broken again, as it was when I told him of your disappearance. I couldn't stand to see him like that, and I don't know if the "old man" could take it. Well, it's off to bed for me. I wish you well. Every night I fall asleep hoping that I will awake the next day to find you home again. Mayhaps tomorrow will be that day.</p>

<p align=left>Goodnight, brother.</p>
