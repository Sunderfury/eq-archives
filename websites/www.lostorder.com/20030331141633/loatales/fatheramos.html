<p align=left><b>Father Amos</b><br><i>by Mary</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>"I'm off to play in the meadow, Momma," Mary exclaimed, snatching her flower basket and hurrying out the cottage door. </p>

<p align=left>"Stay in the meadow, Mary!" The girl could hear her mother caution, as the door closed. "Stay out of the woods, and away from those pesky sprites!" She said firmly. </p>

<p align=left>"Yes, Momma!" Mary yelled to the open window, as she scurried past. </p>

<p align=left>It was such a delightful day-the air seemed filled with magic. Golden rays warmed the Sylvan glade, and a slight breeze caressed the sea of wild flowers in rippling waves of color and life. Mary danced up the path, plucking her favorite blossoms and placing them into her basket along the way. She hummed to herself, glancing about in anticipation of seeing her new friend-the one she had met here the day before. As she neared the edge of the clearing Mary could see several large birds flapping about; she rushed towards them and her heart skipped with glee when she caught a glimpse of her friend, standing beneath a tree. </p>

<p align=left>"Father Amos!" Mary cheered with excitement.</p>

<p align=left>"Shew! Shew! Be off with thee, feathered fiends!" Father Amos warned, swatting at several of the birds that were bothering him under the tree. He turned to smile as Mary approached.</p>

<p align=left>"Good morning, dear childe!" Father Amos said with a chuckle.</p>

<p align=left>Mary jumped up and down, startling the birds. "Go away. Shew! Shew!" She cried, mimicking Father Amos. The birds scattered in all directions, disappearing out of sight.</p>

<p align=left>"This was the perfect place for a nice little nap until those feather-brains awoke me." Father Amos said, with just a hint of disgust. Then he laughed. "How do ye fare this fine 'morn, sweet Mary?"</p>

<p align=left>"I'm fine sir," Mary said respectfully. Eyes brightening, she could not contain her excitement. "I'm picking wild flowers, see?" Mary showed him the basket filled with the gifts of Mother Nature, pointing out each one in turn. "This is a daisy…this is a buttercup…this one is a dand..er..lion…and this one…" She continued to identify each blossom in the basket with expertise. "Mr. Cal Man gave me a book with pictures of all the flowers in it." Mary explained happily. </p>

<p align=left>"Ahh, they are all quite beautiful, dear Mary. All reflections of the beauty in your soul." Said Father Amos profoundly.</p>

<p align=left>"I'm so glad you were here again today, Mr..er…I mean Father Amos," said Mary. "I forgot to ask you sumfin' yeserday," Mary looked perplexed and Father Amos adopted a more serious expression.</p>

<p align=left>"Well then, what troubles thee, childe?" he asked sincerely. Mary paused for a moment in thought.</p>

<p align=left>"What do you wonder about?" Mary asked, puzzled.</p>

<p align=left>Father Amos pondered this odd question, replying. "I wonder about many of life's mysteries, childe, but I am not sure that I understand what you mean. Why do you ask such a question, Mary?" He inquired.</p>

<p align=left>"Well, yeserday you told me you was a wondering healer." Mary explained. "But you never told me what you wonders about." </p>

<p align=left>Father Amos laughed out loud. Mary did not understand his reaction or why he patted her head in such a consoling fashion. "It was a slight misunderstanding, Mary. I told you that I am a wandering healer, not a wondering healer." He said in a mild manner so as not to hurt her feelings. "You see dear, I have taken an oath to help all those in need, and I wander across the land traveling to where people need me the most." </p>

<p align=left>Mary's eyes widened. "I see!" She laughed. "Me not too smart sumtimes. Me thought you said wonder." Mary inquired further, "How do you's help people?"</p>

<p align=left>Father Amos showed Mary his backpack, which was filled with bandages and herbs of all sorts. "I have the gift of healing," Father Amos explained. "I use these to keep wounded people alive-sometimes brining them back from the jaws of death itself."</p>

<p align=left>"Oh my!" Mary's eyes widened even further. Then Mary noticed Father Amos' finger, which still bore a mark from when he pricked it the day before. "Why you finger still sore?" Mary asked concerned. "Can't you fix it?" Mary looked puzzled once again. </p>

<p align=left>"Nay, I cannot," said Father Amos, searching for words Mary would understand. "You see, when I gave my vows and dedicated my life for the healing of others, I renounced…uh…lost…the ability to heal myself. It is rather difficult to explain."</p>

<p align=left>Mary looked upset. "I soooo sorry you hurted youself yeserday. I have a better basket today, with no sp'inters!" Mary sat her basket of wildflowers down beside Father Amos. "See… this is a pretty basket. No more sp'inters here." Mary rubbed the side of the woven basket. "I was pickin' these for you and brought this bestest basket for you to keep." </p>

<p align=left>Father Amos gave her a light hug. "Its ok, Mary. I am fine now. Thou art such a sweet, caring childe! Thank you so much for this wonderful gift."</p>

<p align=left>Mary started admiring the items in the healer's backpack once again, with deep curiosity. Suddenly, she looked at Father Amos adoringly. "When I grow up, I want to be a wanderin' healer and help peoples, just like you, Father Amos." Mary said proudly. 
Father Amos smiled at Mary warmly. "It is a hard but rewarding life, dear Mary." The healer responded. "The most difficult part is seeing so much death and bloodshed in the world, but with the healer always comes hope."</p>

<p align=left>Mary's eyes grew wide with fear. "That's scary. Me never see'd a dead peoples afore." Mary gasped. </p>

<p align=left>"You have nothing to fear from the dead, sweet childe. They are only at rest, and with the healer's help, sometimes they can be awakened." Father Amos comforted Mary once more. "You have a special gift, Mary, and I think that you will make and excellent wandering healer some day." </p>

<p align=left>Much relieved, "Yep, yep. I will be's the bestest healer ever…um…'cept for you Father Amos." Mary gave the cleric another quick hug. "I gotta go now, Father." Mary said excitedly. "I want to get started helping peoples."</p>

<p align=left>"Be safe, sweet Mary. Thank you again for the beautiful flower basket." Said Father Amos fondly. Mary slung the backpack over her shoulder, and trotted off down the path towards the clearing, waving as she crossed the meadow. </p>

<p align=left>Once the girl was out of sight, the vultures quickly returned to continue their feast. Even though Father Amos' corpse was in the second day of decay, there was still several good meals left for the hungry scavengers. The birds fought furiously over the remains, toppling over the flower basket. Blood stained petals wilted and fell gently to the ground, as a dark shadow rose from the woods-echoing laughter, with an almost human air about it. </p>

<p align=left>Skipping happily, Mary entered the Akalabethian clearing, still humming to herself. Then, near the fountain she caught site of the now so familiar red hair and broke into an excited run. </p>

<p align=left>"MR. RED MAN!" Mary shrieked gleefully. </p>

<p align=left>Sir Galventine turned, smiling at the sound of her voice and opened his arms wide in his usual greeting stance. Mary bounced up to meet him, knowing full well what came next. Laughing hysterically she jumped into his waiting arms. Sir Galventine hoisted the girl up effortlessly and swung her around in wide sweeping circles, before once again setting her gently on the ground. "Weeeeeeeeeee!" The child exclaimed.</p>

<p align=left>Once on her feet again Mary unslung the backpack from her shoulder and announced with satisfaction. "I'm gonna be a wonderin' healer like Father Amos!"</p>

<p align=left>Galventine looked at the healer's pack, filled with bandages and felt a twinge of terror touch his very soul, though he forced the smile to remain on his face. </p>

<p align=left>"That is nice Mary, but I would like to hear more about Father Amos. Come, princess, we can play 'follow the leader' to the Brewman and you can tell me all about what you did today." Galventine caressed the girl's face gently once, before duck walking towards the tavern for their talk.</p>
