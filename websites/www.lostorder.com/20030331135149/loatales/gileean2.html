<blockquote>
<p align=left>Well my friend today is another day in your life as a Wanderer. You know you love it. Well today marked more than enough adventure in most of your past years. </p>

<p align=left>Knowing I was coming up upon my 30th Birthday in a few days I wanted to make the last of my 20's worth something. but I knew much of what I had learned these past few years. Staying in one place for once has helped strengthen me. Slow and Steady slaying the local Dogmen. Yes it has been kind to me in many reguards, but sadening at the same time. For I longed to travel.</p>

<p align=left>While chatting away with some of the local hunters and pummeling of the Dogmen, I recieved a message from one of the many Messengers of the lands of Norrath. It asked me to make haste and get to the Northern reigions of the Karana's. I was to meet Gonandar Greatwolf and Nornric the Cleric. I for sure was not sure entierly what for but went on a hunch, and desire to see some new scenery.</p>

<p align=left>I bid my farewells to my newly aquainted friends and made haste to the Druid ring in the Northern Karana's. Now as the Gods would have it, in my long since stay in Southern Karana, I had let slip the way from memory. I stopped for a moment to get my bearings, when something amazing happened. I spotted GrimFeather off in the distance! That feathery freak had done me in too many times to count. Nah not this time...I was ready. Full o'arrows and fleet of foot. I snuck up behind him and let loose. Ahhh he started looking like a pincushion. Then something terribly wrong happened...I noticed he was gaining ever faster upon me. Not again, but wait! I little guy came rushing past me in my hasty retreat and saves my sorry behind. The little Halfling saved my hide and turned around and handed me the Rune I had been after from Ol' Grim.</p>

<p align=left>Yes today was already looking up.</p>

<p align=left>After a few moments of idle chatter Gonandar and Nornric found me and told me to hang on for the ride. I always did like that magical porting stuff. When we arrived near the lands of Trolls, Ferrot, we quickly headed towards Cazic Thule. We had Gonandar, Nornric, Azra, Jediit, Dukot, and well not sure I can remember the others as the day was Fast and Furious with adventure and action, but alas they all had a share in the fun. After arriving outside we sat to gather our wits and prepare. </p>

<p align=left>We headed inside and Gonandar led us on a tour of the Lizard Men homeland. All was well for the most part of the tour. Rather insightful it was. But we ended up in a bit of a pickle when one of the Lizard Men spoted Jediit on our way out. Needless to say he called his friends and it turned into an all out battle frenzy. Lives were lost but we regrouped and things went back to normal. So we went back in and Gonandar, Nornric, and I took watch over the younger ones while they took a crack at the Aligators in the sewers.</p>

<p align=left>A few hours later the young ones got restless and decided they were going to head of to thier favored hunting grounds of Runny Eye. I decided I would return to South Karana to hunt with friends in the area and once again be in hopes of aquiring those Split Paw gloves.</p>

<p align=left>After returning to South Karana and finding a few friends we took up our regular camp outside Split Paw and went about our usual business. At one point a lovely Barbarian woman came by peddling a interesting ring. I asked to look at it and suddenly realized what it was. A Ring of the Goblin Lords!!!! I asked her what her price was. She told me 170 platinum, but I could only afford 150. After a few moments of haglging the deal was sealed at 150 platinum. I knew very well its worth was much greater. A good deal it surely was.</p>

<p align=left>I returned to my friends and the hunt. Much time went past with nothing exciting and figured my day would end on that note. I adventurous day and profitable, but still hungering for more. I didn't need wait long for Dessert to come along.</p>

<p align=left>A few of my partners had gone off to town for an early nights rest and we bid adiue. All was left was Lamaril, Warbear, and myself. While waiting for some of the Dogmen to emerge from thier cave I decided to see if I could track anything to take away the boredom.
Then there he was.....Quillmane. I scrambled in the direction of his essence and soon saw him on the horizon. OH MY was he beautiful!!!! Such a splendid creature. I almost felt saddened to slay the gorgeous beast. I took aim and fired an arrow...bullseye! a mortal wound I gave him. Right in his neck. I then turned and ran towards my friends for help as I knew Quillmane would be too much for me alone. Lamaril was on the ready with a heal and Warbear standing ready for battle. I soon reached the camp and we ensued the fight. the healing arts of the druid were splendid but did not seem great enough to the damage this magnificent beast inflicted. I nearly lost my life but quickly drew upon my own healing for a breath of life. But Warbear..oh Warbear. He fought Valiantly and with the heart of a man on fire....he perished as I dealt the killing blow to Quillmane and watched him fall from the sky. I wept...for both Warbear and Quillmane.</p>

<p align=left>I sat down to ponder the battle while Lamaril consoled me and healed me. I knew I could never recover from Warbear's death at my own greed if you would call it that. But I knew things must go on. I sauntered over to Quillmane's lifeless body and stared...such beauty. I knew I had to make his memory worthwhie as well and began stripping him of his magical feathers and hide. I fashioned a cloak from the legendary stories told of a Pegasi hide allowing levitation. And by the Gods...it worked. I can fly.</p>

<p align=left>An hour later Warbear had come to life again and we spoke. He was not angered at his death. But was rather happy about the whole days fun of friends and action. So ther it was. I full and unwasted day. Yes my friend today was a great day.</p>
