<p align=left><b>Jared's Dear John Letter</b><br><i>by Sally</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Jared my once love, I am not sure how to tell you this but after chasing you for several months it appears that you do not wish to be my love. I am not broken hearted at all. In fact I have found another love to take your place…he is older and treats me better than I have ever been treated before in my entire life.</p>

<p align=left>*smiles*</p>

<p align=left>I will start to tell you how I met this wonderful man of mine. You remember the last time I wrote to you how I told you about that very nice Lady Tara who told me about Sir William needed a new housekeeper. Well right after I got my letter of recommendation from Stubby I ran to his house. Sir William answered the door wearing his armor…and Jared I thought my heart has stopped…I have never seen such a handsome man in my life…I almost could not speak. He smiled at me and asked my what I wanted…all I could do was blush madly and hand him Sir Stubby’s letter.</p>

<p align=left>Sir William took the letter and read it and smiled back at me. He said he would be honored to help me turn my life around and to live my life by ways of the virtues. He asked me to step in and then he showed me around his grand home. I asked him if there was a Mrs. Sir William and he told me that she had died some time ago. After my tour of his home he wanted to know what type of work I have done before. I spent the next two hours telling him of my adventures trying to become a proper lady for you Jared. It was about that time when Sir William asked me where I lived so I told him how nice Officer Noci has been to allow me to live in the fleet house with the sailors. Sir William said that was not a proper place for a lady and told me I could move into his servant quarters. To my surprise he even helped me move…now that is a real gentleman…not to mention I did enjoy seeing him flex those wonderful muscles helping me move.</p>

<p align=left>Well wish me luck Jared…I shall start being Sir William’s housekeeper tomorrow and who knows what I may end up being soon. I do hope that we can still be friends Jared. Just think if it weren’t for that nice Lady Tara I would have never met my new love of my life Sir William.</p>
