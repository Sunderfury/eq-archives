: Doth Dr. Cat mean anything to thee?
: O boy! It is Ultima you say!
: Yes, yes and yes again thou art right, but take a look at this.

: O my fellow bards to think that such a Bartle-thing could start all these fantastic discoveries!
: I feel as if I had been born anew.
: My friends, I tell ye: Life is beautiful.

: I think I will consider it a little while yet, but everything says go!
: Worry not I would tell ye before leaving for distant shores for good.
: The orb of the moons should not be impossible to find now.
: Indeed the net is huge and the waves are high but there is sand like velvet on the buttom of it all.

: It is on a day like this that you just love the whole world.

: Today I am alive again.
: Today the blue moongate did open.
: Today I will find the City of Dawn.
: Today I shall rest in the arms of Katrina
: Today I will build that house in Cove, which I have always dreamt of. 

: Today I have awoken.
: Today I am alive again,
: for I have been sleeping for a thousand years.

: Yours sincerely,
: Bobo (the other one)
