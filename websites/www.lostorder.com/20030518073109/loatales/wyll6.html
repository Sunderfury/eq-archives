<p align=left><b>Journal - Day Six</b><br><i>by Wyll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>What have we gotten ourselves into...</p>

<p align=left>I took a walk this morning to think about the events of the last few days, and I must say, there is a great deal to think about. After walking back to the gates of Ak'anon to meet up with my brothers we decided to set out for the docks and catch a boat to Antonica. It seems we have business with this Lady Darkmor.</p>

<p align=left>On our way through Steamfont, though, a very strange person approached us. A human, actually, a human with some rather bizarre mannerisms. She was going on about some gnome girl that was being held captive the orc slavers in Crushbone and how we really should save her. She even said that this girl looked like us...it's funny how these things don't surprise me as much anymore. After gathering Wyloon and Wyndelle, who had run ahead of the rest of us, we let them in on what we had been told and that we would be making a detour to dreaded orc city of Crushbone.</p>

<p align=left>Meeting up with Yabbernox from the Order was a pleasure, he's nice enough as dwarves go, but naturally, he couldn't resist the short jokes...I don't know where he gets off with that stuff, put him next to any tall one and he isn't much better off.</p>

<p align=left>The jog to Crushbone was thankfully uneventful and we were greeted by quite a surprise upon reaching the entrance to the orc city. The barbarian woman Azlana was also in the area and agreed to assist us in our search for this gnome girl. We were quite thankful for the help, the orcs can be quite viscious at times. With that, the party forged into the orc realm.</p>

<p align=left>Naturally, we weren't the only ones questing into Crushbone, the place was filled with other adventurers looking to rid the world of the orc plague, understandably, we weren't in much danger from those few orcs that escaped the blade of those around us. We searched for quite a while looking into the slaver huts and in the mines. Strangely enough, the slaves in the mines started to attack us...all I can think is, the orc slavers had brainwashed these poor fools to think gnomes were their enemies! Bah, but what is the world coming to... While in the mines it seemed our brother Wyndelle vanished from sight. Though we were assured he was not in danger from the orcs, I can only hope that stronger magics didn't take him from us...I don't like the prospect of having to search across the world to find my brothers.</p>

<p align=left>Leaving the mines we came upon an encampment of tents and small huts. Searching this area in detail we didn't find anything. As we finished the search there, a couple orcs set upon us, no real threat, but it distracted us. After dispatching the pitiful pair, we turned around to find a gnome girl huddling in hut...a hut I swear we had searched just moments ago!</p>

<p align=left>She seemed to be dazed, perhaps from her imprisonment, though I didn't see any visible sign of trauma on her body (no, I didn't examine THAT closely). To my eyes, she seemed just fine. We quickly resolved to escort her out of this evil place to safety, which meant our home city of Ak'anon. We quickly made our wait out of Crushbone, relatively un-harrassed. You know, you would think that if Emperor Crush was holding this girl captive for her magical abilities, he would have gone to some trouble to keep her there. Hmmm...</p>

<p align=left>Emerging from Crushbone safely we bid Azlana farewell. It's always nice to see that tall one...though I do believe she has a difficult time seeing us. Without any more delay we made our way through the Feydark back to Ak'anon. Unfortunately along the way, Wysll seemed to fall to the same spell Wyndelle did and was lost to us...temporarily we hope.</p>

<p align=left>Wyxle, Wyloon and I arrived in Ak'anon with the girl Wynnie without any problems (except a bit of poor sense direction on my part). Upon entering and knowing us safe we began to talk with the girl. I noticed, as the human had said, the she looked quite a bit like us. If I didn't know better, I would say she had our father's eyes (certainly not his nose, though). When I asked her who her parents were, she said she had never actually met her father. Curious. When I asked where she lived so that we may deliver her safely to her mother she said that her mother was out "questing" and she doesn't really have a place to stay. She asked if she could stay with us. Though, we don't have a permanent home in Ak'anon any longer, there was no reason we couldn't get her a room and make sure no harm comes to her.</p>

<p align=left>She seemed very pleased at this and we proceeded into Ak'anon to find a suitable place to sleep for the night.</p>

<p align=left>I don't know about this girl, she seemes nice enough, but something doesn't feel right about her or her story. Bah! But this prophecy has lead us to such strange events and people...</p>
