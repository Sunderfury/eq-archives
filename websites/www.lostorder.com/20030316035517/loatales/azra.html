<p align=left><b>Azra's Travels</b><br><i>by Azra</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Day 1<br>
Today has been hard. I have left the snows of Everfrost on a journey through the den of the Blackburrow gnolls. They are vile smelly beasts, but tis the only way fer me to reach Surefall glade from Halas. I am grateful for the training I have had these last few days, it has made my journey much less harrowing then my trip through the 1st time.</p>

<p align=left>What an odd man he was. Well I shouldn’t say man, It would be more proper to call him an elf. He made me laugh, yet made me cry in frustration, My skills are a pittance when compared to the things he does. He left me these fine things, yet I am a complete stranger to him, what could he want? Oh well it grows dark and I must move on, I cannot camp here lest I be set upon by gnolls.</p>

<p align=left>Day 3<br>
I have recovered my belongings. Somewhere in my rush through Blackburrow, a gnoll pup stripped my pouch from me. His hide now belongs to squire on his way back to Qeynos. I was stopped by one of the short ones today with a message from the elf…what was his name.. Aanlain that was it. His note to me was very sweet, but I cannot fathom his interest in me. Oh well here is the note:</p>

<p align=left>Hello Azra,<br> 
I hope this package finds you in good health.<br>
Remember the things I have shown you and<br> 
Follow Tunare’s guidings, your faith in her<br>
Shall serve you well while I am away. I had<br> 
A cobbler make these boots for you, I hope they<br>
Fit. The battle in Nagafen’s lair is a long one<br>
I know not when I shall be able to break free<br><br>

Your friend,<br> 
Aanlain Treeskin</p>

<p align=left>I could just make out the text that he had scratched out. He misses me! Why would he miss me? we have only known each other a few days. Oh dear what am I to do. He was nice but He’s an elf, and I am human, there is no way that anything could develop between he and I is there? No. No. Ugh. I am putting my thoughts to bed, and myself as well.</p>

<p align=left>Day 4<br>
Surefall glade seems smaller than when I was here last. The birds no longer sing songs as merry as they did before, or is it me that has changed. When last I was here I knew nothing of death, only that which had surrounded my youth. Now I had some skills as a druid and had killed many a denizen of the North. The guildmasters here seem cold and aloof, so unlike the warmth and personal attention that Aanlain has shown me. I find myself wondering where he is and what he is doing. Is it because he is teaching me, or is it something else. So many things seem to be happening at once and my mind is all a jumble. I must walk for a while. Mayhap I shall return to the snows, at least in Everfrost I had to think of nothing but survival.</p>

<p align=left>Day 5<br>
It is morning and new snow has covered everything, erasing all traces of the battle that seems to have happened in my absence. An orc raiding party hit in the night and destroyed some of the outlying homes of Halas. It’s as if mother Tunare wanted to cover the evidence and start anew. I received another message from Aanlain. It seems as if the expedition to Nagafens lair has been frought with tragedy. Though they have recovered the item they were looking for it was not without cost. One of their members was cut down in the process. Thankfully a cleric was near and was able to provide divine intervention and resurrected the poor enchanter. The gloves Aanlain sent are a wonder, they protect my skin much better than the sewn cloth ones I had before. I still cannot resolve the feelings I get when I think of him. </p>

<p align=left>Day 6<br>
I fell through the ice in the river yesterday, the only thing that saved me was the staff Aanlain had left with me. I am now in a rented room in Halas trying to overcome this blasted cold. Why do I stay here in the frozen north !?! A message reached me from Freeport today. When I opened it a single flower fell out with a note attached. It was from Aanlain again! Where is that blasted elf! What is he doing to me? The note read as follows:</p>

<p align=left>Greetings My Druid,<br>
I have found this flower growing in one of the<br>
rare patches of viable soil here in the Lavastorm<br> 
mountains. It reminded me of you so I have sent<br> 
it to you in the hopes that it reminds you of me<br>
It is strong, it survives where others do not, and is<br> 
beautiful beyond measure. I cannot stop thinking<br>
about you. I cherish the short time we had together<br>
and cannot wait to find you once again.<br><br>

I miss you,<br> 
Aanlain</p>

<p align=left>Bah! As if I didn’t have enough to think about he sends this! But truth be told I miss him too, I cannot seem to quench the turmoil in my heart whenever my fool head thinks of him. A shaman has come to see to me about my cold so I will put my thoughts to bed again.</p>

<p align=left>Day 8<br>
I was too tired to write yesterday so I am doing it today. I received word form a surefall messenger. Aanlain is returning to the north in the next few days. I am still unsure of what I will tell him when he arrives. Tunare guide me please! I know not what to do. He is an elf and I am a human there cannot be anything between us can there?!?!
Oh Aanlain please come back to me, tell me what to do!</p>

<p align=left>And so it continues……….</p>
