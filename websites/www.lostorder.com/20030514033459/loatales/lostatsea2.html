<p align=left><b>Lost At Sea, Part Two</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The Admiral was busy about the morning, straightening up and redecorating the home of the Fleet, Everlight. Twas a long night before, and Joxer's head still rang with the loud music of the Moonglow festivities. A strangely familiar scent of perfume filled his nostrils - the pleasing odor coming from one very regal lass that he had made himself aquainted with.</p>

<p align=left>A knock on the front door roused him from his duties; peering out into the courtyard, Joxer could see a man wearing the colors of the Moonglow messenger guild.</p>

<p align=left>"My lord Joxer, I bring ye a missive of most import from a faraway friend -a letter was found in a bottle by a fisherman that claims to be a friend of yours, a mister Gnimoy the Gnome. "</p>

<p align=left>Ah yes. Gnimoy had left for fishing two days ago headed south and must have found this bottle on his journey. Admiral Joxer opened the door, gave the messenger a handful of coins and looked at the letter.....</p>

<p align=left>Lord Brimstone,</p>

<p align=left>Again I am writing of my misadventure in the hopes that somehow my missive will find ye.</p>

<p align=left>Tis been nearly two months on this desolate isle.  The first month went well, my leg slowly healed to the point where I could once again walk, though I now do so with a considerable limp.  My days consisted of hunting fer food, and gathering the bits of me ship together in order to build a crude shelter.</p>

<p align=left>Having completed this task I set about attempting to find some way off this island.  I resolved myself to building a small raft in order to leave this isle the same way I arrived, by boat.  My plans were nothing grandiose, just a simple wooded raft with paddle and a small sail which would be more to make myself visible than to provide propulsion.</p>

<p align=left>My ship off this island is almost finished,  all I need to is carve the oars with which to row my way to the mainland.  Alas, I have barely the strength to even lift my arm and pen this letter, for last week I was bitten by a mosquito.  While one would think that such an insignificant injury should nary bring a stout sailor as meself to his deathbed, it t'was not the bite, but the infection the little swine brought to me that has me so. </p>

<p align=left>I recall in my days as a neophyte mage there was much talk about the "Sleeping Sickness".  Many of the master mages of that time were searching for a cure for this sickness that causes its victims to spend more and more hours of the day asleep, until they're very body withers away and they are no more.  This sickness even forces yer spirit to depart forever from this world.</p>

<p align=left>After being bitten, I took ill.  In my fevered sleep I have had many dreams, strange yet fascinating.  These dreams of steel wagons which need no horse, and glass buildings that touch the very sky disturb me, captivate me, and beacon me to sleep, even after being awake only a short time.  In my dreams I have so many responsibilities, that I can nary afford to wake up lest I fail to fulfill them.</p>

<p align=left>In the little time that I am awake, I have tried to find a cure for this sickness.  As I recall the master mages and healers of Britain never found a cure themselves.  Although they did feel it of little importance, for only dissenters to the crown seemed to take ill and perish in this manor.  Still though I try to keep awake, try to finish my craft and sail home.  But oh I have never seen a woman as beautiful as the one in my dreams, mayhaps a little more sleep this day before I finish my raft, mayhaps a little more.</p>

<p align=left>May the Shard and Tome guide the me lord.</p>

<p align=left>Fleet Master Enosh Flam</p>

<p align=left>Joxer thought long and hard on the letter. He missed his friend, as well as the others in the Fleet, and could only think of the absent Fleet Master and his trouble. "Dear friend," he thought, "may your sail be swift and true and godspeed to Everlight - there will be wine and song waiting for your arrival."</p>
