: Noble Talsn,

: I am glad that thou art making things like this an issue. 
: I myself think that the ultima lore is the core of Ultima and the lore of Ultima can by no means be 
: understood without the eight sacred virtues of the Avatar. But to the question:
: What can a game-code do to promote the virtues?

: 
: How should it work?

: By implementing a quest-engine, but this quest-engine should be 
: modeled as much as possible after Ultima 4. Below is a compiled a list of things affecting
: virtue in u4 and a quest-engine not heeding or failing to explain in detail why it
: does not heed them will not be worth much in my eyes.

: Yet, I would like myself, that only some of the virtue points would be gained through such 
: a quest engine. Points in such virtues like honour (finding objects). Other points should be achieved through regular gameplay e.g. spirituality (meditating at shrines), honesty (paying the right amount or overpaying), valor (killing monsters never running away). It would be very important that the virtue points decayed over time. One had in other words to play this way all the time to really get anywhere. Just like the Avatar has to do in u4.

: But the key thing should be that living a virtuous life in Britannia should not pay off.
: This was the core of virtue in u4. If you in u4 took every advantage e.g. not paying blind 
: reagent vendors any gold at all or grabbing every item you could get your hands on 
: (when they did not belong to you). In short if you took every advantage possible you would 
: very very soon be almost without chance of completing u4 unless you worked very determined
: on the matter. It would be much easier to just delete your character and begin anew.

: 
: What should you gain?

: In term of game advantages, what did the Avatar gain in u4 by being virtuous?
: Close to nothing! By being virtuous you were able to complete the game all right, but
: you power came not from the virtues. Not even your magic was really affected 
: (unlike in u9). There was one advantage only, namely the Mystic Sword and the

: in the end better than the Mystic Sword because you were able to hit the enemy more 
: times before he could hit back, than you could with the sword.

: How could this advantage be translated to UO?
: I suggest that that mystic armour and mystic weapons could be had by the eigthparts
: avatars for free just like Order/Chaos shields can right now for certain guilds. The 
: Order/Chaos are slightly better than ordinary shields but nothing that will make you 
: invincible. To wear these mystic arms and armour would be a great honour because they
: could only be worn by those of high standing in the game-code virtue system.

: 
: But should perfection in a single virtue not be rewarded?

: No!. The Avatar was not rewarded for his faithfulness to the individual virtue.
: Know that the clinging to one virtue alone will inevitable lead to pride, for you will become blinded by thy own righteousness and fail to see the evil your unbalanced relationship to that virtue leads to.
: Yet, indeed the Avatar chose his/her (remember we do not know what sex the Avatar has.) path along one of the Virtue of favour. But there is a huge difference between favouring a virtue above the others and clinging to one virtue alone, neglecting the others.
: And if indeed the Avatar favours one of the virtues then why should the Avatar be awarded for that?
: To be allowed to pursue this virtue of favour should be all the reward the Avatar would ever ask for all his/her toil.

: 
: But what if I dropped below perfection point level in a virtue I once was perfected in?

: Then the game-code would immediately make you drop any mystic armour and arms and after they were dropped they would vanish. At least you would somehow loose your mystic arms and armour at once.
