<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">It was a gray morning
in the Butcherblok mountains. The sulking skies were the color of lead, and a light
drizzle had begun to fall.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The beach was mostly
deserted. The only sounds to be heard were the crashing of the waves and the plaintive
cries of the seagulls which circled in the air.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I don&#146;t
see why we have to be here,&quot; grumbled Walterus.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;&#146;Cause the
King asked us to,&quot; said Bierfreund.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;But why us? We
are warriors, not bloody escorts. I want to fight!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye, so do I.
But the King wouldn&#146;t have sent us if he didn&#146;t think it was important.
Hey&#133;is that Morgf over there?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The two dwarves
walked toward the pier, where a lone dwarf sat, his fishing pole dangling out over the
water.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Hullo,
Morgf!&quot; Bierfreund called out, approaching the old fisherman.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Blimey! If it
ain&#146;t Bierfreund an&#146; Walterus. Come to pay ol&#146; Morgf a visit, have ye?
Well, have a sit. I&#146;d offer ye some fish, but the bucket be empty.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Fish
aren&#146;t biting today?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Not a one.
Either this bait&#146;s gone south, or they all been scared away. I seen a shark
swimmin&#146; around not too long ago.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;How soon do you
figure the next boat will be here?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Morgf shrugged.
&quot;Should be here any minute. Ye goin&#146; for a sail?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund laughed.
&quot;Not me. I&#146;ll keep to solid ground if I can. Naw, we&#146;re waiting for some
folks to get here from Freeport.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Tall
folk?&quot; Morgf spat into the water. &quot;Hell, why can&#146;t they just stay on their
side o&#146; the pond? I keep trippin&#146; over their dead bodies in the woods. Ye think
they&#146;d learn to stay out o&#146; trouble.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Speaking of
trouble&#133;have you heard the rumors lately?&quot; asked Bierfreund. &quot;They say
there are dark days ahead.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye.
Thar&#146;s a storm comin&#146;, an&#146; it&#146;s gonna be a rough one. Me, I just roll
with the punches, same as always.&quot; Morgf nodded his head out toward the sea.
&quot;Here comes yer boat.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund gazed in
awe at the galleon as it drew near. The sheer size of the mighty sea vessels, with their
masts as tall as trees, never failed to impress him. He felt dwarfed in comparison.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Quite a sight,
eh, Walterus?&quot; Bierfreund glanced around. &quot;Where did Walterus go?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">They heard splashing
in the water, and ran to the edge of the pier. Walterus was standing in the shallow water,
wrestling with a shark that was twice his size. He had grabbed it by the back fin, and was
in the process of repeatedly punching it in the head with his meaty fist.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Walterus, what
in the blazes do you think you&#146;re doing?!&quot; cried Bierfreund.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The bloody dwarf
looked up and hoisted the now-unconscious shark into the air. &quot;Breakfast!&quot; he
shouted, a wide grin on his face.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund sighed and
shook his head.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That thar is
the toughest damn dwarf I ever did see,&quot; said Morgf.</font></font></p>
