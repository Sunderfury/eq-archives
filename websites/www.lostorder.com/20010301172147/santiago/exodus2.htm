<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">Once
upon a time, Britain had been the golden center of a magical kingdom. Valiant knights had
patrolled the roads in search of villainy to conquer. Mages and scholars had congregated
here to share ideas and to discuss the mysteries of the world. Intrepid adventures had
sailed forth from its harbor, their eyes aglow with the hope of new discoveries. The Realm
had been young and alive, and Britain was its very heart.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Things have changed
since then.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><img src="Bar_top.jpg" alt="Bar_top.jpg (7979 bytes)" WIDTH="504" HEIGHT="14"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;&#146;Ey,
mister! Can ye spare any coins fer a poor soul in need?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis stopped
and stared at the filthy urchin. The youth could not have been more than sixteen years
old. The robe that he wore was old and tattered, perhaps a gift from some kind-hearted
healer. The boy&#146;s face was covered with scratches and bruises, and he walked with a
limp.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Have you been
in a fight, young one?&quot; asked Sarangoulis.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye,
lord,&quot; said the boy. &quot;I was out in the woods this mornin&#146;, tryin&#146; to
catch some rabbits when three blokes did me in. Took everythin&#146; I had, they
did&#133;even me clothes. I ain&#146;t got nothin&#146; no more, no food, no
clothes&#133;nothin&#146;.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Did you get a
good look at these villains?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well, they was
all tricked out in metal armor, so I couldn&#146;t see their faces. They was chargin&#146;
at me like I was some bloody dragon! They had great big swords, but they didn&#146;t even
use &#145;em. They started castin&#146; spells at me, an&#146; that&#146;s the last bit I
remember. I would o&#146; died if it weren&#146;t for a kindly ol&#146; healer who
happened to pass by. He bandaged me wounds an&#146; pointed me back to town. So here I am,
beggin&#146; fer money to buy food. Only no one wants to help me. They all think I&#146;m
some sort o&#146; thief.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I dunno what to do.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis gazed
around the bank plaza. Everywhere he looked, he saw wealthy men and women milling about,
clad in expensive clothing and armor. Then he looked back at the boy in the dirty old
robe, a boy who had been crushed today, in both body and spirit. He looked at the
boy&#146;s face, a face too young to bear such scars. Looking into the eyes of the youth
was like looking at a fire that has gone out, leaving only the bitter ashes of a hope
cruelly extinguished. It was the face of today&#146;s Britain.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis bent down
and placed a hand on the boy&#146;s shoulder. &quot;You see that tower over there?&quot;
he said, pointing toward the Sorceror&#146;s Guild. &quot;Go there. Tell them that
Sarangoulis sent you. They will take you in, give you food, clothing and shelter. They
will teach you how to make a living for yourself.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Thank ye, yer
lordship!&quot; The boy bowed deeply, and ran off in the direction of the Tower.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It&#146;s the
least I can do,&quot; said Sarangoulis.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Once upon a time,
Britain was known as the City of Compassion. Now, no one has time or desire to help those
in need. There are so many villains in the world that we don&#146;t trust anyone anymore.
How can we? The land is full of dark-hearted people who murder and steal, day after day,
simply because they can. Thieves and killers grow rich and powerful at the expense of the
innocent. They do not care about the misery they inflict &#150; in fact, they relish it.
Virtue and kindness have been replaced by greed and cruelty. There are no kings or gods
&#150; or if there are, they are silent and do not interfere. These are Britain&#146;s
darkest days.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">No wonder that so
many have been enticed by the rumors of Norrath. Paradise or not, how can it possibly be
worse than Britain?</font></font></p>
