<blockquote>
<p align=left>I really do not feel like writing right now, but I will because although my hunting ended with me zoning to evade a dry bone skeleton only to be killed by a spectre that someone was escaping from, I did learn a lot about hunting and my golden one. </p>

<p align=left>I did not expect to see my golden one. I was off hunting by myself to progress a little more so that we could return home and he can begin to teach me how to hunt in Unrest. I was meditating when I felt a spell cast upon me and when I stood up there was my golden one smiling at me. We said hello as we have become accustom to and then I told him I needed to complete my meditation. He sat next to me as he always does keeping a watchful eye. I asked him if we were going to work on anything in particular this eve and he said not this one and I was to go out and hunt and he would observe. </p>

<p align=left>Happy that he was here, I ran about trying to find something within my abilities. It is getting more and more difficult to do. So many creatures are below my ability in this region and I have to travel further out to find them. I rushed about to find something when I came upon a mad man. I paused and cast smite against it. Since it was a caster I stood my ground and tried to do as my golden one instructed. Stun to disrupt, wait until it began to cast and melee to disrupt the mad man's casting. I did quite well but then in my mind I wondered if it was wise to stand my ground. While I was resting up I asked him about it. He said that I was correct… true casters will not run after you so you must stand and do battle. The danger in that, of course, is a creature passing by may attack. Luckily that did not happen. He told me that when I attain the 19th circle of knowledge I will be able to learn a new spell…Holy Might which will not only stun but cause damage and will be good to use when a creature is low in health.</p>

<p align=left>He began asking me of my skills to see if I was prepared to go to Unrest. My melee skill was in the low 60's. He said that was quite good since a cleric's melee skill is four time our level plus 4. Skills like offense and defense is limited to 5 times our level. Then he had to go and ask about my divination. I had gotten it into the low 40's. That was not good since magic skills should be 5 times our level plus 5. After I told him that he asked if I was ready for my test again. All I needed was seven out of ten successful casts. I reminded him that he jinxed me last time he put me to the test. He just laughed. So I started casting and I was only able to do six out of ten. He reminded me that if I had come to him earlier for training this would not be a problem. I reminded him at least I had the spells purchased, just never practiced. Well he got his serious face on and said that if I had begun practicing it at my 5th circle, as should be, it would not be a problem now. Well that is true. Sense magic is a level 1 spell and uses little mana so I could have used it but I always found it boring to practice. Guess I am paying for it now. </p>

<p align=left>There was a sand giant about and I asked him if he wanted to play with it. I knew he did, especially now that he has his new spells. I watched as used his powerful spells against it and ended that nuance's life. I healed him up as best I could then sat next to him to rest. I told him that I did have the desire to cast against it when I saw it only had a sliver of life left. He said it would be a waste of mana. I knew that but what if I could, wouldn't it be a sight to see!</p>

<p align=left>I was running about trying to find something and when I had returned to his side to rest he told me that Konek had paid him a visit. I just said 'oh ya missed it I took down a sand giant with one cast of my mighty spell and now I was level 25!' He just laughed. I just said to him that I wish I could do that but anything worth having is worth earning. Besides if I got too old too quick I would not have the time to practice my skills and truly become a good cleric. He looked into my eyes and told me that if he could he would cast a magic spell upon me so that I would be of the 35th level so that I may stand by his side in battle. </p>

<p align=left>He then got a serious look on his face and told me that he would be around for a long time and we would be together in battle, that his desire for that day would not dim while my eagerness persisted. After a slight pause he continued… our relationship was not a short term one that he has in mind for us as long as I was willing. I told him that I would be by his side as long as he was willing to have me there. The smile that came across his face cannot be described. </p>

<p align=left>I went off again to hunt and then return by his side. I asked him something that I was always curious about… do his hunting companions make fun of him for spending so much time with me. He said they did a little since he protested that we have only a teaching relationship but feared the pretence would not last much longer. When I asked him what he meant he said that he ached to reveal our true relationship but feared that I would not wish to disclose this to the world. What a silly dwarf. I assured him that I would be overjoyed for everyone to know but then I have been afraid that somehow people knowing would harm his reputation. With that said he told me that we must fist tell his Mother as it is proper and would tell those I hold dear, if I had family that is, then we can reveal all to the world. </p>

<p align=left>Of course my first reaction was when do we go home so that I may meet his mother. With a slight laugh he told me when my divination skill passes the test. He grew tired and had to leave so we said our good byes as we have been accustom to and I watched as he went to his place to sleep. </p>

<p align=left>On my next kill I was doing so well against a mummy when a dry bone attacked me. I got rid of the mummy but had to zone. Konek begin his torment upon me so after I returned to Norrath and noticed I was low on food I decided to practice my divination skill. Over and over again I cast sense magic and raised my skill to 56. That done I was preparing food and water when a spectre decided to attack me. The attack was so fast and so surprising that before I could compose myself enough to remember to cast DA I was dead. Konek came over and over again and was making my time so miserable that I decided that once I get my possessions back I would rest. I was so upset at this set back that I was just going to camp for the day without writing, but found that not doing so made me uneasy. The time is late and I must rest for tomorrow. I must make up for this mishap so that I may return home with my golden one to meet with his Mother. </p>
