<blockquote>
<p align=left>Ahhh, 'twas a long day today, a long day indeed. Feelin' a wee bit bored at the beach, I decided 'bouts time did some explorin' away from the coast. So packed up me supplies, and started runnin' north. Learned a few things in town the day before, somethin' to do wit' alchemy and such. I figure it's safe, as long as it's got nutin' do wit' that bloody black magick. </p>

<p align=left>So off I went, in search of somethin' called aqua incanta. That bloody stuff must be more rare than gold, 'cause nobody's sellin' it, and nobody's willin' to give it to me. I managed to find a few bottles here and there, and even bought me some of that quicksilver in a bottle. But fer the life of me, I can't seem to create any oil from 'em. I must be doin' somethin' wrong, jest have no clue yet. Reckon I need to talk to one of them bloody alchemists. They best be tellin' me what's goin' on, or I'm gonna introduce 'em to me crossbow.</p>

<p align=left>Well, I heard that some blokes were meetin' up near Fort Wilshire so I figured I should join 'em. Even met some young magi named Baltazir who's lookin' to join the Order. He seemed like a decent fella, but never can trust some of them magi types. I'll have to keep one eye on 'im. Anyhow, Baltazir and Montesque left shortly thereafter, probably fer some black magick ritual or somethin'. So meself, Wyll Walaryn, Simon de Monfort, and Kileyan the magi decided to head further north into Glendon Wood. O'course, we bashed plenty of skeletons and them stinkin' wasps before leavin' the fort.</p>

<p align=left>That Simon fella must be as strong as an ox. He was covered in steel armor, from head to toe. He led us into Glendon Wood, said he knew some place we could hunt fer treasure. But of all the places to hunt...a prison?! I didn't ask Simon how he knew of the prison, we all gots somethin' to hide from our past. So we took a deep breath, and down we went.</p>

<p align=left>But this prison ain't like any prison I've been in before, 'cause I sure as hell didn't see any guards or prisoners. The whole bloody place is overrun with them filthy little mites. Luckily, Wyll and Simon are a couple of strong blokes so they kept slashin' away at the mites while Kileyan and I held up the rear. Kileyan was busy castin' all sorts of magicks while I took aim with me heavy crossbow. And I even got to try me new frog crotch quarrels! Them frog crotch quarrels are like broadheads, only they be split down the middle. And from the sounds the mites were makin', them quarrels be awfully painful when yer on the receivin' end. We ventured deeper into the dungeon, only to find some dead people who came back to life with a vengeance. Some call 'em zombies, but they jest be walkin' dead to me. Still, they weren't no match fer us, and we sent 'em back into the dirt where they belong.</p>

<p align=left>Ain't nothin' like havin' a balanced huntin' group. Jest needs to get some of them other members involved soon, 'cause their missin' the fun. And before me forgets, heard that me drinkin' partners of the Oaken Mug have some mission of sorts. Still not sure of the details, but I'll have to meet up with 'em soon. Hmmm, perhaps if I mix a tiny bit of ale with this aqua incanta....</p>
