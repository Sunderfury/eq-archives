<p align=left><b>Not Yet Ready</b><br><i>by Guardian of Light</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The heavy oak door came shut with a crash as Guardian Gamael stormed into the House of Architects. An older man, beginning to gray, but still showing the vigor of youth, looked up from the tome of weapon tactics that he was reading, regarding his pupil curiously.</p>

<p align=left>The boy stood tall, well over six feet in height, but Zareah guessed that he had not yet reached his full size. He gazed upon the lad's countenance, noting the bridled fury, the intent gaze, the impatient twitches at the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p align=left>"What is it now Gamael?" the older man asked, wondering just what the cause of the boy's ire was this time. "Patience," he thought. "That's the next thing he needs to learn."</p>

<p align=left>Gamael threw his hands up in disgust. "I don't know. I'm just tired of not doing anything. People waltz into our village, strutting in their shiny armor, making threats, pushing people around. I hate just sitting there and letting them get away with it." The lad pulled his mighty war axe out and sent it spinning across the room, dead into the center of a cross-section of tree placed on the wall for that purpose. The axe buried itself there, the shaft quivering, mimicking Gamael's fury.</p>

<p align=left>"Sit down," Zareah said sternly, and kicked a chair away from the table and in the lad's direction. Gamael grudgingly took the offered seat, knowing that Zareah had something important to say.</p>

<p align=left>"What I do, I do for a reason boy," began the wise warrior. "I agreed to train you, for I saw promise in your eyes, and read the dedication in your heart. And I told you that when you were ready, you would be THE protector of the Order. But until then, you hold your tongue, and your arm."</p>

<p align=left>"But..." Gamael started.</p>

<p align=left>Zareah held up a hand, silencing his pupil. He slowly chuckled to himself. "Lad, you're able right now to handle yourself, the Light knows I have the bruises and scars to show it. But to do your job right, you must be stronger. When you step into a fight, there can be no uncertainty in your mind what the outcome will be."</p>

<p align=left>"But that skeleton Gath, of the OES, he's such a..."</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, I know lad," Zareah once again broke in. "Gath and I have crossed blades more times than you would know. He, and those like him, are your sole reason for existing." Zareah closed his book, marking his page with a black ribbon. "You can't handle Gath of Baal right now. I know him, and I know you. The man's heart holds no fear, and that makes a dangerous enemy of him. You, too, will know that emptiness, but you must first give up the anger, thrust it from you, to better do your job."</p>

<p align=left>"And just what is that job? Standing around beating on an old man all day, while things happen outside, beyond my control?" Gamael's voice rose throughout his rant, and a growl escaped Zareah's lips.</p>

<p align=left>"Know your place boy. I've fought more battles than you have days. Keep your tongue, and keep your head. For there are those out there that would enjoy removing both. You'll know the day. And on that day, evil will truly know fear."</p>

<p align=left>Zareah got up and crossed the room, his long robes swishing across the floor. He pulled the axe from the target, his muscles cording with the effort, and he wondered once again at the boy's amazing strength. Tossing the axe to Gamael, he spoke softly. "Come on upstairs, and grab your shield. There are some new things I want to show you." </p>

<p align=left>The elder warrior grinned cryptically, and lead the way up the staircase, followed by his now-curious student.</p>
