<p align=left><b>Letters From Afar</b><br><i>by Boladorn</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Pale morning late shone through the shutters illuminating a small spot in the otherwise dark and empty room. Dust motes swam joyously in the pale light as small breezes lifted them from their rest.</p>

<p align=left>A crash of metal and the thud of something heavy hitting the floor shattered the silence of the room. A low groan issued from the pile of lambent armor and weapons that had previously been fast asleep before the huge tankard of ale upon the table.</p>

<p align=left>Boladorn groaned again as he picked himself off the floor, and tried to scrape the taste of old shoe leather from his tongue. "Bah! I'll no be drinkin like that agin if'n I can elp it I won't" he whispered.</p>

<p align=left>Gingerly he reached down and gathered the scattered pieces of armor that he had managed to remove the previous night prior to passing out. </p>

<p align=left>Winceing, he lifted the breastplate and made to buckle it on. As he did so a crumpled up piece of blood-stained parchement fluttered to the ground from inside.</p>

<p align=left>It came back to him in a rush. The message was as dire as it was short. Mindful of his headache he reached down and picked up the letter with shaking hands and began to re-read it.</p>

<p align=left>Bola, </p>

<p align=left>As you know I left to search for my misssing brother. This search has been long and arduous. Too long have I been away from my friends and family. I will recount what little I can remember of the events that lead up to this letter. I traveled to the southern-most edge of Antonica and borded a pirate skiff, thinkin that Perth may have joined some ruffian named Joxer...alas bording that ship was my last memory waking in my present condition.</p>

<p align=left>I am being cared for by creatures the likes of which I have never seen. They are similar in appearance to the dreaded Lizardmen of Cazic Thule, yet more evolved by far. I have lost the use of my legs and seem to have suffered grevious injuries to the lower half of my body. Healing as well as my usual repertiore of spells seems to have left my mind for the time being so I have to mend naturally, If I can.</p>

<p align=left>If you receive this letter, make haste to the south, Find this pirate Joxer if you can and retrace my steps, I must be found and returned to Antonica.</p>

<p align=left>Your patron, </p>

<p align=left>Aanlain Treeskin.</p>

<p align=left>Disbelief and anguish crossed his face in equal measure... He was being asked to start a quest that knew no end, that had no easy solution and could even trap him somewhere lost to memory. A smile crept across his face as he thought it over. What a wonderful opportunity for new stories!</p>

<p align=left>Funbling through his pack he grabbed his quill, parchment and ink and hastily scribbled a note.</p>

<p align=left>To Everyone, </p>

<p align=left>Please don't wait for me. I shall return soon.</p>

<p align=left>Good luck and good hunting, </p>

<p align=left>Boladorn.</p>
