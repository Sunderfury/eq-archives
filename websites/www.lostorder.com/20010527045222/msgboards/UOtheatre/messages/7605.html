<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">: 	Santiago wasn’t much of a cook.  To him, cooking was an art almost as mysterious as sorcery – and nearly as dangerous.  Mr. Knife was always quick to tell the tale of Santiago’s very first attempt at meal preparation, which resulted in the ship catching fire.  Marooned on Magincia while waiting for the boat to be repaired, Mr. Knife had tried to teach his captain a thing or two about the culinary art.  He might as well have been teaching a cow how to tell jokes; it was udderly useless.  Santiago had no patience for careful measurements; he couldn’t tell when something was done cooking unless it was charred black and smoking.<p>: 	Whenever Santiago walked into a kitchen, he felt as though he was entering some evil wizard’s laboratory.  He would cautiously walk around, peering at the multitude of bizarre utensils that he had no idea how to use.  He didn’t even know what to call half of them.  To him, a colander was just a bowl with holes (and pretty darn useless).  What others called a spatula, he called a fly-swatter.  Ladles, skimmers, strainers, whisks, tongs – he was thoroughly convinced that most of these were instruments of torture.  Pots of boiling water, sizzling pans, blazing ovens – the kitchen was nothing short of an infernal afterlife for food that had been naughty.<p>: 	But there was one thing that Santiago could cook; one meal that he could fix without destroying the kitchen.  Grilled fish steak – it was his single culinary specialty, and he took great pride in making it (when you have only one specialty, you’ve got to be proud of it).  He never got tired of grilled fish.  He ate it for lunch, for dinner, and sometimes even for breakfast if there weren’t any chocolate chip cookies to be found.  <p>: “Grilled fish <i>again</i>?!”  It was one of Mr. Knife’s favorite exclamations.  “Don’t ye get tired of eatin’ the same darn thing all the time?”<p>: 	“Nope.  Ye ever get tired o’ askin’ the same darn thing all the time?”<p>: 	Let other folks have variety, if they wanted.  Santiago liked grilled fish.  It was easy to make, and it tasted good.  What more could he ask for?<p>: 	So it wasn’t exactly unusual that he was preparing grilled fish steak this morning.  The galley was filled with the aroma of sizzling fish (the odor was to Mr. Knife what garlic is to vampires).  Santiago hummed a bit as he added his own little touches: a pinch of garlic, a dash of chopped ginseng.  He had experimented with other herbs and spices in the past, but with little success.  He found out that it was best to avoid using nightshade; he had accidentally used too much of it in one of his early attempts at breakfast, and poor Mr. Knife had gone into a coma for several days.  Santiago found out later on that nightshade was actually poisonous, and that it was generally not a good idea to use it for food preparation (although it is one of the principal ingredients in Black Skull Rum).<p>: 	When the fish was ready, Santiago shoveled it onto a plate and added a couple of chocolate chip cookies for good measure.  Grabbing a jug of apple cider, he left the galley and knocked softly on the door to the captain’s quarters.<p>: 	“Mornin’, milady,” he said cheerily to the closed door.  “Time fer breakfast!”<p>: 	No answer.  Was she still asleep?  Was she still alive?  Maybe she had managed to slip out of her bonds...maybe she was hovering on the other side of the door, ready to strike him down as he entered.<p>: 	“Oh, well,” Santiago shrugged inwardly.  “Only one way to find out.”  He unlocked the door and pushed it open, half-expecting a dagger to fly out at him.  Feeling no sudden sting or stab, he tentatively entered the room.<p>: 	She was asleep.  Her dark hair was strewn over the pillow like the tendrils of a vine that had taken root and flourished overnight.  The old, musty blanket rose and fell with each slow, deep breath.  As quietly as he could, Santiago crept over to the table by the bed and set the breakfast upon it.  Then he hesitated.   Should he wake her?  The fish would get cold if he didn’t.<p>: He kneeled by the side of the bed, and studied his dormant prisoner.  Mr. Knife had warned him not to get too close to her.  She was just a hostage, he said.  Just a bit of dangerous cargo that they had to transport.  A few days from now, they would drop her off at some port or another, and she would be gone from his life.  A few days, and it would all be over.<p>: How peaceful her face looked in repose – not a trace of anger to be seen.  Was this the face of an assassin?  Where were the marks that villains in novels are supposed to carry?  No scar, no scowl, no hint of the cruel soul inside.  How could iniquity hide itself so well?  Looking at her now, he wished for things to be different than they were.<p>: 	She stirred sleepily and took a deep breath.  Santiago’s heart fell when she opened her eyes and saw him.  The peaceful, contented expression she had worn while sleeping just melted away, leaving only a suspicious scowl.<p>: 	“What are you doing here?” she asked coldly.<p>: 	Santiago feigned indifference.  “Brought ye some food.  Can’t have ye starvin’ to death.”<p>: 	“So you intend to keep me alive?”<p>: 	“Well, that all depends.”<p>: 	“On what?”<p>: 	“On whether ye tell me just what yer father has in mind.”<p>: 	Betsy smirked.  “I’m not telling you anything.”<p>: 	“Figgered as much.  Loyal to the death, even to a traitor.”<p>: 	She shook her head.  “You’d like to think it’s that easy.  This is black, this is white; this is loyalty, this is treason.  But how can you call it treason?  Isn’t loyalty to a false king an even greater treason?”<p>: 	“Takin’ the kingdom by force ain’t the answer.  That’s what I call treason.”<p>: 	“Just like you kidnapped me by force.  Just like you’re holding me here, against my will.”<p>: 	“That’s...that’s diff’rent.  Those soldiers were gonna kill me.  I did what I did fer the sake o’ survival.”<p>: 	“And my father wants the kingdom to survive.  The kingdom is what’s important.  And Lord British has done nothing to save it.”<p>: 	“Nothin’?  He’s the one who built the whole thing!”<p>: 	“Yes, and then left it to rot.”  She sighed.  “I think of the kingdom as a garden.  It used to be beautiful, but it’s been so long neglected that weeds are now choking the life out of it.  It doesn’t matter who the original gardener was; what we need now is a new one.”<p>: 	“We’re not talkin’ about a simple garden here, milady.  We’re talkin’ about a bloody kingdom.  Lord British fought an’ bled to bring it about.  He built it upon Virtue an’ hard work.  An’ now ye just want to rip the whole thing apart.”<p>: 	“Not rip it apart...but change it, yes.  Where are the Virtues today?  Where do you find compassion, or honor?  Sacrifice, justice, humility, spirituality...you just don’t see them anymore.  The Shrines might as well be graveyards, where people go once in a while to mourn the dead.  Here lies Virtue.”<p>: 	“Hah...yer a fine one to talk about Virtue.”<p>: 	“And you are?  A pirate and a cutthroat?”<p>: 	“Call me what ye like, milady, but I know right from wrong.  An’ what yer father’s doin’ is just plain wrong.”<p>: 	“What he’s doing is necessary.  But I guess you’ll never see it that way.”<p>: 	“Reckon yer right, milady.  We’re doomed to be enemies, I s’pose.”<p>: 	Betsy said nothing.<p>: 	“Well that’s that, then.”  He turned to go.<p>: 	“I won’t let you interfere with my father’s plans,” she said quietly.<p>: 	“And I’ll do everythin’ I can to protect the king.”<p>: 	The two of them stared silently at each other for a moment.  <i>Just a hostage,</i> Santiago told himself.  <i>Just a bit of dangerous cargo that they had to transport.</i>  Never in his life had Santiago dealt with cargo like this.<p>: 	“Well enjoy yer breakfast, milady,” said Santiago.  “I hope ye like grilled fish, ‘cause I can’t cook nothin’ else.”  He left the cabin and bolted the door behind him, as if doing so would allow him to forget her.<p>: (to be continued...)<p></font>
