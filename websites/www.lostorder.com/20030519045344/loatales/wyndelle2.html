<p align=left><b>Wyndelle's Misadventures II</b><br><i>by Wyndelle</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>No Sound, No light, No sense of movement. Wyndelle could feel himself screaming, but could not hear it except in his mind. He paused, trying to understand where he was and what was going on. The pause did nothing for Wyndelle. He decided to do what seemed the sensible thing to do for someone in this situation... he resumed screaming. The gut wrenching sensation returned, and with it, light, sound and all the other senses.</p>

<p align=left>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaa.........Aaaa...aa...a?" screamed Wyndelle. He looked around what appeared to be a small room in an old tower. Completing his circle his eyes came across an old work table, and behind it............ the strange old gnome.</p>

<p align=left>"Ya through yellin?" asked the old gnome... "I dunno are ya gonna do that again anytime soon?" replied Wyndelle.</p>

<p align=left>"Yer a cheeky one aren't ya..... Bah! no more talking... We have much to do young Wyndelle. I am going to work you harder than you've ever been worked before, by the time I'm done with ya, you'll have wished you had tried bein a warrior instead of a mage." shouted the gnome. He slowly raised his arm and pointed at a door on the other side of the room. "Behind that door is a staircase that leads to my library and laboratory. See if you can make yerself useful and go make it presentable. I've not been in there for more than 200 years, there's likely to be some dust about.</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle resigned himself to getting dirty and headed for the steps. As he opened the door a spot of light and heat shot through the crack and stopped just shy of the old gnome’s face.</p>

<p align=left>A small voice came from the spot of light.... "DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT"S LIKE TO EAT ROACHES AND SPIDERS FOR 200 YEARS!?!? YOU INCONSIDERATE, SHRIVELLED OLD...... Oh.... you have company said the elemental.</p>

<p align=left>The old gnome crossed his eyes, a look of amazement on his face "I am truly sorry Gebarn my elemental friend... I grow forgetful sometimes and I have much to think about lately.... such as our young guest here” said the gnome gesturing towards Wyndelle.</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle looked more closely at the spot of light and saw that it was indeed a fire elemental... a teeny tiny fire elemental. Wyndelle couldn't help himself.... still full of adrenalin and excitement from the trip, he burst out laughing at Gebarn. This caused the already angered Gebarn to set flame to the seat of Wyndelle’s pants.</p>

<p align=left>“ENOUGH!!” yelled the gnome. “Both of you remove yourselves from my presence. Wyndelle use your meager talents and summon Gebarn some sustenance, as he as been without real food for quite some time. Gebarn… follow Wyndelle to the lab and fill yourself, then assist him with making the lab and library useable again. If I so much as hear a peep from either of you, I will banish you both to the plane of fear. Now BEGONE!!!” yelled the old mage.</p>

<p align=left>Mumbling curses under his breath, Wyndelle trudged out the door and down the steps, his feet kicking up small clouds of dust with every footstep. Thoughts of the future mingled with thoughts of cleaning 200 years of dust from the bookshelves he could see in the room below.</p>
