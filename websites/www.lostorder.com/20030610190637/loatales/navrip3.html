<p align=left><b>Into The Night, Part One</b><br><i>by Navrip</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The darkness crept around the temple like a living being, slithering through every crack in the mortar, oozing through the windows, and oppressing everything that lived. The young priestess shivered under her robe, the torch she held barely giving off enough heat to warm her body or light to warm her soul. “Light be with me,” she whispered, her hand straying to the symbol she wore under her robe.</p>

<p align=left>A ball of light sputtered into existence in front of her. She smiled, as the magical light penetrated the shadows like her torch could not. She walked farther along her assigned watch route for the night. As an initiate, she was given watch duty at the worst times. She disliked the duty, but for her god, she would do anything. </p>

<p align=left>As she neared the end of her route, she came upon the watch tower. She figured that a few minutes break to go inside and warm herself wouldn’t hurt her watch. It had been years since anything had happened to the temple. Besides, there were scores of guards trained at watching for intruders and could pick up her slack. She opened the door to the tower and warm firelight poured out into the dark knight.</p>

<p align=left>The two men on duty turned in annoyance at the intrusion. A game of cards sat on the table in front of them, as did several piles of gold coins. When they saw her, they fell to their knees. “Greetings, sister,” one guard said. “To what do we owe the pleasure of this visit?”</p>

<p align=left>“Rise,” she said. “I am but an initiate, you need not kneel for me.” The guard that had spoken to her grumbled and stood, the other rose a bit more hesitantly. </p>

<p align=left>“So, what brings you here?” the guard repeated, this time in a less friendly manner.</p>

<p align=left>The priestess smiled. “I merely wish to share the warmth of your fire for a few minutes. It is cold out in the night and dark as well.”</p>

<p align=left>The second guard, who, until now, had not said a thing, suddenly jumped to get her a chair. She looked at him and noticed that he was quite young. Perhaps a few years her junior. “Here you go, milady,” he said, setting a chair down for her.</p>

<p align=left>She smiled kindly and settled down into it. She closed her eyes lightly and let the warmth of the fire flow into her and soothe her soul. “Quit yer gawking!” the one guard spat.</p>

<p align=left>“Yes sir,” the younger one said. She opened her eyes and saw the young man scurry to his chair at the table. “My deal, sir?” </p>

<p align=left>“Aye, it is,” the older guard growled. The young man dealt out a hand of cards. As an initiate, she was forbidden from games of chance, thus she didn’t really understand what was going on. The young guard laid his cards on the table, with a grin splitting his face.</p>

<p align=left>“Damn cheater,” the older guard spat, tossing his cards to the table in disgust. The young guard whooped in joy and scooped the piles of gold together, sweeping them into a bag at his waist.</p>

<p align=left>“Is that true, sir?” she asked. “Did you really cheat?” </p>

<p align=left>The young guard’s face turned bright red. “Well, you see… I, uh,” he stuttered.</p>

<p align=left>“Naw, he ain’t cheat,” the older guard said, with a jovial chuckle. “Damn good cards player though. Best I’ve ever had the joy of playing with! Even though he just cost me a good week’s pay. But we’ll win that all back next week at the festival, eh?”</p>

<p align=left>The younger guard grinned sheepishly. “Aye sir, that we will. I hear that they’ve got the sword of Rengarth as the grand prize! That must be worth thousands!”</p>

<p align=left>The older guard laughed. “Indeed it would! Imagine, that old thief killed by one of his own traps! Quite amusing, if you think about it. He escapes hundreds of the king’s best men, but gets beaten by himself!”</p>

<p align=left>The priestess had no idea what they were talking about, but smiled anyways. The young guard turned to her and suddenly went silent. The older guard raised his eyebrow with a glint of humor in his eyes. “So lady,” the older guard asked, “I think young Metry here would like to know your name.”</p>

<p align=left>The young guard, Metry, shot the older one a withering glare, which only made the older one smile harder. She just smiled. “Of course, my name’s Lindsy,” she said, bowing politely to him.</p>

<p align=left>A lopsided grin broke across his face. “Well, Lindsy, I’m Private Metricus. My friends all call me Metry.”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy smiled. “A pleasure to meet you Metry,” she said, bring another rush of red to his cheeks.</p>

<p align=left>“Aye! And I’m Lieutenant Agurhar!” the older guard said, slapping Metry on the back. “So lady, are you planning to go to the fesitval?” </p>

<p align=left>“Aye, I had indeed. The festival of Cranth is one I make a habit of attending every year.”</p>

<p align=left>“Well,” Agurhar said, “do you happen to have a young man to go with you?”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy smiled. “No, as a matter of fact, I don’t.”</p>

<p align=left>“Ah, a shame a young dear such as yourself has to be alone. I’d take you, but my wife would surely have my head for that!” Agurhar said, chuckling as he nudged his elbow into Metry’s ribs. Metry tried to brush him off, but he finally gave in to his superior’s nudging.</p>

<p align=left>“Uh, Lindsy, would you like to, um, well, attend the festi-“ </p>

<p align=left>Metry never finished his sentence. Alarms went off around the temple. Metry and Agurhar jumped up and grabbed things off the wall. Metry gapped a thin scimitar, while Agurhar reached for a huge two-handed axe. Another guard stuck his head into the door. </p>

<p align=left>“Caine’s escaped,” he said. “Get to your posts immediately and watch for him. We can’t let this criminal escape our justice!”</p>
