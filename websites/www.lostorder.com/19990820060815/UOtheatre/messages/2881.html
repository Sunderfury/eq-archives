<font face = "arial" color = "#800000">I have read many boards with regards to Brittania.  And I can say that this is the best board for people to come to and not get flamed beyond belief.  I have been quite amazed at the 'debates' of other boards. They seem to be a contest in who can speak with the most cutting of wits.
