<p align=left><b>New Beginnings, Part II</b><br><i>by "the record keeper"</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The hunched figure once again leaned over his old oaken desk, quill in hand. The ink touched to the parchment, and his stroke was clean and steady, with a penmanship of unequaled skill. The tale continued....</p>

<p align=left>The stranger learned soon enough that the inhabitants of this world already spoke his language, which was a blessing he had not counted on. The grass here was green, the sky blue, and the folk were, for the most part, friendly. he soon learned that the name of this town, the one he would call home for now, was known as Holtburg. It was a far northern town, and for the most part isolated. Isolated as much as a town in this strange new world could be, anyway. There were, in this world, wondrous things called 'portals' that have existed for longer than most remembered. These 'portals' linked all the known towns and common places with a mystical sort of instant travel, traversing great distances with ease.</p>

<p align=left>He remembered something similar from a long time ago, moongates or something, but that was not important here and now.</p>

<p align=left>The stranger worked odd jobs for the locals, working farms and making deliveries, gaining trust and a reputation. Soon enough, he was being recognized by name. The people of this world, a world he now knew as 'Dereth', accepted him faster than he ever thought possible. It seemed that everyone here was also an estranged traveler from a great distance as well.</p>

<p align=left>One day, he recognized a powerful mage in the town square that he had seen before pass through, and began some casual conversation. They became friends, and so began the newcomers education in the magics of Dereth.</p>

<p align=left>The newcomer was no stranger to magic, having been an accomplished mage himself on other worlds, in other times. His knowledge grew quickly, and his skill soon followed. He chose the path of what Dereth knew as a 'war mage'.</p>

<p align=left>So the newcomer was beginning to feel less and less of a stranger in this new world. His confidence grew daily, and soon enough he felt he was ready to try his newfound skills in the wild, and test the dangers and challenges that this new world represented.</p>

<p align=left>He packed his gear, his spell reagents, and wearing the meager clothing that his short career of odd jobs had provided, and set off for the hills to find his new fame and fortune in the rich lands of Dereth.</p>

<p align=left>The hunched figure rested his pen in it's well, and pushed to parchment to the side to dry. He rubbed his eyes, stretched, and went once again to the shelves for more candles, the night had seemed to grow a bit colder and darker as his tale continued....</p>
