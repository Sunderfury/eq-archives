: Recently, the village of LOA on the Atlantic shard, had it's 'Blessings' (decorations) compromised and a house was planted on top of them. 

: We had benches, with some trees, and a few rocks here and there. This was located in our clearing and offered a nice place to sit and watch our visitors spar, or make transactios with our members/vendors, or to simply enjoy conversation with whomever.

: Now, a house was placed on top of this setting, pushing the blessings out of the way and basically ruining the magic and charm of our village. 

: We were upset and we aggressively went after the person who did this to us... much like bees would act if their hive was shaken up. This is the setting for what I am about to show you:
