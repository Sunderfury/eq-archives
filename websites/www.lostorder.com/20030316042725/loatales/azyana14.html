<blockquote>
<p align=left>I awoke early with a better mind set this day and so as each day begins I prepared my food and water and then cast my protective spells upon myself.</p>

<p align=left>Mostly uneventful I just found it frustrating at the lack of creatures within my abilities, with most being below. There was an Ogre near by who seemed to have gotten into quite a battle barely surviving so I healed him up as best I could. I continued on hunting and, when I had the mana, healed him and cast my protective spells upon him. They are not much at this time but he seemed to appreciate it. Later on I found a ghoul that was equal to my abilities and, although unsure of what my success would be, I engaged it in battle. Though partially resistant to my casts, I found myself holding my own and saw this same Ogre keeping a watchful eye upon me. After I released the ghoul from it's misery the Ogre just wandered off. As I sat meditating, I remembered what my golden one said… to help others when you have the mana to spare. It seems that what you have to give will come back to you some how. In this case it was the watchful eye of an Ogre… some day it may be something else. </p>

<p align=left>My golden one showed up for only a brief moment. During our time together I began to cast invisibility vs undead on him and I had 7 successful casts with one added in for good measure. Home we will be going soon…home to further my training, to meet his mother and soon after to tell all how much we mean to each other. I am quite nervous about meeting his mother and even more so of the reaction of folks when they hear of our commitment to each other. Ah well, no matter what anyone says I'll always be by his side. We said our good byes as we have grown accustom to and he was off over the hill….</p>
