: 1)  ability to sell back packhorses  minus a small rental fee 
: 2)  if you cant tame it   it cant be transferred to you  (except horses) - this would eliminate the 70 tame\70 lore usually immature pks who get some dragons to pk with and hog dungeon spawns for gold
: 3)  a more reasonable amount of pets for gm tamers -- to at least give us the flexbility to save our cherished companions -- like a total of 25 slots, but only five of those could be dragons or mares - which would let us have ostards, bears, wovles and some variety in of pets

: and various other solutions were offered as well
