<blockquote>
<p align=left>I am your loyal servant in all things, but I wish to bring to your attention a possibility
which I am not sure we have been pursuing.</p>

<p align=left>Last evening, while part of the unit sent to deliver the urgent message to Ambassador
K'ryn in the Ogre "city" of Oggok, I was struck down by numerous Orcs, and brought 
back via the Ebon Binding to Neriak. However, I had an urge within me to serve you,
and deliver the message, rather than trust the others of the motly band assembled.</p>

<p align=left>I was able to find assistance from a source most unexpected - I am sure you are away,
but I was not, that there are followers of the dark ways who are Gnomes! Yes, the
short ones, who seem so frivolous, seem to have those that follow the ways of Necromancy.</p>

<p align=left>One of their number, a fellow Necromancer named Wenceslaus, agreed to bring me my
things such that I might continue to Oggok and deliver your missive to the Ambassador.
He was quite helpful, although I used important supplies (bone chips) as a bargaining
chip. I think it might be worthwhile to pursue an alliance of sorts with this faction of
Gnomes. If we could assist them in taking Ak'anon, that might well provide a foothold
from which we could strike against our true enemies - the pale elves of the Faydark.</p>

<p align=left>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p align=left>Teuar</p>
