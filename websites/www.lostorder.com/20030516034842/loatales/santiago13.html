<p align=left><b>Up On The Roof</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>McRoe shivered and rubbed his hands together. What a miserable day this was! Cold, grey and utterly dismal, just like the stone monsters nearby. The apprentice mage tried not to look at the leering faces of the gargoyles – faces fixed forever in terrible masks of rage. Supposedly, the builders of the abbey had placed them here to frighten away any evil spirits. And although their baleful stone eyes stared outward and away from him, he still felt as though he was trespassing upon their domain, and with every apprehensive footfall he made, he half-expected them to come alive and drive him away.</p>

<p align=left>The wind did nothing to ease his mind. One moment it was silent, the next it was howling dolefully all around him like a chorus of lost souls. Invisible, terrible music, it spoke of hopelessness; it sang of misery and discomfort. And all the while it breathed upon him, chilling him and filling him with cold, bitter despair. No warmth, no hope, no meaning – just a never-ending numbness.</p>

<p align=left>“What am I doing up here?” he asked himself, though he already knew the answer. Hunger had brought him here, as well as desire, impatience, laziness – a host of devils against which even an angel might fall. Power. His chapped lips murmured the word aloud, like a holy mantra. Power, to fulfill all of his needs, to give him everything he wanted. Power, to make a name for himself, allowing him to rise above the middling crowd and join the ranks of the elite. Power was the answer to every question, and he had pursued it here, to this cold and lonely rooftop.</p>

<p align=left>He knew that it was a forbidden path he was following, but that only meant that he must walk it cautiously. Secrecy and isolation had been made into necessities. No one would find him up here; no one would disturb his concentration. Taking a deep breath, he prepared to enter a trance. His mind would leave his body to explore the mystical secrets that lay buried in the astral plane. If all went well, he would awaken a few hours from now with a greater understanding of arcane power.</p>

<p align=left>Let others complacently obey the laws of the ancients. Let others walk the dull, drudging paths of the mundane, patiently earning their skill through honest labor. He did not want to wait. He wanted power, and he wanted it now.</p>

<p align=left>His eyes closed, and his spirit began to rise away from its house of flesh and bone, lifting skyward on a journey toward quick and easy power.</p>

<p align=left>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p align=left>“Blimey!” Santiago stopped and panted. “How many bloody stairs is thar in this tower? Figger I’m almost up to heaven by now.”</p>

<p align=left>But there were no pearly gates when he finally reached the top. His gaze drifted out across a narrow landscape of dull grey stone, punctuated here and there by squatting gargoyles. He strolled over toward one of the stone statues and clapped his hand on its shoulder. “Heck of a day, ain’t it, matey?”</p>

<p align=left>The gargoyle offered no comment. Santiago shrugged and reached into his pack, carefully drawing out his old wooden lute. He plucked at each of the strings in turn, listening carefully to make sure each one was in tune. It was something he had once seen a musician do in Britain; in truth, he had absolutely no idea whether the strings were in tune or not, but at least no one could fault him for not following through with the standard procedure.</p>

<p align=left>Then he tilted his head to one side and listened – not to his own hopeless strings, nor to the growing voice of the wind. There was something else, a distinct sound carrying faintly through the chill morning air. It sounded like…chanting.</p>

<p align=left>Still holding the lute in his hand, Santiago crept slowly across the old stone roof, carefully avoiding the steep downward slants that might send him sliding to his death far below. He passed from spire to spire, pausing at each gargoyle to see if it was doing the chanting. But they were as silent as they seemed, and yet the chanting continued. He was getting closer.</p>

<p align=left>Finally, he reached the eastern edge of the abbey roof, and saw a man in red robes standing there. His eyes were closed, but he was murmuring strange words to himself…words that Santiago could only suppose were devilish mystical incantations. A wizardly assassin, no doubt of it!</p>

<p align=left>There was only one way to deal with such foul villains. Santiago ran up behind the mage and clubbed him in the head with his lute.</p>

<p align=left>The scream that accompanied the mage’s fall to the ground far below was a delightful music to Santiago’s ears. It was only a few seconds long, punctuated by a dull ‘thunk’ at the end.</p>

<p align=left>“Blimey!” said Santiago, inspecting his precious lute for damage. “That’s the first time anybody’s ever died from me music!”</p>

<p align=left>He began to hear voices from below. Peering over the edge of the roof, he saw that a crowd had gathered around the fallen man, a crowd that was now full of fingers pointing upwards toward him. “Murderer! Get him!”</p>

<p align=left>Suddenly, it occurred to Santiago that not everyone might understand why he had sent a man to his death just now. Shortly thereafter, it also occurred to him that it was time to get off the roof…and quick!</p>
