<p align=left><b>An Unexpected Pilgrimmage</b><br><i>by Simon DeMontfort</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>"This is of great importance for him", said Tasslehof Windrunner, eyeing
his friend's frowning face. "The path of the warrior is what he has
chosen,  quite like the Aluvian Hero". Zaphod the Great reluctantly took
out a strange key from beneath his tunic and unlocked the glowing
doorway to Thorsten Cragstone's crypt. "Enter, Paladin Simon", again
said Tasslehof with a warm and kindly voice. The two friends moved out
of the way to let the heavily armored figure in.</p>

<p align=left>At first, all was blindness, as if the Shard of Light itself was
contained in this very chamber. As his eyes slowly grew accustomed,
Simon de Monfort stared in awe at the polished stone coffin, quietly
sitting in the center. His heaume fell with a loud clanking sound on the
cold hard floor.  Soon,  both of the knight's knees followed the object
in its descent A long prayer and meditation to Thorsten began.</p>

<p align=left>Other adventurers, hunting for beasts and treasures in the Underground
city, peeked into the tomb and came in. They started asking questions
about the place and who was buried there. Tasslehof answered their
demands with a wondrous story. He told them of a time when the Empyreans
were forced to leave Dereth through Asheron's portals before the Olthoi
menace. He explained to them how the Aluvian, coming into Dereth, were
made slaves by the Olthoi for many many years. He recounted the
rebellion that followed and the feats of the two Aluvian leaders, Elysa
Strathelar and Thorsten Cragstone.  Tasslehof ended with the death of
Thorsten, fighting the Olthoi Queen and liberating the humans from the
insect's claws.</p>

<p align=left>Enthralled by the story, the adventurers listened with great curiosity.
But soon they reverted to their more.  usual nature. "Blast! Let's pry
the thing open and see what's inside!" shouted one of them. Others
started running and jumping about the chamber, while a most daring one
climbed on the coffin. "Sacrilege!", yelled Simon de Monfort,  standing
suddenly  high on his legs. "How dare you think of pillage after
learning the deeds of such a courageous man?" In his rage, his fist
landed directly on the coffin. There was a stunning  flash of holy
light. Simon saw it. But most of it he saw not with his eyes. The light
had burst elsewhere.</p>

<p align=left>All was white. Nothing but pure light. Light so bright Simon could not
see his own body. A deep voice came, resounding in what must have been
his head. "Sad indeed is it to see that so many humans already forgot
what occurred merely ten years ago. They act as if the menace was gone
forever. It has not. I have seen the hive, I have fought it for so long.
Many still learn to use a blade and conjure fire. But very few keep in
mind why." The voice paused and started again: "A Queen will return. The
land shall bleed. Never lose the focus."</p>

<p align=left>When Simon came back to reality, he was walking out of the crypt with
Tass and Zaphod. His head ached,  a sharp pain only worsened by the
shouts and laughter coming out of the now overly crowded tomb chamber.
"That is quite a bump you have gained there Paladin. You almost opened
your head there on that stone corner. Had us real worried", Tass told
him, smiling. "Aye, quite",  briefly replied Simon. He was lost in his
thoughts, wondering if the prophetic voice really had existed. Rounding
a corner, Tasslehof turned and faced him. "Did I tell you I saw an
Olthoi real close lately? T'was a frightening site! Of course I had to
leave in quite a hurry!", laughed he. He looked Simon intently in the
eyes and added: "Battling an Olthoi one on one is the utmost challenge a
warrior could dream of. The time will come for you to face it my lad.
You might as well prepare for it right away!"  The Akalabethian leader
winked and darted up a flight of stairs, leaving there a very
dumbfounded paladin.</p>
