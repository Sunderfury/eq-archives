<p align=left><b>Fire in the LOA Village</b><br><i>by Kyle Chalybaeus</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A lone shadowy figure watches young Albert playing with a grown woman outside the Brewman’s tavern. An evil grin came upon Kyle’s face as he watched the boy. “Soon you will learn the meaning of discipline boy…soon you will learn what true pain is”, Kyle said softly. Kyle noticed that the boy was playing in a clearing surrounded by woods and that the trees and grasses were very dry. Kyle leaned down and conjured up a spell that would cause the boy to be surround in flames. To Kyle’s amazement the fire quickly grew out of control and the boy was trapped. Hearing the child scream sent a feeling of extreme pleasure up and down his spine….he had always enjoyed hurting that boy. Kyle moved further back so not to be seen.</p>

<p align=left>Crossed Eyed-Mary and Albert were yelling at the top of their lungs for help as the flames grew. Suddenly Lady Gwen and Bentley came running out of the tavern to see what was going on. “Damn” muttered Kyle as he saw Gwen and Bentley coming to the boy’s aid. Lady Gwen threw her cloak over herself and ran straight through the flames grabbing Albert and carried him to safety. Gwen quickly tended to the boy’s wounds and held him tightly in her arms to comfort him. Both Albert and Mary were crying uncontrollable. Bentley was working on putting out the flames praying that the whole LOA village would not go up in flames. To his amazement, Bentley was able to cast four water elements to assist him with the flames. After a few minutes the fire was out and the “children” were taken back into the tavern.</p>

<p align=left>Kyle said to himself, “ You were lucky this time Albert, but I will get you boy…..just wait and see…I will find you alone and you will have to answer to me.”</p>
