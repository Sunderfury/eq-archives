<p align=left><b>A Beloved Memory Of My Youth</b><br><i>by Jediit</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>"While I cannot fault your muscianship, your subject matter leaves a bit to be desired, son..." 
Jedyyt told the young apprentice bard seated cross legged before him. Little Jediit was
plucking happily on the crudely made harp he had just finished in his Instrument Crafting
class at the Bardic Collegium, and he was busy testing it out with a ballad he had composed
while bored in one of his dryer classes. </p>

<p align=left>"What's wrong with it? I thought it was funny, and it has a nice little twist at the end, 
like you taught me to do."</p>

<p align=left>Jedyyt coughed uncomfortably, trying to explain the impossibilities, and even widespread
conflict, that a song detailing the love of a fair trollish maiden and an aloof dwarven cleric
would cause. Especially when sung by his son who possesed the familial gift for transporting
listeners to the world of the Singer's creation.</p>

<p align=left>"It IS an amusing air, Half-Note, but you should understand that you have obligations as a
Bard. A song such as this would be better suited for a close gathering around a fire with your
friends, but not to be performed at large. You must learn when to play a light and funny ditty
and when to entrance your audience with the latest news of ,for instance, the on going war 
against the Crushbone Orcs.</p>

<p align=left>"A Bard's duty, Half-Note, is to instruct people that may have little to no education and to
enrich the lives of everyone they come across. To the tired farmer that is relaxing in a tavern
with a cold frosty mug of ale after a long day of tedious and repetetive work, you will be his
only link with the world beyond."</p>

<p align=left>Jediit, who had been listening raptly with his head cocked to the side smiled sweetly and
leaped up from the floor. Harp in one hand, pen and parchment clutched in the other, Jediit
hugged his bemused father tightly and dashed out the open window. (it was closer then the
door...Jediit)</p>

<p align=left>Shaking his head and trying to contain his laughter, Jedyyt shouted after the quickly
retreating figure of his son, "And where are you off to, Half-Note?"</p>

<p align=left>"Cant very well be a link to the world if i have not seen it, now can I, Daddy?" came the
impudent reply.</p>

<p align=left>"Very well, Half-Note, just remember to get back before breakfast or your mother will have
one of her fits again." Thinking fondly on how much fun it was when he had made his first
journey into the world abroad, Jedyyt returned to his lunch.</p>
