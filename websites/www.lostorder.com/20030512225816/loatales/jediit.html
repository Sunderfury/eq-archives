<p align=left><b>A Rude Gnome? Never!</b><br><i>by Jediit</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Exhausted by our battle with the recent patrol, Lumil and myself were recuperating, him with
his books, me with a bunched up feather of soft down. (dont. i was picking lice and other dirty
parasites out of my hair for a week. finally i had to ask Oogle to concoct me a salve or ointment
to get rid of them. while stupefied with my question, my good brother whipped something up.)
((dont. although well meaning, and effective at ridding the bugs i got from the birds, it turned 
raven-black hair a ghastly shade of high elven white. and that is not even mentioning the smell..))</p>

<p align=left>Hours passed and night fell. Night on Lake Rathetear is a pleasant experience, as even in the
worse of weather, the lake hold in warmth as my brother Taronus holds money. That night, a
pleasant breeze blew from the east, holding the scent of rain and fresh life. As well, the moon
hung low in the sky, transforming a place that was pretty in the first place to a stunning landscape
of soft white light and blue shadows. It was quite the surreal experience, but poor Lumil missed
most of it because he was so deep into his books. Sometimes i think that these mage types
spend too much time thinking about abstract, non-concrete things when beauty and wonder, even
magic as the druids would tell you, lie just inches away. </p>

<p align=left>Then again, if lumil had been more observant of nature, he might have been less skilled in his chosen
science, and i might be decorating the floor of this beautiful vale we rested in, rather then the 
aviaks.</p>

<p align=left>Eventually, Lumil called me to the vale to partake in some dinner he had whipped up using a 
magical fire elemental. It was quite comical to see him roasting a large rabbit that I had somehow
caught with the snares one of the Rangers of the Order had showed me how to make. (i think it
was Sunmoon...but it might have been Dalyn. nononono, it was definitely Dalyn as Sunmoon 
no longer will teach me anything after the week trying to explain the basics of tracking) So i took
the rocks i had been skipping across the lake, and threw them as far as i could. The way they
distorted the reflection of the the moon was quite beautiful and i began to toss rock after rock,
trying to see if i could make the moon change shape.</p>

<p align=left>"Jediit, if you plan on eating this eve, you better get back here! the hare is burning!" Indeed, the
smell of slightly blackened rabbit wafted to me. Scampering back to the camp, watching over 
my shoulder at the lake's surface, i barely noticed the gnome that stood in my way until the last
moment. Luckily, we bards are known for our quick reflexes, so i dodged by him and fell into a 
large and particularly thorny berry bush. </p>

<p align=left>"mmm. i love blackberries! i bet they will go good with roasted hare!" i mused quietly to myself
as i gathered handfuls of berries and held them in a makeshift basket of my jerkin. Munching 
happily, i had forgotten all about the impetus for my meeting with the bush.</p>

<p align=left>" whatyouthinkyoubedoingyoucrazybard? I'mgoingtoripoutyourliverandboilyoureyeballs!"the gnome
squeaked. While he was taking a breath, i managed to get in a word or two. (i am somewhat
good at talking with gnomes...some say because i like the sound of my voice...its more that i like
the sound of conversation, but silence is nice too...so peaceful)</p>

<p align=left>"I am dreadfully sorry about almost hitting you friend, perhaps you would consider a meal as
suitable payment for your grievous injuries?" i said in my best imitation of my instructor when he
told me about how to be polite and tell people what they want to hear while getting them to do
what you want them to. a really useful lesson!</p>

<p align=left>"well,maybeitwillhelp, youuglysackofbones. mynameisDrakonandIamthegreatestservantoftheplague
masterever!"</p>

<p align=left>Nodding bemusedly, i set off for our camp, where an angry lumil waited with an even angrier
fire elemental. (i think it was angry...they always look like that so maybe i was wrong)
After consuming a halfway decent meal, which would have been much better if Lumil hadn't burnt it,
we sat back around the fire elemental. I was still quite hungry as the gnome ate most of my share
of the rabbit, so i was popping blackberries into my mouth when the gnome stood up and looked d
around.</p>

<p align=left>Speaking somewhat slower, perhaps because he was full with my rabbit, "soI guessthat therewas
abattleofsomesort? whata coincidence."</p>

<p align=left>"and what coincidence is that?" Lumil said warily. (lumil, being better schooled at recognizing
the chosen caste of other mages knew he was a necromancer and disliked him. it was a mage
thing)</p>

<p align=left>"well, yousee ihave comehere tokill thesebirds soyou aregoing tohave tomove."</p>

<p align=left>blinking in disbelief, i had to stiffle a chuckle at the sight of the little gnome threatening the 
stalwart magician and a competent bard. Nonetheless, i began to whistle a calming tune as
i saw that Lumil was infuriated.</p>

<p align=left>"Come now friend, surely you do not mean to force us to move...besides, would you not be better
serving your master of the plague by fighting more worthy..."</p>

<p align=left>my words were cut short by the crashing of a large something in the bush behind lumil and myself.
as i turned around, a giant skeleton stepped into the light, dwarfing the three of us.</p>

<p align=left>"err...nevermind, we were just leaving" I said, pulling the magician behind me. It was quite 
interesting to see Lumil turn the color of his elemental, but i thought we should retire and talk
abit before we started a duel with this one.</p>

<p align=left>"I...will...roast that impudent little menace..." Lumil said through clenched teeth.</p>

<p align=left>Thinking of what he did to that rabbit, i was inclined to support Lumil, but my bardic duties 
prevented me from allowing such a fight.</p>

<p align=left>"Let me speak with him, friend, i know how to deal with his kind. And we of the Order really 
prefer to solve conflict by reason and kindness then with beatings and violence"</p>

<p align=left>Lumil sighed deeply and struggled to keep himself under control as i strode back into the vale.</p>

<p align=left>"whatare youdoing back? Ithought itoldyou toleave."</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, but it occured to me, what is a necromancer of your ability doing waylaying such a small
patrol here? Surely you are not afraid of fighting a more challenging opponent? I thought not.
I believe i know of a place where you would be much happier, and your dark magics put to better
use."</p>

<p align=left>Pitying the poor aviaks i was leading this rude resident of Ak'anon, i lead him to a large outpost
consisting of a great tower overlooking the whole lake, with a long staircase leading up to the 
lookout's perch. with delight in his eyes, the gnome promptly forgot me and began to inflict
poisonous ruin and darkness upon the unhappy birds. Shrugging, i hopped back into my boat
and went to rejoin Lumil.</p>

<p align=left>Upon my return, I saw that, to my glee, Lumil's shade of bright red had not faded, although he
had summoned an elemental made of water to replace the fire one. Seeing his gaze, i turned 
behind me and was greeted by the large, drooling visage of a troll.</p>

<p align=left>"Yu see Bial friend Drakon? Drakon sposed tu meet Bial heer."</p>

<p align=left>Wondering how i would ever fit this large and ugly troll in the...borrowed...canoe, i set back to 
lead Bial to the poor aviak outpost. Finally spared of their company, and hoping i would not be
forced to ferry another friend...likely an ogre...i set back across the lake. I had only gone
halfway there when i heard a burbling cry of help and saw an unfortunate man being dragged 
under the waves by a pale greenish goblin. Heedless of my own safety, or my pressing engagement,
i dove in and tried to free the mage, but the goblin had dove too deep, and i felt my breath burning 
in me like a firey pain that spread from my chest. </p>

<p align=left>Gasping for air, i dragged my self into the canoe and, after a brief rest, rummaged around for my
songbook. (i can only remember so many songs at one time...and ihad not had call to use the
aquatic ayre or lyssa's locating lyric in a while) hoping that lumil would understand my absence,
i dove back into the dark depths after the poor corpse of Darellron. Aided by my song, which 
formed a magical bubble of air about my head, and by the sense of direction i gained from the 
locating lyric, i soon found the cave of the goblin.</p>

<p align=left>I placed my lightstone under my jerkin, dousing the light and plunging me into near darkness, where
i waited for the goblin to leave for other prey. Eventually i was able to swim unmolested into the
lair and found Darellron, unconscious and greatly bruised and bleeding, but alive. Luckily, he 
was a feeble mage and not a great, massive warrior and i was able to drag him out of the cave
and to the surface, where i played a restorative hymn until he was conscious. </p>

<p align=left>I was anxious to be off, so i refused payment and quickly paddled the hurt mage to shore.</p>

<p align=left>After much work, most to people i did not know or did not particulary like, (bial was not so bad,
he reminded me of oogle, but without oogle's childlike charm...must be a devotee of innoruk and
not of the spirit world like a true shaman) finally, i wearily got out of my boat, hid it in some 
bushes and trudged back to the vale where lumil waited impatiently.</p>

<p align=left>"Nice of you to return. did you find and interesting rock or something?"
Plopping down, i just shrugged.</p>

<p align=left>"well, i guess you can take a nap, since your obviously tired." Lumil graciously said, eyeing my
fatigued, blank stare.</p>

<p align=left>"bah, i can cure my fatigue easily with but a song. and i will rest after teh next battle." although
i did not plan on luring them the way i had earlier...much too tiring and suspensefull...although
it was invigorating...</p>

<p align=left>Lumil looked unhappy and said "Did you forget? the last patrol was due to pass by here an hour
ago. I think we missed this one."</p>

<p align=left>With a groan, I flopped back on the mossy ground and fell into a deep slumber, trusting the mage
to watch over my sleeping bardic self.</p>

<p align=left>From the personal memories of:</p>

<p align=left>Jediit of the Order.</p>
