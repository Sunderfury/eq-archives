<p align=left><b>Taken By The Night</b><br><i>by Greyhawk</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Beyond the mountains of the Lost Wish Range, a valley of hills emerged from the trees. The figure breathed deeply, sensing the shoreline in the distance none too far. Weary from his trek across the mountains, he sat to rest as the salty air inspired memories from his past. He could almost see a ship, sailing slowly through the mist. The memory was dim, but not forgotten as the ship carried voices in it's wake. Voices both friend and foe, that infused him with passion and tore at his heart. Voices he would cling to dearly, always. Suddenly feeling more than he could bear, the figure opened his eyes and continued down the rocky path.</p>

<p align=left>His destination soon became visable, as he passed the guard towers along the road. Long since empty, they remained more of a marker now, telling travellers that they had reached Castle Neydisa. Unharmed by the recent storm, Castle Neydisa stood as a majestic symbol of hope, far away from civilization. There was much life to be found beyond the bustling towns and villages, yet few dared travel so far. Those who did, had a reason more often than not, and did so because they had nowhere else to turn.</p>

<p align=left>The figure entered the castle unnoticed, as a visitor seeking shelter for the night. He marveled at the great stone walls and floors, wondering if he would ever call such a place his home. His entire life had been spent on the move or on the run, never content with his surroundings. Only now did he realize how much he longed for a place to call his own, somewhere secluded and safe. Down a hallway he continued, until he came upon a tall, slender figure dressed in white.</p>

<p align=left>"Welcome to Castle Neydisa, traveler," said the lady in white. "I am Tallial, and I am responsible for the upkeep of this peaceful settlement."</p>

<p align=left>"Well met m'lady," replied Orion Red with a slight bow. "Me name's Orion Red, and I ain't here to rob ye or nothin'. I heard that I could find me some Olde Ispar Stout in these parts."</p>

<p align=left>Lady Tallial smiled, but her look soon turned to that of confusion.</p>

<p align=left>"Orion, where have I heard your name before?" she questioned politely. "I can't seem to..."</p>

<p align=left>Orion suddenly felt uneasy and found himself trying to avoid eye contact.</p>

<p align=left>"Now I remember!" gasped Lady Tallial. "Were ye not banned from the town of Nanto?"</p>

<p align=left>"T'was just a slight misunderstandin' m'lady, I swear," answered Orion as he scratched his head. "They didn't give me much of a chance to explain meself."</p>

<p align=left>"Correct me if I'm wrong," said the lady as her voice grew stern. "Is there not a price on your head in Lytelthorpe as well?"</p>

<p align=left>Orion felt a lump in his throat as he tried to gather his thoughts.</p>

<p align=left>"T'was not my fault, I tell ye! I was just tryin' to comment a waitress on her dress, and the next thing I knew half the bar was throwin' punches at me."</p>

<p align=left>"Seems as though trouble lurks in your shadow," said Lady Tallial with a smile.</p>

<p align=left>"Methinks I'm cursed or somethin'," replied Orion as his head hung low, staring at the floor.</p>

<p align=left>Lady Tallial paused for a moment, sensing the distance in his voice.</p>

<p align=left>"As fine as it is, I do not believe ye travelled so far simply for the stout, aye?" she questioned with a whisper.</p>

<p align=left>Orion slowly lifted his head and gazed into her eyes. He could hear the voices inside him, struggling to escape. Fearing that he would reveal too much, Orion gritted his teeth and fought back the voices, denying their freedom and torturing his soul.</p>

<p align=left>"Ye are welcome to stay the night," Lady Tallial said softly as she placed her hand on his shoulder. "The spirit of Neydisa can reconcile that which troubles ye Orion, but ye must be willing to move on. Sleep well."</p>

<p align=left>Twilight fell and the castle grew silent. A lone figure stood in the tower, cloaked in a shimmer of blue light. Like a scene from a memory, he stared into the scarred palms of his hands, unleashing voices from his past. He could hear each one, as clear as the stars above him. With one last glance into the night, the figure whispered something heard by no one, and closed his eyes.</p>
