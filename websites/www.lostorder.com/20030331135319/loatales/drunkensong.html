<p align=left><b>Drunken Verses of Gratitude</b><br><i>by Orbison</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Things seemed rather bleak for me,<br> 
As I died in Paw just recently<br>
I nodded off there, among my friends<br>
But awoke much later to meet my end</p>

<p align=left>Then I was lost for many days<br>
Emerging slowly from my haze<br>
I found myself in Rivervale<br>
Brought back to life by the smell of ale</p>

<p align=left>I quickly ran through many zones<br>
Past Kithicor Woods, and Highhold's stones<br>
And down the pass into the plain<br>
Evading griffins with disdain</p>

<p align=left>And back at Paw, I made my plea<br>
For any guildmate to aid me<br>
And though he was about to rest<br>
Aanlain answered my request</p>

<p align=left>He ventured deep into that hole<br>
Fending off some deadly gnolls<br>
And pulled my corpse back up to me<br>
Allowing for my recovery</p>

<p align=left>I gave him an ale, in gratitude<br>
Applauded his helpful attitude<br>
But that taste of ale made him think<br>
Of going to Halas for a drink</p>

<p align=left>So with a wave of his arms he cast a spell<br>
That took us from that gnollish hell<br>
And sent us back out to the plains<br>
My head was dizzy from the strain</p>

<p align=left>Once my mind was no longer numb<br>
He bade me to equip my drum<br>
And as I sang my song of speed<br>
We departed for Halas, him in the lead</p>

<p align=left>Through many zones, we crossed quite fast<br>
Emerging in the north at last<br>
I stood there, awestruck by the sight<br>
Of mountains and valleys, covered in white</p>

<p align=left>He lead me then, up to a town<br>
A city with tall people gathered around<br>
Twas Halas at last, after coming so far<br>
I was indeed ready to locate a bar</p>

<p align=left>Once in the tavern, he again honored me<br>
With many bottles of warm brandy<br>
And soon enough my speech was slurred<br>
My stance was stumbling and vision blurred</p>

<p align=left>And as I played a drunken rhyme<br>
He noticed a woman named Thadres Thyme<br>
But as he inquired of her past and her quest<br>
She suddenly became distressed</p>

<p align=left>She attacked us both, and we had to run<br>
Suddenly the brandy wasn't much fun<br>
I slipped in the snow and often fell down<br>
Scrambling to reach the edge of town</p>

<p align=left>Across the lake once again, Aanlain and I<br>
Breathed an icy collective sigh<br>
That woman, it seemed, had no use for jest<br>
So he bid me farewell and sat down to rest</p>

<p align=left>I then waved goodbye, and thanked him again<br>
Our little adventure had come to an end<br>
I found peace at last, by that icy cold lake<br>
But dreaded the hangover with which I'd awake.</p>
