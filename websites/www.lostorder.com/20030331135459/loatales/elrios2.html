<p align=left><b>The Night Shift</b><br><i>by Elrios</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It was a night like all others, but someone was out on his boat, breaking the calm ocean waters.</p>

<p align=left>"'eres the map, set sail to Golgothia, I wanna get some ice feinds!!!" Elrios said in a tough-sounding voice.</p>

<p align=left>"Why do we 'afta go so late at night?" pondered the tillerman in a sleepy voice.</p>

<p align=left>"I 'ave me reasons." sighed Elrios lightly.</p>

<p align=left>"Alright sir... going to ice isle."</p>

<p align=left>After two hours of sailing, the tillerman sighted land.</p>

<p align=left>"Land ho!!"</p>

<p align=left>Elrios stood only to be knocked back down down again by a wave crashing onto the deck.</p>

<p align=left>"What the..." said Elrios trying to stand.</p>

<p align=left>After the waves calmed down, Elrios began searching the sides of the vessel.</p>

<p align=left>"What 'appened?!" said Elrios.</p>

<p align=left>"Don't know sir, but we best be moving."</p>

<p align=left>The ship began moving, but then abruptly stopped.</p>

<p align=left>"Sir, something's wrong, we stopped at fu..."</p>

<p align=left>The tillerman was interrupted by a loud screaching follwed by a crashing that tore the boat apart.</p>

<p align=left>"AHHHHHH!!!!" shouted the tillerman before being swallowed by a large snake-like creature.</p>

<p align=left>After a few seconds Elrios grabbed a peice of his ruined boat and began swimming his hardest the rest of the way towards shore. When Elrios reached, he climbed up and began to look at the destroyed boat, seeing a pair of silver fins glistening in the moonlight... and began wandering the shore. After hours of wandering, the sky began to lighten up to a grey.</p>

<p align=left>"God damnit..." Elrios muttered.</p>

<p align=left>Elrios began to run his fastest to a cliff he had seen earlier and began frantically clawing that the rocks in attempts to find some sort of crevace to hide behind for the day. After pushing a bit, a part of the wall crumbled to reveal a cave.</p>

<p align=left>"...thank God." said Elrios with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p align=left>Elrios began walking deeper in the cave. Curiosity seemed to have gotten the better of him. Towards the end of the cave, Elrios stepped into a large opeing which seemed to be a cavern of sorts, and peers at men working and loading large crates on boats. Watching the men, Elrios got a little closer to try and hear something. When examining the cavern, there was no entrances or exits making Elrios wonder how they got in.</p>

<p align=left>"IDIOTS!!!! Yarp wanted the arrmows on number one and the regs on two!!" shouted the man which must be of highest command.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye aye, sir!!!" shouted the men followed by grumbling.</p>

<p align=left>"OES..?" thought Elrios.</p>

<p align=left>When the men were finished loading the crates on the ships, they set raised anchor and started heading towards a cavern wall.</p>

<p align=left>"They're suicidal." Elrios thought grinning.</p>

<p align=left>While watching the boats sail to their demise, the suddenly disapeared through the wall.</p>

<p align=left>"...things are jes gettin' weirder an' weirder..." thought Elrios standing "What magic be this?"</p>

<p align=left>After looking around a bit, the ships returned and Elrios ran back behind a rock. The men all filed off the boats and headed out the other side of the cavern saying "Arr!! I hate these OES for makin' us work all day!" said one.</p>

<p align=left>"What time is it anyway?" said a man that sounded to be of rich stature.</p>

<p align=left>"Don't know, past sundown, I know that much." replyed number one, dissapearing like all the rest out the far end of the cavern.</p>

<p align=left>"Good, now I can leave an' report this to Noci." whispered Elrios.</p>

<p align=left>After raising an anchor to one of the boats, Elrios began towards the wall that the other ships had sailed through.</p>

<p align=left>"...may Reminisence save me..." whispered Elrios once more before vanishing. </p>
