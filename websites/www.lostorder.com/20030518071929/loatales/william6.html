<p align=left><b>Victory and Defeat</b><br><i>by William</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The story begins as so many do of late...</p>

<p align=left>"Yew is uder attack!" came the shotued warning from the front of Empath Abbey. With a sigh that speaks of countless battles, William drew his Katana free of its sheath, and spurred his steed towards the front of the Abbey.</p>

<p align=left>As he closed with the doorway his eyes widened in surprise. Instead of the expected Orcs and Mongbats, he saw a half dozen floating Orbs. "Gazers?" William thought. "How odd" Nevertheless there was battle to be done so forward he charged his Destrier into their midst, swinging away with his blade.</p>

<p align=left>A few minutes later, he had fought his way to the town center to find his once wife Tara in desperate battle with a number of the beasts. William smiled to himself as he cast the energies for a Greater Healing spell. Even though she had turned from the light, she was still a fierce warrior. He could hardly believe a Halberd could be wielded with such speed. Through years of practice, William and Tara defeated the Gazers with nary a word spoken twixt them. No matter what else - they made a good pair.</p>

<p align=left>Peering across the landscape of Yew, William saw movement on the battlements of the distant Hall of Justice. "I think there is more to this attack than what was here, Tara. We should proceed to the Hall of Justice." With some unheard curse spoken about "Justice," Tara whipped up her Halberd and took off at full speed towards the Hall with William on her heels.</p>

<p align=left>Sure enough, the Paladin's instincts were correct. Gazers floated all over the Hall, waiting for any who dare approach. "For the Shard and the Tome!" came the shout from William's throat as he charged headlong into the masses. Again several minutes of fierce battle all around the building and even inside the hall itself took place. As before, the might of the warriors assembled overcame the darkness and the monsters were vanquished.</p>

<p align=left>William did not look pleased however. "No," he muttered "there is something afoot here.." A few seconds later a look of understanding appeared on his face. "The Jail... The orc..." he whispered. Then with a shout, he spurred Honor, his faithful steed to a full gallop up the stairs and onto the causeways that lead to the prison. The resistance was present but easily overcome by the Paladin and his shadowy companion. After only a minute they had arrived at the Yew Prison. Tara and William both rushed down the stairs headlong.</p>

<p align=left>"You are too late!" came an shriek that set William's teeth on edge. "Kal Vas Flam!" followed quickly behind. As the flames erupted from beneath Tara's feet Willaim grabbed the components and countered with his own In Vas Mani on his once wife. "Since when do gazers actually speak the wrods of power?" shouted Will. "Only when its Kaltar!" came the slightly panicked reply.</p>

<p align=left>With that revelation, Will quickly assessed his opponents and saw among the dozen or so Gazers one that was an particularly unpleasent golden color. "Oh Crap! Fall back Tara - back upstairs"</p>

<p align=left>As they ran back to the room above, Will grabbed for reagents in his bag. A despereate ploy, but one that had worked before. As he began to chant the waords of power Kaltar and his hoard floated silently up the steps. More gazers appeared out of this air behind the couple, cutting them of from safety. "Whatever you're doing, Do it FAST!" growled Tara as she took a defensive posture guarding the concentrating Paladin.</p>

<p align=left>"Vas Rel Por!" A blue pulsing Gateway Sprang into the world at Will's feet. "Running away, Paladin?" Tara mocked. "Not quite" replied William with a small smile playeing upon his lips.</p>

<p align=left>The Paladin's faith was not misplaced. A small Army of the Lost Order of Akalabeth poured through the gateway into the midst of the fray. He had hoped they had heard of the attack and would know ehat the sudden appearance of his gate meant. With grim satisfaction he returned to the battle as his brethren charged forward uttering Words of Power and swinging steel with deadly accuracy. Step by step the Order pushed downwards. Occasiionally the Shrieking Kaltar could be heard taunting the warriors shouting "You are Too Late!"</p>

<p align=left>As the figthing continued reinforcements appeared from all over Yew. Clan Moor, the Yew Miltia and others joined the fracas. Kaltar must have realised that he would not survive were he to stay as he soundlessly vanished without a trace. Williams Bardiche cut through the air Kaltar had occupied a split second ago. "DAMN!" he cursed. He had hoped to rid the world of that monstosity, or at least take it prisoner for the Yew Council. "A fine lesson in humilty" he decided and snapped his attention back to the remaining gazers.</p>

<p align=left>Without their leader they were easily overcome, but twas a mixed blessing. Though the gazer invasion was turned back, Kaltar had achieved the objective he had so obviously come for. The Orc prisoner was gone. Sprung from his jail and doubtlessly spirited away on black wings of Kaltar's evil magic. "Another day, Kaltar..." William mutterd to himself. "Another day..."</p>
