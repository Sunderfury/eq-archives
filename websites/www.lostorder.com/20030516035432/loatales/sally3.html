<p align=left><b>Sally's Disappointment</b><br><i>by Sally</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Jared my love,</p>

<p align=left>I have given it me all to become a good, honest seamstress…but I am afraid tis not to be. I have had a great disappointment yesterday. I went to the Fleet house to present Officer Noc the new uniform that I made for him and had hoped to make for all of the fleet and this is what happened:</p>

<p align=left>I was so proud of the lovely new yellow uniform that I made for the Fleet that I hurried to the Fleet House to see Officer Noc. Lord Ni’vek said yellow was Noci’s favorite color. I knocked on the door and was in luck…Officer Noc was home. He greeted me with open arms and said “Hello Sally dear…. What do you have behind your back lass?” I then proudly handed him my uniform that I had made for him. Noxicel being the kind soul that he is, manage to smile at me even though the uniform looked like something that a “working girl” would have worn. “Well lass I see you have been busy and this is..er..um…very lovely. What is it?”</p>

<p align=left>“It’s the fleet’s new uniform,” I said with a smile. Now maybe there is a strange sickness going around because when Officer Noc saw the uniform he got pale…the same way the kind Widow Harris had when she opened the door to me. What Officer Noc said next I did not understand too well… I did hear him say he was going to have to get someone about the color…and something about needing a drink. I just smiled at him because it would have been rude to admit I did not know what he was muttering about. So I asked Officer Noc if he was going to try on the new uniform. He went and got a bottle of ale and drank straight from the bottle and then said “Aye..Lass I guess I will”.</p>

<p align=left>Noc looked at the pile of clothes and shakes his head. He went ahead and decided that he would start with the yellow shirt first. He put his left arm into the sleeve, but it could only go half way in..it appears that the lower end of the sleeve was three sizes smaller than the upper half. Noc then noticed that the shirt had three buttons and six buttonholes. “Well Lass, I guess I won’t be wearing this shirt,” he said to himself. Noc next picked up the pants and noticed that there was three pant legs. Noc said “Good Lord child, with all of ye experience I would have thought you would have known a man’s body by now”. Noc quickly put the pants aside. Next he picked up the kilt. He was able to wear the kilt, but did not understand the reasons for the slits on the side. The last two items were the sash, which was four times larger than any he had ever seen, and it hung down past his knees. To finish this ensemble Noc placed the yellow hat with a large purple feather in it on his head. Noc then quickly prayed that no other LOA member would see him dressed like this. “Okay Lass it’s on me” Noc sighed.</p>

<p align=left>He did not have to say anything…he was dressed like me old boy friend Mick who used to offer my services to others. “Officer Noc, you don’t have to wear that outfit…. I am going back to me old ways…I will never be a proper lady for my Jared”. Noc quickly came up with a suggestion…”Now Sally lass don’t be too quick. granted you are not much of a seamstress but there are other skills you might be good at….I….I.. Believe that Attrael might need some kitchen help over there at the Brewman. You might go over there and see if the BattleChef will teach you the trade of being a chef”. Noc Smiled. “ Oh Officer Noc…thank ye..I will become a cook”</p>

<p align=left>So you see Jared, even though being a seamstress did not work out..I am sure I will become the best chef in Yew and then become a proper lady for you.</p>
