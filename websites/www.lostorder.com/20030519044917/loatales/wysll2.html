<p align=left><b>Journal - Day Two</b><br><i>by Wysll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Woke up this morning to find most of my brothers gone. I went down to the innkeeper, who (rather rudely) told me that Wyll had requested another room in the night. Well, I can't blame him...I almost did myself to get away from Wyndelle's snoring. Went up to Wyll's room and found him just getting up. He said he had had a restless night - no wonder after yesterday's events.</p>

<p align=left>We all found each other then - apparently the rest had gone out for a morning stroll. I wish I had more time in Felwithe. Even though the high elves treat us like we are vermin, the stonework in their city is inspired. Brell blessed the ones who did this work, methinks.</p>

<p align=left>We immediately tried various guilds around town, finding no success. The elves ignored us, as if we were beneath contempt. My rage built, but I was determined not to let it get the best of me. If we were to find aid here, an outburst would do us no good - and might doom our search before it was started.</p>

<p align=left>After a few failures, we tried the Wizard's guild. One would think that the brotherhood of Wizards would welcome one of its own, but the elves value race above art, I think. We met with a lady called Naddia, who deigned to help us - but for a price.</p>

<p align=left>She 'required' 3 bone chips from undead pawns. Her supplier had failed, and she was in a bind. We told her we would return with them, and left the building with her insults ringing in our ears.</p>

<p align=left>Just remember Wysll - you're doing this for your family...</p>

<p align=left>The undead pawns proved no match for our group. With 2 Wizards, a magician, a rogue (as irritating as Wyxle can be, he's my brother and I love him), and a warrior, the abominations quickly fell to our attacks.</p>

<p align=left>As we returned to Felwithe, I dreaded our encounter with Naddia. Better to be ignored than insulted... Unfortunately, she surpassed my expectations. Treating the parchment from Wyll as if it did not have anything of import, she said it was gibberish - as if that were our fault. Then she tried to cast a spell of understanding on the page.</p>

<p align=left>(When I studied with Useah, he told me that those spells almost always have some deleterious effect on the caster. Sure, you get the info, but you usually end up paying for it. Why do you think I haven't tried that myself? The effect is probably proportional to the import of the information...judging from Naddia's reaction.)</p>

<p align=left>She shuddered violently, and cried out in pain...then fell into a trance and spoke these words. (I wrote them down, as I purchased a parchment in the market this morning. With everyone and their mothers speaking prophecy, I thought it might come in handy.)</p>

<p align=left>Wind blown and battered the Balanced One finds Light<br>
Truth pierces the gloom, Love destroys the Shadows<br>
And with clarity in heart and soul she weds the champion<br>
Who banished the Whirlwind from her life</p>

<p align=left>After many seasons of peace and happiness,<br>
The West wind builds once again.<br>
Through capture and deception the Dark deed is done.<br>
The mother's blood runs true and pure in a bed of sorrow.</p>

<p align=left>A gust from the West carries the cry of a newborn babe.<br>
From the East blows a wind to counter the other.<br>
Seasons pass and the Whirlwinds form anew -<br>
The Dark and Light choose a new balance around which to dance.</p>

<p align=left>Okay...I'm seeing some themes here, but how does this apply to the 'darkest Walaryn' that the old wizard spoke of? We're getting more information, but not much in the way of answers.</p>

<p align=left>Of course, after the trance wore off, Naddia was blaming us for giving her such a 'dangerous' document to translate. (Serves her right for blindly casting that spell..)</p>

<p align=left>Then she did something totally unexpected...she mentioned our father.</p>

<p align=left>For the longest time, we thought our father dead. In fact, our uncle Wyndsor has told us so on many occasions. Now we find out from a rude elf that our father lived in Felwithe for a time? (He must be a saint - how else could he spend so much time among these haughty people?) </p>

<p align=left>She told us he was doing some research there - she could only assume it was of this prophecy - and left for the Ocean of Tears.</p>

<p align=left>There really wasn't any discussion on what to do next. We all knew that we had no choice but to follow him. I'm trying not to let hope grow in my heart - after all this time, it is doubtful that our father lives...</p>

<p align=left>We literally missed the boat when we arrived at the Butcherblock docks. As it was getting late by this time, we decided to camp at the port authority and make the trip tomorrow.</p>

<p align=left>I'm still unsettled - every step we take seems to throw another spanner in the sprockets. And my lack of sleep isn't helping any. Now I've got to contend with a trip over water tomorrow! Brell surely meant us to tunnel under the sea, as true Gnomes should.</p>

<p align=left>But there's no sense in wishing for something that will never be. As my grandmother used to say, "Want in one hand..."</p>

<p align=left>Brell keep us all tomorrow. I think we'll need his protection.</p>
