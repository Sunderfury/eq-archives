<p align=left><b>A Metal Knight's Lament</b><br><i>by Navrip</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A body of iron, bolts, and steel;<br>
arms, legs, nerves that don't feel.<br>
What I once possessed has left;<br>
fled to nether realms I no longer see.<br>
Some people say they feel pity,<br>
some people say they grieve,<br>
others say they hate me.<br>
I care not for what they say.<br>
I am inhuman and stay that way.</p>

<p align=left>Cold reason and logic are my mind;<br>
good emotion is hard to find.<br>
Lacking a feeling heart<br>
I do what I please with no remorse.<br>
I may seem cruel but I am not<br>
I just am what I was made;<br>
a perfection of monstrosity.<br>
People can say I dim the light<br>
but I’ll do that to further might.</p>

<p align=left>There is an empty hole <br>
in the place where should be my soul.<br>
I lost it long ago when I was unaware.<br>
But give me the chance to change fate<br>
and I’d do it the same all again.<br>
Love, joy, happiness no longer matter.<br>
I ask myself what does it all mean,<br>
but I realize that I live but for one thing -<br>
My Queen.</p>
