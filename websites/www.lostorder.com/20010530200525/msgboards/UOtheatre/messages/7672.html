<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">Crystal stood at the stable doors... a single tear rolling down her cheek... the day had finally come that had been foretold by the "gods"... she would no longer be able to keep her companions with her, but must set them free and pray they survived in the wild, how could she choose which of her dear trusted friends she would keep, the minutes crawled by like hours, as she brushed, petted and hugged each companion in turn, finally choosing the ones that had been with her the longest and putting them back into the care of the stable hand who quietly stood off in the corner trying to give her some privacy  ... she tried to calm herself, her companions sensing her sadness were beginning to stir,  with a strength of will Crystal opened a magical portal to place that was quiet, filled with grass and flowers... softly petting each one, whispering softly in each ear a final farewell, she managed to whisper the words that must be spoken...a sob catching in her throat  each time it was spoken... "all release"    Her companions at first were confused, yet quiet, and for a few long silent moments she looked into the eyes of each one, for one last final moment of goodbye... slowly each one turned and began to wander off exploring their new home... the tears flowing freely down her cheeks Crystal Rose managed to open the portal again, this time back to her home, where she ran to her bedchamber, locking the door behind her and let the tears of sorrow flow freely...knowing that a part of her heart would always be with each one of her companions no matter where they may roam.</font>
