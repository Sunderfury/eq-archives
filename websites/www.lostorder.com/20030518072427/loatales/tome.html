<p align=left><b>LOA's First Reading from the Oracular Tome</b><br><i>by Calan</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Brothers and Sisters of the Order,</p>

<p align=left>Many ages ago it came to pass that the Order of Akalabeth found itself in exile from Sosaria, and as is told elsewhere, they made for themselves a new home in a new land. In this new land they awaited the Return of the Order to their rightful place in Sosaria. This time of Return is known as the Time of Heroes. To prepare for this time the greatest of the Architects prepared a primer for the use by the future generations of the Order. This primer became known as the Oracular Tome, for it held many prophecies, and it was intended to guide the Order through the many travails and trials that lay before them which, alas, would be many.</p>

<p align=left>But the Architects also bid the Order to remember that in the darkest of times they should look upon the Shard of Light to provide aid and succor.</p>

<p align=left>So wrote the Architects in the Oracular Tome:</p>

<p align=left>"Beware ye of the Order, for evil things shall play upon the land in Great Number, and they shall assail the strongholds of the Light. And these strongholds shall become few in number, for Evil is known to wear a face of great Beauty and Power, and many shall fall to it's Bewitching Might.</p>

<p align=left>But when the sky does appear at it's most dark, look ye of the Faithful to the Shard of Light, for it shall provide ye with what ye need to stand fast. When the Shadows seem at their longest and most powerful, and ye are beset by enemies on all sides, then the Shard of Light shall provide the Order with Guardians to protect ye. They shall be created out of the light that does fill the Shard, and they shall stand as a beacon of Hope to the Forces of Virtue.</p>

<p align=left>These Guardians shall give completely of themselves to shield ye of the Faithful and to defend the Order, and they shall feel death many times, yet they shall not expire in truth, for they are one with the Light. To some, they shall be reviled as Murderers, and then they shall be hunted even by the soldiers of the King himself, for they shall know not whence they have come, nor their purpose. But the Guardians shall forever faithfully serve ye of the Order, and shall never falter. Cherish these Guardians in your hearts, for they are gifts from the Shard of Light."</p>

<p align=left>So wrote the Architects in the Tome.</p>

<p align=left>And now my brothers and sisters, in this time of our great need, as is foretold by the Tome, we now see new Guardians come to take up the rod of protection. Hearken to them when ye see them for they are created by the Shard of Light to serve the Order.</p>
