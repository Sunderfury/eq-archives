<p align=left><b>From Dracherio's Journal: Kerra Isle</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It has been a long time since I wrote anything upon these pages. The bridge of bones, which once filled me with such apprehension, is now merely a large white plank across a wide river. I have been to the other side. I know where the kobolds live; I have fought them more times than I can remember. I know where the Heretics hide; I have spent long hours studying their scrolls and tomes. I have seen the tunnel that bores into the heart of the southern mountain, a passageway which supposedly leads to the ruins of Paineel, where the final battle was fought between the wizards of Light and Darkness, leaving behind an epic crater of destruction known only as the Hole. Toxxulia has become familiar to me; all its secrets have been laid bare. I no longer feel as though I am trespassing here; indeed, I feel as though the forest has accepted me as one of her own. Every valley, every hill, every fallen log – they are now my landmarks, and even in the darkest night I can find my way.</p>

<p align=left>Strange, is it not, that we always hunger for more? Sometimes I envy those who are able to settle down in one place, enjoying a safe, comfortable life. But that life is not for me. I thirst to see new lands, to acquire new knowledge; it is a thirst that I suspect will never be sated.</p>

<p align=left>So I turned my eyes westward toward the one place on Odus I had not yet seen: Kerra Isle.</p>

<p align=left>Early that morning I arrived at the old pier. The river was shrouded in mist, as always. And as always, my thoughts were a turbulent mixture of curiosity and trepidation as I prepared to venture forth into the unknown.</p>

<p align=left>I waded out past the pier, noting the small fish that darted and zipped about. But what if there were bigger fish out there, in the deeper parts of the water? Could there be sharks, or crocodiles – or worse? Well, I would soon find out. I had my spells; hopefully they would be enough to defend me. Taking a deep breath, I submerged beneath the waves.</p>

<p align=left>Let it be noted here that I do not like the water. It is cold and dark – and often full of predators more suited to aquatic travel than I am. I did not encounter any such predators that morning – but if I had, I would have been hard-pressed to avoid becoming a meal for them.</p>

<p align=left>I swam for a long time, and I began to wonder if the island really existed. After all, I had really only heard vague rumors and legends. Could I be searching in the wrong place? But I kept going – and before long, I saw land up ahead.</p>

<p align=left>My first impression of Kerra Isle was one of desolation. Bleak, barren rocks stretched for miles in two directions, north and south, comprising a vast mountainous wall. I truly felt as though I was standing at the western edge of the world – a bitter, lonely place of emptiness and crashing waves.</p>

<p align=left>The old map I had purchased was somewhat cryptic, full of strange icons described by a cryptic ancient language that I could only partially decipher. But it led me to believe that there was some sort of temple to the south. So southward I went, and after a mile or so, I beheld a rather impressive construction. Towering into the fog above me stood a gargantuan gateway. It was crudely fashioned from rough-hewn granite, perhaps the work of some primitive, ancient race. A tunnel yawned open from its base, and I could see that it led deeper into the mountain. There was no evidence of life, and I could have believed that no one had been here in centuries, were it not for the two braziers that guarded the tunnel entrance, their flames flickering and sputtering in the moaning wind.</p>

<p align=left>Slowly, I entered the tunnel. I was nervous, of course – but that nervousness was no match for the sheer excitement of this, a new discovery in my travels. This was something I had never seen before, and I was imbued with that heady exhilaration which greets all explorers when they stand at last upon the verge of the Unknown.</p>

<p align=left>By the light of the fire beetle eye that I held before me, I could discern what appeared to be claw marks upon the walls. Who or what had made them was a supposition delegated to my roiling imagination. The scarred tunnel went on for quite some time, finally opening up onto a wide ledge.</p>

<p align=left>I had not gone more than three steps, when all of a sudden the night was filled with terrible, shrieking cries. My eyes strove to pierce the gloom, and I thought I could see eyes – a forest of gleaming yellow eyes glaring at me from the inky depths of the night. And they were all rushing toward me.</p>

<p align=left>My reason fled from me, as a shadow before a bright lantern. I felt claws digging into my side, tearing at my clothes, scratching the vulnerable flesh beneath. If you were to forcefully drag a sharp rock across your skin, you would know what one of their talons felt like. Now, multiply the number of sharp rocks, and imagine them slicing into you from every direction, all over your body – that begins to describe the searing whirlwind of teeth and claws that had suddenly surrounded me.</p>

<p align=left>As I turned to run toward the tunnel, I felt sure that I was going to die. Poets and playwrights have embellished it far too much. My life did not ‘pass before my eyes’. I did not suddenly wish that I had lived my life differently. There wasn’t even any sense of disappointment that I was dying here, like this, in a dark and lonely place. My thoughts were fixed and frozen in a grim determination to reach that tunnel, to somehow evade my tormentors.</p>

<p align=left>I ran as fast as I could. The walls of the tunnel were a blur to my pain-dimmed senses. My eyes swam in red, and I could barely keep myself from stumbling and dropping to the ground. At last the tunnel ended, and I stood facing the dark river. This was the end. Even if I had had the strength to swim, I could not have made it all the way back to the other side without drowning. So I turned around, steeling myself for a final confrontation that could only have one ending.</p>

<p align=left>And I blinked a couple of times. Were my eyes playing tricks on me? For the desolate shore was empty. Of my pursuers there was not a sign. It was as if they had melted back into the shadows of the tunnel. Primitive superstition, perhaps? Were they afraid to cross the boundary between their world and mine?</p>

<p align=left>I did not ponder why. With trembling fingers, I bandaged the worst of my wounds as well as I could. Then I spent a few nervous minutes huddling next to the fire, resting myself for the journey back.</p>

<p align=left>Three days later, now, and most of the scars have healed. I have spent my time with the Heretics, learning more of their dark lore, preparing myself for the day when I will return to that dark shore at the western edge of the world, and stand face to face with the savage creatures that haunt Kerra Isle.</p>
