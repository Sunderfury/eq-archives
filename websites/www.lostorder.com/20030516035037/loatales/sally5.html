<p align=left><b>SOS Sally</b><br><i>by Sally</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Jared my love I bet you have wondered where I have been. Well I have been away at sea. Yes love you heard it right I have been at sea…no, I have not become a sailor…in fact I would be very happy if I never saw another boat for the rest of me life.</p>

<p align=left>My adventure at sea began the day after the holidays when I returned back to the Brewman’s Tavern just as Sir Attrael had said to start training as a battle chef. So I waited several hours and Attrael never came. I was sitting in the tavern all sad and thought I might as well go back to me old ways…..Jared my love…I have been ever so lonely….I even miss me sister Daisy. Well about that time Captain Carl came into the tavern and he too was looking for Attrael. He said he needed Attrael to cook for his crew they were about to set sail for the new lands. Well I told him I was Attrael’s student Battle Chef. He look at me with his one good eye and said,” Lass if you can cook as well as ye look you have a job”. Well he made me so happy that I took the job.</p>

<p align=left>I arrived at his ship “The SeaWench” at sunrise. To be honest love it wasn’t much of a boat…it was rather small and very dirty and his crew…well let’s just say for them to spend so much of their time on water I do not know how they have never had any water on them. Anyway, Captain Carl led me to me quarters. I t was very small but at least it had a bed and a lock on the door so I was happy..it was just next to the kitchen. We soon set sail for the open sea…..well I had forgotten to tell Captain Carl that I have never sailed before….so I spent the first three days in my bed next to me bucket…if you know what I mean.</p>

<p align=left>On the fourth day I got me sea legs and began me new career as a ship’s cook. Well I wasn’t too sure how to use the stove so until I could figure it out I feed the crew peanut butter sandwiches for every meal for the next week until the peanut butter and bread ran out. Captain Carl was very kind when he approach me and said, “ Lass if you feed me men one more peanut butter sandwich they will feed ye to the sharks.” So I knew from that point on what I had to do…I had to use the stove.</p>

<p align=left>I looked at the stove for a very long time…not very sure how to even light the thing. I opened the iron door on the front of the stove and started filling it all the way with wood. Once I could not get any more wood into the stove I saw a box of oily rags that the crew uses to keep the ropes oiled so they slide easy. I took the oily rags and shoved them into all of the empty space that was left in the stove and then I saw a can of oil and I pour the whole can inside the stove. I was ready to light the stove. I placed the oil can on top of the stove and did not notice it was leaking a bit. Just as I lit the match I remembered that I forgot to ask him what he wanted me to cook. I thought I had put the match out ..but it was still warm and I laid it on the stove next to the oil can as I ran up the stairs.</p>

<p align=left>I had just gotten to the deck when….BOOM…there was an explosion</p>

<p align=left>Everyone was running back and forth as the ship was sinking fast. Captain Carl grab me and threw me in a life boat with him. He said,” If I am going to be shipwreck because of ye…then I am going to make the best of it. Well let me tell you love….being in a lifeboat is very different than being on a ship…I got sick again….many times…to the point where even Captain Carl got sick and he even jumped overboard and said, “ I ‘ll rather take me chances with the sharks than spend another day with you.” </p>

<p align=left>Poor Captain Carl…I never saw him again. About two hours after he left a fishing boat came by and picked me up and brought me back to Yew. Well me love I guess I need to find another career I am not going to be a battle chef again…..Perhaps I can check and see if that kind Mister Broog needs some help in the Ironworks…I do remember there was a help wanted sign posted there a few weeks ago.</p>

<p align=left>Until I see you the next time..I send you Jared all my love.</p>
