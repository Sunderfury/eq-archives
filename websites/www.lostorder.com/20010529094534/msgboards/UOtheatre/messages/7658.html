<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">Crow was huddled in a dark stairwell, thankful for the secrecy it provided as much as for the shelter from the bitter autumn evening. Things had gone as he had planned. They usually did. He had spent the past two months with the group of assassins known as the Cloaked Fist. To them, he had appeared to be an eager student and they had seemed very pleased with his quick aptitude. Crow had been careful to hide his great skill from them, revealing a little of his ability at a time so they would be convinced that he was making progress due to their lessons. He had especially enjoyed their instruction in the art of the sword. As a young man, the sword had been his weapon of choice. He rarely used a blade anymore, but he still held a mastery over the forms and he delighted in the physicality of their practices. Slowly he gained their confidence, learning of their deadly tactics and their despicable purpose. The Cloaked Fist existed to murder carefully selected nobles in the hopes that the strife would topple British from power. As experienced as he was, Crow did learn a new trick or two during his time with the Fist. All of the assassins were heavily trained in the use of poison. Juman, the wizened old alchemist who owned the shop that served as their hideout, knew of components to add to the reagents in the magical poison spell. Instead of the nausea that most mages could inflict upon their opponents, Juman’s methods could create a poison spell that could literally kill a man. As much as Crow hated to admit it, Juman was a talented and gracious teacher, so he took great care to learn as much as he could from the aged man. The King’s Hand was careful to study and practice these methods in secret though, lest the others find out that he was actually skilled in the magical arts. When he had mastered these new skills and he had gathered the evidence necessary, he was ready to conclude his task. As a member of the King’s Hand, Crow was instructed to infiltrate and apprehend criminal threats to the realm. Per the King’s wishes, he was dutybound to make an attempt at bringing his targets in for a fair trial. He was, however, authorized to use deadly force if his targets attempted to overpower him rather than follow him to Yew. Crow preferred it much better when they resisted. Not because of any sick or secret thrill he felt when harming another person, but simply because it was just so much...easier.<p><br>************<p><br>He had taken Jack Tate out first. After a card game and one too many ales on Jack’s part, Crow had informed him of who he really worked for. Jack immediately sought to overpower his former student, nearly slicing Crow’s stomach open with his poisoned cutlass. Crow had barely managed to dodge the blow and Jack had seemed quite startled when Crow had unleashed the power of his deadly magic upon him. Tate died with the hauntingly familiar mix of confusion and hatred on his face. It was a look that Crow had seen a hundred times before. The King’s Hand waited three days before he took Lindred Filk. The hulking Filk was a far more dangerous warrior than Jack Tate, but in the end, he chose to fight and he fell just the same. The Fist became very agitated after Filk turned up missing. They were desperate to find out what had happened to their soldiers but they could find out nothing. Things only got worse for them two days later when Crow himself disappeared. Before he vanished, the King’s Hand was careful to plant a few clues behind to convince the Fist that he had been attacked and taken like the others. Once he was “dead” to the Cloaked Fist, Crow could work much faster. He knew their habits, their homes and their haunts. They began travelling together in small groups, but even that could not save them from Crow’s skill at dispensing justice. It did not take him long to near the end of his task and only one member of the Fist remained. Huddled and freezing in a dank stairway, Crow hoped this evening would be the last. Hours had passed when finally he saw Juman, the last remaining member of the Cloaked Fist, close the door to his shop and begin walking up the cemetery road. Juman did not move more than a few steps when he stopped, turned his head and spoke in a more or less resigned voice. “You can come out now, whoever you are. I am too slow to run and I am too old to fight.”<br>Normally Crow would not have risen to the bait, but for some reason, tonight he did. “Greetings Juman, please stay where you are sir.” The King’s Hand spoke with no hint of the more primitive accent he had used these past months.<br>Juman took notice, “Crow, I see your speech has improved.”<br>Crow had to hand it to him, if Juman was surprised to see him he did not show it. “You know why I have come then Juman?”<br>The ancient assassin nodded, “I know why you have come. It is, most unfortunately for me, to kill me. What I would like to know is on whose behalf you have come to end my life.”<br>Crow answered calmly, “I am here as the King’s Hand. I have come to take you to Yew where you will face justice for the crimes against our people.” <br>“I see. And what if I do not wish to go?” The alchemist still appeared nonplussed, and for once Crow hoped that his target would actually agree to be captured. Crow’s only answer was a sad smile and Juman nodded. “Yes, I see.” Juman looked down briefly before calmly sitting cross-legged in the middle of the road. The old man reached into his robes and Crow made ready to speak words of power when he saw Juman’s hand emerge with a small vial. “I’m afraid I’d rather not travel with you this evening master Crow. If you’ll excuse me?” With that Juman drank his vial, closed his eyes and slumped back onto the dirt road. It took only seconds before his heaving chest stopped its spastic rising and falling. With the old man’s last breath, Crow’s mission was over. The Cloaked Fist was no more. <p><br>**********<p>(To be continued...)<p><p></font>
