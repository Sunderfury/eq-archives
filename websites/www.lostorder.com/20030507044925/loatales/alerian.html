<p align=left><b>Rebirth</b><br><i>by Alerian</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Alerian strolled through the strolled through the springtime flora that had replaced the chilling snow of winter. Since his great journey began, this was the first time he had returned to Holtburg. Yet he snuck about the cabins lying near the southern outpost, keeping his disguise as weary adventurer. Well, the adventurer was indeed an illusion -- The weariness had become quite a reality. Upon arriving at the pyramidal structure, he paused to survey the terrain to ensure he had not been recognized nor followed. Seeing no person suspicious, he darted through the entryway and into the darkness within.</p>

<p align=left>The wizened sage that sat in the dark, dusty room looked up from the parchments scattered atop his desk and directed his attention to the newly arrived visitor. In a low, soothing tone he asked, "What knowledge do you come seeking, child?"</p>

<p align=left>Alerian stepped forwarded and meekly responded, "I seek assistance with a dilemma I do face. I am unsure whether to pursue an apprenticeship with the Archmage of Life, or enter service with the Weaponmaster to learn how to better avoid the physical perils of battle".</p>

<p align=left>The sage rubbed his brow while pondering the situation. "There is a third possibility, child. Might you choose to sacrifice some of the skills you have developed to achieve both of your options?"</p>

<p align=left>Alerian knew well that an idea that sounded too good to be true usually came with dire consequences. "What must I do to achieve both goals, as you say?" he asked.</p>

<p align=left>The sage stood and leaned toward Alerian. "You must unlearn all you know and start with a clean mind. You techniques, manners of manipulating the arcane -- All must change and start afresh. Your experiences in combat are weak and improper -- Time and effort must be spent in training at the expense of your magical power. Only through strict accordance to my words can you acheive that that you seek."</p>

<p align=left>Alerian resigned himself to the cold reality that this was what must be done. So many visits to the lifestone was a reminder that his skills were misaligned the combative tactics that flowed in his mind. "What must I do to start this process?" he asked in a dejected voice.</p>

<p align=left>The old man waved his hand toward a shimmering, violet light. "You must first step through this portal to clense your mind, your soul. At previous experiences will be washed away, and upon exiting to the other side you will rebirthed.</p>

<p align=left>With a heavy sigh, Alerian stepped forward into the light.</p>
