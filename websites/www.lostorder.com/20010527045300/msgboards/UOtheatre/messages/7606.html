: i'll just hit the highlights for now -- leave questions here and i will try to check back monday or tues to answer what i can     

: the uo faire was awesome !!!!

: 1) all shards get new hardware, the company which is now merged with EA  now has the money to upgrade and do more then it has ever done before -- and they plan to be around for a looooong time  
: 2) uo third dawn !!! is awesome -- it is OUR UO  redone in 3-d but from overview persepctive like we have.... with new land, new art, and so much more !!!!
: (note:  uo2, is NOT a replacement or sequel - its really not a uo two   its called origin a separate game)  -- our paperdolls will rotate so we can see all sides, there is finally NEW underware  hehehe    when casting even the paperdoll is animated   there is new awesome graphics for the spells  and soooo much more     
: 3) new music - and a diff music for each instrument
: 4) 3 new riding animals - i cant remember their names -- the info was not suppose to be out but sorta slipped, and then got confirmed   one i know is a unicorn, only females can ride, and one is for just male chars to ride, all three will be super hard to tame, like 99 skill i think
: 5) the osi team is committed to making this game exciting, dynamtic and listening to its players    the new client will allow new art and new enhancements without needing to ship cds
: 6) 20 pr 30 new clothing items, new shoes, new weapons, lots of new stuff in third dawn

: their priority right now is to get third dawn ready to go... alpha testing should be dec, beta in jan       they also have team working on fixing current bugs and making the game the best it can be  

: specifically regarding barding -- even though calayndrll said it would be included in taming sessin, it did not get written in the program  however, during the session i attended i brought it up, 15 mins of the hour session we discussed a bit of barding - though the osi folks in the room were not prepared since they did not know about barding being added till 10 mins before they walked in the room    I will be sending Cal a nice email about this

: They did however has a piece of good advice  -- they do want out ideas, they do want input - but they do not have time to visit all the message boards, and suggested the we discuss our ideas here, get them organized then bring them to the UO boards and add the topic and discuss them there    that the osi team really does read those boards and  really does want to do what they can to make the gaming experience the best for everyone     however, there are issues and many things to consider as we all know so of course not all ideas could be implemented

: well thats about all this foggy brain can remember right now   i have my notes packed somewhere  but right now i need sleep !

: all i can say is it was a totally wonderful faire, and it was a blast meeting folks from UO  and meeting the osi team
