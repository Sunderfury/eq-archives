<p align=left><b>Tea Time</b><br><i>by Mary</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The lovely, young girl hummed softly to herself, as she placed the delicate china tea set on the table in front of her. It was a beautiful day for entertaining, the sun was shining bright, the birds were singing and everything in the glade was peaceful and serene. She smiled happily as she reached into the picnic basket for a plate of freshly baked cookies. Her smile brightened the girl's face, the same way the dawn sun gently wakes the spring flowers. There is no disputing the fact that Mary is a lovely, young woman, long black hair worn high on her head in a top knot, tanned skin still unblemished by age, a petite frame with lithe limbs, all enhanced by her delicately, finely boned features. Only one thing mars the maiden's otherwise angelic beauty- her eyes. </p>

<p align=left>It has been said that the eyes are the windows to the soul. This is most certainly true in Mary's case, for like Mary's soul her eyes are horribly misaligned. Though, the child's deformity never failed to elicit sad head shaking from passerbys, the condition never darkened the girl's attitude towards others. Mary greeted everyone with a warm smile, a girlish giggle, and never seemed to notice when they inevitably looked away from her cross-eyed gaze. Likewise all the mean spirited insults flung at her by the other children never make it past her impregnable fortress of good humor. Mary's face beamed with youthful exuberance as she handed her favorite guest another muffin. </p>

<p align=left>"What a lovely hat Mrs. White. Is it new?" Mary smiled warmly at the unspoken reply. </p>

<p align=left>Still smiling Mary filled the cup of a distinguished gentleman sitting across from her, with strong smelling herbal tea. The young lady watched the gentleman bashfully from beneath her veiled lashes. It was apparent the man was also admiring Mary though much more openly than she was. </p>

<p align=left>"Thank you for coming, Sir Edmund. I am so honored that you could join my little tea party. It takes a very special man to appreciate such frivolities," Mary blushed at the boldness of her statement. </p>

<p align=left>Mary quickly busied herself with the serving the rest of her guests, always the perfect hostess. Tea party was by far Mary's favorite game. She truly loved spending time with her playmates. In her mind a child could not have a nicer, nobler group of friends. </p>

<p align=left>Suddenly, without warning the meadow grew dark as if a cloud had passed in front of the sun. The table and all of its occupants were surrounded in an inky haze. The air grew thick and ominous, the birds stopped singing and all was quite in anticipation. Mary gasped in surprise, then brought her hands together quickly in a childish clap of delight. </p>

<p align=left>"Oh goody, you made it! Hello… Mr. Shadow." A silent pulsating of the darkness was the shadow's only response to Mary's enthusiastic greeting. </p>

<p align=left>A tortured groan broke the silence as a member of the party stirred to life. The woman moved slowly like someone waking from a deep, hypnotic sleep. She raised her head groggily and looked around the table with glassy, red, tear-rimmed eyes. Eager to serve, Mary quickly rose to fill the lady's teacup… but at the sight of Mary with the teapot the woman's eyes grew wide with fear. Mary of course, understood the woman's reaction completely.</p>

<p align=left>"I am soooo sorry, Lady Madeliene. I did not notice your cup was empty. You must think my manners simply deplorable," Mary frowned at her own thoughtlessness. </p>

<p align=left>At the sound of Mary's voice something inside the lady's mind seemed to snap and she began to scream…</p>

<p align=left>"No more…please, no more. Just let me go," the woman sobbed. </p>

<p align=left>Mary smiled sweetly. "No more tea? Alright, how about another cookie?" She asked as she placed another cookie on the woman's plate.</p>

<p align=left>Unable to control her terror, the woman fought against the straps that held her bound securely to her chair. Not wishing to be found negligent again, Mary continued to attend to her other guests. She passed out cookies, poured more tea, straightened the silverware and napkins with care, all the while singing her favorite song absent-mindedly under her breathe…</p>

<p align=left>'I don't want to see you diiieee…No, I reallllly don't want to be there…But if that is the way God has planned you…I'll put pennies on your eyes…Annnnd it will gooooo away. I must be dreaming please stop screaming…You've only lived one minute of your life…I must be dreaming please stop screaming…'</p>

<p align=left>Lady Madelyn cried, fighting frantically at the ropes. She could tell the poison in her system had lost much of its potency over her and her mind was finally beginning to clear. She renewed her efforts to break her restraints. She must get away from this maniac before it was too late. She watched in abject horror as Mary took fresh sprigs of Nightshade and dropped them into the porcelain teapot, with a dash of mint for "flavor." Trying her best to remain calm, Madelyn tried again to reason with the girl making tea.</p>

<p align=left>"They are…all…*sob*… they're all dead, Mary. Please…please…let me go. I don't want to die…please…" The lady's pleas fell upon deaf ears. The girl was obviously too far in her own little world to hear them. Madelyn slumped in her chair, too weak now to fight anymore.</p>

<p align=left>Mary stopped singing and replaced the teapot on its handmade mat to look at the terrified noblewoman sitting next to her. </p>

<p align=left>"Ah, milady, you have let your tea get cold. Here let me get you some fresh and hot from the pot I just made."</p>

<p align=left>Madelyn tried to push herself away from the table and the tea of poison but Mary was already at her side raising the teacup to her shaking lips. </p>

<p align=left>"Here let me help you," said Mary smiling sweetly. </p>

<p align=left>The Lady Madelyn watched in disbelief as long fangs slowly extended from the young girl's mouth. Madelyn opened her mouth to scream and as she did Mary poured a healthy portion of the steaming, hot tea down the woman's throat. The lady coughed and sputtered but it was no use she had swallowed the poison concoction and she could already feel it taking effect on her. "Please…"</p>

<p align=left>Mary considerately dabbed the remaining droplets of tea from the woman's bluing lips. Madelyn struggled a few moments longer and then was still. </p>

<p align=left>Mary chatted happily with her guests, laughing, and smiling all the while. She was having a truly marvelous time. This was the best tea party she had ever hosted. Then abruptly she stopped she stopped smiling and became very serious. Her eyes grew dull and her gaze became fixed, a troubled look crossed her lovely face. In a cold, hard voice that was very much not her own, Mary spoke aloud…</p>

<p align=left>"The savages are upon me…<br>
and I feel my flesh…<br>
Burn…<br>
beneath the teeth…<br>
of their indifference." </p>

<p align=left>The dark mood passed as quickly as it had came and Mary was laughing and smiling again as if nothing at all out of the ordinary had just happened. In fact, as far as Mary was concerned nothing had. She knew that she had minor unexplained black outs from time to time but she had long ago learned to live with them. The only reason she was aware of them at all was when she would wake up in an unfamiliar place but with a strange feeling she had been there before. Mary pondered this bizarre phenomenon a moment but then…</p>

<p align=left>"M-A-R-Y…MARY," came a voice from deep within her mind that only Mary could hear. </p>

<p align=left>"Yes, Momma," the girl replied.</p>

<p align=left>"Mary dear, it is time to come home now." The voice said. </p>

<p align=left>The young girl pouted visibly and begged, "Oh mother, please can't I play just a little while longer…maybe an hour…please!?" </p>

<p align=left>The voice hesitated for a second then said, "Now Mary, you have been playing all day it is time to return. You can play with your friends more tomorrow."</p>

<p align=left>"Alright momma," she said. Mary was not happy about leaving but Mother knows best, so she waved goodbye to all her friends, turned and walked into the woods.</p>

<p align=left>*************************************************************************************</p>

<p align=left>The sun broke over the crest of the horizon announcing a new day. The villagers were just beginning to stir as the light spread across the Akalabethian clearing unveiling a ghastly sight to all. In the middle of the clearing between the beautiful fountain and the sacred grove was placed a finely set table. The table was splendidly adorned with a porcelain tea set and exquisitely made handcrafted silver. It was truly a magnificent display. If not for the occupants of the table the scene would have been most lovely to behold. However, seated around the table in a most macabre fashion were six people, all dressed in formal finery, all of obvious noble status, and all-quite dead. Some still held teacups with a harsh smelling, greenish liquid congealing in their hands, many had small puncture wounds on their necks, and all of them were unnaturally pale, even for the recently deceased. </p>

<p align=left>The members of the Lost Order began to emerge from their homes. As they gathered together to witness this sickening spectacle set before them; many could not help but weep at the hideousness of it. How could this happen they asked. Who would do such a thing? A shadow had indeed fallen over the village and it brought with it death and sadness for all.</p>
