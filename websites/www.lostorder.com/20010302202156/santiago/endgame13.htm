<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">From
the safety of a nearby hilltop, Blogbog watched the battle below. A smile of satisfaction
crossed his lips as he watched his goblin brethren perish at the hands of the dwarves,
elves and humans.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Fools!&quot;
the goblin chieftain hissed. &quot;They did not listen to me! They thought I was crazy!
Well, they have paid the price for their lack of faith!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Blogbog heard a
cracking noise behind him, and jumped to his feet. &quot;At last, at last!&quot; he cried.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Over the past few
days, aided by the dark magicks of the goblin shamans, the egg had grown to the size of a
large boulder. Dozens of tiny cracks now appeared, as the newborn dragon struggled to
break of its shell. Blogbog eagerly rubbed his hands together and jumped up and down.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Yes!&quot;
cried the goblin. &quot;Emerge, and be born!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Finally, the
dragon&#146;s head emerged, and its black forked tongue flickered into the air. The
dragon&#146;s yellow eyes peered at the goblin.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Greetings,
brood of Veeshan! I am Blogbog, king of all goblins. You will be my servant, my agent of
destruction. Together, we will rule this world!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">With a sudden
movement, the egg shattered. The dragon stretched its wings out into the air.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;My, but you are
a large dragon! Well, let&#146;s not waste time. I want you to begin by slaying all the
dwarves, elves and humans in that valley down there. Do you understand?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Apparently the dragon
did not understand, for it lunged forward and bit the goblin&#146;s head off.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font size="4" color="#0080C0">&quot;Tell
me that wasn&#146;t a dragon&#146;s roar,&quot; said Rothan.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That
wasn&#146;t a dragon&#146;s roar,&quot; said Bierfreund.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Liar,&quot;
said Kileyan. &quot;I can see it from here.&quot; The druid pointed to a nearby
mountaintop.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That ain&#146;t
no dragon,&quot; said Dargo. &quot;That&#146;s just a bat.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I am an
elf,&quot; said Kileyan haughtily. &quot;My eyesight is as sharp as an eagle&#146;s, and I
see as well during the darkest night as I do on a sunny afternoon. You, however, are a
dwarf. Your sight is clouded by one too many ales, and by overly bushy eyebrows.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Look, elf, if
ye wanna fight, just say so!&quot; growled the dwarf.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I simply state
the truth,&quot; said the elf.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;And I&#146;m
simply gonna break yer legs if ye don&#146;t shut up!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Kileyan was about to
respond with an angry retort, but he was interrupted by Penaden. All eyes turned toward
the elven bard who sat cross-legged on the grass, strumming the strings of his lute.<br>
</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">As the end draws near<br>
The dwarves fight the elves<br>
Instead of saving the world<br>
We fight amongst ourselves<br>
</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Bloody elf
makes sense for once,&quot; muttered Kherghon.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye, he does at
that,&quot; said Kileyan. The druid extended his hand to Dargo. &quot;Let&#146;s put our
differences aside, Dargo. Tonight we face a common enemy.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Dargo grunted
reluctantly and shook the elf&#146;s hand. &quot;Fine fer now,&quot; he muttered,
&quot;but after tonight&#146;s over I&#146;m gonna kick yer elven arse all the way back to
Felwithe.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;To arms!&quot;
cried Jarlaxle. &quot;The dragon approaches!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Weapons were drawn
and spells were readied. They watched as the creature glided gracefully toward them, like
an angel of death.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I take it
back,&quot; said Dargo. &quot;That ain&#146;t no bloody bat.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Rothan hurled the
first spell, and a brilliant burst of fire erupted from the dragon&#146;s side. It did not
seem to hurt the dragon, but they had definitely gained its attention. As the dragon
swooped in to attack, the heroes threw everything they had at the beast. Axes, spears,
arrows and spells all flew through the air &#150; some of the missiles bounced harmlessly
away, but others found their mark, and the creature was soon bleeding from a dozen
different wounds. The dragon flew up into the air, beyond reach of their blades.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"><img src="http://gamecore.net/everquest/screenshots/santi_end13_dragon.jpg" width="559" height="478" alt="santi_end13_dragon.jpg (59337 bytes)"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Rothan threw another
spell of blue fire at the monster as it retreated, and this time it seemed more effective
&#150; perhaps too effective, for the enraged dragon whirled about and flew directly
toward the mage. Rothan grew pale as he realized he would not survive the attack. But just
as the dragon flew past, Eshay leaped up and drove her sword into the creature&#146;s
flank. The creature reared back and shrieked in pain. Before the others could attack, the
dragon had soared up into the air again. Its flight was unsteady &#150; it had been
heavily wounded.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;He&#146;s
trying to get away!&quot; shouted Walterus.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We must not let
him escape!&quot; shouted Rothan. &quot;He is growing in size by the minute!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well cast a
spell at him or something!&quot; cried Jarlaxle.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I
can&#146;t&#133;my magic has been exhausted!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk watched as
the dragon flew away. Time seemed to stop, and he realized that this was his chance, his
single chance to save the world.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Ancestral
spirits, guide my hands.&quot; He began to cast a spell, a powerful spell that would lift
him into the air and allow him to pursue the dragon and finish it off. But his mind was
still foggy from the dwarven ale &#150; would he be able to successfully complete the
spell?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Taking a deep breath
and pushing his fear aside, he began to trace mystical patterns in the air with his
fingers. Blue sparks of light began to appear around his body, floating and swirling like
a cloud of insects. But wait&#133;something was wrong! With a gasp of disbelief, he
realized that he was casting the wrong spell!</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">But it was too late.
The blue lights coalesced into a solid sphere of magical energy that slowly faded away.
When the magical haze had dissipated, he found himself back in Halas.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Greyhawk!&quot;
shouted Bolgar with surprise. &quot;You&#146;ve returned! I trust your quest was
successful? It must have been, otherwise you would not be here. Is everything all right?
You look tired. You must have had quite a journey! Come on, let&#146;s go have a drink,
and you can tell me all about it.&quot;</font></font></p>
