<p align=left><b>Into The Night, Part Three</b><br><i>by Navrip</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The temple was on high alert for the next several days. With Caine’s escape from the temple’s prison, everyone was on their toes. But, as the festival of Cranth drew closer, people’s nerves began to cool and tensions were relieved. Metry strolled through the dirt streets, glancing briefly at the vendors peddling their wares.</p>

<p align=left>“It’s such a lovely day,” Lindsy said to him. </p>

<p align=left>Metry looked over at her, noticing yet again how beautiful she was. Her flowing black hair framed her pale face nicely. It gave her an ethereal quality that was utterly enthralling. She was slim, yet muscular, having the look of a swimmer. But the most beautiful thing about her was her deep, violet eyes. He could stare into them for all eternity, it felt. He couldn’t help but be head over heels in love with her.</p>

<p align=left>“Aye,” he replied. “It is a lovely day. Perfect for the fair.” He pulled her close to himself, enjoying the feel of her warm flesh against him. </p>

<p align=left>They walked a bit further, enjoying each other’s company. They came upon a gypsy’s tent and Lindsy begged to go inside. Metry was skeptical of the wandering mystic’s abilities to tell fortunes, but he nodded his ascent. She yelped in glee and pulled him along inside the tent.</p>

<p align=left>A bearded man with a colored skull cap greeted them. “Welcome to the mystical tent of the Grigori family. How may we help you?” he asked them.</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy took a seat in front of him. “We come seeking knowledge, kind sir,” she said. His mouth parted in a grin.</p>

<p align=left>“And what would a priestess of Paraly want with a common soothsayer such as myself? Surely, your high priestess can give you more knowledge than I,” the man said. Lindsy seemed impressed by it, though Metry was still skeptical. He could have easily seen her at the dedication earlier, dressed in her clerical robes.</p>

<p align=left>“Oh, there is much you could tell me,” Lindsy said. “My seniors don’t deal with matters of the future.” </p>

<p align=left>“Ah,” the man said, suddenly getting a serious look. “The future, eh? Well, I think I may have the edge in that. But there is a price for all knowledge, and foresight of the future is the most expensive. I would require some compensation for using my gift, therefore.”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy nodded vigorously. She reached into a pocket and produced a large, perfect diamond. Both the gypsy and Metry’s eyes grew wide as she placed it on the table. It was obviously a valuable stone, worth much more than a mere fortune telling. </p>

<p align=left>“Th… Thank you lady!” the man said, in obvious surprise. “You may ask as many questions as you wish for that price!”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy smiled and pulled Metry into the seat beside her. “First question,” Lindsy said, “what will today find for Metry and I?”</p>

<p align=left>The gypsy closed his eyes and placed his hands upon a crystal ball in front of him. He made a show of concentrating and invoked his powers with a few chants. “I see that the two of you will learn much of each other,” he whispered. “One will be impressed with the other.” </p>

<p align=left>Metry rolled his eyes. That was such a vague and general answer that Metry could have foretold it himself. Lindsy seemed as if he just revealed some great secret of life to her. “Second question,” she asked in hushed tones, “what will tommorow find for us?”</p>

<p align=left>The man’s brow furrowed in concentration. Most likely, he was thinking of some generalized answer to give, so he would not seem the charlatan that he was. “I see… I see the two of you separated. A dangerous man stalks one of you while the other speaks with those who passed…” </p>

<p align=left>Metry’s eyebrows raised at this. It was much more specific. “Indeed,” Metry said, “and who would this dangerous man be?” </p>

<p align=left>“I,” the man said. “I cannot tell you… When I ask those beyond, all I see are ships and death.”</p>

<p align=left>Metry gasped slightly. Caine, the man who had escaped the other night, used to be a captain before he was found attempting to steal the Golden Chalice of Unter Brae. When he was found, the bodies of dead guards were all around him. He tried to say it wasn’t him, but the evidence was outstanding against him. This worried Metry highly.</p>

<p align=left>“Third question,” Lindsy said. “Where do you see us in months to come?” </p>

<p align=left>The gypsy concentrated again. Several long seconds passed before he said anything. “I see…” Suddenly, he gasped and his eyes shot open. A candle that was flickering in the corner suddenly died. The man shook his head in confusion and concentrated again. “I see a field. In the middle is a shadow that obscures all that is around it. A young lady stands on the outside of it, a sword in one hand and a staff in the other. A man hangs in the air above, grinning down at her. A rabbit is behind her. No, it’s not a rabbit… It’s a skeleton, creeping up behind her. She doesn’t see it until it’s too late. It grabs her and…” </p>

<p align=left>The man’s eyes shot open. He pulled his shaking hands from the crystal ball and put them up to his eyes. “I can’t continue,” he said in whisper. “I can’t… Take your diamond back… I can’t continue.”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy leaned forward and placed a hand on his arm. “What, good sir, did you see?”</p>

<p align=left>The man looked up and stared directly into her eyes. “The girl…” he said in a cold tone. “It was you lady.”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy suddenly went pale. She raised a hand to her heart. Metry jumped from his chair. “How dare you frighten her like this, you old charlatan!” he yelled. “Why do you make up such hideous stories?” </p>

<p align=left>“Metry,” Lindsy whispered, trying to calm him.</p>

<p align=left>“No,” the man said. “He is right… I had no right to say such dread things. I’m sorry.” He stood and turned. He leaned up against a cabinet. “Please, do not ask me any more. I cannot bear it.”</p>

<p align=left>Metry looked indignant. “You tell us to leave after what you did?”</p>

<p align=left>Lindsy stood and grabbed Metry’s arm. “Let’s go,” she muttered, pulling him from the tent.</p>
