<p align=left><b>Yarp the Never</b><br><i>by Yarp The Never</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Alone in his home, Yarp set the vial down on his table. Tearing off his helm and casting it into a corner, he brushed his mohawked hair back from his eyes. Drawing his hand back, he stared at it, drenched in sweat. This was what he had waited a thousand thousand years for. It was now, or it really and truly was Never….</p>

<p align=left>Yarp closed his eyes and drank deeply.</p>

<p align=left>Nothing.</p>

<p align=left>Opening one eye gingerly, then the other, Yarp let out a scream that shattered the glass in his armoire. “GEIST!!!!” He raised his hands in the air and howled with the rage of a millennia of frustration. As Yarp picked up his table and held it high above his head, poised to throw it through his wall, something happened.</p> 

<p align=left>Yarp opened his eyes wide and dropped the table behind him. As he dropped to his knees, his hands flew to his heart, clutching and grasping at his tunic. Soundlessly his mouth opened and closed and a look of true terror crashed over him like a tsunami. Unable to breathe, he clawed at his chest, as if some invisible force was constricting him. Unwittingly and for the first time ever, he tore his vial from the chain that had been magically secured around his neck. For the first time in a thousand thousand years, he was free from it…</p>

<p align=left>Yarp began convulsing as pain unlike anything he had ever felt before wracked his body. Unable to cry out, Yarp closed his eyes. Even with his lids closed, blinding colour danced in front of him. When he opened his eyes, Geist stood before him.</p>

<p align=left>“I believe you called?” Geist asked with a chuckle.</p>

<p align=left>Yarp looked up at him in utter disbelief, his mouth opening and closing like a fish. He reached a hand out feebly to grasp at the ghost, but passed right through Geist’s leg.</p>

<p align=left>“Perhaps you did not hear me when I said earlier that there would be a cost to your death. Oh yes, it is time to pay the piper, LightBringer. Payment is due in full.</p>

<p align=left>“Let me describe what is happening to you. You are being dissolved from the inside out. Slowly. Very, very slowly. Well, that’s not exactly what’s happening, but the analogy is close enough. A normal person might die an extremely painful death in oh, say a few weeks. They’d most likely die of thirst before the process was through, to tell the truth.” Geist began pacing back and forth as he told his story, seeming more like a teacher, explaining the cosmos to a dimwitted student. “But you, Yarp the Ever,” he spat suddenly, “you aren’t like normal folk, are you. Not at all, eh?”</p>

<p align=left>Geist materialized his foot and sank it into Yarp’s side as he lay writhing in front of him. Yarp didn’t even feel it.</p>

<p align=left>“You are the Ever. The Ever and Ever. And Ever and Ever. You don’t need to eat or drink, now do you? I know that you do, out of convenience and habit, but you can’t starve to death. As you mentioned to me once before, it’s just really uncomfortable.” Geist mockingly mimicked Yarp’s voice, badly, then laughed.</p>

<p align=left>“Oh, and then there is this LUDICROUS idea of your “vampiric symptoms”. Vyktr swears up and down that you are NOT a vampire. So WHAT IN OBLIVION’S NAME ARE YOU!!! Geist had completely lost it at this point, and was raving.</p>

<p align=left>“What will happen to you, Yarp the Ever? Truth be told, I have no idea. You could be in this state for months. It could be years. It could very well be longer than that. Oblivion has a great sense of humour, if you really stop to think about it, you know. Oh, the irony.” Geist sighed happily.</p>

<p align=left>“Well, then, I am off. Have a nice weekend!” Geist chirped as he made motions to leave. Yarp summoned all his strength, and with a burst of energy that he shouldn’t have had, he lunged at Geist. Even this mammoth effort resulted in only a feeble gesture.</p>

<p align=left>“Oh, what’s this? Is there something else I can do for you, sir? Can I help you with something? Perhaps a nice tunic of Misery to match your new cloak of Poetic Justice?” Geist suddenly knelt down and violently took Yarp’s head in his hand. “Yarp, we can end this. We can end this now. The others are waiting, Yarp. Will you turn? Will you end this? Let us help you….help me … help you, Yarp.”</p>

<p align=left>Yarp nodded, slowly. Though it should not have been possible, a look of even greater pain crossed his face as he sold what was left of his soul.</p>

<p align=left>With an almost girlish squeal of delight, Geist scooped up the quivering Yarp and walked through a newly materialized gate. He stepped through the other side into the Crypts of Yew. In the flickering shadows cast by the candles that illuminated the room, Yarp could see Killer. Gloomshade was floating in the corner, and he could make out the profile of Mesostopheles. Standing in the center of the bloodied pentagram inscribed on the floor was Leshrac, with Bal-Anon Dak, the High Priest of the Order of the Ebon Skull. With a motion, Bal-Anon doused the candles, plunging the crypts into darkness. A heavy thud echoed throughout the dank crypts, followed by an equally heavy silence.</p> 

<p align=left>Some time later, Bal-Anon re-ignited the candles, illuminating the room. Yarp’s body lay strewn in pieces about the pentagram. Geist spoke, his voice trembling with excitement. “Show yourself, Yarp. Arise, from the land of the EverLife into the new domain of NeverLife. Take your place.”</p>

<p align=left>With a whisper and a moan, a shimmering figure appeared, clothed in a grey robe. A hood shrouded it’s face. One hand reached to unsheath a katana and the other reached to remove the cloak. As the cloak fell, the candles lighted up Yarp’s face. He looked down at his hands, at his body, at the candlelight shining through them both.</p>

<p align=left>Leshrac spoke. “You are reborn a wraith. Look upon the flesh-bound ones with pity and contempt. You have been relieved of your burden of meat. You have been given a gift, old one. Welcome.”</p>

<p align=left>With a heavy sound in his voice, Yarp spoke. It came out in a deep rumble, the sound of the ancient mountains…</p>

<p align=left>With inhuman quickness, Yarp suddenly turned to face the Order of the Ebon Skull and spoke sullenly. “I will not thank you. And no, I will not join you, even if you would have me. You betrayed me – no, do not speak. You have done enough…” Yarp lifted his hand as Geist moved to speak. “I am dead. It is what I wanted. A part of me now feels at peace….which is more than I had before.</p>

<p align=left>As Yarp dematerialized and disappeared the crypts echoed with his voice…

<p align=left>“Dead is Yarp the Ever. Awakened is Yarp the Never….”

<p align=left>On the floor of Yarp’s home, amongst his possessions and his furniture which lay strewn about, was a small vial. It was attached to a fine gold chain, which was snapped in two. Encircling the vial were fine runes, etched in a language long since dead. It was filled with a dark red liquid.</p> 

<p align=left>As Yarp materialized in his home, he picked up the vial and held it in his hand. With an effortless motion, he crushed it between his fingers, the blood running down his hand and seeping into the ground.</p>

<p align=left>“Dead is Yarp the Ever. Beware Yarp the Never….”</p>
