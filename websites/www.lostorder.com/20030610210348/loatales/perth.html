<p align=left><b>A Time of Rest</b><br><i>by Perth</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Perth sat quietly on the fallen log, overlooking the ancient stone ring of the Unkempt Druids. The past summer, he had spent most of his time traveling the lands alone, enjoying the solitary pleasure of himself and the world. Many wondrous sights he had seen and many splendid people he had met. Sipping the honey mead slowly from his crude stein, a sharp cracking noise brought him out of his thoughts.</p>

<p align=left>"Greetings druid."</p>

<p align=left>Looking back over his shoulder, he saw a rough looking sort of man. The human's clothes were torn and many stained patches covered his tunic. His skin was incredibly tan, almost as deep as rawhide, while a short grey beard grew from his scarred face. His eyes, as grey as steel, hid great wisdom as the unkempt druid looked down upon Perth. Using his great staff as support, the old man gingerly lowered himself to rest on the log next to the elf.</p>

<p align=left>"I have noticed ye watching us from afar. Ye smell of the woodlands, Druid, but the stink of city life is upon you. Why have ye come to watch us?"</p>

<p align=left>"My name is Perth. I watch ye because I admire thee and yer kin. What a life it must be serving only the will of the world! During the past months, I have traveled alone - seeking peace on the winds of Norrath and to Rathe I find myself drawn time and time again. There is something here that I do not understand - something very raw and unrefined - something that beckons me to know more."</p>

<p align=left>The old druid looked deep into Perth then spoke, "Friend, that is why we have come here. To find peace in this place, to be one with just ourselves and the natural world. We find comfort away from the bustling cities, comfort away from the murderous rampaging of the so-called enlightened races. As you are only now beginning to see, the outside world is filled with greed and those hungry for power – it leaves such a great distaste on the lips. Can you taste it?”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye. That I can. Sir, if’n ye would let me stay to learn more I would be most happy. I have naught but the power of Tunare to offer but the comfort I find here is worth so much more. The outside world has broken me; the congested cities have bruised my heart. The power mad and greedy have murdered my will – if I can only stay here for a short time, perhaps I shall come to understand.”</p>

<p align=left>The ancient man looked deep into Perth’s eyes and saw virtue. Planting the great staff firmly into the dirt, the druid rose and offered his hand to the wood elf.</p>

<p align=left>“Come, ye must meet the others. I believe one of them ye know, in fact, I believe he be of yer bloodline.”</p>

<p align=left>Rising from his rest, Perth followed the man down to the stone ring. As he approached, he saw many unfamiliar people gathered about the stones. Scanning the crowd, Perth met eyes with a particularly dirty druid.</p>

<p align=left>“Everett? Is that you?”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye Uncle, it is. Come, rest yourself by our fire – and drink a toast to those that have come before and will always come after. It is time to relax and release the burdens of the outside world.”</p>
