good day to ye!</font></font><font color="#000000"></font>
<p><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light"><font color="#000000">Welcome
to the very first issue of the akalabethian, a journal for all members
of the <a href="http://www.lostorder.com">lost order</a> to enjoy, detailing
our lives within this glorious land of norrath. Before ye set forth I hath
a couple of requests for ye. Firstly if ye feel ye hath something yer feel
is fit to print then please send it via courier to the druid <a href="mailto:ralineth@lostorder.com">Ralineth
Oakenheart
</a>- but a word of warning ... don't use the orc runners as
they are notoriously unreliable, especially through the Butcherblock Mountains.
Secondly, anything written here does not express the opinions of the editor,
nor that of the Lost Order of Akalabeth.</font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light"><font color="#000000">Anyway
read on...</font></font></td>

Druids in Kelethin</font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light"><font color="#000000">Reports
from the Heartwood Master, the druidic master in Kelethin, indicate there
has been a sharp increase in the number of young woodelves graduating from
his basic forestry courses. At a loss to explain the sudden influx of students
the elderly druid could only shrug and mutter something about jumping onto
a bandwagon - perhaps he means that they are all dropouts from the bardic
college.</font></font><font color="#000000"></font>

in a state of unrest</font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light"><font color="#000000">The unlucky
Estate of Unrest has recently been the focus of attention for a large number
of Akalabethians. In an effort to discover the lure of this place our resident
wolf joined up with a bizarre combination of stumpy legs, long noses,&nbsp;
and a tree hugger. It appears the Estate is over run with the living dead,
and is also in dire need of a good spring clean. After bashing a large
number of these of creatures into dust, Woozle the long nose decided to
bring a large group of ghouls to see us. Needless to say a certain wolf
then spent some time recovering items from his corpse.</font></font></td>

spotted in the Ocean of Tears</font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light"><font color="#000000">Over recent
weeks there have been numerous reports by travelers across the ocean of
tears of a large ogre wearing excessive amounts of bronze platemail wandering
between the islands. What he is doing so far from the swamps remains unknown,
and it has been reported that he is occasionally in the company of a renegade
woodelf ranger. If any further information on these two miscreants becomes
available we will let you all know.</font></font></td>

in Halas a success!</font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light"><font color="#000000">We recently
caught up with Gradishar T'Alon, Lord of Assembly of the Norrathian LOA
and discussed the Halas Conclave. Gradishar was pleased with the turnout,
despite a no show from a number of inkies and other undesirables within
the city itself. Pressed for further details Grad was rather unclear on
what actually happened, explaining that the 15 bottles of dwarvern ale
he consumed before the drunken goblin chase knocked him around a bit.</font></font></td>

Afoot?</font></font>
<br><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light"><font color="#000000">We have
no firm details yet, but by all reports there is something big brewing
that will affect all us. My sources are unsure yet if this is another plot
by that the Draconian Deity Veeshan to regain control of Norrath, or a
threat from somewhere completely different. Rest assured readers that we
let you know when we get more information on this.</font></font><font color="#000000"></font>
