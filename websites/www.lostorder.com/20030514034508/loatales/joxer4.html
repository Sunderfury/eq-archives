<p align=left><b>The Origin of Joxer</b><br><i>by Joxer</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Lord Joxer the Mighty, Grandmaster Swordsman & Captain of the Charon's Pride</p>

<p align=left>The Brewman was busy tonight. The clatter of tankards and aging wood rang
throughout the festive pub. Yule celebrations were in full effect with holly
wreathes and garland draperies strung about the soot covered rafters. The
place was quite packed, as it usually was this time of year; a fire, freshly
made, burned brightly - casting misshapen shadows across the main room. The
Tavern was alive with chatter.</p>

<p align=left>Joxer the Mighty sat quite drunk on a bench near the hearth. He gripped a
large mug of mead in his thin left hand as he stared deeply into the crimson
glow.  The Lord nervously played with his thick mustache as he gazed -
obviously deep in thought about some past event.  A small child, about the
age of seven, walked cautiously up to the thoughtful warrior carrying a
small toy ship carved out of the finest Yew.</p>

<p align=left>"My lord," the young child said, "Brother Brimstone said ye would tell me of
the sea.. he said ye knew of far off lands and magical folk."</p>

<p align=left>Joxer, startled out of the drunken pondering, turned his gaze down to the
peasant. As he gazed at the child, a tear welled up in his eye and slowly
dripped down his cheek - a distant pain being caressed with care.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye lad, I do. Come here and let me tell ye my story." The child, a poor
boy named Merrel from the neighboring Abbey, climbed into Joxer's lap,
attentive to every word.</p>

<p align=left>"I was born in a small town known as Illwood, located on the southern shores
or Brittannia near the Great Jungle. Aye, son, many moons ago that Jungle
was taken care of and inhabitants of isolated villages grew wealthy off the
various rare plants and exotic birds that once lived in abundance there.
Fair Trinsic, just a few days ride to the north, was the majestic jewel of
the south. I can still remember the way the jungle mists softly embrace that
great city in the mornings. Aye, what a sight indeed."</p>

<p align=left>"This was, of course, before the wicked slavers came. We were kind and
hospitable to the many trappers that came from Trinsic, but once news of a
possible iron shortage near Destard reached us, many armed men entered the
jungles looking to enslave the once peaceful lizardfolk for use as cheap
labor in the work camps. The lizardfolk, being mighty in their own right,
fought back with an unexpected vengeance."</p>

<p align=left>"Soon after the villages began to burn. I can still remember the day the
lizardmen attacked Illwood. I was baking a Dewberry Pie for my wife and
child, the smell of which still haunts me to this day. It was about midday I
believe, the jungle was hot and humid, very typical this time of year..the
screams.hissing.."</p>

<p align=left>"I awoke much later on a merchant ship headed for Serpent's Hold. The Greel
Major was her name. I had been severely wounded in the attack and left for
dead, a large gash cut deep into my chest - the victim of a savage spear
thrust. Captain Greel, during a routine run of the coastline, spotted the
burning village just after sunset. He and his men rescued several of us that
were left for dead - the lizardmen having long since vanished back into the
deep Jungle. My wife, Laurell, and son Geoffrey were not so lucky...I can
still hear her sometimes in the middle of the night.gently whispering my
name or singing sweet Geoffrey to sleep..."</p>

<p align=left>"I spent many months recovering at Serpent's Hold.the thought of my lost
friends and family weighing heavy on my spirit. Captain Greel and I had
become good friends during this time as he was often traveling to and from
the Hold and Trinsic. He was a burly man, not even six stones tall, but with
the demeanor of a giant. A good friend he was and in my days of confusion,
he gave me purpose aboard his ship. We sailed for many moons together -
Greel teaching me the ways of the Great Oceans so that I may perhaps command
my own ship and assist him in his trades."</p>

<p align=left>"We came across several pirates in our travels, among them included the
Dread Baert the Grim himself! It was that foul pirate's ship, the Charon's
Pride, which we conquered! Oh the sight of her on the horizon was
incredible! Her freshly painted ebony hull appearing as a demon on the dark
waters. But the skill of Captain Greel and his well-trained guards were too
much for the battle weary Baert. 'Twas I, Joxer the Mighty, who bested him
in combat - the ship being my true reward. I sailed that shackled pirate
back to the Serpent's Hold where to this day he rots, lamenting his past
greatness."</p>

<p align=left>"My travels are wide, young friend, wide indeed. I have sailed the whole of
the world, seeing many strange lands and wondrous peoples. I have fought
with the greatest of Lords, sailed with the virtuous of men. I even gave the
one known as the Avatar a ride to Buccaneer's Den once - he was on some
mission of great import that he would not disclose. It was on one of my many
sea going journeys to Deceit that I met a most noble of men, Lord
Unforgiven. He spoke to me of a great guild that had the noblest of
citizenry that served to uphold the sacred virtues. I learned of the Shard
and Tome and pledged my heart to that cause. Aye lad, now ye find me still
here in their gracious company."</p>

<p align=left>"That is my story, or a small part of it.now go, take yer ship to the water
and set it afloat. Only then will it take ye where ye need to be. Free, with
virtue, but free nonetheless."</p>
