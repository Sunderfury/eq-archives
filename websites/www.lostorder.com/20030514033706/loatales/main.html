<p align=left>I have many many stories to update. I apologize for the recent lack of updates but computer problems, hvaing too much fun in EQ, and durm corps rehearsals have made me tend to forget to update the site. I would always remember when I wasn't at home =P  Anyway, look for an update to go in over the next few days. I am thinking of redesigning the site somewhat, but I haven't figured out quite what I want to do. Again, my apologies for the lack of updates but one will bve made soon, have no fear.</p>

<p align=left>Please let me know what you think of these stories. Feel free to submit your stories. I will post those as well. Send me links to other story sites that you like. I'll create a page dedicated to story links if I receive enough of them. Send me screenshots that you think are cool, and I'll put them on the screenshot page with a caption that you choose (provided it is not vulgar). The "email me" link above will ensure that my most trusted couriers get your missive to me promptly, and that you will receive a reply just as quick! Safe travels and good fortune to ye, my friend. Farewell!</p>
