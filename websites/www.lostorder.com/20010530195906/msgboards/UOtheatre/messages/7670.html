<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">Well, lesee … Erin Pinesong and me went to th' Fair. What did we find there? <p>First there was this wee little issue of travel. Walk or recall? As most adventures start this way, we entered a gate. From Minoc … no 'twas Colorado Springs we passed to Moonglow … no 'twas Dallas. Then saying th' magic word "recdu" … no 'twas "my suitcase has not been out of my sight since I entered the airport since I arrived here", through th' Portal we did go to th' frontier town o' Papua … nay, 'twas th' wild west town o' Austin. There was th' Fair.<p>Well, not quite. Bought a horse … nay a car at the local stable an all, and we traveled to th' local inn and logged out. <p>*snore*<p>The next morning it was on to th' Faire. Long lines there.<p><IMG src="http://www.home.earthlink.net/~gesuchan/Dscn0253_Registering_at_the_Fair.jpg"><p>Who are all of these people anyway? In truth I never met anyone at the Faire who I knew from UO. In truth, the only one I thought I might meet was "Amber", and somehow missed her. Not all bad, if course. We could do what we wanted and no one would be the wiser!<p>HAR! Har!<p>No really, no one knows Talesn's Maker. Kind of a permanent Incognito spell. <p>Anyway, the lines were long. See those people lurking in the shadows? The ones wearing the blue robes? Amber knows about them. They were powerless to make the lines move faster. Sound familiar? Drat even Tryant <p><IMG src="http://www.home.earthlink.net/~gesuchan/Dscn0254_Tyrant.jpg"><p>was powerless to make them move faster. I am sure he was not happy about that because he was supposed to kick off the Fair from 9 to 10 with a welcome address. Instead he spoke for only about 15 minutes and after some fumbling around and hardware crashes showed all us eager Fair Goers a demonstration of things to come. <p>Silly me, I thought this was UO2, but that didn't seem right. What? It is a surprise instead. It is UO 3D, also known as UO Third Dawn. If you want to know more about UO Third Dawn, <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/news/CommunityNews.shtml#newsitem975199419,70697,">look here.</a><p><br>For our registration fee we were promised, by no one less than Tyrant himself, that we would receive free, in the mail, the beta CD. A savings of $4.95 according to Tyrant. I can tell you I am looking forward to that.<p>If you want to read more about Tyrant as well as some of his comments on the UO Faire, then check out <a href="http://uohoc.stratics.com/logs/uocc001120.htm">Gordon Walton, aka Tyrant, Vice President of Online Services at Origin.</a> More later.<p>Well, that was loud, fast, and over. So we went to our first session. Crafts: Blacksmithing & Tinkering, by Christian "Prophet" Lasson and Thomas "Hanse" Edison.<p><IMG src="http://www.home.earthlink.net/~gesuchan/Dscn0255_Hanse_or_Prophet.jpg"><p><IMG src="http://www.home.earthlink.net/~gesuchan/Dscn0256_Hanse_or_Prophet.jpg"><p>If anyone (Amber) knows which of these pictures is which, let me know,<p>As this was my first session, I was there to learn. The first thing I notice was that although there were maybe 30 to 40 people attending, the large room was not nearly full. As it turns out this was universally the case. No session was ever full and one could attend any of them that was in session. <p>Well what went on in the Crafts: Blacksmithing & Tinkering session that was in session. The official blurb says: <p>"Crafts such as smithing and tinkering are the backbone of the player economy. What's working and what needs to work to make it better?"<p>So the second thing I learned in this, my first session was this: The OSI employees told us little unless specifically asked. Their purpose in being there was to hear from us, the players. They wanted to hear our thoughts and ideas, gripes and complaints, suggestions and congratulations. Well, that was good, but most Fair goers thought the street was kind of one way.<p>None the less, almost every OSI employee, programmer, designer, and manager type demonstrated a considerable interest, even love for UO. They really do care and really do want the game to be the best they can make. They even want to hear from us. Not that they are going to tell us what they do with our thoughts, but they want to hear them. There were exceptions to this early in the second day of the Fair, but I think the problem was too much Orc Ale or whatnot.<p>As for Prophet and Hanse, these guys are the real thing. They program the crafts, made the new smithing menu, did resmelting and all that. Of course, few are there from the beginning. <p>Lord British is dead!<br>Long Live Lord British! <p>Anyway, these guys didn't hear anything new from us Fair goers. Everything we said has been repeated over and over on various boards. Not that they read the boards. <p>I think that was another thing I found out. For the most part, OSI does not really read the boards. They want us to post on their own OSI boards. They read them. So they say. Certainly, OSI could benefit if they would hire a decent PR person, or a professional in human behavior.  One of those more academic types that can look at the big picture and hopefully integrate that with the profit equation.<p>Anyway, people mentioned Armor, weight of armor, color of armor. I brought up the issue of ingot prices vs. armor prices. People wanted colored weapons (from colored ore), properties of armor related to colored armor. E.g., flame colored armor would work better with fire monsters, shadow armor would work better against the undead, etc. Same for weapons. The idea of enchanted weapons was discussed, and so fourth.<p>My next session was "Bringing back the Virtues to UO" lead by Paul "Sage" Sage. Inventive name, eh?<p><IMG src="http://www.home.earthlink.net/~gesuchan/Dscn0257_Sage.jpg"><p>I have already alluded to this session in my previous post to the CBA at <a href=" http://www.lostorder.com/msgboards/UOtheatre/messages/7618.html"> Aye Santiago, 'tis all well and good …</a> so I won't go into all of the details here. A couple of comments are in order, however. <p>First is the very significant fact that Sage is very serious about this issue. The Virtues are very important in his mind to UO. The problem issue however is, how can anything be included in code? Also, and even more seriously, what should be done? Finally, it is not clear how prevalent Sage's views are within OSI. Clearly, even if he knew what to do, and was able to do it technically, it would still be necessary to convince the rest of the organization to make it a priority.<p>Second, It may be a sad fact that the Virtues are not high on the players (us) list of priorities. I noticed that the thread I started on this has few contributors. It is an issue that tweaks the mind.<p>This is dratted plenty of reporting on the Faire for now. If anyone wants more let me know.
