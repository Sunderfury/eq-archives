<p align=left><b>In Search Of Answers</b><br><i>by Greyhawk</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A soft mist settled on the shoreline as a siren's alluring song was heard in the distance. The shaman stood there in silence, mesmirized by the song, his emotions twisted and torn. Feelings of failure haunted his mind as he desperately searched for a sense of well-being and inner peace. Alas, he found none. How he wished for a more simple life, perhaps a fisherman, or a farmer of the Karanas. He wished that there was someone to guide him, someone to share his thoughts with, someone to turn to when feeling hopeless. He wished that his family hadn't abandoned him in Halas as a child, leaving only a mystery in their wake. At that moment, the shaman opened his eyes and felt a surge of blood in his veins. "How could I be so foolish?" he whispered to the wind.</p>
 
<p align=left>The search for his ancestors had led him here, a place unknown to the masses, and purposely removed from the ancient tomes. It had taken nearly a lifetime to learn of it's existance, and cost him sacrifices he would never forget. He could only wonder why his forefathers travelled to this forgotten land and never returned. What fate became of them, he pondered. How could the Tribunal still condemn his family name, years after they had vanished from Halas? All of the unanswered questions flooded his mind, forcing the shaman to drop to his knees.</p>

<p align=left>Signs of life permeated the air as a cool breeze slipped through the treetops. Up ahead, a winding path too shape in the ground, leading towards a series of pillars and onward through the hills. The shaman paused at the base of the path, and gazed into the blue horizon. He knew that answers would lie beyond this path, answers he sought since he was merely a child. Whether they would bring sorrow or joy was of no consequence. His entire purpose was focused on seeking the truth long hidden from him, to bring closure and fulfillment. Gathering himself, the shaman slowly continued onward down the path, prepared for whatever fate would await him.</p>

<p align=left>Carefully watching his surroundings, the shaman trudged forward through the array of hills. Suddenly, he noticed a structure in the distance which could not be a tree. Feeling rejuvenated, he began to run towards the structure, as if his feet were floating beneath him. Having a clear view now, he stopped running and hid behind a small tree. It was evident that some civilization thrived here. A magnificent tower had been erected, surrounded by large white stone walls. A few carcasses littered the ground, a feast for the insects and vermin. Still, he had yet to encounter any advanced life in the surrounding area. But he knew all too well that someone, or something, lived beyond those walls.</p>

<p align=left>Could this be where his ancestors met their fate, he thought. Would the inhabitants in this strange place be friend or foe? Realizing he was alone, the shaman could not shake the sense of fear building inside him. He had not come here seeking battle, yet had no idea if the inhabitants would see him as a threat or not. "If only I had someone with me," he whispered to himself. Scenes from his memory rushed through his mind. Scenes from glorious adventures, standing side by side with his friends, overcoming insurmountable odds. Cursing himself for abandoning those who cared for him and leaving a promise unfulfilled, the shaman quickly ran back into the tree-laden hills. He had much to learn of this place before taking the next daring step. Perhaps with time he thought, the answers would come into focus naturally.</p>
