<p align=left><b>Dark Conceivings</b><br><i>by Navrip</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>There is one place in the world that few know exist. Perhaps it is because few can survive it’s depths and those that do often come back warped and unwilling to relate their tale. But it exists, a monument to the depths of darkness and evil that infest the land. Hidden deep within a crumbling mountain, it is a tomb to the heroes of darkness, the masters of death, and the mistresses of pain. Many lay here, having fallen in battle against the hateful Consuming Light. </p>

<p align=left>One woman lays there, a tribute to the beauty of the Darkness, falling so that she may better serve her master. Strong and powerful in life, she stood side by side Navrip as the Revered Mother of the Holy Disciples of the Darkness. But now, her time having passed, she lies as she stood, in the absence of light. As perfect as a human could be, as one with the Darkness insider her as any other.</p>

<p align=left>Now a dark figure stepped into the halls, dust rising gently around his feet. His size belying the litheness with which he stepped through the crypt, not making a single sound. His eyes burned with an unholy light, two pinpoints of red light in the darkness of the catacombs. Every so often, a small sound, like that of a clock, would come from him. The spirits of the fallen shied away from him, fearing that he lash out with fury at their gall.</p>

<p align=left>But he made no action other than continue on his unwavering course. Straight towards Tempest’s body. Straight to the one who had challenged his mind, body, and soul over and over. The only one he would ever call an equal. A specter, which gave off a ghastly glow, was slow in fleeing from his path and gave light to the features of the man. Emblems etched upon his breastplate; a haunting skull, a black lily with prickly thorns, and a piercing sword. Around his neck hung a bejeweled amulet, sporting five draconic heads, rounding the colors of chromatic. A royal purple cape fluttered behind him in the wake of his stride.</p>

<p align=left>Finally, he came to her. She lay serene, upon the obsidian slab which was her tomb, preserved for time eternal. His hand reached down, it’s cold, metallic surface stroking the tender flesh of her cheek. Note an emotion passed through him as he touched the dead flesh. </p>

<p align=left>“Ah, Tempest, my equal. How the years have passed without you, time that is inconsequential to me. And here you lie, as I left you, not a hair disturbed.” Navrip looked around the crypt. “Does your spirit too inhabit this place, wailing in agony for release? Or do you sleep deep inside the bosom of the Darkness which you served so greatly in life? And are you looking at me from the afterlife even now, wondering at my actions? Or have you guessed my intent all ready? You always were clever, a wit unparalleled by none. As cold as myself, as devoid of weakness and emotion, which are indeed the same thing. No, I think not. I think you do not see me, nor do you care. You have passed this mortal coil, your clock has unwound.”</p>

<p align=left>Navrip pulled his hand away and reached down to his belt. He unsheathed a dark, crimson blade, forged of a special ore. It held within it the power to drain souls, capture the essence of life. But that was not its purpose here. No, in fact, it was for a much darker purpose. Lifting Tempest’s head from the slab roughly, he brought the blade around. It cut a deep wound into the base of her neck. Dark ichor spilled out. Navrip took a vial from his pouch, placed it under the wound, and collected the fertile remnants of the blood.</p>

<p align=left>He released Tempest’s head and it fell back to the slap, with a dull slap. Navrip stared at the vial of fresh fluid, almost as if he was trying to determine its properties. He held it under his flat nostrils, letting the odor waft into his olfactory sensors, like a connoisseur of wine. Closing his eyes, Navrip stood motionless for a moment. He seemed to be considering the consequences of his actions. But then he realized he did not truly care. Without hesitation, he brought the vial to his lips and drank of it.</p>

<p align=left>Vile spasms rocked his body. No pain came with them, but they jarred Navrip. His arm shot out, causing spider-web cracks in the solid, mountain wall. He lurched forward, his other arm flailing wildly, knocking a corpse from its resting place. Fearing further damage to the hallowed place and its inhabitants, Navrip fell to the ground, allowing his body to shut down. Blackness consumed him, but unlike his periods of regeneration, this was not a welcome blackness.</p>

<p align=left>Seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, centuries, millennia. Navrip knew not how much time had passed since he fell unconscious. But he was aware once again. And he knew his surroundings immediately. He was in the same room, in the same crypts, in the same mountain. But he lay atop a slab of obsidian. He looked around and saw that he was laying where the body he had knocked aside once had lain. Looking to the floor, he saw that the body was still there, outside the protective magic of the obsidian. It had not decayed much, if, indeed, at all.</p>

<p align=left>Navrip sat up. Something had placed him upon the slab. Something with enough strength to lift him and put him onto it. No human could have done it. None of the spirits would have bothered. It meant only one thing…</p>

<p align=left>“Greetings,” a voice came from the darkness. Navrip looked and saw an amalgam of flesh and metal. It was a graceful, beautiful being in the eyes of Navrip, but a horrid abomination to others. Random parts of its body were metal, the other half flesh. The positioning seemed to be haphazard, but Navrip saw the subtle pattern inherent in its creation. </p>

<p align=left>Navrip stood. “Maglore… Maglore Freemech. My son.”</p>
