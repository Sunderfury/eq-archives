</font><font SIZE="2">

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">Deep
beneath the roots of the Steamfont Mountains lies the gnomish city of Ak&#146;Anon. Many
outsiders travel great distances to behold its mechanical wonders. The city is famous for
the various robots and machines that stir and whir and click and tick all day long. But
beware&#133;some say that prolonged exposure to the incessant noises can result in utter
insanity. While this has never been conclusively proven, many point to the often erratic
behavior of gnomes as an example. Though it has never officially been authorized or
authenticated as an official word, the term &#145;wonky&#146; is often used colloquially
as a reference to gnomish madness.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&#145;What does this
have to do with anything?&#146; you might ask. It is common knowledge that, with respect
to mental stability, gnomes are not the strongest of all the known races. But what most
people do not know is that Ak&#146;Anon hides a great and terrible secret.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Those who reveal this
secret are subject to terrible punishment &#150; perhaps you have seen their decaying
skeletons roaming mindlessly across the desolate wilderness.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Hidden deep beneath
the city, deeper than even its deepest dungeons, lies a vast chamber. Within this chamber,
a small band of ancient gnomes toil endlessly. Picked from among the most intellectually
advanced members of their species, these few gnomes are held in the highest esteem by the
other members of their community. For these elite few hold the safety of the entire world
in their tiny hands.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">However, the fact
remains that they are gnomes. And such being the case, it is inevitable that one of them
will occasionally go &#145;wonky&#146;.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"></font><font color="#0080C0"><img src="greenbar.gif" alt="greenbar.gif (1894 bytes)" WIDTH="271" HEIGHT="12"></font><font size="4"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font size="4" color="#0080C0">McQuaid&#146;s
wizened features contorted into a scowl as he gazed up at the giant viewscreen. Displayed
upon the screen&#146;s surface was an image of a world &#150; his world. Normally, the
view was that of a serene planet, spinning happily upon its axis. But now there was one
minor blemish: a gargantuan dragon had wrapped its wings over most of the planet&#146;s
surface, and was threatening to destroy it entirely.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I hate that
bloody creature,&quot; muttered the gnome.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The command center
was in chaos. Everywhere he looked, there were gnomes running around with worried
expressions on their diminutive faces. Light blinked on and off, papers flew through the
air, and there was a general sense of impending doom that made McQuaid want to jump into
the document shredder.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Commander on
deck!&quot; cried one of the gnomes. All of the tiny eyes turned and watched as Commander
Smedley entered the command center. For a moment, the commander simply stood there,
looking as dignified and regal as a three-foot-tall gnome can look. Then he spotted
McQuaid at one of the consoles and marched toward him.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;McQuaid&#133;update!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Um&#133;well,
sir&#133;it appears that things have&#133;um&#133;well, I mean&#133;circumstances
have&#133;erm&#133;&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Out with
it!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We&#146;re
screwed, sir.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Smedley glanced at
the overhead screen. &quot;Ah, I see. The egg finally hatched.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">McQuaid blinked a
couple of times. &quot;Sir? You mean&#133;you knew about this?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">There was a strange,
wild expression in Smedley&#146;s eyes as he smiled at the chief engineer. &quot;Of course
I knew about it. All according to my plan.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;What plan? What
are you talking about?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;This world is
flawed, McQuaid. Imperfect. The best thing to do with an imperfect machine is to destroy
it and start over again from scratch.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You&#146;re
mad! I won&#146;t let you destroy the world!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Smedley shook his
head. &quot;It&#146;s already too late, my friend.&quot; He gazed up at the image of the
dragon on the display. &quot;He is splendid, is he not? The perfect harbinger of
destruction.&quot; Smedley began to laugh &#150; an insane high-pitched giggle that made
McQuaid&#146;s skin crawl.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Smedley was laughing
still even as the guards carried him out of the room.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">One of the engineers
timidly approached McQuaid. &quot;Excuse me, sir&#133;is it true? Are we all doomed?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Not by a long
shot,&quot; said McQuaid. &quot;Prepare to launch the Final Release.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The engineer
staggered. &quot;But sir&#133;! Do you realize what that will do?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It will charge
the planet&#146;s atmosphere into a state of highly reactive volatility. Then we&#146;ll
light a match, and blow that dragon to kingdom come.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;But what about
the people?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We can&#146;t
save them,&quot; said McQuaid. &quot;There&#146;s no time. But we do have their data
patterns in our computer banks. We&#146;ll be able to recreate them once the planet&#146;s
surface is again inhabitable. We&#146;ll even give them food and water&#133;maybe even a
weapon or some spell scrolls. Look, I don&#146;t like this any more than you do. But I
don&#146;t see any other way out of this, do you?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The engineer sighed
and shook his head.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Right,
then,&quot; said McQuaid. &quot;Battle stations.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"></font><font color="#0080C0"><img src="greenbar.gif" alt="greenbar.gif (1894 bytes)" WIDTH="271" HEIGHT="12"></font><font size="4"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font size="4" color="#0080C0">The peak of
highest mountain in the Steamfonts opened up, and a gigantic mechanical eye emerged,
slowly rising up into the air. The awesome Red Eye engine had been built ages ago by the
gnomish military as a &#145;last defense&#146; measure for the planet &#150; a device that
would turn the planet itself into a weapon. Many had argued against its creation, doubting
that it would ever be needed. But the military advocates eventually won the favor of the
council. None of the council members could resist the idea that the gnomes would be in
control of the most powerful weapon in the world. Many scholars believe that the gnomes
attempt to compensate for their tiny size by seeking incredible destructive power.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">As the gnomes donned
their tinted goggles, McQuaid gave the order. The chief engineer pressed a big red button,
and the world blew up.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"></font><font color="#0080C0"><img src="greenbar.gif" alt="greenbar.gif (1894 bytes)" WIDTH="271" HEIGHT="12"></font><font size="4"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font size="4" color="#0080C0">&quot;Damage
report!&quot; shouted McQuaid.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Everything&#146;s
gone to hell, sir,&quot; said a technician.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Um, can you be
a little more specific?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;All of our
systems are down. Stability is less than 5 percent. We&#146;re losing packets left and
right.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Can you
identify the source?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The gnome fiddled
with the buttons on his console. &quot;Ah, hell. It&#146;s UUNet, sir.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Dammit! Where
is he?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The two gnomes ran
across the chamber and climbed down a ladder leading to an area known as &quot;The
Pit&quot;, where they kept all of the robots. In one of the dark corners, they found an
old, rusty robot that was lying on the floor, twitching spasmodically.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Poor
UUNet,&quot; said the technician. &quot;I should have known&#133;the strain was just too
much for him.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;How long will
it take to repair him?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Ah, hell,
sir&#133;this is an ancient model. It could take days just to get the right parts.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">McQuaid thought of
all the red lights blinking upstairs, lights representing lives that were on hold, all
because an old robot had gone to pieces at the worst possible time.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Do the best you
can,&quot; he told the technician. With a sigh, he turned and began to climb the ladder.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Where are you
going, sir?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;To the
bar,&quot; said the gnome. &quot;I need a stiff drink.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Smedley did
eventually recover his sanity. Living underground with robots and technicians for long
periods of time can place a terrible strain upon even the strongest mind. But he was
right, the world is not perfect. On the other hand, it could be much worse.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">So, when faced with
the noisome problems of lag or packet loss, you may rest assured that the gnomes are on
it. When your world crashes, when your life gets locked up, you may take comfort in the
fact that the world is in the hands of a bunch of tired gnomes on the verge of insanity,
struggling day and night to make sure that the world keeps working.</font></font></p>
