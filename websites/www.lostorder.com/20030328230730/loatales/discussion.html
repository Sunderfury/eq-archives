<p align=left><b>The Discussion</b><br><i>by Mary</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The back room was dimly lit but the occupants had no trouble recognizing the problem. It was the solution that eluded them. </p>

<p align=left>"Whatever shall we do about Mary?" Sally practically sobbed. The concern in her voice was heart wrenching and the others could only mirror he despair.</p>

<p align=left>"It is not poor Mary. 'Tis the other one…Maria is the evil one. She is the source." Jack hissed. The others murmured in agreement. They all knew the woman child Mary was an innocent puppet in the hands of a cruel and maniacal master. The child would never knowingly harm anyone but that did not help matter at all. It simply made this discussion even more difficult. </p>

<p align=left>"We can not let our feelings for Mary the child to cloud our judgement." Leo growled. "The fact remains the girl is ill and not in control of her actions. She is a danger to herself and others. She must be stopped." Nods of the affirmative and sighs of helpless frustration arose from the crowd. </p>

<p align=left>"Aye. Me hates to say it mateys but me thinks the lass needs to walk 'der plank. Argh…" Patch surmised, adding a dramatic throat slashing motion for empathizes. </p>

<p align=left>The ladies in the room grew pale and looked as though they may faint. Horrified whispers permeated the room from all sides. This can not be. There must be another way. Are we actually suggesting murder? Has Mary's madness spread to us? How can we even discuss killing our friend? The room was a mass of confusion as panic dominated their thoughts. Then one voice spoke up. </p>

<p align=left>"Nay. I say nay, pirate. The girl must be brought to justice. Let the courts decide her fate." A hush fell over the room as the patrons considered Roland's words. </p>

<p align=left>"Don't be a fool, knight. Do you honestly believe the she demon that lives within the child will ever allow her to be tried for the crimes she herself makes the girl commit?" An old one-armed warrior roared. The paladin looked dejected and lowered his head in defeat. </p>

<p align=left>Silverwind stepped from the shadows and cleared his throat to speak. The silver white mane for which he was named glistened ethereally in the firelight. Never one for public speaking the youth shook his head sadly and shuffled his feet. All eyes were upon him and this only helped to heighten his agitation. Still he must say what is on his mind and in his heart </p>

<p align=left>"Friends…please, we all care for Mary. She is sweet and loving child. A more gentle soul you will never find, of this I am sure. Yet this does not change the truth. There is a darkness that surrounds dear Mary, an evil that deceives the girl and clouds her mind." </p>

<p align=left>Silverwind's big brown eyes filled with tears and he struggled to continue. "This evil must be expelled. We can not sit idly by while the shadow consumes the child. Maria…Maria MUST be destroyed…even…even…if it means Mary's destruction as well."</p>

<p align=left>The room grew silent. The anguish in the air was felt by all. That was it then. The doubts and fears of everyone in the place had finally been brought to light. The severity of the realization left the members in a thought numbing shock. After what seemed an eternity, a glowing figure moved to the center of the room. An unearthly, musical voice brought the others out of their trance. </p>

<p align=left>"Listen to yourselves," the angelic voice scolded. "You call yourselves her friends yet you speak about her as if she is more vile than the very dirt beneath your feet." The radiant maiden turned to catch the paladin's gaze from across the room. </p>

<p align=left>"You speak of Justice, sir Knight, but is not Compassion the greatest virtue of all? Would you have us sacrifice charity and love in the name of righteousness?" The knight looked as though an arrow had pierced his heart. There was no answer in his grief struck eyes as he bowed his head. His face was wet with tears. The woman's elegant features softened as she turned to speak again…</p>

<p align=left>The door burst open as Mary bounced into the room. The girl was laughing merrily as she smiled at her friends. The child's eyes lit with glee as she scanned the room. </p>

<p align=left>"Hello e'erbody. I done with my chores now." She giggled. </p>

<p align=left>Mary spotted the beautiful maiden standing in the center of the room and went over immediately to greet her. "Hello pretty Angel lady," Mary said pleasantly, "How are you today?" She asked. </p>

<p align=left>The woman smiled back at Mary silently. Then the child noticed Sir Roland seated at the table in the corner and frowned. </p>

<p align=left>"Whats the matter Mr. 'olan, you look sad." Mary crossed the room to look closer at the knight "Mr. 'olan?" The noble knight did not reply but seemed to sag in his chair and hang his head in shame. For a moment the girl thought he was crying but that is silly-brave knights don't cry. </p>

<p align=left>Then Jack popped up from his table in the back and Mary laughed in delight. "Mr. Jack!" She shrieked. Running to the table, Mary wrapped her arms around his neck and hugged him happily. </p>

<p align=left>"Hello Mr. Jack. I am so glad you feelin' better…me know you was sick but now you not." The girl placed a cool hand on Jack's forehead. "Nope, nope. No febers or nothin'. You the bestest now." She smiled. Jack returned her smile with one of his own and nodded his head up and down assuring her of his recovery.</p>

<p align=left>"Mary…" came her mother's voice from the other room. "Mary dear, it's time for bed. Put your toys away and go to sleep now." </p>

<p align=left>"Yes, momma," the girl sighed. Mary pushed down gently on Jack's head and closed the lid on his box, making sure to clasp the latch so he would not accidentally pop back out in the night. "G'nite, Jack." </p>

<p align=left>She went back to Sir Roland and placed him astride his magnificent white stallion Silverwind. Maybe that is why he is sad she thought. A knight always rides his pretty horsie. Walking to back to the middle of the room, Mary picked up Angel doll where she had fallen and lay her on the satin pillow of her little doll bed. "Sweet dreams Angel lady." Mary whispered. </p>

<p align=left>The child changed into her nightgown, grabbed Ben her old one-armed Teddy bear, and climbed into bed herself. Hugging the bear tightly, she glanced around the playroom one last time to make sure her friends were safe for the night. Smiling contently, she blew out the candle and went to sleep. </p>
