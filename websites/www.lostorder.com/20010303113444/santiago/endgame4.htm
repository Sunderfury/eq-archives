<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Master,
I am cold! Can we not leave this place?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Not until we
find what we&#146;re looking for,&quot; said Rothan, calmly scanning the wintry horizon.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Master, I am a
fire elemental. FIRE elemental. Fire is warm. Fire likes being in places that are warm.
This place is not warm. This place is COLD!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Ignoring the whining
of his familiar, Rothan walked over to where a young woman kneeled, examining the ground.
His eyes drifted over her graceful form with undisguised admiration. She was the most
beautiful creature he had ever seen.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;And just what
do you think you&#146;re looking at?&quot; she asked playfully, without turning toward
him.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Oh,
nothing,&quot; Rothan smiled and walked to her side. &quot;Find anything yet?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Eshay shook her head.
&quot;Wolves, polar bears, spiders &#150; not much else out here.&quot; She stood up.
&quot;Rothan, are you sure you want to go through with this? Halas could be days away,
yet.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The mage nodded.
&quot;I have to find the Shaman. If what I&#146;ve been told is true, he may be the only
one who can help. I just hope we find him before we freeze out here.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Are you
cold?&quot; she asked with mock incredulity. She drew closer to him. &quot;Is there
anything I might be able to do that would warm you up?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well, I can
think of one or two things&#133;&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">She smiled, and
kissed her husband.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Oh, this is
ridiculous,&quot; said the elemental. &quot;Here I am, out in the middle of nowhere,
freezing to death. And they&#146;re kissing! Well, that does it. That&#146;s the last
straw. I&#146;m leaving. Good-bye, Master!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Rothan was still
kissing Eshay, and took no notice of the elemental.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I said,
&#145;Good-bye, Master!&#146;&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Rothan waved in
farewell.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The elemental floated
away, sulking and muttering to himself. &quot;Worthless, two-bit mage. Not even powerful
enough to summon a real elemental. We&#146;ll see how well he does without me. I bet
he&#146;ll be calling my name within seconds.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He stopped and
listened, but there was no call.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well, maybe not
yet, but soon. He&#146;ll realize what a fool he was to let me go. And then he&#146;ll
come crawling back to me. And you know what I&#146;ll do? I&#146;ll laugh. I&#146;ll laugh
at him! I&#146;ll&#133;aaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="left"><font color="#0080C0">Rothan
pulled away from Eshay. &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; he asked.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It was
nothing,&quot; she said. &quot;Only the wind.&quot; She began to kiss him again.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Master!&quot;
cried the elemental, floating toward Rothan as fast as he could. &quot;Master!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I thought you
left,&quot; said Rothan.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Master,
there&#146;s a giant out there!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;A giant?&quot;
asked Eshay, drawing her sword.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Yes! What did I
just say? Am I speaking Common?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;What did this
giant look like?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well, he was
tall, for one thing. He carried a great big club, and had a giant polar bear skull on his
head! What in the blazes does it matter what he looked like&#133;we have to get out of
here, now!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;All right, all
right,&quot; said Rothan. &quot;Just calm down.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Too late!&quot;
screamed the elemental. &quot;There he is!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">All eyes turned in
terror as the creature approached them.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Hello,
there,&quot; said the giant. &quot;My name is Greyhawk. Um, is everything all right?&quot;</font></font></p>
