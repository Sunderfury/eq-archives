: Well I am very good at speaking about virtue but I know what it means in a 
: practical sense I think. And if I was better with words I would make a more clever 
: comment here. But since I am not I just want to say that this man has really understood

: Man, I just can't help quoteing a famous book here:

: 13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, 
: wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, 
: and to be trodden under foot of men. 
: 14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
: 15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; 
: and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. 
: 16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, 
: and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
: (Matt 5, 13-16)
