<p align=left><b>Compassion</b><br><i>by Smogg Azalin</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It is with despair, I must share this sad truth. The truth of how Britannia lost a one of the eight virtues.
I was in the Medical Archive, tending a patient with large wounds from dragon claws. It was then a bat arrived and dropped a message:</p>

<p align=left>"I am not sure where I am! Two men came and arrested me in Trinisic at the bank. They forced me through a Moongate. Took my regs and runes and jailed me! - Anna"</p>

<p align=left>I was shocked, as Anna is my most promising student of healing and medicine. I soon made inquirers and found that no official arrest order had been made. For days we searched for her with no result. Only too late we discovered a filthy place in Wintermoor called the black pit. We approached as her cries of help cut though the frosty air.
I then rushed in with my most trusted Guard, Baratus, and a horrible sight met us. Anna was trapped in a small area where she could barely move. </p>

<p align=left>"SMOGG !" She yelled. "HELP !".</p>

<p align=left>Gromph, The Sage of Compassion sat comfortably in a chair behind the first wall of bars. And that is when the lies began. </p>

<p align=left>"She want to stay" Gromph insisted. "She came here willingly" he went on.</p>

<p align=left>No words by Anna, myself or anyone else could change his mind. He insisted coldly at keeping her. Her eyes were full of despair. I could see she had suffered and I could only with horror imagine what he was putting her through. What kind of perverted thoughts was he filling her mind with? I feared the worst. My next visit was more terrible than I could have expected. Only glimpses of her old self could be heard. She was now filled with anger and hatred toward the virtues, especially compassion. It was obvious that the sage was destroying everything good in her. His vile and cruel treatment had turned her into a shadow of herself. What kind of compassion is this?</p>

<p align=left>Compassion has little meaning now. It lost.</p>

<p align=left>I strongly hope for support from anyone that values the Virtues and has Compassion. Stop this depraved sage in his vile deeds while time still is.
