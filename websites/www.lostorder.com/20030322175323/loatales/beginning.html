<p align=left><b>New Beginnings</b><br><i>by "the record keeper"</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The hunchbacked figure leaned in the corner of the room, slouched over his desk like a starving dog guarding his last meal. His pale skin looked almost ghostly by the light of the single candle. His shaking hand dipped the quill into the well of ink, and he touched it to the yellow parchment.....</p>

<p align=left>The tall figure finally found the strength to stand, and like a newborn calf he shakily surveyed the land around him. Rolling green hills, trees, fresh air, it was all so familiar. The smells though, and the sounds, reminded him just how different it all was.</p>

<p align=left>He slowly pulled the hood of his robe away from his face, revealing a new sun.</p>

<p align=left>Again, he was a stranger in a strange land, and had to start anew.</p>

<p align=left>He felt magic in this land. That was good. He also felt danger in this land. That was not good, but it was not like he hadn't grown accustomed to danger by now in his many lives.</p>

<p align=left>The stranger walked cautiously for a while until he found a road. Then he followed that road until it led him to a town. He could see others in this town in their daily routine.. conducting life in this strange new world that was as old as time to them.</p>

<p align=left>He walked into this town to learn as much as he could, because he knew, he had a lot to learn.</p>

<p align=left>The hunched figure stood, and went to the shelves across the room for more parchment and ink. Apparently, this was going to be quite a long story.....</p>
