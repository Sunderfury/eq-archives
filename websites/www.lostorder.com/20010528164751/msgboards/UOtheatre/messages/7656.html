<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">I suppose ye remember what a Balron is.<p><br><IMG src="http://uo.stratics.com/hunters/Pics/balron.gif"><p>We started with a warm up walk to the Terathan Keep. I won't go into all that right now, but as far as I can tell some must have liked the warm up quite a bit. Though we started with about twelve bold adventurers entering the Keep, by the time we recalled back to Papua and were ready for the Balrons, only about half were left: Balor Darkshaw, Ettne d'Ambre, Taeren of Wodclf, Drifter: [Lord Warrior, S&M], Travis: [Lord, S&M], and of course meself.<p>As most adventures start, so did this one.<p>Talesn of Wodclf: Vas Rel Por - Gate Travel<br>Balor Darkshaw: where you going<br>Talesn of Wodclf: Terathan tower, (In Lor - Night Sight)<p>Talesn of Wodclf: BALRON XPRESS!<p>We enter with a bang.<p>Ettne d'Ambre: In Jux Hur Ylem - Blade Spirits<p>an ophidian warrior:  Thaithath ath.

They have just gone underground.<p>Travis: Come milady<br>Taeren of Wodclf: Corp Por - Energy Bolt<br>Ettne d'Ambre: Vas Ort Flam - Explosion<br>Drifter: Vas Ort Flam - Explosion<p>an ophidian warrior:  Missalstis!

(Stepping out of the Balroon room.)<br>I see: an ophidian warrior, an ophidian corpse, an ophidian knight-errant, and an ophidian corpse (At least they are not all alive.)<br>You see an ophidian warrior attacking Schleb! a terathan avenger, a terathan warrior, a blade spirit(Whatever.)<p>Talesn of Wodclf: Kal Por Ylem - Mark (Hey it such a fine spot I just want to be able to recall back into the thick of it.)<br> <br>Balor Darkshaw: An Lor Xen - Invisibility<br>Balor Darkshaw: stay there<br>You see an ophidian enforcer attacking Drifter!<p>I see: the Collector of Souls (Well, not to fear then, Balrons STILL DO spawn here.

Yssessith ssasasthy. Bad aim! <p>It wishes, no doubt. These encounters don't last long. Not even long enough for us to mount an attack on the Collector. Enforcers aren't that hard anyway. They are the lieutenants of the Ophidian warrior ranks, and these are just a pinch tougher than the regular warriors.<p>Travis: Ooo OO OO OoOo OoOO<br>Taeren of Wodclf: dear Travis<p>There is an attempt to resurrect Travis, Lord of S&M<br>Talesn of Wodclf: An Corp - Resurrection.

It is just not possible for the uncoordinated Steel & Magic Monster Bashers to take this Balron down this way. I found an ancient and much dog-eared text on Balrons. Here are some interesting passages:<p>"Tactics for killing: Melee combat is *absolutely* futile and will only get you quickly killed. The most efficient way to kill a balron is to to trap it... Find natural formations in the dungeon the balron is in (rocks, stalagmites, etc), and get it trapped on the other side of it. Once the balron is stuck, let it spend all of its mana trying to attack you (but be prepared to heal!). Once it casts only level one spells (magic arrows, feeblemind,etc.), or Evaluating Intelligence reveals that it has less than 4% mana remaining (roughly 20 mana - enough to dispel), cast energy vortices and/or blade spirits beside it, and let them duke it out. It usually takes two vortices, or up to eight blade spirits, to kill a balron. To keep your blades and vortices alive longer, cast reactive armor on them. Also, casting poison on the balron early on will keep its life slowly draining away, making your job a bit easier."<p>Now I have to warn ye, this old text was written long ago. Even before th' Renaissance and the discovery of Trammel. Some parts of the text may no longer be accurate, if they ever were.. For example, ye may notice that Balrons are not bothered by poison. Further trapping one is most difficult, since they have gained greatly in intelligence since the days of old when I first hunted them.<p>But I digress.<p>** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *<p>I see an ophidian enforcer and play my music, inciting anger, and it begins to look furious, but my music fails to incite enough anger. If you have ever studied the Bards's enchantments you know what that means. YEOW!<p>I see a terathan avenger, an energy vortex and the Collector of Souls, which is attacking Travis! So I play My hypnotic music, stopping the battle.<p>[Ettne d'Ambre]: I was killed by the Collector of Souls !!<p>Opening door... I see the Collector of Souls attacking Taeren of Wodclf, and Schleb, and Ettne d'Ambre doin th' OoOo thing.<br> <br>Travis: WHEW!
