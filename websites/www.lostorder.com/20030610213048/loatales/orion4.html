<blockquote>
<p align=left>Them lugians ain't as tough as I thought, but they sure be ugly. There I was huntin' outside of Lin, and I found all sorts of lugian breedin' grounds. Seems that lugians prefer to keep their distance from other creatures, probably 'cause they're so darn ugly. So, most of 'em hurl giant rocks at anyone who comes near 'em. But I figured out a way to counter their attack....I call it the "lugian shuffle". What I do is shoot 'em with me crossbow, then quickly shuffle to the side to avoid the incomin' rocks. Them lugians be pretty dumb too, 'cause they jest stand there throwin' rocks while I shoot 'em full of quarrels.</p>

<p align=left>I headed back to Lin to sell me loot, and received word that Gwenneth was organizin' a huntin' party out near Zaikhal. I wouldn't miss a chance to see her again, so I started packin' me supplies. Next thing I know, that crazy magi Kileyan shows up out of nowhere and says he's lookin' fer some adventure too. So, we wait fer Gwenneth in town, and plan our trip.</p>

<p align=left>Now I ain't too familiar with dungeons, but Gwenn has been collectin' all sorts of rumors, and says we're headin' to a place called the "Hall of the Helm". Sure enough, it's full of them undead creatures. In we go, rippin' through zombies at every corner. O'course, the zombies were jest the beginnin'. Jest as things we're goin' fine, we find the liches. To me, a lich be a perfect example of why people shouldn't practice bloody magicks. Them wicked creatures cast some of the most awful magicks I'd ever seen, and painful magicks too.</p>

<p align=left>After a little while, Tasslehof himself joins us in the dungeon, showin' off his new green armor. I used to think he was an honest bloke, but now he's castin' them bloody spells jest like Kileyan and has this funny look in his eye. He was kind enough to lend me some of them frog crotch quarrels though, which work pretty well fer tearin' apart the undead.</p>

<p align=left>Down we went, deeper into the dungeon, unsure of what was ahead of us. We entered a large room and all of a sudden, I see some lich runnin' straight at us. Only it wasn't a normal lich, it was the Guardian of the Helm, nastiest lich I'd ever seen. M'lady Gwenneth, brave as she is, attacks the guardian with her flamin' cestus as meself and the other fellows look on with our jaws dropped open. Me and Tass start shootin' it full of holes, and then things turn ugly. That bloody guardian starts castin' all sorts of wicked magicks at us, and I feel this sharp pain in me chest as me armor starts leakin' blood. Luckily fer us, Kileyan was able to cast his healin' magicks and kept us alive. We held our ground, and soon the guardian was no longer.</p>

<p align=left>We never did find any helm though. Methinks one of them other graverobbers there swiped it while we were mendin' our wounds. No matter though, it was quite an adventure to say the least. And we learned a thing or two 'bout huntin' liches. At least I learned I ain't ready fer their magicks, not yet anyway.</p>
