<p align=left><b>For Jared's Love</b><br><i>by Sally</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Jared my love,</p>

<p align=left>I will do anything for you and two people have led met to the path of ...hmmm..what did they call them?...vices..no that wasn't it...hmmm...vultures...close...but that wasn't it either...*thinks real hard*...*smiles* virtues..that was them. A proper young man Elrios and a lady named Tara informed me what a Paladin like you is looking for in a "Lady". So in taking their advice, I am giving up me only trade that I know and will be becoming a seamstress and with their help be led to the path of the light. </p>

<p align=left>However, for you ladies out there that want to spice things up a bit...I can't let all of me years of hard work go to waste...so I will be creating a new line of clothes to help you keep your Paladin happy. So look for the new line of clothes under the lable of "Sally of Yew". Perhaps if the villagers allow me ... we could have a fashion show sometime in the future to launch me new career.</p>

<p align=left>Just keep in mind Jared...I would never have change me ways if I did not think I had a chance of you becoming me love.</p>
