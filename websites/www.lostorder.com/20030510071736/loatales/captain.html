<blockquote>
<p align=left>Captain's Log: Harvestgrain 23, 10 P.Y.</p>
 
<p align=left>Don't know why I'm still writin' this bloody log, I've not the foggiest idea
what happened to me ship after that blasted purple lightin' hit it. One
minute I'm fighting a storm, the next layin' in the middle of a grove of
trees. At any rate I may as well keep this log, just in case it becomes
important.</p>

<p align=left>When I came too I was standing just on the out skirts of a town named
Holtburg. Not a bad little town, but she's nothing compared to Skara Brea
if ye ask me. Still a nice place, nice and open and spread out. I sought
out the local eatery and spent the last of me gold on a fine mug of stout.
Some of the best I've had in a long time. Where ever I am, they sure know a
thing or two about brewin' a good drink.</p>

<p align=left>This place is strange though, I feel like things work different here. It
actually took me a few minutes to get me land legs back (or was it the ale
workin' on me, I don't rightly know) Still, I've been usin' a bow almost as
long as I've been holdin' a tiller, and it took me a good few minutes to get
a bloody arrow notched in me bow again. Looks like I'm going to have to
spend some time huntin' rabbits again before I wander to far into trouble.</p>

<p align=left>I heard some rumors today that there's a city to the south of here where
there might be some more LOA. I'll have to start there after I finish
another one of these stouts.</p>

<p align=left>This place is a little stranger than I thought. Today I started to make me
way south along the road. I managed to "aquire" a map of the lands from a
fellow customer at Fispur's Foodstuffs. Poor fellow can't 'old his ale to
save his life.</p>

<p align=left>Along the way I ran into the local welcome party. A little group of what I
later learned were called Drudges. The first thing I thought when I saw one
was, "ohmygod, all the cats I killed as a lad have come back on two legs to
kill me." An that's what they did all right, twice I found myself back in
the same bloody clearin' near Holtburg, till I finnaly figured out which end
of the arrow goes on the sting (reminder: pointy end in the other man)
After a good deal of runnin' and a full quiver of arrows, I finally made it
to the village of Glenden Wood.</p>

<p align=left>This was a much nicer town in me humble opinion, as the ale was of an even
more astounding quality. I lingered here a while taking in the view. This
village is nestled in a tree covered valley at the interceton of the west,
north and south roads. It has everything a well to do adventurer might
want, including the tavern, two bowyers and even a mage.</p>

<p align=left>I tried to head south again, but found myself doging all sorts of beasties,
such as giant wasps of the like I've never seen, beasties that look a cross
between a cat and a troll, and bloody land sharks! Needless to say I'll be
staying the night here before i head on to the next village in me way, er,
along me path. Tomorrow its on to Cragstone.</p>
