<p align=left><b>The Grand Conjunction</b><br><i>by Smogg Azalin</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The old sage ran his fingers across the books. The light in the ancient library was poor and the titles were covered in a layers of dusts. His fingers continued across the endless rows of books upon books.
Finally he paused, he had touched a book. The Grand Conjunction. This was the answer. Now he would know the truth and the future. With eager he made haste towards a desk with a nearly burned down candle. He instantly began to read.</p>

<p align=left>" … and when the stars are right, the darkness divided will reunite. Virtues will be but memories of the dead, and sunlight will fail to penetrate the sky.</p>

<p align=left>There will be signs and warning before the new era. Dark chants will fill air, the dead will rise from their graves, paladins will loose their faith, waters will turn red, a new diseases will spread through every city, and chaos will emerge from every corner of the world as the…"</p>

<p align=left>A pain pulsed through the brain of the old sage. He closed his eyes a moment and it seems to help. The waves of pain soon died and he was able to focus on the book once more.</p>

<p align=left>"… only by completing a ritual will the fate of the world be sealed. The ritual is a horrible ceremony that will combine intense feelings of hatred, love, fear, passion, horror, insanity and death into one, mocking all human values and virtues. In that ritual two souls of darkness will unite. Souls made of the same essence. Their thoughts will be the same and their hearts will beat as one…."</p>

<p align=left>The pain intensified in the brain of the sage, as he looked up from the book, a purple liquid seemed to drift through the air. The library was not what it seemed, and as he looked back into the book, the pages they seemed more pink than white.</p>

<p align=left>"… to prevent the disaster, the priest must first read the incarnations in the back. Then he must…"</p>

<p align=left>The letters seemed to drift across the pages and the sage heard distant voices and the sound of armor. He was barely able to make out the voices.</p>

<p align=left>"Captain, that is the sage, he is obviously suffering" a soft but evil voice spoke.</p>

<p align=left>"Guards, grab him and bring him along" a female boomed in cruel tone.</p>

<p align=left>The sage was dragged out of the library while a few younger scribes were unable to speak or decide what actions to take. The single candle burned its last seconds, and the area around the desk was soon covered in
shadows. A dark figure placed his hand on the ancient book…</p>

<p align=left>Smogg stood at the roof of his tower observing the stars. He then turned towards Anna, The Dark Princess. "This is what they have in store for us...the stars."</p>

<p align=left>He passed her an ancient book while his evil smile met hers. </p>
