    <font size="4"><p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;Where you from?&quot; asked the troll
    captain.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">The dwarf made no response, but glared at his jailors.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;Why you come to swamp?&quot; asked the troll captain.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">Silence.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;Bet you sorry you come to swamp. Any more littles in
    swamp?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">Silence.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;ANY MORE LITTLES IN SWAMP?&quot; the troll captain yelled.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;He not say nothing,&quot; said Zulaan. &quot;I tell you so.
    He stubborn. Me torture now?&quot; He smiled with eager hope.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;Me give one last chance. Little tell us nothing, you
    torture little. Little still tell us nothing, little get sliced up. Bit by bit. Then we
    eat while he watch.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;I&#146;ll not tell you anything!&quot; shouted the dwarf.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">This was music to the ears of Zulaan, who began to hop up and
    down with glee. &quot;Me torture now?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;You torture now.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">Zulaan did a little dance. &quot;Me go get tools!&quot; He ran
    off down the cavern.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;You be sorry you say nothing,&quot; said the troll captain.
    &quot;Zulaan good at torture. He like torture. You die slow.&quot; The captain spotted
    another troll walking by. &quot;Hucaluk!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">Hucaluk froze. &quot;Me no do it! Me innocent!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;You not in trouble. Me have job for you. You guard
    prisoner. Me go get halfling sandwich.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;Me guard good!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;You better. Dwarf maybe know something. You keep dwarf
    alive. Me come back soon.&quot; The troll captain departed.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;Captain ask Hucaluk for help!&quot; thought Hucaluk.
    &quot;Me important now!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">The dwarf began to chuckle.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;Why you laugh, little?&quot; asked Hucaluk. &quot;You crazy
    now?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;I am laughing, stupid troll, because you and your friends
    will never get any information out of me. I have in my belt a self-destruct mechanism that
    was given to me by a gnome. In a few seconds, I will die, and my secrets will die with me.
    For the glory of Brell Serilis!&quot; There was a small explosion, and Hucaluk was knocked
    off his feet.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">When he got up, he saw little dwarf bits lying everywhere.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#00FF00">&quot;This no good. This look bad for Hucaluk. Guards think me
    let dwarf die. Me better run back to swamp, while me still can!&quot;</font></font></p>
