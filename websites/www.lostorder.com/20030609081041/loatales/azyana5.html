<blockquote>
<p align=left>The past two nights we continued my lessons. I learned the uses of Stun and Yalup.
Stun can be used to keep a creature from moving so that I can cast a spell or it can be used to stop a creature from running. Although I tried last night to use it I wasn't successful but this eve out of all the creatures I killed I think I did it once correctly in both circumstances. Yaulp was a new spell he gave me this eve. Some how it adds to your strength and makes you harder to hit. He said that you could cast it as many times as you want during a battle. So I did. I am still not sure about it but I will continue to use it more to please him that anything else.</p>

<p align=left>What else did I learn… Oh, kicking and biting are not dignified. I forget what I was up against but I kicked it. It was better than trying to stun it. The look on his face showed his displeasure with it but I swear it helped. Tonight I was up against a mummy, which of course is very tall, and I figured if I couldn't kick it he said nothing else so I bit its kneecap. Nothing seems to pass his watchful eyes since while I was meditating he tells me that biting is just as bad as kicking.</p>

<p align=left>I also learned not to kill orcs. I had run out last night and fetched an orc and he asked me why. I just told him because it was within my ability. He then told me to stop hitting it and he cast Atone on it to make it forget. He told me that that there are many orcs across the lands an they would make my life difficult so it would be best to leave them alone. Well, to test this out I ran around an Orc Warrior and he was right as always it paid me no mind. </p>

<p align=left>Last night in-between the killing and meditating we took a moment to look at the rising moon. It was beautiful - a pale white moon and the sky around it in blue, yellow and a little green from the reflection of the ground. He slipped his arm around me and I felt ever so safe. Then it was back to meditating and on with my lessons.</p>

<p align=left>Again this eve he talked of going to Unrest. I have heard of that place and I know it is across the ocean. I would truly like to learn how to hunt there but he will be away from his hunting companions. I would not like it if he would end up regretting leaving them just to further my education. Maybe after I hunt more I could travel there myself. </p>

<p align=left>Another thing I learned this eve is that everything will come when I am older. My spells will last longer, my spells will be more effective, I can meditate and not have to have my head buried so far into my book, I will be able to bring back my friends who have fallen… I swear everything will be when I am older. I have attained the next circle in just the few nights under his teachings, so I will be able to get older at least.</p>

<p align=left>Right after I reached the 16th circle he gave me my Christmas present. It was in a bag with some magical powers to it that makes things inside weigh less. I peeked into the package and saw a ring. It adds to my wisdom much better than the one I had been wearing. He is so kind to me. I hope I will learn my lessons well and make him proud. No sooner than I could thank him then it was time for him to leave again. We said our good byes and as always he disappeared into the night.</p>

<p align=left>Still holding onto the bag Mundayn gave me I decided to head to the bank to put it safely away. Back into the water I went and swam back. I swear people were looking at me strange as I passed by but he said it was the safest route and I would improve my swimming skills so I kept on, only stopping to heal someone that was in need. The bag safely away I am still sitting in the corner here at the bank. It is late. I think I will go to that inn I saw and rest.</p>
