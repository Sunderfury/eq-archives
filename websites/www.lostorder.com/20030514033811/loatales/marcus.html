<p align=left><b>Scars of the Past</b><br><i>by Marcus of Gorath</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The embers of the campfire glow red hot, as if raging against the new light of the morning. Morning in Yew used to be so peaceful. One could hear the birds sing, the great hinds calling for a mate, bears striking the water for a fish, all with the sound of the wind behind it. This is how it used to be. </p>

<p align=left>A rough looking man sits up from his bedroll along side the dying campfire. Running his hands through his hair, we can see him awakening to a new day. His armor lay along side him, set out in order for re-equiping. Quite a few scars adorn his body, as well as a handful of fresh wounds. He is numb to them now. He does not feel, does not care about the wounds, just the result. Each of those wounds came in a fight that ended in victory. He thinks of them as trophies, spoils of war. All the scars, but one that is. A deep scar runs along his face, over his right eye. The man gets up and walks the short distance to the water. As he splashes water on his face, he sees his reflection, and that scar. He can't help but remember.....</p>

<p align=left>"To arms! To arms! They attack!!!" The cry rang throughout the camp. The Ophidians have long since terrorized the New Lands, and none knew this more than the nomadic tribe of Gorath. Fierce warriors, men and women alike, made up this tribe, and had long been enemies with the Ophidians. As the warriors rushed to meet the oncoming horde, a young boy ran out of his tent to grab a weapon. Marcus was his name. Even at age 10 he showed promise of perhaps being Goraths future leader. He had no fear, and would gladly look death in the eye just to prove he could. But despite the promise, at age 10, he was just a boy. </p>

<p align=left>As the Ophidians clashed with the tribe, the screams and hisses of the combatants rang out in the early morning. Bodies of both sides cluttered the blood stained ground. Young Marcus could no longer sit idle with the other children, and grabbed a club from the ground. He rushed an Ophidian that was begining to claim advantage over a warrior, and swung with all his might. The mighty serpent looked hurt by the blow, but not abundantly so. The snake lashed his hand at the young boy, cutting his face deeply. The boy fell to the ground in pain, and soon fell unconcious. The warrior beside him soon lost his fight, and landed upon the child, covering him from view.</p>

<p align=left>The rain beat down upon the corpes of man and snake alike. The tribe of Gorath had been wiped out. The tide had turned against them as another group of Ophidians joined the fray. From within the lifeless scene, a hand is seen attempting to push its way out. A human body is pushed aside, and the young boy stands, very unsure of what has happened. A deep wound marks his face, and shall stay there for eternity. Upon realization of what has occured, Marcus raises his hands to the sky and yells, tears running down his face......</p>

<p align=left>That is the last time tears have flown down his face, the last time sorrow or emotion was shown. Marcus is shaken back into reality, and continues to wash up. He makes his way back to camp and dons his armor. Marcus straps on his shield, puts his helmet in his pack, and lastly grabs his bloodied war mace. An impossing figure stands before us, war tested, and half dead. It is the latter feature that makes him most dangerous. He makes his way to the highway, preparing for quite a walk. He goes to the battle ground, to fight a new horde of evil. He goes to Trinsic. Here, the last of his tribe, Marcus of Gorath will stand, with eyes of steel and a heart of iron, ready to look death in the eye once again, just to prove he can.
