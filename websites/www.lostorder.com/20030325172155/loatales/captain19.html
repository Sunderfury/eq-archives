<blockquote>
<p align=left>I’ve been in Dereth a full year now. I must say, in that time I’ve come to find this place as home to me as the one I left. Still I miss the salty air and warm tropic breezes that filled my sails. Though anything would be preferable to the strange weather that’s befallen the realm. All last winter there was hardly a flake of snow of the ground. Now we’re not even past the reap and the whole place is covered with the stuff.</p>

<p align=left>The cold rain that started when I arrived in Glenden Wood last week never abated. Instead it turned itself to snow. In fact the snow’s continuing to fall over the place. I’ve also heard rumors of snowmen walkin’ around and flinging shards of ice at travelers on the road. I’ll have to check into it fer Joxer and the Order, if I could only get over this blasted cold!</p>
