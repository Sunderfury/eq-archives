<p align=left><b>The Camp</b><br><i>by Alavon Highwind</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The orc captian dropped heavily onto the forest floor, an arrow protruding from its back.
Alavon walked up to the fallen monster, searched through its belongings for anything of interest, 
went down to one knee. "They must be close." thought Alavon. He had heard tale of an orc camp in 
the area, and had come to clear the forest of these wretched beings. He had already tracked and 
killed two other orcs, but knew that with each one, he was nearing the camp. Gazing deep into the 
thick forest, he makes out the glow of light. "Finally." thinks Alavon. He silently makes his way
along the path to the creatures, not even the sound of a broken twig accompanied him. Alavon had 
gotten quite good at fighting in his short time of training, but the ego a young man is still present
in the most talented of men. The camp sight came into view, and Alavon at that moment knew that he
should get help from a friend. A troll, an Orc Lord, an orc, and an orc mage. How naive youth can be...</p>

<p align=left>Alavon stayed hidden in the brush of a moment, trying to organize a plan of attack. All the
creatures seemed to be patroling the area, looking for men such as Alavon. "Glad I didn't bring gold."
thought Alavon, as the troll sniffed the area. Alavon looked for a weakness, a place to begin his attack.
It was then that he noticed an open wound in the side of the orc mage. He had been injured by another.
The wound looked near fatal, just the opportunity that he needed. Alavon quietly drew his bow, nocking 
an arrow. He pulled back on the bow string, and aimed for the head of the mage. An elfs aim is rarely 
off, and this was no exception. The arrow struck its mark, and the orc mage barely had enough time to
grunt before he hit the ground, dead. The remaining enemies went into a frenzy looking for the archer.
"Three to one" thought Alavon. "I need to lessen their ranks." He shot another arrow, striking the orc
in the torso. Two more and the orc fell dead, however, in his attack he gave away his location. </p>

<p align=left>The Orc Lord charged as the troll lumbered behind. Thinking quickly, Alavon ran into the woods.
"I need to seperate them. Come on orc, chase me faster." Alavon ducked behind some brush as the Orc
Lord came near. Alavon shoots an arrows, hitting the orcs unarmored leg. The Orc Lord roars and charged
the brush, swinging his axe fiercly. Alavon wasn't expecting this quick of a response and couldn't react
in time. The Orc Lord lands a blow to the side of Alavon, the leather armor barely withstanding it. 
Alavon uses his bow to block the next blow, but in the same instant loses his weapon. The Orc Lord continues
his assualt upon Alavon. Alavon rolls out of the way of an overhead swind by the monster. The Orc Lord 
lunges at Alavon, who is face down on the ground. In that instant, Alavon rolls to his back, his kryss
drawn and pointed at the descending Orc Lord. The creature impales itself upon Alavons blade, cursing the
wood elf with it's last breath. Alavon slowly gets to his knees, his hand grabbing his side. He picks up
his bow. "Useless", and throws it to the ground. Alavon stands and begins to walk toward the clearing.
But the day is not yet won...</p>

<p align=left>From amongst the trees the troll swings his hammer, knocking the young lightbringer to the ground.
Sprawled upon the floor, Alavon instinctivly rolls to avoid the incoming strike of the troll. Quickly to his 
feet, despite the pain, Alavon rushes the troll, kryss drawn and ready, still dripping with the Orc Lords 
blood. He fights with the troll toe to toe for a few moments, landing blows, but taking more damage then 
he was giving. Blood running down his face, Alavon backs away from the fight and takes flight through the 
forest. Healthy, none could hope to outrun this lad, but injured as he was, even a troll could keep up. 
The troll was close to death, but sensed Alavon was closer to that fate and continued the hunt. Stumbling 
into the camp once again, he finds the dead body of a fighter. Not wishing to join him, Alavon keeps moving.
At the edge of the camp, Alavon sees a bow. It looks like shoddy craftsmanship, but it is a weapon none the less.
He picks up the bow while running still and reaches for an arrow. None, fallen from his pack in the fight. 
The troll lands a blow upon the back of Alavon, and sends him to the ground once again, onto the still warm 
body of the orc mage. The troll prepares for the killing blow, and lifts his hammer high above his head. 
Just as he prepares to strike, Alavon rolls over and fires, the arrow striking the troll in the head. The 
troll falls, dead. The arrow that killed the orc mage is now missing, only an open wound remains. </p>

<p align=left>Alavon crawls to an area of brush, away from the light of the fire. He collapses, beaten and battered,
but alive.... and victorious. Unfortunantly, a larger battle is about to take place for the young lightbringer,
one that will bring him closer to death than any mortal blow every could...</p>
