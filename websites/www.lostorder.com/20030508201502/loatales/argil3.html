<p align=left><b>The Candle</b><br><i>by Argil</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><i>In the cold empty cavern, a breeze picked up... and blew the light of the little candle out forever.</i></p>

<p align=left>* * * </p>

<p align=left>Solf still had nightmares about it.</p>

<p align=left>"If only I'd acted more quickly… if only I'd cast this spell rather than the other... if only I'd stepped in front of her... if only..."</p>

<p align=left>He shut his eyes against the pain of the memory, and the insistence of his conscience.</p>

<p align=left>There was nothing he could have done differently, of course. Intellectually he knew that. It was a miracle that he and his brethren had been able to stave off an attack of not one, not two, but TEN of the Indigo Brotherhood's best trained assassins that night years ago. The young Ranger had been the only casualty, and had died bravely, defending her guildmates to the last. They really should consider themselves fortunate not to have suffered further losses, he told himself firmly.</p>

<p align=left>Tell that to her, damnit, his soul screamed back at him.</p>

<p align=left>* * *</p>

<p align=left>And so he had returned to the scene of that long-ago battle, to the ancient fruit tree at whose foot they had interred her crumpled form. Its brown leaves rattled dryly like the ancient bones of fallen heroes. He sat with his back to the tree and covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p align=left>"Is there no place on Norrath where I may escape this prison of my conscience?" he said into the gloomy evening twilight.</p>

<p align=left>"No, friend, there is no place on Norrath..." a voice answered.</p>

<p align=left>It was perhaps indicative of his desperate state of mind that he did not find it odd to have his question answered.</p>

<p align=left>"So I must give up all hope, at the last." he murmured.</p>

<p align=left>A dry chuckle came from a few feet ahead of him. "Your horizons have indeed grown narrow, friend, if you believe this to be the only world available to you."</p>

<p align=left>There was something familiar about that voice. Something from long ago... something about... pirate ships...</p>

<p align=left>His hands flew away from his face as hope unlooked-for filled him. "Brim!"</p>

<p align=left>Brimstone chuckled again, and offered his friend a hand up. "Indeed, Solflexion, it is I. Too long it has been, friend."</p>

<p align=left>They gazed silently at each other for a few moments, gripping each other's shoulders, before the questions in Solf's mind began pouring onto his tongue.</p>

<p align=left>"But... how on Norrath...? Or rather, not on Norrath...? Where...? What did you mean...?"</p>

<p align=left>Brimstone smiled again, then composed his features and looked at his friend solemnly. </p>

<p align=left>"I cannot undo what is done, friend. That is beyond even my power. I am sorry to say that there is nowhere in this world where you will find solace from that which haunts you."</p>

<p align=left>"However, this is not the only world…"</p>

<p align=left>Solf's heart leaped.</p>

<p align=left>"There is another world, one where you may start anew. One where some of your brethren await you..."</p>

<p align=left>Solf whispered, beyond hope, "Joxer? Grewhawk? And... Gradishar? They are in this other world?"</p>

<p align=left>Brimstone smiled again. "All those and more, my friend. Remember Enosh, and Arathor, and... oh, too many to name one at a time. We have been expecting you."</p>

<p align=left>Solf locked eyes with his friend. "What must I do to make the transition?"</p>

<p align=left>Brim's eyes glinted mysteriously at him. "You must recover that which you almost lost, and pass it along to those who remain behind. They shall have need of it, without you."</p>

<p align=left>Solf's eyes dropped for a moment as he searched for Brimstone's meaning.</p>

<p align=left>To recover that which he had lost... no, ALMOST lost. What could it be? He had lost many comrades in arms over the years, experienced more good times than he could count, and lately more bad times than he cared to recall. He had lost enough platinum to sink a ship. He had lost his sobriety on more than one occasion, and as a direct result one bawdy evening in Freeport had lost his...</p>

<p align=left>He blushed and firmly squelched that line of thought. Concentrate, man...</p>

<p align=left>What had he almost lost, but never given up? He'd lost his temper on more than one occasion, so that certainly wasn't it. To be honest, he thought, lately he had caught himself succumbing to despair more often than he liked to admit, but he had never given up hope.</p>

<p align=left>He had never...</p>

<p align=left>He smiled.</p>

<p align=left>And Brimstone, seeing the confidence in his expression, echoed that smile.</p>

<p align=left>"It springs eternal in the human breast", he said to his friend. Then, turning, he inscribed several words into the air. The words hung there, letters of fire against the dark background of the night. Slowly then they faded, and the night overtook them both.</p>

<p align=left>Brimstone's smile broadened. "Exactly so, friend. And now, prepare yourself to answer a different Call..." He raised his arms then and rekindled the fiery words, fanning them to an impossible brilliance. They shared one last smile, then stepped into the flames together.</p>

<p align=left>* * *</p>

<p align=left>Argil slowly approached the large fruit tree. An early snowfall skittered around his feet. The tree's great branches seemed to weep now, slowly dropping leaves onto the charred spot around their roots.</p>

<p align=left>It had taken him days of hard travel to get from the Plains of Karana to the East Commonlands… but since that odd vision of several days ago, he had known he must make the journey.</p>

<p align=left>He had seen his old friend Solf, writing in letters of fire, which hung in the air. Strain as he might, his inner eye could not make out the words. Solf had then turned to him and raised a hand, as if in farewell…</p>

<p align=left>And then had been consumed totally by the flames.</p>

<p align=left>Argil gazed sorrowfully at the tree and the charred spot beneath it, saddened by the evidence that what he had seen had in fact been a death-vision. He felt privileged that his friend had vouchsafed him such a glimpse of the great beyond… and frustrated beyond words that he had been unable to read those flaming words. He was sure they contained a vital message his friend had been trying to convey.</p>

<p align=left>His throat tightened as he recalled the good times they had spent together, hurling good-natured insults at each other or simply keeping each other company in the busy markets of North Freeport.</p>

<p align=left>"Rest well, my friend. Rest in peace." was all he could manage.</p>

<p align=left>He stood still for a moment, then turned and trudged back up the dune the way he had come.</p>

<p align=left>Re-entering the cavern, he noted something odd. A small candle burned just inside the entrance.</p>

<p align=left>Shrugging, he bent to blow out the flame. No sense in wasting a perfectly good candle, he thought.</p>

<p align=left>The flame ignored his breath as if it were carved from solid stone.</p>

<p align=left>He blinked, and tried to pinch the wick between his fingers.</p>

<p align=left>The flame did not burn him. Neither did it extinguish.</p>

<p align=left>He bent once more and inhaled for another attempt...</p>

<p align=left>...and let out his breath in a shouted laugh.</p>

<p align=left>There on the floor of the cavern, dried leaves had piled in a seemingly random pattern. Only now they were random no more. Quite plainly, they spelled out...</p>

<p align=left>"Blow me, pig."</p>

<p align=left>Argil whirled around. "Solf, you old swine, where the hell are you?!?" he cried out.</p>

<p align=left>"Gooone" the wind seemed to whisper in response.</p>

<p align=left>His head dropped. Then he grinned in spite of himself. What better final message to receive then one guaranteed to put a smile on his face? The old swine was wiser than he knew.</p>

<p align=left>Still smiling, he turned to take final leave of his friend's memory...</p>

<p align=left>...and was thrown across the cavern by the force of the explosion.</p>

<p align=left>Stunned, he pulled himself up against the wall of the cavern and turned to look.</p>

<p align=left>...written in letters of fire, which hung in the air</p>

<p align=left>His jaw hung slack for a moment. Then he smiled again, then he laughed aloud, then he shouted, then he cheered like a madman, beating his hands on his thighs as the tears streamed down his face. This was the vision-message he had missed, all right. This was what his friend had been trying to tell him that night. Indeed, in harsh words given the lie by kind deeds, this was what Solf had been trying to teach him since the first day they had met.</p>

<p align=left>The flaming words writhed and spat and hissed and smoked like a living thing... and eventually faded and died out, also like a living thing.</p>

<p align=left>Their image, however, was burned into his memory forever…</p>

<p align=left>FRIENDSHIP TRANSCENDING WORLDS</p>

<p align=left>* * *</p>

<p align=left><i>In the cold empty cavern, a small candle burned. It neither consumed wax nor gave off heat, but it did give off something much more precious.</i></p>

<p align=left><i>Hope.</i></p>
