<p align=left><b>Enter the Priest</b><br><i>by Geist</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>"Rather strange," I thought. "He looks cold."</p>

<p align=left>I stood outside the church waiting on the high priest. On the steps, huddled against the large, oaken double doors, Pwyll played sentinel, arms folded tightly against himself. A strong, icy wind was blowing and in intervals swirling eddies of frost would gust up and spray over him. He pulled his hood over is head, glared for a moment at the gray sky, and went back to standing with his arms crossed even more tightly, his head bowed into his cowl. A howl, barely perceptible over the wind, emanated from the church. I looked up at the necromancer but he remained still.</p>

<p align=left>"The environment does not seem to agree with you," I said.</p>

<p align=left>Pwyll looked at me, scowled, and turned back into his robes. "Habit," he said.</p>

<p align=left>I watched him and hissed mirthfully to myself. Another spray of frost, this time from the roof, whipped down and blew into his robes and under his hood. He stomped and shook his fist and began to curse, but then checked himself. The howling had ceased. Through the church windows I could see lights.</p>

<p align=left>"Now you’ll get your audience."</p>

<p align=left>"That I shall," I said. </p>

<p align=left>Pwyll opened the left door and I entered. At the alter I knelt, said a brief prayer to Oblivion, and stood to await Bal-Anon Dak. He emerged from a back room, dressed all in black save for a dark blue apron. In his hand he held a vial. I nodded and made to speak, but he motioned that I remain silent. Behind me, at the far end of the room, I could hear Pwyll arranging some manuscripts. The high priest spoke.</p>

<p align=left>"Here is the means to your Akalabethian’s salvation."</p>

<p align=left>"Blood?" I said.</p>

<p align=left>"Blood, yes." Bal-Anon held the vial up against the soft light of a smoldering brazier. "Blood is the cause of his curse, and blood he seeks to satiate a hunger he does not understand. This blood" - he paused - "will rid him of the immortality he wishes to shed himself of. The blood of Oblivion." He handed the vial to me. I looked at him and trembled to take it.</p>

<p align=left>"Yes," he said. "The blood of Oblivion himself."</p>

<p align=left>"And this will cure him?" I said. "I had thought perhaps…"</p>

<p align=left>"It will cure him. But fear not. Oblivion’s blessing does not come easy. He feels pain, does he not?"</p>

<p align=left>"He has told me so, yes."</p>

<p align=left>Bal-Anon smiled. "And he will feel pain," he said. "Great pain, unending, until the blood finally consumes him…in time."</p>

<p align=left>"How long?"</p>

<p align=left>"Who can say. He has been alive now for centuries. A normal mortal - months, perhaps a year. One such as himself…well…we will see how badly he wants what he claims. If, and I repeat, if he can endure it, he will receive the death he seeks. However, the pain will be more, I think, than Mister Yarp has the fortitude to withstand. And then, when he is screaming and tearing at his flesh to make it stop, we have a cure for that too. And the price for that…" He laughed.</p>

<p align=left>I looked at the vile in my hand. Outside it had started to snow, and the wind was howling.</p>
