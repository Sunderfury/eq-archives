<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">... a few times since the changes. Everyone loves it because there is so much action. I mostly don't adventure in the dungeons on my own much these days but lead the S&M Monster Bashers once a week or more. Those rat men near the door aren't your vanilla variety rat men, and that's a fact. Not withstanding any special benefits to Bards, I think the Ice Dungeon is a great place to adventure. <p>Of course everyone looks for those staffs. We have never found one. Not sure what use they are anyway. Found on Ice snakes I hear? Some say they are on 1 in 50 snakes, others on 1 in 100 and so fourth. Do ye know, my friend, how prevalent those staffs are? At least the traffic has diminished since the red bone armor is now in vogue.<p>May th' virtues bless ye,<br>Tal<br></font>
