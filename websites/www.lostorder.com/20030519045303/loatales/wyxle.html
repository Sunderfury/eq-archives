<p align=left><b>Journal - Day One</b><br><i>by Wyxle</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Still can't believe it meself. Finally learned readin' and writin'. Had to happen someday though, makin' me rounds back and forth to Rivervale. The bloody sherriff thar kept readin' me my rights, so me learned a few things.</p>

<p align=left>Quite a reunion of sorts in Ak'anon today. Most of me brothers were thar, just a few missin' as usual. O'course the ones missin' are the ones who still owe me money. Seems Wyll has been havin' bad dreams or somethin'. Methinks it's a curse from the bloody wizards though! Can't trust 'em, never can. </p>

<p align=left>Me still don't know what this prophecy is that Wyll is talkin' bout. Me followed me brothers all the way to the bird altar, only to see the stranger Vojo pass out and brother Wyll fall into a trance. Methinks it was the curse or somethin', cause he was sayin' strange things and me no understand 'em. </p>

<p align=left>Somethin' about from the East and West winds, a new champion will rise and ride or somethin'. And somethin' will form from the the center of the Whirlwind. Me gets so confused with the big words. </p>

<p align=left>Oh well, at least me was able to borrow a few gold from the stranger Vojo and a couple of elves we passed along the way. They'll get by, I didn't take much this time. </p>

<p align=left>Maybe we'll learn more soon in the high elf city. If not, I'll just borrow some coins from that rich old innkeeper. Heck, I'll borrow his coins either way.</p>
