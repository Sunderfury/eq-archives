<p><b> Quest Report - Aerlinthe Island (take 1)</b></p>

<p>Last night was one of the longest most frustrating AC sessions I've had in a while.  If ever I lead this quest again it will be with a much smaller tighter team.  We had a great group of people with us (Khalil, myself and a group from the ACRevolution boards<a href="http://www.acrevolution.com/cgi-bin/YaBB/YaBB.pl?board=Morningthaw" target="_blank">ACRevolution boards</a>) but at around 15 people it really proved to be 1. too much for my computer to handle (need upgrade) and 2. too much for my lame leadership skills to handle.<br />
<br />
Anyway around 7 I was starting a large pot of home made pasta sause and getting logged into AC so I could get a sluce gate bar from the Teakarrdun Foundry.  Dara Eunomia and Luna Sedai both assisted in that effort and we managed to get to the foundry, get the sluice gate bar and get out all before 8.<br />
<br />
About 8:30ish the group had finally assembled and we buffed up and began the run around the island to the Aerlinthe Reservoir.  The run there was uneventful, but the run into the dungeon was fatal for many.  There were so many monsters and partical effects that several computer (mine included) froze while the monsters hammered us to death.  We did manage to recover our bodies and get into the Reservoir, and proceed to get lost.  We didn't stay lost forever though, as Luna and others eventually found the way down to the othoi section.  From there it was a pretty strait shot to get to the repair golem and start the quest off with the sluice gate bar.<br />
<br />
From the reservoir we proceeded to the foundry, I died again on the way and had to recover.  Eventually I did get to the foundry and we proceeded to get lost again trying to get to the smith golem.  Towards the end Eladia, Khalil and myself became separated from the rest of the group.  I managed to get the bellows turned in as Eladia recalled and Khalil died.  I died shortly there after trying to recover Khalil's things.<br />
<br />
At this point I had to call it a night, but from what I hear the rest of the group bested both the Behemoth, Lady Aerfelle, and grief quest jumper Stay Puff all before the night was through.<br />
<br />
Perhaps in a couple weeks I'll try this again because I still want my Aerlinthe recall scroll, robe, stave and what not.  However next time I do go it will be with a smaller more managable team and fortunatly a good bit more experiance leading the quest.<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >__________________<br>

<p><b> Sometimes you're the windshield . . .</b></p>

<p>. . . and sometimes you're the bug.<br />
<br />
This was my evening to be the bug; the house lost power at about 18:30  EST, finally restored around 23:00.  I went to bed early, and it looks like I missed all of the excitement.  Count me in for next time.<br />
<br />
'Grats, BTW, on your 'win' over Stay puff. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I suggest that we finish the Quiddity thingy quest; I've still got my Martinate whatsis key, and I'm not sure where we go from here.<br />

<p>Well with the key all we need to do is raid the final dungeon in the south dirlands.  Its not TOO far from the Mayoi to South Direlands portal drop.  We can run that one on sunday or next thursday if you want <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
and I think it'll be a bit before i try to lead another Aerlinthe run.  I need to restock on di's after leaving a few bodies out there<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >__________________<br>

<p>Luckily all I lost were portal gems and a pricey crown.  No biggie I suppose.<br />
<br />
As for that run to the Reservoir, that was anything but uneventful for me.  I didn't think to go along the shore line which is the way I believe you guys went.  I ran around the inside of the bay....oh my god, was that scary.  I didn't pick up a sing key on the way though.<br />
<br />
I don't know why that Plasma Golem one hitted me.  I had my protects up and armor was baned except for lightning of course.  I didn't think they hit that hard.</p>
