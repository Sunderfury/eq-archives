<p align=left><b>Come The Watchmen, Part II</b><br><i>by GrimJack</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>With breakfast and Vizier’s attempts to get extra food by “helping” in the kitchen behind them, the left the inn and attempted to put Rithwic behind them. It was going to be a long walk back to Cragstone with nothing but a buried corpse and a piece of gold with no markings; Tasslehoff would not be happy. As they rounded the corner of the building, Grimjack caught a flash of movement out of one corner of his eye. Before he could yell a warning to the other two, a sharp pain started in his left temple that sent him to the ground. Over him stood the stranger from breakfast, wielding his magic wand like a club.</p>

<p align=left>“Talk! What did you do to my brother!”</p>

<p align=left>Grimjack, not wanting to tangle with a mage so soon after eating (Its commonly known that fighting mages after a meal means the non-mage always loses) laid on the ground, pretending to be knocked unconscious. This looked like a job for Vizier.</p>

<p align=left>“Whoa friend” Vizier yelled. “No need to get all upset at us, we just found him is all!”</p>

<p align=left>“I am sure you found him when he was alive and killed him!”</p>

<p align=left>The stranger lowered his wand at Vizier, said two words and shot a bolt of lightning at Vizier, knocking him down. While not really hurt, Vizier was also aware that it was never good to tangle with mages after a meal and lay silent.</p>

<p align=left>“Ok, you are the last one alive now tell me why you killed my brother!” The stranger was about to lay waste to Cyvreaux with another blast of strange magic.</p>

<p align=left>“Awww stop that. Vizier here was tellin’ th’ truth. We jes' found him, honest.” Cyvreaux punctuated the ‘here’ with a sharp kick to Vizier’s ribs. Vizier managed to stifle any sort of whimper or retort.</p>

<p align=left>“I don’t believe you.”</p>

<p align=left>“My name is Cyvreaux, wots yers?”</p>

<p align=left>“Dalmar. Now, where is Zimmer?”</p>

<p align=left>“Follow me, I know jes where he is” said Cyvreaux as he led the stranger away toward the buried body. A few minutes later, Grimjack rolled up on one elbow and looked at Vizier who was now openly wincing.</p>

<p align=left>“I thought you were better at this diplomacy than I am?”</p>

<p align=left>Between strained breaths Vizier managed to squeak out “I...am…going…to…kill…both…of…you…”</p>

<p align=left>“Later, we need to follow them before Cyvreaux decides to loot Dalmar.”</p>

<p align=left>Following the stranger and Cyvreaux, the pair of childhood friends trailed at a safe distance as they went toward the buried body.</p>

<p align=left>An hour or so later, Dalmar and Cyvreaux reached the rock cairn that marked the grave of Zimmer.</p>

<p align=left>“Here ‘tis.”</p>

<p align=left>Dalmar leaned down and mumbled something quietly that Cyvreaux could not hear. Cyvreaux took the opportunity to examine his new companion. Dalmar was taller than Cyvreaux by a couple of inches, clean shaven with red hair. His outfit favored toward greens and browns: a studded coat and boots, bracers made of some sort of animal hide. He looked every bit a delicate mage with his thin build and short-cropped hair. Cyvreaux was sure he could fetch 100 pyreals for the wand if he could get one.</p>

<p align=left>“I see prints of boots all over the place. They don’t seem to match your shoes, nor those of your friends.”</p>

<p align=left>“Boots? Where?”</p>

<p align=left>“Prints are here.” Dalmar took three steps east. “Here.” Four steps south “here. They are rather large marks, too small for a lugian but just about right for a monouga, I think.”</p>

<p align=left>“See, I told ya so. We did nothing.” Cyvreaux’s mind began to wonder what he could get for the reagents that the mage was carrying. “Got any brimstone?”</p>

<p align=left>“I am all out. What did you need it for?”</p>

<p align=left>“Oh nothing.” Cyvreaux’s grin was as wide as the horizon.</p>

<p align=left>Dalmar stopped looking at the tracks in the ground and stood up “You can come over here now.” Cyvreaux wasn’t sure who was talking to at first until Grimjack and Vizier stepped between two tall reed bushes.</p>

<p align=left>“How did you know?” Vizier stammered. This was a blow to his weeks of ranger training; to be found out by a mage was unthinkable.</p>

<p align=left>“Magic.”</p>

<p align=left>“Dalmar, it seems yer brother was on a mission for our monarch, Tasslehoff Windrunner. Would you care to accompany us to his...umm…office?” Grimjack had had plenty of time to settle his food, so any more blows to the head would lead to a real scrum; but he felt he owed it to Dalmar to get to the root of his brother’s death.</p>

<p align=left>“I will go.”</p>

<p align=left>They set off to Cragstone, sunlight penetrating the treetops and lighting the path along the way.</p>
