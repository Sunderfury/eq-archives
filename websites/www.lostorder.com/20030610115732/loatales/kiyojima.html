<p align=left><b>The Call Is Answered</b><br><i>by Kiyo-Jima</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Rounding the corner of the Cragstone Library, Kiyo stopped dead in his tracks, stunned. The sense of dread that had been growing in him for the past few days evaporated in that instant. As his eyes took in the scene before him, pride in his brethren and the glory of the Lost Order of Akalabeth swelled within him.</p>

<p align=left>For before him was not some few of the Order, as one might have reasonably expected to answer such a call for aid, but a host such that those passing by cast wary glances and hurried on. They had come from cities all across Dereth in answer to his call, braving the dangers of the roads and the evil that roamed them. Priests, sailors, squires, and mages, stood shoulder to shoulder, companionably trading barbed jests and bold stories. A stranger would be hard pressed to understand why such a diverse group would gather, if they did not understand the Order. For each might be as different from the other as night is to day, but each held Honor and Valor close to their hearts and stood ready to live or die for one another and the Lost Order of Akalabeth.</p>

<p align=left>The Call to Arms had been made and the Order had answered in the only way it knew how, as one.</p>

<p align=left>Kiyo approached the group, bowing to those assembled and calling a pray that the Gods might watch over them all. Quick greetings were exchanged, a last flagon, or two, was hoisted by the sailors, prayers were mumbles, spells prepared and they were ready.</p>

<p align=left>From his pack, Kiyo took the offering he had prepared and laid it on the ground whispering quietly to the Wind and reaching within to touch the Earth. The portal opened and the Order marched through the opening, to appear moments later in the Ancient City. As the last appeared, they reformed the group and made their way through the crumbling streets of the city until Kiyo pointed out another portal, just visible in the midst of a collapsed building. Someone swore and muttered a curse about mages, portals, and magic in general. Some laughed at the statement while others muttered agreement, but none hesitated in stepping forward and through the portal.</p>

<p align=left>The Wind whispered through the High Mountain Valley as the host again appeared, this time among a smaller but just as ruined settlement. Guiding them to a building that stood a little separate from the others, Kiyo drew his blade and donned his helmet, motioning for the others to do likewise. As one, they descended into the Lost Garden.</p>

<p align=left>An overgrown lizard of some sort greeted them at the entrance and Katana Moonblade, Guilbert de Valis and Baltazir rushed the creature, giving the others time to clear the passage and settle on a strategy. The battle raged on as Kiyo explained to Kelsam and Karas-Zan what they were most likely to find within and together they came up with a tentative plan of action.</p>

<p align=left>It was decided that they would clear the upper two levels of the skeletal warriors and archers they were likely to find, as one force. Once this was accomplished, they would split into two forces. Valdox, Kazap and Kiyo would descend to the lower depths to search for the link to the boy and to try to clear the place of Shadows. Kelsam would hold the upper levels with Karas-Zan, Guilbert de Valis, Baltazir, Enosh, and Katana from the skeletons that were surely going to reanimate until the source of the magic binding them was found and destroyed. Kelsam would use the Garden as his base so the others would know where to find him and it was hoped that by having the second force hold the upper levels, the first force would have a clear exit should something unforeseen occur.</p>

<p align=left>The battle for the upper levels, while grisly, went well enough and soon the Order was in control of those levels. Karas-Zan took a small wound that was quickly healed by the healing properties of the fountain in the Garden. Odd that such a fountain and an apple orchard should flourish with life among a host of undead. </p>

<p align=left>Valdox, Kazap and Kiyo watched Kelsam's force, while readying themselves for the descent, and were impressed with the skill and discipline they showed. As the skeletons reanimated, the warriors would charge it even as the mages flung spells either to heal their companions or to attack the foul creatures. Though Kiyo found the sound of the battle was quite disconcerting with the sailors singing chantey's, the mages invoking spells, and the priests murmuring prayers while throughout it all there was the steady crunch of bone.</p>

<p align=left>Satisfied, that the upper levels would remain clear, they descended. Kiyo found the course of events to be much different with Valdox and Kazap along then his solo effort had been. Kazap's magic coupled with Valdox's strength proved to be devastating to the Shadows that attacked at each turn. In this manner, they proceed through the passages, exploring the various rooms they encountered, a fountain in one, a huge throne in another, debris in a third.</p>

<p align=left>Finally, they entered a room that had a stone pedestal or marker jutting from the floor. The pedestal was cylindrical in shape with a slanting green top that glowed faintly. Upon entering the room Kiyo was sure that this was the source of the link with the boy. Placing both hands on the pedestal, Kiyo felt pure energy surging through the pedestal, clearly the source of the Garden's energy. Frowning, Kiyo reached deeper into the stone and deep within it found where it had been warped by foul magics. The sense of evil was sickening and only his discipline kept him from tearing his hands away from the pedestal. Murmuring, he called on Fire to purify the pedestal. Moments later he rose to his feet, satisfied. </p>

<p align=left>Glancing at Valdox and Kazap, standing guard on either side of the entrance, he nodded wearily.</p>

<p align=left>Valdox reached for a flask and asked, "We done mate? The boy is safe?"</p>

<p align=left>"Aye my friend, for the moment at any rate. Lets return to the others and get out of this place. I must hurry to the town of Karas and gather up the boy. I will not feel comfortable till he is behind the walls of the Dedicates Keep."</p>

<p align=left>The three turned back down the corridor, heading for the Garden and their companions.</p>
