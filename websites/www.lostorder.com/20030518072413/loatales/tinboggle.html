<p align=left><b>Tinboggle's Diary</b><br><i>by Tinboggle</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I do not like to write. It is a nuisance, to have to sit here and scribble words upon a parchment. A necessary nuisance though, for I am drawing a map. Normally, a map is meant to benefit others, to describe for them the features of an unknown region. But this map is different; it is a map for myself alone, to be used in case I get lost again. It is my hope that, by following these hastily scrawled lines of black ink, I will be able to find my way back to myself, to remember who I am.</p>

<p align=left>My name is Tinboggle – or at least, I think it is. I had another name once, but it is gone from my memory now, along with so many other things.</p>

<p align=left>I believe it was the thunder that woke me up. I found myself lying in a grassy meadow, staring at leaden skies above, feeling their cold tears upon my brow. As I sat up, I looked around and saw no one. Only the hills and nearby mountains that I remembered and yet did not remember. Who was I? What was I doing here?</p>

<p align=left>It would have been easy for me to believe that I had just been born, that I had not lived until now. But I knew that to be a falsehood. I could remember things from before, things that I had done. But those things seemed somehow distant now; it was as though I had just awakened from a dream – a dream that was quickly fading from memory. And try as I might, I could not bring it back.</p>

<p align=left>So I got up and made my way toward a nearby collection of ruined pillars. Wet, cold and miserable, and I felt completely lost and alone. I huddled and shivered beneath those cold stone columns, desperately struggling to remember something…anything.</p>

<p align=left>And then I saw a number of gnomes doing battle on a nearby plateau. They were besieged on all sides by a swarm of angry spiders, and it seemed to me that they would surely perish. Something had to be done!</p>

<p align=left>It was then that arcane symbols appeared in my mind. I instinctively knew the words of power that would call forth bolts of fire from my fingertips, and I shouted them aloud to the looming clouds above. And when the fire was gone, I leapt forward with my pitiful rusted knife and tried my best to skewer one of the deadly arachnids.</p>

<p align=left>I needn’t have bothered. The others were quite capable, and within minutes the field was strewn with eight-legged corpses. The battle was over, and within seconds there were bottles of mead and ale being passed around. A beautiful young woman approached and offered a flask to me, but I hastily declined. The last thing I needed was to cloud my mind more than it already was!</p>

<p align=left>A young fellow, whom I later identified as Bistani, noticed that I was out of sorts. When he asked what was wrong, I said nothing; I could not bring myself to tell him of my plight. But during the battle, I saw that one of the spiders had been mechanical in nature, and the sight of it had awakened a memory in me. I could not say why, nor how – but I knew that these spiders had been fashioned for an ill purpose. They were designed to roam the entire region, programmed to gather information and collect…what? What was it that they were trying to collect?</p>

<p align=left>A swordsman named Wyrfil pried open one of the robotic carcass and found some curious fragments within. He brought the fragments to my attention, and I secured them within a pouch for later investigation.</p>

<p align=left>By this time I was absolutely exhausted, and wanted only to sleep. Perhaps I would somehow regain part of my missing pieces through rest. I remembered the way to Ak’Anon, and I followed the old path with a heavy heart, my mind full of dark and foreboding thoughts. For though I could not remember the past, I was fairly certain that some sort of terrible danger was yet lurking in the future, lying patiently in wait like an invisible spider.</p>
