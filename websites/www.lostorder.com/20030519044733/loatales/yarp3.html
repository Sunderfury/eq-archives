<p align=left><b>The Last Stand of Yarp The Ever</b><br><i>by Yarp the Ever</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Yarp the Ever stood in the shadows, his torn and bloodied cloak whipping about his shoulders in the cold wind. Though his face was shrouded, the faintest hint of a smile crossed his lips as he waited. Materializing out of nowhere, Geist floated towards him. Two months ago, this would have unnerved Yarp, though he had never let it show. Geist approached Yarp, and Yarp stepped up to him, as if to challenge him, face to face.</p>
<p align=left>“Ghost, if you came here to play games, I will have none of it. If you fail to deliver this time, I will not rest until your corpus is scattered across the heavens” Yarp said, a slight tremor audible in his voice.</p>
<p align=left>Geist did not back down, instead, smiling, produced a small vial from his cloak. Holding it in his translucent hands, he caressed it softly. The vial was blacker than the night, and indeed, as Geist was holding it, it seemed like a hole in the night. Geist did not seem to want to hand it over, but as he reluctantly placed it in Yarp’s eagerly outstretched hand, he spoke, more softly than he ever had before…</p>
<p align=left>“Yarp, understand what I am giving you here. Though it is not important how we got it, you hold the blood of Oblivion himself…” his voice trailed off.</p>
<p align=left>Yarp smiled, partially in disbelief, partially with excitement. “If this is what the ghost says, this should do it. No one could survive ingesting Oblivion himself…not even the undead…or the Ever.” He looked at the liquid</p>
<p align=left>Yarp looked up to see Geist watching him closely. Yarp tucked the potion into his cloak, but as he did so, the vial hanging delicately around his neck clinked against the bottle of blackness. The sound resonated through the forest, silencing the already quiet air. The space that the lack of sound left was eerie. Yarp chuckled to himself as he raised his eyes up to look at the spectre in front of him.</p>
<p align=left>“Truth be told, Lightbringer, I do not think you have the courage to do this. How does it feel, after millennia of failure, to hold success in your warm hands?” Geist spoke deliberately.</p> 
<p align=left>“I do not believe it. I do not believe you. I know you better than you think, Geist. And I know that there is treachery here somewhere. What is the catch?” Yarp asked.</p>
<p align=left>Geist’s expression didn’t change as he answered. “You asked for death, for release from life. You hold the answer.” Geist continued, looking away oddly. “Yarp, this once I will not lie to you. You will most certainly die, there cannot be any question of that. But there will most certainly be consequences. After all, there is always a price to pay, is there not?” Geist turned to look at Yarp directly in the eyes, his expression cold. “You have what you want. The only question at this point is how badly you want it. You have maintained all this time that nothing binds you to your immortality, that you gladly give up all you are, all you have to “rest”, to die. What you hold did not come easily, Lightbringer. Will you waste it? How badly do you want this?” Geist spoke the last sentence pointedly.</p>
<p align=left>“Kal Ort Por….We will meet again…” were the last words that Geist heard as Yarp disappeared.</p>

<p align=left>Geist disappeared with a triumphant smile as the full moon poked out from behind the clouds, and a lone wolf bayed in the distance….</p>
