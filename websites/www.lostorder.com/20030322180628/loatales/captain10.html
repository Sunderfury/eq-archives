<p align=left>Captain's Log: Morningthaw 9</p>

<p align=left>You know I'm startin' to wonder about this place.  You'd figure that most
places, when spring arives and the new year starts, the weather starts
getting warmer.  Today when I awoke it was probably the coldest day yet
since I found myself walking the forests of Dereth.  Still I've got more
imediate concers, like how I'm going to pay me tab here at the Royal Firkin.</p>

<p align=left>To that end I figure I'll take a stab at the rumored Rithwic crypts.  That
is if I can manage to find them.  I'd do just about anything fer a few
pyreal at this point (anything that is except werk fer Ricetha cleanin' mugs
and washin' tables)</p>

<p align=left>(later in the day)</p>

<p align=left>Well I didn't find those cypts though I did find meself back in Lytelthotpe
again.  I searched all over the west bank of the river north of town and
didn't find a bloody thing but trouble.  First I happened across a camp of
drudges and moswarts. That wasn't a problem fer me and I layed them all out
in a line.  Next it was that red phyntos wasps.  Again not much of  a
problem.</p>

<p align=left>Once I dispatched the red wasps, I set about tryin' to pry their wings off
with out damage.  I know of a collector in Lytelthorpe that was lookin' fer
a set of wings to add to her collection.  Well wouldn't you know it that as
soon as I got one good pair of wings off that wasp that a squadrin of blue
wasps snuck up behind me.  I didn't know they were there until I felt the
air around me explode in a fire ball.  Now I want to know what god's sick
sence of humor gave the blue wasps the fire magic in the first place.  The
bloody wasp nearly roasted me alive before I knew what I was doing.  Well I
did what any harded adventure would do when roasted to within an inch of his
life.</p>

<p align=left>I ran.</p>

<p align=left>Some how I managed to run far enough and fast enough that the blue wasps got
bored and gave up tryin' to turn me into "salty sailor shishkabob".
Needless to say, when I made it back to Rithwic propor I needed a drink!  I
walked into the Royal Firkin just in time to see Ricetha talkin' to a couple
of rough lookin' mercinaries.  She pointed one finger at me and said "That's
the pirate!"  Once again I did what any hardened adventure would do in such
a situation.</p>

<p align=left>I ran, again.</p>

<p align=left>This time though I through a small pouch of pyreal and smacked good ole
Ricetha right in the forhead before I high tailed it out of there.  Those
mercs were persistant to say the least.  I managed to beat them to the
Lytelthorpe portal by no more than 3 steps.  This was of course right before
I remeber why I left Lytelthorpe to begin with.  I really need to stop
"makin' a name fer meself" in some of these towns, afore I have no place to
go get me ale anymore.</p>

<p align=left>Still I was lucky when I made my way into Lytelthorpe, seems all by
Selflora's forgotten me already.  That and the ax wieldin' brute of a
husband was gone travelin' again too.  So fer the time bein' I settled down,
ordered meself a good stout and watched the rain fall fer a while.  Mayhaps
tomorrow I'll head out again fer some more trouble makein', er I mean
adventuring.</p>
