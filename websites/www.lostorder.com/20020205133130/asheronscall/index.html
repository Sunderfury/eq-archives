				<h3>This week's quest schedule</h3>
The schedule for this week can be found <a href="http://www.lostorder.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1560">in this post</a> on the forums.  Please note that we're going to need a reasonable group for sunday, as it'll be the "get your mule a focusing stone" sunday.  Let me know if you plan on attending.  Also if possible the more people that run through the Three Tower's quest before hand, the more mules we can get focusing stones.  Three Towers can be easily handled alone by anyone over level 40 or so, but if you need/want a hand let me know in game.<p>

That's right, according to Computer Games Online Asheron's Call 2 is scheduled for a December 31, 2002 ship date.  Take a look at the artical here:<a href="http://www.cgonline.com/releasedates/rd_12_2002.html">http://www.cgonline.com/releasedates/rd_12_2002.html</a>  I hope my little laptop can handle it when it ships *grins*<p>

				<h3>Reminder: Helm and Shield of the Simulacra quest tonight at 9PM EST</h3>
Quick reminder that tonight at 9 we'll be meeting at my house in Rithwic (Meridian settlement actually) and prepairing to raid the northern and souther infiltrators keeps.  Bring you're level 25-40 characters and an appitite to kill virindi!  <p>
To get to my house, follow the road south east out of Rithwic (towards Dryreach)  A short distance past the ruins of the old outpost is a group of settlement portals.  Take the meridian settlement portal and you'll practically be on my doorsteep.<p>

Both the build notes and rollout artical are availble already as well. Find them at these links:<p>

Also word has it that there's some foul business about at old fort Whitshire that many of us old timers remebers fondly from days past.  I'll be investigating at first chance.
<p>
<b>Update!</b> There are queer happenings at Whitshire indeed, seek out Elyssa's guard in Shoushi for information.  I will do so myself when I get home from work tonight.  I did explore the fort itself and found it infested with hollow minions.  Also the entrance to the fort is blockaged, though I managed to jump the wall with the help of a mattekar.  There's a trap door in the house in the center of the fort, this leads to a dungeon full of hollow minions and simulacra.  I will need to investigate further.<p>

				<h3>Slight schedule change...</h3>
Slight change to the schedule for this week:  Thursday night at 9PM EST we will go after the helm and shield of the Simulacra instead of the Atlan major sparking stone.  This will give our lower level member (and non-members in the allegiance tree) a chance to join up for a bit of an adventure.  The following sunday we will take our higher level characters on a raid of the Asteliary for the orb and the gem of the asteliary to imbue either the sheild or helm from the week before.<p>

Hope to see you all there!<p>

				<h3>January Event Teaser Posted!</h3>
All can say is it looks like we're in for a wild ride, an undead isparin geomancer, whom is responcible for building our homes, clearly insane with fear of the yalin, a human with a virindi symbiot, responcible for singularity weapons and other chaos, clearly mad with hatred of Asheron, and a radical disturbance to the forces of magic in the realm.
