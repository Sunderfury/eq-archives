<p align=left><b>Journey's End</b><br><i>by Aanlain Treeskin</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Fighting to struggle up from the fog that was a tremendous hangover, Aanlain sat up from his ill prepared bedroll. “Ooh that was a mistake” he whispered as he laid back down.</p>

<p align=left>Cracking an eye he examined his surroundings. He was in an abandoned temple in Everfrost. Bottles, glasses, and half eaten pieces of meat were strewn about, the evidence of the celebration from the night before. Other revelers began to wake, and without the benefit of alcohol, began to realize just how cold Everfrost was.</p>

<p align=left>“Well Waran’s been hitched boyo so get yer arse outta bed and help me get some food going afore the rest of this ragtag lot wakes up!” said Dargo. “Do you have to yell, My niece’s concoction has some sort of magical properties, I doona remember much after the ceremony last night, and I seem to have two trolls wrestling in me belly, and an ogre drum corps in me noggin” whispered Aanlain.</p>

<p align=left>Dargo reared back and kicked Aanlain in the shin. “Eeeyow!” said Aanlain as he jumped up reaching for his scimitar. “Hold there Aan…. Afore you think o loppin me head off how’s yer head?” he asked.</p>

<p align=left>“Why me headache’s gone and me belly has stopped floppin… Amazing!” he exclaimed. “Nahh tis simple dwarven drinkin skills, ye Elves have no ken o’ drinkin…. You should have known that afore you downed 12 bottles of Cyrssi’s vodka.” Scolded the dwarf.</p>

<p align=left>The pair spent the morning cleaning up the mess from the wedding and resulting party, feeding those that could eat, and kicking those that couldn’t. When everyone was up and about Aanlain went to collect his personal effects. He hefted his pack and looked around for his Paladin friend. He found Dargo sitting at the edge of the temple steps staring at the horizon, head in his hands.</p>

<p align=left>“What troubles ye friend?” asked Aanlain. “I’m tired is all, these bones have grown weary and every day seems like the next Aan.. I have defeated the Shin Lord, I have traveled these lands with the Order, and it’s been ages since I have slept in me own bed” Lamented Dargo.</p>

<p align=left>“Bah! I know just what ye need.. grab yer things and let’s be off” said Aanlain. The pair gathered their belongings and walked away from the wedding site towards the entrance to Permafrost Keep.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain could see the pain in his friend’s eyes as they walked, the lines in his face he never noticed before and the hair that was once jet black had lost it’s luster and begun to gray at the temples.</p>

<p align=left>They crept through the entrance tunnels of Permafrost sliding past the sentries, and making their way to the preacher’s chambers, searching for the magic circlet that so many of their bretheren seemed to want.</p>

<p align=left>They battled for hours as the hordes of ice goblins seemed endless. At last the preacher deigned to show his face and The two jumped from their rest and attacked him as one. A ferocious battle it was, the preacher healing himself with every blow landed on him. Aanlain summoned the last of his power and rained fire upon the ice goblin. “My strength is gone!” he shouted. With a final blow from the Observer’s staff the preacher fell.</p>

<p align=left>A crushing silence fell upon his ears, he had not heard a sound from Dargo since his battle cries a few moments before. Dargo was sitting against the wall with a smile on his face. Aanlain walked to his friends side to see what was so funny. As he drew closer he noticed the broken shaft of a spear protruding from Dargo’s abdomen. Aanlain rushed to his friend’s side. “Be strong friend, give me moment to rest and I shall heal you!” Aanlain fell into a trance and began to pray to Tunare for the strength he needed to heal his friend.</p>

<p align=left>His meditation was disturbed as he felt a cold hand upon his. “Do not do this Aan” he heard Dargo whisper. Aanlain opened his eyes and looked upon his long time friend. “I must Dargo, I cannot see you die!” Aanlain said in an anguished whisper. “I told you my boy, I am tired, these bones ache, and my heart no longer burns with the same fire it used to” whispered the fallen paladin. Dargo took Aanlain’s hand and gave it a strong grip “I go home now boy, let me travel in peace.” Dargo coughed once, closed his eyes and leaned back against the cold stone.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain gave a silent plea to Tunare and summoning every last bit of energy he could, he pulled the spear shaft from his friend and cast his strongest healing spell. The soft nimbus of blue light surrounded Dargo and Aanlain smiled as he watched the wounds close. But still his friend did not stir. Aanlain reached for his friend’s hand and found it cold, with no sign of the life pulse.</p>

<p align=left>“Your healing well not help this one child of Tunare” a deep voice said from behind Aanlain. He jumped and there before him stood the image of Brell himself. “Why does it end this way!?” Aanlain asked. “Who said this is the end?” said a voice from behind him. Aanlain whirled but saw nothing. “I go to rest for now my friend. Gather my things and distribute them among the Order” said the shade.</p>

<p align=left>“Don’t Go! You are needed ye ignorant dwarf!” exclaimed the druid. But his screams only echoed off the cold walls of the keep, and once more Aanlain was alone. He sat crying softly, remembering the adventures that they had together, and the foes they had defeated.</p>

<p align=left>He was roused from his lament by the scrape of armor against stone in the hallways near the chamber. Aanlain cast a strength spell on himself and hefted the body of his fallen friend. He steadied himself, then recalled himself to Kaladim. Once there, he found a suitable place in the keep, and there placed Dargo’s body on a pedestal and covered it with a clean cloth.
He looked down on the body, wiped the tears from his eyes and spoke. “You will be missed my friend. I hope that wherever you are, that you are happy and that your heart burns once again with the fire that I have known” Aanlain said.</p>

<p align=left>The druid turned from the room and walked out of the keep and into the forests of Faydwer.</p>
