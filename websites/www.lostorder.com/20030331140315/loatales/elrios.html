<p align=left><b>One Fine Day</b><br><i>by Elrios</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>One rainy afternoon in the Brewman's, Elrios and Broog were discussing upon varios subjects.</p>
<p align=left>"Ye need to get outta that thar' Ironwerks and enjoy the finer things of life!" exclaimed Elrios.</p>
<p align=left>"If you mean finding prostetutes and drinking day in and day out, it's not for me." said Broog calmly.</p>
<p align=left>"Ho ho! What ye really need is to find that..." A crashing through the doorway interrupted the sentance. A man staggers through the room "...please... tell me where I am..." the man asks.</p>
<p align=left>"Your in the Brewman's Tavern, owned by the Lost Order." said Broog.</p>
<p align=left>After drying the man and placing him on the stool next to Broog, Elrios made his way around to behind the bar and gloats "This 'eres where I'll be settin' up shop! By the way, whar'd ye come from and why'd ye pick such a nasty day fer a walk?!</p>
<p align=left>"I didn't pick the day, I've been walking fer about a month searching for a place called the Lost Order of Akalabeth, in the Yew forset. I come from Buccaneer's den." said the man solomnley replied.</p>
<p align=left>"Why are you looking for the Lost Order? I like I said when you came in this is the Lost Order's tavern." said Broog.</p>
<p align=left>"I'm looking fer a man named Elrios, do ye know him?" replied the man.</p>
<p align=left>"I'm Elrios, why are ye lookin fer me?" asked Elrios pouring himself some liquer.</p>
<p align=left>"My mother told me I could find ye here. By the way, I never mentioned my name..."</p>
<p align=left>At that sentence, Broog snaps to atention.</p>
<p align=left>"It's Elrios III" replies the man.</p>
<p align=left>"What the...?"</p>
<p align=left>"How can ye?!" exclaim the two bewildered men.</p>
<p align=left>"My mother told me I could find you here!! I've waited my entire life to meet you!! Mother says you're the nicest man she ever met! Although she describes you more elegantly..."</p>
<p align=left>"Broog, can I see ye in the back room?" says a bewildered Elrios.</p>
<p align=left>"Sure, I need to ask you a few things anyway."</p>
<p align=left>The two men make their way into the back of the Brewman's.</p>
<p align=left>"WHO IS THIS 'ERE FELLA!?" hollers Elrios.</p>
<p align=left>"I was just about to ask you same, Elrios. Were you ever in Buccaneer's den on your... ahem 'buisness' trips?" asked Broog.</p>
<p align=left>"I might 'ave... why?"</p>
<p align=left>"You think you might have had a little 'fun' while you were there?"</p>
<p align=left>"Per'aps I mighta'."</p>
<p align=left>"There you go."</p>
<p align=left>"Arrr!!!!"</p>
<p align=left>The two men return to Elrios III.</p>
<p align=left>"I'm completely self-sufficient, father, you don't need to help me with anything. It's just great knowing yer alive!" explains Elrios III.</p>
<p align=left>"So I needent to do anythin' fer ye?" mutters Elrios.</p>
<p align=left>"Nay, I was going to ask the guild head if I could work in the ironworks on the guild, I'm training to the art of blacksmithy." said Elrios III.</p>
<p align=left>"Ye need to talk to Broog 'bout that." says Elrios.</p>
<p align=left>"We'll see what we can do for you, Elrios III. We could always use another smith." says Broog reassuringly.</p>
<p align=left>"Thank you so much!!!" says Elrios III excitedly.</p>
