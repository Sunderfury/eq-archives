<p align=left><b>Escape</b><br><i>by Vailen</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Infinite darkness.....complete void.....thus was the plane of the Nothing. Peering around, a lone figure waited. Waited, such small word. Waiting consisted of knowing that an outcome would occur at some time or another. But what this figure waited for could not nor would not ever happen. The voices of destruction sang their song in his mind, praising themselves for their infinite victories. One such victory stuck out among the rest. Twas their final victory over him, one that took several lifetimes to achieve. Clenching his fists, the being sighed as the choir began again. Madness it was, bloody madness he thought. Why had he chosen the one plane shattered by magic, spread out like many shards of glass. Sometimes, he resented choosing that plane of escape. He could have never been forced to admit defeat had he not chosen the lands of Britainia. Shaking his head, the man started walking....if that is what it could be called. No. He didn't regret going there, he had found something no other place could have. Love. How could he honor that word, it had caused his defeat. These beings destroyed everything his race ever built. Well, except for one. He was the only one that lived, his driving force for dragging the battle across the planes in hope of striking back at the Nothing. That hadn't destroyed him....they relished the thought of imprisoning the last one of the only race that ever stood a chance against them. "Bargainer?" the voices inquired. "Yes, what do you want?" the man replied somberly. "Ah...just wondering where you were.....we added a new plane to our vast domain this eve," the voices continued. The mans head shook in disgust. "No, it was not where your beloved exists.....we are forced to uphold your deal you know....till her death." Anger struck his soul, he knew they knew the one loophole in his bargain. "What will satisfy you?" he asked in an angry tone. "How many worlds must be lost to satiate your hunger?" The plane grew silent, as though they all began to think at once. A figure appeared in front of the man, its shape never holding one form too long. A face appeared and spoke "All of them....we want them ALL!" The figure vanished as another appeared next to where it had arrived. "What? Did you think we would stop our conquests because we had you?" the new figure inquired. "Begone!" the man shouted as he turned and walked away. The voices began again, singing praise to themselves. A choir of destruction. A choir of pain. Millenniums of tormenters and torturers and destroyers of beings. A new voice spoke, one not heard in some time. It seemed to echo the vast plane of emptiness. "Vailen....I miss you...."</p>

<p align=left>Damnit! Her voice, the one anchor he had from time to time. Only when she slept. Such pain was this, could drive a man insane. Was he? But to be insane, a person must be judged against a standard set by a society. They was no society here, just him. Where had she been when he managed to escape that one time. He had walked amongst their home waiting patiently, but she never came. When he went to the village of their family, even then there was no-one. He had thought he was dreaming till someone recognized him at the Skara Brae bank. An old friend. They had talked of things past and of things to come for his mortal friend. It had been a huge relief to know he was actually in Britainia. Then they came....and tore through the plans....dragging him back to the void. It had taken some length of time to regain his strength after it, how much was uncertain. Time meant nothing here. Escape. Elude them again, he thought. But to where? "Pathetic wretches! Come behold thy destruction!" he yelled out for all and nothing to hear. They came. The beings formed about him, they eyes filled with hate and anger. "You are DEFEATED!" the seemed to scream in his mind. "We have you!" The mans eyes closed and focused. Surprise. Caught off guard. The creatures reeled back in torment. "How dare you!" they sang in chaotic voices. Vailen began tracing his fingers through the air. Glowing runes formed in front of him, entropic energy caressed the symbols his fingers drew. "I will destroy you, it is my fate!" He whispered. They heard. The glowing symbols began to swirl about him, creating a barrier of resistance to all their attempts to get to him. "I have run far too long, a line is to be drawn." he whispered once more. More figures formed. They came like a wave of endless night, welling up around him. Vailen stopped and waited. All their attempts failed to get to him. Closing his eyes he thought about what he was to do next. "You failed to truly defeat me you pathetic beings." snarled the man in defiance. "You forgot.....I split my soul with the aid of the Ebon Skull." The wave slowed, thoughts formed in their minds. Somewhere the remains of a death knight lay. Crumpled in the jungles of Trinsic. "Yesssss....you remember don't you?" He asked tauntingly. They did. "Where?" they pleaded. They didn't know. How convenient. "For you to find...." he whispered to them as his fingers began to trace new symbols. "We will defeat you!" they taunted back, trying to regain their hold over this man. "Nay.....you cannot or you would have already done so," he retorted as the new runes were finished. To himself he thought. Maybe she could hear his last goodbye. "Velaska, I love you." A tear formed in his eyes as the runes began to swirl. "At last gentlemen, you must excuse me," he mocked, "I have a deal to make with a brother and sister on another plane." The wave collapsed in one last vain attempt to capture him. A portal opened in front of Vailen, and through it he went. The voices heard him as the portal closed, "Mithaniel....Erollisi.....I have something to offer you." The Nothing screamed in agony. NOT AGAIN!</p>

<p align=left>The birds flew from their perched positions as the men began to dig. Here it is, one of them exclaimed. The five of them had worked long and hard finding this treasure. Some unlucky fool dropped the map some time back. It did not foretell of what they would find, only some co- ordinates and a vague drawing. Ding! The sound of metal on metal lifted their souls. Treasure at last they all thought. When the five of them had finished excavating the site, their souls dropped. Just a skeleton in a suit of black plate. "Take the armor off it, maybe we can sell it to some museum." As they began pulling at the armor, they found it did not have clasps or any way of getting the armor off. This puzzled the men. How did this person get in the armor? Reaching down, one of the men examined half a sword that was pierced through the chest of the body. It gleamed of enchantment. Taking a tool from the lock-picks kit, the man began to pull the blade free. As it was released from the bodies chest, two red eyes fired to life in the helm. A hand grasp the one man, breaking his neck in a vice-like grip. The jungle of Trinsic grew quiet as each man fell. The entropic knight walked these lands once more.</p>
