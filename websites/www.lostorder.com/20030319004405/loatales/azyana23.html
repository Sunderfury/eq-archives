<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Twenty-Three</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I had moved on from Unrest to High Pass, the Southern Karanas to Rivervale, and now find myself back at Unrest. I was able to reach the 20th circle of knowledge where I can now wear my golden one's family name, which I will wear proudly till the day I live no more. How odd it seems, I traveled far but returned to where he thought it would be best for me to obtain the knowledge I'll need to progress.</p>

<p align=left>My golden one spoke of his family name and his search for the truth of his father. I don't believe he'll sleep well at night without finding out what truly happened to him. He was vague in what he spoke of when it came to his plans on finding out what happened, but I do know it weighs heavy on his mind. Whatever it'll take to help him find out the truth I will be there for him and assist him in any way I can. I am just afraid I will not be able to help him on my own. Perhaps once I find out what we'll need to do I'll have to ask the others within our family of LOA to assist us.</p>

<p align=left>I must remember to send my golden one a note to let him know that I have returned home.</p>
