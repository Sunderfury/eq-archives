<p align=left><b>Return of the Bloodwake</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Enosh walked out of the Naval Academy's headquarters, and strode over to his new ship.  The Darkwake was a small vessel, much the same size as his first ship.  It wasn't much but it gave Enosh the power to roam the seas once more.</p>

<p align=left>As Enosh aproched his ship he noticed something amiss.  The smell of death was strong upon the air, and his mainsail lay in tatters upon the mast.  A cold chill grabbed his heart as Enosh broke into a run.</p>

<p align=left>Upon the deck of the Darkwake, Enosh's eyes lay witness to a scene of carnage.  The corpse of a young lady was lashed to the mast, and he innards and blood we strewn about the half of the ship.  Tears welled up in Enosh's eyes as his blood begain to boil.</p>

<p align=left>SWINE!!!</p>

<p align=left>Enosh screamed before dropping to his knees, his voice echoing off of the trees.</p>

<p align=left>Climbing aboard his ship, he untied the colorless corpse from the mast. Laying her down on the deck he summoned all the magical energies within himself.  "AN CORP!" he screamed, knowing this spell was far beyond his ability yet still trying.  With that colapsed in an exausted heap on the deck.</p>

<p align=left>When he awoke he found the young woman sleeping soundly next to him. Enosh then stood up, effortlessly scouping the sleeping maiden into his arms and carried her back to the Acadamy.</p>

<p align=left>Enosh looked back at his ship, at her tattered sail and blood smeared deck.  On the vessels prow, where just days earlier he had carfully pained the ships name he saw that the blood from the slain maiden had run down the side of the hull.  In a mix of blood and black paint was the word "Bloodwake".</p>
