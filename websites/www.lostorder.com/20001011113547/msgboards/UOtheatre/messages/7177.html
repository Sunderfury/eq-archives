Again, this skill does not raise significantly above the low 90's, so I only have 92 Peacemaking. So I am successful 9 out of 10 times. I would like to be GM in that skill since that would mean I am successful "nearly all" the time. I hope. <p>Peacemaking has a lot of good uses, taking into consideration it is a defensive, not offensive skill. I can move about pretty effectively by making peace and running out of sight, or even by continually peacemaking (but beware when it fails). Whatever happens I do not wish for any more delay between the successes, yet I understand the value of that for the less accomplished. It has a lot of other uses, but I understand the diversity of opinion too. Each to their own. I don't want to be anyone's clone, thank you.<br></font>
