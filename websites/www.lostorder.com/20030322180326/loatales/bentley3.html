<p align=left><b>Side Effects (Bentley's Cure Part Two)</b><br><i>by Bentley</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>That light is so bright it hurts to look at it….I must save him….I must…The pain…my..my hands are on fire….I can smell the flesh burning off of my hands……</p>

<p align=left>Bentley finally awoke from his sleep, soaked in sweat. He sat up and shook his head and wondered why was he having nightmares now after everything he had been through this was the first time he had ever had a nightmare, let alone a dream in over 15 years. He looked at his hands, they had finally healed from the burns that were cause several days ago when he grabbed his friend Jared as Jared was turning into some type of light creature. Strange changes had begun to occur ever since Solar and Atlantia had performed the ritual on him to free him from Maria’s hold. His heart still wants to follow in the path of the light, but he is afraid he is losing the battle for his soul.</p>

<p align=left>True the cure did free him from Maria, but it has made him into a full vampire….a daywalker. The fairy dust that he had begun to rely on has also begun to fail him. Now he must find other ways to control his hunger. He looks back over towards his bed and sees Amanda still is sleeping and shakes his head. “How have I let myself give in to these urges…its not like me to use people like this,” Bentley thought to himself. “What have I become”, muttered Bentley as he walked to the other side of the room. </p>

<p align=left>He sat down in a chair next to the fireplace and stared into the fire. He let his mind wander back to when he was a rich, young noble and life to good and easy. All of a sudden he got a chill, he went to the window and saw something in the shadows…it stared back at him with red glowing eyes. His face went blank as he stared back and his eyes turned red. An evil grin came upon his face as he nodded to the creature.</p>
