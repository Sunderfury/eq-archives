<p align=left><b>Memories</b><br><i>by Joxer</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Azzameen leaned against the rocky outcropping, waiting patiently for the druid to return from his scouting. For many days he and Perth had been watching the valley, waiting for the passing of the fiends, Olog and Gorb. A week past, the vicious Ogre and his Troll companion had passed this way from the Innothule Swamp to terrorize the locals. Perth and Azzameen were hunting and came across the carnage. Azzameen had never seen the wood elf weep over so many slain humans – and the image of Perth carrying slain children to a funeral pyre was something Azzameen would never forget.</p>

<p align=left>Perth ran as swift as a wolf through the tall grasses that grew between the high cliffs. He could almost picture his brother Aanlain in pursuit, just as they had done when they were young. It seemed so long ago that he had been back to Kelethin – a long time indeed. He remembered the long days helping his father Denethrul in the gardens, tending the various herbs that he grew under the great Kelethin trees. He remembered the late nights talking to Aeriel, his mother, before heading to sleep under the far away moon – lulled by the gentle whispers of the woodland fairies.</p>

<p align=left>Then he remembered the horror of Emperor Crush.</p>

<p align=left>It happened during a massive attack by the Crushbone orcs against Kelethin. The hatchetmen poured through the trees like ants and chopped furiously at the great trees that supported Kelethin. The wood elves rained arrows and rocks down upon the horde; the air was filled with the streaks of magic and burning orc flesh. But still the monsters came. After a great tree fell, the orcs streamed up a fallen ramp and into the city itself – killing anything that stood against them. Then the slavers came. Before the orcs were finally driven back by the Druid grandmasters, many fair elf men, women and children were taken back to Crushbone as prizes for the pits.</p>

<p align=left>The rescue operation had gone very poorly. A great army of wood elf rangers and Druids, the Warriors of Tunare, lead an attack against Crushbone a few weeks later to rescue the slaves and exact revenge upon Emperor Crush. The initial attack had gone well, or appeared so, as the orcs were caught by surprise and forced back beyond the putrid waters. Whether this was a ploy or not, no one will ever know. Then the legionnaires came, followed by their warmaster and a strange dark elf. The brave elves braced themselves against the onslaught. A great shadow fell across the scene as many elves began to die.</p>

<p align=left>During the combat, several scouts including Perth and Aanlain had moved to the area where they believed the slave pits were. What they found horrified them - the slavers were killing all the captives, in retribution for the attack against Crushbone. Charging against the slavers, the scouts unleashed nature’s fury unto the unsuspecting Slavers. The terrible power of Tunare was shown that day and nature’s wrath was truly terrific.</p>

<p align=left>Perth can still here the cries of Aanlain as they held their dying mother and father. The dead Slaver that had done this to them lay in a pool of bright crimson blood near the water. Bodies of friends and cousins were scattered about as most of the rangers were slain by the Crushbone horde. How badly the fight had turned!</p>

<p align=left>It was the dark elf Dvinn that rallied the orcs into frenzy and turned the fight.</p>

<p align=left>* * *</p>

<p align=left>Azzameen looked again into the valley, scanning the area for the wood elf. Growing increasingly impatient, the high elf began memorizing Eye of Zomm. Not seeing any signs of movement down below, the wizard summoned the Eye and sent it downward into the grass. It moved fast above the weeds – examining the area for any trace of the absent wood elf. Approaching a small tree, Azzameen saw Perth crouched behind an exposed root – looking down into a deep depression in the grass. The high elf quickly cancelled the spell, not wanting to give away Perth’s location.</p>

<p align=left>Perth saw a great Ogre and Troll camped out within a deep hole. They were eating what appeared to be human sized legs and drinking out of large kegs. Scattered about the hole were various stolen chests, half eaten cows, rusty weapons and many, many human sized bones. Without a doubt these were the two monsters that Perth and Azzameen sought.</p>

<p align=left>Summoning a spell, Perth stood by the tree with his shield and hammer outstretched. The sky grew dark and a great wind began to blow. </p>

<p align=left>He cried aloud, “By the embodiment of Tunare, I call forth nature’s fury to cleanse ye. I summon the stinging wasps and biting flies of your homeland to tear at thee!”</p>

<p align=left>The ogre and troll looked up quickly and reached for their bloodstained weapons. Just as they did, a great swarm of biting and stinging insects fell upon them. Seeing the Druid through the cloud, they both snarled and charged at the tree – their steps slowed due to the pain of the stinging swarm. Perth smiled and ran quickly through the grass. Olog and Gorb stupidly followed the druid to the area where Azzameen waited.</p>

<p align=left>Azzameen stood on top of the ridge, his runed staff in both hands. An eerie yellow light grew from his body as he summoned a devastating bolt of lightning. There was a bright flash of white light and the smell of sulfur as the bolt was unleashed at Olog. </p>

<p align=left>A great scream sounded from the maimed Ogre. Olog’s right arm, just below the elbow, was nothing but a burned stump. Pieces of bubbling flesh splashed against his bronze armor and he fell backwards into the grass. The stinging swarm still biting at his exposed skin, Olog struggled to stand then a great painful wind sliced through his torso and again he was thrown back. Gorb, running to his unmoving friend’s side, looked up and saw the wood elf standing a short distance away recovering from the spell he had just cast. The Troll Shaman, sensing the elf’s distraction, charged quickly up the hill and swung its war mace at the elf. </p>

<p align=left>Perth, failing to dodge the blow, was hit square in the chest by the crushing attack. With the snapping of ribs, the force of the blow threw the druid against the high rocky wall, where he collapsed in a broken heap. Seeing his enemy down, Gorb then turned to look for the Wizard.</p>

<p align=left>Azzameen, almost out of energy, saw what happened to Perth and feared. He knew that he didn’t have enough mana to gate to safety, nor would he even do so not knowing if Perth was slain or living – so to the death he decided. “So be it Troll, to the death.”</p>

<p align=left>Summoning the last of his energies, Azzameen hurled a flaming ball of fire toward the Troll then charged to attack with his magic staff. The magical fire engulfed the Troll as it made his way up a steep ramp that lead to the Wizard. Screaming in agony, Gorb still came – intent on finishing the wizard – it’s scaly skin cracking and spitting under the hot flames.</p>

<p align=left>The two met midway on the ramp and Azzameen, being much quicker, swung his great staff toward the monster. Gorb, remarkably fast for a Troll, dodged the attack then countered with a fierce blow with his mace. Trying to block the mighty mace with his staff, Azzameen fell beneath the attack, the runed staff splintering into a thousand glittering fragments. The wizard looked up at the hissing troll, waiting for the killing blow. </p>

<p align=left>As the troll raised his gore stained mace, the downed wizard heard a tremendous rushing of wind and sounds of roaring thunder. An unseen force gripped the burning troll and sent the bewildered screaming beast crashing onto the sharp, broken rocks below. Easing himself up, Azzameen saw a shimmering wolf, running down the ramp and towards Perth – apparently his savior.</p>

<p align=left>* * *</p>

<p align=left>“You must get Perth to a healer or he will die. His body is broken, his spirit in turmoil. I can do no more for him.”</p>

<p align=left>Azzameen nodded at the speaking wolf. </p>

<p align=left>“When he is revived, you must swear to give him this message: that he and Aanlain are not alone. There is another in his family that lives, although in slavery. When Perth and Aanlain are ready and their spirits cleansed, they shall be reunited.”</p>

<p align=left>“Give him this message in return for Tunare’s blessing of life and your debt will be paid.”</p>

<p align=left>Again Azzameen could only nod. A great feeling of peace, the rushing of wind and again the roaring thunder – then the wolf vanished. The high elf wondered about the wolf, recorded the information within his journal and sat down next to his broken friend.</p>

<p align=left>“Friend Perth, let me rest for just a little while so that I might regain the energy to gate us home. To the healer will ye go with me by your side – a friend’s duty and my right. We have slain the enemy and avenged the children – rest now knowing that the righteous have won.”</p>

<p align=left>* * *</p>

<p align=left>A short while after Azzameen and Perth left the valley a thin figure, hooded and dressed in ebony robes, materialized by the body of Olog. Kneeling down, the figure reached into his robes and pulled forth a blood red spider about the size of a halfling’s fist. Placing the spider on the ogre’s lips, the creature crawled into his mouth. Walking over to the shattered and burnt troll, the strange figure did the same with Gorb. </p>

<p align=left>Olog opened his eyes sharply and looked about for the wood elf. Seeing no enemies, he struggled to regain his footing. Although dizzy, he felt strong. Looking at his fat body, the ogre stupidly noticed that his right arm was whole, unburned and intact.</p>

<p align=left>“Urm. Whut hapeen? Must be bad dreem me had but oww me hed hurtz.”</p>

<p align=left>Looking about, Olog saw his Troll friend Gorb laying against some rocks next to a long ramp that lead upward out of the valley. Heading that way, the ogre tripped and fell as soon as he started walking, just barely catching himself with his great arms. Looking at his feet, Olog saw a bloody arm, burnt at one end and still wearing the bronze armor favored by the Grobb guards. Rubbing his right arm, the ogre stood and began to run toward Gorb – a fearful light in his beady red eyes.</p>

<p align=left>Far above the valley, on a high outcropping of rock, the robed figure looked down upon the Ogre and chuckled.</p>
