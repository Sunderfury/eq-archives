<p align=left><b>Ode to Jared</b><br><i>by Sally</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Hello Love:</p>

<p align=left>Jared Farstrider...I want to prove to you that my love for you is much greater than my sister Daisy's. You really hurt my feelings last night running away from me...so I wrote this little ode to express my true love for thee.</p>

<p align=left>Ode to Jared<br>
I love thee Jared...<br>
No matter how much I declare it you still run from me like a ferret.<br>
And even if we are appart for now...I will always follow thee like a love sick cow.<br>
So take heed my love Jared...I will never be far.<br>
For you see I know you are my true love and I will get thee my dove.</p>

<p align=left>So love now I have made my claim to you public so this warning is to my no good sister Daisy...STAY AWAY FROM JARED HE BELONGS TO ME!</p>

<p align=left>Now I don't want you other gents to get jealous...I can take very good care of all of ye.</p>
