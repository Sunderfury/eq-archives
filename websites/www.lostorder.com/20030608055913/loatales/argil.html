<p align=left><b>LOA Stalked Death Itself...</b><br><i>by Argil</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>...in the dungeon of Befallen.</p>

<p align=left>And unfortunately, we found it.</p>

<p align=left>The fearless Troll Shadow Knight Bagulan led Waran, Kojo, Dargo, Azzameen, and I into the bowels of this dungeon into a fierce battle with a Theurgist and then an Elf Skeleton. The Theurgists are fearsome enemies indeed, able to infect an entire party with a festering disease in mere seconds. Their mindless pets fight on, even after their masters have died! We crossed through the third door, and the battle began in earnest. Dozens of greater skeletons, ghouls, and pesky will-o-wisps fell before our onslaught. We slew many Necro variants, including a few Theurgists, but sadly none wore the coveted Gossamer Robe.</p>

<p align=left>Glorious pitched battles raged accross several rooms as the undead minions fell before us. As the night wore on, Azzameen had to bid us farewell, and then Kojo. At this point Dargo wondered aloud whether we should execute a tactical withdrawl, having lost our primary healer. We were joined by Aanlain the Druid at this point, and our blood ran too hot to heed Dargo's words. We pressed on.</p>

<p align=left>Well, ye can guess what happened next. Fresh from a fierce battle with yet another Necro Theurgist, his pet, a greater skeleton, and a ghoul, our tanks were sorely wounded and our healers low on mana as we rested. At this point we were assaulted by three additional greater skeletons. Things looked bleak indeed when a ghoul joined the fray. I recognized him as the lone survivor of our previous engagament and the source of our new opponents. I blew his foul body to eternmal damnation with a single spell.</p>

<p align=left>That looked to be the turning point of the battle... until yet another Theurgist and his pet arrived...</p>

<p align=left>At that point things got very bad very quickly. I looked on in frustration, knowing that to engage in this chaotic melee would be suicide. Bagulan called for an adjournment to the secret door, but our forces were in disarray. I had a desperate choice between med'ing for mana to gate and fleeing with my brethren: I chose the latter, hoping I might somehow help another to escape. I was wrong. One by one we fell. My last conscious act was to stagger to a point near the bodies of the fighters, in the hopes that my body could be recovered before it was claimed by the vile necromancers of Befallen...</p>

<p align=left>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p align=left>To make a very long and frustrating story short, all bodies were recovered, but not without additional loss of life. I must say that everyone comported themselves with courage and honor to the last. In retrospect, I'm struck by the fact that not one of us fled the field prematurely; every man stayed to the bitter end. If one must die, best to die with friends like these.</p>

<p align=left>Blood brothers of Befallen, I swear to you that our deaths shall not go unavenged. We shall crush the skeletons in the corridors; we shall root out the ghouls from the shadows; we shall chase the wisps to the depths of that dungeon and back again! We shall shake the very roots of that accursed place until the last Theurgist cries out "Enough! Have mercy! Who are you, terrible warriors of the Light?"</p>

<p align=left>And we shall say to him, "Foul spawn of Innoruk, we are your worst nightmare incarnate. We are the Lost Order of Akalabeth."</p>
