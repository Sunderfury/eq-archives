<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk
eyed the sign on the tavern with apprehension. &quot;I do not think this is a good
idea,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We&#146;re just
stoppin&#146; in for a drink or two,&quot; said Bierfreund.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;What about the
goblins?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;What about
&#145;em?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Are we not
supposed to be fighting them?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye, but not
before we put down a few ales.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It is not wise
to drink before a battle.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund shuddered
and crossed himself religiously. &quot;&#146;Cause you&#146;re an outsider, I&#146;ll let
that one pass. It ain&#146;t your fault you were born a human. But you got to understand,
you&#146;re in the Dwarf Lands, now. And to dwarves, there ain&#146;t nothin&#146; more
important than ale, save for gems and Brell Serilis himself. We drink ale before going out
to battle. We drink ale after we come back from battle. Heck, we&#146;d probably drink ale
during battle, only the ale would spill. A dwarf ain&#146;t a dwarf unless he&#146;s got
ale pumpin&#146; through his veins.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I am not a
dwarf,&quot; Greyhawk protested.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye,
that&#146;s the sad truth,&quot; said Bierfreund. &quot;But trust me&#133;one flagon of
dragon breath ale, and you&#146;ll fit right in with the rest of us.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font size="4" color="#0080C0">Pub Kal was
always busy in the evenings. When the dwarves were not mining or killing goblins, they
were drinking. And they drank a lot. Ale was Kaladim&#146;s chief import commodity; rumor
has it that the main reason for establishing a ship route between Freeport and Kaladim was
to keep enough ale in stock.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The dwarven bartender
raised his eyebrows as the eleven adventurers filed into the tavern. He didn&#146;t even
have to say anything; he simply started filling up mugs of ale.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund grabbed
two of the mugs and handed one to Greyhawk. &quot;This here is the finest ale that Kaladim
has to offer. Ale like this ought to be savored.&quot; Bierfreund drank the ale in three
gulps and slammed the flagon down, wiping his beard. &quot;Alas, I ain&#146;t no good at
savoring.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk looked down
at the dark brown liquid in his mug, and frowned hesitantly.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Go on,&quot;
said Bierfreund. &quot;It won&#146;t kill you.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The shaman shrugged.
&quot;When in Kaladim&#133;&quot; He raised the flagon, and took a great gulp. Almost
immediately, he realized why it was called dragon breath ale. It felt as though he had
just swallowed fire. He sputtered and coughed, but nothing seemed to help.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Here, drink
this,&quot; said Bierfreund, handing him another mug of ale.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"><font color="#0080C0">ONE
HOUR LATER&#133;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk crawled
around on the floor and glared at the dwarves. &quot;Look!&quot; he shouted.
&quot;I&#146;m a polar bear! Raaaarrrr!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;He&#146;s
blasted,&quot; said Kherghon.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;How many ales
did you give him, Bier?&quot; asked Walterus.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Dunno. Lost
count after six.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You think
HE&#146;S drunk&#133;you should have seen Corwin last Saturday!&quot; The dwarves laughed.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Will you people
shut up?&quot; shouted Jarlaxle drunkenly. &quot;I&#146;m trying to conshentrate!&quot; He
aimed his dagger at the dart board on the wall, and launched it through the air. There was
a crash and a tinkling noise as one of the windows broke. The dwarves roared with
laughter.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Shut up!&quot;
he yelled. &quot;I was jusht warming up.&quot; He readied another dagger.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Guys, I propose
a toast,&quot; said Dargo, standing up. Just then, Jarlaxle threw his dagger, and this
time it landed in Dargo&#146;s shoulder. Dargo scowled down at the blade, then plucked it
out and tossed it aside.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;A toast,&quot;
he continued. &quot;To dwarven ale!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;To dwarven
ale!&quot; roared the crowd.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That reminds me
of a song!&quot; cried Penaden, who propped his legs up on the bar and plucked at the
strings on his lute.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0"><br>
&quot;The very first ale is like a punch to the head<br>
Your brain is on fire, and you wish you were dead</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You keep going
after the second ale, though you should have stopped there<br>
You&#146;ll feel like hell tomorrow morning, but you don&#146;t bloody care</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You feel very
brave as you finish the third flagon<br>
You start to get ideas &#150; &#145;Hey guys, let&#146;s fight a dragon!&#146;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Things start to
go wrong after ale number four<br>
The room starts to spin, and you wind up on the floor</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You don&#146;t
stop with the fifth ale, though you know that you should<br>
&#145;Cause even dwarven women are starting to look good!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0"><br>
Jarlaxle laughed. &quot;Now that was a good one!&quot; He looked around, but none of the
dwarves were smiling.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Let&#146;s hang
the elf by his own lute strings,&quot; growled Walterus.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Sounds good to
me,&quot; growled Kherghon. &quot;Let&#146;s get him!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Death to the
elves!&quot; cried Dargo, eager to join the battle, though he didn&#146;t really know why
there were fighting.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"><img src="http://www.gamecore.net/everquest/screenshots/santi_end11_brawl.jpg" width="284" height="261" alt="santi_end11_brawl.jpg (21197 bytes)"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">In seconds, the
tavern was in complete chaos as chairs, empty flagons and dwarves flew through the air.
There was a loud clatter as Bierfreund crashed into a table at the shadowy end of the room
where Rothan and Eshay were kissing. They did not even seem to notice the dwarf &#150; in
fact, they seemed oblivious everything in the room, save for each other. Bierfreund stood
up, shook his head, grunted and then charged back into the battle.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Meanwhile, Kherghon
had jumped on top of Penaden and was in the process of hitting him with what looked like a
large trout. Jarlaxle had picked up Dargo by the legs and was spinning him around in a
circle. Walterus was frantically beating Greyhawk with his club as the large barbarian bit
him in the leg.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Kileyan, what
are you doing behind the bar?&quot; shouted Jarlaxle. &quot;Do something!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I am!&quot;
said Kileyan, taking another gulp from his tankard of ale. He looked up and saw a tall,
shadowy figure standing in the doorway.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Uh oh,&quot; he
said.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The battle came to an
abrupt end as Ralineth quietly entered the tavern. The archdruid said nothing, but his
eyes seemed to smolder with anger as he looked around the room at the piles of bodies and
broken furniture.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We have one
chance,&quot; said Ralineth, &quot;to save the world. And where do I find the champions of
Faydwer? I find them brawling in a filthy alehouse.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The heroes looked
down at the floor, guiltily.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well, what do
you have to say for yourselves?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Kileyan raised his
flagon. &quot;To the end of the world!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;To the end of
the world!&quot; roared the crowd.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Ralineth felt like
beating his head against the wall. How could he make these people understand that they
were Norrath&#146;s last hope? What could he say to motivate them?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You know,&quot;
said the archdruid, &quot;if the world comes to an end tonight, there will be no more
ale.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;No more
ale?&quot; whispered Bierfreund, turning pale.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;And if there is
no more ale, you will have to be sober, forever.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The dwarves cried out
in anguish.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Kherghon rose to his
feet, unsteadily. &quot;Fellow dwarves,&quot; he said loudly, &quot;and pig-stinkin&#146;
elves,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Ralineth has told us of a great danger to this land, and I
say we should forth at once on this, the most important quest of all time. We must&#133;we
MUST save the ale!&quot;</font></font></p>
