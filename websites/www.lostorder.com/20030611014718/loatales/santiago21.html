<p align=left><b>Captain's Log: Sea Monsters</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Wenzday, the 8th.

<p align=left>Well, I'm still alive – though it was a near thing, I tell ye! Some folks say yer life passes b'fore yer eyes…well that's a load o' dung. When yer crossin' swords in battle, ye don't got time fer no bloody flashbacks!</p>

<p align=left>I knew we was in fer trouble when I looked off the port side an' saw somethin' big an' dark headed right for us. A sea snake it was, one o' the biggest ones I ever seen! (not countin' me own masculinity – but I ain't one to brag). Anyways, it came up out o' the water an' thar I was lookin' in to a giant mouth full o' razor-sharp teeth. It's true…I could o' used one o' them teeth to shave meself!</p>

<p align=left>So I started to give 'im the what-for with me trusty blade (which I'd trust more if it wasn't so banged-up…have to get Broog to look it over sometime). Well, it was kinda like stickin' a pin into a horse…it din't do much harm, but it sure made 'im mad! So then he starts breathin' fire at me. Blimey! I thought me own breath was bad!</p>

<p align=left>Well, I still say I would o' had 'im. Mought o' took all day, but I would o' seen to it. But then thar was a great big splash off the starboard (thar's the right side o' the ship, fer all ye lubbers out thar). So I look over, an' thar's this big ol' water demon, tryin' to crawl up on board me boat!</p>

<p align=left>The demon starts spittin' spells at me faster than ye can say, "Hey Joe, put down that darn frog!" B'fore I know it, most o' me blood has been spilled all over the deck, an' the blood that's still in me has got poison swimmin' through it. Things is lookin' perty grim.</p>

<p align=left>So I called over to Mr. Knife an' said, "Mr. Knife, GET US THE HECK OUT O' HERE!" Poor ol' fella, he was all pale an' looked to be on the edge of a heart attack. I had to yell at 'im to come about a couple times b'fore he got his wits about 'im. But the good ol' salt came through, an' we made it clear.</p>

<p align=left>I figger I had a couple seconds o' life left to me as I fumbled through the ship's hold, lookin' fer that good ol' hangover remedy. Found it at last (at the bottom, o' course), an' poured the nasty orange liquid down me throat (aye, it tastes just like orange juice…*blech!*).</p>

<p align=left>After that, it was stiff drinks an' smooth sailin' all the way to Moonglow, whar I took shelter at the youth hostel to recuperate. Gotta love them young student nurses! *toothy grin*</p>
