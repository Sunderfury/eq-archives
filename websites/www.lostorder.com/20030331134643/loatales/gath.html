<p align=left><b>The Battle of the Saint and the Skeleton</b><br><i>by Gath of Baal</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Twas around nightfall when the galant saint strode through the clearing upon his magnificent white steed. He came up to the fountain, dismounted the horse,and sat down on one of the strong yew benches that were built beside the glittering marble structure. He took off his sparkling platemail helm and set it beside him on the bench. He then proceeded to pull out a bottle of a strange blue liquid (most likely ambrosia) and started to down the bottle very quickly.

He placed his hand on his face and rubbed the scar that was put there. "Blasted murderers, won't there ever be stability in this cursed land," spoke the saint. He then reached into his backpack and produced a head with a very haggard and swarthy look. "Rest in peace Gaul," he said. Then he stood up and threw the skull into the brush a good fifty yards away.

At that moment a young man covered in blood dropped down infront of the saint. Quickly Zareah dropped down in front of the man and began to wrap bandages around the gushing wound in his lower abdomen. "Who did this to you?" At that point the man began to cough up blood violently."He.....no face.....eyes, red....*cough*...

"Stay still and try not to move." Zareah picked up the man and put him up on the edge on the fountain. "Now tell me again,what happened?!" The man looked down at his wound and noticed the bandages began to slow down the flow of blood. "I was walking around in the woods and saw a man...that was not a man....he came up and asked me a few questions." *Zareah nods* Then a zombie walked up and I killed it. "Then I said something about brainless undead." *the man begins to cough up more blood*A t that point he went ballistic and....."

At that moment the heard the rhythmic beating of a horse's hooves. Then a whoosh followed by a craking noise and the man's head flew off his shoulders into the fountain. The lifeless body followed shortly after and collapsed into the fountain with a loud splash.

"You animal Gath,I should have known twas you up to no good!" *The skeleton shifts in his saddle and chuckles slightly* Hmmmm very clever breather you are quite the bright one aren't ye?" *Zareah begins to place his helm atop his head* "Grrrrr, spare me the sarcasm you will now pay for thine actions!"

*Zareah pulls out his magical katana and steps toward the skeleton* "Hmmm, if it is a fight ye wish so be it,lets see if your bark is really worse than your bite!" *upon saying that Gath dismounts the horse and swings at Zareah* The blow is deflected off of the shield and Zareah counterattacks and strikes a blow into the hollow ribcage.With a slight chuckle Gath shifts his weight and throws Zareah over one of the benches and into a hedge. "Hahaha is that the best you got breather?" The saint gets up and thrusts his shoulder into the huge hollow frame with an earsplitting crack. "Grrrr you will pay for that lightbringer!" Gath then strikes the strap of the platemail chest and it comes loose and falls helplessly to the ground with a loud clang. He then comes down on Zareah's shield and cleaves it in two.

"Ahhhh, skeleton you have been training I see; lets see how you manage this!" Zareah thrusts his mighty katana into Gath's eye and begins to beat on the already cracked ribcage. Gath then reaches for the katana and pulls it out of his eye and thrusts it into the liver of the saint. "So Zareah, it looks like we are both in quite a predicament; your liver seems to be a tad bruised notice the black liquid flowing forth out of the wound." *Zareah looks down at the wound* "Aye skeleton, but there's one thing you didnt take into account." *Gath grunts in confusion* "THIS," yells Zareah and shatters the skeleton's ribcage into a million pieces."Now tis time to send you back to Oblivion!"

As the katana begins to come down upon the neck of the skeleton Zareah begins to feel dizzy and staggers back. The black fluid begins to pour forth even fasters now and the Saint trips over a rock and falls down. At that moment the twang of a bow breaks the silence and an arrow plants itself in the shoulder of the saint. Following immediately after comes a raiding party of murderers from out of the woods. Gath reaches into his pack and produces a recall scroll. "Grrr next time ye wont be so lucky!" He takes the scroll in his hands and chants Kal Ort Por and dissapears with a faint chuckle.

More arrows fly through the air at the saint and plant themselves into the flesh of the now exposed chest of the saint. As they come within twenty feet of the saint, the murderers hear the sound of a trumpet. The supposed "leader" of the party turns around to his comrades with a face as pale as flour. "M..mmm..militia...run!!" The party then leaves as quickly as they came leaving the saint wounded on the ground. At that moment the saint looses consciousness and his world turns black.

The next morning he awakes to find himself in a bed being tended to by beautiful women. "My sir, that tis a nasty wound. You were out for hours. You better rest so you can recover faster," said one of the women. "Ughhh, where am I?" asked Zareah. "Why, you're at the West Yew University of course!" *Zareah sits up out of bed as if startled* "I must find him....got to,innocent people...must save them." *Zareah then looks down and notices a trickle of blood flow down his arm* "Now you have upset your wound, stay down and get some rest!" *Zareah grumbles but is not in the position to complain at the moment so he willingly complies* "Soon skeleton...your reign of terror will be put to rest, even if I have to lose an arm to do it."

*With that Zareah slumps back down in bed and dozes off into a world of slumber.....*</p>
