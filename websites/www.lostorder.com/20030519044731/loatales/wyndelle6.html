<p align=left><b>Wyndelle's Misadventures VI</b><br><i>by Wyndelle</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A whisper in the night floats softly through Wyndelle’s mind. “You are ready my boy, be well and be strong. Use your gift wisely and watch after those that can’t watch after themselves.”</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle blinked his eyes open and yawned. He sat up and took stock of his situation. He heard the sounds of water lapping gently against the shore, the soft sounds of his brother Wysll snoring in a pallet a few feet away.</p>

<p align=left>“It was all just a dream! I am still with my brothers! Wysll wake up I had the most amazing dream!” Wyndelle exclaimed. “I think not” said a gravelly voice. Frightened by the sound, Wyndelle lost his balance tripping over something next to his pallet. He landed face first and beheld the runed staff given to him by his mentor. Groaning he rolled over and beheld Gebarn holding his travel pack.</p>

<p align=left>“Gebarn!! I thought ye dead!” exclaimed the excited gnome. “Shut yer hole Wyndelle and go back ta sleep!” cried Wysll “Tis not even noon yet” mumbled the groggy gnome. Wyndelle raced to the elemental and wrapped his arms around his tail (that being the only part he could reach) in a great bear-hug.</p>

<p align=left>“Shhh keep it down, are ye tryin ta kill me?” whispered an obviously hung over Wyxle. Behind, an obviously intrigued Wyll raised an eyebrow at his younger brother.</p>

<p align=left>“Glad you could join us lad. We missed ya in Freeport yesterday” said the elder brother.</p>

<p align=left>“Yesterday!??!?! WHAT?!? I have been away for the longest time… I …. I … nn.. nevermind. You wouldn’t believe me if I told you” sighed Wyndelle.</p>

<p align=left>“Mayhap you can tell us yer story sometime soon, in the meantime we have a gnome to find. On yer feet lads!”</p>

<p align=left>And so the Walaryn adventure continues...</p>
