<p align=left><b>A Decision Made</b><br><i>by Hakadek</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>As the Bloodthirsty Ghoul staggered past him, Hakadek tossed a stun on it, allowing Walterus to strike the final blow as it stood quivering in its tracks. This should have been a great day, as the Lost Order had managed to reach the lair of the Frenzied Ghoul and were laying in wait should it appear. Yet, somehow the stark reality of the unceasing flow of death and destruction seemed too much at odds with the recent memory of a peaceful glade, a wedding ceremony and a pair of disturbingly blue eyes.</p>

<p align=left>However much he tried he could not erase the thought that those eyes were not made to look upon this sort of carnage, yet he knew that it was her chosen path in life and that he must not interfere as Brell had clearly called her to his service. </p>

<p align=left>The battle raged on with few pauses, but the evil frogs made little impression on the mighty warriors, as the Guild was fortunate in having the strength of both Walterus and Ailill in the group, together with the potent magic user and recent commoner Oncelot. Amarin was performing his usual mixture of magic aimed at strengthening and protecting the warriors, whilst ensuring that the luckless frogs were unable to depart the field of battle when they grew too weak to fight. Fellow Cleric Dearg called down destructive forces, which illuminated areas of the dungeon long kept dark as the undead smoked and burned in hopeless agony. Others of the Order came and went, Dalyn stayed for a while then left, strangely quiet; were his thoughts less troubled Dalyn’s demeanour would have concerned him more, but in his current state of mind it passed him by. Nearby the Necromancer Lillith fought her own battle in support of the group, aided only by her faithful if ghastly pet, an animated skeleton. The path she followed was as different from the Clerics as could be imagined, yet some measure of honour remained in her soul as she fought to aid the group using the dark powers at her command. This was the scene against which Hakadek fought with his own thoughts and slowly but surely lost the battle that raged within him.</p>

<p align=left>The peace and tranquillity of the Glade, and the gentle conversations in the restful space behind the waterfall seemed part of a distant memory, yet as the inevitable conclusion was reached in his mind he knew that he could not always keep her in such pleasant surroundings. </p>

<p align=left>The decision made, his thoughts began to race again. If she was to travel and minister to those in need in the heat of battle, there was yet something he could do to make her journey a little more secure. Merely heaping artefacts and precious platinum upon her would not help, and would only serve to distort her growth and give her false confidence, no, he would take the time to nurture her growing talents and skills, he could train her in the ways of the Cleric and watch over her battles when he could..</p>

<p align=left>His thoughts now clear and joyous Hakadek returned his attention to the battle still raging around him, Walterus’s flagging health was fully restored with a short prayer and another moments thought brought down Brell’s anger upon the hapless Ghoul assaulting the Orders forces and a swift thrust from Ailill finished it off . Yes, his mind was clear now and his purpose lay plainly before him, he would train her and by Brell’s grace she would become the best Cleric she could. Then with fortune and in time, perhaps she would grow to see him as more than just a teacher, as in his own mind, he knew she was more than just a student …..</p>
