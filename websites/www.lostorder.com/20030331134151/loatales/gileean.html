<blockquote>
<p align=left>On a brisk Autumn morning I awoke to the chatter of birds and a slight whispering wind. I had wondered if today would be a better day than the last. Yesterday was somewhat of a flounder walking around South Karana.</p>

<p align=left>I had gone in search of Groi Gutblade the infamous Troll the wandered these parts. After hours of mindless wandering I picked up his tracks and followed them near the reigon of Split Paw. As I came up over the hill I saw him making Idle chatter with some of the local flora. Thinkiing myself he was a bit on the insane side I figured he'd be none the ware of my approach. *Mental Note* Dont undestimate an insane Troll. He heard me coming and spun around and began whailing on me. Blast him for having good hearing. I decided a one-on one was not in my best interest and headed towards a few locals hunting the area for gnolls. I spoted a number of aquantances and asked for thier help as Groi was on the way. I shoulda kept my eye on him as some of the less honorable folks around decided they were going to take his head. Sadly thats how it ended.</p>

<p align=left>My freinds and I sauntered over to discuss this travesty with them and they all but scoffed at us. I knew it was a lost cause dealing with these ruffians so I told my friends we best leave them be and go about other things. They all agreed, albiet grumbling all the way back.</p>

<p align=left>We took up residence back at the main Split Paw Spire outside the entrance to that stench pot of a dungeon for which the spires are named. Low and behold not long were we there had some of the locals of that dungeon decided to pay us a visit. We made short work of them. But I must say I kept wondering how they knew my name and what they were going to teach me. Guess I'll never know.</p>

<p align=left>Long was the day and bloody it got and deadly it begat. A few members of my party had fallen under a ill fated defeat to a band of four Gnolls and a roving Cyclops. Luckily I managed to survive the massacre only due to my earlier travels with my elders on Cyclops and Hill Giant hunts. I learned well and helped slay the One Eyed beast with A fellow named Evaone and Qindaan. I surely mourned the loss of my friends lives. But I knew it had not been in vain. They fought as honorably and valiantly to thier deaths.</p>

<p align=left>I came to the decision that it was time for me to pull up camp for the eve and take up the good fight in the 'Marrow.</p>

<p align=left>***</p>

<p align=left>Ahh this is my entry for the day. Today was a much better day than the last. I joined up forces with some old beans of mine at the main Spire and went to town. the Fighting was good and the booty even better. I claimed for myself a Gnoll Hide Lariat and the last Scroll of those Stinking dogs history. Soon I will know all about them in detail to bring down thier shaky empire.</p>

<p align=left>Halfway through the day while practising my tracking I came across Ol'Gutbalde's tracks again...someone must have ressurected the sucker. Ah well just the better for me to poke him again. As luck would have it while tracking him he found me! HAHA too fun. I ran around him in circles to give the ol' boy a head spin. I hailed to my friends for help. This time he was all mine. As the big boy got to us we made short work of his hide. But sadly in a game of bones I lost his booty to another member. Surley I was saddned having tracked him and done the majority of the death blows to him but all in the name of good I say.</p>

<p align=left>Well the day in itself has been a good one and looking forward to tommorrow. Maybe one day you'll look back at this day and think what a good life it is.
