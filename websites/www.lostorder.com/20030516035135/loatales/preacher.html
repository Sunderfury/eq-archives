<p align=left><b>The Preacher</b><br><i>by Litchebane</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The world swam into focus around Him and the glare from the icy floor stung His eyes until He reflexively slid a protective membrane over His large black, glassy eyes. The cold radiating from all around seeped into His blue limbs and filled Him with strength. He stretched His talons skyward, glad to be alive once again. Vox had need of Him, He would serve Her well and gladly, She rewarded Her minions well.</p>

<p align=left>Pointy ears picked up the sounds of intruders into His icy home and symbols swirled before His eyes as He quickly readied himself to drive the unwanted out. Flames and sparks of green and blue danced on His claws as He cast upon Himself spells of protective power. Vox would be pleased with the souls He would soon deliver to Her. He cackled in anticipation. </p>

<p align=left>He was not overconfident however, He sent a silent plea to Vox for one He could command to aid Him in the coming struggle. Another lesser being was swiftly sent. This one had an appearence similar to the first, but was of lesser stature and contained the dull eyes of one used to being commanded. He waved an icy talon and the lesser one took position at the entranceway, awaiting the warm ones. He decided that this would be enough to take the warm one's souls. His reward would be the greater for proving his power with minimal help. He nodded in satisfaction.</p>

<p align=left>Glancing at the lesser one, He realized that this one would fall quickly without some protective magics. Drawing forth the power of Permafrost's bones, He called out for shields of cold and frost and placed them about the lesser one, covering him in a shimmering shield. It would take much for the warm ones to penetrate that and by that time He would have made sure that their bones would already be cooling on the icy floor. He squatted back on His haunches and waited for the battle to come.</p>

<p align=left>The first one to open the door danced inside so quickly that there wasn't time to react. It was making an awful noise, grating on His nerves and momentarily stunning Him in place. The delay was enough to allow the other warm ones to slip inside past the guard He had posted. He gnashed His teeth in momentary frustration and quickly commanded the lesser one to silence the noisy warm one. The lesser one snarled and launched himself at the noisy one. The yowling was cut short as a claw slashed its way through it's armor and steam rose from the open wound as red fluid oozed out. The lesser one howled in delight.</p>

<p align=left>Instead of panicking however, the warm ones quickly formed a circle around the lesser one and rained blows down upon his head. He was grudgingly impressed with the speed at which they recovered but it would avail them nothing. In the end, their souls would feed Vox's insatiable appetite. </p>

<p align=left>Aaaaacckk! The noisy warm one had recovered and unmindful of the lesser one's attempt to silence it for good, had begun yowling again. Mystic symbols floated forth and surrounded the warm ones as they hacked and slashed at the lesser one. It was time He made his presence felt.</p>

<p align=left>Launching Himself off the platform where He had waited, He dug His talons into the back of a tall warm one covered in a bronze shell. He scored gouges into the shell and felt the warm flesh rip beneath his claws. He growled in pleasure, setting Himself to the task for which He had been born. </p>

<p align=left>Not satisfied with the damage He had caused, He called forth the powers Vox had given Him, and directed a bolt of pure energy down upon the one He had just attacked. It staggered under the assault and yelled something out. He had always assumed that their intelligence was rudimentary at best, but they wasted no time in leaving off their assault on the lesser one and turning to Him. </p>

<p align=left>When the tall bronze one turned, He gave a small start, it had claws like Him! What blasphemy was this? Surely Vox would not have blessed a warm one so? It must have killed a cold one and taken It's claws to use against Him. Snarling, He redoubled His assault, calling again for the power to strike those that would dare to invade the home of Vox . Smoke rose from the tall bronze one's armor as the bolt hit again, but it didn't pause as it raked it's stolen claws across His face, blinding Him for a moment. Before He could recover, strikes from multiple positions around him gouged his icy flesh. Tendrils of warm panic began to creep through His veins, and He screamed at the lesser one to finish the warm ones or suffer eternal torment at His hands. The lesser one squealed in fear and began to gouge and claw the bronze one in earnest, but as fast as he could tear it's flesh, it healed again. One in a black shell and another in a soft shell that appeared to barely cover it's warm flesh would make a few gestures and the wounds would seal themselves. He began to wonder if He would be the one sending souls or if He might be making the trip instead.</p>

<p align=left>In desperation He bagan to cast his strongest magics to smite down these warm mounds of flesh. Time and time again, He would be interrupted by a quick stab here, a slash there, a kick here again. His life energies were quickly fading and for all the lesser one's attempts, the warm ones were winning. A smashing blow from the one in black made a crunching sound as it smashed one shoulder and His arm hung limp, useless at His side. Raising His good arm heavenward, He called for Vox's aid in this, His most desperate time. Vox's energies flowed through Him and He felt more restored. His wounds healed. His bones mended. Courage siezed His heart in an icy grip. </p>

<p align=left>The attacks were unceasing however, the warm ones were too strong, too many. They worked well together and He realized that He had been overconfident after all. He called on Vox's power again and again, but it was too little, too late. He was only prolonging the inevitable. A final slash from one of the warm ones sent him crashing to the icy floor, the same floor he had promised would cool the warm one's bones. As His vision faded, He finally understood what the warm ones were yelling as they hacked the lesser one to pieces. </p>

<p align=left>"For the Lost Order! For the Brotherhood! Death to the icy ones! Death to Vox!"</p>
