<p align=left><b>There Is Another</b><br><i>by Lery</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The rain had been coming down for days now with no end in site. Lery had been perfecting his skills and gaining fame through the land. I don’t think he knows about me yet but I am his guardian. His father Mjolnir had assigned me to watch over him and make sure he follows the virtues and stays on the right path. Times have been rough lately for Lery with much financial distress but I believe he is making his way through this land with his head held high. There is still one thing that haunts me, which I do not know if I should tell Lery or not. His father and I where very close friends and was well known through the land as the ladies man. He traveled all of Sosaria and I tell you we had some good times in all the local pubs. Most of the town’s folk would be at awe at Mjolnir’s presence and the ladies would just flock to him. I see now where Lery gets his dashing good looks. Mjolnir was even said to have had a brief fling with Lord British’s daughter at one time or another but that is another story. I have come to find out that Lery has two brothers in the Lost Order of Akalabeth and does not even know it. These two men are great warriors and are of somewhat and older age than Lery is. His one brother Phenom is the oldest. Phenom has been trained in the finest schools of all of Sosaria and is said to be a member of the Hammer Unit of the Lost Order of Akalabeth. They say he fights in many battles with other warring guilds and is a tremendous fencer. Then there is Spawn. Spawn is a skilled Macer and is said to be a Guardian of the Lost Order of Akalabeth. Spawn spends his days waiting in the shadows ready to strike at a moment’s notice on anyone that dare bring harm to his fellow mates. Spawn and Phenom are not seen around the village to much as they spend there days and nights perfecting there skills and fighting in bloody battles that the Lost Order of Akalabeth does not fully partake in. Looking back on things I realize that Mjolnir had three great sons and hopefully one day they will all be re-united. As Mjolnir passed on to another world in his final words he had said to me “There are others, find them, unite them, and all will be restored.” I have yet to figure out what that means but perhaps one day I shall. </p>
