<p align=left><b>Enter the Solf</b><br><i>by Xirius</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The sun shone bright in Freeport, keeping the bats at bay, and the beetles scurrying about. Bright as it was, nothing seemed to penetrate the aura of darkness cursed to this town. A long time haven for cutthroats and smugglers, the denizens of Freeport had only increased in number, but certainly not in character. One look into the lifeless eyes of the guards, and ye know that they weren't there to protect ye. But if there was information sought, an item to be found, or a favor to be bought, Freeport was the place to be.</p>

<p align=left>Walking towards the temple, Xirius contemplated his recent decisions. He attempted to help those in need, yet failed to retain some of whom he held dearest. Questions of his past and purpose in this land haunted his dreams, night after night. Just as most desperate folk would, he too sought salvation in Freeport. But whether he would succumb to temptation or not, was an entirely different matter. Clinging to his fate with unmerciful will, Xirius slowly approached a robed figure by the fountain.</p>

<p align=left>"Greetings barbarian. What brings ye to my fair city?" asked the Solf.</p>

<p align=left>"Certainly not the wine or women," replied Xirius.</p>

<p align=left>"Oh, come now barbarian! Whatever ye seek, we can provide," answered the Solf in a serious tone.</p>

<p align=left>"What if that which I seek is immaterial?" questioned Xirius emphatically.</p>

<p align=left>The Solf lowered his head and stared into the fountain for a moment, as if he were searching for something.</p>

<p align=left>"Sometimes fate lurks in the strangest of places barbarian. If ye are.....brave enough to look."</p>

<p align=left>Xirius had heard rumors of the Solf in various ports, most of them being words caution and heed. Yet one rumor stood true in every town, that he was the only one who could fulfill any request, be it for betterment or not.</p>

<p align=left>"I be the last of my clan, and I seek what they sought before their demise," stated Xirius.</p>

<p align=left>"I see," answered the Solf as he lifted his head. "Tell me barbarian, how much do ye value your soul?"</p>
