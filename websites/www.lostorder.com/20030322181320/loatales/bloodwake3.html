<p align=left><b>Return of the Bloodwake, Part III</b><br><i>by Gloomshade</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The good Captain Flam carefully carried me into the new Academy. I carefully took note of every detail for later use. It had been a while since I directly Possessed a body, but at least the Necromancers had raised a solid zombie for me. The illusion magic should well hide the body's true ghastly form until I was through here. Splitting my concentration between manipulating the cadaver and clouding the Captain's mind, I tried to reserve some attention to my surroundings.</p>

<p align=left>"I did it!" he muttered, astonished. "It worked! Thank the Avatar and all the Virtues, thou hath been saved. "With his eyes still red with anguish, then tears of relief, he looked at me. He looked me over for injury and finding none, seemed to marvel at me.</p>

<p align=left>Then, a long stare. He seemed to gaze much too long at me, into my borrowed eyes. Eyes are tricky to control and match movements with, but I thought I had done well. Still, I wondered briefly if he could tell...and he was still staring. </p>

<p align=left>"I'm sorry," he said suddenly. "I don't know where me manners are. Let meget us some water and stew." </p>

<p align=left>"Excellent" I thought. "I have succeeded for now." My next test would be forthcoming. Eating and drinking required extraordinary control, and I had to manage this with some grace. I briefly wondered how I ever existed once as a mortal. Such outward flaws and weaknesses. At least they hindered my target as well. </p>

<p align=left>I had planned for this time. The Necromancers made sure the body had no wounds or organ damage. It must be able to hold food and liquid. I had planned also to feign disorientation and memory loss to better protect my ruse from question. He returned shortly thereafter with some stew and water, and I slowly propped up my body and sipped the water. Carefully, I used my right hand to drink with, as I had lost a nail on my left somehow. Cadavers can be frail at times. Hiding my left-hand fingers in my clothing, I finished eating. </p>

<p align=left>Now came the talking. One more exercise to perform. "How...how did you save me?" I sputtered as meekly as I could. "I was killed. My stomach." "I tried to cast Resurrection for you, but 'tis truly the work of the Avatar that ye are here breathing now." He declared. </p>

<p align=left>Breathing? I hadn't considered that aspect. I had better see to that.</p>

<p align=left>With a long, practice breath I said, "So I was dead, and you brought me back? Your Avatar?" </p>

<p align=left>"Aye," he said and smiled. "You are fine now."</p>

<p align=left>"But ye don't even know me. Why?" </p>

<p align=left>"'Tis no matter that I don't know ye. You are a human being, and worthy of me help."</p>

<p align=left>Suppressing a smile, I went on, "You don't know me, so you don't know about my life." </p>

<p align=left>"Tell me then, what do ye like to do?" His face was cheerful and bright. I forced a serious look on myself, then continued, "I would like to finally rest from all the dying and pain and suffering. These things hath been my life." </p>

<p align=left>His smile ran away like a child from a ghost. "What? Surely you must jest?"</p>

<p align=left>"I hath seen my parents killed by orcs. My brother Allec was torn apart by a troll. John drowned at sea. There is nothing for me."</p>

<p align=left>"But you must have faith and keep fighting on, lass." His words sounded genuine. </p>

<p align=left>"I did. I moved away from my village and strove to be a healer to help those fighting monsters. Helping men kill those beasts was my revenge. I even met my husband there. We were wed there." </p>

<p align=left>"Well there, you see? Things got better when you set your self to it. I am sorry about your family though. The Avatar and all things good come to those who strive for the Virtues." </p>

<p align=left>All according to plan. "So I thought, until My husband was killed fighting orcs, and most of our outpost burned to the ground. Many of us healers were killed. We were totally unarmed. We ran and ran. Finally, we reached the shore near here." Since tears were not an option with zombies, I gave a despondent stare. "We were too exhausted to continue, and the orcs caught
up to us. Their mages were intent on casting their spells on the healers, but none of the others. The others were killed on the beach. As if they wanted to see how much we could take, they hurled bolt after bolt of magic at us."</p>

<p align=left>His mood fell, his eyes low. I had left him little good to point to. After a long moment of awkward silence, he spoke. "Aye but it is obvious now how badly ye hath suffered, but would ye be better off like I found ye? Now you can begin anew."</p>

<p align=left>"I would indeed be better off dead. As I was dying on the shore, I at last knew that I would have peace forever. I would leave this hateful place of torment and loss. Ye did not mean it, but your Avatar hath wronged me for this."</p>

<p align=left>Enosh thought hard on this. At first he clung to his beliefs. He knew how it could be following the Virtues. Goodness, peace, happiness. His fellow LOA brethren were his family, and good to him they were. However, he could not help but remember the recent time of pain for him. Try as he might, the images came back, seeping through the cracks in his mind's wall. Images of
his fine ships sinking....months of work and toil gone. Thoughts of being marooned for days. He thought he had been forsaken, never to return. His friends and comrades came for him, but would they not have if there were no guild nor Virtue? Do not evil men still have companions? Do orcs? His grasp of his beliefs shook a little, and he dropped his head into his hands to hide from the world a moment. He must try and shut out such painful thoughts.</p>

<p align=left>His mixed emotions were strong, and I fed from them like no food could do. It had begun. The Shades had planted the seeds of doubt in his mind on that island, and the Death Knights had ensured that he would be mine alone while I began his undoing. Leaving a blank stare on the Necromancer's host cadaver, I shifted into the Ether to give report to the Wraithlord. ~~All is according to plan~~</p>

<p align=left>A smile would have crossed the Wraithlord's face if he had one, but the only smile was the High Necromancer's as the news was passed along. Soon, the Captain would be psychologically weakened enough to proceed with the next step of the plan...</p>
