<blockquote>
<p align=left>I am feeling so sad as I write this. My time with my golden one was so short this eve. This was party because I arrived late and partly from business he needed to attend to.</p>

<p align=left>He was in North Freeport when I arrived so I made my food and water, cast Center and Holy armor on myself, and buffed and healed people at the zone. I decided to do some practice for our return home. I began casting Invisibility vs Undead to bring up my Divination. I fizzled so much but kept on practicing. </p>

<p align=left>Finally he arrived while I was meditating. He told me the most wonderful news. He had gained enough knowledge to learn some new and more powerful spells. He looked so proud. I asked him to explain these new spells and his face lit up as he described how he could protect others and the power of his destructive spells. Ya could hear the excitement in his voice. </p>

<p align=left>He had cast his protective spell upon a passing enchanter who in turn cast clarity upon me. He told me to take this opportunity while I could and keep on practicing my skill. To make it fun, I casted invisibility vs. undead on him. I was doing quite well until he said 'OK time for a test'. He then went on to say if I did not fizzle on 7 out of 10 casts then the practice for me was over. Well, wouldn't ya know it I fizzled on 8 out of 10 casts. I just had to laugh and told him that he jinxed me! He was trying so hard not to laugh. He told me it was enough of that for this eve but I should work on raising it to be above 50 over he next few days. It is very important that I raise this skill else I will surely die in Unrest. </p>

<p align=left>Then began my instruction on Divine Aura. It should be used when soloing as a way to escape. He reminded me that when ya too low in health ya begin to move slowly and if ya wait to cast DA until then ya may not be able to escape if ya have far to go. So it is important to cast it when ya still strong enough to run but the battle is going poorly. Since I had died so often in the past few days I asked him how would I know it's the right time. I then said to him that Dearg called me stubborn so I obviously didn't know when the correct time to run is. He said that I was not stubborn rather too eager to advance. He then explained that the time to worry was when I reach two bubble and the creature had more health than me. Then it was time to actually use it. I had to cringe at this so he told me to go out and fetch something that I could already handle. As I was running about he went on to say that Divine Aura grants ya a limited time of protection and there is still the chance that I will be stunned so it is important to use it while I could still run. Just what I needed to hear. ..</p>

<p align=left>Off I went and found a ghoul and brought it back to where he was standing. He told me not to hit it rather wait until I was at half health. The ghoul pounding me he said don't run. Well, the dern thing rooted me so that solved that problem. My feet finally free and a little less than half health I cast Divine Aura. I was surprised at it's fast casting time. I ran as fast as my little feet could take me to the zone area. He told me to come back and he healed me while I did away with the ghoul. I was going to ask him about the spell being interrupted but then he called me back to sit with him as someone was communicating with him about some business he had to attend to. He asked me to accompany him while he attended his business, which I did.</p>

<p align=left>I did not fully understand all that was going on but watched my golden one … always careful in his word and so dignified in his manner. He was so tired before we left and looked even more so then, but being who he is concerned with the welfare of others he wanted to be sure the matter at hand was taken care of. </p>

<p align=left>His business over he asked me to walk with him a bit. He told me that we may not have a lesson tomorrow and would have to see what the day brought us. We said our good bye and I wished him sweet dreams. Before he left he said that he would because he was wearing the ring I had given him while he sleeps. </p>

<p align=left>I am so proud of him attaining his new spells but then I am so sad, since it will be that much longer before I can stand beside him in battle. Enough thought of that. It is time I rest also. </p>
