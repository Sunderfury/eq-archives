<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">Chances are that you might have hit ALT-Enter... both keys at the same time when UO was running. Doing this will change not the resolution of only UO but also the resolution your monitor is set at. It will take it to 640x480 resolution and chances are you don't normally run your computer at this resolution so your monitor hasn't been adjusted quite right for it. If when you start up UO your monitor goes black for a second and then the UO screen fills your entire picture, that is probably what happened.<p>You can't see the text at the bottom of your monitor because your screen size is set to large for that resolution on your monitor... blah blah blah! *giggles* I'm not sure if I even understood that... but all you have to do is shrink your screensize down. Then you should be able to see your text at the bottom of the screen. You can do that with the controls on your monitor itself - there should be buttons (sometimes knobs) to adjust the size of the displayed picture and it's position on the screen. I'll bet if you reduce the vertical size of your picture you'll be able to see your text as you type it again. ---Don't make the adjustments until UO is running. Don't worry about messing up your display becuase your monitor will "remember" the settings for your other resolution and go back to them when you quit UO. <p>Forget all this stuff I just yapped about and don't mess with the full-screen UO settings if you want to run UO with the black border... but it's nice to have your monitor ready for the lower resolution if you ever want to run UO at full screen. In fact, I've found that UO actually runs a little better at fullscreen but it's usually not a big difference (unless you have an older computer) and I like to have my healthbar and all my other junk out of the way of the game screen.<p>Next time you start up UO, once it's loaded, hit ALT and Enter at the same time... that should take you back to the game screen size you were at before and your black border should come back once you log in.<p>I hope that helps out!<p>Spice</font>
