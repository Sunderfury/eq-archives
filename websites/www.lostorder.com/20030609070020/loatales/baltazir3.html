<p align=left><b>Vision of the Mage</b><br><i>by Baltazir</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It was a fitful night's sleep for the young Magi. The room and bed he had for the night was far from comfortable. As he slept, Baltazir dreamt of that day's battles...of lugian and drudges and shreths. He recalled the painful deaths he had endured. He recalled the dizzy feeling one experiences after one's soul returns to the body at a lifestone. And he dreamt of growing stronger in his skills and of revenge against the dreaded lugian.</p>

<p align=left>Sometime between mid of night and day's first light his sleep quieted. It was then that young Baltazir had a vision. In his vision he was approached by an old and wizened mage. He did not know who it was, but he felt at peace. The mage smiled and said "The life of the magi is long young one. We do not rush through as others do. Our lives span many lifetimes." In his mind, Baltazir questioned "But sire, there is much evil in the world. There is much to do to rid Dereth of the foul and vile." The ancient mage smiled yet again "Ahhh, the spirit of the youth. Once young Baltazir I was as you are...ready to do in a day what will take many lifetimes to accomplish. You are young and your powers are weak...but they are growing. Do not burn yourself out in a flash. Learn and grow and be ready to support your fellows in this noble task of vanquishing evil." At this point in the vision, the elder mage leaned forward and placed his fingertips on Baltazir's temple. Baltazir felt immense peace as the weariness drained from his body. "I give you a valuable lesson young mage. I put within you the ability to sleep as the magi do...to sleep and restore one's karma for the long road we travel. With this we are able to live longer than most mortals. Do not forget..."</p>

<p align=left>As Baltazir slipped away from the vision and into the sleep of the magi, he saw the ancient mage conjure a spell around the room...a spell that would seal him away from the outside until he would wake. His breathing then slowed, to near stop. His heart slowed, and he knew no more of the lands of Dereth...</p>
