<p align=left>Captain's Log: Wintersebb 28</p>

<p align=left>Today has been a very long day!  Though I must say it has also been a very
profitable day fer me.</p>

<p align=left>I awoke this mornin' to find Selfora already hard at work downstairs in the
pub.  This gave me the chance to grab all me adventurin' gear and escape out
the balcony.  While I very much enjoyed allowin' her to play nurse maid to
me (hello nurse) I was itchin' to head back out and scower the lost
distillary again fer those rumored vintages.</p>

<p align=left>You know in me time here, which is goin' on a full month now, I don't think
I've seen the sun but once in me entire stay.  I truely do like this fair
city, but the gods do like to rain on it I find.  Still I braved the cold
winter's wind and rain and headed back to the underground distillery's
entrance.</p>

<p align=left>Once again I found my self, dropin' drudges and spliting shreths left and
right.  I even made it so far as to find the confounded drudge prowler that
was combing the depths.  This time I got me revenge and fed him a quiver
full of arrows.  Low and behold, ye know what he was guarding?  Well I'll
tell ye, it was the distillery nectar itself!  I managed to grab two bottles
of the stuff and haul my sorry carcas clean away.</p>

<p align=left>I figure I can give one bottle to sweet Selfora, since she's got a rather
exotic taste in beverages.  And the other I can keep fer meself.  Perhaps
tomorrow I shall head back down there and look for more of the good stuff.</p>
