<p align=left><b>Charity</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It took Santiago a moment to realize that the dull booming noise was not coming from inside his own skull. He gazed around dully at the high walls of the great hall, and wondered what could be making such a racket.</p>

<p align=left>“Sounds like it’s comin’ from the entrance,” he mumbled. Then his eyes widened. “Blimey! Maybe we’re under attack!”</p>

<p align=left>Gripping his two-handed quarterstaff, he wished for the hundredth time that the monks had not confiscated his trusty old sword. Apparently, clerics weren’t allowed to use edged weapons (how they carved up their meat was still a mystery to him). So now he was forced to use this ridiculously thin wooden pole to crack skulls open. “Why do they call it a quarterstaff, anyways? If this is only a quarter of it, figger only a giant could wield the whole thing!”</p>

<p align=left>He advanced cautiously down the hallway until he reached the massive stone doors. With a great heave, he threw them open and stood ready to beat his foes unconscious.</p>

<p align=left>For their part, the poor beggars at the door were somewhat surprised when their knocking was at last answered by a monk who charged at them with a wild battle cry.</p>

<p align=left>“Mercy, sir, I beg ye!” said the elder pauper, holding his hands feebly in the air to ward off the impending assault. “We ain’t here to fight!”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago stopped short and looked disappointed. “No? Then what do ye want?”</p>

<p align=left>The beggars held their hands out in a gesture of supplication. “We are poor fellows, good sir. We were hoping for a bit of food, or perhaps a few coins to see us through the cold winter.”</p>

<p align=left>“The only thing ye’ll get from me is a swift kick in the arse, if ye don’t get yer mangy hides out o’ me sight!” Santiago shook his quarterstaff at them.</p>

<p align=left>“Santiago!” bellowed a voice from behind him. Santiago turned and saw Brother Jacob standing at the abbey doors, his arms crossed and his face darkened in a scowl of disapproval.</p>

<p align=left>“What?” Santiago snapped irritably.</p>

<p align=left>“This is not the way we treat poor souls in need,” said Jacob. His frown dissipated into a warm smile, and he approached the two urchins. “Good sirs, won’t you please come inside and have some food?” The strangers accepted, and the three of them entered the abbey, leaving a bewildered Santiago outside.</p>

<p align=left>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p align=left>“Yer makin’ a mistake, I tell ye!”</p>

<p align=left>Jacob gritted his teeth and forced himself to be patient. “Santiago, we are monks. Do you know what that means?”</p>

<p align=left>“It means we’re stupid?”</p>

<p align=left>Jacob’s right hand started to tremble and curl into a fist. “No, it means that we are kind, and compassionate, and that we welcome all needy souls into our abbey, sharing with them what little we have.”</p>

<p align=left>“But they’re thieves, I tell ye! They’ll eat up all our food, an’ make off with our gold!”</p>

<p align=left>Jacob sighed. “Not everyone in the world is a thief, Santiago. You must learn to trust others, as you would trust yourself. Only then can you truly understand what Compassion is.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago threw his hands in the air. “Awright. Fine. Ye win. Give ‘em all yer gold. See if I give a darn.”</p>

<p align=left>Jacob smiled gently. “It’s called Charity, Santiago. Watch and learn…you might be surprised.”</p>

<p align=left>The beggars were soon done with their meal, and the priest handed them a large sack which produced a telltale jingle of coins. “Good sirs, please accept this gift from us. Use this money to purchase food, clothing and shelter, so that the winter will not seem as harsh. We ask nothing in return, save that you show others the same kindness if you are ever able to do so.”</p>

<p align=left>The elder pauper stared wide-eyed at the bag, and grabbed it. “Wow, dude, you were right…these monks is stupid.”</p>

<p align=left>“Yeah. Hehehehe. Told ya. Let’s go drop this loot off at our castle.”</p>

<p align=left>“Ok.” The ‘beggar’ waved his arms, and a shimmering blue portal appeared. The thieves made rude gestures at the two monks, and then disappeared into the azure light.</p>

<p align=left>Jacob bit his lip and then looked at Santiago, who was smiling widely. “Don’t say a word,” warned Jacob. “Not a goddamn word.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago raised his hands and said nothing. He watched as Jacob stormed off into the chapel, slamming the door behind him. Then the former pirate collapsed, rolling around on the floor and laughing.</p>

<p align=left>“So much for Charity,” he cried.</p>
