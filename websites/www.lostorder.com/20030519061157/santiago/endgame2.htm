<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You have enough
food and water?&quot; asked Bolgar.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk smiled. His
little brother&#146;s voice was gruff, but he could sense his sorrow.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Yes. I will be
fine, Bolgar.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;So you say.
What if you never return? What if you die chasing after this &#145;vision&#146;, or
whatever it is?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Then I shall
die,&quot; said Greyhawk. He turned and looked into the worried face of his brother.
&quot;Bolgar, you do not understand why I chose the way of the Shaman, do you?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bolgar shook his
head. &quot;Because you are crazy?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk laughed.
&quot;Aye, perhaps. I would like to think otherwise.&quot; He sighed, and looked across
the dark lake. &quot;Most men live their lives in darkness,&quot; he said. &quot;They
never know where they are going, nor where they have been. They never truly see the world
around them.&quot; He glanced at his brother. &quot;I do not wish to live in such
blindness. I cannot. In choosing to follow the path of the spirits, I am following my own
heart.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bolgar nodded.
&quot;I still think you are crazy.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Then wish your
crazy brother luck, for here comes the raft,&quot; Greyhawk smiled, and embraced his
brother. &quot;Farewell, Bolgar. May the Ancestors watch over you, and keep you from
harm.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Farewell,
Greyhawk. Safe journey.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk stepped onto
the raft. &quot;I shall return,&quot; he said, smiling. &quot;The spirits have told me
so.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well, the
spirits had better be right,&quot; said Bolgar.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The raft began to
drift out into the lake. Bolgar watched as it carried his brother off into the darkness.</font></font><font size="5"></p>

strode through the familiar icy canyons with a light heart. To outsiders, the paths of
Everfrost were an incomprehensible labyrinth. Occasionally, the morning hunting parties
would discover the bodies of outsiders who had gotten lost, and either froze to death or
got attacked by wolves, or both. Everfrost was not a place for the unwary, nor for those
who have no sense of direction.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The young warriors
were gathered, as usual, outside the main entrance to Halas. Several of them ran up to
him, asking if he would like to accompany them for a hunt. He smiled and shook his head.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I am going on a
journey,&quot; he said.</font></font></p>
