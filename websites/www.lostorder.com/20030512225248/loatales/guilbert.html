<p align=left><b>A Letter Home</b><br><i>by Guilbert</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>HarvestGrain 30, Portal Year 11</p>

<p align=left>My dear Catherine,</p>

<p align=left>How strange would the date above seem if you could read these words now? You would, like me, put this parchment down and rub your eyes before looking again. And you might, like me, have to wipe a tear from the page. After all, the date would seem as foreign to you as would this land, were you here. And you would feel, as I do, the unimaginable distance, the infinite gulf between us now. </p>

<p align=left>I feel silly, a bit, dear sister. To write this letter when I know that you can probably never read it would be called daft by some, our old teacher Mieran most of all. But I have wished for a chance to speak with you for weeks, since I was drawn through that shimmering portal down by Helling's Brook. And since I am now convinced that I am not to see you again soon, I will do what I can to give voice to my heart's ache.</p>

<p align=left>Helling's Brook. How many afternoons did we spend there as children? How we played in that stream until the mud covered us to our knees, and our chests hurt from the laughing! I cry now to think of how I scared you during your eighth summer when I held you under that cool, clear water. At the time, I dismissed your sobs as childish, and even cursed your name when I felt Father's rod for my crime. But, as I think on it now, I remember my regret. As soon as I saw your face breaking the surface, eyes like saucers, choking and gasping for air, I felt regret. Catherine, you were the most beautiful flower in a garden full of lovely souls. For Helling's Brook, and a dozen other thoughtless moments that caused you distress, I will neverfully atone.</p>

<p align=left>But besides our fun at the stream's edge, the memory that I have of Helling's Brook, hazy though it is, is of an afternoon three months ago. As I stood down by the brook with Pappus (worthless, lovable hound), I had the feeling of being watched. An unfounded embarrassment at being observed, and a twinge of danger made me turn on my heel to face my observer. I remember thinking I should scold the dog for not warning of this person's approach. </p>

<p align=left>But when I turned, there was no person there at all, only a swirling, glowing, purple whirlpool in the air, almost as tall as a man. It was enchanting, and it made a sound like wind in faraway birch branches. (Why had I not heard it before, dear sister?) I somehow tore my eyes away from it, and looked down at Pappus, who had wandered a couple of yards away and was nosing through a pile of leaves, as if this strange thing were not right before us both, bizarre and distracting.</p>

<p align=left>Instead of scolding him, though, I looked back to the thing. The sound of wind now seemed more a sucking sound. Do you remember the cave in the hills near Uncle Dathrin's house? That sound of air rushing into the earth, to only the gods know where? Somewhere, in the back of my brain, I'm sure the sound reminded me of that, but my mind wasn't clear, and before I knew what I was doing, and without looking back at Pappus, I had stepped into that strange light.</p>

<p align=left>I remember nothing of what happened then. If it is like travelling through the portals on this world, it is vaguely like a sensation of falling through a gray, shimmering tunnel that curves this way and that while purple lights float by. This first time, though, I felt and saw nothing. Instead, I woke as if from a long, peaceful sleep.</p>

<p align=left>When I woke, but before I opened my eyes, I remember thanking the gods for such a refreshing night's slumber. But when I opened my eyes and found myself lying on a lush, green hillside, I nearly screamed from the shock of it. Like a fool, I turned around looking for my dear hound. And something about the butterfly that winged its way past me told me I was not near home. Through the trees, I could see the spires of some nearby cathedral or temple, and I made my way toward them.</p>

<p align=left>Beloved sister, I have not slept the same since then, and I have never needed restful nights more in my life. 
This world is home to so many tragic stories that to hear them would rend your soft, innocent heart. But there are people here who do what they can to root out Dereth's evil.</p>

<p align=left>I near the end of this scroll, sweet Catherine, and so I will put down my pen and dream, if I am lucky, that you are in the hall of our house, with Mother and Father, reading this letter. And in my dream, I pray that you will be smiling and sure in your hearts that I am well and that I long for you with all my soul.</p>

<p align=left>With all my love, I sign this,<br>
Guilbert</p>
