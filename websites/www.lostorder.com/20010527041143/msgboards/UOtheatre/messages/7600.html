: Just found these lyrics. They made me think.

: Everlast Lyrics - What Its Like

: We've all seen a man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
: The hair on his face is dirty, dread-locked, and full of mange
: He asks a man for what he could spare, with shame in his eyes
: &quot;Get a job you fucking slob,&quot; is all he replies
: God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
: 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues

: Chorus
: Then you really might know what it's like...
: Then you really might know what it's like...
: Then you really might know what it's like...
: Then you really might know what it's like...

: Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom that said he was in love
: He said, &quot;Don't worry about a thing, baby doll
: I'm the man you've been dreaming of.&quot;
: But 3 months later he say he won't date her or return her calls
: And she swear, &quot;God damn, if I find that man I'm cuttin' off his balls.&quot;
: And then she heads for the clinic and
: She gets some static walking through the door
: They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner
: And they call her a whore
: God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
: 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose

: Chorus

: I've seen a rich man beg
: I've seen a good man sin
: I've seen a tough man cry
: I've seen a loser win
: And a sad man grin
: I heard an honest man lie
: I've seen the good side of bad
: And the downside of up
: And everything between
: I licked the silver spoon
: Drank from the golden cup
: And smoked the finest green
: I stroked the fattest dimes at least a couple of times
: Before i broke their heart
: You know where it ends, yo, it usually depends on where you start

: I knew this kid named Max
: Who used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
: He liked to hang out late
: he liked to get shit-faced and keep the pace with thugs
: Until late one night there was a big old fight and Max lost his head
: He pulled out his chrome .45, talked some shit, and wound up dead
: Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of this pain
: You know it comes that way
: At least that's what they say when you play the game
: God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
: 'Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose 
: Then you really might know what it's like...
: Then you really might know what it's like...
: Then you really might know what it's like...to have to lose
