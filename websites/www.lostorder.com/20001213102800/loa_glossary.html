      face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">The official title granted to the first group of
      people who were involved in the birth of the LOA. This title is often abbreviated in chat
      room nicknames and/or posts by using the following suffix: [f] Founders have a major say
      in the direction and overall goal of the Lost Order of Akalabeth. Each Founder is given a
      seat on the Grand Council of the LOA. Founders who are inactive are asked to reserve their
      votes, due to being uninformed about the current issues. The very first founders were
      Brimstone and Freejack. More information about the &quot;birth&quot; of LOA can be found
      on our site. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF8080"><strong>Grand Council: </strong></font><font
      face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">The Grand Council is the highest governing body of
      the LOA. It consists of all the Founders, as well as the Chapter Leaders. The Founders
      represent the original goals and ideas of LOA, as well as the vision we set forth to
      establish so many years ago. The Chapter Leaders represent their chapter of members, as
      well as new ideas, new goals, policy updates, debates, etc. Together, high level decisions
      are discussed and voted upon. If an issue requires a 'Tie Breaker', Freejack and Brimstone
      reserve the right to make a final decision based on the feedback received, as well as the
      overall 'good of the guild</font>'. </p>
      <p><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF8080">High Council:</font></strong><font

      as well as a host of members responsible for units and/or tasks associated with the
      management of the chapter. Together, the Chapter Leader and official members of the
      management team for that chapter, make up the &quot;High Council&quot;. The High Council
      is responsible for game specific management issues and policies that must align themselves
      with the overall guild goals and direction. </font></p>

      central, guildwide meetings that are hosted every Wednesday night, as well as in times of
      emergency or importance. During our meetings, we formally address the guild members using
      roleplaying elements such as a podium, seating and more. Our speakers actually roleplaying
      their approach to the podium, as well as other atmospherical things taking place around
      them during the discussion. The Hall of Akalabeth is a &quot;Moderated&quot; chatroom in
      IRC, meaning that only authorized (Voiced) people can speak and have their text viewed by
      others. </font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF8080">Akalabeth:</font><font
      face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00"> </font></strong><font face="Verdana" size="2"
      color="#FEB36D">Richard Garriot, creator of Ultima Online and the previous Ultima series,
      was inspired by the Tolkien story entitled, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Within this story, the
      name &quot;Aklabeth&quot; was used. Richard Garriot used that name for the title of his
      first CRPG called, &quot;Akalabeth&quot;. This game earned Richard enough exposure in the
      gaming industry that it launched his career and gave birth to Ultima. When looking for a
      name for our guild, we wanted something that would catch the attention of Richard Garriot
      (as well as Origin), and we also wanted a name that would attract die-hard fans of the
      Ultima series. Thus, &quot;Akalabeth&quot; was chosen as a portion of our name. </font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF8080">The Lost Order of:</font></strong><font
      face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D"> If you have already read the description of the
      term, &quot;Akalabeth&quot;, as it applies to us -- then I can easily explain why we
      added, &quot;The Lost Order of&quot; to our name. With the game Akalabeth being so
      ancient, we wanted to make our guild appear to be a band of prophets and seers sent from
      the old world of &quot;Akalabeth&quot; -- to the new world of &quot;Sosaria&quot;. We felt
      that the complete name, &quot;Lost Order of Akalabeth&quot; would have an air of mystery
      and intrigue about it, thus appealing to fellow gamers and Ultima fans. The fact that we
      jumped from one world (Akalabeth) to another (Sosaria) opened the door to the possibility
      that our members had powerful magiks at their control (Roleplaying is SO fun!). This
      roleplay fact about our Order allowed us to easily explain how and why we were able to
      enter OTHER worlds (i.e. Norrath, Dereth, etc.) using the same name, &quot;LOA&quot;. </font></p>

      Akalabeth&quot;:</font></strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D"> Once an
      application is submitted, the applicant is thereby referred to as a &quot;Petitioner&quot;
      of the LOA. This phase consists of 7 days whereby the Full Members of LOA review the
      application submitted, discuss any issues they may have regarding the applicant, and
      finally vote whether to accept or deny the application. Petitioners require three votes of
      confidence for their application to make it to the next phase of membership which is
      entitled, &quot;The Initiate Phase&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF8080"><strong>Initiate, INIT or &quot;Initiate

      applicant has passed the Petitioner Phase (having received three votes of confidence),
      he/she becomes an Initiate. The Initiate Phase consists of 30 days where the applicant
      must spend time learning our rules/policies, meeting our members (both of that chapter and
      overall) and participating in our community (both ingame and out of game). As Initiates
      spend time posting on our forums, talking with us in the chat rooms and being involved
      with us &quot;in-game&quot;, they will become noticed by our members. Either a positive or
      negative impression will be made, and our Full Members will keep this in mind during our
      private voting. Full Members of LOA are encourage to vote at ANY TIME during the 30 days
      of the Initiation Phase. If the Initiate receives (6) or more votes during that time, they
      will progress to the final phase of the application process, also known as &quot;Commoner
      of Akalabeth&quot;. </font></p>
      <p><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FF8080">Commoner, CMNR or &quot;Commoner

      of Akalabeth&quot;. The Commoner Phase consists of 30 days, at which point, Full Members
      give a final vote of confidence on the applicant. Commoners must receive (8) or more votes
      to become a full member of the LOA. Commoners are highly respected and have usually proven
      their worthiness and maturity by this time. The Commoner Phase is more of a
      tradition/formality that prepares people for full membership. </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFF00"><strong>Voting System:</strong></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FEB36D">The voting system is fairly easy to use.
      It is a web-based application that requires a password and login ID to use (see your
      Chapter Lord/Lady of Initiation). Each Full Member has the option to vote on every single
      applicant throughout every phase. During the Petitioner Phase, Full Members can cast a
      vote either &quot;For&quot; or &quot;Against&quot; the applicant. During the Initiate and
      Commoner phases, our members are given a range of votes that they can use to judge an
      applicant, and they are: +1 [Exceptional], + [Good], 0 [No Opinion], - [Bad], -1
      [Horrible]. Only +1 votes are used to determine if someone will move on to the next phase.
      + votes are very positive and show us that an applicant is doing well and making progress
      within that Chapter. 0 votes simply mean that a given Full Member has not had an
      opportunity to meet with or form an opinion of a candidate. This vote does not hinder the
      applicant at all, unless it is an overwhelming number of '0' votes. The - vote simply
      means that a candidate has shown characteristics that are unbecoming. Either immature,
      uncaring, reckless, etc. Oftentimes we will notify a candidate that there are problems
      that need to be addressed. The -1 vote is the absolute worst vote a player can receive. -1
      votes negate +1 votes and send a clear message to the guild that this candidate has done
      something to really upset a member of the guild. The way our system works, a few -1 votes
      will not automatically remove someone from the guild. Instead, we will tally up the +1 and
      -1 votes and make a decision based on the overall perception of the candidate. We feel
      that this is a very fair system of checks and balances, ensuring that nobody will be
      ousted over one member who is upset. </font></p>
