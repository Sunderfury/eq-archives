<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">Nightfall
in Everfrost gives new meaning to the word &#145;cold&#146;. When the bitter wind howls
through the mountaintops, it is brutal and merciless, murdering all warmth.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Greyhawk heard the
wind, but it did not frighten him. He knew how long it would be before the sun went down,
and he knew that he would arrive at the shelter before then. He knew how to build a warm
campfire, and he knew that he would survive this winter night.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">What worried him was
the vision. What did it mean? Never-ending night. For a moment, he wondered if Bolgar was
right. What if it was a false vision, one that would lead him to doom? But no, the spirits
had never once lied to him. But what was he to do? Where was he to go?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He stopped to rest
for a moment. Far below, he saw a giant woolly mammoth trudge through the valley. Even
from way up here, he could hear its mighty footsteps. He closed his eyes, and listened to
the sound. After the mammoth had gone, there was only the wind.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">His people had lived
in Everfrost for many, many years. His father&#146;s father&#146;s father had perhaps
walked these very mountains, once. And though they were long dead, it is said that their
spirits still wander the earth, still watching over their children. Were the ghosts of his
ancestors watching him now? Was it their ghostly voices he heard in the howling wind?</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">How he wished that
they could guide him now, for he did not know what to do. What he needed was a sign. But
there were no signs, no instructions. There was only the wind.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He opened his eyes
and gazed out across the icy landscape. Was that a fire he saw, in the distance?</font></font></p>
