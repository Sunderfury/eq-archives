<p align=left><b>The Book</b><br><i>by Atlantia</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The Blood Queen's mood was as dark as the night around her. A frown descended upon her eloquent features as she entered the Capitol Township. Atlantia hated this city. This place is nothing but a cesspool now, she thought to herself as lead her horse through the over crowded, poorly lit, narrow streets. She watched with disdain as a filthy, little, cutpurse attempted to relieve some nameless noble of his money pouch. Justice came swift and sure as the royal guards were called and the perpetrator was dispatched. If only the collector was as efficient at disposing of the body. It would be hours yet before the 'death wagon' was brought to gather up the remains. Thus is life in Britian, den of thieves, haven of harlots, and home of the honorable Lord British. Atlantia shook her head in disgust and reigned her horse to a halt outside the door of a seedy looking establishment. A passed-out drunken sailor lay face down in the dirt to the left of the tavern (at least she assumed he was passed-out), while two street urchins searched his pockets for anything of value. She had arrived. This was the Cat's Lair, most frequented and popular tavern in all the city. Barely aware of her actions Atlantia wrapped the reigns around the hitching post and patted her mount on the muzzle. Magic was a fine horse, strong and obedient, loyal beyond question. It was hardly necessary to fetter him at all. He would remain where his mistress left him until Hades froze over without restraint, however, it is customary to confine your beasts within the city limits so the woman complied. With a final look over her shoulder (some habits never die) she entered the tavern. </p>

<p align=left>The warrior woman's eyes naturally narrowed as they adjusted to the dimly lit, smoke filled room. Walking to the bar she ordered a red wine and slowly turned to survey the other patrons of the bar. An obnoxious drunken lout with a rusty longsword was leering hungrily at a barmaid from the far end of the bar… a joke. A young couple hid off in a corner, whispering sweet nothings to each other and holding hands under the table…how cute. A bleary eyed sailor with an ale in each hand and a buxom blonde on his lap…lucky guy. A group of five well dressed, heavily armed, militia men playing cards and drinking at the center table…a possible. Beside the fire a dark skinned young bard strummed lovingly on a lute dreamy eyed and smiling, while a grizzled old, gray haired veteran with a long white beard snoozed beside him in an over stuffed chair…no threat there.</p>
 
<p align="left">The one she sought sat alone at a table, fiddling nervously with her napkin and looking very out of place. Lady Clementine was a beautiful young woman with delicate features and soft blue eyes that belied the strength of her well-conditioned body. Her azure tresses hung almost to her waist and she wore her locks loose and flowing free of a binding cord. Her magnificent mane was the envy of many a your female. Atlantia smiled. Though it was obvious to herself that the woman had attempted to dress casually, the Lady's taste in clothing and sense of fashion made her stand out like a rose in the middle of a dandelion field. Satisfied that she had not been followed and that the room was safe, for the time being. Atlantia crossed the room to her table. The Lady immediately rose and graced the older woman with a perfectly executed curtsey. Still on bended knee Clementine stammered… "My Queen...I…I…did not…see you come in. Please forgive my rudeness." </p>

<p align=left>Atlantia smiled warmly at the woman's greeting and took her hand to help her to her feet.</p>

<p align=left>"Clementine you have been my vessel for well over a century now. Will you never dispense with these formal pleasantries?" The vampiress could not help but laugh at the look of utter disbelief on the young woman's face. She tried again… "Surly you see child, that in the eyes of mortal society, it is I, who should be bowing to you." </p>

<p align=left>The poor girl paled as though Atlantia had just stabbed her through the heart with a poisoned dagger. "Never, mistress! Though you 'choose' to no longer rule the Sabbat, you are still MY queen and always shall be. Please do not joke about such things!" Not wishing to cause the child further distress Atlantia gave up. </p>

<p align=left>"Very well Clem, call me what you will. I have no wish to upset you. Perhaps within the next century you will learn my name and someday use it." Atlantia grinned and motioned for the other woman to sit down. Once seated Lady Clementine seemed more at ease and quite anxious to speak. </p>

<p align=left>" I took the liberty of ordering for you, mistress…roast beef 'rare.' I was afraid to request it raw as the sight of a woman eating raw meat tends to disturb humans." She frowned. " I hope that is alright, my Queen." Again the girl searched the older woman's face for approval. </p>

<p align=left>"Tis fine Clementine. I am finally acquiring a taste for flesh, now that I force myself to eat it. It can actually be quite satisfying if consumed in moderation…" and washed down with a lot of fresh blood, Atlantia thought to herself.</p>

<p align=left>Clementine's face brightened visibly. "Oh my Queen, that is wonderful news. Surly this must mean you are making progress. Mayhap soon the 'thirst' will no longer control thee if you can appease thine appetite with food. Just think my Queen, with every morsel you consume, you take one more step on the path to Golconda." The girl was practically beaming now. Atlantia had not the heart to tell her that she still yearned for the bitter sweet taste of blood every single night. Or that, only by calling upon the power of the Avatar and all the virtues to give her strength, did she have the willpower not to commit murder to get it. She simply nodded and replied…</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, mayhap." </p>

<p align=left>The waitress brought the food and the two ladies ate quietly together as they talked. "So Clem, you have the book? And have read it?" Atlantia asked between bits of beef.</p>

<p align=left>Clementine's eyes grew dark and her tone serious. "Yes, my Queen. Thanks to Asabiya I have it right here." The Lady reached into a bag at her feet and pulled out a very ancient looking manuscript. She placed it on the table in front of Atlantia. </p>

<p align=left>The Blood Queen fingered the insignia of gold on the front cover before asking…"My guardian met with no resistance while procuring it I assume?" Though she formed it in the phrase of a question Atlantia had no doubt that it was a statement of fact. She knew first hand of the former Assamite's wraith-like stealth abilities. Even now after decades of her employ, Atlantia still marveled at the ease in which the woman could infiltrate and enemy's defenses. </p>

<p align=left>Clementine smiled, "None, apparently she walked right into Golgotha and took it right from under their very noses." Dabbing the corner of her heart shaped with mouth with her napkin, she continued. "According to what Asabiya told me of its keeping, I do not think the Ebon Skull realize the significance of this tome. I doubt the fools have even noticed it is missing." </p>

<p align=left>Atlantia smiled but she knew it best not to under estimate the dark ones. The Order of the Ebon Skull was not made up of fools and things are seldom as they appear. It all sounded to easy and was not to her liking. "Good. I want it returned immediately. You have copied all the relevant passages?" Clementine nodded and Atlantia continued.</p>

<p align="left">"Then give it to Asabiya this eve. I want it back in Golgotha before dawn. It is of the utmost importance that the book's disappearance IF discovered, is never traced back to me." Atlantia skimmed through the tome's yellowed pages briefly before handing it back to Clementine. </p>

<p align=left>"I understand, my Queen. It shall be done," said Clementine as she returned the journal to her bag. </p>

<p align=left>The Blood Queen's brow furled and her voice became soft and serious as she said. "So is it as we suspect? Tell me what you have read, what you have learned." Clementine sat her goblet down and leaned close, her voice barely a whisper as she spoke.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, my Queen. The book is written in his own hand and tells the story of his life and of the countless centuries of his existence. He tells of the curse, and of his fight for control, against the beast within. There are pages upon pages written of the children he sired and how they died by his hand…but most importantly, my Queen…is the story of his creation." With a trembling hand Clementine reached for her goblet and drank deeply of the wine before continuing. "He was not embraced, my Queen. He has no sire. He is truly one of the Damned. Lord Yarp is…is…of the Divine." The Lady fell silent letting the enormity of her words linger. When next she spoke she was near frantic. "Don't you see what this means, my Queen? Lord Yarp is truly cursed, the scroll did not work for him…but you were not damned by the gods, in that way. You were embraced by another kindred, the scroll may still work for you, mistress! It may work for you!" </p>

<p align=left>The words replayed over and over again in Atlantia's mind like the mantra of some Gregorian chant sung by a gaggle of monks. 'Lord Yarp is of the Divine.' So mesmerized by these words was the woman that she did not even notice when the drunken bum from the end of the bar stumbled off his bar stool and sauntered over to their table. Not until she heard his vulgar voice was the trance broken.</p>

<p align=left>"Hey little honeys! What are two fine fillies like you two doing eatin' alone? Why don't ya all come with me and I'll give ya both a ride you won't never fer'git!" Clementine's eyes grew wide in horror as she watched the man make disgusting pelvic thrusts in her direction. Atlantia's face remained a mask of stone. </p>

<p align=left>Red faced and still grunting like a pig, the man dropped his sweaty bulk into the seat next to the warrior woman and slung a tree trunk-like arm across the back of her chair. Leering like a fiend, the man leaned over and gave the ladies a nauseating smile made more so do to the numerous missing teeth. Faster than the man could draw breath the Blood Queen grabbed the two pronged meat fork from the table and slid it smartly between his nostrils. Tugging slightly she brought the drunkard's puffy red face even with her own and smiled sweetly exposing pearly white fangs. In a voice barely audible she hissed…</p>

<p align=left>"The Lady is married, you swine. As for myself, when I seek pleasure I will take it with a MAN and not a foul mouthed, snot filled, waste of low life scum like you. Do you understand?" Tears began to roll down the big man's cheeks as the woman continued to stretch his nose like a child's piece of taffy. "Look at my eyes you sniveling cur!" she demanded. The man gazed into her face and fell to his knees pleading with tear filled eyes. Atlantia's own eyes became feral and her voice resonant as she called upon the vampiric discipline of dominance to emphasize her words. "You will never again speak to a lady in such a fashion. Do you understand? Say it!" </p>

<p align=left>Even through the mask of pain on the man's face his hypnotic state was clearly visible. His body relaxed and his voice was calm and shallow sounding. "Never again…never again speak to a lady. I understand." With a flick of the wrist Atlantia removed the utensil from the man's tortured and swollen nose leaving his nostrils still intact. With another subtle flick she sent the fork sailing over head imbedding it in the support beam behind the bar mere inches from the barkeep's shocked face. In a final act of fury, she kicked the man's rather rotund gut with a leather clad boot and sent him sprawling to the floor. No sooner did the fool hit the floor than he was crawling away from this she demon as fast as his hands and knees would carry him. Half way to the door, the man scrambled to his feet and ran crying out into the street. </p>

<p align=left>The tavern was silent as death and all eyes were upon this strange woman. Every person in the room was waiting to see what the green haired wench would do next. Atlantia dropped her hand to the katana at her side and slowly scanned each individual who remained in the bar. The air in the room grew tense and it seemed even the city outside was holding its breath. Then with a "devil may care" shrug, the woman grinned and hollered over her shoulder. "Barkeep! A clean fork if you please!"</p>
