<p align=left><b>walking forward looking back</b><br><i>by solf</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I walk these roads.</p>

<p align=left>My pack loaded on my back.</p>

<p align=left>My staff aids my step, as I scan the horizon for signs of danger.</p>

<p align=left>Strange how the mind can wander with such a mundane task as a long walk.</p>

<p align=left>Voices come and go as my eyes glaze over, entering a state of daydream while I remain cognicent enough to continue my journey.</p>

<p align=left>Voices from the past.. from different worlds, long ago.</p>

<p align=left>A man named Brimstone, and Freejack.</p>

<p align=left>Lochedahnan and Akira... A Keep.. my home.</p>

<p align=left>A clearing... buildings... Santiago, Stubby, Broog, Deathwish Dragon.</p>

<p align=left>Brewman, Hawkeye, Brigadier, and Kelsam.</p>

<p align=left>Names and voices of the past come and go, washing over me like a cleansing rain.</p>

<p align=left>Another world, another time... a more recent past.</p>

<p align=left>There's a marble city... and more voices.. images.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain and Azlana.</p>

<p align=left>Bagulan, Argil, and Waran...</p>

<p align=left>Penaden, and Wryliak...</p>

<p align=left>More voices of friends from long ago.</p>

<p align=left>Too many to focus on.</p>

<p align=left>With a start, I realise that I had not been paying attention to my steps, lost in the past.</p>

<p align=left>I bring myself back to the present and focus on those I now call my friends.</p>

<p align=left>Some have made the journeys with me from world to world.</p>

<p align=left>Some are new.. I can hear their voices as well.</p>

<p align=left>Enosh, Joxer, and Orion.</p>

<p align=left>Tasslehof, Kileyan, and Gwenn.</p>

<p align=left>I smile to myself as I approach my destination: The hamlet of Hebian-To, my home for now.</p>

<p align=left>I feel very fortunate to have had such an existance, moving from world to world.</p>

<p align=left>My life feels endless, and those I have called my friends have helped to shape who I am.</p>

<p align=left>Some call me reclusive, or mysterious.</p>

<p align=left>I have been called a lunatic, and a prophet.</p>

<p align=left>I have been known as a saviour and as a doombringer.</p>

<p align=left>I have had many names, some I've already forgotten.</p>

<p align=left>Now they just call me the solf.</p>

<p align=left>Less of a name, more of a word.</p>

<p align=left>A word meaning what I have become over the years and through the worlds.</p>

<p align=left>Perhaps I am Warped, a bit jaded from all I have seen and done.</p>

<p align=left>I like to think I am enlightened, educated, and better prepared for the next turn in the road.</p>

<p align=left>I suppose it is who you ask, my friends or my enemies, as to what is the meaning of my name.</p>

<p align=left>I enter the center of town, and the locals avoid me like the plague.</p>

<p align=left>They do not even know me, but they can tell that I am different.</p>

<p align=left>Different for better or worse, I do not know, but I continue as I always have.</p>

<p align=left>Waiting for the next fork in the road, I will do what I can in this world.</p>

<p align=left>I will move forward, and I will succeed, knowing that I shall always have my brothers and sisters by my side.</p>

<p align=left>I bow my head and silently thank all my friends, for helping to mold me into what I have become.</p>

<p align=left>My friends, brothers, and sisters. Past, present, and future.</p>

<p align=left>I look forward to see what the future holds.</p>

<p align=left>It is good to be me.</p>
