: My sweet druid,

: Ye said if I ever need to get word to ye to give a message to any passing druid and so I hope this makes it to ye.

: Ye have told me at times I am stubborn and this time I must admit ye are right.  I wanted to get just one more trooper and whilst I was just about to snare it an orc sharman came behind me and rooted me to the ground.   I did manage to live but barely and my injuries are too severe this time.

: A kind soul passing by helped me back to Halas where I am hold up in yer barbarian friend's home.  I await a healer, as these wounds are too great for my meager skills.

: I hope this note finds ye.

: Yer Azra
