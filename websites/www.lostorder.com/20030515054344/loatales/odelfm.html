<p align=left><b>Ode to Our Lady of Frivolous Merriment</b><br><i>by Orbison Windjammer</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>*picks up his mandolin and begins playing*</p>

<p align=left>Oh, wonderful Lady, hold your head high<br>
It breaks all our hearts to see that you cry</p>

<p align=left>Surely you know, you're the heart of this faction?<br>
You bring us all joy, with each little action.</p>

<p align=left>You work and you labor both night and day<br>
All for the love of the LOA</p>

<p align=left>And in spite of the trials you have to face<br>
You always come through with style and grace</p>

<p align=left>And never have doubt, that the things that you do<br>
Inspire so many to look up to you</p>

<p align=left>And rest assured, Lady, wherever you lead<br>
We will all follow, attending each need</p>

<p align=left>I speak for the guild, who all share this sentiment<br>
Bless you , our Lady of Frivolous Merriment</p>
