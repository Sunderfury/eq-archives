<p align=left><b>Wyndelle's Misadventures Prologue</b><br><i>by Wyll</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><i>I have been shown some incredibly disturbing news of late and would ask that if you can sacrifice your time that you meet me at the tavern in Ak'anon as soon as possible. I pray that Brell lends you his speed, for the need is great and I fear we don't have much time... <br><br>

- Wyll Walaryn</i></p>

<p align=left>So begins one of oddest tales in the history of the Lost Order of Akalabeth.</p>

<p align=left>The Walaryn clan had always been regarded as a bit different, a bit secretive... perhaps even a bit sinister. Nothing, however, could have prepared any of us for the whirlwind that was about to be unleashed.</p>

<p align=left>This is but one portion of the saga which would later come to be known as The Tales of Clan Walaryn...</p>
