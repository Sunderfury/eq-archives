<p align=left><b>Confessions</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>“Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned,” said the young woman. “It’s been three weeks since my last confession.”</p>

<p align=left>“Blimey!” exclaimed Santiago. “Three weeks? I reckon ye got a lot to spill!”</p>

<p align=left>“Father?” The woman sounded confused.</p>

<p align=left>“Yer sins…ye must have a lot to confess. Heck, if I had to list all the stuff I’d done wrong in the last three weeks, we’d be here all day!”</p>

<p align=left>“No, I actually don’t have that many,” she said. “Just one, in fact.”</p>

<p align=left>“One?! Well, I’ll say ye lead a cleaner life than me! But that’s true o’ most folks, I s’pose. Well, go ahead. What did ye do, tell a fib?”</p>

<p align=left>“Worse than that,” she said. “I’ve had impure thoughts…about a man.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago shrugged. “Well, ye can’t get blamed fer yer thoughts, milady. It’s only natural, to lust after a fella. It ain’t no sin ‘til ye actually lay hands on ‘im. Errr…ye ain’t laid hands on ‘im, have ye?”</p>

<p align=left>The woman sighed. “No, never. But I…I would like to, Father. Oh, I know that it’s wrong, but I can’t help it. I can’t stop thinking about him.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago sighed. “He must be a handsome fella, no?”</p>

<p align=left>“No, not really. He’s not ugly, but he certainly isn’t handsome, either. There’s just something about him. The way he walks…the way he smiles…the way his skullcap hangs askew…”</p>

<p align=left>“Skullcap, ye say? Would that be a blue skullcap, by any chance?”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes! You…you know him?”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye, ye mought say that.”</p>

<p align=left>The woman sighed. “Oh, Father, what I wouldn’t give…just to lie in his arms for one night! But…but I know that it’s wrong. I shouldn’t think of such things.”</p>

<p align=left>“Not so fast, milady!” said Santiago quickly. “It’s…it’s wrong to just stuff those thoughts away, whar they’ll fester an’ grow like a bloody disease. Ye ought to let ‘em out, let ‘em breathe fresh air, so as they won’t trouble ye no more!”</p>

<p align=left>“You mean…” her voice dropped. “You mean I should tell him how I feel?”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye, milady! After all, ain’t Honesty one o’ the Virtues?” He couldn’t remember whether it was or not, but it sounded good.</p>

<p align=left>“Yes…yes it is.” She was silent for a moment. “But what if he does not want me?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago peeked through the holes in the thin wall that separated the two of them. His eyes wandered eagerly up and down her young, voluptuous body. “Oh, he would want ye, milady! I’m sure of it!”</p>

<p align=left>Her eyes brightened. “Really? You really think so?”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye, I do. After all, who can resist a woman with Virtues such as yers? Ye got beautiful Virtues, milady.”</p>

<p align=left>The woman smiled. “You would not think so highly of my Virtue if you knew what I was thinking right now.”</p>

<p align=left>“Lustful thoughts, milady?”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes!” she whispered.</p>

<p align=left>Santiago loosened his collar. “Well, milady, I think ye ought to tell me everythin’.”</p>

<p align=left>“Oh, I couldn’t!”</p>

<p align=left>“Sure ye could! Don’t worry, milady…I’m a priest. Ye can tell me all yer secrets.” He leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p align=left>The woman sighed. “Well, I’ve been having this dream, lately. I dream that he ties me up and kidnaps me, carrying me aboard his pirate ship.”</p>

<p align=left>“A fate most terrible, milady! What does he do to ye then?”</p>

<p align=left>“Then…then he tortures me!”</p>

<p align=left>“He does?” Santiago scratched his chin. “But that don’t sound like somethin’ what Santiago would do. What does he do, whip ye?”</p>

<p align=left>“No…much worse. He…he tickles me.”</p>

<p align=left>“Ah, well that does sound like somethin’ Santiago would do. Whar does he tickle ye, milady?”</p>

<p align=left>“Everywhere! But it’s strange, Father. I want him to stop, I beg him to stop – yet at the same time, I find myself enjoying it! But no matter how much I squeal and writhe, he doesn’t stop. He torments me, making me say things like ‘Santiago is the finest sailor in all the world’.”</p>

<p align=left>“Forces ye to lie, eh? Well, that’s just awful.”</p>

<p align=left>“Actually it’s not that bad. But then there’s a gleam in his eyes. He lowers his face to mine, and I can tell that he is about to kiss me. Then there’s the sound of thunder!”</p>

<p align=left>“Thunder? Blimey…his kisses must be somethin’ else!”</p>

<p align=left>The woman laughed. “It’s not that, Father. There’s a storm…a terrible storm. The ship goes down. The water is cold and dark. I feel his arms around me, and then…nothing. When I wake up, I find myself alone with him on a deserted tropical island.”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye? What do ye do then?”</p>

<p align=left>“Then we…” She sighed deeply. “Then we make love.”</p>

<p align=left>“Tell me more, milady. Start at the beginnin’, an’ don’t leave out no details!”</p>

<p align=left>“Well, we’re just sitting there together on the sand, under the shade of a palm tree. The waves of the ocean lap insistently at the shore – such a pleasant, delightful rhythm. His arms hold me close, and I feed him a chocolate chip cookie.”</p>

<p align=left>“A choc’late chip cookie, ye say?”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, that’s all we have for food – several crates of cookies and rum.”</p>

<p align=left>“Well, what more do ye need?”</p>

<p align=left>“What more indeed. I can feel it within me, Father – a burning, aching desire. We sit there for quite a while, until I can’t stand it anymore. Without warning, I push him flat on his back and pin his arms to the sand.”</p>

<p align=left>“Blimey! Does he try to resist?”</p>

<p align=left>“No, not at all.” Her voice became low and sultry. “I lean down close to him, slowly sliding my body against his. I can tell that he enjoys it.”</p>

<p align=left>“Absolutely sinful! Please continue, milady.”</p>

<p align=left>Her breathing became more rapid. “I…I lower my face to his…we are only inches apart, now, if that much. His lips are so close to mine…so close I can feel his hot breath against my face…” She licked her lips. “And then…then we…”</p>

<p align=left>“Santiago, wake up!”</p>

<p align=left>“Huh? What?” Santiago opened his eyes and saw the fuzzy outline of a monk standing over him. “Go away, Brother Jacob,” he muttered sleepily. “Can’t ye see I’m tryin’ to hear a confession?”</p>

<p align=left>“What are you talking about?” said Jacob. “You’ve been asleep for the last eight hours. It’s time for you to wake up and rejoin the real world.”</p>

<p align=left>“I don’t like the real world,” grumbled Santiago. “I want the dream back.” He rolled over and shut his eyes, but it was useless. The dream was gone.</p>

<p align=left>Santiago sighed and rubbed his eyes. “Say…when do I get to hear confessions from people?”</p>

<p align=left>“When hell freezes over,” said Jacob mirthlessly. “Now get up and get dressed. We’ve got work to do.”</p>
