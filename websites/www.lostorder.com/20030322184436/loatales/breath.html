<p align=left><b>A Breath Of Life</b><br><i>by anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>“A second chance…”</p>

<p align=left>The world seemed silent. It was as if the very earth was lost in deep, unwavering thought. What would life bring anew to this perpetually tormented soul? Anguish ran through his veins, suffering occupied his bones, and misery engrossed his mind. </p>

<p align=left>“Revenge…”</p>

<p align=left>Each singular beat of his heart fanned the flames of vengeance, vengeance against life. Life renewed had presented him with pain and all that existed seemed to mock him. Had he known life without pain?</p>

<p align=left>“Life…”</p>

<p align=left>Life, remembrances, history, nothing. Recalling the past was an impossibility. There was no childhood, no adulthood, no life. Images of death hung about his mind like paintings. Hundreds upon hundreds of people, each in the throes of death, enwrapped in mortal grief. None were his own. He had been burdened with the pains of a thousand men. </p>

<p align=left>“Redemption…”</p>

<p align=left>Life had been cruel, but he had deserved it. He had been Stanic K’Vel, an aberrant and ghastly fiend of a man. Does a life of murder deserve less than the utmost retribution? Redemption was a distant goal. Atonement for his sins was unattainable. His soul would only be let rest after he had endured the suffering of those he had slain. Undoubtedly, this would take lifetimes. His head lain to the woodland floor, he shed a lone tear.</p>

<p align=left>“Something has brought me here…”</p>
