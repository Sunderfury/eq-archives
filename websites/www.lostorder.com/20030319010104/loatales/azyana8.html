<blockquote>
<p align=left>As he promised we met at the bank to work on my Armor Class. He is just so serious about this teaching thing. We went to the bank where he got a few items out and then we went to a place that was quieter. He asked me what my AC, wisdom and agility were. I started with an AC of 351, wisdom of 128 and agility of 73. He gave me a ring that would raise my agility by 3. My jaw dropped when I saw that it was a wedding ring. He must have seen that since he told me it was his mothers. I was honored that he entrusted me with something so valuable. He then asked how things changed. With that one ring my numbers changed to AC of 373, wisdom of 126 and agility of 76. I was a little worried about the drop of my wisdom, but he assured me that it was all right. He explained further that the wisdom used by a cleric is not affected much between increments of 5. That for me to have wisdom of 125 to 129 would be of no difference. He gave me a tunic to replace the bronze breastplate I had been wearing. Always a man of honor he turned away while I changed into it. With that change my AC is 368, wisdom of 130 and agility of 80. Well, I was really concerned then because the bronze breastplate had an AC higher than what he was letting me borrow. He calmed me down and then explained that a trade off of AC verses wisdom is a tradeoff that every cleric has to make. The change in wisdom brought me to the next level that I needed to be with a sacrifice of only 5 AC. I have no idea what the reaction of this new tunic will be. It is so sheer ya can see my undergarments. I told him of my concern of the sheerness of it then asked him if it pleased him to see me in it. I could not help but smile when he said he found it pleasing. He then added that if I was concerned with they way it looked then I could go back to my old one. I reminded him of the fact that my goal was to be a good cleric above all else and if this tunic attracted a little attention from on lookers so be it. Besides, I find the fact that he likes seeing me in it worth the loss of 5 AC. </p>

<p align=left>No sooner than we finished u p our talk of all these numbers he was called away to perform a resurrection. He asked me if I minded and of course I did not. While he was finishing up that one, he was called to do another. I decided to go back to my hunting spot in Southern Ro. Well I was so excited to try out my new equipment that I forgot my most basic lesson - cast Center and Holy armor upon myself. I was a little upset with myself but did not suffer too much because of it with the changes my golden one made to my equipment. I regained my mana and cast my protective spells upon myself, then went hunting again and while I was resting and meditating I could just sense his presence some how and he greeted me with a kiss upon my cheek. I could not help but smile. I asked him if it was hard being called away as he was and he said at times it was and is why he goes incognito. Him and his big words… We got to chat a few moments but then I had to leave for a change. We said our good byes and this time I was the one to run off. </p>

<p align=left>I decided to hunt a bit later on and was doing quite well, so close to my next circle. I engaged a ghoul and almost finished it off when it began to run away from me. I went to stun it but it resisted. I then tried to root, but no mana left. I ran after it determined to make more progress before my next lesson but then a ghoul attacked me from behind. I was so confused. I thought it was the I was running after, but it had been a new one and there was just no way to defend myself and I died. I decided my desire to get to my next level was too strong and was making stupid mistakes so after I gathered my belongings I decided it was time to stop and just write down my thoughts for the day. </p>

<p align=left>I haven't decided if I am going to tell my golden one of my mistake this eve, which caused my death. I will have to sleep on that one. The hour is late and I must get my rest. I do not want my golden one to see me all tired when I meet him for my next lesson.</p>
