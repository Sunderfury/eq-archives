<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">It
is not easy to run through the woods at night while drunk. Greyhawk denied that he was
drunk, but for some reason he kept falling down. While lying on the ground, he would start
to giggle for no reason at all. He could tell that the dwarves were angry at him for the
delay, but that only made him laugh even more.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We should just
leave him here,&quot; growled Jarlaxle. &quot;He&#146;s costing us time.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Rothan shook his
head. &quot;We have to bring him with us. He is the chosen one.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Chosen one? Who
chose him?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;The gods.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Hmph. The gods
aren&#146;t too bloody bright, are they? Kileyan, isn&#146;t there some sort of spell you
can cast that will sober him up?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye, there is,
but I couldn&#146;t afford it.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Jarlaxle pointed his
finger at Bierfreund. &quot;This is all your fault, you know. If you hadn&#146;t given him
all that ale&#133;&quot; Bierfreund shrugged his shoulders.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I am not
drunk,&quot; said Greyhawk as he struggled to stand up. &quot;It must be an evil spell of
some kind.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Yup. Uh huh.
Sure.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It must
be,&quot; insisted Greyhawk. &quot;The goblins have foreseen my arrival, and they are
afraid!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Quit
talkin&#146; like a bleedin&#146; fool,&quot; Dargo snapped. &quot;We have to get to the
goblin camp. It&#146;s almost midnight!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Don&#146;t
worry,&quot; said Greyhawk. &quot;My legs are twice as tall as yours, so I can run twice
as fast. Watch!&quot; He began to sprint down the path, but then tripped again and landed
in the dirt.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;This is going
to be a long bloody night,&quot; muttered Dargo.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"></font><font color="#0080C0"><img src="greenbar.gif" alt="greenbar.gif (1894 bytes)" WIDTH="271" HEIGHT="12"></font><font size="4"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font size="4" color="#0080C0">The full
moon had risen, and bats flew through the air overhead, their high-pitched cries echoing
eerily through the canyons.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Kherghon eyed the
bats uneasily. &quot;An ill omen, if ever I saw one.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The heroes crept
through the forest as silently as they could, considering that most of them were still
feeling the effects of the dwarven ale. At one point, Bierfreund stopped and turned
around.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;The goblins are
on the other side of that hill,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Walterus began to run
toward the hill, but Eshay grabbed him by the back of his tunic and lifted him up in the
air. His little feet kept trying to run.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Put me
down!&quot; yelled the dwarf. &quot;I&#146;ve got some goblin smashing to do!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We need a
plan,&quot; said Eshay.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;What for?
Let&#146;s just run in and kill &#145;em all!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;While that is a
brilliant plan,&quot; said Rothan, &quot;I still think we need a strategy.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;If I got close
enough,&quot; said Penaden, &quot;I could play a magical song that would shatter their
eardrums and make them wish they were dead!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That sounds
like every song you play,&quot; said Jarlaxle.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well, whatever
we&#146;re going to do, we have to do it quick,&quot; said Kherghon. &quot;We&#146;re
almost out of time.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Let&#146;s just
run in and kill &#145;em all!&quot; said Walterus again.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Rothan sighed.
&quot;All right. I&#146;ll send my elemental ahead to lead the attack,&quot; said Rothan.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Oh no you
don&#146;t!&quot; cried the elemental. &quot;You&#146;re not going to send me to my death
again, like last time! You know how hard it is to come back and forth between here and the
Plane of Fire? Well it&#146;s pretty darn hard, let me tell you!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Fine. I&#146;ll
just send you back to Everfrost, then. You can guard something meaningless for a couple of
years. How would you like that?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The elemental
shivered. &quot;All right, all right. I&#146;ll do it. Good-bye, cruel master. I&#146;m
sure we&#146;ll meet again, unfortunately.&quot; The elemental drifted toward the goblin
camp with all the despondence of a criminal awaiting execution.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Walterus gripped his
axe with both hands. When he thought about the coming battle, it was hard for him not to
drool. &quot;This is gonna be fun!&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"></font><font color="#0080C0"><img src="greenbar.gif" alt="greenbar.gif (1894 bytes)" WIDTH="271" HEIGHT="12"></font><font size="4"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Gumgum was not a
happy goblin. He did not like the Butcherblok mountains to begin with, and the fact that
there were mean little dwarves all over the place made it worse. But he was a member of
the Green Dragon clan, and he had to go wherever they went, whether he liked it or not. To
make matters worse, the clan chieftain was an utter lunatic. He was always carrying around
a great big egg as if it was a holy artifact. Gumgum and the others wanted to cook the egg
for dinner, but the chieftain would not hear of it. He would not explain why, but instead
muttered something about &#145;waiting for a sign from the gods&#146;.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Well, Gumgum thought
this was nonsense, until a lightning bolt fell from the sky and blew up one of the tents.
The gods had spoken! The goblins stared at the flames in religious awe &#150; all except
for those who had been inside the tent, and were now running around screaming because they
were on fire.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Gumgum looked around,
but the chieftain was nowhere to be seen. Instead, there were about a dozen dwarves, elves
and humans charging toward the camp with weapons drawn.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"></font><font color="#0080C0"><img src="greenbar.gif" alt="greenbar.gif (1894 bytes)" WIDTH="271" HEIGHT="12"></font><font size="4"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="center"><img src="http://www.gamecore.net/everquest/screenshots/santi_end12_battle.jpg" width="618" height="428" alt="santi_end12_battle.jpg (85209 bytes)"></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Walterus was a happy
dwarf. There were few sounds as pleasant as the &#145;crunch&#146; his axe made when it
sliced through goblin skin and bone, and the high-pitched scream of agony that followed.
He felt as though he was composing music as he fought his way through the goblin horde
&#150; crunch, scream, crunch, scream.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He glanced over at
Dargo, who had just launched himself into the middle of the fray. The dwarven paladin had
lost his axe when he planted it in a goblin&#146;s back, and he was now punching and
biting his foes. The goblins were terrified of the little monster who was ripping them
apart with his bare hands.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund and
Kherghon had come in from the other side, and the goblins were caught in a dwarven vise
that was slowly closing and crushing them. Greyhawk, Jarlaxle and Eshay kept close watch
at the edges of the battlefield, making sure that none of the creatures escaped. From the
top of the hill, Rothan and Kileyan hurled spells of fire and destruction. But more
devastating still were the noxious songs that Penaden played on his lute. The goblins
writhed and clutched their ears in agony, praying for a merciful end to their suffering.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Now they know
how it feels,&quot; muttered Jarlaxle.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The battle was long
and bloody. Despite their overwhelming numbers, the goblins were unable to pierce the
solid ring of death that surrounded them. One by one, they fell to sword and spell. The
end was drawing near.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Then there came a
sound that caused the combatants to pause. Even the dwarves held their blades in check,
and stopped to listen as the entire valley echoed with a terrible, deafening roar &#150; a
roar such as a dragon might make.</font></font></p>
