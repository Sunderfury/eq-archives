<p align=left><b>The Fire Within</b><br><i>by Greyhawk</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Alone he stood at the top of the tower, mesmirized by the flickering flames of the torches. The pulsating heat surrounded him at all corners, a barrier of protection from the cold, harsh wind outside. Despite the undying warmth around him, Orion Red felt none of it as he stared into the flames. "So simple to keep the torch burning," he thought. "Yet so difficult to keep the fire within from dying."</p>

<p align=left>The immense trees of Glendon Wood soon came into view as he continued his run down the snow covered path. A sharp contrast to the shoreline towns, Glendon rested peacefully in seclusion, nestled deep in the forest for those who sought refuge. Orion would never visit on his own accord, he simply did not fit the mold of a woodland type. Though he felt safe walking through the town, he couldn't help but notice the wary glances coming from the merchant windows. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a familiar figure haggling with a local peddler. In one sudden moment, fears subsided, sorrows vanished, and the sounds of the forest became sweet music as Orion gazed upon the reason for his journey.</p>

<p align=left>"Stop daydreamin' and come talk to me," said Gwenneth with a smile.</p>

<p align=left>Orion woke from his trance, failing to hide his blushing face. "Pardon me m'lady, I must have dozed off fer a minute."</p>

<p align=left>"Tis quite alright m'dear," she replied, holding in her laughter. "I was not expectin' ye for at least another day."</p>

<p align=left>Normally, Orion could lie and hide the truth without so much as a drop of sweat. But as he looked into her eyes, his knees began to buckle and words escaped him.</p>

<p align=left>"I grew tired of huntin' the shoreline m'lady," he answered as his voice began to stutter. "I thought that...maybe...we could adventure here in the forest. O'course, I didn't mean to intrude, and I'm sure ye had other..."</p>

<p align=left>"Of course I'd like to hunt with ye!" interrupted Gwenneth as she stepped closer towards him. "And I know just the place for us."</p>

<p align=left>"And where might that be?" asked Orion with a startled look.</p>

<p align=left>"Just follow me silly," she answered with a wink and a smile.</p>

<p align=left>By his patron's orders, Orion had sworn to protect the fair lady Gwenneth at all costs. It was a different assignment for him to say the least, one which he wasn't sure how or if he could handle. He worried that she might learn of his troubled past, his days spent smuggling illegal goods from port to port. Or even worse, that she learn of the tavern incidents which he's still trying to forget. Regardless of his orders, he wanted nothing more than to spend time with her, to share his stories, to learn about her dreams. Her mere presence brought life back into his tired, old soul, something he could not deny.</p>

<p align=left>"Well, here we are!" shouted Gwenneth as she approached a large stone doorway. "The old Glendon prison was built underground here, into the adjoining hill".</p>

<p align=left>"It looks abandoned, eh? Are ye sure 'bout this m'lady?" questioned Orion as he scratched his beard.</p>

<p align=left>"Rumor is that quite a few beings walk the halls deep inside, and they be none too friendly," Gwenneth answered as she began to tighten her armor and ready her weapons.</p>

<p align=left>Orion felt his adrenalin surge as he reached for his crossbow. "Stay close to me, and I'll keep ye from harm m'lady. But I still ain't sure 'bout messin' with the undead," he said in a serious tone.</p>

<p align=left>"We must keep the fire burnin' somehow m'dear," Gwenneth replied with a chuckle as she ran down the dark hallway.</p>

<p align=left>Orion paused for a moment, feeling something long forgotten building inside him. In that dimly hit hallway, unsure of the path ahead, he managed to smile.</p>
