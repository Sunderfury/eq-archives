<p align=left><b>Torments Of The Past</b><br><i>by Alavon Highwind</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The forests of Yew are home to many people and animals, providing shelter, comfort, and protection to all those that would call her home. For some, the trees give a new chance at life, a clean slate if you will. But for some, not even the enchantment of these ancient woods can erase the past. Somewhere in this forest, a lost soul searches for himself. Hidden away in the groves of trees, one man attempts to find answers that have evaded him for so very long. Not even the light has brought him peace, but rather just pushed it down. Here we find this soul, fatigued and perhaps losing sanity.</p>

<p align=left>A man is seen standing in a grove, his hands gripping something tightly. We can see his mouth move, uttering a short phrase, louder and louder until he is shouting. "IN LOR!!!!!!" Nothing happens. No light, no smoke, simply nothing. The man throws the reagents to the ground and grabs his head with both hands, attempting to calm his rage. Very few features can be seen about this man, as he is covered by a dark cloak. A hood covers his head, but locks of golden hair can be seen, shining in the moonlight. The man sits on a log and hangs his head. The sounds of sobbing can be made out if one listens close enough. Suddenly, a woman in a torn dress breaks into the glade, tears running down her face as she cries histerically. A man runs behind her yelling, obviously drunk, weilding a sword. The cloaked man looks up slowly, not making any action as this scene crosses his view. As the drunken man passes, an arrow is shot, hitting the man in the leg. The cloaked man stands, his bow in hand. The drunken man howls in pain as he attempts to tear out the arrow. The archer simply looks at him, and slowly turns his back and walks away. Curses are hurled at him from the man, but he doesn't respond. It is all clear to him now. They have something of his, and he will take it back. No more holding back, he will do what must be done. He will be whole again. As he nears the Abbey, he sees a boat docked, cargo being loaded. "Where is this vessel traveling too?" asked the cloaked man. "To Moonglow sir" the crewman responded. "Thank you.", said the man as he walked on board. "It will end soon, and with that I will find peace. Alwith's son will be whole once again. Soon, those men who so long ago attacked a mother and child will fear every sound in the night. They will dread the name Alavon Highwind, for I am no longer the hunted. They shall soon know how I felt for 17 years. There time has come." These thoughts run through Alavons head as he falls asleep, resting for, perhaps, his last days.</p>
