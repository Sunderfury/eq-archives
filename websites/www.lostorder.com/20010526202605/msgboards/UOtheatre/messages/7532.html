<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">	A galleon was passing by overhead, its white sails bulging and billowing in the wind currents of the celestial sea.  Slowly, slowly it drifted, without a care in the world.  Its course predetermined, it would drift lazily westward until it lost itself somewhere in that distant blue horizon.  A crew of angels peered out over the ivory rail, marveling at the world far below.<p>	When he was young, Santiago had spent many afternoons on that grassy hill overlooking the bay of Britain.  Hands folded behind his head, eyes staring upward at the soft white clouds drifting by.  Heaven’s Armada, he called them.  It brought a smile to his face, to think that there were angels up there.<p>	“Wind’s pickin’ up, cap’n.”<p>	Santiago nodded, but said nothing.  His dark eyes roamed over the watery miles.<p>	“We aimin’ fer Serpent’s Hold?  Figger we could make port by nightfall.”<p>	Santiago shook his head.  “We’re not goin’ to Serpent’s Hold.  Too crowded.”<p>	“Crowded?  Ye think the duke has men thar already?”<p>	“Aye, I’m sure of it.  Soon as Rastalle learned what happened, he probably sent his mages up and down the coast, and to every isle.  I reckon thar’s not a safe harbor in the warld fer us right now.”<p>	“Now thar’s a glum thought.”  The tillerman scratched his skullcap.  “When’s this gonna end, cap’n?  We can’t go on runnin’ forever.  Sooner or later, they’ll catch up to us; ye know they will.  An’ then we’ll be swingin’ by our necks.  I mought be old, but I’m still too darn young to die.”<p>	“Sorry, Knife.  I didn’t mean to get us into this mess.”<p>	“I don’t care if ye did.  All I’m sayin’ is that we gotta get ourselves out of it.”<p>	Santiago closed his eyes and rubbed his eyelids.  “Any ideas how to go about that?”<p>	“Yer askin’ <i>me</i>?”<p>	“Aye.”<p>	“Well, methinks the best thing to do would be to lie low fer a good long while.  Let this bloody business blow over while we do some fishin’ somewhar down near Devil’s Isle.  Few months from now, no one will even remember all this stuff.  Heck, even I have a hard time keepin’ it all straight.”<p>	“Can’t do that, Knife.  I can’t just go away an’ hide while the warld collapses.”<p>	“Sure ye can.  It’s called survival.”<p>	“Naw, it’s called cowardice.”  Santiago leaned forward.  “Look, the king’s in danger.  I gotta warn ‘im somehow, b’fore it’s too late.”<p>	Mr. Knife shook his head.  “You an’ yer bloody sense o’ loyalty.”<p>	Santiago smiled faintly.  It was the first time he had smiled in a while.<p>	“So I s’pose we’re headin’ to Britain again, eh?”<p>	“Aye, but we can’t go thar directly.  That’s just what Rastalle would expect us to do.  Naw, we gotta figger a way to get into Britain without bein’ seen.  Thar’s no way we can do that by boat.” <p>	“So what do ye have in mind, then?”<p>	Santiago shrugged.  “Nothin’ as yet.  But don’t worry; I’ll figger out somethin’.”<p>	“Who’s worried?”  The tillerman crossed himself.  “Say, while yer thinkin’...what do ye plan on doin’ with Miss Deadly?”<p>	“Did ye tie her up like I asked?”<p>	“Aye, she’s strapped to the bed in yer quarters...”  Mr. Knife took off his skullcap and swatted Santiago with it.  “Now don’t ye be gettin’ any funny ideers!”<p>	“Me?  I wasn’t...”<p>	“Yes ye were.  I can see it plain as it were written on yer stupid face.”  He pointed a finger at the young pirate.  “Mind who she is.  She killed Lucero, an’ Lard knows how many else besides.  She’d kill me, an’ she’d sure as heck kill you if she got the chance.  If ye ask me, we ought to throw her overboard an’ be done with her.”<p>	“Aye?  Well I didn’t ask ye.  ‘Sides, I need her...I mean, we need her.  We...we need to keep her alive.  She’s our hostage.”<p>	“Aye, she’s our hostage, an’ that’s all that she is.  Remember that.”<p>	“Awright, awright.  Spare me yer lectures, ol’ crow.  I’m takin’ a nap.”<p>	“’Ey!  B’fore ye run off, what course should I be settin’?”<p>	Santiago pointed to the sky.  “Follow that cloud.  It’s got angels on it.”<p>	“Angels?!  What the bloody...?  Cap’n?”<p>	But Santiago had already climbed down into the ship’s hold.  Mr. Knife was left alone on the deck, with no one to complain to.  That didn’t stop him, of course...<p>	“Angels, me arse.  If he thinks he can just go off an’ sleep while I do all the work, then he’ll have to think again!  Right, that’s it.  I’ve had it.  Soon as this bloody journey is over – an’ hopefully it’ll be over soon – I’m findin’ another ship!  A ship with a captain what’s got all his marbles, an’ what pays me decent.  To heck with this bloody boat...an’ may her cap’n get eat’n by fishes!”<p>	The tirade continued for quite some time, despite the lack of an audience.  But for all of his oaths and expletives, the old tillerman somehow managed to steer toward the drifting cloud.  The wind was strong, and the ship made excellent progress in its journey to nowhere in particular.<p>(to be continued...)<p></font>
