<p align=left><b>Gnomes Unite Tonight!</b><br><i>by Wiskinyary</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The following letter is delivered to each of you by a mechanical gnome. It is purportedly a message from Wiskinyary, though the scribbled, spidery handwriting doesn't seem to be his...</p>

<p align=left>"Greetings, young gnomes!</p>

<p align=left>"I regret to inform you that I have undertaken a secret mission for Ak'Anon, and I will be away for a short time. In my absence, I hereby nominate, designate and appoint Wimble to be the Commander and Supreme Overlord until such time as I return. You will obey his every order and do his will - even if he asks you to do something naughty, like smearing skunk glands on sleeping elves. Failure to comply with these orders will result in execution and reanimation as an undead slave.</p>

<p align=left>"You will meet Wimble in the Steamfont Mountains outside the gates of Ak'Anon at precisely half-past eight o'clock on this very night.</p>

<p align=left>"Oh, and make sure that you destroy this letter. Eat it, burn it, bury it...I don't care, just make sure that no one else discovers our plans!"</p>

<p align=left>The letter is signed "Wiskinyary" - but again, it just doesn't look like his signature (and he doesn't usually draw a skull beneath his name).</p>
