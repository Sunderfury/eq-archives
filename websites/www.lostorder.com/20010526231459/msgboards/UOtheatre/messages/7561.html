I have less resist and eval so I can have wrestling, and its still great for killing monsters.  I have the wrestling because I get some interesting lag problems and its nice to come back from a lag-hole and still be alive.  The other thing wrestling does for me is allow me to defeat the occasional dex monkey in a fight, or in heavy spawn areas, I can sometimes defeat teams of dex monkeys, as long as none of them are archers.</font>
