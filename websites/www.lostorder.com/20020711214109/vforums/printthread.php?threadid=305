<p><b> Discussion of news item</b></p>

<p>Here's a thread for people to discuss my news item on the front LOA page. Feel free to flame, whinge, discuss, argue, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Like I said in my news item, we need more guild events together! Pick a date, pick an objective (Claim a keep, raid DF, explore an enemy frontier) and get it organised! Anybody can organise an event, it just needs thought, dedication and planning. I will be too busy for the next week, and maybe for the week after; but after then I'll get my thinking-cap on and start planning away for fun things we can do.<br />
<br />
Discuss! That's a polite request, not the harsh order it might sound like...<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >__________________<br>

<p>Ok.. here's the deal...<br />
<br />
<br />
Like Greg, I have big plans a brewing for Akalabethians in DAoC.  Once I figure out my work schedule, I'm going to have a guild group night, set for every week at a scheduled time.  <br />
<br />
I like to call it <font color="red">Phy Nigh</font> <br />
<br />
Every week it's going to be something different. But it will not include RvR.  Greggar is going to set that stuff up so he'll try to be an "unofficial" external event person and I'll try to be the "unofficial" internal event guy.  <br />
<br />
What kind of events eh?  It's gonna be stuff where we all will get to know each other... maybe not in the same night, but eventually.  One night might be powerleveling level 20's night, where I'll need one or two level 40's (or Chao or Solf), where we fight stuff red/low purple to us and let the lowbies reap the benefits.  Another night might be a Llyn Barfog Raid night or a Darkness Falls night.  So we might not all be able to go on an XP/Loot raid (because it's too dangerous), but they'll be times where we will be able to go together.  <br />
<br />
The times when we ALL will be together is the RvR nights that Greggar is going to set up.  EVERYONE is welcome... and hopefully expected to come if possible... to this event.  RvR can be awesome some nights.. and be horrible others, but at least we'll be doing it together, and we'll all be there.<br />
<br />
The reason for this of course is to level up but more so.. to get to know each other better.  For those of us who have to read what happens at gatherings for some reason or another instead of being there, this is where we'll learn about each other and what we do.  So yeah... the conversation will be a little bit more on a personal level, but I think that's one of the great things about our guild... we don't just hide behind our "cover names".. we care about the person behind it (and their families too).<br />
<br />
So.... when will it start? Not sure... I'm thinking on Tuesday's or Wednesdays about 8 central.. but like I said.. gotta figure out my work schedule.  But this is and WILL happen.  I'll post the event on the boards most likely the Sunday before it happens, and will have a signup, first come first serve, for the number and levels we need.  This is a GUILD event and such, they'll be events we can do by ourselves or VERY close friends of the guild.  <br />
<br />
If you have any questions or comments, post 'em here, and don't forget to comment on Greg's ideas.<br />

<p>This sounds super, guys.  My one suggestion would be to please use Guildevents.com to schedule this stuff.  I think if we all get into the habit of using it we'll be a LOT more successful in gathering large groups of Akalabethians together.<br />
<br />
Also, lemme just beg forgiveness in advance if we make you non-gathering folks feel left out <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="">  I know we'll be subjecting /gu to a ton of inside jokes and "This one time, at the hotel" stories in the coming weeks.   The good news is that we killed so many brain cells we're sure to forget Atlanta specifics before too long <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
For the record.. my main playtimes are Sun-Thurs 5-10 PM Eastern.  I'm happy to join weekend events, but it helps to know about them in advance so's I don't make other plans.<br />
<br />
Please LMK if either of you need assistance in planning/organizing/publicizing/executing these events.</p>

I wouldn't worry about us folks who were not at the gathering.  I don't think any of us will get mad with the slew of inside jokes that are going to be flying back and forth.<br />
<br />
Besides it's not like we didn't do things while you guys were away. It was pretty fun when we all created characters that were named some variation of Cazz (I had Cazzz and Phy had Cazzster for example) and did really embarrassing things with them. It was quite a sight when ten Cazzs were all killed by a single brownie (over a dozen times).<br />
<br />
Well maybe that didn't happen but it should have.<br />
<br />
Hope everyone had fun.<br />

<p>hahaha...<br />
<br />
Ya, don't feel bad. If anything, it is sneaky-promoting for our future gatherings. People now can see just how fun and out of control the gatherings can be.<br />

<p>No feel bad, you're supposed to say it was crap and you hated it. I for one am not likely to ever get to a gathering for the next, wait for it, THREE fecking years! Being a student, with low money sucks, especially when the next gathering is sheduled for the last week in September. The first weekend on the new Uni term next year, when all the young impressionable, nubile... erm I mean naive, Freshers arrive....<br />
<br />
I'll be damned if I'm missing <b>that</b>!<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >__________________<br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon10.gif" alt="Talking" width="15" height="15" border="0"> </b></p>

<p>I know that I'm all for any kind of guild events. I have the most fun when playing with friends so I try not to pass guildies up. Bruti and Neebear (Friar/cleric) are now lvl 20 so we'll be getting some PvP-type skills in the BGs, so we will hopefully be of some assistance in the RvR stuff. I know we're too low right now, but maybe plaing in the BG will drive us to want to level faster for good RvR.<br />
<br />
And as for Fistan not being able to go to the next 3 years... well, I'm sure if you were able to hook some of the guys up with rooms in the chick's dorms at your Uni, we'll come to you for the next gathering.<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >__________________<br>

<p>Fistan and Phyleus,<br />
<br />
Your ideas look wonderful <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> We definitely need to have as many organized events as possible to keep interest in DAOC constantly renewed. So whats first on the agenda?<p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >__________________<br>

<p>I don't know how many people we have in the guild, or even the alliance, that have never seen RvR (like a keep siege), but I know the first time Stenchy's Traveling Circus went on a raid, we had an absolute blast! As newbies, we didn't realize there was that much more out there and to the game. Like when we ran between the legs of that gigantic ice giant in Midgard... I nearly pooed myself. And seeing 4 teams working together to take down the keeps was awe-inspiring. It made us want to do more to try and get up to RvR status.<br />
<br />
Perhaps one event could be to introduce newbies to the world of RvR and bring a lot of them out (with high-level members of course) so they can get thier whistles' wet for RvR. <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><p><font face="verdana, arial, helvetica" size="2" >__________________<br>
