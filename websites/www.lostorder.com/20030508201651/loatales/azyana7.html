<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Seven</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I did not see my golden one this eve for very long but was so happy to see him. I did get to see him take down a sand giant by himself. He was so happy about it, and it was good to see him smile that way.</p>

<p align=left>While I was in Freeport the other eve I wanted to get him something as a token of my appreciation for all the time he had been taking training me. I went from shop to shop not finding much but I did find a simple gold band. So when I first saw him this eve I gave it to him making sure that he knew that it had no magical powers to it, rather it was just a symbol of my being grateful for all his teachings. He said he would wear it while he sleeps and that it did have magical power because it would remind him of me … or something like that. </p>

<p align=left>I had taken my bloodforge hammer out of the bank and was using it this eve. He did notice I was using a different weapon and that began my lesson for this evening - weapons. He said that a 2hb would serve me well until I am about 30 but then after that I would be holding different things. Until then I should use my 2hb and then my 1hb to keep up my skill in it. I took a look at what he was carrying and he said both his weapon and shield added to his wisdom, which is at 175 compared to my 124. I felt like such a child again, but he said for my age it was good.</p>

<p align=left>The use of my 2hb brought up another problem. He had been so proud that he only had to heal me once before this eve. Well, this eve was different. No matter what I did I seemed to be getting more injured than before. He said it was due to my lack of the AC that the shield provided. It seemed as though things hit me harder and the poisons that got to me took on a new strength. He said that was also due to my AC. He did say that there was something that I could do and that would be to raise my agility. He also said that he had a few items in the bank to help me. I made sure it would only be a loan since I did not want him to think I was taking advantage of his kindness. He agreed and we will be meeting at the bank next time before my lesson.</p>

<p align=left>He did warn me though that the new items may change my look but we both agreed that it is better to equip myself to be a good cleric than to just look good. </p>

<p align=left>I was asked to group by a bard and my golden one encouraged me to do that since it was late and he had to leave. Well… the bard was quite impressed that I stunned a mummy to stop it from running instead of rooting it. I felt so proud since I used a skill that my golden one had only taught me a few days before and did it at the right time. I can't wait to tell him!</p>

<p align=left>He mentioned again that place of Unrest. He said that I would be ready to go there once I reached half way through my next level. I am still concerned with him being away from his hunting companions, but then again I do look forward to my lessons.</p>

<p align=left>I grouped with Diencet and we did good battles against whatever was in our abilities and a little more. The hour was late and since I still had SoW on me I decided to make my way to the bank. All my transactions done I made my way here back to the inn. It is late and I must get some rest. I hope I get to see him not too long after I awake.</p>
