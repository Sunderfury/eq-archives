<p align=left><b>The Warrior and the Druid</b><br><i>by Diencet</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It was late in the day as I sat resting from my recent confrontation with the residents of Lavastorm at the entrance from to Najena when I heard a thunderous voice speak out, "Hey there young druid!" As i peered over the top of the book I was reading I saw this enormous barbarian clad in fine armor and wielding a huge axe!</p>

<p align=left>I stood and greeted Waran, whom I had meet on occasions while wandering. As I bowed he proceeded to slap me on the back and laugh. "How goes it? You look tattered."</p>

<p align=left>I replied, "Aye, I have been fighting hard in this place that the kind Az has pointed me to," after catching my breath from the greeting of the warrior.</p>

<p align=left>I asked what his destitnation was this day and replied, "Ahh, I am going to clear out the place known as Najena." I had never dared to enter Najena and knew little of it. I told Waran this he let out a tremendous roaring laugh and said with a hearty grin, "We must change that! Rest up and I will take you with me into the bellows of Najena!"</p>

<p align=left>I was excited and ready to go as soon as I had rested enough...and so the druid filed in behind the elder warrior and entered the dungeon known as Najena.</p>

<p align=left>We proceeded slowly at first considering all the beasts that lay ahead of us as we walked. We were overwhelmed at one point and Waran decided instead of us searching for the monster he would bring them to me!</p>

<p align=left>He brought many a worthy opponent and if i got into trouble he raised that mighty axe above his head and brought it down upon the poor creatues I fought. We fought for sometime when this rather large troll happened upon us the mighty warrior Waran greeted the newcomer the same as he did me (unlike I, the troll did not budge) the troll returned the gesture. I soon found out it was another member of the family that I had heard so much of, Dukot, had come to slay the denizens of Najena also. We parted, and the troll went his way while Waran and I were set upon by almost every creature in the dungeon. Some hapless adventure had surpassed his abilities and tried escaping when he failed to escape they turned on us I immediatley felt the affects of the attack I looked to waran and there on that barbarian's face was a huge smile. I believe he was enjoying himself very much; but for my safety we retreated into Lavastorm.
By that time it had grown late and we were both weary...even the warrior. We said our goodbyes and parted for the night as I would always remember this trip of the elder warrior and the aspiring young druid!</p>
