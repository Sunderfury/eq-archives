<p align=left><b>Come The Watchmen</b><br><i>by GrimJack</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Grimjack sat straight up in bed with a start. It was still dark outside, but he was sure sunrise was not far off. The lich chased him down again and again he died as he woke up. They say you should never die in your dreams; maybe that’s why he always survives the first shot. The threesome had found lodging in Rithwic easy to come by, an out of the way town, used mainly as a stopping point for anyone wanting to walk to Eastham. The people of Rithwic were on the whole very nice with a propensity for making apply brandy. There were numerous orchards around town; infested with drudges during the day hours that get run out by shreths as evening approaches. </p>

<p align=left>The sun began peeking over the horizon, sending the day’s first rays of light into Grimjack’s room. Rising to his feet, he began to wash his face at the basin provided by the Inn when he heard a knock at the door.</p>

<p align=left>“Who’s it?”</p>

<p align=left>“Vizier. Get up already, the day is almost over.”</p>

<p align=left>Grimjack stared at the door blankly and wondered aloud whether Vizier was human or not.</p>

<p align=left>“I am. Now that you’re awake, I’ll go roust Cyvreaux. See you downstairs.”</p>

<p align=left>Grimjack could not hear Vizier walk away from the door, but it was rare to hear a woodsmen pass at all. Throwing on his heavy coat, he headed downstairs.</p>

<p align=left>“’Mornin’” said Cyvreaux as he held his head two inches above his bowl of porridge. Grimjack wasn’t sure his eyes were even open yet, but it mattered little. They were alone in the tavern part of the inn so there was nothing else to see.</p>

<p align=left>“Did you find your washbowl, Cyv?” Grimjack hoped that he had found the bowl and used it, or even better had found his way into the nearby river, whether by accident or not, just something to get him clean.</p>

<p align=left>“’Mornin’” was the only reply as Cyvreaux picked up his spoon and began slurping.</p>

<p align=left>Grimjack searched the room for Vizier and spotted him in the kitchen, helping to make breakfast for the patrons that weren’t here yet. Grimjack marveled at Vizier’s helpfulness as he began spooning up the porridge. Suddenly, the door to the tavern was thrown open, striking the wall behind it and almost splintering. Grimjack looked up from his meal and grimaced. The stranger had all the features of Zimmer, but older. The connection was obvious, but he was hoping that it was coincidence. The stranger strode to the bar and motioned to the barkeep as he unrolled a piece of parchment. The barkeep nodded and pointed in the direction of the still slurping Cyvreaux and Grimjack.</p>

<p align=left>“Have either of you gentlemen seen this man?” the stranger inquired, holding out the parchment.</p>

<p align=left>Grimjack stared at the parchment, a virtual copy of the one in his pack and nodded.</p>

<p align=left>“Aye, I seen him. I figure you fer his relative, ain’t that right?”</p>

<p align=left>“He is my younger brother.”</p>

<p align=left>“Sorry friend, he ‘was’ your younger brother.” Grimjack never knew quite how to tell someone that a relative was dead, and he hoped he didn’t get in much practice. The stranger quietly folded up the parchment, nodded and left the tavern.</p>

<p align=left>“I found some more bodies last night” was all the commentary Cyvreaux could offer between gulps of porridge.</p>
