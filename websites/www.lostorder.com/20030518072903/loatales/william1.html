<p align=left><b>Journal of a Scholar Part I</b><br><i>by Friar William</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>As I slowly opened my eye's my head felt like a whole tribe of Orcs just slammed it with their waraxes. What is this place? Where am I? As much as I tried I couldn't recall how I arrived at this mildly lit room. I could see a young person standing behind a bar of what appeared to be a tavern. The only customer didn't appear to say much. In fact the flickering light of the torches and the rather quiet room frightened me abit. Why was I here? Libraries, museums, castle halls, observatories that's where I tend to spend my last years of my life, not at these drinking establishments where the young lads gather to drink, tell stories and flatter the women. Oh my poor head! </p>

<p align=left>I was still struggling to find out where I was and even to stand up streight as the barkeep approached me. A young lad he seemed to lack the ability or will to hide his intentions. He began a barrage of questions: what was I doing here? Am I aware some persons are looking for me? What is my research about? Am I aware I'm in danger? In my long years as a scholar I knew better then to answer all these direct question to such a fickle man as a barkeeper. I answerred some questions vaguely and concealed my current research to the best of my ability. </p>

<p align=left>When the young lad became abit too nosy in my affairs I cried I knew nothing of this business and stumbled out of the tavern into the cold Britannian night. My weary ol' legs couldn't carry me far though, I entered the first building I saw. The lad followed me inside and seemed to realise his blunt ways of questionning would not work. He began explaining where I was, Fogwood Village. Hmmm, now that rang a bell, NOW I remember, I came to seek out the Fogwood Library! The lad offered to show it to me, somewhat hesitant I accepted his offer. </p>

<p align=left>Aah, smell that lovely scent of old wood, worn down paper and dried up ink! This was surely a welcome change to the grim looking tavern and the cold outside air. Instinctively my ol' fingers began filtering through some books at a writing desk. What!?!? Look! All those books, all those containers of humane and arcane knowledge were locked up behind a counter! Clearly upset I asked the barkeeper where the Librarian was, I needed to access these books as soon as possible! I could hardly believe when the lad said the Librarian left the Library. He told me to come back another time, aparently 'some' persons could help me reach the other books. </p>

<p align=left>He asked if he could help, if there was any particular book I was looking for. By this time I began to trust this bold young lad, I wispered 'The Tome of Making', and I immediatly looked around to scout for hiden ears. Aparently that seemed to strike him, as he turned visibly pale. After a few moments he regained his boldness and said he would seek for this book. By this time I was very tired of the recent events, parhaps I should have run those few yards out of the tavern. I asked what direction the Empathy Abbey was, I was in need of some rest. He kindly sent me in the right direction and in a few minutes the glooming lihgts of the Village disappeared and the darkness engulfed me.</p>
