<p align=left><b>Diary Entry</b><br><i>by Vojo</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>When I received the notice, that my friend Wyll needed assistance in Ak'Anon, I traveled as fast as Brell would allow, from Freeport to Ak'Anon. The boat ride was, as usual, uneventful. I still say they need Barkeeps on those galleons!! Nothing like tossing back an ale to keep the quite dull trip "eventful" so to speak... </p>

<p align=left>I arrived to the location that Wyll spoke of in his letter. I must say, it has been many a night since I've been in my home city. Almost brought me to tears seeing all me old kindred running around through our cozy town. Nothing like spending many nights sleeping among the hummies in Freeport to make you home sick! Once arriving in the bar, many a Walaryn stood before me..</p>

<p align=left>This was truely a sight to see, so many brothers Walaryn, organized in one location..an awe in itself.. </p>

<p align=left>Wyll describes the quite disturbing news from Useah to the crowd, and we head out to Brell's temple to seek out Wyndsor, The Walaryn's Uncle... </p>

<p align=left>I admit, at this point, I am serverly famished from my recent trip from Freeport, that when Wyndsor asks me to stay for dinner, I am almost reluctant to venture any further. And I'm STILL hungry writing this event into my diary!</p>

<p align=left>After Wyll almost pulling at me to leave, we head out to seek out "Wyzer" as he was called by both Wyndsor and the town locals. Upon arriving in Steamfont, the group searched far and wide for the crazy old man. Wyxle the Rogue Walaryn spotted him and the group finally gathered back together. This crazy old man was too hideous for me to even dare look in the face...Tried to stay far away from him as much as possible. Hopefully someone in the group payed attention, because my head was turned away during the entire encounter. The only thing I remember from this encounter was that he kept on repeating something about the Stone Bird will guide you. At this point, I really have my doubts as to whether this old coot is actually guiding us on the right path or leading us on a wild goose chase..</p>

<p align=left>Turns out there actually is a Stone Bird the ole coot was rambling on about. After running around getting lost with Wyloon in the lead, we arrive at the Stone Bird.</p>

<p align=left>At this point, we aren't sure if ole Wyzer was fibbing or pullin an ole prank, but no one knows what to do....I decided to try something, I get up on the stone bird statue and cast one of my illusion spells...blackness surrounds me....The next thing I remember is that I'm surrounded by the Walaryn group saying that Wyll went into some sort of fit or something 
....It's all been just too weird for me...I prey that Brell guides Wyll and his family along their way. Wyll is a true friend, and I'm sure he'll understand...but something as big as this..that they will have to do as a family, not with an "ojo"
