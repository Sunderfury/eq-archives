<p align=left><b>Troll's Folly</b><br><i>by Aanlain</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The day dawned quiet and still, birds singing in trees and the sounds of the animals going about their business. Amarin looked up from his journal to watch his friends break camp.</p>

<p align=left>“Oy! Where we off ta today?” he asked Sunmoon. Sunmoon looked up from putting out the small fire they had lit for the morning meal and shrugged. “ I found some indications that a troll is wandering the woods, as well as a party of human poachers, headed that way” he said pointing in the general direction of the desert which could be seen shimmering between the trees.</p>

<p align=left>The small band finished breaking camp and followed Sunmoon off into the trees. After a few minutes walking they could hear an argument in full swing. They moved closer, caution making their steps quiet. Confusion struck the party as it seemed a troll warrior was arguing with a huge misshapen tree.</p>

<p align=left>“Diz iz not da way tu du it stooped!” said the warrior.</p>

<p align=left>“Yes it iz, at least dat what dat hoomie druid tole me” said the tree.</p>

<p align=left>Hands on the hilts of their swords and curiosity in their eyes, the band moved out of the trees and into the clearing. “Ho there troll, why do you speak to the tree?” asked Sunmoon.</p>

<p align=left>As they moved closer they could see that it in fact was not the tree speaking, nor was it as misshapen as they took it. There stood a large troll with his arms wrapping the bole of the tree in a great hug. Closer inspection revealed that the two trolls were also members of the Lost Order. Hands slid from sword hilts and bow strings relaxed as the party approached.</p>

<p align=left>“Greetings brothers” said Amarin. The troll warrior snapped his hand to the Axe on this belt as the greeting was uttered and relaxed when he saw who approached. “Hey der Akalabethians” said the troll. “I be Skwazsh and diz be my brudder Skwizsh” he said.</p>

<p align=left>The other troll nodded to the party then continued to hug the tree. “Skwazsh is your brother in some trouble that we could assist with?” asked Sunmoon “Dunno he talked tu some hoomies dat wer kumin tru da forest and been huggin dat tree since den, he crazy Skwazsh tinks,” he lamented.</p>

<p align=left>Amarin approached the tree, as the rest of the party exchanged greetings and news with Swazsh. “Why is it that you hold the tree in a hug Skwizsh” he asked. Skwizsh rolled his eyes as he turned to look Amarin in the eye. “Yu more den anywun shud know what Skwizsh iz doing” he said.</p>

<p align=left>Puzzled, Amarin looked at the troll. “I am sorry Skwizsh I still don’t know what it is you are trying to accomplish” he said. Skwizsh shook his head and frowned. “Skwizsh know dat diz iz how tu bekum a druid, dem hoomies tole Skwizsh dat yu need tu hug treez, so dat wat Skwizsh iz doin” explained the troll.</p>

<p align=left>Amarin smiled a grin of understanding and motioned the troll off the tree. “Diz not da way?” Skwizsh asked. “No it is not good Skwizsh. Come with me and we shall talk a while about what it is to be a druid” Skwizsh resignedly let go of the tree as Amarin took him by the elbow and brought him to the clearing where the rest were gathered. The two sat and Amarin took a deep breath in preperation ………….</p>
