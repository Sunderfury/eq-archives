<p align=left>Captain's Log: Coldeve 27</p>

<p align=left>Time truely flies when yer havin' fun.  I've spent a good number of days in
Hebian-To and Shoushi.  Not a bad area, and the 'untings fine as could be.
The only thing I miss is the ale and stout.  These towns have some mighty
fine liquors that the locals call sake, and they are quite nice, but there's
just somethin' I miss about the good stouts to be found in the north lands.
I figure its just about time fer me to head back north to Rithwic and
perhaps Glenden Wood, and get me something better to drink.</p>

<p align=left>Today is nice enough fer the travelin' but I'd 'ate to walk all the bloody
way back to Rithwic this late in the day.  Mayhaps I'll give those
confounded portals another try, else I might see if I can get to the coast
and find me a ship that's headin' back north.</p>

<p align=left>Perhaps the fair bar wench here at Three Sword Hall can give me some hints
or pointers on how to get back 'ome.  They've been startin' to look at me
like I should get a move on again.  Mayhaps they're thinkin' I should put
the moves on.  Guess I'll find out sooner than later.</p>

<p align=left>Captain's Log: Coldeve 28</p>

<p align=left>I should warn the next 'undred people I meet not to mess with the ladies in
Shoushi.  Their skill, combined with me lake of it at the moment quite
nearly killed me last night.  Needless to say, they did want me to move on
as I'd drunk most of their sake.  They certianly did not want this sailor
makin' a pass at them.  So I head off towards the nearest portal I could
find, nursin' a sore head, and tryin' to out run the proprietor of the Three
Sword Hall so he couldn't run me though on that frog sticker he was wieldin'</p>

<p align=left>Well it just so 'appens that luck was with me tonight.  The portal I jumped
through took me all the way to Yanshi, 'most two thrids the ways to Rithwic.
Once I got me sences back I thought about findin' another portal, however
the queseness from the warned me that another portal jump would make me
return all that sake, and that t'would be a crime.</p>

<p align=left>That said, I found the nearest lifestone, shouldered me quiver of arrows and
set off to the north east. Unfortunatly, there was no road from Yanshi north
to Lytelthorpe.  Bein' in the mood fer a little trail blazin' I set off
anyway and made up me mind to find me own way, across the rollin' hills to
Lytelthorpe.</p>

<p align=left>T'was a most excitin' trip, which is good, if ye like that sorta thing.  Me
myself would have prefered a nice stroll through the rollin' hills.  However
as luck would have it, there are all sorts of beasties everywhere in this
area.  I counted mayhaps a half dozen armadillos and many more uglies along
the way.</p>

<p align=left>I'm proud to say that me bow skills are improving slowly.  I'm quite able to
take down most drudges from as far as 50 yards now.  This makes travelin'
much easier.  Still I found meself runnin' more than fightin' the mosters
along the path I choose fer meself.  Such is life, but I could almost smell
the ale flowin' from the kegs in Lytelthorpe.</p>

<p align=left>Took me most of the day but I finally made it to Lytelthorpe as dusk settled
in, and the evenin' rains started to fall.  The first thing I did when I
spied site of the town was to find the local pub.  The quality of the
Roasted Shreth was not what I was 'oping fer but it wasn't bad.  (which is
like sayin' roasted blood shreth on an empty stomach isn't bad)  My
foretunes were improvin' though.  Seems the fine barmaid, Selflora was
friendly type and all.  She shared much infermation about this towne and the
things around it.</p>

<p align=left>This towne has some interesting history to it.  Seems the place is an ole
Empyrean strong hold that has long been overrun with Banderlings.  Recently
the towne was liberated by a Lord Aleval, who now claims Lytelthorpe Keep as
his own.  More importantly I heard tell of an old Empyrean distilleery just
to the south of towne.  They say the place is full of drudges and shreths,
but they also say there might be some ole Empyrean vintage down there.  I
will have to do a wee bit o' explorin' tomorrow to find out for meself.  Fer
now I'm content to listen to the rain patter of the roof of the Roasted
Shreth fer a night.  After all the bed is warm and the ale good here.
