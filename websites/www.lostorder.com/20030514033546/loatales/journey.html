<p align=left><b>My Lonely Journey</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I sat at my desk listening to the sound of the gentle rain falling outside, letting my mind wander. Since I had left Britain, the city of my youth, for the last time I had been many places and done many things. After struggling in the wilds and oceans of Britannia to make a life for myself I found the posh comforts of the Lost Fleet Outpost somehow disturbing. </p>

<p align=left>I walked over to a nearby table where I had gathered the tools and items that had brought me to this place.</p>

<p align=left>-A battered spellbook: It had taken the very last of my inheritance to purchace this book, small pile of reagents and the first few scrolls that started my carrer.<br>
-A rusty and chipped katana: It was this sword and the hides and meat I gathered with it that purchaced the Bloodwake and take to the seas.<br>
-A claim ticket for the Bloodwake: The ship that rook me to the ends of the world, a shattered remnant of her former glory.<br>
-A sewing kit: Tailoring had given me the finatial freedom to purchace a fine house, contribute to the fleet and practice the magical arts. The Intrepid and Independace are products of my industrious tailoring.<br>
-A hammer and nails: For a brief time I worked under Master Akira building furnature for the Lost Fleet house umong other projects.<br>
-A set of tinker's tools: With these I supplied the fleet with sextants and time pieces to aid new sailors in navigation.<br>
-A quill and vile of ink: These I carefuly used to create scrolls and copy my spell book.</p>

<p align=left>Lastly a crossbow and an ax, these last two items I place carfuly in my pack, next to a new spell book and small pile of reagents. I walk out the door and head for the Intrepid, which lays in anchor nearby. I hoist the anchor aboard and unfurl the sail. I take hold of the tiller and pilot the Intrepid silently out of the harbor and into the deep ocean. I sail away, not knowing and not caring where I go and when i will return. </p>

<p align=left>Without looking back I sail out to sea, as the gental rain washes my soul clean and floods my mind with peace.</p>
