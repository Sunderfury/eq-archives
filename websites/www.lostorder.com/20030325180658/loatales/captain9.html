<p align=left>Captain's Log: Morningthaw 1</p>

<p align=left>Another very busy and profitable two days fer me.  Things were going very
well fer me in Lytelthorpe.  I've been making a good number of raids into
the lost distillary, and it was proving to be very profitable.  My skills
with the bow are returning, slowly, but surely.  I would have liked to stay
in towne fer a few more days perhaps, but there was that little matter of
Selfora.  There was something that she wasn't tellin' me, though I found out
the hard way.  I managed to jump into the Rithwic portal just in time, and
with a little help from the flat side of her husband's ax head.  Lucky fer
me it was the flat side or there might be two of me writin' this tale.</p>

<p align=left>Still apart from me wounded pride, and sober demeaner, I decided to make the
best of it.  After all its been a month or so already and I was sure the cur
at the Skull and Flagons has fergotten about me tab already.  Well at least
I would have fergotten, seems the cur behind the bar didn't.  After I
brushed the dirt from the road off me face and armor, I opted to head fer
the Royal Firkin again.  In me short time in Rithwic, Ricetha seemed more
than friendly to an ole sailor anyway.</p>

<p align=left>Still after gettin' shown the door twice today I wanted to go out and turn
something into a pin cushion.  Ricetha told be about the ole abandonded
warehouse just south of town.  I figured that was as good a place as any to
bash some skulls in and releave some tension.  She was right, the plae was
right up me alley.  The warehouse was full of those ilegidamate sons of an
alley cat, drudges.  They were everywhere.  Sharpenin' their claws on all
the discarded furnature and usin' young advetures as chew toys.</p>

<p align=left>I ran out of arrows not one, not twice, but three times in my adventuring
today.  Trothyd Fletcher was right, if you run out of arrows ye run.  Still
I managed to go back to the Royal Firkin tonight with more than a couple
scars and a pair of trade notes.  T'was a great evenin' adventure.</p>

<p align=left>Just as I was about to settle in with Ricetha, and enjoy a nice stout, I
recieved word that Greyhawk and managed te get pulled through the portals
from Norath.  Well I sent the messager boy to go bring him in so I could
help him get adjusted, and get him a good ale and all.  We chated fer a bit,
the decided to hit the warehouse together fer a peice.</p>

<p align=left>About this time I suddenly felt extreamly fatigued.  I'm startin' to suspect
that Ricetha put something in me ale, but who knows.  I decieded that I
should call it a night before I got meself killed (again) in that bloody
drudge hole.</p>

<p align=left>I hear tell that the lost order's going to be gathering again soon.  If I
hear more it looks like I might be makin' another long trip 'cross the
bloody island.  I just hope I don't have to jump though any more portals
this week, they always make me sick...
