<p align=left><b>Lost At Sea, Part Three</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The Intrepid lay at anchor in Everlight harbor, her tillerman Sciurus was busying himself with the day to day chores of keeping the venerable ship seaworthy.   Sciurus keep busy even though his captain, Enosh, had been missing for some time.  He had heard from the admiral that Enosh went down with his ship, and that he was possibly stranded on a desolate island.  Sciurus for one hoped his captain made a swift return, especially since he was running out of money for ale.</p>

<p align=left>Just as Sciurus was about to head off to Moonglow to drink away the last of his savings, he saw the shell of a man limping toward the ship.  He stood still a moment, not sure whether he should pity or fear the figure, who's tattered cloths and sunken eyes looked more like those of a corpse than of a living person.  Sciurus decided that it would be better to head to the tavern than to stick around and find out if the creature coming towards him was friend or foe.  With all speed Sciurus ran of towards Moonglow, seeking a stout ale and a warm wench.</p>

<p align=left>Enosh watched his tillerman run off towards town.  "I must look like death washed ashore" Enosh thought to himself.  "Maybe all I need is a bit more rest, then off to Moonglow tomorrow." he said to himself as he climbed aboard the intrepid.  Enosh then slumped down and leaned against the mast of the Intrepid and drifted off to sleep.</p>
