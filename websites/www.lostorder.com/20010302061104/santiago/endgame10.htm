<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"></font><font size="4"><font color="#0080C0">King
Kazon Stormhammer was miserable.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He did not like
outsiders. The humans were tall, smelly and rude. The elves were too damn happy all the
time. And the gnomes&#133;he didn&#146;t even want to think about the gnomes.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">But now his audience
hall was full of these outsiders. They had traveled great distances to come here, though
Kazon wished that they would have stayed at home where they belonged.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Just when he thought
it couldn&#146;t get any worse, one of the elves began to play a song on his lute. The
king was about to order his immediate execution, but one of the other elves seized the
instrument and threw it across the hall.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The king&#146;s
herald entered the chamber, followed closely by Bierfreund and the tallest human that
Kazon had ever seen. Bierfreund approached the throne and bowed deeply. The barbarian
followed suit, though his attempt at a bow was clumsy and awkward. Kazon nodded curtly at
both of them, and they rose and retreated back into the crowd.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Everyone shut
up now,&quot; said the king. The room became silent.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;If you
haven&#146;t heard the rumors, then you&#146;ve either been asleep or dead. There&#146;s
trouble coming&#133;big trouble. Ralineth, fill them in.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The hall was filled
with whispering as a shadowy figure stepped forward from the shadows.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Some of you
know me,&quot; said the archdruid. &quot;Many do not. I am a guardian of the land. I have
set myself to the task of protecting the Faydark from those who seek to disrupt the
natural order of things. To this end, I have brought all of you here this night. I have
learned of a threat to our realm, the single greatest threat this world has ever
known.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You
mean&#133;we&#146;re out of ale?&quot; Kherghon said, growing pale.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;No,&quot; said
Ralineth. &quot;Worse than that.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Don&#146;t see
how things could get worse than that,&quot; muttered Walterus.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;The goblins are
plotting to destroy the world,&quot; said the druid.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Goblins?&quot;
laughed Dargo the dwarf. &quot;I chops them with me axe! I eats them fer breakfast!
Goblins ain&#146;t no threat.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Normally, I
would agree with you,&quot; said the druid calmly. &quot;But these goblins have discovered
something which makes them very dangerous. They have in their possession a dragon egg, in
which lies one of Veeshan&#146;s brood.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Who&#146;s
Veeshan?&quot; asked Bierfreund.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Bloody big
dragon,&quot; whispered Kherghon.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;The goblin
shamans are preparing a dark spell,&quot; continued Ralineth. &quot;At midnight tonight,
the egg will hatch, and a new dragon will be born. As a result of the goblin magic, the
new dragon will quickly grow to such a size that our very world will seem small in
comparison. The goblins are insanely fanatical; they believe that this dragon will favor
them, and grant them power over all their enemies.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Fine,&quot;
said the king. &quot;I&#146;ll send an army, and put all the goblins to death.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Ralineth shook his
head. &quot;The goblins have posted scouts on all the roads. An army would be detected,
and the goblins would have time to evacuate their camp and move the egg elsewhere. What we
need is a small band &#150; about a dozen or so &#150; to assault the camp and put an end
to their insane plan.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Kazon stood up and
approached the assembly. &quot;So what we need here is some volunteers. That means you
step forward and volunteer before I have you executed.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">From the dwarves,
Walterus, Kherghon, Dargo and Morgf stepped forward.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">From the elves,
Kileyan, Jarlaxle and Penaden stepped forward.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">From the humans,
Greyhawk, Rothan and Eshay stepped forward.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;We&#146;re
gettin&#146; paid for this, right?&quot; asked Bierfreund, who had brazenly propped
himself up on the throne.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You have about
two seconds to get off my throne before I chop you in half,&quot; said Kazon, hefting his
axe in one hand. Bierfreund grinned mischievously and scurried into the crowd.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Now get out of
here, the lot of you!&quot; roared the king. &quot;Don&#146;t come back until you&#146;ve
killed every single goblin in the Butcherbloks!&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The king watched the
motley crowd depart. &quot;We&#146;re doomed, aren&#146;t we?&quot; he asked the druid.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Pretty
much,&quot; said Ralineth.</font></font></p>
