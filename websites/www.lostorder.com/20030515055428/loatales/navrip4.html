<p align=left><b>Into The Night, Part Two</b><br><i>by Navrip</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Trumpets blared out over the courtyard of the keep. The soldiers and guards rushed all over the place, vying for their proper positions and posts. Today was an important day. The general’s personal lieutenant was coming to inspect the garrison. Everyone wanted to make the best impressions and hope for a promotion.</p>

<p align=left>Privates Hartac and Kyros stood next to each other in their file. The two were friends privately, though the general did not approve of his soldiers getting close to one another. He felt that emotional attachments to others made you weak, especially in combat. But the two nudged each other with excitement and the prospect of a good review.</p>

<p align=left>When Lieutenant General Embros came upon their section, they stood the straightest, had their armor polished the brightest, and flinched the least. The lieutenant nodded approvingly at the two then continued his walk. As soon as he couldn’t see them, Hartac started grinning and tapped Kyros on the shoulder. They started whispering to each other, so Embros couldn’t hear them.</p>

<p align=left>“You!” a strong, gruff voice called out. The two privates went pale in fright. Everyone knew that voice. Everyone feared it. “You two,” Embros called out again. “You two are talking to each other?”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes sir!” Kyros replied. “We were sir!” </p>

<p align=left>Embros walked closer to them, bent slightly at the waist, and scrutinized the two. “Why were you doing that Private?” he asked.</p>

<p align=left>“We were merely discussing the progress of the inspection sir!” Kyros told him. </p>

<p align=left>Embros stood straight and frowned. “And why,” he began to ask, “did you choose each other to speak with of all the others around you? Surely, that corporal would have been equipped with better knowledge to discuss inspection procedure. Perhaps you two are friends?”</p>

<p align=left>A line of sweat began to bead on Kyros’s forehead under the scrutiny of Embros. The casual and uncaring tone of the man unnerved him. Hartac felt sorry for him. He wished he could step in, but doing so would only compound problems. “Friends sir? Nay, we are not friends. It was merely coincidence that I chose to speak with him.”</p>

<p align=left>Embros nodded slightly. “I see,” he said. “Well, then, I suppose I should be continuing with the inspection.” Embros turned around and Kyros breathed a sigh of release. Suddenly, Embros whirled around and caught Kyros across the jaw with a wicked backhand.</p>

<p align=left>“You are lying!” Embros snarled. “Do you know what General Navrip does to those who lie to him?” he asked. Kyros whimpered on the ground, afraid to answer for fear of further attack, yet not wanting to sit there as if he were dumb. “Stand up!” Embros ordered. Kyros leapt to his feet. Embros looked ready to strike him again.</p>

<p align=left>“Sir, please…” Hartac said, before he knew what he was doing. </p>

<p align=left>“Ah ha, so the ‘friend’ speaks!” Embros said, with a wicked gleam in his eyes. “You know the policy on friendship. It leads to weakness and betrayal. We tolerate none of that! Do you understand?”</p>

<p align=left>“Sir, yes sir!” Kyros said.</p>

<p align=left>“I do,” Hartac merely responded. </p>

<p align=left>Embros chuckled to himself. “You do? Really? Well then, prove that you are not weak.”</p>

<p align=left>Hartac stood there silently, waiting for a further order from Embros. When none came, he said, “Prove it sir?”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes,” Embros said, stepping back as if he was trying to view something better. “My primary mission here was to reward the strong and punish the weak. Since you two lowered yourself to the level of weakness, you must prove you are strong. I order you two to duel here, to the death. The winner gets promoted to corporal. The loser dies.”</p>

<p align=left>Hartac and Kyros were dumbfounded. Embros snapped his fingers and his archers trained their arrows on us. “Do it now,” Embros said, “or you both die.” </p>

<p align=left>Kyros numbly drew his weapon. He took a combative stance and nodded to Hartac, who stood there unmoving. “Draw your weapon,” Kyros said in a shaky voice. “Do it now.”</p>

<p align=left>“Kyros,” Hartac whispered. “Don’t do this…” </p>

<p align=left>Kyros closed his eyes and swallowed hard. He opened his eyes again and repeated, this time in a stronger voice, “Draw your weapon before I kill you in cold blood.”</p>

<p align=left>Hartac just stood there unmoving. Shock and horror were on his face as his friend threatened to kill him. “Please don’t,” Hartac muttered. Kyros’s blade flashed and found it’s point on the tip of Hartac’s adam’s apple.</p>

<p align=left>“Do it now,” Kyros ordered.</p>

<p align=left>“Kill me then,” Hartac said, pain in his eyes. Kyros sighed deeply and shut his eyes again, trying to find some inner strength and resolve. He restored his sight and stared once more into his friend’s face.</p>

<p align=left>“No!” Kyros said, spinning around and facing Embros. “I won’t do this! It’s wroaagh~” Kyros’s words degenerated into a gurgle as blood flowed into his throat. He reached up and touched the sword point sticking through his neck one time before collapsing to the ground. </p>

<p align=left>Embros looked up approvingly at Hartac, who stood over the body of his dead friend, an evil grin on his face. “Very well done,” Embros said. “You killed him easily, you did. Didn’t even break a sweat, just stabbed him while his back was turned.”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye sir,” Hartac said. “I did it because I’m not weak!”</p>

<p align=left>Embros’s eyebrow raised. “Oh, you aren’t?” He chuckled. “Such strength it took to kill a man in cold blood. Such strength it took to ram your sword through his back. Such strength it took to pull the blade from his body!” Embros chuckled again and put his hand on the bridge of his nose.</p>

<p align=left>“What do you mean sir?” Hartac asked, confused.</p>

<p align=left>Embros looked up and smiled at him. “Guards, capture that private. He is to be executed for dishonor in combat and treason. If he can’t be loyal to his friend, he won’t be loyal to the Disciples in the future, now will he?”</p>

<p align=left>Hartac yelled and screamed in horror as the guards fell upon him and beat him into senselessness. The last thing he remembered was seeing Kyros’s dead eyes staring into his own.</p>
