<p align=left><b>A Long Night At Sea</b><br><i>by Enosh Flam</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Under overcast skies in the early evening I piloted the Bloodwake out of Moonglow harbor.  After my recent "adventures" in the dungeon Shame I longed for the open sea once again.  Here I knew the dangers and how to deal with them.  Here I felt confident in my own abilities, unlike the cramped claustrophobic dungeons.  The winds were blowing from the south west this evening, bringing with it the threat of rain.  However my course would take me to the north west, to the city of Minoc.  I hoped this course would help me avoid the brunt of the storm.</p>

<p align=left>As night fell and I rounded the north tip of Ice Island, the winds grew stronger and it began to snow.  The bitter cold wind began to stir the sea into a foaming cauldron.  Twenty foot waves began to batter the Bloodwake as I continued to press onward to the northwest.</p>

<p align=left>I walked along the pitching deck shouting my orders to the tiller man just to be heard above the wind and waves.  Looking out from the bow of the 'Wake just as she reached the crest of a wave, what I saw ahead chilled my soul more than the bitter wind and cold snow.  Ahead the largest serpent that ever terrorized the seas of Britannia was cutting its way through the waves, heading strait for the 'Wake.</p>

<p align=left>I shouted "Hard to Port!" at the top of my lungs.  Fighting a serpent that big is challenging enough, fighting it and the sea at the same time was more than even I could handle.  As the ship began to turn, and I made my way back to the tiller, a great wave struck the 'Wake broadside, nearly washing me overboard.  I struggled to my feet, only to find that my tiller man was gone, claimed by the sea.</p>

<p align=left>I hurried to the stern and fought to take control of the ship myself.  With all my strength I fought against the sea.  Suddenly I was knocked to the deck as the whole ship shook.  The great serpents head burst from the water just off the starboard side.  Forgetting the tiller I grabbed my sack of reagents and unleashed a bolt of lighting upon the foul beast.  It responded by lashing out against the side of the 'Wake, crashing into the hull and sending wooden shrapnel everywhere.  I screamed "Corp Por!" provoking a howl of pain for the monster.  Again I sent a bolt of energy into the foul serpent.  In its blind rage it knocked me aside with it monstrous head, goring me badly on its vile horns.  Exhausted and choking on my own blood and gore, I summoned all the fires of Hades. My last spell caused the air around the serpent to explode in flames, sucking the breath of life from its vile form.  With a horrible cry that I shall not soon forget the vile beast expired, its body crashing down onto the 'Wake.  The deck gave way to under the force of the monster's body, and the wake was nearly split in half.</p>

<p align=left>Bleeding freely from several deep gouges I dragged myself back to the tiller and turned the ship back to the south.  I fought the wind and waves, desperately attempting to drag the badly damaged Bloodwake back to Moonglow harbor and the safety of her sheltered harbor.  Off on the horizon I could see the end of the storm.  This wonderful sight lifted my spirit, but my elation was short lived.  A strong gust of wind hit the 'Wake.  The last sound I heard was a sickening wet snap before my world went black.</p>

<p align=left>I awoke some time later, pinned to the deck by the top half of the mast.  The sun was shinning and a gentle wind blew over the calm sea.  I freed myself from the remnant of the mast.  After working a little healing magic upon myself I surveyed the damage.  The 'Wake's mast was snapped in half, the deck forward of the mast was obliterated.  The corpse of the serpent was charred and floating in what remained of the hold.  Her Starboard hull was badly cracked letting the sea slowly seep in.  Listing 30 degrees starboard, the Bloodwake made for a very sad sight indeed.  I summoned the powers of telekinesis to begin to return the sea to its proper place and prevent the 'Wake from sinking.  I then set about affixing a makeshift sail to the broken mast.</p>

<p align=left>Many uncounted hours later the Bloodwake and I were once again docked safely in Moonglow harbor.  She's now in dry dock, where she will be repaired.  Her keel is sound although her hull and deck will take more than minor repairs.  I will spend my free time lovingly piecing her back together, board by board.  Repairing the 'Wake will be a labor of love.  She has served me well for a long time, and I cannot allow the sea to claim her if I can prevent it.</p>

<p align=left>Until the Bloodwake is sea worthy again, I shall continue my duties in the Navy at the helm of the Intrepid.  Although she hasn't been given a proper sea trial yet, she should server me and the navy very well indeed.</p>

<p align=left>On a lighter note, I have another, albeit blackened, trophy for the walls of Fleet headquarters.</p>
