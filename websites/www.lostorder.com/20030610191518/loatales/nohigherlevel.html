<p align=left><b>No Higher Level</b><br><i>by Orbison</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Well the warior may battle on, just to raise his skill<br>
Always looking for new monsters and another kill<br>
The magician risks his life and limb and sojourns into hell<br>
Seeking out arcane components for another spell</p>

<p align=left>The enchanter goes out into the wilderness, risking deadly harm<br>
Looking for monsters to ensnare with his subtle charm<br>
Yet all these classes in their struggle to be masters of their art<br>
Have forgotten there's no higher level than the one within their heart</p>

<p align=left>There's no higher level, and I thank the gods above<br>
There's no higher level, than to know, and be in love<br>
When two souls share this glorious bond<br>
There is nothing that can stand in their way<br>
No skill or spell or shiny armor <br>
Is more rewarding at the end of the day</p>

<p align=left>Well, the necromancers and the shadow knights fill their foes with dread<br>
Seeking to increase their power just to raise the dead<br>
The druids and rangers live in peace with their woodland friends<br>
Acquiring skills and spells alike as a means to that end</p>

<p align=left>And clerics travel all around, welcomed to all groups<br>
Practicing their healing arts on weary, beaten troops<br>
And bards are silly, as we all know, plucking on their strings<br>
But this one knows of no higher level than the one of which he sings</p>

<p align=left>There's no higher level, that I have ever known of<br>
There's no higher level, than to know, and be in love<br>
When two souls share this glorious bond<br>
Let all the heavens quake<br>
What else could cause a barbarian heart<br>
To tremble and to shake?</p>

<p align=left>Well, the monks will battle endlessly, just to get their kicks<br>
Picking up along the way new and deadly tricks<br>
And rogues gain many useful skills as they sneak around<br>
Like poisoning and backstabbing to bring their enemies down</p>

<p align=left>The wizards travel near and far seeking arcane lore<br>
Recovering long forgotten spells, and always seeking more<br>
And paladins and shamans, well they each have their special quest<br>
But there still is not a higher level to which I know I can attest</p>

<p align=left>There's no higher level, and I thank the gods above<br>
There's no higher level, than to know, and be in love<br>
When two souls share this glorious bond<br>
There is nothing that can stand in their way<br>
For just one day to feel like that<br>
I'd throw all my platinum away</p>

<p align=left>No skill or spell or numerical stat<br>
Is more rewarding or special than that<br>
No loot off a monster that you camp all night<br>
Can make you feel more alive with light</p>

<p align=left>There's no higher level, now EVERYONE SING ALONG!<br>
There's no higher level, cause you know that I'm not wrong<br>
There's no higher level, and I thank the gods above <br>
There's no higher level, than to know and be in love</p>

<p align=left>There's no higher level<br>
There's no higher level</p>

<p align=left>(repeat until audience passes out..hehe)</p>
