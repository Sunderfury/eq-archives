<p align=left><b>As You Commanded.....</b><br><i>by unknown</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Most Powerful Mistress,</p>

<p align=left>As you commanded I began my search for those Walayrn gnomes. I caught up to them in Steamfront. I heard that Wyzer say the stone bird and I knew exactly what he meant so I went off to where they would be going. You were right, dear mistress, they are not smart. I had to wait a full day and half the night before they arrived but they finally came. </p>

<p align=left>That stone bird spoke though Wyll. </p>

<p align=left>Using the powers you gave me I was able to get close and hear what they were saying. Sentimental gnomes were more concerned with the health of Wyll than figuring out what was said. </p>

<p align=left>They made their way to Felwithe and are spending the night at the inn. Stupid gnomes… they do not know I watch them as they sleep. </p>

<p align=left>Your Humble Servant</p>
