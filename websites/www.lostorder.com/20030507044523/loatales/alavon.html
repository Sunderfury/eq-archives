<p align=left><b>A Leave of the Past</b><br><i>by Alavon Highwind</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>"Faster.  Faster.  Lungs hurt, legs ache.  Faster.  Faster still."  A 
figure bursts through the dense woods of Moonglow, the glow of torchlight 
behind him.  The angery shouts of men can be heard clearly throughout the 
night sky.  The young man continues to run, stumbling from time to time on 
the rough terrain, but always moving.  We can see the fear in his eyes.  He 
runs a race that none envy, for if he slows down, he will lose not only the 
game, but his life.  A game, that is how they treat him.  He is nothing but 
sport.  They've hunted this child for seventeen years, and they can smell 
the blood.  They feel the game is nearly finished, and this pushes them on 
all the more.  But why do they chase this boy of innocence.  He has many 
times asked himself this, but he knew the answer.  He just didn't accept it.</p>

<p align=left>Alavon Highwind was born unto a couple that was looked down upon by the 
people of Moonglow.  The mother, Nariana, was a simple woman with a true 
heart.  The father, Alwith, an elf of great magic power.  The mages feared 
his power, despite Alwiths good nature and helping spirit.  They saw this 
opportunity as the way to banish him, his "corruption" of a village woman.  
They wasted no time, and accused him of evil deeds.  Alwith was speechless, 
and his lack of response was all the mages needed to win the town to their 
side of the charge.  The mages summoned a portal to the Abyss, and forcibly 
threw Alwith into its cold embrace.  Alwith's last known words were pleas to 
leave his wife and child be.  This last request fell on deaf ears, as the 
angry mob soon turned to Nariana and her infant son, Alavon.  The crowd drew 
around them, with the mages leading the advance toward them, with evil 
glares in their eyes.  Nariana begged for her childs life, but there was no 
mercy in their souls.  The mages, fearing that Alavon may be as strong as 
his father in time, was their main concern.  Together, they congured a 
spell, stealing all magic ablilities from the young boy.  As the mob grew 
closer still, Narianas brother and father pushed men aside, making a path 
for Nariana to run through.  She ran faster than ever before, and rushed 
young Alavon to safety.  Her families fate was sealed, but Nariana and 
Alavon were safe for the time being, hiding in the woods of Moonglow.</p>

<p align=left>A man jumps from inside a house, tackling the running figure.  The two 
struggle briefly, and in this struggle the blade of Alavon pierces the man, 
injuring him badly.  Alavon looks stunned for a moment, but instincts take 
over, and off he runs again.  He slips through the trees like only a wood 
elf could, knowing every knoll and branch.  The crowd begins to fade into 
the distance, but he knows that they will find him.  He has escaped but one 
hunting party.  Several more walk the island.  This will most certainly be 
the night of his demise....   Alavon comes to a clearing.  He stops dead in 
his tracks, a vision of his past coming to life again.  A past he wished he 
could forget....</p>

<p align=left>It has been six years since Alwiths banishment, six years of hiding.  The 
men chase Nariana as she carries her son.  Nariana has grown older, and can 
no longer run as well as she once could.  She senses that she will not 
escape this time, and gives all the effort she has left in her being to pull 
away from her pursuers for just a few moments.  She hides Alavon in the 
brush, and tells him to be quiet.  Alavon, ever obedient, obeys.  Nariana 
runs a few feet, and then moves no more.  Her race is lost.  Only one is 
left, and he is helpless.  That was eleven years ago, and this "helpless" 
child may finally be at the end of his race.  The game is nearly over.</p>

<p align=left>Alavon has been running for nearly three hours now.  His heart is near 
exhaustion, his legs have lost feeling, and his mind has become cloudy with 
exhertion.  He hears the men coming from all sides.  He is trapped.  He 
vainly attempts to find a gap in their web of men, but fails.  He is beaten.  After seventeen years of being hunted, the hare will finally be caught.  
Alavon falls on his knees and calls out his fathers name with the last of 
his breath.  He falls to the ground, and remembers no more.....</p>

<p align=left>His eyes open, the light burning his mind.  His head is throbbing, and his 
body feels as if it has been destoyed.  But yet he lives.  He is in a 
forest, but it is no forest he has ever seen.  He slowly gets up, the effort 
causing him more pain than he ever felt.  He wanders through the wood, 
trying to gather what has happened.  He sees a clearing in the trees, with 
buildings unlike he has ever seen.  Cautiously he makes his way out of the 
woods and brush, and sees a man standing in the center of the village.  
"Welcome to the Lost Order friend!"  Bewildered and exhausted, he stands 
there, unknowing what to do.  "Fitting," thinks Alavon, "A lost soul finding 
a Lost Order."  In the breeze of the trees, Alavon swears he hears a voice, 
the voice of his father.  "Good-bye, Son."  The last gift of a loving father.  
Freedom.
