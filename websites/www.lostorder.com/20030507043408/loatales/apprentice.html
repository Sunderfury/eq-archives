<p align=left><b>Enter The Apprentice</b><br><i>by anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A small girl sat on the ground gently rocking back and forth. Her mother came up from behind the barn and saw her sitting there. Her mother could tell something was not right, she noticed that her daughter's shoulders were shaking as she rocked. As the girl's mother drew nearer, she began to hear quiet sobbing from the girl. Her mother called out to her daughter but there was no answer save for the soft sighs and whimpering. The girl's mother hurried over to see that her daughter clutched in her arms her favorite puppy. The woman gasped, clapped her hand over her mouth and dropped to her knees and held her daughter close. She understood now why her daughter wept so. The poor creature, almost spilling out of he daughter's arms, had been near ripped apart. The little girl loved her puppy so very much she clung to it and held it so tightly as if hoping she could hug life back into its body. With pitiful helplessness in her eyes, the girl looked at her mother and simply said, "Please momma, can you make him all-better?" With that, the girl's mother broke into tears as well and tried to tell her innocent little girl how sorry she was that she couldn't, that they should make a small bed for the puppy in the ground and let him sleep. </p>

<p align=left>Watching the emotional scene with bemused interest from the hayloft above, was a boy of about twelve years. He was most curious about the happenings below, as he had been the 'father' of them. Keeping himself hidden, he watched on and mused to himself. </p>

<p align=left>"Hmm, interesting. I didn't think Alairan's mother would be sad and cry too. I will have to ask Tanzenier about it." </p>

<p align=left>The boy watched the mother coax her daughter up off the ground and over to the well, where she tried to clean some of the bloody mess from her daughter's clothes. Feeling that there was nothing more to learn from this experiment, the boy silently climbed down from the loft and snuck out of the barn, crept to the fence and made his way into the nearby woods. As he put more distance between himself and the farm, he thought over and over again about this latest experiment his mentor had sent him to complete and learn from. </p>

<p align=left>"Now remember boy, death is not about emotion. Death is merely the entrance to another state of being and a change in one's physical sate. Just as the hunter knows he must not feel sorrow for the hind he kills, so must you never feel sorrow or remorse for that which you kill. If you allow emotion to intertwine with purpose, you allow weakness and doubt into you. This will make you hesitate, and in this world hesitation is equal to death. So remember, you must never allow pity, remorse, fear or even anger to cloud your purpose where killing is concerned." </p>

<p align=left>His mentor, Tanzenier, had already taught him so much about how to hide in the slightest of shadows and how to move quietly as the evening breeze. Only recently had he begun to teach his eager and devoted young pupil the principles of killing. </p>

<p align=left>"Now to begin the training that will make you a truly valuable asset. You must begin small. Practice on birds and rabbits, then try larger animals such as the wild pigs that roam. When you are ready and strong enough, you can then practice on things like deer and wild cats." </p>

<p align=left>The boy thought about the various techniques he had been taught. Each lesson Tanzenier showed a different method for taking the life from another living creature. Each new method was slightly more refined and precise. Tanzenier had said that precision was very important, for "precision led to efficiency", and efficient precise killing was a valuable thing, if not necessary to one's survival. Before he knew it, the boy found himself at the entrance to his mentor's den. Knowing of the traps that Tanzenier had set for the overly curious unwanted visitor, the boy entered by way of the secret passage that actually began in the tool shed. Once he had made his way through the tunnel and into the actual house, he walked to the main room eagerly seeking the counsel of his teacher. Three steps into the room, he was knocked to the floor from behind. The boy recovered remarkably quickly for one so young, and did a tuck roll to the far side of the room where he sprung to his feet to face his attacker. Before him stood a thin rail of a man wearing only a pair of hose and a dark baleful smile. </p>

<p align=left>"How many times have I told you, boy, you must never be caught unawares when you enter a room?" the tone in the man's voice soft yet rich and so sickeningly sinister as would cause most to freeze in panicked terror. </p>

<p align=left>"I know Master Tanzenier, I am sorry. I promise I will not forget again." The boy knew exactly who his attacker had been before he had even stood up from his roll across the room. </p>

<p align=left>"See that you don't, boy. Otherwise, next time you will not have the chance to apologize." </p>

<p align=left>The boy nodded and bowed his head. His master was not cruel. This was simply his way. His way of making certain the boy learned what he needed to. The boy knew that his master truly cared for him, but if he did not learn what his master had to teach, he would end up dead and then his master would have no pupil. When Tanzenier spoke again, his voice had completely changed to a tone more befitting a father who was happy to see his son. </p>

<p align=left>"Now, what is it that is so important as to distracted you enough to cause you to forget one of the most basic rules of survival?" Tanzenier pulled a shirt from somewhere, put it on and took a seat in a large cushioned chair. </p>

<p align=left>"Well, you know the experiment you wanted me to do today, " the boy began as he sat on the floor in front of his master. </p>

<p align=left>"Yes, did you complete it?" </p>

<p align=left>"Yes, I did. But…" Tanzenier cut him short, as he often did. </p>

<p align=left>"And what did you learn from it?" Tanzenier asked as he closed his eyes. </p>

<p align=left>"Well, I don't really know. I mean I don't really know what it was I was supposed to learn. In most all of the other lessons and things I knew all along what I was supposed to be learning." The boy folded his knees up into his chest and held them tightly. He didn't like when he couldn't understand something or felt stupid about something. Resting his chin upon his knees, he continued. "I am sorry that I do not understand. I tried to think about it the whole time I was walking back here, but I just couldn't figure it out. I'm sorry." The boy did so hate to disappoint his master. He stared at the floor and waited for his master to express his disappointment. </p>

<p align=left>Tanzenier opened his eyes and smiled at his confused student. "Do not overly concern yourself. Today's lesson was not about technique or style. Today was about something completely different. Before I explain any further, I want you to describe exactly where you went and what you did." </p>

<p align=left>The boy proceeded to recount the story of how he had chosen the place and subject that he had. He also described in great detail the stalking of his subject and how he had disemboweled the puppy without allowing it to make a single sound, so as to illustrate to his master how he had learned what had been taught. Tanzenier could here the pride in the boy's voice and favored with a smile as he listened to the tale. Tanzenier was in fact somewhat proud, himself, of his pupil. The boy finished his tale with the ambush that had taken place not an hour ago in the very room they sat in. He looked at Tanzenier expectantly. Tanzenier sat up and rested an elbow on one arm of the chair. </p>

<p align=left>"Very good boy. You have learned well, the methods I have taught you. However, as I said, today's lesson was not about method. Now that you have told me what you did and how, tell me what it is that you do not understand. You said that you were surprised the little girl's mother cried too. Why were you surprised?" Tanzenier tilted his head to one side, waiting for an answer he already knew. </p>

<p align=left>"Well," started the boy, "I just didn't think she would get so sad and cry. The puppy was not hers, it belonged to the little girl. I knew the little girl would cry. Is that what today's lesson was about, how to make other people cry?" The boy hated sounding stupid in front of his master. Tanzenier smiled again. "In a way, yes. However today's lesson was about something much greater." Tanzenier leaned forward, bringing his face closer to his student's, and gazed deeply into the boy's eyes. "Today's lesson was about power." He said in a chillingly sinister voice. </p>

<p align=left>"Power? What kind of power? Please forgive my stupidity master, but I still don't understand." </p>

<p align=left>Tanzenier stood up and crossed to the fireplace without looking at the boy or saying a word. The boy grew tenser by the moment, fearing that he had raised his master's wrath. Tanzenier slowly turned to the boy and stared at him with such cold emotionless eyes as only the dead have. </p>

<p align=left>"Tell me what you are feeling boy." Tanzenier's voice as cold as his stare. "Remember I will know if you lie." </p>

<p align=left>"I…" the boy stammered, "I am afraid." he whispered sheepishly. </p>

<p align=left>Suddenly a change came across Tanzenier's face and form like a retreating shadow. He again looked like the mentor the boy had always known. </p>

<p align=left>"That kind of power boy." He said excitedly. "The kind of power that takes on a life of it's own and attacks almost imperceptibly in such a way that most people will never realize they are being laid siege to. Today you saw how deeply affecting the power of sorrow and grief can be. You did not ever count the mother as possibly being among the subjects of today's lesson, yet that is exactly what she was. You see, boy," Tanzenier crouched down next to the rapt boy, "your subject is not necessarily the person or thing you kill." Tanzenier watched his pupil as the light of realization worked its way to the boy's eyes. "Do you understand now?" </p>

<p align=left>The boy felt as if he had just been infused with the very essence of truth. He looked at his master with an expression of tremendous gratefulness. "Yes, I understand. Thank you master." </p>

<p align=left>Tanzenier stood up, "Good, now make ready for bed. The hour is late and tomorrow I teach you of the preparation and use of poisons. You have learned so very quickly all else I have shown you, I am certain you will find this quite easy as well. Now, down to your room ad to bed with you." </p>

<p align=left>The boy stood and walked to the edge of the room where he paused for a moment and turned to his teacher. "Master, may I ask a question?" the boy asked hesitantly. </p>

<p align=left>"Of course." Tanzenier was putting out the fire for the night. </p>

<p align=left>"When can I have a name? </p>

<p align=left>Tanzenier stopped what he was doing and looked up at the boy. "When you are able to survive on your own. When the training I give you can teach you no more. I understand your desire. Believe me though, the day may come when you will wish to be as anonymous and unknown as you are now. Now hurry to bed, I'll not tell you another time." He turned his attention back to the dying fire. The boy turned and did as his master said, and tried to think of the new lessons that tomorrow held instead of his lack of a name and identity.</p>
