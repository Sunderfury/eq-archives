<p align=left>*begins to write*</p>

<p align=left>I went to Qeynos to look for some spells I'm still missing but all I found were ones I have. I noticed this book at one of the merchants so bought it but found it filled with nothing but blank pages. I was so upset that I had wasted my money. Then I began to think that I could fill it with my thought so it would no longer be just blank pages. So after a lot of seaching I found a place to buy this quill and some ink.</p>

<p align=left>Last eve I watched my golden one perform the ceremony for Eala and Sunmoon. Twas beautiful. As I sat there I found my mind drifting off wondering what my golden one could possibly see in me as I am so young, but am greatful that he does see something.</p>

<p align=left>Gads it is soo cold here in Everfrost. Too cold to write any more. </p>

<p align=left>*closes the book and puts everything away*</p>
