<p align=left><b>Beginnings</b><br><i>by Aanlain Treeskin</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Aanlain crunched through the snow of the everfrost peaks, trailing his quarry. The snow orc Mountaineer that had been raiding the hills near Qeynos was close. He scanned the ridgeline waiting for the orc’s silhouette to appear against the skyline. </p>

<p align=left>If anything he is patient, for days he had been trailing the orc as it made it’s way home, wounded, and loaded down with spoils from the raids.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain sat to prepare himself a quick meal, he hadn’t eaten in a day, and was quite hungry. As he unfolded a skin with some of his niece’s fish filets he heard a scraping noise very close to his position. He stood up to witness the largest white spider he had ever seen go scuttling by at full speed. Just then a banshee wail from behind him, made him turn.</p>

<p align=left>A blur was all he saw as he was knocked to the ground, nearly rolling into his small fire. Thinking he was under attack, Aanlain tried to disentangle himself from his assailant, so that he might reach his weapons. He finally freed himself and rolled to reach his weapons, then stood up.</p>

<p align=left>“Damn ye!, look what you’ve done! I’ll never catch it now” said Aanlain’s assailant. Aanlain reached down and picked up a club, and handed it to the other druid. “Here, ye dropped this.” He said. The druid stood, removed it’s cap and turned to look at Aanlain in a single fluid motion. </p>

<p align=left>Hair the color of black gold fell from beneath the cap, and eyes like jewels took the breath from Aanlain’s chest and stopped his heart. In that single moment everything that Aanlain had been doing and thinking about were forgotten. Gone was the excitement of tracking his quarry, replaced by the excitement of this chance encounter.</p>

<p align=left>“If ye think you could close yer mouth, and take a step back I’d like me shield as well” said the young maid. Not knowing he had been gaping, Aanlain snapped his mouth shut and stepped back to pick up the shield, cheeks aflame in embarrassment. “I am sorry miss, Stunned I was by yer beauty” he said quietly.</p>

<p align=left>“Never mind that, just hand me the shield and I’ll be off, I need the silk from yon spider, and if I have any hope of catching it again I canna be standin round gabbin with the likes of you” quipped the young woman. With that she grabbed the shield and resumed tracking her prey.</p>

<p align=left>“Humph!” mumbled Aanlain. “The nerve of that lass, after all she ran into me” Aanlain gathered up the few pieces of fish that had not been trampled on to resume his meal. As he finished the last bite he heard a scream from the next ridge. Quickly picking up his meager belongings, Aanlain ran to the source of the scream.</p>

<p align=left>As he topped the ridge he looked down and saw his target, the very Orc mountaineer he had been tracking locked in combat with the druid he had just met. Thinking to assist, he ran down, and started to cast a spell. 
“No! he is mine, I do not need yer help Elf!” cried the woman. Distracted as she was the orc slipped in a massive punch to her shield arm. A small gasp as numbed fingers dropped the shield was the only indication she gave that she had been hit.</p>

<p align=left>She screamed a battle cry and redoubled her efforts to bring the orc down. Aanlain lowered his weapons and watched the fight. “Yer timing is off woman” he said as spell after spell that the druid tried to cast was interrupted. “Bah! Leave me be and go about yer business” she scoffed ,and again the orc managed to make contact again, this time on her weapon arm. Again she made no notice of her wounds, and again resumed the fight.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain was amazed, all his life he had preconceived notions of what human women were capable of. A barmaid, sure, a scullery maid, indeed, a druid, never! But yet here she was, one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen, wrapped in combat with a dangerous foe, and thinking nothing of herself, only to finish the fight.</p>

<p align=left>With a scream and a final swing, the druid finished off the orc. “Yer a mess lass, can I help ye?” Aanlain asked. The woman had sat where she was, obviously shaken. Blood trickled down from a cut on her temple and mixed with the tears on her cheeks.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain decided to help, regardless of how she might take it. He cast a spell of healing, reached into his pack and handed the woman a clean cloth, that she might be able to wipe her face. “Well met, I am called Aanlain” he said. The young druidess took the proffered cloth and wiped the sweat and blood from her face.</p>

<p align=left>“Well met Aanlain, I am sorry to be so cross with ye… Runnnin into ya like that scared me a bit and then the orc jumpin me after me killed the spider was a bit much fer me. I am Azra, and agin thankee fer yer help.” she said quietly.</p>

<p align=left>“I can help ye a bit more lass, as I too am a follower of Tunare, there are things I can do to show you that will let not get hurt as badly when next you need to fight.” Aanlain said.</p>

<p align=left>The young druid looked up from the cloth, a smile spreading across her face. “Anythin that can help me stay alive would be a blessin, thankee” she said.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain and Azra, spent the next few days together, he teaching her the rudiments of druid craft, the ability to forage, and cast protective shields, she in turn teaching him ways to prepare the food that is foraged so that would taste better.</p>

<p align=left>On their third day together A messenger arrived in Halas from Freeport, and sought out the pair. “You be the druid Aanlain?” asked the bard. “Aye, have ye a message fer me?” replied Aanlain.</p>

<p align=left>The bard handed Aanlain a scroll and he opened it and began to read…</p>

<p align=left>Hail My druid friend,<br> 
It has come to my attention that the shard<br>
of black volcanic glass that I have been searching for<br>
has been seen on a certain Kobold in the area of Nagafen’s<br>
lair. I require yer assistance to acquire it. So far I have<br> 
recruited a barbarian Warrioress that you may know <br>
and a cleric that you have traveled with afore. Please make<br>
haste and meet me at the tavern at the western gate of Freeport<br>
And we shall sally forth from there.<br><br>

Your friend,<br> 
Woozle Walaryn</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain sighed as he finished the note. These past few days had passed altogether too quickly and he longed to stay. The pull of brothers and friends was one he could not deny, and he knew that he was honor bound to help.</p>

<p align=left>“Lass I must attend to matters in the south, but I would see you again if it’d please ye” he asked. The young druidess blushed and let out a short giggle of nervousness. “I have learned much from you in these last few days, and have enjoyed your company as well.” Her eyes fell and she let out a brief sigh. “I have matters I must attend to myself, so I know not where I will be when you finish.” sighed Azra.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain looked upon the face that he had dreamt of these last few nights and sighed… He was torn between the thing he cared about the most, his heart, and his friends. His eyes brightened and He quickly reached into his pack and drew forth a rolled up piece of cloth and handed it to Azra. “Here take these, and leave word for me with any druid you pass, they shall know of me and get word to me of your whereabouts” he said with a smile. “I must be off and assist my friends, but I shall return with haste when my obligations have been taken care of” he said.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain took Azra’s hand looked into her eyes and winked. He gently placed a kiss on her hand then waved. A few quick gestures and he faded away.</p>

<p align=left>Azra slumped back in her chair, looking at the package on the table top next to her. Curious she wondered what he could have left. She unrolled the package careful not to let anything fall. A flash of light gleamed off the polished metal of a beautifully crafted Steel Morning Star, and with it an ancient runed circlet that she could tell held magical properties.</p>

<p align=left>Grinning in anticipation of the damage such a weapon could produce, yet curious as to why a relative stranger would help her, she gathered her things and with a grim smile headed out the door, eyes on the horizon.</p>

<p align=left>And so it begins……….</p>
