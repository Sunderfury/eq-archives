<p align=left><b>Albert's Escape</b><br><i>by Albert</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I was so alone and afraid even though my Mom was here she was not acting right. She had came home late the other night and her crying woke me up. She was just sitting there in the tavern floor rocking back and forth crying and talking to people who were not there. I hid in my room all night until the morning when Sir Bentley came to the tavern. I was so happy to see him. He went over to my mom and attempted to make her well be he could not. He did wash her face and got her into her nightgown and Mister Kat came in also and helped. I started crying again and could not stop so Sir Bentley told me to contact my Auntie Atlantia with my communication crystal that she had given me. I rubbed the crystal and said crying, “Auntie Atlantia I need you…. my mom is not well and I am afraid”. The next thing I saw was a blue gate appeared and I stepped into it.</p>

<p align=left>When I walked through the gate, there was my Auntie Atlantia standing there smiling at me. I ran to her and hugged her. She held me in her arms a long time. I told her what had happened and how I was so afraid. I looked up at her face and there were tears in her eyes. She smiled at me and kissed me on my forehead and told me not to worry…. she would take care of me. She then asked if I had anything to eat today and I said no. She held my hand and took me to the kitchen where I got to meet Julia.</p>

<p align=left>Julia was real pretty and young. I told Julia that I know what sailor’s do did she want to see. Julia laughed and said,” my son I am a sailor and I have heard about your “sailor tricks”. Then she winked at me and said I could show her when I was much older. I told Julia how much I liked her cooking and she smile back at me. Julia said, “ thank you master Albert, I love cooking for little boy”. Auntie Atlantia went over to Julia and said something to her. I could not hear what she said but Julia looked upset for a moment and she said “Oh Dear…the poor boy.” Then I saw Julia smile and nod to Auntie Atlantia and then both of them came over to me. Auntie Atlantia kneeled down next to me and smiled and said that Julia was going to fix me some breakfast and that Solar Windstorm was coming over to meet me. Auntie Atlantia hugged me again real tight and told me not to worry I was going to be safe here. She said that she had to go and run some errands but she will be back soon and she kissed me again and stepped into a blue gate.</p>

<p align=left>Julia came over and brought me a huge plate full of pancakes. I ate until I could not eat anymore. Julia laughed and said she had never seen such a small boy eat so much food. Just as I finished eating this man walked into the kitchen he said his name was Solar Windstorm and I could call him Solar. He was an old man with gray hair and a long beard…I was afraid of him at first but he is a real nice man. He asked me to come with him. We went into this big room full of books…I have never seen so many books in my life. I showed Mister Solar how I could read and write my name. He smiled and said that was very good and he was going to teach me how to read so I could read all of these books. I smiled and sat next to him as we started my lesson.</p>
