<p align=left><b>The Curse</b><br><i>by Celesta</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Rain poured endlessly onto the grounds of the Akalabethian clearing. A girl staggered into the clearing holding the bleeding wound at her waist. Only being able to take a few more steps, she collapsed onto one of the benches and died. The storm continued to rain on the corpse carrying the blood into the soil of the clearing</p>

<br>

<p align=left>"'Tis a shame, really," an Akalabethian man named Bentley said, picking up the dead body. "Such a young girl."</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, who would have the heart to do this?" Atlantia, another Akalabethian, replied to her friend.</p>

<p align=left>The two began to take the body out of the clearing as Mulan trotted into the clearing on her white stallion.</p>

<p align=left>"Hail my friends!" Mulan said as she demounted her horse to get a closer look at what her friends were doing.</p>

<p align=left>"Hello, M'lady," Bentley replied.</p>

<p align=left>"Good morning Mulan!" Atlantia greeted back.</p>

<p align=left>"What happened here?" Mulan asked.
<p align=left>"The poor girl died here last night. She has a (horrifying) wound across her waist." He turned the body over and pointed at the gash.</p>

<p align=left>Mulan gasped, "Oh, my..."</p>

<p align=left>"Exactly what I thought, Mulan," Atlantia said helping Bentley pick up the corpse again.</p>

<p align=left>"Not just that, it's Jennifer, she was my best friend when I was growing up." Mulan sobbed.</p>

<p align=left>"I am so sorry, M'lady," Bentley comforted her. "But do not forget, you can visit her when you return to the underworld once again."</p>

<p align=left>"Aye! And I will!" Mulan responded as she mounted her horse. "Fare well my friends." She heard both of them bid her farewell just before she was out of the clearing.</p>

<br>

<p align=left>Mulan paced through her house slowly, looking at all of the items in her house. She had been moving everything around since morning, just for a little change. Suddenly, a cold chill swept over her, and she immediately turned around to see who was watching her.</p>

<p align=left>"You scared me!" Mulan said sighing with relief.</p>

<p align=left>"'Tis was I do best, my dear," a ghostly figure replied back with a chuckle as he took a seat.</p>

<p align=left>Mulan watched the faint figure find his way to a seat and then continued to change the positions of a few more items in her house. The ghost watched her intently before rising from his seat and moving behind her. He began to speak, but Mulan interrupted him.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, I am aware that ye can resurrect her. However, I also know she will be undead like yourself." Mulan stated clearly as if she had read his mind. She turned around and glared at the nearly invisible ghost. "Nay, I do not want ye to do that." Mulan turned back around to continue with her work.</p>

<p align=left>"If that is was ye truly want, my dear," he replied.</p>

<p align=left>"I can still visit her in the underworld."</p>

<p align=left>"Is that so? Tell me, have ye visited her yet?" The ghost questioned Mulan.</p>

<p align=left>"Nay, but why do ye ask?" She questioned back.</p>

<p align=left>"Oh, nothing, my dear." He chuckled softly as Mulan felt his presence leave the house.</p>

<br>

<p align=left>"Brrr..." Mulan shivered. "Is it just me or is it colder down here?"</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, 'tis been much colder down 'ere since Persephone came," Celesta answered as she continued to walk with Mulan to her Brother Hades' chamber. Mulan wanted to know where she could find her friend's dead spirit.</p>

<p align=left>As the two of them reached the door, they found it was already open. Mulan thanked Celesta and waved as she disappeared to the mortal realm. Mulan stepped inside and found Hades sitting in his chair already searching through the underworld with his mind looking for Jennifer's spirit.</p>

<p align=left>"You should tell me when you decide to read my mind so I do not have to walk all of the way down here!" Mulan complained.</p>

<p align=left>"And deny myself the pleasure of seeing you? I think not." Hades replied smiling. "I have been searching, Mulan, but I am sorry to say I have been unable to find this friend of yours."</p>

<p align=left>"But that can not be! I saw her dead body in the Akalabethian clearing!" Mulan stuttered.</p>

<p align=left>"Let me ask Celesta," Hades paused for a moment and closed his eyes. He was communicating to his sister through his mind. He opened his eyes and spoke very clearly to Mulan. "She has not heard of your friend, Mulan. And, of course, Celesta would be the one who knows who enters the underworld."</p>

<p align=left>Mulan nodded. "Aye, but I thought I should ask ye first to be sure. Thank you." Mulan left the chamber and closed the door behind her.</p>

<br>

<p align=left>Mulan was sitting at a small table in her house writing when she felt the cold chill again, except it was more concentrated and felt like a hand landing on her shoulder.</p>

<p align=left>"I know why she is not in the realm of the dead, my dear," the ghost spoke. "She has been cursed to roam in this mortal realm forever."</p>

<p align=left>Mulan stood up to face the ghost. "Oh? And how would ye know this?"</p>

<p align=left>"Because I cursed her," he replied.</p>

<p align=left>"What? How could he do that to her? To me? Especially when ye know she is my friend!"</p>

<p align=left>"Sit down and I will explain to ye, my dear," he took a seat next to Mulan's chair as she slowly sat down. "It was late one evening when I was roaming the town of Britain for not much of a reason at all. I came across a tavern and went inside. I saw that friend of yours and began to watch her. She was drunk as could be, so I decided to keep an eye on her for ye, so she would not get into any trouble. Eventually, she staggered out of the tavern and began to walk, or should I say stumble, to the farms. I followed her to a farm of a mortal friend of mine, and as ye know he has cows out in this field. I continued to watch her, and then she did the most horrible thing ever; she tipped all of the cows."</p>

<p align=left>"No!" Mulan said unbelievingly.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, my dear, she did. I was furious, so I cursed her for it. I do not know how she died, for I did not bother to keep an eye on her any longer."</p>

<p align=left>Mulan shook her head. "I can not believe she would do something like that, drunk or not. Why do ye not just remove the curse?"</p>

<p align=left>"Ye know I would, but it requires a sacrifice or a relative, or someone very closer to her. Like yourself, my dear. And, ye know I can resurrect people." Mulan felt another chill from the ghost as his hand brushed her face.</p>

<p align=left>"And be undead? I am sorry but that is too much for me, and people need me here." Mulan replied.</p>

<p align=left>"As ye wish, my dear. Come to the altar at the Ebon Skull tower when ye find a sacrifice," he told her as he faded from view.</p>

<br>

<p align=left>Mulan had been sitting under the tree in the Akalabethian clearing thinking about who would sacrifice themselves for Jennifer all morning. As far as Mulan knew, all of Jennifer's family was dead, that is why she had become an alcoholic. Just before she mounted her horse to leave, Mulan heard someone come out from behind a house and come towards her.</p>

<p align=left>"I know someone who would die for your friend Jennifer," the girl spoke, obvious to Mulan the girl had been listening to Mulan.</p>

<p align=left>"Oh? Who would that be?" Mulan asked.</p>

<p align=left>"Gwenn, Jennifer's sister," the girl replied.</p>

<p align=left>"Where might I find her?"</p>

<p align=left>"Right here," the girl pointed to herself. "I am Jennifer's sister, Gwenn. I will sacrifice myself for her. There is nothing for me here in this world, and I hope there is in the next."</p>



<p align=left>"That is awfully kind of ye. Please, follow me." Mulan concentrated her mage powers into a blue portal. They both passed through the gate and were transported to the Ebon Skulls tower where the ghost waited patiently. Without even being asked, Gwenn stepped upon the stone altar. The ghost began to cast a dark spell forming an orb of magic in his hands. Once the spell was finished he mentally threw the orb at Gwenn killing her instantly and tossing her body to the side. Two ghosts appeared and disappeared in a split second as they were being sent to the underworld. Mulan blinked, astonished at what she had just witnessed.</p>

<p align=left>The ghost chuckled, "Are ye still sure about staying mortal, my dear?"</p>

<p align=left>"Aye," Mulan said shaking the pictures of what just happened out of her head.</p>

She noticed him grin faintly, "I will return for ye." And he vanished once again.</p>
