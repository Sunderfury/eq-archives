<p align=left><b>Cookies For The Abbey</b><br><i>by Mary</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The smell of freshly baked cookies wrapped itself around Mary's small family cottage like a warm blanket on a cold winter's night. Mary loved the way the house smelled when she and her mother baked. In fact baking cookies was probably Mary's most favorite thing in the world, next to playing tea party, of course. She particularly loved the way the sticky-sweet dough tasted when licked from her fingers. Mary and her mother have been baking since before dawn and were just finishing up the last batch of chocolate chip (affectionately known to Mary as chippers) now. Mary is just a tad anxious to load her basket and be on her way. She is looking forward to playing with the children at the Abby.</p>

<p align=left>"Are you sure they ain't done yet, momma?" She asked nervously. </p>

<p align=left>"What did I tell you about saying ain't, Mary?" Her mother chided. </p>

<p align=left>Mary looked down at her feet and hung her head in shame. Shuffling her feet, not wanting to meet her Mother's disappointed gaze; she recited the words she had heard at least a hundred times before. "Ain't ain'…er…is… not a word." </p>

<p align=left>"That is right dear, and people use words, animals make sounds. We don't want anyone saying you are an animal now do we?"</p>

<p align=left>"No, momma," the girl sighed. Now that the grammar lesson was over maybe they could get back to the matter at hand. Mary was growing more impatient by the minute. </p>

<p align=left>"I think they're burning, momma!" The child exclaimed.</p>

<p align=left>"Mary, they are not burning but if you are so worried about them then take them out of the oven. I'm sure they are fine." Her mother replied.</p>

<p align=left>At last! Now finally she could be on her way. Mary used the oversized oven mitts to take the last tray of cookies from the big stone oven and sat them on the windowsill to cool. She then placed the other trays gently into a large picnic basket. Taking off her apron, she quickly smoothed out her dress and checked the bows on her topknot in the mirror. Satisfied with her appearance, she grabbed a light cloak from the rack, waved good-bye to her mother, and skipped merrily out the door. The last tray of chippers left forgotten and alone on the windowsill. </p>

<p align=left>Mary hardly noticed the walk to the Abby in her haste to get there. The anticipation at meeting all those children was almost more than the young girl could endure. Her mother had assured her that making, the orphans at the Abby, cookies was a sure fired way to make new friends and Mary was eager to prove her dear mother right. If there was one thing in all the world that Mary truly loved it was making friends. 
The girl ran the last few yards to the monastery and practically flew into the arms of the young monk who opened the door. </p>

<p align=left>The child was so winded from her hasty journey, her face was flushed and her words came out in a heated rush that was barely comprehensible to the good the priest. If he had not been previously aware of the nature of her visit, he could have very easily thought she was running for her life and seeking sanctuary in the confines of the church. </p>

<p align=left>"Hello, Brother Daniel. I brought the cookies for all the orphans…momma said that'd be nice, member? I made a whole bunch…I hope its enough…I made chippers, sugar cookies, butter cookies, and peanut butter too…I think its enough…its more than I can count…I can count a lot too…wanna see…one, two, three, four, six, twelve, ten, twenty…I can count more but not now…I want to meet the children…can I…huh…can I now…please can I? Oh yea, here…" Mary placed a box in his hand as she finished her seemingly endless greeting.</p>

<p align=left>The monk smiled warmly at the girl's overwhelming excitement. He could not help but laugh as she wiggled and squirmed, craning her neck first this way then that way, standing on tip toes trying her best to see around the tall, robust, young man. It was as though she expected the children to be hiding behind his robes. "Don't worry Mary. The children are expecting you. I am sure you will have enough cookies for all." </p>

<p align=left>Brother Daniel led her to the chapel and there as promised were hordes of children. Children of all ages, shapes and sizes, all sitting quietly in the pews waiting for the hostess to arrive and arrive she had. Mary sat the basket of cookies on a serving table placed in the back of the room and flung open the lid with glee. The trip to the Abby was so quick that most of the cookies were still warm and the aroma filled the room with the sweet scent of home. In her eagerness to make new friends Mary set about shoving cookies into the children's waiting hands like a child possessed. Within moments of her arrival every orphan in the Abby was happily munching on her lovingly made cookies.</p>

<p align=left>"Ok, what does everyone want to play now?" Mary blurted out before the first child had finished a cookie. The children looked up startled by the question as much as by the sound of her voice echoing in the silent room. </p>

<p align=left>Fearing that the girl may spoil the moment in her anxiousness to befriend the children, Brother Daniel stepped forward to keep things running smoothly. "Mary my child, you must give the children a chance to finish their treats. There is no need to rush, you will have plenty of time to play after they have eaten." </p>

<p align=left>Mary's face went pale as she realized the rudeness of her outburst. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make them eat in a hurry. Momma says only pigs gobble their food…I sorry." </p>

<p align=left>Taking a deep breath (the first Brother Daniel saw her take since her arrival), Mary calmed herself and sat down in a chair at the serving table to wait. </p>

<p align=left>All at once, a little girl of about five years stood up and walked closer to the table where Mary was sitting. Mary noticed the girl had only taken a single bite of her cookie but chose not to comment on it. Looking first at Mary and then at Brother Daniel the little girl spoke. </p>

<p align=left>"Why does Mary talk like a little girl and like to play games when she is really a grown up, Brother Daniel?" The little girl asked. </p>

<p align=left>Brother Daniel looked appalled but Mary did not even seem to register the little girl's question. Not wanting to discuss Mary's mental disability in front of her, he quickly tried to change the subject. "Now Lisa lets not discuss that right now. You haven't even finished your cookie." </p>

<p align=left>Wrinkling her nose in a most adolescent way. "But it tastes funny," Lisa replied.</p>

<p align=left>The other children murmured in agreement. Scanning the room, the monk noticed that none of the children were eating their cookies and in fact, a few were actually spitting them out into the planters in the corners of the room. Little Tommy Haley had his tongue stuck out with thoroughly chewed cookie on it showing his food to his friend Johnny. " 'Ook, Ohnnie my 'ongue is gween." </p>

<p align=left>Danny had an odd look on his face and suddenly opened his mouth in mid-chew to stick his fingers inside, pulling them out slowly he withdrew a long black filament. "Mine has a hair in it," he stated disgustedly. </p>

<p align=left>Brother Daniel grimaced. This was not turning out near as well as he had hoped, indeed it was quickly turning into a disaster. Susie Mitchell decided to take this opportunity to ask something that had been troubling her ever since Mary had arrived. "What's wrong with her eyes? How does she see like that?" </p>

<p align=left>Mary was starting to fidget in her sit. She was ready for the children to start being her friend now but she could see that they were no where near done with their refreshments. How could children eat cookies so slowly? Mary loved cookies but she refrained from eating any herself incase the other children wanted seconds. </p>

<p align=left>Brother Daniel tried again to wash over the inquiries about Mary's physical appearance. "Susie honey, it is not nice to talk about how other people look. Everyone is different in appearance but we are special in the Lord's eyes." </p>

<p align=left>Then totally without warning a chubby little boy named Timmy White started to gasp for air and claw frantically at his throat. The boy was seated in the back of the room and there were several pews between him and the acting chaperone. Brother Daniel stood watching frozen in fear as the boy's pudgy face turned various shades of green then blue. Still gagging and raking hysterically at his throat the boy tumbled from his seat landing hard on the floor. The shock of the impact breaking the monk's momentary paralyzes; Brother Daniel raced to his side, sat him upright and began to rain down blow after blow on the semi-conscious boy's back. After what seemed like an eternity, the boy's body lurched forward as he wretched from deep within…half digested cookie and the remains of the boy's breakfast spewed forth from his blue lips in a torrid flood of foul smelling vomit. Timmy gasped and took in a strangled breath of much needed air, looking at Brother Daniel with tear-rimmed eyes Timmy pathetically voiced the opinion of every child in the room…</p>

<p align=left>"These cookies are yucky," he sobbed. </p>

<p align=left>Brother Daniel gave a silent pray of thanks to the Lord that the boy was all right, then looked forlornly around the room. The other children were nodding their heads in obvious affirmation. Many of them had thrown their cookies on the floor and crumbled them up to feed to the church (who also refused to eat the gifts). The monk shook his head sadly and looked over to see what effect this incident was having on Mary. What he saw nearly broke his heart.</p>

<p align=left>Mary was still sitting her chair rocking back and forth with her eyes tightly closed, her hands over her ears, humming loudly to herself attempting to block out the voices of the other children. He watched with remorse as a giant tear pushed its way from beneath Mary's shielded lids and rolled down her cheek. The priest rose to go offer the girl comfort, when suddenly she stopped rocking and her eyes flew open wide. A strange look came over her lovely face and she seemed to stare right past him into space. </p>

<p align=left>"Mom…ma… Yes momma, I hear you. Yes momma, I will come right home," she sobbed. Without another word, Mary got up and walked out of the room and straight out of the Abbey. </p>

<p align=left>Mary did not remember the walk home. For that matter, she didn't remember anything after her mother calling her. Neither did she notice the scurry of dozens of rats fleeing from the tray of forgotten cookies left on the windowsill. Mary was tired. It had been a long day and it was surely time for little girls to be in bed. Everything would be better tomorrow after she slept. She just needed to sleep….</p>

<p align=left>***************************************************************************************</p>

<p align=left>The morning bells were ringing calling the citizens of Yew to Sunday mass. It was a beautiful day and Brother Daniel knew that father Michael had a wonderful service prepared for this morning. Daniel had just put the last knot in his pray beads as father Michael entered the vestibule with the communion tray. Seeing the tray of holy wafers instantly brought the memory of Mary's visit last week, to his mind. Brother Daniel stopped smiling and a cloud of sorrow crossed his face. Father Michael noted the change immediately and asked what was wrong. </p>

<p align=left>"I was just thinking about what a horrible disappointment poor Mary's visit turned out to be for her. The child has such a good heart I hate to see her hurt that way." Brother Daniel explained.</p>

<p align=left>Father Michael nodded. "Yes, it was tragic my son but I am sure that the Lord is watching over Mary even as he watches over us all. I think he takes extra care with a soul as special as Mary's." </p>

<p align=left>Father Michael paused a moment and his eyes lit up as if he had just realized something. "That reminds me Brother Daniel, did you happen to thank the girl for the beautiful new tithe box she crafted for us?"</p>

<p align=left>Brother Daniel snapped his fingers in frustration. Darn it, what with all the excitement during her visit the priest had completely neglected to comment on the extraordinary gift. Now the man felt even worse about how Mary was treated during her last visitation. He would have to pay Mary a visit after the service today to make up for his awful behavior. He would even eat her cookies if need be…though he hoped it would not come to that. </p>

<p align=left>The congregation had assembled and Brother Elias was even now collecting the very same tithe box that father Michael and Brother Daniel were talking about. The service was about to begin. As soon as Brother Elias tallied the total of today's collection father Michael would begin the sermon. As father Michael and Brother Daniel prepared to enter the chapel, Brother Elias lifted the lid of the donation box…</p>

<p align=left>**************************************************************************************</p>

<p align=left>The explosion was deafening. The entire Abby shook from the force of the blast. The priests awaiting entry in the adjoining vestibules were knocked off their feet by the concussion. Brother Elias and the wall where he stood were completely gone. There was nothing left of either of them. The entire west- side of the chapel was totally destroyed. Shrapnel and fallen debris injured several of the parishioners, women screamed in pain and children wailed for lost parents. The chapel was a mass of utter confusion. </p>

<p align=left>Why would the Lord allow such a thing to happen…here in his house…on this the holiest of days? Was this a punishment…an enactment of his wrath for some wrong doing his children had committed? The clergy prayed for forgiveness. The scholars looked for answers. The soldiers asked for guidance. The people asked why. The children simply cried.</p>
