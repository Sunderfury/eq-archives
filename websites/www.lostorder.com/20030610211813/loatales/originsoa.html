<p align=left><b>Origin Of The Shadows Of Akalabeth</b><br><i>by Yarp the Never</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Where there is light, there must be Shadow. For many years, the light from
the Shard all but blotted out the Shadow, but in recent times the Light has
dimmed. Uncontested power breeds comfort and comfort breeds complacency.
Over time, the Shadows have grown stronger and of late, begun to manifest.
They seek not to destroy the light, as others have before them, but instead
they seek to harness the Light. If they can control where the Light shines,
they can control where the Shadows manifest.</p>

<p align=left>*Found suddenly, having mysteriously appeared in the back of the
Oracular Tome, scrawled in an unknown hand.*</p>

<p align=left>When the White Light was split by the High Council of the Lost
Order of Akalabeth, and the Shard of Light was removed, the High Council was
hurried in their efforts to leave Sosaria. Unbeknownst to the High Council,
the Shard of Light that they brought with them was fractured. A hairline
crack it was, miniscule to be sure, but the Shard was flawed nonetheless.
For eons, the Light from the Shard shone without fail, the light inside pulsing
mysteriously with life of it's own, sustaining and preserving the life of
the Lost Order of Akalabeth. For eons, the Light brewed a shadow, as tiny
as the fracture itself. Then one day - escape.</p>

<p align=left>The ebbs in the pulse of the Shard had begun to grow more
common. Unnoticeable to the naked eye, perceived as intangible
rumblings by the Guardians, brought on by complacency by those in the Order
who had grown fat on their success, the Shadow escaped during a deep ebb,
fleeing into the night. The Guardians rose all at once, manifesting
silently in the clearing in a heartbeat, prepared to fight a danger they did
not yet understand. They maintained their vigil all night and all the next
day, before retiring finally to rest. All seemed to return to normal in the
Village of Akalabeth.</p>

<p align=left>The Shadow fled into the forests of Yew, silencing the wildlife
wherever it went. Never seen, yet always sensed, the hunters, lumberjacks
and healers wandering the forest all felt the same dank presence. Until the
Shadow found Akalabethian dissent, in the forms of Yarp and Tara. Infecting
them, permeating them....turning them.</p>

<p align=left>Yarp the Ever fell easily. He made the choice of his own free
will, grasping desperately at the Shadow without knowing fully what it was.
Without effort the Shadow entered his darkest thoughts, bringing them to the
surface, suffocating his once-noble psyche. In the Crypts of Yew, surrounded by
the Wraiths of the Order of the Ebon Skull, Yarp the Never was born. As he
stood for the first time, reborn a powerful presence, the Shadow stood
beside him, stronger than before.</p>

<p align=left>As Tara knelt, fully accepting for the first time her destiny as
a Vampire, with her sire standing before her like a proud father, the Shadow
lurked nearby like an equally proud mother.</p>

<p align=left>There would be others that would feed the Shadow and over time
it would grow as it continued to prey on the weaknesses of the Order. They
would not become aware of what was happening until it was too late and the
Shadow controlled the Shard. There would be conflict to be sure, but as the
Shadow was born of the Light, so it understood it's nature. More
importantly, the Shadow knew that to destroy the Light which gave it life
would mean it's own demise, for the Shadow could not exist without the
Light. Verily, where there was Light there must always be Shadow. No,
instead, there would be a battle for control - two sides of the same soul, not
battling to destroy one another, but vying for control. As the Light
manifests itself in the Guardians, the Shadows do manifest. Can a soul
fight itself? Is there truly a loser and a winner? Mayhaps the nature of
the soul precludes a victor. Perhaps all the Lost Order can truly hope for
is to contain the Shadow, to drive it from it's hosts and back into the
wilderness. Time will tell, and this contest will not be a short one.</p>

<p align=left>Be warned, LightBringers. When you fight the Shadows, you fight yourselves.</p>

<p align=left>Be warned, Shadows. The power of the Light is piercing, and even the weakest
Light dissapates the Shadows effortlessly.</p>

<p align=left>So it is written, so shall it be.</p>
