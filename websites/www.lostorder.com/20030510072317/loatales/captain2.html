<p align=left>Cragstone, I finally made it to Cragstone! I tell ye, I thought I would never live to see anything outside of Glenden Wood. Not to say I didn't enjoy me time there, as they have what I consider the only real ale I've had in me time here, but I'm longin' fer the smell of the salty sea air and the cool brisk sea breezes. Mayhaps soon I shall see the great seas again, but fer now, the river and lake here in Cragstone will have to do.</p>

<p align=left>I learned a valuable lesson on the way here though. First, tis a good thing I've kept meself rather fit, as I've never run so much in me life! I tell ye that I feel about as yellow as a cowardly merchant beggin' fer his life and cargo. The other lesson I've learned is that the beasties here are smarter than the average beastie. 'Specially those bloody wasps! Darned things fling magik as if it was the venom from their stingers or something. One very nearly froze me arse in place durrin' me late night run here.</p>

<p align=left>I've heard some rumors here at the local tavern, about the number and variety of beasties that pray travelers on the open plains. I'm ready to agree with them on that regard. I should learn to be more careful, (or run faster) in the future. I'm still holdin' out hope that the stories of "the Brotherhood of the Shard and Tome" in Rithwic are true. More so I hope that me suspicions are right and tis really me brothers and sisters in the Lost Order that are gatherin' there. Now I truly feel like one of the "Lost" though. Perhaps this is similar to how the Architects felt when they left Sosaria the first time. Perhaps I'll learn more tomorrow when I try to make the trip to Rithwic. First however, I need an ale, a nice stout LARGE ale...</p>

<p align=left>Cragstone is a rather nice town. I've had the chance to spend some time
restin' here and getting to know the lay of the land. Tis nice to be so
near the water again. According to what I heard tell from the dunkards in
the local tavern, there used to be some rather important folk livin' on the
isle in the middle of the lake. I should like to know more, seein' as the
more I learn of this land and its rather colored history the more i want to
know. I've also spend a couple days huntin' rabbits and drudges (that's
what the locals call those cat lookin' like things) in the area to the south
west of town. Perhaps in a couple of days time I'll head off fer Rithwic
again.</p>

<p align=left>I tell ye, if I should have never worried about the trip from Cragstone to
Rithwic bein' any less interesting that the one from Glenden Wood. I left
Cragstone right about dusk and headed on the road south of town. The
buggers at the local tavern said that was the way to go so go I went. I
think they were tryin' to kill me.</p>

<p align=left>Not a 'alf mile out of town I happened upon a camp of drudges. The blokes
nearaly turned me into cat food if it weren't fer another taveler passin'
by. Me hands still won't quite do what I tell 'em when it comes to workin'
me bow. And this sorry excuse fer a 'prentice bow I'm haulin' just isn't
worth its weight in mud. Still we dispatched that little camp and when
about our ways.</p>

<p align=left>I should have keep up me runnin' fer Rithwic, much as I did before, but I
happened across an ole abandoned far house. Seems there was a fine young
lass 'ere sellin' arrow's and the like. She's offered me a place fer the
night and who am I to turn down such and offer from a young beauty as
herself. Come to think of it, it may be a wee bit longer afore I see the
fair city of Rithwic.</p>
