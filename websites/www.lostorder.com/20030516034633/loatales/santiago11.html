<p align=left><b>Impure Thoughts</b><br><i>by Santiago</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><i>There were no words anymore. They had been discarded, like the clothing that lay in forgotten piles upon the bedroom floor. He spoke to her now with ardent kisses, and she responded with sighs, gasps and moans. The language of passion – simple, concise and unadorned, yet the two of them understood it perfectly.</i></p>

<p align=left><i>His hands began to wander all over her body, hungrily exploring every soft curve, every smooth valley, every delightful inch of her. His fingers knew exactly what to do, exactly where to go, and she shuddered and writhed as they brought her closer and closer to the edge of ecstasy…</i></p>

<p align=left>Santiago heard footsteps outside the door and quickly closed the book. The door opened, and Brother Jacob walked into the library.</p>

<p align=left>“Santiago? What are you doing here?”</p>

<p align=left>“A-Ahoy, matey!” Santiago stammered. “I was just readin’ a book ‘bout Holiness. Figgered I mought pick up a few pointers, seein’ as how I’m new to this monk business.”</p>

<p align=left>“You look flustered. Are you all right?”</p>

<p align=left>“Aye, I just got all caught up with the holiness an’ all. I was readin’, an’ I found meself gettin’ all excited with the thought o’ Virtue. These books bring ye closer to Virtue, they do!”</p>

<p align=left>“Well, I must admit that I’m surprised, Santiago. I never thought that such things would interest you.”</p>

<p align=left>“Oh, they do, matey. I’m larnin’ a lot!”</p>

<p align=left>“Perhaps I could point out some other good texts. What book were you reading just now?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago waved his hand dismissively. “Ah, ye prob’ly ain’t read this one…it’s kind o’ dull, actually. Ain’t worth even lookin’ at.”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, some of these are rather dry, but much can still be learned from them. Come, what’s the title?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago scrunched up his face. “The name was in me head just a bit ago, but it’s gone now. Ah, well. What say we go to the Chapel an’ meditate, eh?”</p>

<p align=left>“Very well,” said Jacob. “After you.”</p>

<p align=left>As Santiago moved toward the door, Jacob quickly circled around the table, picked up the book and peered at the title. “Natalie’s Anatomy.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago nodded quickly. “Aye. That one’s not so much ‘bout Virtue – more like science.”</p>

<p align=left>“I see,” said Jacob. He opened the book and flipped to a random page. “Her feeble protests soon turned into lusty encouragements as his tongue traced lazy, wet circles on her…” The priest swallowed and his face turned red. He looked up and frowned at Santiago.</p>

<p align=left>The former pirate shrugged helplessly. “That book ain’t mine, matey! I dunno how it got there! I was just readin’, like I said, an’ then I come across this dirty ol’ book! Soon as I realized what it was, I was gonna throw it away, but that’s right when ye walked in on me!”</p>

<p align=left>“Is that the truth, Santiago?”</p>

<p align=left>The guilty acolyte looked down and shuffled his feet a bit. “Well, not entirely, not exactly, not altogether…”</p>

<p align=left>Jacob sighed. “I know that this is not easy for you, Santiago, but you must learn to put away these lustful thoughts. You have to learn to control the animal in you, if you wish to follow the path of Virtue.”</p>

<p align=left>“But how, matey?”</p>

<p align=left>“Well, when you see a woman, what’s the first thing that enters your mind?”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago grinned wolfishly.</p>

<p align=left>“That’s what I thought,” muttered Jacob. “But there’s your problem. Instead, whenever you look at a lady, try to think about something else. Think of…think of Virtue, or fishing, or reading, or something like that.”</p>

<p align=left>“Somethin’ bloody boring, in other words.”</p>

<p align=left>“Yes, to put it bluntly. Anything to take your mind off of…well, you know.”</p>

<p align=left>Santiago sighed. “Well, I’ll give it a try. Can’t be that hard I guess.”</p>

<p align=left>Jacob smiled and patted the young acolyte on the back. “That’s the spirit. We’ll make a virtuous man out of you yet.”</p>
