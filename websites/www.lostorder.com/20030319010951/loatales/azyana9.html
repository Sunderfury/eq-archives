<blockquote>
<p align=left>This eve my golden one came to me when I was with out my possessions on me. Yes, that does much better than saying I died because I was running after a mummy when an Ice Bone decided to join in on the fun. I was just trying too hard today to reach my next circle. </p>

<p align=left>Knowing how close I was he decided to resurrect me. That was sweet of him. I had gotten so close to my next circle so many times. I had just finished getting my possessions back when Dearg and Walterus came upon us. Dearg called us two love turtles and I quickly corrected him telling him that my golden one is my instructor. He quickly chimed in and told Dearg it was truly a teaching relationship. They chatted a bit and then they were off. </p>

<p align=left>I asked my golden one what they meant by saying that. He got quiet for a moment then he said that he feared others could see his growing affection for me. I was speechless. He told me that if I felt uncomfortable after hearing this he would leave. I quickly told him not to. I was about to admit that I was feeling the same way about him but then I thought better of it. He, always knowing what to say suggested I continue on with my hunting. </p>

<p align=left>My mind could not focus on the task at hand more on what he said. I had so much trouble hunting this eve. I went out over and over again to get something. With one of them, a mummy, I had such a hard time. My timing was all off and no matter what I did I either didn't hit it for much, fizzled, got interrupted… I got so upset all I could do is cry.
He told me to come back to where he was and meditate. I was still crying. He slipped his arm around me to comfort me and told me this was an important lesson. Sometimes when ya con something it is not always a true indication if it is within ya abilities. The mummies were a good example of that. They hit much harder than another would. He continued on with his soothing and reassuring words and then told me my tatics were correct but sometimes it is just the way it is with some creatures. He then sent me off to kill some more.</p>

<p align=left>Away I went and after awhile I got encumbered and had to sell. I passed too close to a mummy, which went after me. I got rid of it and went off again when a mummy attacked me. Luckily it was within my abilities and I was able to kill it and to top it all off I attained my next circle. I then happily went off to the vendor to sell my items and ran back to my golden one to rest. </p>

<p align=left>While resting I asked him a few questions. When I died I prepared to go after my body by casting Center and Holy armor. After he resurrected me these were gone. He then told me that any resurrection would remove any spell that has been cast on ya, reduce ya health to half and take away all your mana in addition to reducing your strength and agility for a while. My other question was why my spells were hitting so poorly on some undead. Usually it would hit for 90 but the last one I went up against it would only hit for 8 on some casts. He told me that some creatures are resistant that it is more likely to happen on creatures that are high blue and above. He also said if that a creature is completely resistant it was totally beyond my capabilities and should not be hunted.</p>

<p align=left>The hour grew late and my golden one looked tired. Before we said our good byes he told me my last objective would be to get well on my way to my next circle of knowledge… one or two fifths along he way at least. After that we will return to our homeland and then go to Unrest.</p>

<p align=left>I can't help but smile right now thinking about what he said of his growing affection for me. I dare not admit to him that I feel the same. Maybe some day, but not just yet.</p>
