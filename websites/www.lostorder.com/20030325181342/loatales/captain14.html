<p align=left>Captain's Log: Solclaim 30</p>

<p align=left>It’s been almost a full fortnight since I last braved the wilds of Dereth, and I was still feelin’ the effects of me last encounter with a mud golem when I left Hebian-To. I’d been trying to rest and recover from such an adventure when my unfailing wander lust too over. I do enjoy good sake, but there is nothing to compare with a fine stout from an Aluvian pub.</p>

<p align=left>With that in mind I gathered me gear and struck out for Shoushi. I was determined to find my way back to Aluvian territory one way or another. Shoushi, I knew had a portal to Yanshi, which would put me within a day’s walk of Lytelthorpe.</p>

<p align=left>Portal travel is starting to get easier to handle for me, but it still will never be like walkin’ or sailin’ for me. This time when I arrived in Yanshi, I was able to hold onto the contents of my stomach, but I still needed a bit of time before I could do much of anything. I rested leanin’ again that giant boulder in the middle of the town.</p>

<p align=left>I guess the townsfolk think that boulder to be something important, since they were givin’ me the dirtiest looks I’ve seen this side of a banderling ball. This was unbelievably helpful in clearin’ my head so I could set off through the wild lands between Yanshi and Lytelthorpe. Something about angry locals always stirs that wanderlust in me legs and gives me the motivation to move on.</p>

<p align=left>With that I decided to move on before I caused a real stir in Yanshi. I set off to the north, hoping to find a road or maybe just stumble onto Lytelthorpe itself. It’s always humbling to think of how hard it is fer me to navigate this world. On the seas I was unmatched in me navigation skills (when sober) but here the land is so alien to me yet, that I have a hard time findin’ me way around sometimes.</p>

<p align=left>Still I set off in the direction I hoped would lead me to familiar Aluvian ale. Not too far north of town, I stumbled across one of those Sho tower in the wilds. The place was under attack by a small clan of drudges. Being who I am, I immediately set about perforating that pack of putrid cats and liberated the hour.</p>

<p align=left>One I finished off the last of those pesky kittens I checked the tower out. Seems the drudges had already killed the occupant of the house, which saddened me greatly. I said a few prayers fer the soul of the poor bugger that passed on, and decided to move on.</p>

<p align=left>The rest of my trip to Lytelthorpe was uneventful, which I don’t mind all that much. Seems though that I didn’t remember that certain “friends” in Lytelthorpe might not be so happy to see me. I wound up camping for the night at the eastern outpost. I need to stop makin’ a name fer myself one of these days.</p>
