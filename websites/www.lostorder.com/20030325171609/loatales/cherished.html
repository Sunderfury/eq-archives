<p align=left><b>To A Cherished Friend</b><br><i>by unknown</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I had wondered through<br>
This world all alone<br>
Never feeling your touch<br>
Never hearing you song.</p>

<p align=left>But then we met<br> 
In that hot desert sun<br>
And I knew in my heart<br>
That you were the one.</p>

<p align=left>My life was empty<br> 
And dry like that land<br>
But that has all ended<br>
For you are my true friend.</p>

<p align=left>The joys we share<br>
The light you bring<br>
Tis enough to make<br>
This poor ranger sing.</p>

<p align=left>So I put down these words<br>
That to yours can't compare<br>
But I want you to know<br>
I will always be there!</p>
