<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">Fire dungeon level 2 holds quite a few rooms.  Some of these rooms are death traps, such as the one with 3 liches and a lich lord.

: Fire dungeon level 2 holds quite a few rooms.  Some of these rooms are death traps, such as the one with 3 liches and a lich lord.  Some of these rooms just hold easy gold for anybody, such as the one holding two fire elementals.  Though the hell hound spawn in the hall there can make that room rather difficult.  The room just west of the stairs spawns a single efreet.  A warrior with good parry or a single mage can have a bit of fun there.  The next room south and east of that room spawns a pair of demons.  The best thing about the demon pair is that they don't have an additional spawn zone out in the hall, so you only need to fight two demons at a time.
