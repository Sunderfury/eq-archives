<p align=left><b>A Day Wit Bagz</b><br><i>byAzlana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>*wakes up in the Commons*</p>

<p align=left>Boy what day dat was. Bagz say come Guk so m'say okies an runs dere. Den he ask me if knowd way down. Told im kinda does but not dat good cuz few places m'always mess upon. He meets me an brings me down. Got place whre dere dis lil bridge an wen go cross it an los m'footin an SPLASH fell in. Bagz day go look for ladda. No find ladda but find Bagz down dere looking fer me. He leads me ladda an m'go up an den he falls in den m'falls back in. Neva knowd dere be ladda dere. Neva knowd dere be dem gators neither. He pointed out dis thin an dat thin along da way an fer life me not memba but ya gotta takes lef turn when get dere to get next zone.</p>

<p align=left>He go cast dat inviz ta undead on me an den we be off. Wen in water an swim up ta dat bedroom. He say dat good fer peoples pull stuff fer bein in 30 likes me. Den we go lef way an go round corner where dese skelies be an den ta dis bridge. Usually walk ova bridge but he jes say short cut face me an tooks step backwards. M'jes shrug an jump off too. Not too bad only 44 points damage. </p>

<p align=left>Wen got dere m'say greetins all an den dey start up wit all da buffins. Gimmel dere an ask me where m'axe? So puts way m'crystie blade an pokie an tooks out m'BIG axe. Den he say 'Thats Az talks softly but carries a big one'. * giggles* Dat true! Bagz say wot be group. Dere be 7 us so Dearg say Bagz be firs reject since he can takes care self. M'would been happy jes hangin bout watchin but guess dey think betta keep me in line an in group. *cackles* Walt does wot he does an start getting dis an dat an den gets dis bloodthirsty ghoul. Dang that thin almost had Walt down ta nutin three four times. One point Dearg say 'make dis slow kill' Wonder why he say dat. M'jes whack away hittin sometimes not hittin odders, tryin ta taunt but course no can do but what heck leas m'skill goes up. That dern thin hit m'fer likes 101.. 112… 80..80.. Jes thought self dang wot a meanie! Well dat one be dead an m'jes hanging round so m'whisper Bagz ' how come m'has such hard time taunting it?' He say it be deir level so dun even try. Guess it be like healer type people. Deir spells no work gainst some high up critters so dey go focus on healing us tanks. </p>

<p align=left>Whiles sittin waiting Bagz say froggies go Wan, Zol, Dan, den Guk in level dey is. M'ask if dat mean dey has tougher skins when likes a Dan or Guk one an says yes. No wonder m'axe no hit dem well. Dey gots toughs skin. Afore next right Nalle tells me no go an taunt. Well wot Nalle be knowin. So next battle m'snuck few an mos not successful den BAM it goes an stuns me an m'loses m'balance an go spinnin round. So maybe tauntin not such good idea. M'stuck wit da whackin da back.</p>

<p align=left>Bagz look at all m'armor an stuffs an say dat wot m'has perty good only thin new he say is get nudder gauntlet so can wear if m'main tank fer extra AC, upgrade m'shoulder ting though neva say ta wot, an gets sapphire electrum earrings replace gold one. It got like +4 stren an some int so can learn thins fasta. M'need more stren an maybe m'learn writings fasta if gets. </p>

<p align=left>M'was looking in dat frenzy room an dere be dis froggie up top. M'ask wot dat froggie be an dey say statue. M'ask if sure it be statue cuz it keep starin at me. Gimmel say starin at me cuz m'cute *smiles *. </p>

<p align=left>Well when Haka come was time split group so m'went wit Bagz an Haka. Figya dis way can ask im questions an stuff easier. Bagz show me dis room behind false wall. Firs m'thought m'goin nutz cuz no see im. He say dere be four things spawnin dere. He cleared it out den tells m'go keep checkin dat room. So m'goes down an practice getting back. M'not wan get los wit one dem things on m'arse. He jes mind me ta say INC or POP when gots one. </p>

<p align=left>M'was still confused bout da taunting stuff so Bagz say ta me 'Ok here is a rule for you. If you are in a group, and you have a driud that has thorned 1 tank do not taunt. That way monster takes most damage from thorns. If you are past half health and your party is in good shape do not taunt, otherwise taunt as much as you can. If you got a good group fighting limited monsters at a time one tank should only be taunting'. Den m'ask how bouts when has two tanks an one be low health? Bagz den say aye den ya can goes an taunt cuz it spreads out damage. Between fights m'did some thinking bout dis taunting stuffs. From watchin dem m'kinda figured out sumptin. Dey always be doing complete healin on Walt. Now ifn dey has go heal me an den complete heal Walt an den go heal me den dey might not has nuf mana ta go do dat complete heal on Walt. So it kinda makes sense not to do no taunting unless Walt be low health an dem healin people be low mana. </p>

<p align=left>We fights dis an dat an m'did few pulls. An den at one point Haka say NO PULL. Bagz den tells me dem healin folk likes a tank's boss. If dey no got no mana heal ya listen dem an no go runnin off an gets sumptin. </p>

<p align=left>Sittin dere m'notice how much dey all talk to each odder lots. Not likes way me talks but kinda short hand. Tanks be yellin INC an sometimes INC an Dan den afore goin off gain seein how much mana healin type folk got. Clerics say complete heal comin up den CHW or CHB. Sometimes on guildsay odder group say we be needin help so we go kill wotever we gots an go help dem. Odder thins m'noticin be likes dis when no has Druid ta do snaring, Haka would pop up an run ahead of where dem froggies run ta gets way an stops den casts root or stuns im. Haka keep track of all dem froggies an when dey gonna pop up an say 2 minutes ta pop or wotever it be. </p>

<p align=left>At one point dis caster comes an Walt say needs help so wes finished up froggie dat we gots an goes ova dere. Now m'usually knowd dat m'can disrupt critters it bashin so now got m'blueberry mask m'not can go an slam dem cuz no has shield. M'ask Bagz bouts dis. He say when gots casta ya gotta go an gets rid of it fast, cuz dey can destroy a group if dey be left alone an will kill our healers rights away. Well m'not wants dat ta happens. He say since m'not has bility to do da bashin when up gainst dem jes taunt an taunt an taunt cuz us warriors gots high magic resistance naturally. When m'not gots m'mask on an can do da slammin m'usually waits till m'sees dat critter beginin ta cast afore slammin so m'thinks has higher chance of disruptin dem. Dern, fergot ask bout dat. Maybe some odder time.</p>

<p align=left>We's kinda rested up when dis Bloodthirsty an Dar be popin up. Walt wen afta Bloodthristy an dis Dar pop up. Dearg lil upset an say 'Walt fetched without even asking me my mana level sigh*'. Guess Bagz need train Walt cuz Bagz say not too long go dat da clerics be ya boss. *shrugs * Dearg an Haka no has lot mana so Bagz say root da Dar an we move back. So Dearg go an root da Dar an we move. Boy was scary m'kept watchin Walt go beserkin an Bagz say 'heal Walt' since he had some hand thing he could do ta heal himself. M'watchin all dis an jus think self dat m'gonna die cuz if Walts goes an Bagz goes wot chance in all heck m'has. But we all lives. Afta all dat Walts jes said 'interseting fight'. M'thinks Bagz still high from surviving an den dat time Haka say 'Aye, not good both of us OOM )' an Dearg say 'Kldv close fight'. M'jes sat dere wonderin how m'still livin. </p>

<p align=left>Dat ova Bagz wen out an go fetchin den he say he f akin death be right wit us. Den he say dat da fakin death make him ultimate puller. So m'ask im whem m'get dat spell. He say dat warrior neva get dat, but den m'mind him an say 'well yas say ultimate puller.. m'gonna be dat'. Well den Bagz jes say 'Ya dats right. I fogot' </p>

<p align=left>We restin afta battle an Haka say NO PULLS. Haka be vera vera serious all time so m'sat behind im an kept pullin on his hair. Silly dwarf no be pain any attention ta me. Bagz run outta food an ask m'if had some. Course m'had some. M'listen ta Bags an stocked up on all m'stuffs afore, so m'gaves Bagz food. M'not wan say nutin specially since m'teacher but why heck he no has food when he wen go tells me has food an water all time. </p>

<p align=left>All rested up we hunts more when Walt say da Frenzy Froggie up. Wes all whack it an cours m'kept getting stunned, but m'swears m'neva taunted it. At da end of battle Haka take peek at da froggie an it had da sash on it. Well m'all tired an say m'jes gotta close m'eye fer lil bit. When m'wakes up Bagz an Walt tells me dat dey say m'get sash if m'gives Bagz my thick banded belt. Dat belt tooks lot work an lotta deaths ta get. Got it same day got m'mask an vera lucky roll of 99. So, Bagz an Walt splain You loose 9ac but gain 18 % speed an da only betta speed thin is a cloak of flame from da planes place. An den Bagz say dat warrior true callin be duel weild an double tackin so ova all dis trade gonna make m'betta warrior. He also say dat wit few new earrings can get m'stren back up ta 150 from 147 wit out belt. Den dey say dat it such good thing has an so hard ta get dat peoples be trading two yukky swords fer it. M'though heck be happy for one. M'still was not sure but when both Walt an Bagz say it be good thing den guess it good thing an m'traded wit Bagz. M'ask dem if work wit m'axe an dey said yes but da proc thing no work no more because be likes m'has on all da time. Den dey say dat all m'needin be betta 1hs weapons. </p>

<p align=left>Lil time passed seem when da Frenzy Froggie come up again!. An we kills it gain! An it had sash on it! M'think Walt was gonna fall ova when he seed dat. Walt jes say it be lore so told Bagz takes an try do trade for it. Well wit dat Walt say 'Ailill still need nudder yukka sword.' M'think self dat heck m'not need two cuz so young still an neva spect get nutin likes dis eva at my age so one be jes fine. Witin likes 5 minutes seems Bagz had da trade an only had meet up wit person get da Yukka sword. Bagz say '1 for Az, other for Ali' Wit all dat was time call end of day an we's all left. Haka wen go Freeport, Walt wen sleep, Bagz say go follow im druid circle cuz we gots ride waiting on us.</p>

<p align=left>His friend be round an tooks us all Cazic an we wen dis big pymarid ting. Bagz say goes up so m'goes up an ventually m'found dem. Lotsa good stuffs dere fight but too many dem liked me an m'died. So wit no cleric round m'runs ta Wes Common ring an Bagz friend come gets me whiles he gots m'body ta zone. M'gets all stuff an den Bagz say maybe dat not such good idea. Bagz' friend bring us ta Lava circle where he be sayin good bye us. Bagz go has see friend so we say good byes an den m'start yackin wit Aanlain.</p>

<p align=left>Aanlain meet me an m'gives im back his slashy weapon. We sat at gypsy camp talkings lots bout stuff, when Bagz say come Sol B. M'ask if Aanlain could come an he be sayin sure so m'say Aanlain 'Common les go die!'. He ask where an m'told him an he say okies lets go.</p>

<p align=left>By time got dere sooo many peoples outside m'jes thought 'oh greats, m'was jes kiddin bout dat dyin part but it sure gonna come dis eve.' Gonandar was outside waiting an stuffs. When Bagz gave all clear we go in an go Noble room. Den Slaydin an his friend come join us. Bagz keep pullin an pullin.. kobolds.. spidies.. bats.. one beetle *shudders *. Dat beetle hits fer ova 100 at a time. Afta it seem calm Bagz go tell m'go exploring. M'ask him 'Ya nutz?!' He say 'Ya'. So m'go off exploring goin dis way an dat way an running back ta where dey were. He say part bein good warrior be knowin ya way round an odder part be knowin where critters pop up an only way gonna know way round be exploring. M'perty proud self cuz wen round, an as usual in circles cuz ended up back where dey were. Was funny though peoples musta thought m'nutz cus evra time took wrong turn inta room dat be camped m'jes waved. </p>

<p align=left>One time dere be three bats dat come an m'whacked one an Bagz say zone it. Well m'knowd where zone was from running round so much so off m'wen to zone. Jes bout ta yell train when m'turn round an dey not following me. M'tell Bagz dat an he say come back. So us an odder folk start whackin way an dey all die. Bagz later tells me dat m'did right thing zonin dem cuz odder wise wit da peoples we had mos likely die. </p>

<p align=left>Laters on someone pull beetle. We gots it, but den laters Bagz say dat bad pull cuz da casters not be ready. We did more hunting an den m'was tired an so be Bagz so we say dat be it fer night an Gonandar say he go try get in group dere afta we leaves.</p>

<p align=left>Wot a long day. Wot exciting day! M'got see three dungeons an only die once. M'get sash wit Yakka on way an m'learn so much stuffs.</p>
