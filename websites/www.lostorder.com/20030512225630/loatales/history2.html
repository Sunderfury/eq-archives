<p align=left><b>The First Written History of the Order</b><br><i>by Zari</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Long before the arrival of the Dark Lord Mondain, there existed an ancient monastic Order of Akalabeth. The members of this Order were prophetic and advised Lord British in the way of all manner of things to come to the land. The Order foresaw the coming of Mondain and devised a plan to protect the wisdom and power of the Order. </p>

<p align=left>A great Sorcerer, Aeros, a member of The Order’s High Council, split The Shard of Light from The White Light, creating a separate aspect of The White Light. The Order became the keepers of The Shard, which they would take to a new land. By removing The Shard, the full power of The White Light could never be usurped by another and used against Lord British and his people.</p>

<p align=left>The High Council of The Order used The Shard to leave Sosaria and make a new home in Byleria. When the time was right, The Order would return to Lord British, bearing The Shard and bringing wisdom and great power back to the people.</p>

<p align=left>The Order left Sosaria with heavy hearts but great hope. They knew even then that dark times would come to Sosaria for many generations and that they would never see their homeland again.</p>

<p align=left>This generation of The Order came to be known as The Architects. They created a new home for The Order in Byleria where they could flourish and amass power, biding time until their return to Sosaria. The Architects created a book, The Oracular Tome, to guide generations of The Order through the events to befall Sosaria and to foretell the return of The Order to its rightful place, alongside Lord British.</p>

<p align=left>The Architects were an elite circle. Byron the Mysterious, a wizened mage, led the group. Within their ranks, the Sorcerer Aeros supplied great magic and helped to forge the plans for the future. A powerful paladin, Errana, led the forces of The Order to many victories. The Architects created legend with their piety and following of the course of The Light.</p>

<p align=left>Through their great magic, The Architects lived far beyond normal mortals, guiding the members of The Order for many generations. </p>

<p align=left>Even the power of The Shard, however, could not keep death at bay forever. Their greatness continued through their bloodlines, passing down wisdom, magic, and might.</p>

<p align=left>The Oracular Tome describes the coming of a dark Lord who would bring great strife to their homeland. The Architects foretell the coming of an evil Sorceress, and the rise of a creature neither human nor machine. According to The Tome, this Age of Darkness would last for many years. It also promises the coming of a great hero who would repeatedly come to the rescue of Lord British and would establish an age of chivalry and enlightenment.</p>

<p align=left>The Tome contains prophecies of many things. Of gargoyles roaming Sosaria, of mysterious Moongates, of Shadowlords, of a force known as The Guardian and of an evil Fellowship. Most important of all, The Oracular Tome tells of The Time of Heroes, when The Order would return to Sosaria, bearing The Shard of Light, to bring peace to the land. </p>

<p align=left>Many years after the death of the Architects, the people of The Order began to lose their way and forget why they had come to Byleria. Quarrels divided the people and many turned from the Light. During this age of Darkness, a small cadre of believers went onto seclusion, taking the Tome and the Shard with them.</p>

<p align=left>This cadre trained hard in the ways of fighting and of magic, never straying from the path set forth by the Architects. The members watched for the signs of the Time of Heroes and waited. Once the signs came to be seen, they returned to the people of Byleria and began to bring them back to the path of The Light. The cadre was led by Frederick Jackson, known as Freejack, a descendant of the great mage, Byron, who had become keeper of The Shard. At his side, Brimstone, descended from Aeros and a great Sorcerer himself, helped to guide the people back to the path of The Light. And Carnifex, a ranger, stood alongside them to fight for right and protect the Tome and the Shard, in the tradition of his great ancestor, Errana.</p>

<p align=left>The Time of Heroes has come. The signs have finally fallen into place. The members of this guild, now known as The Lost Order of Akalabeth, have returned to this aspect of Britannia using The Shard to right the Evils that still lie therein and be reunited with Lord British.</p>

<p align=left>Woe unto whosoever may stand in their way.</p>
