<p align=left><b>Report To My Mistress Concerning The Events In Najena</b><br><i>by an earth elemental</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The struggle against the invaders is proceeding as planned, You who brought me forth. They
were lulled into a false sense of security when they easily sent scored of your lesser summonings
back to the elements that they were made of. The ogre mercenaries you hired to guard false
treasure depots fell easily as well, although occasionally they would put up a good fight.</p>

<p align=left>Lead by one of those monstrous beasts known as Trolls, the invaders begin to realize the error
of their ways and foolishly halted in what they thought was a secure area. Little did they know
you had planned their every move! If only you could have seen the dismayed expression on
their faces as a horde of your greater summoned beings swamped down upon them, aided by
the large, black clad mercenaries. We caught them just as they had let their guard down and
nearly succeeded in slaying them then and there...but alas they proved to be competent warriors
and we were forced to rethink our tactics.</p>

<p align=left>I am proud to report that we did, however, manage to slay two of the interlopers: one of those
curious, tree worshipping magic users (an elf i think) and some fool that was playing an instrument.
Can you imagine that? Playing music in the middle of a fight...must be a beloved idiot kept 
around to amuse them around the campfires with silly antics.</p>

<p align=left>But as I said, the fight was somewhat of a...disaster. A good number of elementals and Ogre
mercenaries were slain, as were a handful of your lesser magi. We chose to fall back then and
regroup, allowing those animated potted plants of yours to occupy the attention of the band
of invaders. We began to send out elementals in pairs and singly to harass and annoy them,
to great effect. This is the copy of their conversation, as near as could be recounted.</p>

<p align=left>The orange clad troll "ARRRGGH! Deez tupid earth tingys keep attackin den runnin aways. Wy
they not stay an die lyk ther brothas?"</p>

<p align=left>"It seems we are the victims of Guerilla Warfare." (that was the drum banging idiot)</p>

<p align=left>"You idiots...can i not trust you to do anything correctly? A mere moment or two so i may 
regain my composure is all i ask, but no. Stand aside Dukot." (one of those dark skinned elves
who the others seemed to fear a bit)</p>

<p align=left>From there, we had less success as the dark skinned elf would cast some sort of dark magic that
froze the things we sent after them, preventing their escape to fight another time.</p>

<p align=left>Finally, however, we managed to force them to retreat beyond the confines of your temple of
glory...with some aid from the vicious plants and that pet frog of yours. We stand ready to 
repel other interlopers and await your help.</p>
