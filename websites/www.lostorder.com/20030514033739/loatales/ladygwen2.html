<p align=left><b>Construction of the Sou Stone</b><br><i>by Lady Gwen</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Standing over the body of a Lich Gwen reached down to see what was contained in this Lich’s Robes. </p>


<p align=left>“hmmmm, Necklace, wand, gold and whats this?,” Standing up and examining the fist sized gem Gwendolyn’s jaw dropped open. “Great gods of Sosaria.” In her hand Gwen held the largest Gem she had ever seen. It was a diamond, a brilliant diamond that Captured the light in such a way that a small glow of fire could be seen in the center on the gem. No Matter which way she turned it she could still see the fire dancing, glowing in the center of this magnificent rock. This was exactly what she was looking for! This would be the Gem in which she would use to combine Mary and free her from what seemed like the many personalities that she had. For in Gwen’s exhaustive studies of souls she had concluded that despite the fact that Mary seemed to have many different personalities they could be combined. It was with this knowledge that Gwen felt she could free Mary of her eternal childhood. Thus Solving a problem that had plagued Mary. She would design the stone to capture all of Mary’s many personalities and combine them, thus allowing the adult child to grow up. </p>


<p align=left>Rushing back to her Lab she went to work. Placing the stone in a holder so that she could see all its sides she studied the gem for quite some time. She counted 72 sides. She recognized that 7+2=9 and 9 meant the end. “Perhaps an end to this eternal childhood ,” she thought. </p>


<p align=left>Fasting for 3 days before her work was to begin on the stone she quieted her self in every way she could. Meditating long hours only getting up to put more Garlic and Mandrake root on to burn and smolder. She would only rest when she absoulutely needed to. On the third day she borrowed a tome from Maegara that contained some ancient Mantras. Reciting the Light Mantras, porting the energy through her body out through her hands and over the stone she began the long process of enchanting the item. She spent 3 days and nights working her magic preparing the Diamond for its intended purpose. On the dawn of the third day the white light in the center of the stone began to change. By night fall it had became a brilliant bluish green light that pulsated as if yearning to do its intended work, and if one was quite and held their head close they could hear a faint humming noise that was being emitted from the center of the stone. </p>


<p align=left>Pulling a portion of mutton from the oven she sat down and Leaned back in her chair and looked at her work. </p>

<p align=left>“This will most certainly do,” She thought, whist a half smile playing across her face she admired the light that pulsated from within. “Now comes the hard work, how should I approach this. Maybe cornering her in the Brewman is the best place…..no, to risky. Perhaps just follow her home, but keep a safe distance. Yes that is it, I will follow her when she leaves next time I see her. I do not want anyone else to be caught up in this.” Drinking the last of her water and finishing her Lamb she got up and went to her bed. Pulling the covers to her bed she layed down. “Tomorrow, I will follow her. Tomorrow will be a day to rejoice, for the tormented little girl will cease. She will be cured.” </p>

<p align=left>With that our tired mage drifted off in to a much needed slumber.</p>
