: &quot;I dont think any skill should be gm'd in a matter of hours... but a decent increase over time would be nice &quot;

: well..  i did my peacemake and provo and music when you could macro them...  6 hrs to go from 0 music to GM music...  after i got gm music it took 3 months total of heavy attended macroing to GM both the other skills.  3 MONTHS
: saturdays i would generally macro peacemake for 6-8 hours and sunday would be provoke..  everyone says how hard skill is to gain and how slowly it gains...  when you hit the 3 month point and you arent extremely close to GM peace and provoke then you can talk and i will be sympathetic to you.. untill then... well..  i dont horribly care.
