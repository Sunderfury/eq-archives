<font face = "verdana" color = "#00FFFF">Posted by <a href="mailto:tcraven@supernet.com"><b>Santiago</b></a> on July 27, 2000 at 17:27:47:</font><p>
<font face = "verdana" color = "#FDD1B0">“Santiago, yer a darn fool.  Look at yerself.  One smile from a lady’s sweet red lips, one hint that she’s in some sort o’ trouble, and yer heart is sold – sold, sworn and skewered.  This lady standin’ next to ye...she ain’t no commoner.  Do ye not notice the way she talks, the way she’s dressed?  She’s a noblewoman, or I’ll be hanged.  What’s she gonna say when she finds out who ye are?  She probably won’t say nothin’; she’ll just walk straight out o’ the room, and that’ll be the last time ye ever see her again.  Ladies like that don’t take up with seafarin’ rogues like yerself.  Mark me words, yer chartin’ a course straight fer misery.  Darn it, Santiago...are ye even listenin’ to me?  ‘Course not, ye darn fool.  Ar!  Why the heck do I even bother?”<p>	The voice of reason lapsed into sullen silence.  Santiago had heard every word, but heeded not one of them.  He knew he was being foolish; he knew all of the reasons why he shouldn’t be here with her.  But what did reasons matter?  When he looked at her, the part of him that should have known better just went straight overboard.  Gone was wisdom; gone was caution.  There was only her.  And with every step they took together through that dark garden, he knew he was losing his heart to her.  It wasn’t even a battle – more like a quick and willing surrender.<p>Angelic, those blue eyes – the color of sapphires, or ocean waves.  His imagination could not have painted her hair in a more pleasing color – sultry dark red, a series of elegant autumn ringlets that he longed to touch and unravel.  To think that she was here with him, that it was her arm intertwined with his – no, impossible.  It had to be a dream.<p>	No…it was the mask.  She did not know who he was.  She believed him to be some sort of knight in disguise, having rescued her from Duke What’s-His-Name at the bridge only an hour ago.  What would she say when he took off his mask and told her his name, revealing himself to be a dastardly rogue who was wanted for murder?  He was not looking forward to that moment.<p>	Elizabeth walked silently across the veranda, her gaze alternating between the brightly-lit windows of the hall and the murky shadows of the garden beyond the veranda.  It seemed to Santiago that she was trying to make a decision, and he respectfully maintained his silence.<p>	She sat down on a stone bench near a gurgling fountain in the shape of a seahorse, quietly gesturing for him to join her.  His heart was beating faster than normal as he sat down beside her, anxiously waiting to hear what she wanted him to do.  His original purpose in coming here – to find the assassin who had murdered his friend, Lucero – was all but forgotten.  He had not forgotten his promise, but it was a promise to the dead, and the dead could afford to wait a bit.<p>	“I assume you’ve heard of Rastalle, the duke of Trinsic?”  Her voice was quiet, almost sorrowful.<p>	“Aye, I have.  He’s one o’ the most powerful men in Britannia.  They say he’s even got his eye on the throne.”  At least that was what Lucero had told him, on that fateful night in Britain.<br> <br>	She looked at him sharply.  “Who told you that?”<p>	Santiago shrugged.  “Just a rumor I heard from somewhar.”  Actually, it was Lucero who had warned him against Rastalle, on that fateful night back in Britain.  It had been just a few weeks ago, but somehow it seemed as though years had passed since then.  “But why do ye ask?  Ye think thar’s some truth to the rumor?”<p>	“It’s possible.  Lord British has not been seen for some time now.  The kingdom needs a king – someone who has the best interests of the people in mind.”<p>	“Someone like Rastalle, ye mean?  From what I hear, he’s a cruel, dark-hearted bloke...one who’s only made happy by power and wealth.”<p>	“You’ve just described most of the men in Britannia.”<p>	“Aye, maybe.  But ye don’t see most men plotting to steal a crown that ain’t theirs.”<p>“What about taking a crown from an inept and absent ruler?  Is that treason or necessity?  Someone has to take charge, and who else do you see rising to accept that responsibility?”  She shrugged.  “But you seem inclined to judge my father as a villain.”<p>	The word came at him like a bucket of ice water.  “Your…father?”<p>	“That’s right.”  She reached up and removed her mask.  “I am Elizabeth, daughter of Rastalle, heir to the rule of Trinsic – and perhaps even more than that, if my father is successful.”<p>	Santiago barely heard what she was saying.  He simply sat there and stared at her face.  It was as though the last few puzzle pieces had suddenly fallen into place, revealing the entire, beautiful picture. He had seen her before, somewhere.  But where?<p>	And then, in a single lightning stroke, he remembered.  She had been reclining on a couch, a book in her arms.  When she looked up at him, their eyes met for just a moment before Santiago bashfully averted his gaze.<p>	“Her name’s Betsy,” Lucero had said.  Betsy.  Elizabeth.  The daughter of Duke Rastalle.  What had she been doing in the cellar of the thieves’ guild?<p>	Words came back to him, like echoes from the darkness of the past.  “I must always be on my guard against assassins,” said Lucero, pouring a precautionary antidote into his glass of wine.  “Even my own men would enjoy a chance to take me out of the picture.”  His own men...or his own women?  Lucero had been an influential figure in Britain, but his loyalty was to the king.  Rastalle would have viewed him as an obstacle, a potential threat.  It would have been a simple matter to send an assassin, someone who could beguile her way into his company, waiting for just the right moment to strike.  Someone like the beautiful, deadly Elizabeth.<p>	“Is something wrong?” she asked.  “I imagine you’re a bit surprised.”<p>	“More than a bit, milady.”  He tried to keep his voice normal, though he felt he was on the verge of tears.<p>	“You can see why I enjoy wearing masks, can’t you?”<p>	“Indeed I can, milady.”  She had worn a mask the night when she stabbed Lucero and nearly ended his own life with that blade of hers.  And she was wearing a mask even now, playing the part of this lovely young princess, deceiving him with half-truths.  Masks upon masks.<p>	“I hope I haven’t frightened you too much,” she said.  “Will you still help me, now that you know who I really am?”<p>	Who you really are.  He could not help but shudder.  This was no dream; it was a nightmare.  How could such beauty conceal such a wicked nature?  All the time he had been dancing with her, holding her in his arms.  It had been her head on his shoulder, her hand lightly caressing his back.  He had come here looking for a murderer, but the last thing he had expected was to fall in love with her.  Part of him still wanted to believe it wasn’t true, that he was somehow mistaken.  But no...it made too much sense.  He needed only one more test to know for sure.<p>	He took off his own mask, watching her face intently for signs of surprise or alarm.  He was not disappointed; her smile withered in an instant.  Her eyes widened at first, then contracted angrily as she hissed a single, icy word:  “You!”<p>	“Aye, it’s me, milady.  Still alive after all, much as ye might wish it otherwise.”<p>	“Your life will not last very much longer.”  Santiago had once heard a poet describe a voice “dripping with venom”, but he had never heard such a voice until now.<p>	“Oh, I dunno, milady...I’m awful hard to kill.”<p>	“We’ll see about that.  You managed to escape me in Britain, but you won’t get away so easily this time.”<p>	“Aye?  What makes ye so sure?  Are ye hiding a blade somewhar in that fancy dress o’ yers?  A blade like this, maybe?”  He drew the enchanted dagger and watched as it pointed straight toward her.  Vyktr had been as good as his word.<p>	Betsy showed no sign of fear; instead, she coolly stood her ground and squinted at the ornate weapon.  “I believe that belongs to me.”<p>	“So it does,” said Santiago.<p>	What happened in those next few moments was a big, sloppy blur.  He remembered drawing his arm back, the glittering knife held poised in his hand, ready to fly through the air and into the heart of its cruel, lovely owner.  But at the last moment, he hesitated.  In what seemed like slow motion, the knife clattered harmlessly to the ground, even as she cried out for the guards.<p>	He remembered running for the shadows at the far edge of the garden, vaulting over the barbed iron gate as if it was only four feet high.  His running footsteps thudded through the deserted sandstone streets, his black cape fluttering behind him.  With every labored breath, he cursed himself for being an idiot.  He had botched a perfect opportunity for ridding the world of a murderess.  Lucero’s death went unavenged, and he found himself running through the streets, a fugitive once more.<p>	But in his mind, he could still see her smile.  A playful little half-smile which, despite himself, he longed to see again.<p>	“Santiago, yer a darn fool.”<p><br>(to be continued...)<br></font>
