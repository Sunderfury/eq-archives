<p align=left><b>An Old Man's Task</b><br><i>by Muerian</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>A chill wind blew over Norrath as Muerian and an old man entered a small hut well off the beaten path in the forest.</p>

<p align=left>Muerian gazed into the embers of a dying fire as he absent-mindedly tossed a few brands onto it in an attempt to revive it - and his own spirit. The old man he'd met a few hours ago puttered around the small hut, preparing a small meal to break their fast of the last few days.</p>

<p align=left>Of course, he hadn't *meant* to come to the Lesser Faydark...not to stay. There was something about this old man that compelled him to help.</p>

<p align=left>And he just couldn't *stand* faeries...but then the feeling was mutual, wasn't it?</p>

<p align=left>"Eat, my friend. It's not much, but it'll keep your bones together," said the old one, handing Muerian a simple wooden bowl.</p>

<p align=left>"Thankee, old man. Too bad the faeries delayed us, or we would've been here much earlier," Muerian said. "What's your name? I can't keep on calling you old man!"</p>

<p align=left>"Ah...But then, what do names really mean. A sword is a sword then, no matter what you call it..."</p>

<p align=left>It must've been the old man's words that did it, for Muerian noticed an old, weathered sword on the wall he couldv'e sworn wasn't there a minute ago. It looked to be well used, the kind of patina on the grip that comes from a trusted weapon used for years. But it was oddly fashioned, in a style much different - more graceful - than the swords he was used to handling.</p>

<p align=left>As he peered around the room, he saw many things he had missed before. Odd kits with a red cross on them...clothing unlike any he'd seen worn in Norrath before.</p>

<p align=left>But his gaze always came back to the sword, as if it called to him.</p>

<p align=left>"Ah! You have seen my old practice weapon, I see. From time to time I go through the old forms, just to keep my body and spirit in tune. It's alright...take it...feel the weight and balance of the yaoji." The old man blinked and gave a little smile as he motioned for Muerian to take the weapon down from the wall.</p>

<p align=left>"A...Yaoji, you said?" Muerian pondered the heft of the weapon. It felt like an extension of his arm. He immediately realized that this was an artist's sword - er, yaoji. The blade seemed to almost have a desire to do what Muerian wanted - but in a more graceful fashion.</p>

<p align=left>Muerian placed it back on its pegs, but the old man demurred. "No. You handle my old practice yaoji as if born to it. Keep it and practice. You may have need of it where you are going."</p>

<p align=left>Muerian glanced sharply at the old man as he buckled the sword around his waist. "Where am I going? I thought this hut was the culmination of our little journey!"</p>

<p align=left>"You have so many questions, my curious bard...but I have not the time to answer. A shadow is growing, and your comrades need you." The old man glanced through an old book, muttering words that stayed maddingly just below Muerian's ability to hear them.</p>

<p align=left>"My comrades? Why did you not tell me?! I must be away to join them on Antonica!"</p>

<p align=left>"STAY!" the old man thundered. Muerian hadn't known the old man could still produce that kind of volume.</p>

<p align=left>"Your friends are not on *this* world, Muerian. You will have to trust that the Tome and Shard will reveal them to you when you arrive in Dereth." The old man gestured and Muerian's vision blurred, then faded altogether.</p>

<p align=left>****</p>

<p align=left>He awoke some time later, in a pool of soft sunlight, and the chirping of birds. As he looked up, he noticed that the sky was not like any in Norrath. He stumbled over to a pool of water to refresh himself, and caught a glimpse in the liquid's reflection. "What has happened to me, old man?" he croaked - and then realized that his voice was different, the timbre and resonance that he had cultivated as a bard was gone. </p>

<p align=left>Not to mention his hair. It was gone! He looked around at the springtime glade, and knew he was not in Norrath anymore. The old man had mentioned something about a...Derrth?</p>

<p align=left>He noticed a note rolled up in his belt. He quickly unrolled it and read:</p>

<p align=left>Muerian-
I hope you do not hate me for 'abducting' you in this way, but I had no choice. You will find that you are no longer a half-elf. The majik that transported you to this world has changed you to more closely resemble the people of this world. I have given you a name that will arouse no curious glances - Li Muer.
<br>I have been looking for those who have the mettle to protect Dereth from those who would corrupt and pervert it for evil. Once I sensed the spark of the Tome and Shard in you, I knew you were up to the task.
Others of your order have preceded you to Dereth. The Shard will have to show you the way, as I cannot. I am sorry, but I have too many worlds to search - and time is something I have too little of.
<br>
-A</p>

<p align=left>Muerian carefully folded the note and tucked it into his belt. "So...all things old are made new again, hmm?"</p>

<p align=left>He noticed a sign next to a path:</p>

<p align=left>Yanshi --></p>

<p align=left>"Well, I guess I'll start there."</p>

<p align=left>As he set off down the path, whistling almost in tune with the birds.</p>
