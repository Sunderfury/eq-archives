<p align=left><b>Adventures In A Winter Wonderland</b><br><i>by Jediit</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The ice creaked ominously as a large and hairy wooly mammoth crossed the frozen river above 
my still form. The icy waters swirled about me like currents of frozen pain, but Raveneye had
told me about wearing closefitting sealskin garments to keep the water out, so I was lucky
enough to avoid the fate of the unfortunate bodies i saw frozen at the bottom of the river.</p>

<p align=left>I grinned broadly up at the hairy elephant from in my little bubble of air and bellowed a greeting
to it, as only a bard can. The ice shook and the frightened beast dashed off, looking about it
for the sight of the massive noise it had heard. You would think such a large creature would
be less terrified of a little bit of noise, but Trolls are like that too. If you sneak up behind a
troll carefully and then yell in its pointy, rabbit like ears, they will jump like a human housewife
at the sight of a dirty rat. *rubs his ribs painfully* but i would not recommend that to any
but the most hardy of souls..(or the most curious)</p>

<p align=left>The momentary distraction of the beast's crossing behind me, i turned back to my careful
inspection of the riverbottom. Someone had told me sometime that there was a treasure 
under the ice, but all i have been able to find are frozen bodies. Maybe that is the treasure...
although not much of one.</p>

<p align=left>Eventually, i decided that it was time to go meet Diencet. We were supposed to be forming
a massive assault force to slay Lady Vox or something. I was looking forward to meeting this
ancient dragon and had brought my best harp to impress her with my songs. Dragons are 
extraordinarily fond of music and are known to reward those lucky bards that find them with
lavish gifts. Although you would think that more people would find her, since everyone knows
where they are...*Shrugs*</p>

<p align=left>Diencet laughed when I told him my plans and asked who had told me the secret. You have
never seen anyone laugh as hard as Dien did when I told him. for some reason,he thought it 
significant that Timbo the OgreLover had told me, which might explain the evil grins and 
surpressed laughter of the halfling.</p>

<p align=left>Just as we were about to go get a mug of warm mead in McQuaids in Halas, a train of
miserable looking figures lurched out of the driving snow and into the secret passage that
leads to the icy caverns where Lady Vox lay waiting for my music. The blue armor of Slaydar
peeked through the swaths of fur that covered him to ward of the cold. Behind him, attached
to a robe tied around his waist, was the dimunitive form of Brega, the slightly more massive 
form of Liam, and a little,unhappy looking bundle of fur and robes known as Dorry.</p>

<p align=left>Well, it is hard to describe the many battles we fought during the night, but they basically 
consisted of a handful of greenish skinned goblins being lured into attacking the "lone" figure 
of Slaydar. Slaydar would then lead them into the secluded alcove or room we were in and 
the poor goblins would be mercilessly slaughtered and ripped asunder by powerful magics. </p>

<p align=left>No sign of that Ancient Dragon, but I am still looking. I did have a nice theological 
discussion with some sort of goblin preacher, but then Slaydar's bloodlust won him over and
he attacked and killed the poor thing. Believe it or not, the thing had a nifty little crown that
Dorry and Taewinn (sp) (who had replaced Diencet when he had to leave) were almost 
fighting over. They rolled dice and Tae won.</p>

<p align=left>It has been a successful night, but i really want to see that Dragon! or at least one of her 
kind Ice Giant priests. *shrugs* maybe she is hiding near that Archaeologist some people were
talking about, maybe not. </p>

<p align=left>We are returning there this afternoon, so I will resume my search then.</p>
