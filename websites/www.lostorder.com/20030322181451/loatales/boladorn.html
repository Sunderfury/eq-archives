<p align=left><b>The Measure of Wealth</b><br><i>by Boladorn</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Boladorn stepped into the dim smokey room of the Seafarer's Roost. His stomach was still churning from the boat ride from Faydwer. </p>

<p align=left>He stepped up to the bar and ordered a blackburrow stout to calm his nerves and quiet the ogres bashing around his stomach. </p>

<p align=left>He looked around the room as his eyes adjusted and took note of the patrons of the bar. A gnome and a dark elf shared a quiet corner of the bar, their quiet conspiratorial whispers a buzz in the back of his mind. </p>

<p align=left>In the dining area a disheveled and tired old bard sang off key songs in tribute to the militia of the city while others sat smugly at their tables, more interested in their drink than the music. </p>

<p align=left>Boladorn took a table near the back of the room and placed his pack at his feet. He reached down and removed his mandolin from it's case. As he did so, the old bard glanced at Boladorn and gave an approving nod. </p>

<p align=left>Quietly, so as not to disturb the song, Boladorn checked the tune of his mandolin and began an accompaniement to the bard's song, quiet at first but building as his fingers lost their sea-faring stiffness.</p>

<p align=left>The old bard soon regained some strength in his voice, patrons lifted their heads from their mugs, and toes could be heard tapping. </p>

<p align=left>Boladorn and the old bard played several sets, coins clinking to the floor, and drinks provided by the barman. A dour and surly looking dwarf stumped in some time after sunset and took a table in the corner. When the bard sang songs of the militia again the dwarf spat on the floor and shouted "Bah! them militia heathans are na more than hired thugs they arr" </p>

<p align=left>The old bard called for a break in the hopes that the dwarf would drink his fill and leave. Boladorn cased his mandolin and walked over to the dwarf's table and sat down. </p>

<p align=left>The dwarf blinked in surprise at the affrontery shown by the self inviting bard. "Rude one aint ye?" slurred the dwarf. "Boladorn by name, barding's my game good dwarf" he replied. "Let me buy you a drink and ye can tell me your woes with the militia" said Boladorn. </p>

<p align=left>"Groflah I be, Groflah Steadirt, the swill here will do fine I suppose, too bad they havna Tumpy Tonics" he sighed. </p>

<p align=left>Boladorn brightened and smiled a wide toothy grin at the dwarf. "Yer in luck good dwarf!" he chuckled as he reached into his pack and brought out a case of the aforementioned drink of preference. </p>

<p align=left>Drink after drink tonic after tonic the two shared tales of battle and valor, of times past and fights to come in the future. </p>

<p align=left>A resounding crash echoed from the entrance to the inn. The crowd hushed in an instant, several of the patrons scuttling for back doors or private rooms above. Oblivious to it all the bard and dwarf continued their boisterous tale spinning and sharing of drinks </p>

<p align=left>"Brigands" and "Mercanaries" were whispered about the room, the old bard looked upon the brazen and swaggering newcomers and said "Close enough, it be the Fire of Heavens clan. </p>

<p align=left>Boladorn and Groflah were too deep in their drink to pay attention much less care who was around, they continued their drinking and loud tale spinning. </p>

<p align=left>One of the newcomers looked upon the two with disdain, puffed up his chest and bellowed for the two to quiet down, that he had no desire to hear their tales. </p>

<p align=left>Wrapped in their own conversation the two heard not a word from the shaman. Like so many uncaring and overequipped of his bretheren he cared not for the lives of the innocent, the shaman readied himself and with a single casting of his magics, slew the bard's diminutive drinking partner. </p>

<p align=left>The backwash of heat and electricity knocked a stunned Boladorn from his chair and to the ground. Instant sobriety brought a clarity of mind only danger can.</p>

<p align=left>A stunned Boladorn watched as the shaman laughed and walked from the bar to join his bretheren outside. </p>

<p align=left>Groflah lay on the floor, his breath ragged and face pale. Deep wounds rent his body and nothing but ragged wisps were all that was left of his once proud beard. "Tell them.... Let them know what has happened to me" he whispered. </p>

<p align=left>Boladorn did his best to comfort the dying dwarf, listening as his one time friends breathed his dying words. "Go to the Knights of Truth..... let them kn..." </p>

<p align=left>Boladorn reached over and closed the small man's eyes. He looked up and everyone snapped their attention somewhere other than on him, making overt attempts at making sure they had no interest in him or events that had transpired. </p>

<p align=left>Disgusted at the total lack of empathy and the cowardice shown by the patrons, Boladorn grabbed his belongings and stalked from the bar saying a final silent goodbye to his new friend. </p>

<p align=left>Outside on the docks a crowd of the Fire of Heavens clan had gathered, along with a myriad of sycophantic fans enamored of the wealth and power these fiends seemed to have. </p>

<p align=left>Boladorn strode up to the crowd and cleared his throat. "Know you all this!... I fear you not, nor do I admire you. If I never slay a dragon, nor walk the plane of fear, if I never loot a rare item that so many would hold dear. I will be stronger and more powerful than any of you will ever know. I have something that none of you will ever have, and that is true friends, people that I can count upon in my darkest hours or my happiest of times. Whether I am a pauper or a noble they care not. I do not need to be able to provide them with opportunities of fortune to be their friend. May you choke on your items and power!" He spat. </p>

<p align=left>Not waiting for any response, Boladorn turned and walked away feeling somewhat better having said his piece. Singing a song of war he headed for the eastern gate and the desert beyond....</p>
