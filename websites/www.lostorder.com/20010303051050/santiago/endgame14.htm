<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">A gentle breeze
wafted through the mountains, its warm breath hinting at the arrival of spring. Bats
circled overhead in the darkening sky, their tiny cries carrying faintly through the air
as they went in search of nocturnal prey. </font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">On a hillside near
the city of Kaladim sat a lone dwarf. A casual passer-by might have thought at first that
the dwarf was a statue, perhaps placed here by a whimsical sculptor. The dwarf did not
move, nor did he make a sound. He simply sat there, watching the sun as it fell past the
edge of the world, perhaps for the last time.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund closed his
eyes and listened to the sounds of twilight. The crickets had already begun to play their
music, as if on cue from the dying sunlight. The sound was everywhere &#150; the timeless,
tireless symphony of a thousand invisible miniature musicians.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;There you
are!&quot; came a voice from below. Bierfreund opened his eyes and saw Walterus, Kherghon
and Dargo climbing the hill. &quot;We&#146;ve been lookin&#146; all over for you,&quot;
said Walterus. &quot;What are you doin&#146; up here?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Thinking,&quot;
said Bierfreund.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Uh oh,&quot;
said Dargo. &quot;That&#146;s me least favorite activity. Always makes me head hurt.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Sounds like you
might be in need of ale,&quot; said Kherghon. &quot;Lucky for you we brought some!&quot;
He set down the barrel he had been carrying.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund smiled.
&quot;Bless yer hearts, fellas! &#145;Twould be a terrible fate to die sober.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Mugs of ale were
passed around.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Here&#146;s to
the end o&#146; the world,&quot; said Walterus.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;To the end
o&#146; the world!&quot; the dwarves echoed.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I guess
that&#146;s it, then,&quot; said Bierfreund. &quot;We really screwed up, didn&#146;t
we?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Kherghon shrugged.
&quot;I dunno. I&#146;ve always thought that if somethin&#146; is meant to happen, thar
ain&#146;t no way o&#146; stoppin&#146; it. Like death, or night, or becoming sober. Ye
can try to put it off, but it&#146;s gonna happen sometime.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund gathered a
fistful of dirt and poured it back onto the ground. &quot;Kherghon, yer a cleric, right?
Do ye think thar&#146;s life after death?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Darn&#146;d if
I know,&quot; grinned the priest. &quot;Brell Serilis forges us mortals out o&#146; dirt,
and we go back to dirt when we kick the bucket. But the dirt never dies, ye see.
Who&#146;s to say he won&#146;t see fit to forge us into somethin&#146; new some
day?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I&#146;d hate
to be forged into a gnome,&quot; said Dargo with a shudder. &quot;I&#146;d have to run out
an&#146; get meself killed again as soon as I could manage it.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The dwarves chuckled
in agreement.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Walterus raised his
flagon. &quot;Here&#146;s to life after death,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;To life after
death!&quot; said the dwarves.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Well,
that&#146;s it,&quot; said Kherghon. &quot;The ale is gone. What do we do now?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Let&#146;s go
fight somethin&#146;,&quot; said Walterus.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye, one last
battle,&quot; said Dargo. &quot;Let&#146;s go out with blades held high.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You
comin&#146;, Bier?&quot; asked Kherghon.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Aye,&quot; said
Bierfreund. &quot;I&#146;ll be right down.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The other dwarves
left, and the dwarf once again gazed upward to the darkening heavens. The night sky was
now the color of burning embers, slowly fading into gloom. He knew that this was the last
twilight he would ever see, and his eyes took in every minute detail. If there was nothing
after death, just an eternal sleep, then he wanted to remember this moment. For here, at
the edge of night, in the hills of his homeland, he was at peace.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">He could hear the
voices of the dwarves in the valley below. They were laughing &#150; apparently Dargo had
tricked the elves into fighting some lowland basilisks, and the elves were now statues
somewhere in the forest. They were planning to go and have a laugh at the expense of their
silly pointy-eared brethren.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Bierfreund got up and
went to join his friends. The four of them made a good team, and there was nothing better
than fighting side-by-side with fellow clan members who would gladly lay down their lives
for one another. With blades held high, singing a bawdy dwarven drinking song, they
marched off into the night.</font></font></p>
