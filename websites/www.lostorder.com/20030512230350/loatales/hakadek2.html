<p align=left><b>An Announcement and a Tale of Lies and Deciet</b><br><i>by Hakadek</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>The meeting with my Mother went as well as I had hoped, and better than I dared believe possible.</p>

<p align=left>We have my Mother's blessings, and Azyana has agreed to be my wife. Yet at this most joyous of moments there is still a dark cloud hanging over my thoughts. </p>

<p align=left>The service can only take place when I am free to speak my family name again with pride, so I set forth this narrative so that those close to us, our trusted friends may know a little more of the history that drove me to where I find myself today... with a wife to be, yet no date set for a Wedding.</p>

<p align=left>This history has been pieced together from the stories my Mother told as I grew up, and more recently, what I discovered as I neared the end of my training as a Cleric. . . </p>

<p align=left>I was born the son of an aspiring Blacksmith and his wife. </p>

<p align=left>My father Radek had long hoped that one day he would be able to open his own forge instead of working in the one owned by his wife's Uncle. Money came slowly and it seemed that he would never achieve his aim until the Orc wars flared up once again….</p>

<p align=left>With was comes a need for weapons and armour and of course Blacksmiths ..</p>

<p align=left>Radek soon realised that he was not going to make his fortune by staying at home and so when the King called for volunteers who would be well paid to go to the battlefields and work closer to the action Radek knew this was his chance. Leaving his young wife and their young son was hard, but he felt it was his only choice if he was to make their dreams come true and so he left for the front lines.</p>

<p align=left>Radek worked hard, harder than he had ever done in his life. There were few Smiths that far forward and the Warriors soon learned that Radek's work seemed to keep its edge longer and withstood the assault of the Orc's better. It did not take long before he had quite a following among the Warriors who would queue for his workmanship rather than accept the work of others. These things my Mother learned from his letters. Sadly this popularity made him no friends among the other Smiths and was in time to cost him and his family dear…</p>

<p align=left>The next news that Mother received was of the worst kind possible. There has been a counter attack by the Crushbone Orc's, and only a sungle survivor from my Fathers camp, and the survivor brought no good news. He told stories of how he had fought bravely and just barely escaped with his life while the other Smiths had just cowered in fright and had just surrendered at the first opportunity. Though the Warriors did not wish to believe these stories, he was the only survivor and those Smith's who's work had been eclipsed by Radek chose not to speak up, to their shame, so little by little his word was accepted as fact.</p>

<p align=left>The news from the front devastated Hadana. Radek's body was never recovered and she knew not if she was even a widow. Added to all this was the evil nature of the stories that filtered back from the front of Radek's cowardice. Under pressure from her Uncle she renounced Radek's family name but in her heart she never swayed from belief in her husband and swore that she would raise her son to believe in Radek and one day seek out the truth. The war eventually was won and life went on.</p>

<p align=left>The years past and I grew into a young man. Under my Mothers guidance I followed the path of a Cleric, a healer, though one not unaccustomed to the arts of war. As I neared the point at which I would complete my initial training a strange event came to pass. </p>

<p align=left>The Orc's had once more been stirring up trouble. In a swift and decisive manoeuvre the Dwarven army managed to penetrate deep into the heart of the very home of the Crushbone Orc's for the first time. There, they found to their horror the slave pits and mines that the Orc's had been filling with the victims of their aggression. There, barely alive they found an old Dwarven Blacksmith who had fought back killing his captors when he heard the Dwarven forces at the gates of Crushbone. He paid a heavy price for his rebellion and was gravely wounded just the Dwarves broke through. One of the Officers, a youth at the time of the previous war remembered a little of the loss of two Smiths and sought to question the poor soul. He was too weak to answer and so he was transferred with all due haste to the Cleric's Guild in Kaladim where by chance he came under my care.</p>

<p align=left>The gravely wounded Smith really stood no chance of survival, but under my care he did revive his spirits long enough for him to answer a few of the Officers questions. So it was then that Officer and I heard the true story of Radek's fate, as related here, from the dieing gasps of the old man. </p>

<p align=left>The old Smith and explained that he and a friend had fought well, many Orc's died that day at their hands, but they were eventually overwhelmed and captured. There had been another with them, but he had dropped his weapons and ran at the first sight of the approaching Orcs.</p>

<p align=left>The Orc's knew well the value of Dwarven workmanship and put them to work in the forges of Crushbone. They worked only under the threat that if they did not then more of their captured comrades would die horribly. Though they produced the worst work they could, it still exceeded that of the Orc's own Smiths, so they became valued and were kept alive long after others had perished. The Smith who survived managed to explain haltingly that his friend had been taken from him and traded to Orcs from another clan as part of a treaty of alliance. Almost beyond hope, but still unable to hold it back Hakadek asked falteringly for the name of the Smith's friend.. slowly and painfully with his last breath he replied…. 'Radek'…</p>

<p align=left>With the Old Smith dead and the only witnesses to the conversation myself and the Officer, there remained a problem. The coward that fled the battlefield had strong family connections and was now a merchant of some importance, this news of his true nature and of the bravery of Radek could not be told without further evidence. Vowing his support, the Officer returned to the Army and word slowly spread that Radek's son was to be offered all possible assistance, a few of the older soldiers guessed something of the truth but kept their mouths shut to avoid complications.</p>

<p align=left>I begged leave from his guild to begin my training in the field and it was granted. I went to my Mother and explained what I had heard. She was of course overjoyed at hearing that which she had always known, that Radek was no coward. However the uncertainty of his ultimate fate hung heavy upon her. I vowed that I would search for news of my Father as I travelled the world during my studies. As I left, Mother gave me her Wedding ring to carry with me as a token by which my Father would recognise me as she feared that too many years had passed for him to recognise his own son in the form of the Cleric that I had become. </p>

<p align=left>Her final words to me were… 'Bring my husband.. your Father home to me once more to place this ring back on my finger… or honour his memory and bring back a wife to wear this ring and our family name with...</p>
