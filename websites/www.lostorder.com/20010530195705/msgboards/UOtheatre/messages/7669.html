: My trouble wasn't with a bard character though.

: My dex-monkey/warrior type decided to pick up poisoning. So he wound up with the following skills:
: 100 fencing
: 100 tactics
: 100 archery
: 90 anatomy
: 75 healing
: 75 poisoning
: 95 alchemy
: and the rest in resist

: Now since I do tend to attack player-mages, resist is an extremely valuable skill.  I need to keep it and improve it.  But I can't have the resist and keep my other skills.

: So I found a couple people who do nothing but make potions cheap (having no &quot;mule&quot; space left).  I made a lot of the potions I could use for the next few months.  I think I'll wind up making several kegs of deadly poisons too so I could try to finish my poisoning with my own supplies.  And once I'm stocked up, I can drop alchemy for resist and poisoning.

: If it comes down to it later, I can alter another of my characters to add alchemy, but for my warrior, the ability to kick tail is more important.
