<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Fifteen</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Learning how to hunt, or should I say survive in Unrest has been very challenging. There is one certainty hunting there and that is death, but then again I find it something to quickly over come also. I have been so busy and frustrated and well trying to spend some time with my golden one that I haven't had the chance to sit and write. I made my way back to Kaladim so that I could deposit all the coin I had gotten, and sell a few good so I finally have a chance to write.</p>

<p align=left>It began the day my golden one and I traveled back home. Timbo kindly transported us to Butcher Block and cast SoW upon us. We thanked him and then my golden one led me home. </p>

<p align=left>I guess it had been too long since I have been home and I relied upon him to lead me around. The first thing that he did was lead us to the place we would rest at the Warrior's guild. He told me that we would be guest of the King. We would be staying at the Warrior's guild, an honor bestowed upon us due to his Father's noble actions. </p>

<p align=left>He showed me to the room I would be staying in and then the one he would. I was concerned about my surroundings and so he said he would not lock his door just in case I became unsettled during the night. He had to meet his mother and I needed to rest and make myself more presentable so that I would not embarrass him when we went to meet the King.</p>

<p align=left>When we met up later he asked me if I had ever gone to the palace. I did but by accident and did not enter. We walked in and down a corridor and then there was King Kazon Stormhammer standing there looking down upon us. He then said "May I present my companion Azyana. We come to offer our thanks for the honor accorded us by the way of our lodgings at the warrior guild.' I nudged him and reminded him to thank him for posting the guard outside my door. He did then added that he did not have news to bring to him about his Father and his ultimate fate' The King seemed to have a lot on his mind and did not say much. </p>

<p align=left>Next we visited the house where he grew up. It was near the forge where his father worked before he was drafted into the army. He seemed to be lost in memory when he smelled the fumes from the hot metal being cooled. I found it horrid. It was a simple home three beds and two chairs. He mentioned that since his father had left they had removed the third chair. I asked him which bed he slept in and he said the one furthest from the door, of course, so his father would not disturb him when he left for work. I could not help but smile at the image of him as a child sleeping in that bed. </p>

<p align=left>After a few more recollections of his child hood, he said it was time to go to Unrest. As we walked out, my golden one paused to say hello to Trantor Everhot who was going on about some Dwarven Wire. My golden one said ' Oh no, not still the Dwarven wire Trantor, give it up, nobody really wants it you know.' I just had to laugh… he is always giving friendly advice.</p>

<p align=left>I was following along as we made our way out of Kaladim and I noticed he was walking and pointed it out to him. He just said that ya can't run everywhere. Well, maybe for him who is already so old and learned so much but there was still a lot for me to do. I slowed my pace to his until we got outside then we made our way. We bound ourselves to the area just before the Cauldron. He lead me along the way showing me where the guards were that would keep me safe, the goblin camp which he told me I would have to make sure I kept my distance from, then we came to the entrance of Unrest. </p>

<p align=left>Upon entering he told me to get up against the wall, which provides relative safety even when a train passes since the undead will mainly stay in the middle and will not attack unless ya are fighting. He asked me to consider things here and there and a lot of them were below my abilities. While we taking a slight pause I asked him about all my training points I had remaining … 50 of them. His just said 'If you are careful to balance your development and not neglect skills, you may have little use for training points. If ya take up a trade then use them to train as far as possible, but even then ya will be able to put only 25 points into a trade such as Baking, Jewelry craft etc.'</p>

<p align=left>I asked him if he was trying to domesticate me. Then before he had time to answer I told him that I planned only to stay home long enough to tend to our children and then be back to do battle with him. He gave me a smile and just said 'I would have it no other way, my love'. Then it was back to the task at hand.</p>

<p align=left>First we walked around the house then entered it. He pointed out some thing like the fountains and the area about saying it was a good spot to pull to. To the left onto the West wall another good place to pull to. Before I knew it we were back at the front of the house. He brought me around room by room on the first floor pointing out where the undead hide. I tried to put on a brave front my I nearly wet my armor.</p>

<p align=left>Back out to the front where the fountain was and up against the wall there. He said that was the best place for me right now. So then we began. I followed him into the house where he had me consider some undead and when finding one of appropriate level he demonstrated a pull. Out the front door across the fountain he went with me following close behind to the wall. Then I would go after it. Once I finished, he explained that going across the fountain will hopefully cause the creature to go around it and then I would have a moment to cast root upon it. My initial root on it failed and he said to me that if I judged that I had enough mana to try to root it again. He went on to say that I should have DA close at hand and the zone is short run away. He also suggested that when I rest I should consider things that go past after I have regained my mana. It would give me an idea of the things I could hunt, and those that I should avoid. He did a few more pulls and then suggested I do one myself. Well what a mess. I went in pulled one went to the fountain to run through it when it promptly stunned me, and then my root failed and I ended up moving and attracting some death beetles. Well I pretty much could only melee until my golden one got rid of the beetle. I kept getting disrupted. I guess I had a look on my face since he said the only thing that I really did wrong was not pull far enough towards the hedges.</p>

<p align=left>Low in mana and health I cast invisibility vs undead and rested. As I did my golden one started to explain grouping. At this level my primary task is to buff the tanks and the puller if it is not a tank. Then I should focus upon healing during fights ad to stun or root a runner. Stun would be the first choice since it casts faster. The creature will most likely run when it is about down to 10% of health or sooner if it is suffering damage more quickly, so I should be ready to stun then. He said that I could check the creature by targeting the group member and the typing /assist but I have still have gotten that to work correctly. </p>

<p align=left>Days went by and my golden one rejoined his friends in Sol, visiting me when he could. On one of his visits I was in a group and he said that he would just sit back and watch. There was another cleric. I asked him what was done in that circumstance. He told me that the junior cleric usually is in charge of the healing and the other one for protective spells since they took more mana. Also this was done since with higher-level mobs the older cleric would be less likely resisted. He said there was a basic rule, if ya are standing ya should be casting, if not ya should be meditating. When ya are sitting then ya step back from the group a bit to sit and med in between casts. It also reduces the creatures attacking ya when ya med. He noticed one ranger Fiothas that kept a watchful eye over me. He whispered to me later that I should always make note of those type of people and pay extra attention to them. </p>

<p align=left>Another day I had reached my 18th circle with a group. It was such an exciting battle. By the end of it I had but 10hp myself but I had kept the rest of the group alive. We healed and meditated and during the next battle someone had brought a good size train upon us and I returned to the 17th circle. It took many a battle that day but I gained it back.</p>

<p align=left>Yesterday I was paired up with a warrior two circles my junior. We had an interesting time of it. In one battle I healed him and sat down to med and he goes and tells me, 'Sit in between and med'. I just told him that I was and he just couldn't see me. He was calling for heals and buffs but then after awhile he stopped. He knew that I was taking care of him. One pull was really funny. It started with two and then as soon as he got rid of one another would come. Near the end of the battle, I had healed him so much that I ran out of mana and assisted him in ridding the few beetles that remained. When I took a look around there were about five undead and six beetles lying all around us. We got more in our group and I teased him to not give me a headache like that again. I guess I left an impression upon him since he contacted me in another form and said that he wished to group with me again.</p>

<p align=left>My golden one is still with his fiends. Perhaps by the time he comes back I will have attained my next circle of knowledge.</p>
