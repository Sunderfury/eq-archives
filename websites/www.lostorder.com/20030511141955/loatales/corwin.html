<p align=left><b>The Charge of Akalabeth</b><br><i>by Corwin</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>It was party time, Akalabeth-style.</p>
	
<p align=left>Throughout the cities of Britannia, the call went out.  "HERE YE, HERE YE! UNVIRTUOUS TROLLS TERRORIZING THE FORESTS TO THE NORTHEAST!"</p>
	
<p align=left>The wealthy island city of Vesper was a stone's throw away from a Troll invasion, and once again the Brothers of The Lost Order of Akalabeth answered the call.  Truly a wonder of speed and organization, the valiant Warriors of Akalabeth converged on Vesper instantly, prepared for battle, ready for war.</p>
	
<p align=left>Present were Carniex, Stubby, Tasslehoff, Zirc, Akira, and I, Corwin of Amber. Gresandir, Red Death and others joined as soon as the call for action reached them. Accompanied by many stalwart fighters and mages from all over Britannia, the LOA charged forth to meet their destiny.</p>
	
<p align=left>The chaos, the anarchy!  Hordes of vile trolls assailed us as soon as we entered the forest.  Gone were the peaceful, gentle woodland animals.  The only life in the woods were the treacherous monsters billowing forth like some evil tide.</p>
	
<p align=left>"TO BATTLE!!!," cried Carnifex, tearing through the trees, leading the charge. There were so many trolls, a veritable army, and we seemed so few by comparison. But we were men! Hearty in our strength and adept in our ability, the clash of forces detonated far off volcanoes and put fear of Akalabeth into bloodthirsty PK's. It was the Unstoppable Force meeting the Immovable Object. Cries rang out, sword clashed with trollish axe, and man vanquished foul creature. The air was filled with energy, mages healing wounded comrades, and warlocks, arms raised high, wielding deadly Bolts of Energy. Our foes died and died and died! How many died, I know not, but the bodies of the fallen lay strewn about, like so much dirty laundry piled high in Mara's house.</p>
	
<p align=left>Many foes did we overcome, and much treasure was earned.  The Order of Akalabeth proved it's worth ten-fold that day.  Stubby battled two trolls alone and arose the victor. Akira blazed a path through many trolls, allowing others to rest and regroup. Zirc carved a mighty "Z" in the hides of all his vanquished foes (and there were many!). But amidst the confusion and carnage, something was amiss.</p>
	
<p align=left>"Corwin, have you seen Carnifex?," called Tasslehoff, finishing off another troll.</p>
	
<p align=left>"Nay sir, I have not," I replied. "He scouted ahead to see if there were more of the damned creatures waiting in ambush."</p>
	
<p align=left>"We must find him, Corwin.  We can never leave a brother unaided, especially when are foes are so many."</p>
	
<p align=left>"Aye Tasslehoff, thous hast the right of it.  Let us find brother Carnifex."</p>
	
<p align=left>The way was long, and the path difficult.  Many a troll did we pass in our search for brave Carnifex.  But signs of his passage were cold, and the milling of hundreds of our enemies nearby prevented us from stopping long enough to find his trail.  Northeast we did travel, Tasslehoff and I, evading ambush and attack, through the forests now far from Vesper, around the troll-infested peninsula until we came upon a village caught unsuspecting in the grip of a massive tribe of those creatures.</p>
	
<p align=left>Cries of "Guards! Guards!" rang out from the vendors and the people of this small village, and whilst Carnifex was still unaccounted for, the Honor of Akalabeth decided our  fate  these people needed us, and we would protect them from harm, though it mean our very lives.</p>
	
<p align=left>"FOR THE SHARD OF AKALABETH!!!," I cried, as mighty Tasslehoff and I raced  forward, catching our foes off guard, easily defeating them.</p>
	
<p align=left>"I fear that was, Corwin," said a concerned Tass, "I do not think  that was the last of them."</p>
	
<p align=left>"You are right, brother mine," said I, spying a cowardly troll running from his death, to the woods nearby.  Grunts and growls were heard, and the very ground shook in fear, but  we stood firm, awaiting our foes.</p>
	
<p align=left>Bursting forth from the trees came what must have been at least fifty blood-thirsty trolls.  Donning war paint and armed with poisonous weapons, they surged forth, sure in  their victory, confident in their power.</p>
	
<p align=left>The fools.  What are a handful of trolls to two such as us, the Pride of Akalabeth? They knew not what they did.  We came prepared.</p>
	
<p align=left>I drew forth my weapon, a magical Bardiche of Slicey-Dicey, just as Tasslehoff    pulled out his War Axe of Whoop-Ass.  We stood, back to back, against the masses.</p>
	
<p align=left>How the blood flowed, my brothers!  Skill and strength overcame brute size, and the trolls fell apart at the seams.  Body parts lay everywhere, piled around us in an  ever-growing heap, enough a tear to the eye of any AoD vendor.</p>
	
<p align=left>Our sight glazed over crimson in the heat of battle, we often traded steel for magic in  our continuing battle.</p>
	
<p align=left>"CORP POR!!!," chanted Tasslehoff, raining deadly energy down on our foes, the air alive around him.</p>
	
<p align=left>"POR ORT GRAV!!!," I screamed, a smell of ozone in the air as I pulled Bolts of Lightning from the sky, striking our foes.</p>
	
<p align=left>But alas, as strong as we were, the seemingly never-ending horde of trolls wore us  down, wounding our bodies, draining our mana.  Outlook not good, Grasshopper.</p>
	
<p align=left>But then:</p>
	
<p align=left>"Hail LOA!!!," came a cry.  T'was brother Zirc with Carnifex and others!  Many  Brothers of Akalabeth did he bring, as well as other courageous warriors of the land.  It was time to get medieval on some troll ass!</p>
	
<p align=left>But just as we felt in our hearts victory was assured, just as the final wave of  monsters were upon us, we were filled with trepidation, as an ominous voice rang through  the heavens.</p>
	
<p align=left>"FOOLISH    MORTALS!!!   YOU    KNOW    NOT    WHAT    YOU   DO!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"</p>

<p align=left>It was the voice of the dreaded Lag Daemon, and as our ears rang with maniacal laughter, our bodies grew slow and heavy, and we could battle no more.  The Lag Daemon had reared it's ugly head once again.  Entropy of the Body had set in, leaving our Spirit raging ineffectually inside.</p>
	
<p align=left>But what is the power of the Lag Daemon to the Spirit of Akalabeth?  It is a mighty  force, surely, but to a Brother of the LOA, Lag is an every day battle, and the Power of the  Shard resides in each of us, shining through in our time of need.</p>

<p align=left>"CURSE!!!   FOILED   AGAIN!!!   TILL   NEXT   TIME,    AKALABETH!!!!   AHAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!,"
and the voice of the Lag Daemon faded and was heard no more.</p>

<p align=left>Foes vanquished, village saved, and friends reunited, the Brothers of The Lost  Order of Akalabeth traveled home, through the once more tranquil forests.  Many woodland animals had already returned, and mighty wolves and panthers bowed to us in our passing.  It was a good day to be alive. </p>
	
<p align=left>We traveled back to our warm village near Yew, and were merry.</p>
