<p align=left><b>Wyndelle's Misadventures V</b><br><i>by Wyndelle</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Mooto looked on the ragged band of goblins that had been assigned to him. He scowled at each of them, intimidation and money being the only motivation that worked on them. “Yuz four, der be a furfoot deputy dat be alones in da wood neer hear. Go gets him and brin him back alive so wee kin eat gud tonite” sneered Mooto. “You four cum wit me, der be stories of a gnomy in da woodz hunting da orcies. Wit us 5 we shud be abel to kill him wit no getting hurt. You udders stay here an guard da way home” ordered the goblin leader. The goblins all gnashed their teeth and attempted their own version of a salute as they tramped of on their assignments. Mooto’s jaw was dripping saliva at the thought of fresh meat.</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle left the tower in high spirits whistling a tune he and his brothers used to use to pass the time on trails in the steamfont mountains. He was confident that he would again be in the company of his brothers. As bothersome as the could sometimes be he missed them dearly. “Master, do you think it wise that you make so much noise? There be evil afoot in the woods, and it would be better to go to them, than bring them to us” said the elemental.</p>

<p align=left>“Where’s the fun in that Geb? They would be no match for me an me magicks… The old man has taught me well” boasted Wyndelle. Gebarn shrugged his shoulders and followed him as they walked towards the cave that leads to the Runnyeye goblin maze.</p>

<p align=left>Wyndelle stopped as he heard a noise that seemed out of place. “What was that Geb?” Wyndelle asked nervously. “I heard nothing master” replied Gebarn. Wyndelle listened a moment more, then shrugged his shoulders and turned to continue on to Runnyeye and smacked into the belly of a tall goblin.</p>

<p align=left>“Looky looky at my feet, me thinks me find sumthin good to eat” said Mooto. Wyndelle jumped back a few paces and looked around. He was surrounded by 5 goblins including Mooto. “Gebarn! Take the warriors leave this one to me.” shouted Wyndelle as he began casting a spell.</p>

<p align=left>The two magic users faced off, exchanging spell after spell, neither gaining ground on the other. As he battled, Wyndelle could hear the strangled cries as each goblin warrior fell, one, then two, then a third. He could spare no more concentration to follow the battle’s conclusion.</p>

<p align=left>A lucky strike with his staff interrupted Mooto as he was completing a spell gave Wyndelle the opening he needed. Gathering his remaining strength he poured forth all his available energy and Mooto was pummeled by hordes of hungry blades. Mooto fell to his knees, a look of shock on his face, By sheer will alone he was able to stay on his knees long enough to look his killer in the eye, then he fell gasping his last breath.</p>

<p align=left>Exhausted, Wyndelle turned to see Gebarn’s body fading away, the last goblin having bested him. Without the energy to cast a spell, Wyndelle could do nothing as the runed staff slipped from his fingers as the goblin rushed him.</p>

<p align=left>Suddenly a flurry of movement from behind tree signaled the arrival of a new foe. The goblin didn’t notice or was so bent on Wyndelle’s destruction that he did not turn from his course. As the goblins axe descended towards his face Wyndelle closed his eyes accepting his fate.</p>

<p align=left>A scream of purest power rang out through the wood. “Wyrmkin!!!!!!!!!!!!” screamed the new arrival. Wyndelle opened his eyes in time to witness the fastest foot and hand work he had ever seen. The goblin was disarmed then his skull crushed before Wyndelle could take a breath. The goblin toppled and landed right on top of Wyndelle.</p>

<p align=left>“You’ll be fine lad yer okay… I’ll get you…..” the voice faded, Wyndelle’s sight faded…. Blackness.</p>
