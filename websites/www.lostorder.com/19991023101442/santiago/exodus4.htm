<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The shadowy figure
approached the fire, and Sarangoulis prepared to defend himself. If this was to be his
last moment &#150; even if this was Death itself come to claim him &#150; Sarangoulis did
not intend to die quietly. He would fight to the last breath, and perish with dagger in
hand.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">But things are not
always as they seem. The stranger drew back the hood of the cloak to reveal a
sun-weathered face with kind eyes and a pleasant smile.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Do not be
alarmed, good sir,&quot; said the stranger. &quot;I harbor no sinister intent. I was
simply passing by, and noticed your campfire. May I rest here a moment?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis lowered
his dagger with a smile of relief and waved his hand in a gesture of invitation. &quot;You
are welcome to rest here as long as you like. The fire is not mine; I merely built it. All
are welcome to share in its warmth.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Very kind of
you,&quot; said the stranger. &quot;But would you say the same to a villain? For all you
know, I might be a murderer. Mine might be a dark heart, and this smiling face could
disguise a cruel purpose.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis nodded.
&quot;But your words are true and wise, and thus lead me to believe that yours is not a
dark heart. And if you had a cruel purpose, it would most likely have been carried out by
now. Villains are typically devoid of art; their skill lies in weapons, not words.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Unless it
should chance that I am an uncommon villain,&quot; said the stranger. &quot;Are the words
of the Devil himself not silvered and sweet?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It is rumored
to be so,&quot; said Sarangoulis. &quot;But your appearance is somewhat less than demonic.
I have heard that the Devil is twelve feet tall, and that his skin is orange like
fire.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;And that he can
assume any form he wishes,&quot; said the stranger. &quot;What else have you heard?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis paused
nervously. &quot;He offers to grant people what they most desire&#133;at the price of
their souls.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">The stranger smiled.
&quot;Well then, I am not the Devil, for my price is not nearly so steep. Tell me,
Sarangoulis&#133;what is it that you desire, more than anything else in the world?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;You&#133;you
know me?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I know of you.
Until yesterday, you were one of the most powerful wizards in the world. Now stripped of
your title and power, you walk the earth as a mere man once again.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I was not aware
that the affairs of the Circle were common knowledge,&quot; growled Sarangoulis.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;They are
not,&quot; said the stranger. &quot;But there is very little that passes in this land
without my knowledge.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Who are
you?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I am called
Brimstone, if there is anything to be gained from a name.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis blinked
in surprise. Brimstone was the name of the shadowy leader of the Lost Order of Akalabeth,
an ancient order of knights and wizards. For ages, their members had been charged with the
defense of the High Forest surrounding Empath Abbey.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I am something
of a mage, myself,&quot; continued Brimstone. &quot;When I learned of your plight, I
decided to seek you out in order to present you with an offer. What would you say if I
told you that I knew the way to Norrath?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis raised
his eyebrows. &quot;You know the way?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I do,&quot;
said Brimstone. &quot;And I can show it to you, if that is what you truly want.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;It is,&quot;
said Sarangoulis.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;That was a
hasty reply,&quot; said Brimstone. &quot;Think, for a moment, upon what you are doing. All
the people you know, all the friends and allies you have garnered over the ages &#150; all
of them will be lost to you. You will be alone, in a strange new land.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I
understand,&quot; said Sarangoulis. &quot;I have weighed these thoughts in my mind a
hundred times during the past few months. My decision is unchanged.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Brimstone shook his
head and smiled. &quot;You are young, Sarangoulis. Not too long ago, I stood where you now
stand. I, too, felt my blood burn with the desire for new discoveries. Since then, I have
traveled all over the world. I have seen kingdoms rise to glorious heights and crumble
into oblivion. I have walked the world, from the icy lands of the north to the southern
isles where the rivers are made of fire. In all my travels, there is one simple lesson
that I have learned, perhaps more important than all the others combined. I have learned
that the world is a dark, lonely place if you do not have friends. Power, wealth &#150;
these are meaningless without the simple comfort of companionship. Think upon that before
you cast your eyes toward a distant shore.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis simply
nodded, his eyes still resolute. Brimstone smiled sadly &#150; perhaps where were some
lessons that could only be learned from experience.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;The gate lies
just over that hill,&quot; said Brimstone, pointing to the south.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis frowned.
&quot;That is the Moongate, is it not?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Brimstone nodded.
&quot;It is. But if you walk through at the stroke of midnight, when the twin moons lie in
perfect alignment &#150; as they do tonight &#150; the Moongate will take you to Norrath.
And Britannia, along with all of its people, will become nothing more than a memory to
you.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis looked up
at the night sky.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Yes, it is
nearly time,&quot; said Brimstone. &quot;Before you go, I offer you a gift.&quot; He
opened his hand to reveal a glowing crystal.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;A
lightstone?&quot; asked Sarangoulis.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Brimstone smiled.
&quot;In a manner of speaking. To some, it offers illumination, and serves as a shield
against many different kinds of darkness. For others, it burns to the touch, and they are
unable to even gaze upon its light for very long.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Sarangoulis took the
crystal, and looked at the swirling iridescent light from within. &quot;Magical?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Brimstone nodded.
&quot;This is one of the Shards of Akalabeth. Consider it a talisman of sorts &#150; a
ward against the various forms of evil that seek to injure or dominate.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Where did you
find it?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Deep within the
forests of the north, there lies an ancient, sacred vale. Within that vale grows an
enchanted tree, made of glass which never breaks, and ice which never melts. At certain
times of the year, if one knows the proper spells and incantations, a crystal may be drawn
from its frozen boughs.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;And I take it
that you know the proper spells,&quot; said Sarangoulis.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;I should hope
so,&quot; said Brimstone. &quot;After all, it was I who first planted the tree, ages ago.
And just as I gave it life, so too may you plant this Shard wherever you choose. By doing
so, you bind your spirit to that place. Thereafter, you shall be shielded from the lure of
the Void. Even if death itself stretches forth its talons to claim you, your spirit shall
return to this Shard, and you will be reborn in a new form.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;A valuable
gift, indeed. But why?&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;While you were
a member of the Circle, you participated in the defense of this realm. By sending you to
Norrath, I am sending a weapon against darkness. And there is darkness to be fought, make
no mistake. There are powerful, malevolent forces at work in that realm already, and you
must be constantly on your guard. If you find that you cannot persevere on your own, you
may use the Shard to find allies throughout the land. But you must make haste now, for
midnight is nearly upon us. Farewell, Sarangoulis, and remember what I have told
you.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">&quot;Farewell,
Brimstone. And thank you.&quot;</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">There was no more
time for questions; fate was beckoning once again. With a racing heart, Sarangoulis turned
and walked into the dark forest.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100"><font color="#0080C0">Brimstone was an
Earthmage; in his time, he had planted all kinds of seeds and watched as they grew from
ideas to reality. To him, the entire world could be seen as a garden, where some things
grow proud and tall, while others grow dark and twisted. Through his careful, patient
ministrations, he did what he could to make the garden a pleasant place to live in.</font></p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 100" align="left"><font color="#0080C0">Now, he
watched in silence as the shadows seemed to swallow the departing wizard. Once in a while,
he thought he could see a faint glimmer made by the Shard, and he wondered what would take
shape &#150; sturdy oak or stinging briar, it was sometimes difficult to tell which would
emerge from a simple seed. Only time would tell.</font></font></p>
