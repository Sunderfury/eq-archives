<p align=left>Captian's Log: Morningthaw 25</p>

<p align=left>Blimy, it hurts even to write today!  Tis a long tale the finds me
recoverin' me life's energies from the bottom of this mug of ale here at the
Royal Firkin.  Mayhaps I should begin at the begining.</p>

<p align=left>The 24th started sunny and bright, a wee too bright fer me likin' as I was
still feelin' the effects of the previous night "adventures".  Still I
wanted to make the most of a glorious day in spite of the pounding in me
head.  I was gettin' me energies up when a couple of familiar faces walked
into the Royal Firkin.  Seems Orion Red and Joxer the Mighty had found their
way to Rithwic fer me.</p>

<p align=left>Orion was new in the world so Joxer and I 'elp Orion get some decent armor
and such.  With that done we decided to set out fer a little adventurin'
(partly because I had run up another tab with the Royal Firkin and needed
the gold, and partly fer the sake of adventurin')</p>

<p align=left>Joxer wanted to show us both some of his favorite hunting grounds in Yaraq,
which ment two hops through those cursed portals.  Fortunaly fer me I didn't
have any breakfast that day.  It never ceases to amaze me that a hardened
sailer like meself gets sick from portal travel, but then again, there's
probably something with the magik in those things that doin' it to me.</p>

<p align=left>Well eventally we found ourselves just outside of Yaraq.  I'd never been to
this part of Dereth before, and I found the contrast quite startling at
first.  There's sand and such everywhere.  The weather here reminds me a bit
of Nu'Jelm, though the simularities stop there.  Still its a very nice towne
to visit, and I should think that I'll be headin' back this way some time in
the future.</p>

<p align=left>The three of us didn't stay long in Yaraq propor though.  Joxer had places
he wanted to show us.  First we took a look at some fields where a while
herd of cattle roamed free.  Seems these bulls put up quite a fight if you
pick one with them.  Next we hiked along the beach, Joxer wanted to show us
the old emperian crypts along the beach.  We just took a passing look since
the place is quite overrun with undead and drudges.  Next we climbed one of
the mesa's and found a set of festival stones.  Here we marveled at the view
and dreamed of sailing our fine ships into such a beautiful harbor.</p>

<p align=left>We stayed here for a while, sharing our dreams and ambisions for the Lost
Order and ourselves here in this new realm.  After a little while though the
wander lust started to take over again and Orion and I headed out to do a
bit of hunting together.  We started with those bulls just out side of
Yaraq.  This served as a warm up for what was to come.</p>

<p align=left>After a little while Orion decided that he'd had enough for one day and
headed off fer some ale and rest.  I on the other hand wasn't quite done
(mostly because I had yet to have a rude awakening at the nearest lifestone)
Just as Orion was getting ready to call it a night, Joxer was gettin' ready
to head out fer some hunting along the beach.  Also Montesque, our ole mess
mate happened to show up in the Yaraq area, and was looking fer a bit of
action.</p>

<p align=left>Well the three of us in our fellowship set out along the beach to the west
of towne.  Our first encounter was with a group of armadillows.  Now these
beasties didn't look too friendly to me, and as soon as we got upwind of
them they decided to attack us.  Mayhaps it had something to do with those
armadillow hide bracers I've got, though I'll never quite know.  We did
manage to put the three of them down without too much trouble, though there
were a few scares.</p>

<p align=left>We choose the keep going along the beach a little ways further.  Our next
encounter was with a blue wasp.  Now I figured those giant bugs make a great
taget fer a bow.  The next thing I know I'm sitting next to the Yaraq life
stone dusting the soot from me armor.  Still we once I caught back up we
figured we should carry on, after all one blue wasp was a fluke right?</p>

<p align=left>Next we came upon a water golum.  Again I notch arrow and made "friends"
with it at about 80 yards.  Somehow I think I should have started running a
little sooner, but as it was I started running after an uncerimonous trip to
the nearest life stone.  Still we weren't daunted in the least.  Next we
headed a little further inland and found a pair of grommies, well at least I
found the pair of grommies.</p>

<p align=left>This time I did run, but it didn't much matter</p>

<p align=left>Again I put meself back together at the Yaraq lifestone, and pounded sand
all the way back to the where I'd last left the land of the living.  This
time Joxer and Montesque asked, in no uncertian terms, that I lay back a
bit, and not make so many "friends" among the fauna.  This was before we
found the azure grommie and water golum together.</p>

<p align=left>Seems the two of them were having a friendly argument before we interupted.
One they caught wind of us, they decided to take out their agression on
yours truely.  I think Joxer was able the get the water golums undivided
attention.  I however was next on the grommie's menu.</p>

<p align=left>This time I made no pretence about fighting.  I jus started running.</p>

<p align=left>Well I was doing pretty good fer a while of avoiding that grommie's teeth
and acid breath.  At one point I thought I'd lost him, so I stopped to catch
me breath and bandage me wounds.  That was a mistake.</p>

<p align=left>So once again I started running, from the life stone in Yaraq.</p>

<p align=left>Once I collected the last of me things, we decided that easier hunting
should be had fer a while.  We opted to clear out the crypts of all their
undead evil.  First though we had to clear out the drudges guarding the
entrance.  That actually proved to be an easy task until Joxer acidently hit
the wisp that was flutterng through the area.</p>

<p align=left>We all managed to survive that little "incident" and make it to the reletive
safety of the crypt.  We fought down there for most of the eve of the 24th
with reletivly few incidents.  Eventually even Joxer was gettin' tired so we
opted to call it a day.</p>

<p align=left>When we got out of the crypt we found the wisp still waiting for us.  And
unfortunatly fer us, it remebered.</p>

<p align=left>Now its said that wisps are smart, but this one was a genious!  Not only did
he remeber the three of us, but he went to take out the weakest first.  Well
that means that I ran all the way back to Yaraq with me bottom burnin' from
the force of the wisp's magik.  This time however I didn't stop to heal
until I was safely back at the Cerulean Cove, with a glass of ale in one
hand and a heath draught in the other.</p>

<p align=left>I rested the night, then high tailed it back to Aluvian territory first
thing in the morning.  Three portal hops later I'm back home at the Royal
Firkin.  I'm thinking of restin' a few days before I head out again.  The
life stones sure beat stayin' dead, but they do take a lot out of you,
especially after 4 visits in one day.</p>
