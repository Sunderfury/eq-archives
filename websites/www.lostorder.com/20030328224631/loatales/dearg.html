<p align=left><b>Adventures in Unrest</b><br><i>by Dearg Maul</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Wiping the sweat from my brow, I stomp through the ichor and gore trying to find a dry spot to sit down and meditate. By Brell, my next stay at Kaladim will be a pleasure, oh for a nice long gravel bath. I clear the bartop of various foul concoctions with a single sweep of my arm. Nobody should learn what those zombie nobles were drinking, especially the elves. Climbing onto the polished walnut surface of the bar, I make myself uncomfortable. Closing my eyes, meditations on the glory of Brell come easily. Through my concentration I can hear Walterus and Kwonryu complimenting each other on their skills, their mood lightened now that their wounds are healed.</p>

<p align=left>"Aye, twas a glorious battle, with many blows given and taken. Ye’ll have ta show me how to kick a monster's head off like that."</p>

<p align=left>Walterus grunts before I hear the crash of his boots against the ground. I picture his burly dwarvish frame trying to leap eight feet in the air but my imagination fails me.</p>

<p align=left>We hear cries for help from outside and leap to our feet. Quickly we follow Kwonryu as he dashes from the house of Unrest to the courtyard in front of it. I hum to myself and glance around for Undead as Kwonryu strikes up a conversation with another group of adventurers. Before I know it, Kwonryu has offered our services to rescue several fallen comrades who were defeated by the gaurdians deep beneath the basement. Shouting for heroes, we gather close to fifteen hardy souls willing to brave the danger. I pray for Brell to bless us all, and bestow his protective magics on everyone before we move into the house.</p>

<p align=left>My heart swells as I follow Kwonryu and Walterus as they lead our charge into the house. Crowding the bottom of the stairway, a wave of flame and steel overcomes two overmatched monsters at the entrance to the basement. </p>

<p align=left>We rest briefly before continuing deeper, the soothing sense of solid rock above my head a curious counterpoint to my fear of the unknown. Kwonryu gathers the warriors to him and they charge into the basement proper, crying out to their gods. Behind them, fire in their eyes, several Wizards and Druids raise their hands, fiery death at the ready.</p>

<p align=left>I gain a brief glance at the battlefield and even my veteran senses are appalled at the numbers of the enemy. The floor of this room is covered with a living carpet of bone and talon, mutated flesh and foul werebeasts. Our wave of warriors crashes into them and my body thrums to the music of magic as Brell’s soothing gift is bestowed to the injured. Swain, Gimmel and I, clerics all, raise our voices in a holy ecumenical chant, spurring the warriors to further heights of insane violence. Before I know it, I must fall to the ground to meditate. </p>

<p align=left>The sounds of battle crash about me. I hear our brave leaders calling out commands as our large group works in harmony. </p>

<p align=left>"Git the Hags, dunnae let em cast."</p>

<p align=left>"Burn the bitch on the left, now!"</p>

<p align=left>"Tighten up on the left, don’t let them past us!"</p>

<p align=left>"Medic, help Norton!"</p>

<p align=left>"Low on mana!"</p>

<p align=left>"Watch the greater dark bones, they’re going for the healers!"</p>

<p align=left>I brace myself for the blows, but they never come. I hear Walterus taunting and allow myself to breathe again.</p>

<p align=left>"Yer mudder was a hamster and yer fadder smelt of elderberries!"</p>

<p align=left>"Brells wrath, yer skinnier than an elf and uglier den a Gobbo"</p>

<p align=left>I stand again and survey the chaos. The battle has broken into several smaller melees. Dozens of broken bodies lie still on the ground, but thankfully not a single dwarf, human or elf among them. Xeolis in his wolf-form, foam flying from his jaws, iscircling a lone werebat who is desperately seeking escape. Calmly I identify the most greviously wounded and heal them. I sense the tide of battle change in our favour as I drop down to meditate again. </p>

<p align=left>"Runner, git im!"</p>

<p align=left>Once again I stand and heal… and watch as the last barbed bone skeleton is smashed to smithereens by the iron fists of Kwonryu. I note the absence of some heroes and realise they were forced to retreat.</p>

<p align=left>We barely have time to breathe before we are attacked from behind, several Undead Knights with their cohorts. I wonder briefly where these reinforcements have come from before I am struck several times. I stand and try to keep them from the Wizard Aillean as the warriors come to join me. We struggle under their onslaught and I can’t break away from a werebat.</p>

<p align=left>"Mana report?" Kwonryu asks.</p>

<p align=left>"Out of mana."</p>

<p align=left>"Out of mana."</p>

<p align=left>The reports show that we are weakened and exhausted by our prolonged fight. Over fifteen minutes of solid combat saps the strength of even the hardiest warriors. The call to break for the surface is given and we race away, outdistancing our enemies thanks to the spirit of the wolf who guards us.</p>

<p align=left>We reform in Dagnors Cauldron and prepare for our second assault. Once again we gather at the fountains in front of that cursed house. Once again we charge down the stairs and wade through slaughter. This time none escape to call for reinforcements and Kwonryu stops at a wall on the far side of the basement. </p>

<p align=left>His hands run over the wall briefly and Aillean gasps as he steps through the apparently solid brick wall. We follow and regroup in a narrow corridor. Everyone sports wounds that are quickly healed and soon we are ready to continue. The air becomes hot and fetid as Kwonryu warns us of a dangerous trap ahead.</p>

<p align=left>"Just walk right through the Lava, it is an illusion my sweets."</p>

<p align=left>But as we round the corner a horrendous screech is let out as two mortuary fungi leap to attack our lead warriors. The fools. Stepping over their mushroom-like corpses we stare at the bed of lava in front of us. </p>

<p align=left>A tall barbarian warrior grumbles, "I ain’t walking through that shit".</p>

<p align=left>"A fishcake to the first to follow me across," Kwonryu replies as he appears to wade through the swirling lava. </p>

<p align=left>No-one rushes, but eventually we cross. On the other side, I see Walterus with a stoney expression. He has always hated both illusions and traps. I remember his refusal to hunt in Befallen due to the many traps that infest that place and I wonder at his bravery now. </p>

<p align=left>Quietly, we sneak through more dank and odorous passages before they open up into a series of linked caverns. Strange tentacled shapes writhe in the shadows but the corpses of the slain heroes are in plain sight. They begin to loot the equipment from their corpses at the same time as we come under attack from several tentacle terrors. With a horrendous cry, a ghostly figure leaps to attack from the air itself. I let out a small moan at the sight of Garandel, a dwarvish spirit. </p>

<p align=left>"Slay the ghost!", came the cry.</p>

<p align=left>"Dammit, I cannae hurt him much, burn him!"</p>

<p align=left>"By Erollisi, my spells have no effect, he is too powerful!"</p>

<p align=left>I can see all my friend’s health dropping fast, but I am in harmony with their wounds and refuse to let death come near them. Slowly, blow by blow, spell by spell, inch by inch, the doughty heroes suck the unholy life force from the spirit. </p>

<p align=left>I murmur under my breath, "May Brell welcome you home brother," as he falls under the overwhelming attacks of my companions. I just have time to see the first of several tentacle terrors been slain before I am struck from above an knocked unconscious. When I reawaken, I realise I am alone and in great danger. A lone cry echos down the corridors, "Dearg, run my friend!"</p>

<p align=left>And so I cast invisibility on myself and advanced to the rear.</p>
