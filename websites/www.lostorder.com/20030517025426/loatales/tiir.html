<p align=left><b>Life Under The Bigtop</b><br><i>by Tiir</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Tiir dreamed. He dreamed of blood and violence, pain and torture, of death and retribution. 
He dreamed he faced the Servants of Hate once more, finally ready to take payment for the
life they stole from him so long ago. Tiir's memory was warped...life as one of the Spurned
could not possibly be as bad as he imagined it. Those Teir'dal who serve the Lord of Hate
and those who serve themselves reached a mutual agreement long ago, yet nonetheless...</p>

<p align=left>Tiir dreamed of the sweet, sweet pleasure it would be to carve out their eyes,
flay their skin, feed them to the colonies of firebeetles, slowly burning th...</p>

<p align=left>"WAKE UP LAZY INKY!"</p>

<p align=left>Tiir's pleasant thoughts were interrupted by a seven foot tall, one eyed monstrosity known 
as Kalgon. Whoever thinks the gods have no sense of humor has never seen the offspring of
an ogre and a hapless Ice Barbarian, Tiir thought. Like a caged animal, (for he more or less 
was) Tiir scrambled up and to the back of the moving cage-on-wheels Kalgon kept him in
during off times.</p>

<p align=left>Gazing darkly at Kalgon from what little cover the shadows provided, Tiir let a sinister grin slip,
but resumed his emotionless facade quickly. </p>

<p align=left>"Did Kalgon ruin inky beauty sleep? GOOD!" Kalgon said as he motioned to a nearby mercenary
to cover Tiir as he opened the door. </p>

<p align=left>Unwilling to die without first slaying his enemy, Tiir forced down the rage he felt and kept
himself still as the hideous, blubbering idiot shackled him in cold, hard, biting steel. Once assured that Tiir would not resist, Kalgon laughed and spit a phlegmy blob on Tiir's
torn and threadbare robe.</p>

<p align=left>"Ogre no wait for big star more! Inky do act now!"</p>

<p align=left>Tiir started to sigh deeply, but was cut short as he was yanked off his feet and dragged 
out of the wagon and across the barren, rocky waste land between Innothule Swamp
and the Desert of Ro. Tiir did his best to avoid the larger rocks, but little could be done
to gain a respite for his already bruised and battered body from the suffering.</p>

<p align=left>Considered a dangerous captive, and rightly so, the Circus kept their prize act separated at
a good distance from the other wagoncells. The distance proved too much physical abuse,
and Tiir felt his consciousness slipping.</p>

<p align=left>Tiir's last thought, strangely enough, was pleasure that these fools would not be able to see
the damage and weakness beneath his dark, midnight skin...</p>
