<p align=left><b>The Leavetaking</b><br><i>by Muerian</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Muerian shivered at the docks. The night was cold and bitter, like the first one he could remember. At least now he had a brandy to warm him, unlike those first years long ago. He glanced around at the other huddled shapes near him, and wondered what deeds of glory lay in their futures...</p>

<p align=left>But that was not his calling anymore. His mandolin and flute lay in his room, where trusted friends would find them. Mayhap someone more able than he would bring the song from them once more. He looked down at his hands, so unaccustomed to being idle, and wondered what lay ahead of him.</p>

<p align=left>He had left a note - somewhat cowardly of him, he knew - but he hated goodbyes. He knew his friends would remember him around the fires of their camps, wherever they were. That would be fitting, he thought, for a bard.</p>

<p align=left>"Hallooo the boat!" he heard as sailors prepared to tie the incoming ship to the docks. He held back a bit, suddenly uncertain now that his choice was before him. No - it was too late now.</p>

<p align=left>He slowly made his way up the gangplank, and settled into a place on deck where he could see the lights of Freeport fade into the distance.</p>

<p align=left>"The Ocean of Tears," he murmured... "How appropriate."</p>

<p align=left>The ship, barely at the dock long enough to take on passengers, eased out into the night.</p>
