<p align=left><b>A Voice Within Me</b><br><i>by Waran Rhinelander</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>...has been silenced. It is with great sadness that I write this missive to my bretheren in the Order. I have never opened up this much as I will here. </p>

<p align=left>I always knew deep in my heart that one day my father would no longer guide me in spirit that he has done so many times in the past. I remember all the times where he would keep me safe in fights, telling me when to attack and stand my ground. I remember seeing his sword and our family name inscribed on the Clan's blade when I learned of my heritage. Most of all, I remember the night milove and I were married, he nere said a word. He didn't have to, I could see his pride, I could see the love in his eyes and his gentle wink to me after we were wed. Oh I wish he could have held our littluns, he would have loved that.</p>

<p align=left>This trip back home has hit me the hardest, just as we arrived, an overwhelming feeling of loss swept over me. I went to the Pit of Doom to speak with my guildmaster, Kylan O'Danos. I asked about the events of the city or nearby lands. He had nothing to report. I headed home as I always do when I return from the guildmasters. I usually sit down and reflect on the recent battles. And usually, I can feel my father there, making sure I'm reviewing everything correctly. This time, nothing.....</p>

<p align=left>One thing I will always remember of my father is his kindness to many of the younger travelers that he crossed paths with in the plains. From what I've heard of stories told by other families, he was a kind and gentle man, always willing to help them out if they were overwhelmed by gobbies and gnolls as well as giving them quests to complete. </p>

<p align=left>In the spirit of me father, Koman Rhinelander, The first person to bring the head of a Gnoll or either of the two murderers found in West Karana back to Halas when I am intown, will be handsomely rewarded. They all have committed crimes against the Northlands and need to be executed promptly. In Haste brothers and sisters, carry out this death sentence. </p>

<p align=left>I will not let that voice fade away, I will continue it in me own existance. That is my vow, may Rallos Zek himself give me strength to continue in me fathers footsteps.</p>
