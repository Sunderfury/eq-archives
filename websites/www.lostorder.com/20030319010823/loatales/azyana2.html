<p align=left><b>Azyana's Journal, Entry Two</b><br><i>by Azyana</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I am sitting here in the corner at the Halas bank. I was going to put this book in there but changed my mind and decided to keep it with me on all my travels.</p>

<p align=left>I traveled here with my golden one for the wedding. Aanlain the druid had transported us all to the ring in the North Karanas. I don't know why… my age perhaps.. a bear decided to claw at me then a druid began his assault on me and then I see my golden one trying to defend me and we both are struck down. My feelings were so mixed up. I felt great joy that someone cared enough to risk his life defending me and at the same time great sadness that he lost his. Aanlain assisted in getting my golden one back to where we were and then he used that wonderful power of his to bring me back.</p>

<p align=left>Eala fell to the powers of Konek Shun and while we were waiting, Sunmoon and Aanlain decided to hunt giants. My golden one didn't want to leave my side again and instructed them to run the giant by us if they wanted healing. Of course, I know he would be off in a blink of an eye if they were truly in trouble. My mind was confused again. Only a few days earlier I had gotten some more armor from Hindolek just to look older and here he was protecting me with all that was in him, and watching over me so that I wouldn't be harmed again. </p>

<p align=left>We were on our way again and after he finished his business with Eala and Sunmoon we only had a brief moment together before he had to leave. Again my emotions confused… sad that he was leaving but excited that I'd be seeing him the next day.</p>

<p align=left>The next day came and I polished up my armor… fixed my hair and made my way back to the Glade. After the briefest greetings he was taken away so that he could prepare for his duties that evening. Then I unsuccessfully tried to help get people in the right spot so that they could hear everything. I am beginning to think people don't take me seriously because of my size. The wedding begins and we were still separated. I sat there thinking how often we are in the same place but never together. </p>

<p align=left>The wedding over my golden one came to my side and again doesn't leave. I guess he knew how I was feeling so suggested we move to some place near by that would remind me of home. He brought me to the caves behind the waterfall. Finally alone we had a chance to speak. We talked about this and that and then about marriage. I had wondered if two people who just get married always look so happy. He, in the way only he can say, said yes. He seems to have a gift for words. Then I asked him if people had to get married if they are just destined to be together and he said no but in the eyes of others it was best… or something like that… I just told him that it would be a long time before I would ever have to worry about that. Something he said is still on my mind… how some things just lead to their own conclusion. Later on I said something about how he was so knowledgeable and I am still fumbling in learning the ways of being a cleric. He, in all his kindness, offered to teach me and guide me along the path I need to follow. I told him I was worried he would be bored helping me and he assured me he wouldn't that he would hunt in the depths of the dungeons during the week and we could meet on the weekends for him to instruct me. </p>

<p align=left>So, that is where I will be traveling to now. Once I get myself in order I will begin my trip back to Freeport … to meet with my golden one.</p>
