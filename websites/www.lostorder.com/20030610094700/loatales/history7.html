<p align=left><b>A History, Part V</b><br><i>by Anonymous</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Stanic grew weary; the pain was now becoming too great to bear. He backed himself onto a level platform and collapsed against the rock. Matrick was tired as well, but rage can infuse a man with incredible stamina. He reached the level where Stanic had taken rest and drew his sword. Stanic stood, drawing his blade. Their eyes locked, each man consumed by tension for the moment. </p>

<p align=left>Matrick broke the pause, attempting to end the battle in a single blow. His swing was parried, and Stanic countered with a kick to Matrick’s midsection. </p>

<p align=left>“I have been through more than you shall ever know. Do you really believe I would fail against the likes of you?” Stanic questioned as an insidious grin consumed his face. “What is one more death to me? Your life is but a pittance in a history of dissolution.”</p>

<p align=left>“My life,” Matrick trailed off. “My life starts now.” An exchange of blows ensued. Stanic was brought to the ground in a fury and powerful downward strikes. Matrick raised his sword for a final swing, but fell backwards upon the slippery rocks, his sword sliding away from him. Stanic and Matrick rose in unison, and faced each other once more. </p>

<p align=left>Stanic grinned. He aimed for Matrick’s neck and swung with all his might. Matrick raised his left arm to absorb the assault. The blade cut deep, but Matrick felt no pain. Stanic’s eyes widened and he brought the blade back for another swing. </p>

<p align=left>Matrick lunged forth, sending Stanic falling backwards. A violent scream was soon followed by silence. Matrick, lying face down on the mountain, was once again overcome with bliss. His life would indeed begin anew.</p>

<p align=left>Stanic had fallen. His body broken and impaled upon the mountain face of Covetous.</p>

<p align=left>In death, one can sometimes find life. Stanic K’Vel had lived a vile existence, harboring nothing but contempt for every living thing. Some claimed he was a man without a soul. Others believed he was a daemon sent to bring destruction to Britannia. For ten years, he had been a plague upon humanity. Those who know not pain have no morals. Such was the case with Stanic K’Vel. </p>

<p align=left>To condemn such a man to Hell would have been too kind. He was immune to the anguish and horror of the Pit. In cases such as his, redemption is the only punishment.</p>

<p align=left>Perhaps there is no curse more vile than to be brought back to life, to live in pain and suffering. Enmity had been the trade of Stanic K’Vel. He had known no other means of existence. From birth, K’Vel was a disease upon humanity, waiting for Pandora to open her box. </p>

<p align=left>His body pieced back together and bound by Hellfire, Stanic was replaced among the living as Anger incarnate. His lot in life changed, albeit slightly. Had he a soul previously, he had none now. He was to exact vengeance upon people like himself; those guilty of his own crimes were not to live. He would see to it.</p>
