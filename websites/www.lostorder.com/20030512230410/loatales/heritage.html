<blockquote>
<p align=left>The day had come at last. For so long, this day had seemed so distant, that I had put it in the back of my mind and concentrated on other aspects of my life - my beloved wife, my guildmates, and learning as much as I could about the bardic arts. Now, however, as I ran back to my hometown of Qeynos, I almost feared the answers I was about to be granted by the person who had promised to do so upon my reaching the twentieth song.</p>

<p align=left>I remember little of my father, for he vanished or perished, no one was sure, while I was still a very young half-elf. He was human, with a visage that I remember as either tired, or haunted. Although he told me tales of the sea, and of his adventures on the waves, I could sense that there was much more to his stories than mere swashbuckling. I never even knew his name, for I called him "Father", while my mother and everyone else referred to him as only "the Admiral".</p>

<p align=left>My mother I remember well. Her name was Danae, she was a high elf cleric of moderate skill, and she loved my father very much. She was heartbroken after his departure from Qeynos, and only lived a few years after that, making sure I was raised well. Her sister, Jarna, was the one who finished raising me after that. It was Jarna who was charged by my mother to relay the truth about my origin when I came of age. She lived above a shop in Qeynos called the Tin Soldier, and my bedroom window looked down upon The Wind Spirit's Song, which is the Bardic Guild in Qeynos. I used to sit there with my flute, trying to imitate the many musicians that came and went each day. When the time came, there was no question as to which career I was going to pursue.</p>

<p align=left>Thus, as I passed the front gate of the city of Qeynos, I paused. My childhood was a happy one, but I still ached from the passage of my mother and father.</p>

<p align=left>However, the answers to all the questions I had had about their story were only a few blocks away, so I pressed on. I reached Jarna's house and knocked. After a few seconds, she opened the door and said "Yes? Who is it.."</p>

<p align=left>"Hello, Aunt Jarna," I said, smiling. "I am home."</p>

<p align=left>Her eyes grew wide as she beheld her nephew, now wearing bronze armor and carrying fine weapons. She hugged me, and we both started to weep. She pulled back, then, and said softly "Has the day come so soon?"</p>

<p align=left>"Soon ?!?" I said, astonished. " It has been many seasons since I left Qeynos in search of adventure and song."</p>

<p align=left>"Ah but it seems like just yesterday to me," she said, "that you were down there in the street pestering the Marsingers and...oh !" She stopped in mid-sentence, and I noticed she was staring at my hand. She stepped forth and held my hand, looking at the ring upon my finger.</p>

<p align=left>"You are married now?" she asked.</p>

<p align=left>"Indeed I am. I met someone very special and we were married recently. Her name is Legasi, a beautiful and brave wood elf ranger from Kelethin, and she would very much like to know what her surname is."</p>

<p align=left>Jarna's face sank from joy to dread as she sighed, and then said "Ah yes. It is time I guess you know of your father, and how he came to this land and was saved by your mother." She walked over to a locked chest and opened it slowly. She pulled a few things out, finally reaching something wrapped in cloth at the bottom. Taking the cloth over to the table, she unwrapped it, her hands trembling with either age or fear. </p>

<p align=left>On the table in front of me were two items. One, an ancient and parched book. The other was a strange scimitar which appeared in the light to shimmer like the waves on the calm sea. </p>

<p align=left>"In this book," she stated stoically "You will find the story of your father's origin. While much of it makes no sense to me, it still describes the life your father lead, and how he fell from grace."</p>

<p align=left>I picked up the scimitar and held it, feeling as though I had embraced the power of the sea itself.</p>

<p align=left>Seeing the scimitar in my hand, she said "That scimitar was his personal weapon, with which, so he had claimed, he slew a thousand water elementals. Perhaps Ton Firepride can identify its strange metal an magic for you in the morning."</p>

<p align=left>I put the sword down and looked her in the eye and asked "What was his name...what was my father's name?"</p>

<p align=left>"His name was Admiral Ruffie Windjammer." She stated flatly. </p>

<p align=left>Silence followed as the name sunk in. At last, I knew my father's name. And now, I would take it as my own. It held both musical and nautical inferences in it. I liked the way it sounded. </p>

<p align=left>That night I read Admiral Ruffie's journal. It was exhaustive, and contained many riddles. As far as I can tell, my father was a hero to a king in another land. He was a virtuous knight, called an avatar, until the day his anger was unleashed upon a dark being called Astaroth, who cast him into some kind of world that mirrored his own, but was instead overrun with chaos and anarchy. His king no longer was present, the virtues he had followed were a sad joke among the majority of the populace, and all his skills and powers were gone. He struggled for long just to survive in this world, until he too succumbed to the darkness around him. He lead a band of bloodthirsty pirates that brought blood and battle to the calm seas of that land. Eventually his evil deeds caught up with him, and he made one desperate try to break free from that world and return to his home. He sailed his mighty ship, the Kehaar, into a magical storm of his own creation, hoping to breach the barriers between worlds. Instead, his ship was torn apart by the forces he unleashed and his last memory was of the mast crashing down toward him.</p>

<p align=left>This is where he met my mother, it seems. She was on her way to Erudin to offer her healing skills in that town, when she decided to visit Kerra Isle along the way. She noticed all the native tiger-women running toward the other side of the isle, clearly startled by what they had found there. Curious, she followed them over and beheld a grim sight. A ship was wrecked there, just offshore, and my father was washed up along the beach, near death. If not for my mother's arrival, my father would have perished moments later on that beach. She saved him, took him to Qeynos to recover from his injuries, and they eventually fell in love. </p>

<p align=left>I guess that's where I come in.</p>

<p align=left>The book, as I said, contains many references and tales of unbelievable magic beyond my comprehension. One interesting chapter mentions his meeting the LOA in that land, which fits in with the few stories he told me of my guild. I shall send this book to Brigadyr of the Lost Order that it might be added to the guild's vast library of lore. </p>

<p align=left>The next morning, I departed after a hearty breakfast and a tearful farewell to my aunt. I stopped at Firepride's, and Ton Firepride was astonished upon seeing my scimitar. While he said it contained no magic greater than a combine scimitar, it was enchanted in other ways which were beyond his learning.</p>

<p align=left>I left Qeynos to begin my adult life in Norrath, now armed with my father's scimitar as well as his name. I still understand little about his life, his deeds both honorable and malevolent, but I know that wherever he is, on this day, he looks down upon his son with pride.</p>
