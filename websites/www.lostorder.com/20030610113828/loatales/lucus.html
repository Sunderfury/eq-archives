<p align=left><b>The Search Begins</b><br><i>by Lucus</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Felucca's light poured across the grounds of the Moonglow Lycaeum, giving it an 
otherworldly look, the night was almost banished it's shadows as much as the day. The 
translucent shade hiding among the trees hissed softly. Leaving the cover of the forest, it 
drifted lazily towards the ancient building, passing through the walls surrounding the 
complex. It stopped in the court yard for a moment, listening to the scribes and scholars 
go about their chronicling within. Eyes blazing, the shade slowly manifested in it's full 
glory. Resplendent in hideous midnight armor, scrolled masterfully with horrific depiction's 
and daemonic symbols stood Fustiar. Surveying the area, seeing no one present, the 
Death Knight strode purposefully towards the main scriptorium. A glint of silver pierced 
the sides of his vision, whirling out of the way, barely missing the deadly blade, he turned 
around to face the unexpected foe.</p>

<p align=left>"Who is the fool who dares challenge me?", spoke the Death Knight in a sepulchral voice, 
orbs flaring in its sockets. </p>

<p align=left>The Paladin looked into Fustiars' orbs and shouted,"Daren SilverBlade, Paladin of the 
Virtues, foul scum, prepare to meet thy doom!" Eyeing the advancing paladin with disdain, 
the Death Knight chuckled softly.</p>

<p align=left>"Very well mortal, for the glory of Entropy!" Drawing an ebony kryss, and mentally calling 
his shield, Fustiar effortlessly parried the paladins attack. Slashing with deft precision and 
speed, Fustiar left the enemies shield in pieces. Howling with desperate rage, knowing his 
skills could never measure up to his evil opponent, he knew there was only one thing to 
do, embrace death, before this horrid creature could claim his soul. A skeletal grin passed 
across the Death Knights face, as he brought his around slamming it into the paladins 
chest, crumpling his breast plate and sending him flying a dozen feet before he crashed 
into the wall, bone snapping, ribcage shattering, but still alive. </p>

<p align=left>"Get it over with devil spawn" the paladin said, spitting blood, struggling to maintain 
consciousness. Coming over, Fustiar looked down at the broken knight, contemplating. </p>

<p align=left>"My masssster, shall have use for your ssssoul, even if this wassss unexpected" it 
croaked. Withdrawing a black gem, the Death Knight placed it over the paladins chest 
and started chanting long lost words of power. Screaming in agony, the knight convulsed 
repeated, the gem pulsing with an unholy light, it drew the energy, the very life force from 
the paladin leaving nothing but an empty husk, which began decaying rapidly. Knowing 
full well, that many more mortals, who had been called by the scribes during the battle, 
were on their way, Fustiar once again faded, traveling through the nether realms back to 
the Isle of Ice. Apon arrival, it made its way to the eyesore known as Caina, hastening to 
return the to the Sepulchre of the Damned, where his master awaited.</p> 

<p align=left>"You have the information I seek, slave?", asked Lucus. </p>

<p align=left>"Nay, masster, there wass some trouble, a paladin, who interrupted my attemptssss, I did 
however claim his soul and - ", Fustiar spoke, but before finishing, his masters clawed 
hand slammed into his skull sending him careening across the room, right into a stone 
bookshelf, which shattered on his impact.</p>

<p align=left>"Stupid fool! I ask for the location of Claudia's lair and you give me a paladins soul?! Give me what I ask, or nothing at all, do not fail me again, or even you, an exalted Death 
Knight, shall feel terrible pain"</p>

<p align=left>Nodding in servitude, Fustiar faded once again to his wraith form, to find a way to 
perform the task his master required.</p>
