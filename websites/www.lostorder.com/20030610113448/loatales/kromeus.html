<p align=left><b>A Tale from the Brewman Tavern</b><br><i>by Kromeus</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>I was drunk the night the Brewman tavern was set upon by the knights of darkness. I sat, well slumped, in a roughly carved chair near the storeroom. I was in good company that night. Keeshi and Abrianus are two of the most dedicated folk a guy, or a guild, could ever hope to know. We were minding our business and talking up a storm about which of us was the most accurate with a bow. It seemed the more we drank, the more accurate we claimed to be. Keeshi held the last, and therefore winning, claim. "Why… I onsh hith a parrot that wash pershed on 'ish mashter's should...hic...should...hic...shoulder."</p>

<p align=left>"So what?" I asked.</p>

<p align=left>"Whelpers, thar we were...hic...in 'da middle of a squall like shoe never sheen. Th' parrot was about thirty leagues away!" he paused, belched, and then continued, "I jush lookit 'im an' THAWNG!" He motioned he hand trying to imitate the arrow's path. "Thaaa-WUNK! Right into the parroshe's eye."</p>

<p align=left>I arched an eyebrow at him and took another drink from my mug.</p>

<p align=left>Abrianus was holding in a chuckle and motioning for the Barkeeper to bring another mug for him.</p>

<p align=left>After Keeshi's last claim, I figured it was about time to tune him out. Besides, there was nice music to be heard that night. I was too deeply taken by the spirits I was consuming to remember who it was that was playing the music, but it was still nice. I think the song was about some kind of sea creature that was lost in a storm or something like that. Again, I don't really remember.</p>

<p align=left>The open windows allowed the warm summer breeze to trickle in and flirt with the candlelight. Shadows danced in tune to the flickering light of the candle's flame. I could hear the leaves rustle softly above the cricket's song in the forest outside. It was truly a night of serenity.</p>

<p align=left>The night was keeping a secret from me though. It had a surprise for me unlike anything I'd ever seen in this world of Sosaria. Since my days in Oearth, I'd been unimpressed by the dead that walked these lands. A zombie here, a Lich there. Nothing to fear in those things. My uneducated opinion was about to change though. My whole understanding of the undead of Sosaria was about to turn upside down and spit in my face.</p>

<p align=left>A voice that was hollow of tone but booming in presence rasped, "Death is upon ye all."</p>

<p align=left>The tavern was suddenly silent. The crickets had stopped their singing and the breeze now carried a chilly overtone. I arched my eyebrow at Abrianus and paused before shrugging my shoulders and pulling another gulp from my mug. A moment before I could finish my drink, the tavern doors shattered into the room. The force of the doors snuffed every candle in the tavern. It was pitch dark.</p>

<p align=left>My world exploded in sound as people were cursing, drawing weapons, and chanting spells. The arcane words of magic echoed in the tavern. "In Lor!", "Cor Por!", and "En Flam Grav!". Spells were being cast everywhere! After a moment, I realized that I was just sitting there. I swore, then in the darkness I began reaching for my halberd. I knew I had it leaning against the wall, but I was too damned drunk to find it!</p>

<p align=left>As I was reaching around trying to find my weapon, I was also trying to cast a simple light spell. "In Door!" I yelled. Nothing happened. "In More!" Still nothing happened. I have to remember to never get that drunk again. I continued as I was fumbling for my weapon "On Floor!" I muttered a curse when I stretched too far and fell clean off the chair. I hit the floor. Hard. Something slid away from me when I landed. At last! I found my halby!</p>

<p align=left>"Krom... It's In Lor!" shouted Keeshi. How the hell did he sober up so fast?</p>

<p align=left>"I know! I know!" I shouted back at him.</p>

<p align=left>I heard tables shattering and swords clanging. I had to get into the fight and help my brethren fast! I took a deep breath.</p>

<p align=left>"I'M SORE!" I chanted.</p>

<p align=left>"IN Lor!" Keeshi repeated.</p>

<p align=left>"Right!" I said. "IN LOR!"</p>

<p align=left>Suddenly, the tavern was bathed in sunlight. At least it was to me. I ignored my sudden hangover and looked about to see what was going on. Keeshi was fighting two evil looking critters. Maraxus was having the time of his life bashing the sense out of another one. Abrianus was busy aiming his bow at what looked like a zombie, but it seemed too quick to be one. Brimstone was against a corner wielding the biggest mace I'd ever seen. I'm not sure, but I swear I heard him trying to talk peace to the creatures he was fighting! Hell, if anyone could, It'd be him.</p>

<p align=left>I saw a slight movement out of the corner of my eye. I looked out the window and saw Ni`Vek, Tara, Gwen, Gres, Etain, and Joxer fighting the same foul beasts. I was slowly becoming impressed by the way these creatures presented their attack. Before that moment, I'd never seen undead mount a coordinated attack!</p>

<p align=left>My head was clearing and my heart was pounding. I had to get into the fight now! The closest beast had its back to me and was getting ready to swing a thick club at Abrianus. I moved to engage it and tripped on a fallen chair. My actions were not all for nothing though. The beast left Abrianus alone to come after me!</p>

<p align=left>I didn't have the time to stand, so I crouched. I was very unsure of melee ability because not only was I as drunk as a bum in Buck's Den, I also really had to relieve myself. I'd been drinking for hours without a break and it was not helping my situation. When the fiend was close enough, I pounced upward with my halby aimed for its midsection. My foot was propped against the wall for leverage, so I had a good upward force. The halby hit true and I could feel it in the shaft of my halberd when the spear-like tip pierced what little flesh it had.</p>

<p align=left>Unaffected by the gaping wound I left in it when I pulled my weapon out, the beast brought its club against my shoulder with an unimaginable force. I was flung across the room to where Maraxus was fighting. "Hail Krom!" he said with enthusiasm. I shook my head to clear it. I was even more impressed now. The creatures were as strong as any of us! Not as skilled perhaps, but their sheer numbers and their individual strength was formidable indeed.</p>

<p align=left>"Right!" I said to myself as I stood up. I took my helmet from my shoulder strap and secured it on my head. I was always trying to avoid wearing the thing. It was just plain ugly! Anyway, I saw that Maraxus was doing fine, as was Keeshi. Brimstone did not need any help and Abrianus was a little nervous, but not in any trouble. Then I saw that the door was not being guarded. They had open access to the tavern!</p>

<p align=left>I bolted across the room and tripped again. This time I didn't notice what I tripped on. I stumbled the rest of the way to the devastated doorway. The stench of rotting flesh assaulted my senses. It was an unforgettable musk-laden stench that was sweet and pungent. It sobered me right up. I assessed the situation in the clearing and found that most of the attackers were defeated. Most of them were beheaded! Pretty gruesome, but I thought nothing more of it.</p>

<p align=left>Just as I began to relax, my heart skipped a beat when I saw two hooded figures standing under the Tree of Wisdom. They were chanting and glowing with a soft, red aura. "The Tree!" I shouted as loud as I could, then regretted it. My helmet resonated with the sound of my voice and my hangover doubled in intensity.</p>

<p align=left>My warning got through though. The figures looked up and stopped chanting. They were looking straight at me. I could see flames within their hollow skulls. Blue flames that looked as though they would never stop burning. I've seen them before! I knew who they were! I swore as I flung myself towards them. I had a good twenty pace run to get at them, but I was determined.</p>

<p align=left>One of the hooded figures gestured at me. I braced myself when I saw the air in front of me ripple with energy. The wave of energy hit me full in the chest, but I managed to resist most of its affects. I was almost within striking distance and I raised my halby for a bone shattering strike.</p>

<p align=left>Suddenly, my foot stopped. My leg was caught and being held by a skeletal hand that was reaching out from the ground! My forward momentum slammed me into the ground and knocked the wind right out of me. I pulled on the hand and felt it give way as the wrist snapped.</p>

<p align=left>I saw my chance to strike so I twirled around with the halberd in tow, following my movements with great force. I swung the blade of my silver halby through one of the figure's necks. After all, how else does one kill an immortal warlord?</p>

<p align=left>The figure collapsed and it's bones made a hollow clattering sound as they piled upon the ground. I looked to the other figure. It was staring at its fallen companion. Before I could swing at it, it raised a bony hand and my weapon's shaft crumbled to splinters. I balled my fists and was in mid swing before the blade of my beloved halby hit the ground. My fist connected with the figure's jaw and broke it with a loud 'snap'. The fiend spun slightly before it could counter my attack.</p>

<p align=left>Invisible hands grabbed me and forcefully thrashed me into the Tree of Wisdom. I was shaken, but not seriously injured. As I was being held against the tree, I realized that I could use it for leverage. I brought my leg up and kicked the figure dead in the chest. It stumbled back and I was instantly released and fell to the ground.</p>

<p align=left>I was just about ready to collapse, for now I was feeling the combined affects of the night's events. I saw the hooded figure approaching me out of the corner of my eye. It was out for the kill. I tried to stand but was too dizzy. Trying hard to clear my mind, I chanted. "In Vas Mani!" The air shimmered around me and my wounds tingled for a moment.</p>

<p align=left>My wounds felt better, but the figure was now close enough to attack. My healing spell had cost me precious time and I was out of tricks!</p>

<p align=left>"Corp Por!" chanted a familiar voice. The air shimmered as a powerful wave of energy rippled towards my attacker.</p>

<p align=left>The hooded fiend turned in time to catch the energy bolt full in the face. It struck with such force that it was picked up and flung back towards Joxer's old place. Tad, Joxer's hireling, jumped back with a start as the figure landed near him.</p>

<p align=left>I looked up and into the helm of Lochedahnan. "Thanks old friend!" I said. He nodded and tossed me a sword.</p>

<p align=left>I caught it by the hilt and nodded my thanks. It was time to rescue Tad! When I finally made it to my feet, I turned and started to run towards Tad's usual location. The figure was gone!</p>

<p align=left>I shrugged and headed off into the forest a bit. The first thing I did was look for the hooded figure. The next thing I did was relieve myself. I'd been holding that in far too long! I looked back towards the village clearing and saw bright flashes and flame, but I could tell that the real threat was over.</p>

<p align=left>Finally relieved, I secured Loch's sword in my belt, and headed back to the clearing to help my brethren clean up the chaos. After all, that's what we do... that's what we are all about.</p>
