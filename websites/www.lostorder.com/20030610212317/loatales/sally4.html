<p align=left>Jared my love,</p>

<p align=left>I just wanted to let you know that I am doing me best at becoming a real lady for ye. It has not been easy this past week…I am not complaining but I am not fond of cooking. </p>

<p align=left>*pouts*</p>

<p align=left>I did exactly what Officer Noc said and went over to the Brewman Tavern to speak with Sir Attrael about learning how to cook. When I got there the place was full of customers and poor Attrael was so busy. I ask him if he could teach me how to become a chef like him and that Officer Noc had sent me. He looked at me and his eyes grew wide and his face got very pale…just like the Widow Harris and Officer Noc…someone should really do something about this sickness that is going around…I mean I really do not want to get ill as well.</p>

<p align=left>Attrael quickly ran and got himself a drink of water and muttered something about the Fleet and Officer Noc…. I could not hear exactly what he said something about banning the whole lot of them from the Brewman because of this. After a few moments, Attrael smiled at me and said “Sally I would be honored to have you as my student; however as you can see I am so overworked that I am afraid that I can not send the proper amount of time to teach you. I will however give you a name of a Baker who trained me that might be able to take you on as his student.” Attrael smiled and gave me the name of Thomas O’Hara and directions to his bakery in Yew. I smiled back at Attrael and thanked him. Attrael said as I was leaving the Brewman, “Sally, once you have master the art of baking …please come back here and I will give ye a job.” With that bit of good news, I ran straight to Thomas O’Hara’s bakery.</p>

<p align=left>I arrived at the bakery about 3:00 in the afternoon and everything was quiet. I walked up to Thomas O’Hara and introduced my self and told him that Attrael had sent me. I believe that Mr. O’Hara is ill as well…his face got real pale and eyes grew wide and then his faces started getting redder and redder. His lips began to shake as he asked me to please repeat ..who sent me here and for what purpose. I think this illness was effecting his hearing a bit so I yelled. “ATTRAEL FROM THE BREWMAN SENT ME TO YOUR SHOP SO THAT YOU CAN TEACH ME HOW TO BECOME A BAKER.” About that time Mrs. O’Hara came running out of the kitchen…she had a broom in her hand and was swinging it towards me saying some words that I have only heard sailors and me sister Daisy say. So I left the store, and I had just barely gotten out when the door slammed shut and was locked from inside. The next thing that happened was that Mrs. O’Hara was using the broom on Mr. O’Hara and telling him that if she ever sees him in the company of….well I won’t repeat the name …again she was going to leave him.</p>

<p align=left>I went back to the Brewman’s tavern and told Sir Attrael what had happened and started to cry. Attrael then sighed and said, “Well Sally, since you are trying so hard to follow the path of the light…I must as a member of the Lost Order assist you in your time of need. I will teach you all that I know about being a BattleChef, but let’s start next week after the Holidays.” I stopped crying and smiled at Attrael. “Thank ye …oh thank ye kind sir…I will do my very best and I will not let you down”, I said to Attrael.</p>

<p align=left>So you see Jared, I thought all was lost and about to go back to me old ways, but your friends in the LOA won’t let me failed they want me to become a real lady for ye.</p>
