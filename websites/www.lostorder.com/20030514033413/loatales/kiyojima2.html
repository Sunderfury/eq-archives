<p align=left><b>Zaikhal Outing</b><br><i>by Kiyo-Jima</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left>Kiyo-Jima bows to Taishi Kirin and says, "Greetings my friend. I came as soon as I received your missive. I apologize for the delay but I was in the South Dires and the trip to Zaikhal was arduous."</p>

<p align=left>Taishi Kirin bows and says, "I understand and am glad you could come."</p>

<p align=left>"I live to serve my friend. When one calls, I come. Have you found any word of the assassin's daughter?"</p>

<p align=left>"I have heard a rumor that she is friends with the ivory crafter here in Zaikhal but I am afraid that is not why I asked you here."</p>

<p align=left>Kiyo interest peeks but he only says, "Let us put some small distance between us and the town then, there are ears everywhere these days."</p>

<p align=left>"That would be wise my friend and besides there is something I would show you."</p>

<p align=left>Taishi leads Kiyo through the forest until a temple comes into view and then sits with his back to a tree, eyeing the temple. Following his lead, Kiyo sits on the ground after first ensuring that his katar is close to hand. Kiyo then glances at Taishi in inquiry.</p>

<p align=left>Considering his words carefully, Taishi begins, "I have made some friends here while searching for rumors of the assassin's daughter. The knowledge I have gained is not good. Zaikhal it would seem, is plagued by trouble."</p>

<p align=left>Though he listens intently, Kiyo continues to watch the temple, for he senses evil within those walls. He glances at the surrounding countryside and then motions for Taishi to continue.</p>

<p align=left>"Banderling breeders have moved into a long vacant fort in the hills to the northwest. The banderling population is now out of control and some of the townsfolk have gone missing. I went into the hills and scouted the area. The fort is full of young banderlings, hordes of guards, some captains, and it would seem some undead also, from the sounds emanating from the place. There numbers are now more than the fort can hold and so they have begun spreading out and thus, have come into conflict with the town."</p>

<p align=left>Kiyo nods and looks at Taishi "and?"</p>

<p align=left>Grinning Taishi says, "I knew you would not think banderlings alone would have me summon you."</p>

<p align=left>"The temple you watch has become tainted and this source of evil also afflicts the town. The danger is not as obvious and perhaps not as urgent, but it is just as real."</p>

<p align=left>Smiling Kiyo says, "Did you scout it? What did you find?"</p>

<p align=left>"Alas, I could not. The evil is so strong that I could get no further than the outer walls. I fear it will take those more experienced in such things than I to enter those foul halls."</p>

<p align=left>Sighing Kiyo nods, "You were wise to summon me to this place. I will send out the word. I will ask those of the Order who can assemble quickly to meet in Cragstone and accompany us here. From what you have said, the banderlings are the more urgent threat to the town and so, we shall deal with them first. Then, if a large enough force of seasoned veterans arrive, we shall try to cleanse this temple."</p>

<p align=left>"While I send out the word, I would like you to continue your search for the assassin's daughter."</p>

<p align=left>Taishi nods acceptance and then the two stand and turn back towards the town.</p>
