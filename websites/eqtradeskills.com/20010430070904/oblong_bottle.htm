<p align="center"><font size="4">This is part of the quest that people dread
from what I have heard.&nbsp; I have 3 shots of this part of the quest that will
hopefully help you out a bit.&nbsp; After the Sister Island, you will travel on
the boat for a bit.&nbsp; You will pass between to stone cliffs, aqua goblins
and sirens usually inhabit these.&nbsp; I jumped off the ship to the one on the
left side of the boat and climbed up onto the rock.&nbsp; Head to the front of
the rock (toward the direction the ship was going).&nbsp; There is a small ledge
I got my bearings on before I took a leap of faith into the icy waters.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bottle1.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">This is me looking to my right from the
ledge.&nbsp; I am going to throw up the next pic I took after I already got the
bottle and swam straight up from the ocean bottom.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/bottle3.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4">This is looking straight back from where I swam
from.&nbsp; Now when you are heading out from the rocks, you will see the rocky
surface under the water.&nbsp; The rocks taper off into sand and drops down a
bit more.&nbsp; This is when you know you are getting close.&nbsp; The EXACT
location of the bottle is -1611, 2924 and it appears as a bag on the ocean
floor.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">As you can see from the pic, </font><font size="4">my
stamina didn't go down a whole lot, and this was my first attempt looking for it
so you have a bit of time to hunt for it.&nbsp; The water isn't REALLY deep but
keep an eye on your meter if you don't have a fishbone earring or
water-breathing equipment.&nbsp; I have a swimming skill of 125 I think so the
swim was not too bad, lower level swimmers will obvious have less underwater
time and stamina so it may be close for some of you.&nbsp; Anyway here is the
final result of the quest for the oblong bottle:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4">Hope this helps and makes this a little less
stressful for some of you.&nbsp; It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but
If I had seen something like this before, it would have made it a lot easier so
I have decided to add it to help you on your journey. (In case you are wondering
I bought extra brews for my guild so they wouldn't have to run all over to get
them *grin*</font></p>
