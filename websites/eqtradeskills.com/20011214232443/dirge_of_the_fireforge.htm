<font color="#FFFF00">Near a defiant forge stood three,<br>
Master smiths of great pedigree.<br>
Engaged in a test of mettle and might,<br>
they piled their craft till dead of night.<br>
Their hammers rang, and sparks did fly,<br>
till one grinned widely, his expression wry.<br>
<br>
His skillful hand bore what was built,<br>
from Honest Drink, and Mold of Hilt.<br>
A Metal Sheet, and Spiked Ball Mold,<br>
A Forged Morning Star to behold!<br>
<br>
<br>
At the blazing forge stood two,<br>
with bellows feeding flames of blue.<br>
From within the heated air did rise,<br>
the second blacksmith's joyous cries.<br>
<br>
<br>
A Water Flask and Metal Sheet,<br>
a Pommel Mold, and Hilt Mold meet.<br>
Add a Mold for Heavy Steel Blades,<br>
and a Forged Two Handed Sword is made.<br>
<br>
<br>
Near the waning flame stood one,<br>
with morning rise, his work near done.<br>
As the coals turned faded gray,<br>
his forged creation saw light of day.<br>
<br>
<br>
His skill did show in completed task,<br>
Mold of Pommel, Hilt, and a Water Flask.<br>
A Mold for a strong Dual-Edged Blade,<br>
make a Forged Bastard Sword suited for any raid.</font><br>
