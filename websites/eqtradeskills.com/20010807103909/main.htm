<font size="5" color="#00FF00">April 25, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Things
are finally starting to come together =)&nbsp; I have the site updated a bit and
have just a few more things to add.&nbsp; The compendium has been updated as
well, I still need to convert it into .pdf format but the excel version is
updated so feel free to grab it =)&nbsp; I hope to have the other one done by
the weekend.&nbsp; Added a few brewing recipes and a lot of baking stuff.&nbsp;
I also added the foraging section and Hope to have the Cultural Smithing up to
date as well.&nbsp; This has definitely been a bakers week so you guys enjoy the
limelight for a bit!&nbsp; Have fun out there and keep the updates rolling in!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">April 19, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Still
getting everything in order here!&nbsp; I got most of the pages fixed now and
the links are opening their own window like they are supposed to!&nbsp; I am
working on updating the compendium and I have been getting a lot of requests for
the Wood-Elf and Halfling cultural smithing sections.&nbsp; I know the links on
the tailoring page are broken and I am working on rebuilding the cultural
section of the site.&nbsp; I hope to have it done very soon.&nbsp; If you need
those recipes, you can find them in the compendium along with everything else
you can imagine =)&nbsp; Hope to get some free time this week, I'll keep you
guys updated either way!&nbsp; Thanks again for all the great email and you guys
have fun out there! (Especially you Bakers!&nbsp; *grin*&nbsp; )</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">April 18, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Just
wanted to let you all know I have been getting your email.&nbsp; I am still in
the process of restoring everything on the site.&nbsp; The patch yesterday made
a lot of changes to the baking trade skill and I 'll be posting info as it rolls
in!&nbsp; Sorry for the downtime, been a busy few weeks at work and I will get
some time soon I hope!&nbsp; Hope you all are having a great week and I'll see
you soon!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">April 10, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Things
are starting to get back to normal finally.&nbsp; My email is still down so I
may have to go with another hosting service.&nbsp; There are quite a few updates
that I still have to add here.&nbsp; An exciting note for all you bakers out
there, Some of your baked goods will now have bonuses on them!&nbsp; I don't
have a lot of details yet but I will be added them as I find out!&nbsp; I have
heard they are on the test server now and a few are even on the live
servers!&nbsp; I hope to have the compendium updated this week and have the
pages on the site updated as well.&nbsp; Stay safe and I'll talk to you soon!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">April 7, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well,
this had been really nice!&nbsp; My hosting company decided to move all their
accounts to another server.&nbsp; They didn't bother to copy the existing
website over to the new server though!&nbsp; My email address is hosed and I
just now got everything back in order!&nbsp; Sorry for the downtime and I am
working on getting all the updates added today as well!&nbsp; The email address
you can reach me at is here:</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4"><a href="mailto:oke@mediaone.net">oke@mediaone.net</a></font>

<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 29, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well,
here is what I love about Verant! (J/K by the way)&nbsp; After having all of
these recipes in for Velious tailoring for almost a half year, they go ahead and
change it!&nbsp; At first report all of the Velious recipes were broken after
the patch.&nbsp; Then come to find out that Verant changed them all from being
made in a sewing kit to being combined in a </font><font size="4" color="#00FFFF">Coldain
Tanning Kit. They can be purchased in Thurgadin.&nbsp; </font><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">I
had just got the compendium right were I liked it and now I have to change it
again&nbsp; ACK!! Anyway, please feel free to let Verant know what a great job
they are doing with trade skills!&nbsp; *grin*&nbsp; I hope not too many of you
lost a lot of those expensive materials over the last 2 days!&nbsp; I will have
the compendium updated asap!&nbsp; Stay safe out there ladies and gents and I
hope to have some better news for you next time!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 27, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Got
a chance to work on a few things after the weekend.&nbsp; The compendium now has
a table of contents with hyperlinks so it will be a lot easier to navigate
through it.&nbsp; Still getting a lot of great email from you all.&nbsp; Just to
let you know the Erudite recipes are not working yet in the game.&nbsp; Just
like the Cobalt Cod, well the silk is also not dropping yet and will be coming
soon in an upcoming patch.&nbsp; No news on Troll Armor yet either.&nbsp; I have
heard that the Erudite Sewing Kits can be purchased now off vendors so grab them
while you can!!&nbsp; They may make them player made kits in the patch as
well.&nbsp; I'll get more info up here for you guys as soon as I get it!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 23, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">WOW!&nbsp;
Got up this morning and checked my email and got quite a few we want the excel
back!&nbsp; Well I am putting it back up but here is the catch.&nbsp; The
document is protected now so you can't change or modify it.&nbsp; I know some of
you don't have Adobe Acrobat so that is the main reason I am putting that back
up.&nbsp; Most of the pages from the compendium are now available in HTML format
as well on the site.&nbsp; I modified the brewing, tailoring, baking, poisons,
and pottery pages with the new format for the recipes.&nbsp; I will be gone all
weekend so I will try to get reply's to you all as soon as I get back!&nbsp;
Thanks again for all the comments and let me know what else I can do.&nbsp; Have
a great weekend!&nbsp;</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 22, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well
I finally got the Adobe Acrobat version completed!!&nbsp; Some of the pages are
a bit off so I will have to tweak it a bit.&nbsp; The new format is easy to read
and has a table of contents so you can click on one of the headings and it will
pop you right to that section.&nbsp; I still have a few to add so all the links
won't work right now.&nbsp; Updated quite a few things in there so check the new
version for some added poison, baking, smithing, and Erudite cultural additions
and changes.&nbsp; I have taken down the Excel Spreadsheet version of the
compendium.....There are already rogue versions of it running around out there
and with all the work I have put into this, I hate seeing it being distributed
with someone else's website and name on it.&nbsp; Hope this doesn't cause you
too many snags!&nbsp; I have included a link to the Adobe Acrobat site that you
can download for free.&nbsp; Hope you like some of the new changes and thanks
again for all the great email you guys!&nbsp; I am going to be out of town this
weekend so I am going to get all the updates in tomorrow!&nbsp; Have fun out
there and stay safe!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 21, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Found
out that I have like 35 blank pages in the compedium!&nbsp; OOPS!!&nbsp; I fixed
that so it will print properly now.&nbsp; I updated the poisons section and am
getting all the info for the new Erudite Cultural Armor to add as well!&nbsp;
Hope you guys are all having fun out there and finding all the new recipes that
went in with the new patch!&nbsp; For you bakers out there, I am adding a new
section to the compendium.&nbsp; It appears that different types of eggs make
more clumps of dough than others!&nbsp; Anywhere from 1 to 12 clumps of dough
can be made from different eggs!&nbsp; I'll get that added as soon as I get
everything for that!&nbsp; Anyway, Hope to have some new goodies for ya this
week!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 15, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">I
never thought this day would come but I actually got the compendium
FINISHED!!!&nbsp; The complete version is now available so knock yourselves
out!&nbsp; I see in the patch message that there are a lot of trade skill
additions so there will be another update soon!&nbsp; Just to let you tailors
know, Cod has finally been put in the game!&nbsp; You can fish for them in
Cobalt Scar&nbsp; =)&nbsp; To make the cod oil, all you have to do is flip one
in a brew barrel with a flask of water and you are good to go!&nbsp; I need to
say thanks to everyone who sent in info to make this compendium as complete as
possible.&nbsp; Also, a special thanks to Joel Merrill at <a href="http://www.1k.com">www.1k.com</a>!&nbsp;
I am getting ready to add a trade skill searchable database and Joel will be
giving me a hand with it.&nbsp; I will get to the email this weekend so look for
some replies soon!&nbsp; Thanks again to everyone who submitted info and keep up
the great work!&nbsp; The Adobe version will be done shortly and will be much
easier to use than the Excel spreadsheet.</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 13, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Added
a few more sections to the cultural smithing section!&nbsp; I have the Halfling
and both Freeport and Qeynos Human sections added.&nbsp; I hope to have the rest
done tomorrow.&nbsp; Been a long day and I need to hit the hay.&nbsp; See you
guys tomorrow!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 12, 2001</font><p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Okay!&nbsp;
Have updated the compendium quite a bit today!&nbsp; I added a new ore section
to the smithing part of the compendium and got the Dark Elf, Dwarven, and High
Elf cultural armor sections added!&nbsp; Just a few more to go and I'll have
that section complete!&nbsp; Also a few new Velious Tailoring recipes were added
as well.&nbsp; I am still getting a lot of great email from you guys!&nbsp; Keep
those rolling in because it is giving me a lot more to add to the site!&nbsp;
Hope you all are well and I'll hopefully have this thing finished
tomorrow.&nbsp; Stay safe and see you soon.</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 11, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Been
a busy few weeks!&nbsp; I just finished designing a few websites and building a
few PC's for friends at work!&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping to get the compendium
finally finished and up to date!&nbsp; I have been getting a lot of great emails
from you guys and I will reply to you as soon as I get some time here!&nbsp;
Hope you are all doing well and thanks again for all your feedback!&nbsp; Stay
safe out there!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">March 3, 2001</font><p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well
it had been a busy month!&nbsp; I am still trying to get the compendium finished
and get the site up to date!&nbsp; I'll have more for you guys tomorrow!&nbsp;
Sorry for the lack of updates!&nbsp; RL has been pretty crazy so I hope to have
new info for you tomorrow!&nbsp; Stay safe out there =)</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">February 19, 2001</font>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Got the blacksmithing section
done in the compendium!&nbsp; I still have to add all the cultural armor recipes
and a few notes to a few pages but it should be complete very soon!&nbsp; I
don't know how many people actually know about it yet.&nbsp; I haven't got a lot
of feedback yet so I am assuming you all like it so far.&nbsp; Stay safe out
there and talk to you all soon!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">February 18, 2001</font>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Okay, got a little game time in
today and had quite a day!&nbsp; Finally bought my Dwarven Workboots and my
Slime Coated Harpoon!&nbsp; Talk about some HUGE backstabs now!&nbsp; I also got
to hang out with some really cool folks today!&nbsp; I'll be adding some pics
this week in the pictures section so check em out if you have a chance.&nbsp; I
updated the Compendium a bit more today.&nbsp; Baking has been added and I only
have the smithing sections to go!&nbsp; Hope to have those done tomorrow.&nbsp;
The cultural armor section will follow soon after!&nbsp; Should have some time
to work on it this week so I'll keep you updated with the progress!&nbsp; Stay
safe out there and talk to you soon!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">February 17, 2001</font>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Hey all!&nbsp; Hope you guys
are having a great weekend!&nbsp; I am going to be doing some work today on the
compendium and making some adjustments to the site!&nbsp; It is a lot easier for
me to modify the spreadsheet and put it into the site instead of adding it line
by line.&nbsp; I hope the guide has been a bit useful for you.&nbsp; I have not
heard a lot back yet from folks and could really use your input before I publish
the full version of it in the next few days!&nbsp; Anything you guys want to
share. Likes, dislikes, things you want to see in the compendium.&nbsp; You name
it!&nbsp; It doesn't have to be all recipes.&nbsp; Let me know and I hope to
have some updates out there for you.&nbsp; If you are looking for the new info,
I have been adding it to the compendium and not the pages yet!!&nbsp; I'll get
back to the site when this project is done!&nbsp; Thank you for your patience
and hope to see you out there soon!&nbsp; The poison section I have recently
added for my rogue brethren is the most complete one I have seen anywhere on the
web so please take a look at it!&nbsp; One more quick change, I have received a
lot of complaints about the background being hard to read with the text.&nbsp;
Hope the new one is a bit easier on the eyes!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">February 14, 2001</font>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Happy Valentines Day you
all!!&nbsp; I got on early this morning because I couldn't sleep and I know I
won't have time until Saturday to get back on here!&nbsp; I am planning on doing
the compendium in .PDF format as well when it is complete so you can chose which
you like better.&nbsp; The Adobe documents always seem to look a little nicer
for some reason!&nbsp; Anyway, you guys have a great day with your honey's or
whoever and have a good couple of days!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">February 13, 2001</font>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Got a few more pages added to
the compendium.&nbsp; Tailoring and Pottery have been added!&nbsp; I know you
are all looking forward to the Smithing section but that is going to take a few
days....it is going to be a HUGE section.&nbsp; I hope to get everything else
added tomorrow and smithing and cultural armor by the weekend.&nbsp; I have been
getting a lot of good feedback yet so I hope you get some use out of this!&nbsp;
Stay safe out there and see you tomorrow!</font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">February 12, 2001</font>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Okay, well I am feeling pretty
bad here because I have had almost NO time to work on and maintain this
site!&nbsp; I am trying to get something together to at least keep you guys
updated so here is what I have come up with!&nbsp; I can't do any work on the
site from work but I can work on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet!&nbsp; So I am
starting a new trade skill compendium to keep you guys up to date!&nbsp; I still
plan on updating the site when I can but when it goes 3 or 4 weeks with no
updates, I feel bad and get upset that I can't even find a few hours in the week
to work on the site!&nbsp; So here is the beta version for you to check
out!&nbsp; Please give me as much feedback as possible so I can tailor this to
your needs.&nbsp; It is very printer friendly so I think you will like it.&nbsp;
I have the Brewing and Fishing sections done so far, I plan on getting a few
done a day so time willing, I'll have the official first release by the
weekend!&nbsp; Hope you like it and please, let me know what you guys can use on
it.&nbsp; Talk to you all soon!</font><p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00"><a href="eqtradeskills.exe" target="_blank">check
out the new compendium here!</a></font>

<p align="center">


<font size="5" color="#00FF00">February 5, 2001</font>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Okay, well I got a small update
in tonight!&nbsp; Here is the new <a href="velious_trade_skills.htm">Velium
smithing and tailoring section!</a></font>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">I am still working on a
complete trade skill guide for you all to download instead of trying to print
stuff off the site!&nbsp; I am doing it in Excel spreadsheet format and also
Adobe Reader format.&nbsp; I hope to have that done soon!&nbsp; I think the
spreadsheet will be easier to maintain than the site so I want it to be
available to you guys as soon as possible.&nbsp; I'll start posting the rough
drafts up here when it gets a little more meat to it.&nbsp; Have fun all and see
you soon!</font>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well, this kind of
stinks!&nbsp; All the mods I made to the website while I was on vacation seems
to be LOST!&nbsp; I went to copy all the pages over from my laptop and there was
some problem with the files!&nbsp; I apologize about the lack of updates and I
am going to try and get as much in as I can this week.&nbsp; Seems like such a
waste and I wish I had the changes here for you all.&nbsp; I promise it will be
worth the wait though!&nbsp; There are many new recipes coming in daily so it
should be bigger and better than ever.&nbsp; Thank you for you patience!</font>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Hi all!!&nbsp; I was in Shanty
Creek all weekend so I wasn't able to get any updates on here =(&nbsp;&nbsp;
Good news is that I got my laptop from work on Thursday and was able to get A
TON of updates added while I was out of town!&nbsp; I'll transfer them over here
tonight, polish them up a bit then add em!&nbsp; Just have to say you guys have
been sending me some GREAT info!&nbsp; Thank you all for all your hard work and
check back this evening for some huge updates!</font>
</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">January 15, 2001</font>

</p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well, if you couldn't tell this
has been a CRAZY year already!!&nbsp; Can't believe this is the first update I
have been able to get in here since the new year!&nbsp; I have a lot of
corrections to make, been getting a lot of great email from you guys and girls
and I have to say thanks for keeping this place as accurate as possible!!&nbsp;
I don't have the time to check EVERY recipe so there will be errors and I really
appreciate you guys finding them and sending the right one in to me!&nbsp;
Haven't been able to spend much time in Velious. Was there for a little bit
around Christmas but didn't get too far into it.&nbsp; I know there are a TON of
new things out there, just have to find them and figure out what makes what and
what goes where&nbsp; =)&nbsp; Rogues will be happy that there are MANY new
poison recipes coming!&nbsp; Hope you guys all had a safe and happy New Year and
I hope there are no more lapses like this past one!&nbsp; Stay safe out there
and see you soon!</font>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">December 23, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Getting the new pages setup
here!&nbsp; I apologize for the lack of updates, busy as all heck here with
Christmas and the new job!&nbsp; I am getting the cultural smithing pages in
order, taking a lot longer than I thought!&nbsp; I have the barbarian cultural
page done but have the rest to go.&nbsp; Hope to get a few more completed
today.&nbsp; Check the Barbarian section and let me know if that is a little
more helpful and if there is an easier format to read.&nbsp; I hope to get a few
more done tonight after I have Christmas with the outlaws (in-laws *grin*)&nbsp;
Hope you all are having a good time out there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Finally have some free time to
work on the site!&nbsp; The production went really well last weekend. We have
been tearing down all the sets and some of the decorations all week.&nbsp; My
MCSE test went great, passed my workstation and have my server this Wednesday so
I am studying for that.&nbsp; Need a little break from all this studying and
there are a TON of updates that need to be added.&nbsp; Halflings can make their
cultural armor now!&nbsp; Unfortunately Wood Elves are still stuck with no armor
until they get their recipes fixed!&nbsp; I am going to redo the cultural armor
section because that page is just too huge and with the updates and changes,
they will be easier to track.&nbsp; I did get my copy of Velious in but haven't
found the time to even get over there to take a look at it yet!&nbsp; I hope to
get some time in this weekend!&nbsp; Hope you all are having fun out there and
there will be some brewing, tailoring, and smithing updates added to the site
today!&nbsp; I have been getting a lot of email corrections so thank you all for
submitting the info!&nbsp; Stay safe out there and have fun!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#00FF00">December 3, 2000</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Can you believe that December
is already here!!&nbsp; I have so many things going on right now that I have had
zero time to work on the site.&nbsp; I have a lot of plans, just need to find
the time to do it.&nbsp; I start my new job on Monday, I have my production
going on next weekend and I have my workstation and server exam coming up on the
13th.&nbsp; Needless to say, the site will get very little attention over the
next couple of weeks.&nbsp; If there are any earth shattering discoveries found
then I will of course make time to get you all informed and with the release of
the new expansion, looks like I may be doing just that!&nbsp; Anyway, Sorry for
the lack of updates.&nbsp; I'll make it up to you guys I promise when things
aren't this crazy around here.&nbsp; Stay safe out there!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well on to the good
stuff!&nbsp; Hope you find some very useful information in here, I have a lot of
different info from other sites and tried to combine it all into one.&nbsp; Good
