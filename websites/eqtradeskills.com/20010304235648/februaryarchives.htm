<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/29/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Updates coming this afternoon!!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/28/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Whew!!&nbsp; Had a great
weekend.&nbsp; Dusted off Raul and had a GREAT time in Cazic-Thule.&nbsp; It
makes SUCH a difference when you get with a great group.&nbsp; We had 2 rogues
playing ping-pong and I will never again whine about how crappy rogues are right
now.&nbsp; We did A LOT of damage and were the tanks of the group.&nbsp; The new
evade skill works great and I applaud Verant for making the additions that they
did.&nbsp; Finally got off hell level and picked up some nice equipment in the
process and even made some money.&nbsp; I think I will be playing him a lot more
now and look forward to the rest of the improvements they are making to the
rogue class.&nbsp; I should have the weapons guide done today in the
blacksmithing area and adding a few things here and there.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/25/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Okay, trying to get as much of
the smithing page done that I can before the weekend!&nbsp; The basic smithing
guide is done and banded should be there shortly!&nbsp; If I don't talk to you
again today, have a GREAT weekend and good luck out there!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/24/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Ugh, sorry no updates today --
real life stuff&nbsp; =(</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/23/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well I was able to update a few
of the maps today, Clan Runnyeye, Tox Forest, Erud's Crossing, and the Temple of
Solusek Ro.&nbsp; The graphics for the rest of the blacksmithing page are still
needing some work and I have a few more links to add as well.&nbsp; Hope you all
are doing well and hope to have more goodies for you soon!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/22/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Well it is finally starting to
fall into place, I have part of the smithing page up, the links page, and class
specific links up and running.&nbsp; I have a lot of graphics to mess with on
the banded armor and forged weapons guide so I will get those added over the
course of this week.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/21/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Blacksmithing page is almost
done, links are going to be inserted tomorrow and I am adding some class
specific stuff to those pages.&nbsp; I forgot how much I love Mondays&nbsp;
*grin*&nbsp; Hope you all had a great weekend.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/18/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Friday is finally here!&nbsp;
and to top it all off we have a snow day at work so we are getting kicked out of
the building.&nbsp; Should have everything in order by Monday so I'll get those
updates up as soon as I can.&nbsp; Have a great weekend and we'll see you back
here on Monday!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/16/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Work, work, work....gotta love
it!!&nbsp; As you all know the patch will be Thursday morning instead of today
so no news as of yet for the new patch.&nbsp; Believe it or not I have tickets
for the Detroit Red Wing's game tonight so I will have a much needed vacation
from work and home&nbsp; yeah!&nbsp; New pages are almost done so they will be
up VERY soon.</font></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/15/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">UGH!!! real life stuff stinks!&nbsp;
Have a huge project going on at work so it will be a little while before I can
get all the new goodies added.&nbsp; I may not even get a chance to play EQ all
week at this rate.&nbsp; I will hopefully get a chance Friday to get this thing
going.&nbsp; Thanks again for all the great email and I'll keep you posted.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Happy Valentine's Day</font><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">
all!&nbsp; I apologize for not having the updates here like I planned, had about
ZERO time this weekend to work on it so hopefully during the week I can get it
out here.&nbsp; I am working on options to turn on/off the midi music on these
pages, got a couple more emails about it so I am seriously looking into adding
that option, just have to figure out the coding&nbsp; *grin*&nbsp; Still no new
updates for brewing or tailoring, the new patch runs tomorrow so keep your
fingers crossed (even though there is no word of any trade skill updates being
implemented).&nbsp; I am adding some excel spreadsheets for all the recipes for
you to download and print, since it is almost impossible to print from this page
because the text is yellow OOPS!&nbsp; Bad planning on my part.&nbsp; I also
received a list of every MOB in every zone from someone. I am hesitant to post
it here because I do not know where or how the list was acquired.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Be safe out there!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">02/10/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Have a funny email I got I
thought I would share with you.&nbsp; I laughed for about an hour when I read
it.&nbsp; My email just tripled so I will get reply's out to you as soon as
possible.&nbsp; I'll have the links page up on Monday as well so if you want to
be listed here, shoot me an email and I'll get you in there.&nbsp; I am excited
to see how the new rogue enhancements are going to work out (as I am a rogue&nbsp;
*grin*) should be an interesting week.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.. I am positive on Vodka trivial at
135. This<br>
because I did a loooong stint from 120 to 135 making<br>
Vodka for a guild event (2 backpacks of vegetables).<br>
<br>
Very nicely done on the site, but you may consider<br>
having the music only come on if you select it.. it is<br>
kind of hard to explain to your cube mate at work why<br>
your .. umm EXCEL spreadsheet.. is playing fantasy<br>
music.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the site, it is in my bookmarks.<br>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Email has been flying in!&nbsp;
I am almost done with the Blacksmithing section, should be up by Monday.&nbsp;
Getting a lot of great suggestions and input, I am really surprised on how many
brewers and tailors are out there! I received an email from Baradakas of
Erollisi Marr about his results of having the trade book in your possession
while doing a trade skill.&nbsp; You can find it here:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">I would also like to thank <a href="http://www.everlore.com/">Everlore</a>
and <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/">EQ.stratics</a> for listing my link on
their sites.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Sorry for the shortage of
updates, real life stuff was pretty hectic there for a while.&nbsp; No new
updates really, hoping to find out more recipes soon.&nbsp; I have got a lot of
email requesting the midi files that play on this page.&nbsp; I have added a
link here so you can download them.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Thanks for all the great email!&nbsp;
I am grateful for all the great input and will try to accommodate everyone as
much as possible.</font></p>
