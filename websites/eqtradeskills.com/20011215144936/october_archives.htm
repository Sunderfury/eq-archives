studded and reinforced.)&nbsp; Working on getting some pics of all the dyes fine
plate armor so you guys can see what the different shades look like and such.&nbsp;

but I have some zone specific fish you can catch and GET THIS!&nbsp; You can tie
your own fishing flies now!&nbsp; You can purchase a tackle box on the Sister
Island in the Ocean of Tears.&nbsp; So I have added a few fly recipe there too!&nbsp;

added as well.&nbsp; You can find them on the brewing page and in the new armor
