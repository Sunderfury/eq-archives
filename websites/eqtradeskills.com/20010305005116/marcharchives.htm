<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Nothing new going on here, busy
doing home repair stuff during my free time and work has given me VERY little
time to do anything other than these projects.&nbsp; Haven't forgot about you
guys and I hope to have some of the graphics up soon.&nbsp; I may have to change
web hosts as mine is not responding at all to my email problems with them.&nbsp;
Hope you all are well and see you tomorrow.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/27/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Well here it is Monday morning
and it been a while since I updated the site.&nbsp; I have been having problems
with my email for some reason and my hosting service STILL hasn't got back to
me.&nbsp; Here is an alternate address that you can use if the main one does not
work.&nbsp; <a href="mailto:oke@mediaone.net">oke@mediaone.net</a></font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">I hope to have some pottery
pics added soon as well as the guide to help you along.&nbsp; getting poisons
going as well so I can get all the pics done at one time.&nbsp; Hope you all are
having a great time out there and talk to ya soon!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/23/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Okay! Things are slowing down
at work!&nbsp; I threw up some pottery stuff for now.&nbsp; I am getting the
images together and everything else to get that done and will probably do
poisons next as I am an expert in that field&nbsp; *grin*&nbsp; Any input on any
of the skills you can give me will be greatly appreciated as I have not done
much on the other skills yet and like to master them before I add them to the
site (so I know a little bit about what I am posting).&nbsp; Have been getting a
lot of emails from folks and getting a charge out of that, you have been sending
in some GREAT input and I really appreciate it.&nbsp; Looking forward to the
weekend to get some REAL play time in and tomorrow is FRIDAY WOO!&nbsp; Have fun
out there and see you soon!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/21/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">I have to apologize for missing
the update yesterday, our firewall here went down and it was TOTAL chaos on the
floor today.&nbsp; Repercussions today as well so I will see if I can get
something up here a little later this afternoon.&nbsp; Stay safe out there and
I'll see what I can do after this &quot;issue&quot; gets cleared up!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/19/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Updated the guild roster and
made a few tweeks to the site.&nbsp; Will be doing a large update tomorrow.&nbsp;
Hope you all had a great weekend and we'll see you tomorrow!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/17/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">Happy St. Patrick's Day!!!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="4">There will not be too many
updates today and I will be in a drunken stupor in about 2 hours after work!&nbsp;
Hope you guys are having a great day and If I am able I will be brewing online
tonight so stop by and have a drink!&nbsp; Made a few additions to the burning
rapier quest and I hope to get my rapier tonight (if I don't pass out *grin*)&nbsp;
Have a great day, weekend, whatever and I'll see you guys tomorrow.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/15/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Sorry about the no updates
yesterday, I am upgrading my PC and WOW!!&nbsp; Let me tell you about the beast
I have now.&nbsp; Athalon 700, 384mb RAM, 30GB Hard drive, HP 8X burner, G-Force
annihilator Pro video card, SB 512 soundcard.&nbsp; This thing is a powerhouse!&nbsp;
Well enough of that, still working on that burning rapier quest, just need the
dang Sparkle Purse and I can finish this thing!&nbsp; Then of course I will be
completely focused on the rest of the skills being added.&nbsp; A note for all
you rogues out there, take a look at Allahkazam's new poll he has running, last
I checked rogues were number 1 on classes that people would not group with at
28% !!&nbsp; Followed by Shadowknights at 14%.&nbsp; And here I thought rogues
were getting back up there with the new evade skill and not being a mana sponge
for the healers anymore. *sigh*&nbsp; Oh well, rogues still rock and can out
damage ANY other class out there except for monks and of course high level
nukers.&nbsp; Hope you all are having a great time out there and I'll get more
goodies up here soon.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/13/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Added a few more pics to the
burning rapier quest page.&nbsp; I hope to have the darn thing by tonight!&nbsp;
Didn't think I would spend more than 16 Hours in Blackburrow waiting for the
friggin cask to drop and now the camp in SOL A at my level is a pain.&nbsp;
Anyway, hope to get the new skills added shortly after I get this new poker.&nbsp;
Stay safe out there!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/10/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Well, been running around like
crazy to get this burning rapier quest done!&nbsp; I have it about 1/2 done and
have a long couple of days in Blackburrow getting all that stuff!&nbsp; Added
some links to the deadly blades section if you guys want <a href="http://www.eqtradeskills.com/burning_rapier.htm">pics</a>
of my progress of the burning rapier quest.&nbsp; Still not a lot of feedback on
skills so Pottery is up and we'll see what after that.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/09/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Greetings all, made some
modifications to the blacksmithing graphics, the forge has 10 slots instead of 6
like the old pictures were.&nbsp; I am capturing images to add the the tailoring
section and more brew graphics to add to the brewing section.&nbsp; Pottery is
coming along pretty well and I should have a partial page and listing up in the
next few days.&nbsp; I haven't received any suggestions yet for the next trade
skill so on Monday I am just going to pick a random one and start going on it
unless I hear from someone.&nbsp; Adding more images to the guild link as well
as they are coming in.&nbsp; If anyone has some funny screen caps they want to
send it feel free.&nbsp; I'll post them in a new section.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/08/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Good afternoon ladies and
gents!&nbsp; Just wanted a few suggestions of the tradeskills you wanted to be
added here first.&nbsp; The ones you want to know about or DO know about, any
input would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I will personally have to start these
skills as well to verify everything and make sure there are no hang ups.&nbsp;
Pottery is next on my list now as I am a master of that skill (making those damn
poison vials *grin*) and will have something up by this weekend.&nbsp; Tell me
what you want and you shall receive!&nbsp; Thank you all and talk to you soon!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/07/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Sorry I missed you guys
yesterday, I just the site moved to a new server and those annoying ads will now
be gone YEAH!&nbsp; Still working on the additional trade skills, hope to have
more up soon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Haven't had much time to play this week so I am kinda
bummed but the end of the week and weekend are looking good.&nbsp; I have a new
email address now so please reply here:</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Well, it is finally here!!&nbsp;
I have my new domain in place and this page will become inactive in a few weeks
once I get everything worked out.&nbsp; I have a new email address now (the old
one will still work if you are using that one) and I am getting ready to add
MANY new pages and skills but unfortunately it won't happen over night so please
bear with me during the next few weeks.&nbsp; Hope you all are making TONS of
cash out there in your trade skills and I'll keep you posted of all the changes.&nbsp;
The new link is listed a little ways down the page so update your bookmarks!&nbsp;
Stay safe out there&nbsp; =)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Sorry no updates today, lots o'
work&nbsp; hehe&nbsp; new site should be up in a few days!</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00ff00" size="5">03/01/00</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#ffff00" size="4">Okay all, to cut down on this
page size I have added an archives section to this site.&nbsp; I also gave it a
little facelift with some new backgrounds because the old stuff was getting
rather stale.&nbsp; GOOD NEWS!&nbsp; I have a new domain for this page and
because of the success of it I am adding all the other trade skills in Everquest.&nbsp;
Of course this will take some time but I hope to have it done within a few
months.&nbsp; The new domain will go into effect later this week hopefully and
it will be located here:</font></p>
