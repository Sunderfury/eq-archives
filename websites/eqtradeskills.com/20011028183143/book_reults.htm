<p align="center">Hi,<br>
<br>
In relation to having a guide book when working on the related skill, this<br>
is what I have (empircal evidence) found (at least with Blacksmithing):<br>
<br>
*	No book or book inside container (including opened containers), you<br>
either rely on base skill or have skill reduced (not 100%).<br>
*	Book in main inventory slot (closed), seems to be base skill level<br>
or slight bonus.<br>
*	Book in main inventory slot open, definite skill bonus.<br>
<br>
I haven't had the time to check this yet, but I have this idea on that might<br>
make leveling a trade skill easier or cost less (assuming basic tasks are<br>
cheaper to perform than harder tasks) :<br>
<br>
1. Perform basic task, till trivial, with book in inventory slot and open.<br>
2. Perform basic task, till trivial, with book closed.<br>
3. Perform basic task, till trivial, without book.<br>
<br>
The reasoning behind this is that if you get a bonus from having the book,<br>
this bonus might make the task trivial at a lower skill level (a book may<br>
have a + to skill level or + to success chance).<br>
