<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well not too many updates as of
yet.&nbsp; I am still waiting for Kunark to get here and haven't had a lot of
playtime anyway.&nbsp; I hope to have some of the new Kunark stuff up
soon.&nbsp; I know there are quite a few changes to the trade skills so keep
your eyes peeled for new info!&nbsp; On a side note, The Deadly Blades are
restructuring.&nbsp; Chevalier Le Blanc is helping me set up the new
guild.&nbsp; I now realize that an all rogue guild will not work realistically
unless you have MANY alliances and are close with other guilds.&nbsp; The guild
will have a new name and will be open to ALL classes.&nbsp; It will be a rogue
guild at heart, but it can never be successful without being balanced.&nbsp; I
will be posting the new name and info as soon as Chev and I work it out.&nbsp;
Be safe in Kunark and hope to see you there soon!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Been a while since I got an
update here.&nbsp; Real life stuff and the holidays are keeping me busy.&nbsp;
Should get a break soon and get more pottery stuff up here.&nbsp; Hope you all
are doing well and hope to see you out there!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">04/12/00</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well, as usual this is a busy
week.&nbsp; Still trying to get more updates up here so keep your eyes open!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00FF00" size="5">04/10/00</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Finally got that darn
rapier!&nbsp; Finished the burning rapier section and added all the new pics so
you can see the rest of the quest.&nbsp; Spent the weekend in Cazic Thule trying
to get a few more pieces of ravenscale.&nbsp; Spent Saturday in the Avatar of
Fear room and ran into some not so friendly farmers trying to get all the
chestguards they could.&nbsp; Of course they didn't want to share the spawn with
another group so they proceeded to KS all the AoF's they could until a GM got
involved.&nbsp; Then when they were told to leave and got a warning, they left
for about 30 minutes, then demanded they get the next spawn again!&nbsp; GM came
back told em to leave and said our group had the next spawn.&nbsp; Of course
this was not acceptable to them so they decided to train all the crap in the
sewers on us and watched my entire party die.&nbsp; The GM did nothing, the
other group took the spawn and that is where I called it quits for the
day.&nbsp; The new &quot;play nice rules&quot; blow a Crushbone orc's ball sack
and the GM's in the game have ZERO authority to do anything but make threats to
other players.&nbsp; I choose not to be an arsehole when I play, too bad there
are those out there looking for all the &quot;phat loot d00d,&quot; and could care about
anyone who plays the game.&nbsp; So Zar the fairy KS'ing monk, and Mudd the
crybaby troll if you read this -- you are two of those arseholes that make
Everquest the way it is.&nbsp; Hope to repay the death sometime soon =)&nbsp;
Well enough venting, I am heading back to CT now to get that chestguard. Stay
safe and beat up a farmer today *grin*</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Well as you can see it has been
a LONG time since the last update.&nbsp; I need to take a break&nbsp; =)&nbsp; I
was sick for a little while and had A LOT going on at work and whatnot so I took
a few weeks off.&nbsp; We didn't miss much, the nice things about trade skills
is they don't change too much.&nbsp; I am of course working on the rest of the
pottery stuff and getting poisons all set to go.&nbsp; Believe it or not I STILL
haven't got the burning rapier yet!&nbsp; I am still trying to make enough money
to buy that darn gem from Norissa Sparkle.&nbsp; I should have that updated this
weekend as I am selling some items to get the money and get that section
finished finally!&nbsp; Hope you all have been good out there!&nbsp; I have a
lot of new guild stuff going on now that I need to get going on so look for some
updates very soon.</font></p>
