<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well, if you couldn't tell this
has been a CRAZY year already!!&nbsp; Can't believe this is the first update I
have been able to get in here since the new year!&nbsp; I have a lot of
corrections to make, been getting a lot of great email from you guys and girls
and I have to say thanks for keeping this place as accurate as possible!!&nbsp;
I don't have the time to check EVERY recipe so there will be errors and I really
appreciate you guys finding them and sending the right one in to me!&nbsp;
Haven't been able to spend much time in Velious. Was there for a little bit
around Christmas but didn't get too far into it.&nbsp; I know there are a TON of
new things out there, just have to find them and figure out what makes what and
what goes where&nbsp; =)&nbsp; Rogues will be happy that there are MANY new
poison recipes coming!&nbsp; Hope you guys all had a safe and happy New Year and
I hope there are no more lapses like this past one!&nbsp; Stay safe out there
and see you soon!</font>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Getting the new pages setup
here!&nbsp; I apologize for the lack of updates, busy as all heck here with
Christmas and the new job!&nbsp; I am getting the cultural smithing pages in
order, taking a lot longer than I thought!&nbsp; I have the barbarian cultural
page done but have the rest to go.&nbsp; Hope to get a few more completed
today.&nbsp; Check the Barbarian section and let me know if that is a little
more helpful and if there is an easier format to read.&nbsp; I hope to get a few
more done tonight after I have Christmas with the outlaws (in-laws *grin*)&nbsp;
Hope you all are having a good time out there!&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">Finally have some free time to
work on the site!&nbsp; The production went really well last weekend. We have
been tearing down all the sets and some of the decorations all week.&nbsp; My
MCSE test went great, passed my workstation and have my server this Wednesday so
I am studying for that.&nbsp; Need a little break from all this studying and
there are a TON of updates that need to be added.&nbsp; Halflings can make their
cultural armor now!&nbsp; Unfortunately Wood Elves are still stuck with no armor
until they get their recipes fixed!&nbsp; I am going to redo the cultural armor
section because that page is just too huge and with the updates and changes,
they will be easier to track.&nbsp; I did get my copy of Velious in but haven't
found the time to even get over there to take a look at it yet!&nbsp; I hope to
get some time in this weekend!&nbsp; Hope you all are having fun out there and
there will be some brewing, tailoring, and smithing updates added to the site
today!&nbsp; I have been getting a lot of email corrections so thank you all for
submitting the info!&nbsp; Stay safe out there and have fun!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Can you believe that December
is already here!!&nbsp; I have so many things going on right now that I have had
zero time to work on the site.&nbsp; I have a lot of plans, just need to find
the time to do it.&nbsp; I start my new job on Monday, I have my production
going on next weekend and I have my workstation and server exam coming up on the
13th.&nbsp; Needless to say, the site will get very little attention over the
next couple of weeks.&nbsp; If there are any earth shattering discoveries found
then I will of course make time to get you all informed and with the release of
the new expansion, looks like I may be doing just that!&nbsp; Anyway, Sorry for
the lack of updates.&nbsp; I'll make it up to you guys I promise when things
aren't this crazy around here.&nbsp; Stay safe out there!</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="4" color="#FFFF00">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FFFF00" size="4">Well on to the good
stuff!&nbsp; Hope you find some very useful information in here, I have a lot of
different info from other sites and tried to combine it all into one.&nbsp; Good
luck on those trade skills and I'll see you out there!</font></p>
