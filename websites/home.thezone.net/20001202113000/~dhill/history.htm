<p align="left"><font face="BankGothic Md BT">The history of
&quot;The Hole&quot; isn't exactly well known but some of the
history is found from NPC's within Paineel. Following is a log of
a conversation with one of them in a library within Paineel.</font></p>

<p>You say, 'hail Talloth Vara'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'Greetings, Obiuen . You have come to the
Anthenaeum Necromanita. This place serves as the stores of
knowledge for the Seekers of the [Dark Truth]</p>

<p>You say, 'tell me about the Dark Truth'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'The Dark Truth is what all the
[necromancers] in Paineel seek to learn. The [real truth] is far
more interesting.</p>

<p>You say, 'what about the necromancers in Paineel'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'The necromancers here are called the
Seekers of the Dark Truth. The leader of the Seekers is known as
the Speaker of the Dark Truth. The current Speaker is Coriante
Verisue. She does, however, have many [rivals].</p>

<p>You say, 'tell me about the rivals'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'I support Coriante due to my respect for
her. Many have no such respect and covet her power and position.
One such individual is Darton, the Seeker's Chief Researcher. He
is a direct descendant of [Dartain], a hero to our people.</p>

<p>You say, 'tell me about Dartain'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'That is a long story indeed, Obiuen . Many
years ago, the heretics and the people of Erudin had a grand
battle. During the conflicts, great magics were performed and
many catastrophic effects plagued these lands, a good example of
which would be the Hole.</p>

<p>You say, 'tell me about The Hole'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'The Hole is a mysterious creation indeed.
It was also a remarkable find. Within the vast caverns created by
the magical battles, we found something very interesting. The
Seekers call it the [Vault]. Much was done to research the Vault,
but that is a story in and of itself.</p>

<p>You say, 'tell me about the Vault'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'From what I can discern, the Vault was
created from living stone. It was an artifact created by Brell
Serilis to seal the passageway he had opened between the Plane of
Underfoot and Norrath. The Vault was to keep Norrath safe from
some of the more vicious denizens of the Plane of Underfoot.
Something went terribly [wrong].</p>

<p>You say, 'tell me what went wrong'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'During the Seekers' investigation of the
Vault, they weakened its properties. In doing so, it released
hordes of earthen elementals into our fine city. Had Dartain not
[sacrificed] himself, we would surely be an extinct race. </p>

<p>You say, 'how did he sacrifice'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'When the Seekers developed a patch for the
Vault, they sent Dartain in to magically reseal the gateway. He
was set upon by denizens of the Plane of Underfoot, and escaped
into the Vault. There, with full knowledge that he would be
trapped, he magically sealed the Vault once again, allowing us
the freedom to create the [new city] you stand in now.</p>

<p>You say, 'what about the new city'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'You know not of what I speak? You should
have really paid more attention to your studies. The city in
which you now live is New Paineel. The ruins of the [old city]
are in the blight we call the Hole.</p>

<p>You say, 'what about the old city'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'The old city was marvelous indeed. The one
that we have rebuilt barely captures the majesty the old city
once displayed. It is still quite remarkable even in its
destruction, however, it is heavily guarded by the [minions] of
the Underfoot.</p>

<p>You say, 'what about the minions'</p>

<p>Talloth Vara says 'The creatures who now call the old city
home are led by the Earthen Lord Yael. He is a force to be
reckoned with, as he commands only the strongest of the elemental
legions. Tread softly if you see him, for he will not hesitate to
take your life. I grow tired, child. Please, enough stories for
today. I must rest.</p>
