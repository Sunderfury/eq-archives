<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">The
following is a quick and dirty guide, a work in progress, of the
Society of Shadows efforts in the zone off Paineel called
&quot;The Hole&quot;, the old evil Erudite city taken over by
elementals from the Plane of Underfoot. I'll be putting in some
of the text from Paineel eventually about how the place came to
exist so you get a better feel for the how and why of the place.
There's very little information available about this zone due to
the fact that, frankly, the place is HUGE and there's just so
much possible. You could sit a whole raid in one place and just
pull from surrounding buildings and never run out of things to
fight. Respawn would get you before you could completely clear
the surrounding buildings from my limited experience. By no means
am I an expert but I'm sharing what I'm capable of sharing to
foster more interest.</font></p>

the Hole</font></a></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Realize one
thing about &quot;The Hole&quot;, its a big zone. Its such a big
zone that you shouldn't even think about hitting the whole place
and killing all the mobs in one shot. Its just too big for anyone
to spend less than 12+ hours in there and see the whole thing.
That 12+ hour estimate isn't for new raiders, either, but for
people who really know what they're doing. You can clear the
Plane of Hate or Fear faster than you could make it through this
entire zone. This is the biggest dungeon in the game as far as
I'm aware and while Sebilis, for those who've been there, seems
rather large I believe this place has it beat on pure volume. The
Hole is a confusing, complicated dungeon that was once a city
hence you've got the volume of a place like Sebilis but with
buildings so the mobs are stacked much neater and tighter which
causes more aggros from above and below, more mazes to navigate,
and more pure time to get through it all. In this place its
advisable to set your sights on a goal and reach it, not just
explore for the sake of exploring because that results in not
getting very far at all and never really seeing much of the zone
itself.</font></p>

face="Times New Roman, Times"><b><u>Corpse Retrieval</u></b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">You know
you'll have to do it so don't skip over this stuff. Halfling
rogues following Brell aren't aggro to the elementals, fiends and
so forth. They are aggro to the ratman warriors and ghosts but
those won't see through a rogue's sneak/hide potential. We've had
total raid wipeouts and if you don't want to spend the huge
amount of money on coffins then you can get some level 1 rogue
halflings to go drag the corpses up. They can drag them all the
way from the deepest parts of the zone right up to the drop-off
ledge in the entrance area where others can pick them up and pull
them the rest of the way. Best thing to do is get a bunch of
newbie rogues ready at the top and bind them just outside the
zone in Paineel itself. Give them SOW and send them into the
city. When SOW runs off they just suicide and get a new SOW and
head back in again. Pulling without SOW is just too slow to
bother with and since they're level 1 who the heck cares if they
die a dozen times just to get SOW again and make things go
faster.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="4"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b><u>Hole Entrance</u></b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">We start
from, well, the beginning of course. The water up near the zone
out is the place where you'll be waiting for the stragglers to
showup for the raid as we all know there's usually at least one
or two. This is also the place where you'll usually find a single
group of mid-40's people hunting for experience since its all
pretty good experience for one group in the 35-50 level range to
pull down to point </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;1&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> marked on the map. This is also
where you'll want to clear while you're waiting for people to
show up. A group of people in the 50+ range can clear this with
no equipment if they want to so this is just basic warm-up junk
for experienced people. Keep everything down as far as </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><strong>&quot;1&quot;</strong></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> clear so when you move people down
to point </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;2&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b> </b>you'll have no aggro mobs
on your tail.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><img
src="Hole_Entrance.jpg" width="786" height="524"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">As you
progress further in along the purple arrows you'll be moving
along a relatively narrow ledge. People have fallen off before a
number of times and pets can get knocked off this spot and aggro
a bunch of stuff below. Be careful when moving along here and
anyone who DOES fall off shouldn't try to run back up. If they
have to, let them stand and die if they can't handle solo what
aggros them. Too many wandering mobs down around the water to
have them running along to reach you and bring 4-5 mobs on top of
what you might be fighting already.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Where you see
the wandering fiends, golems and elementals at </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;2&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> is where you should set up for
your first small fights. You'll clear out some of the stuff in
this area including golems, fiends (look like imps), and
elementals. Just inside the area marked &quot;Castle
Entrance&quot; is a pair of elementals that you can't see unless
you walk into the room. They're halfway merged with the wall on
either side of the door so give them a smack and bring them out
to kill. Leave the group where they are and let the puller clear
out some other things in this area to be safe. Don't go too deep
either which way or you'll get stuff respawning outside and have
to redo everything in the area.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">This is also
a nice place to setup to kill ratman guards if you want to do
that because the jail isn't too far inside the castle and this
is, supposedly, where the most of them spawn. Last time I was
down I saw nothing but ratman warriors but I believe they're just
placeholders for ratman guards to spawn. You can setup at </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;2&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> just fine and pull the jail if you
have sufficient force to kill the ratman guards. If you don't
know what they are you probably shouldn't try. They're a mob that
is required on the shadowknight epic quest and hence isn't going
to be easy to handle for one group unless you're all 55+ or so.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="4"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b><u>Castle Entrance</u></b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Moving onto
the next area you take the raid through the castle entrance as
shown in the map below. This is where I have to take some cut and
pasting action with Archane's maps because the route we take
doesn't sit well with the way he's set the maps out in files. I
cut some things from some maps to make it more clear the route we
take down into the city and how things flow along that route. The
two </font><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;0&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> represent the same physical point
on both maps. The two should really be end to end but then you
get a very long picture file that isn't as easy to look at on a
web page. Archane had them split off in different files which, in
my opinion, made this a bit more confusing to follow.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Sidebar:</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> If you want to go after Ratman
Guards this is the map to pull using while keeping your group
back at their previous location. The area that shows the pathing
for the ratman warriors is where, I believe, you'll find ratman
guards spawning. We haven't done this hunt yet but others have
and reported ratman guards spawning in the area. I believe that
ratman warriors are just placeholders for ratman guards and why
sometimes you never run into any of them and sometimes they pop
on your head with little warning where you only expected lighter
mobs.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><img
src="Hole_CastleEntrance.jpg" width="626" height="540"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Location
marked </font><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;1&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> is a good place to setup the group
for the remaining pulls. After you've cleared everything to that
point you drag them down from the first staging area up in the
castle entrance. Set them up here and begin pulling the next set
of mobs from the large area just past point </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;0&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times">. The best method for pulling this
that I've found is tag-team pulling due to the high number that
CAN result if you're not careful. If you're new at this or want
to show people how its done, this is the best route. We tend to
use it anyway despite experience because it results in faster,
cleaner pulls through this section. Have your monk/shadowknight
feign in the area around point </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;0&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> and run in to tag some mobs. The
first should be the wanderer which will probably bring a golem
and maybe one or two others as well. You don't need to clear ALL
of this area if you don't want to. You can just clear out
anything that will aggro on your raid as it passes through if
your main destination is the city below. Just run around if this
is the case and bring back anything that picks you up. Make sure
you circle the whole room and get close to all walls because, as
we all know, people on raids tend to spread out to fill the space
available and will running through this area. If you don't have
everything that CAN aggro cleared then you get into impromptu
fights.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Some
wanderers also come up from the ramp leading down into the city
so poke your nose down that tunnel a ways to make sure you don't
run into anything on the way down. Tunnels, small ones, aren't
the best places for a raid to fight even though the mobs you run
into shouldn't be all that difficult to handle. Drag your group
from their staging area down and across the open area as the
purple arrow shows and down the long tunnel where you'll find
yourself overlooking the city itself for the first time.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="4"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b><u>City Fighting</u></b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">City fighting
is relatively fast-paced compared to what you were doing up to
this point so point </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;1&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> where you setup your group after
coming down the tunnel as per the previous map is a good place to
rest and relax before you push into the city. The pulls in this
area are fairly light to begin with so its ok for some of your
people to go AFK, get some food, relax for a bit before pushing
into the city. This is a point where you've got all fresh spawns
ahead of you and nothing about to spawn on top of you or behind
you aside from a lone wanderer or two. Take whatever time you
need now to take a break because from this point until you get
down into Hole Middle is a big, long, non-stop fight if you want
to push through the city in no time at all.</font></p>

face="Times New Roman, Times"> which will be your next staging
area and the one that is going to be the most difficult amount of
fighting since you began. Its also advisable to clear the
building in front of this point marked by 2K because at times
when fighting the lower level of that building can be brought
into the fight by accident. Once everything is clear from </font><font

face="Times New Roman, Times"> to </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;2&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> its time to move the groups up to </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;2&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> and get ready for the next stage
of fighting. You want to do this fast because the last thing you
want when clearing stuff between </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;2&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> and </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;5&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> is to get stuff respawning in that
building. You cleared it to avoid the problem so that will all be
for nothing if that building respawns, aggros, and causes you to
have to redo the whole thing over again in clearing from </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;2&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> to </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;5&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times">.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">The best way
I've found to do this clearing and make it as fast as possible is
for your tag-team to come back into play. Feign one person at </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;3&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> and have the other move up to </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;4&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> and aggro stuff in the bar and
surrounding area. Keep clearing stuff along the path between the
staging area and </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;5&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> with the exception of the mobs in
the area marked &quot;Hole Top&quot;. You can leave these and
just charge your group into the area with a few tanks going first
to make sure you don't have casters or priests with mobs on their
ass running to the staging area. Once you're setup in the staging
area at </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;5&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> then you immediately begin pulling
from there to keep things clear all the way to </font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;6&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times">. This is a bit unique in that
you'll get lots of wanderers coming up through the tunnel at that
spot but once you wipe out a few of them the flow diminishes to
almost nothing. You should be able to clear this stuff fairly
quickly and drag it all back for the slaughter. Once stuff is
clear get the group moving ASAP.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Instructions
that should be given for this run are as follows: <b>Keep
running, don't stop if you get something aggro on you as stopping
increases the chances that more mobs will jump you and that
you'll get caught in respawn. Don't root it thinking that's the
best route because its not. You have pathing on your side on this
run and you'll make it just fine if you don't stop. If you do
stop then remain stopped and die where you stand because if you
stop, root something, and then continue running you'll end up
killing everyone when your rooted mob gets free and now respawn
causes him to bring 4-5 other friends along with him. Bring it
all, all of it, every single mob that might possibly respawn
along the path and don't wait around for others. You are
responsible for one thing and one thing alone, getting your own
ass from </b></font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;5&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b> to </b></font><font
color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;6&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b> without getting lost. Don't
wait for your friend, don't go AFK thinking people will wait for
you. Get through that gate and inside where people are waiting
for you to join them.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">You have to
drive this point home because casters have this tendency, when
chased, to stop and root mobs which is just such a bad idea
unless you're trying to escape to a zoneline. Assign 2-3 tanks
(monks/shadowknights preferred) to stay paused along the route to
guide people and to pick up any aggro mobs. No offense against
caster or priest classes but they tend to panic much more readily
than tanks do if something beats on them when they expected clear
sailing. Tanks make a living at being beat on by mobs so station
a few that can operate independent of your instructions and get
them taking over any mobs that aggro on others. Don't tell the
bulk of the people that, though, or they'll rely on that and stop
and wait for a tank to get it off them. Unless you're confident
the people that are with you are smart enough to act against what
instinct tells them to do just drive the point home to run, run,
and run to that gate no matter what.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Once you're
all through that gate then kill off anything that followed and
anything that is wandering up from above, you're pretty much
home-free if your goal is to get to Master Yael. Nothing you'll
face between you and Master Yael is anywhere as difficult as what
you went through getting through the city.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="4"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b><u>Hole Middle</u></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><img
src="Hole_HoleMiddle.jpg" width="449" height="526"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">From your
entrance from the city you're facing a very long, winding cave
tunnel that leads you down to the Tower. Once you've dealt with
anything that followed you from the city you can begin moving
fights right down to just before </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;1&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times">. There's a few spawns here as well
as a possible roamer so you might want to pull to group instead
of rushing that spot. Once you've done that you can move your
group into the area marked </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;1&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times"> and continue to pull to this spot
to clearn the revenant at the bottom of the open area as well as
the rock golems that are stationed inside the left tunnel. Things
are surprisingly light from leaving the city to finally reaching
Master Yael so don't think that you're somehow missing a whole
bunch of stuff. It is easy compared to getting through the city.
Once you've cleared the stationary golems inside the left tunnel
you can take your whole group in there and walk down the tunnel
for a good long way yet. There's nothing in this tunnel until you
reach Master Yael's place that can hurt your group on the move.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="4"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b><u>Hole Bottom</u></b></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times"><img
src="Hole_HoleBottom.jpg" width="988" height="445"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Keep dragging
the group along with you until you get right down to the area
marked </font><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;1&quot;
</b></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times">and park them
there. You still only have token resistance at this point but IF
you have one of those people in your group who likes to wander
you don't want them anywhere near Master Yael's room. There's
some oddity about the room that you need to know before charging
in and taking him out. The first thing is that there is one mob
missing from the map above, a rock golem that is stationed RIGHT
inside the room on your right at </font><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>&quot;2&quot;</b></font><font
face="Times New Roman, Times">. Grab him and pull him back to the
group to be killed. Once you've gotten him out of the way grab
the fiend that wanders when he's at the point closest to you.
Take him back to group to be killed and then move them all down
just shy of the entrance but tell them not to, no matter what,
approach the room. The two elementals remaining WILL aggro Master
Yael and he will Death Touch the person who gets aggroed. When
you're buffing for taking him out the last thing you want is to
have to ressurect and rebuff some fool who decides he wants to
take a peak and thinks, hey, that mob is far away from Master
Yael, I should help and pull him.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Once everyone
is buffed and ready you treat this like any God level fight and
pick the person who's going to take the first Death Touch from
Yael. You send them along the left wall and given them a few
seconds head start in their run. Then start the group moving
after them all the while keeping as far against the wall along
the purple arrows as you can. If you move straight through the
room you risk aggroing one of the elementals and getting Death
Touch from Master Yael before your designated person has a chance
to aggro him and take it. Last thing you want is to lose a tank
on the first charge because he decided to cut straight across the
room.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Have one or
two enchanters ready to deal with those two because, frankly, its
likely just inevitable that through the course of the fight they
will get aggroed by the brawl that ensues taking out Master Yael.
Leave them mezzed and take care of the big boss and once he's
dead you can deal with the two remaining minions.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Tactics for Master Yael:</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Frankly, we
found him really easy to contend with compared to normal
god-level mobs. He Death Touches, casts gravity flux, but overall
isn't all that difficult to deal with. Only deaths we got were
from DT's because of the relative ease. If you can get *TO* him
you should have no trouble at all taking him out. Just need
enough people to soak up the DT's that might occur over the
course of the fight.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"
face="Times New Roman, Times"><b>Cleanup:</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">Once you've
dealt with Master Yael you can do your ressing back in and have a
look around his chamber. Looking up, waaayyyy up, you can see two
other points in the zone. The top of the waterfall is near the
lake you fought at in the city itself and this is where you fall
if you jump off the edge of the lake. A newbie rogue halfling we
had managed to swim down this waterfall doing some scouting after
our raid but I wouldn't recommend this as a way to skip the bulk
of the fighting. Last thing you want is someone not swimming
properly, falling, and dying from that or your best tank being
the first down, or a cleric, and then getting death touched. You
also then have to contend with four mobs plus Master Yael because
you can't pull the golem and fiend prior to your assault.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times">After this we
left him and moved back up to the Tower area and poked around. We
got completely wiped out and did halfling rogue corpse recovery
to get our bodies back. The tower is packed with ghosts and there
are tactics to take it that I haven't fully explored yet. Once I
do I'll probably update again to reflect what we learned in
taking the tower.</font></p>
