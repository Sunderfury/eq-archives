<H1>LibEQ.a binary distribution site</H1><BR>
As systems become available to me, libEQ will be built on them and<BR>
put on this page for distribution.<BR>
<p>
This library was develed independantly of the original libEQ and is not a<BR>
derivitave work of the original source.  A license for the new library<BR>
has not yet been decided upon, and until such, this is a binary only release.<BR>
<p>
If you would like to see any specific builds, contact me via IRC<BR>
irc.trifocus.net/#showeq, or at casey@trifocus.net, and i will<BR>
see what i can do to obtain access to that platform/os.<BR>
<p>
Note: i'm not sure on what version of SunOS/Solaris the sparc version will <BR>
work on, so if you use it successfully, please drop me a line so i know<BR>
what versions its known to work/not work.  Thanks<BR>
<p>
