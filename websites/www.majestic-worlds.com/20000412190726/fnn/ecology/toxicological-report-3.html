<CENTER><B>Vacuum Spider Venom</B></CENTER><BR>

The vacuum spider, often found buried in ion engine intakes and 
otherwise making a pest of itself to spacers, is feared not for its ferocity 
nor its size, but for its contact neurovenom.<BR><BR>

Since the vacuum spider can rarely puncture a spacesuit, the oil it 
secretes rarely comes into first-hand contact with flesh. Unfortunately for 
spacers, the oil retains it's venomous qualities for up to 20 hours after 
initial contact. What this means is that many spacers find themselves
coming in contact with the venom while removing their suits, or while suiting up in an 
airlock that has been contaminated.<BR><BR>

Persons under the influence of vacuum spider venom have a 1% chance per 
turn per point of damage dealt to them by the poison of hallucinating. Most 
hallucinations are in the form of crawling insects, breathing walls, changing 
and shifting environs, etc, and reduce all actions for that turn by -50% 
(-5CS). Some especially hardened Humma spacers actually contact the venom on 
purpose as a recreational hallucinogen.<BR><BR>

Some effort has been made to both "farm" and manufacture the oily venom 
of the vacuum spider. Farming has proven frighteningly simple since the
spiders accumulate where a suitable source of heat energy and titanium alloys (their 
food sources) can be found. Fortunately it must be kept in a vacuum to remain 
effective, decaying within 20 hours when exposed to an atmosphere containing 
either carbon dioxide, nitrogen and/or oxygen.<BR><BR>

Manufactured vacuum spider venom still has the same flaws, but costs 
significantly more and is stronger (double damage rating, same duration).
As a contact venom, vacuum spider venom needle rounds can be made for most
standard needleguns, and are sometimes available on the Black Market at Cr650 per 
magazine (1d10 damage plus venom effects).<BR><BR>

Another interesting side effect is that the oil ignites when it comes in 
contact with a flow of pure oxygen. This method is used to "burn off" residue 
around engine intakes and landing gear of infested ships or in infested 
stations.<BR><BR>
