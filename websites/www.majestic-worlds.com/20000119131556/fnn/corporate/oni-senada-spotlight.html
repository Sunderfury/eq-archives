Rupert's Hole, Cassidine System - Oni-Senada (O-S) MegaCorp<BR><BR>

	        Oni-Senada formed from the merger of two smaller corporations:
	Onidata which designed less expensive ways to produce products and
	simplfied designs of existing products and Senada Manufacturing which
	was the producer of medium to lower quality merchandise.  The
	combination, while profitable, isn't necessarily the first name in
	quality.   But O-S occasionally works for those who can get by on less
	fancy products, have little money, or need equipment where having it is
	more important than quality.<BR><BR>

	Oni-Senada specializes in look-a-likes,
	generic versions, quality look with cheap construction, and buttons
	which do nothing.  One of the major benefits of the corporation is that
	they rarely put their logo where it is immediately visible or use front
	companies with similar yet legal look-a-like logos.  Not all products
	made by Oni-Senada are low quality, they are just best known for the low
	quality ones, "No wonder...Oni-Senada!!" being a clichhd punch-line and
	"Oni-Senada?!? Oh Shit!!!" being worn famous last words.  Low-tech and
	mass produced items as well as less complicated lower yield high-tech
	items are their specialty.<BR><BR>

	        Many mega-corps do not appreciate Oni-Senada.  They flood the
	market with cheaper merchandise lowering prices and often lower public
	opinion of the other mega-corps products with their look-a-likes.  But
	Oni-Senada is like a hydra, as soon as one area becomes non-profitable
	or risky they move on to the next area just as quickly.  Since their
	production methods are cheap there is little damage that can be done.
	Despite these annoyances to the other mega-corps, Oni-Senada does also
	benefit mega-corps as the public learns to distrust no-names and buys
	directly from chain stores.<BR><BR>

                      <B><CENTER>*amid a firefight*</CENTER><BR>
         "DIE YOU SLIMEY SCUM!!!" our hero cries while running into the
       direct line of fire.  Even amid all the noise and explosions
       everything seems quiet.<BR><BR>
          So quiet that the dry, impotent clicking of his weapon sounds
       thunderous.  So too, the laser rifle shot's hitting his body,
       flesh boiling and steam escaping.  Everything becomes so quiet that we
       hear only the rusting of synth against skin and then the body
       hitting the floor. <BR><BR>
          The gun hits the floor along with the body, breaks part of the
       butt open.<BR><BR>
          There we see an emblem half reflected as our hero's eyes fill
       with water, mouth fills with blood.<BR><BR>
          Then a final booming voice fills the silence:<BR><BR>
                                        <CENTER>"ouhhh...oni-senadahhh".</CENTER><BR><BR>
                     <CENTER>*eyes go lifeless*</CENTER><BR><BR>
            <CENTER>*the vid-goers roll on the floor in hysterics*</CENTER></B><BR><BR>

	O-S's corporate HQ location (Rupert's Hole) just begs for goofy slogans and logos:<BR><BR>
	"Straight from the Hole"<BR>
	"Here's one from the Hole"<BR>
	"What Hole did you pull this out of?"<BR><BR>
