<CENTER>Spacefleet Timeline</CENTER>
   * 6 - 3 pf The First Sathar War (SW I) is fought.

   * 6 pf The Sathar fleet first appears. It attacks the Truane's Star
     system.

   * 5 pf Pale and New Pale fall. The Great Exodus to Dixon's Star system
     takes place.

   * 4 pf The four races muster a spaceship fleet. The Second Common Muster
     is called and put under the command of Admiral Morgaine, who
     immediately moves the fleet into the Cassidine system.

     The Battle of Triad. Morgaine's fleet performs a surprise attack on
     the invading Sathar fleet intent on ravaging Triad. The Sathar lose a
     third of their fleet.

     Dixon's Star system is attacked by the Sathar fleet. Completely
     unprotected it is soon ravaged. Meanwhile Morgaine moves his fleet to
     the Prenglar system.

   * 3 pf The Sathar attack Gran Quivera in the Prenglar system. The Battle
     of the Two Fleets is fought. The Sathar fleet is routed and destroyed.
     Morgaine's fleet is depleted and Morgaine dies in battle. With this
     mutual devastation the First Sathar War comes to an end (2/16/3pf).

   * FY1 (Federation Year) The United Planetary Federation, a mutual
     defense organization, is established (FY1.3.18). All the worlds of the
     Frontier, expecting another Sathar invasion, immediately join. Under
     UPF authority, Spacefleet becomes a permanent defensive force.

   * FY15 The Lynchpin system is discovered by Vrusk. They turn the system
     over to the UPF for development as a military outpost to protect that
     sector of the Frontier. The Lynchpin system is a military secret until
     the middle of SWII.

   * FY35 The First Dramune War is fought.

   * FY40 - 50 Laco's War. PGC and Streel wage the first Corporate War on
     Laco(Dixon's Star).

   * FY49 The UPF steps in on Laco's War and empowers an
     inter-mega-corporate commission to resolve the differences. Other
     mega-corps study Laco's War as a possible legal precedent for solving
     disputes.

   * FY52 Streel attacks CDC operations on Alcazzar(Rhianna). Star Law
     intervenes and averts a potential Corporate War.

   * FY58 Four star systems: Kar, Stella, Whorl, and Wotogon; have become
     so infested with the Blue Plague that the Council of Worlds, the
     diplomatic organization of the UPF, requests that all races recognize
     an indefinite quarantine of these systems. A spaceship seen leaving
     one of these systems is to be destroyed by Spacefleet before it has a
     chance to spread the plague any further.

   * FY59 The entire ecology of the Dralasite homeworld Lomigleeb(Wotogon)
     undergoes a change due to saturation of the Blue Plague. The genetic
     makeup of all living things on the planet is changed. The world is
     permanently set off limits as it is found to be deadly to nearly all
     lifeforms.

   * FY66 Domus(Stella), the Human homeworld, is annihilated in nuclear
     hostilities due to fighting over distribution of the Blue Plague
     vaccine. So complete is the destruction that all life on the planet is
     destroyed. Bases located on Lumina, and in the asteroids are also
     attacked.

   * FY75 The Mechanon Revolt. Mechanons on Volturnus revolt. Only through
     quick action on the part of Star Law is a full-scale war avoided.

   * FY81 The Second Dramune War is fought.

   * FY95 - 105 The Second Sathar War.

   * FY95 The Sathar discover a non-UPF system between Solar Major and
     Solar Minor. They find a small moon orbiting a gas giant and dub it
     Outpost #1. Construction begins on a moon-wide military and industrial
     complex intended as a permanent base for incoming Sathar supply ships
     and troops.

     The Sathar swarm through the Xagyg Nebula and attack Volturnus. New
     planetwide battle tactics are used by the Sathar (including the
     massive use of diversionary, seeded monsters and cybernetically
     controlled creatures). The attack is a feint to draw Spacefleet to
     Zebulon. Task Force Cassidine is dispatched to Zebulon.

     By going through the White Light Nebulae, Sathar Fleet #1 enters the
     Frontier undetected. FY96 Sathar Fleets #2 & 3 attack Solar Minor. So
     overpowering are they that no word of attack reaches Spacefleet.

     Sathar Fleet #1 attacks Kdikit(Madderly's Star). They encounter the
     new Spacefleet fortress on Kdikit. Its resistance is fierce and buys
     the needed time for reinforcements to arrive. Dramune sends three
     frigates and a destroyer from its militia while the UPF dispatches two
     destroyers and two light cruisers from its non-attached ships roster.

     The UPF mines the sector between Cassidine and Madderly's Star. Sathar
     Fleet #1 is driven from Madderly's Star and pursued as it tries to
     makes its way to Fromeltar. All militia ships in the sector, including
     half of Task Force Prenglar, are engaged in the pursuit.

     Task Force Cassidine crushes the Sathar feint on Zebulon, but with
     heavy losses (96.6). The UPF now realizes how vulnerable it is to land
     attacks.

     At this time, the Rim Coalition dispatches the Flight to the other
     side of Klaeok in search of Sathar supply vessles. In return they ask
     the UPF to station Task Force Cassidine half way between Zebulon and
     Capella to protect the Rim home worlds in case of Sathar sneak attack
     through the Muld Nebula.

     Strike Force Nova arrives secretly at White Light (96.7). Admiral
     Niles believe more of the Sathar fleet may attack through the White
     Light Nebulae.

     Sathar Fleet #2 emerges at the Prenglar system(96.8), placing itself
     in front of the remains of Task Force Prenglar. The Battle of Prenglar
     begins two hours later and results in Sathar Fleet #2 scattering or
     destroying the reduced Task Force Prenglar.

     Flush with victory, the Sathar proceed recklessly into the Frontier.
     Strike Force Nova soon engages Sathar Fleet #2 in the Whorl system.
     The remaining Task Force Prenglar ships return and join the battle.
     This running battle results in the eventual withdrawl of Sathar Fleet
     #2 into the White Light Nebulae.

     Sathar Fleet #3 attempts to circumnavigate the Greater Morass(96.8).
     Two weeks later it is engaged by long-range fighters from
     Moonworld(Lynchpin). Without any knowledge of the existance of the
     Lynchpin system, the Sathar forge ahead expecting to find a lone
     spaceship. Instead the Battle of Moonworld is joined.

   * FY97 The Coalition's Flight discovers the Sathar supply route around
     the Xagyg Nebula. They station themselves in deep space and proceed to
     destroy all incoming Sathar ships.

     The final dregs of Sathar Fleet #1, after slipping into the Xagyg
     Nebula off Fromeltar, arrive back at Sathar Outpost #1 and prepare to
     defend to the death.

     The Battle of Moonworld ends (97.1) with three-quarters of Sathar
     Fleet #3 destroyed. The remaining Sathar vessles are forced into the
     Vast Expanse.

     Task Force Prenglar regroups off K'aken Kar(97.2).

     The UPF extablishes the United Planetary Federation Landfleet in 97.5,
     the first interplanetary army raised on the Frontier. Thousands of
     Humma and Osakar arrive from the Rim and enlist, hoping to stop the
     Sathar menace before it invades their homeworlds. Many die for the
     Frontier, but still more stay and become citizens after the war.

     Strike Force Nova secures the Frontier inward from Theseus.

   * FY98 A Coalition Flight long-distance probe discovers Sathar Outpost
     #1 and reports its location before it is destroyed.

     The remains of Sathar Fleet #2 arrive at Outpost #1.

     Despite a desperate shortage of supplies caused by the Flight blockade
     and terrible losses from previous engagements, the Sathar have finally
     completed their construction by FY98.3. Outpost #1 is now a formidable
     fortress.

     The Mist Stone, a sacred Capellan icon, is stolen by Sathar agents and
     smuggled into Outpost #1. The original copy of Reflections of a Humble
     Servant is also stolen and smuggled into Outpost #1. This work is
     considered by Humans to be the definitive philosophy of Dralasite
     civilization. Sathar war ships force the populations of Circe(Solar
     Minor) and Kir'-Kit(Solar Minor) to evacuate their planets (98.5).
     They are transported to Outpost #1 and enslaved. All three incidents
     combine to assure that Outpost #1 is not taken by orbital bombardment.

     Strike Force Nova retakes Solar Minor by 98.7. The fighting is fierce
     and half of the Strike Force and all of the Sathar holding force is
     destroyed.

   * FY99 The Battle of the Blockade(99.1). A reinforcement fleet from
     Sathar space is challenged by the Flight. Half of the Sathar fleet,
     most of them fighting ships, escape but all troop ships are destroyed.
     About one half of the Flight is eliminated.

     The Flight is greatly increased by reinforcements from the Rim. Wing
     #1, the original Flight, rendezvous with Task Force Prenglar. Battered
     and weary, they still insist on joining the siege of Outpost #1 with
     the Frontier forces. This group of Rim spacers quickly gains notoriety
     in the Frontier and greatly enhances UPF-Rim relations. They are known
     as the Raging Rimmers.

     Wing #2 takes up the blockade position. Wing #3 is charged with the
     defense of the home worlds. Task Force Cassidine sails for Solar
     Minor.

     The Sathar begin mining operations on adjacent moons to Outpost #1
     (99.5).

     Dralasites and the Coalition insist that a diplomatic mission be sent
     to Outpost #1 (99.6). The Sathar agree to meet three months later to
     discuss possible treaty. Non-Sathar agents represent Sathar interests
     at the meetings. Diplomatic talks are held for another 18 months with
     no results. During that time the Sathar strengthen their defenses and
     repair their ships. The UPF Landfleet is given time to become a
     formidable army.

   * FY101 Task Force Cassidine joins Strike Force Nova around Solar Minor
     after the talks fail. Four months later (101.7), Capellan Free
     Merchantsmen transport the Landfleet to the Solar Major and Solar
     Minor Fleets. Many Ifshnit remain in the Frontier after the war and
     begin the Free Merchant trade system throughout the UPF planets. They
     will become so firmly entrenched in Frontier life that the mega-corps
     will not be able to force them out, and eventually accept them as
     another mega-corp.

   * FY102 The Battle of Five Fleets. In a pincer action, Task Force
     Prenglar, Coalition Wing #1, Task Force Cassidine, and the remnants of
     Strike Force Nova attack the Outpost #1 system. Outpost #1 itself is
     an almost planet-sized moon and has two moon sized companions. The
     entire year is spent destroying the remnants of the Sathar Fleet, the
     minefields orbiting the planet, the small fighter squadrons the Sathar
     captured from the Solar Minor system, and the moons' mining and
     defensive operations. Lost in the action is the rest of Strike Force
     Nova, except for the battleship Quasar, half of Task Force Cassidine,
     and all but two destroyers from Coalition Wing #1.

   * FY103 - 105 The Siege of Outpost. Task Force Prenglar blockades
     Outpost #1 while Landfleet is shuttled in under intense fire. The land
     battles take two years to complete. At the end of the hostilities
     (FY105.11.20), no Sathar survive and 40% of Landfleet is destroyed.
     Among the Landfleet dead, 30% are Rim citizens. Most of the Ifshnit,
     Osakar, and Humma who have served the UPF during the war settle down
     on the UPF Frontier worlds.

   * FY108 The Frontier worlds decide that a permanent, but scaled down,
     UPF Landfleet force must be maintained at all times for the defense of
     the Frontier.

   * FY110 Outpost #1 is established as a UPF military base. The "Hoppin'
     Hundred and Eighth," a spearhead Humma division, is stationed there
     permanently.

   * FY115 Galactic Task Force and MercCo fight the first post-SWII
     Corporate War over settlement rights on Anakosus, third moon of
     Alcazzar(Rhianna). Hostilities quicly spread to include all seven of
     Alcazzar's moons and over half a dozen mega-corps. The Corporate Wars
     begin in earnest.

   * FY116 The Rim and the UPF enter into multiple defense treaties and
     economic trade agreements, but the Coalition gives severe warnings to
     all mega-corps that their militancy will not be tolerated in the Rim.
     Tourism between the UPF and Rim is established and is immediately
     sucessful. The Frontier now officially includes the Rim worlds
     (FY116.5.3).

   * FY120 Several Saurian escape ships are found travelling through the
     Theseus system.

   * FY131.10 Third Dramune War is fought.

   * FY132 In an effort to stem the growing numbers of Corporate Wars, the
     UPF and Coalition worlds grant Star Law the authority to recruit and
     use mercenaries.

   * FY150 The Grand celebration, commemorating 150 years of the UPF treaty
     is planned for the entire year. Gala social functions, parades, and
     celebrations are planned on every planet in the UPF and even some on
     the Rim.

   * --- Liberty system discovered by the UPF. The planet Snowball is
     liberated from Sathar tyranny. Tacticians, politicians, and
     exobiologists are given a chance to study Sathar machinery and methods
     first hand because of the information gathered by the populace during
     their occupations. It is feared that many pockets of Sathar tyranny
     exist all around the Frontier and Rim. ~135 fy Long-range probe ships
     are sent into suspected Sathar space away from the Rim and UPF systems
     on the other side of the Xagyg Dust Nebula. It is hoped these probes
     can answer the question of where the Sathar come from.
