Shang-Ti Moon, Kidkit, Madderly's Star System - Part of Strike Force Nova, lead by the
Battleship Quasar, were attacked by MercCo warships in an event that not
only stunned the Council of Worlds, but Spacefleet as well. Ordered to
Madderly's Star to stop the fighting before a full corporate war broke
out, SF Nova had just arrived in the system when the attack took place.<BR><BR>

Admiral Wayzen Glashin [Dn], in charge of the strike force, ordered his
ships to the Shang-Ti moon in hopes of seperating the two combatants.
After a stern warning, Admiral Glashin entered firing range of both sets
of ships and the Galactic Task Force warships immediately disengaged and
moved a safe distance from the MercCo and SF Nova warships.<BR><BR>

At this point, the MercCo warships locked onto the Battleship Quasar and
opened fire. Not believing that Merco would actually attack Spacefleet
warships, Admiral Glashin was initially stunned. He then ordered his ships
to return fire in which SF Nova make short work of the MercCo ships.<BR><BR>

The Quasar and Light Cruiser Kraa'kenn both suffered minor damage where
the Destroyer Harsbro was heavily damaged. Two MercCo warships were
destroyed and three heavily damaged before they surrendered to the
obviously superior Spacefleet forces.<BR><BR CLEAR>

Officals at MercCo released a statement saying that the MercCo fleet commander,
Captain Glee Davidson [Hm] attacked Spacefleet without orders to do so and
apologized for the behavior of their employees. The true reasons for the
attack may never be known since Captain Davidson died during the battle
when his ship was destroyed.<BR><BR>

Privately, officals at MercCo and Streel were both outraged at what they
feel is another unnecessary interference of the Coucil of Worlds and
Spacefleet in their business dealings.<BR><BR>
