Anker, Zebulon System - The Society for the Standard Day announced it's annual awards, this time
for 150 f.y. The Science Award went to Cuk Zebon [Hm], one of the leading scientists on
the void. His latest improvements in the stability and reliablity of the void drive has not
only gotten him fame, but has allowed the Wolfbane Development Corp to become the leader
of Void Drive production. The Art Award was a huge surprise, as dark horse Roya Revorand [Dm]
beat out many more well known artists. Roya's most noteworthy artwork dealt with human male
subjects and very cold sand shark eggs. The Humanities Award was awarded to Neovan [Dn], a well
known Dralasite Rights leader. Neovan has started marches on all of the core worlds of the Frontier,
especially Port Loren on Gran Quivera. Despite the political troubles that Neovan has caused, Neovan has
always preached peaceful resolutions to problems and has gained a lot of popular support for the
Dralasite Rights cause.<BR><BR>

The Society also sponsors an annual awards ceremony 
that recognizes independent basic research in the sciences, as
well as endeavors in the Arts and Humanities. The award is called The
Standard Prize, and is accompanied by a sizable cash stipend for the
recipient. Some have noted that recipients of the Standard Prize are often
recruited by the Society for ‘exploratory missions’, and end up in the
center of great events. Zebulon, himself, was among the first
award-winners, and went on to explore that rich and mysterious world.<BR><BR CLEAR>

Official credit for the development and relatively quick acceptance of
universal measurement went to a benign-sounding organization known as
The Society for the Standard Day. But, what was whispered in the
docking bays and shipyard taverns was that a masonic-like organization,
known as the Keepers of the Watch, were really responsible. Many
independent spacers, mostly pilot/owners of small freighters, began to
sport a uniquely styled chronocom, notable for its resemblance to a
sundial.<BR><BR>

The Society was formed near the time of the formation of the Frontier,
and has been active social order that makes little foray into areas of politics
or corporate development, except when it comes to measures and
standards. Then they make their policies widely known, developing
grass-roots support in an enviably brief time. The Society publishes a
variety of informational and educational materials, sponsoring scientific missions, and
supporting research through generous grants.<BR><BR>
