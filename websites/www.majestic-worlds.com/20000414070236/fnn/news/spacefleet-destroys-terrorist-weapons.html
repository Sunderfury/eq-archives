Kraatar Planet, Tristkar System - "This is Pieter Jensen of FNN, broadcasting from the surface of Kraatar.  We
have sighted a squadron of UPFS Eagles dropping from orbit in attack
formation.  Local sources report they have been ordered to attack ground
targets believed to conceal weapons of mass destruction believed by the local
planetary government.  The prime target is the human rebel-occupied stronghold
of Bak'dat.  Star Law intelligence sources report enough vrusk botulin has
been stockpiled by renegade elements of the Kraatar Liberation Front (a human
supremacist cult) to wipe out Kraatar's entire vrusk population, albeit over a
longer time frame than the last KLF attempt at biological terrorism.<BR><BR>

The vrusk government, of course, has been forced by rebel human forces and
megacorp-backed mercenaries to flee to orbit;  surviving elements of the
lawfully-elected vrusk government have claimed sanctuary on the UPF station
"Vigilance" recently built above Kraatar to serve as a neutral meeting ground
for the embattled factions planetside.<BR><BR>

Wait a minute - you are seeing the Eagle attack squadron behind me making its
final approach to the KLF site.  The flight has released their assault rockets
and -"<BR><BR>

"Oh my god - it appears the fighters were armed with thermonuclear warheads!"<BR><BR>

"Sources aboard the UPF carrier 'Divine Wind" have confirmed that the fighters
have in fact destroyed the KLF stockpiles using nukes in order to guarantee
sterilization of the biological compounds.  A Star Law informant, believed to
have given their life by remaining in the base during the attack, had
indicated that he KLF would release the bioweapon regardless of the outcome of
the UPF mission here.  A nuclear strike was the only option open to the
peacekeeping force."<BR><BR>

"Fortunately, the base was located over 50 km from the nearest city, which had
itself been evacuated in recent days when news of the UPF strikeforce's
arrival in-system became public.  However, the death toll is being estimated
in the thousands as the KLF had rallied supporters and their families to the
base as human shields.  It is a dark day for the Frontier..."<BR><BR>
