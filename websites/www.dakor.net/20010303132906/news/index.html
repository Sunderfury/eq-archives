    <td colspan="2"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="1">Vendrix finished his last protruding extremity today.  We call him Knub Muk.  He doesn't like that too much though, all he does is sorta waddle along the sand yelling "Mensa!  Mensa!  EAD!  Short Bus!" and "What the fuck are you looking at?!".  I think Hothgar has gone over the edge too.  He got into a shouting match with a screeching island cockatoo and threatened to train Hand room on it.  I fear Adasmial is in the worst state of mind of us all.  Every 15 minutes or so he leaps naked from the bushes with a large log and severely beats us with it while yelling "Nerf Stick!  Nerf Stick! Bwahahahaha!.  He then goes running back into the thick growth, only to come back 15 minutes later to beat us unmercifully again.  I'm too tired to fight back.  All Hothgar does is run and come back with a gang of island creatures chasing him.  Vendrix flails with his knubs and bites into his ankles.  Oh will this madness ever end? <br><br>Onyyn Serilisson</font></td>

We have built a bonfire on the beach in hopes that an passing aircraft will see it and radio our position to rescue authorities.  Hothgar trained a wild boar on Adasmial yesterday but he didn't notice or care.  He just stares at a tree trunk all day and draws likenesses of the res stick on it with a piece of charcoal.  Xalan left during the night on a makeshift raft he had secretly made.  The note he left behind said he was going in search of exotic island women and/or the nearest CompUSA.  We are tired, we are hungry.  I am slowly going insane.  I used to think Abundant Food/Drink was a lame spell.  Not anymore.  I wonder if any of these sharks know the /loc of the nearest zone.

We expected a tough victory, seeing as we'd have to compensate for the AI and hate changes.<br><br>The actual result? Our best attempt got the normally wussy (in Velious terms) Dain to 50%... and even that involved a massive res-rush.<br><br>What happened, you may ask yourself? Did the mighty Ownage, Inc. lose their glory? Was I, the mastermind of Da`Kor tactics and strategy, Koryo the Tactician, absent? Did our warriors forget to equip weapons?<br><br>No, my dear friends, our loss was quite simple. Our healers employed two strategies. The first involved healing the tanks that were taking massive damage from Dain's 425 quadding stubs. The result : all healers dead in the first minute of the fight. The second strategy involved "being careful when they healed" (I think someone checked Abashi's post on a 2nd comp and suggested we employ The Wise One's advice). The amazing result : all the melee died!<br><br> I know you are all expecting wise words from me as an answer to the question "What now?"<br>Well, I think I can say with confidence... fuck if I know, game is fucking broke.</font></td>
