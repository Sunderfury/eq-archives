    <td colspan="2"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana" size="2">Da`Kor operates as a cohesive unit.&nbsp; Each
      and every person has an important role in the guild.&nbsp; Those not fulfilling this role are removed from the
      guild, it is really that simple.&nbsp; We're not here to screw around with our friends, have heart to heart talks,
      or fight half assed.&nbsp; If you are looking for that, you won't find it here.&nbsp; Simply put, we are out to
      have fun by dominating the challenges of this game.<br>
      <br>
      If you are loot driven or a whiner, stop reading right here.&nbsp; Join a support group and don't waste your time
      and ours.<br>
      <br>
      We only look at people who are 100% willing to devote themselves entirely to our guild.&nbsp; During the many
      weeks for the consideration and sponsorship process, it is up to you to talk with us, group with us, and prove you
      are Da`Kor quality.&nbsp; You are expected to bust your balls if you want to join Da`Kor, because we bust ours for
      our members.&nbsp; If you aren't putting in 100% effort to get in our guild, then why should we put any effort in
      for you?<br>
      <br>
      If you're interested in joining Da`Kor because you want to learn to kick ass first and ask questions later, that
      is a good start.&nbsp; If you want to be in Da`Kor because you see something different and special about us, and
      simply won't settle for anything less, then you are on the right path. Our attitude is not meant to be elitist,
      nor is it meant to offend other guilds.&nbsp; There are a lot of other skilled players and guilds on Erollisi Marr
      - Da`Kor is not for everyone.<br>
      <br>
      If you think your kung fu would benefit our kung fu, send an email to <a href="mailto:recruiting@dakor.net">recruiting@dakor.net</a>.&nbsp;
      Include your character name, level, who from Da`Kor knows you, accomplishments, and any other information you feel
      we should take under consideration.&nbsp; When we receive your email, it
      will be posted to a private Da`Kor board where members can read it.&nbsp;
      You will not receive a reply back.&nbsp; It is now up to you to send tells
      to members looking for groups.&nbsp; Please note that the consideration and sponsorship process can take
      over a month.<br>
      <br>
      We do not consider
      people who are concurrently applying for other guilds.&nbsp; If you want a
      chance at joining, you must be willing to commit to Da`Kor.<br><br>
      We are currently
      looking for new members.&nbsp; You must have high play time and be of the
      following level:</font><br>
