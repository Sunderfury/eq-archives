<p align="center">By: Beldukil Lawbringer</p>
<p>The job of the paladin post 50 is 2 basic things. Tanking and Stunning with some minor healing and buffing thrown in.<br>
<br>
1. Armor: If you havnt gotten rid of all your stat gear yet, do it now and get the highest AC items you can possibly get. Its the only way to survive in Kunark.<br>
<br>
Heres a list or armor you should have<br>
<br>
A. Visible Armor<br>
As much deepwater as you possibly can have except maybe Val arms, gloves and helm<br>
<br>
if not<br>
<br>
As much valorium as you can possibly have.<br>
<br>
if not<br>
<br>
Jasarth scale greaves<br>
Black Enamled CP<br>
Treewave<br>
Sleeves of the ancients&nbsp;<br>
Kylong boots<br>
Skull Shaped barbute<br>
Hero bracer<br>
Bracer of scavanging<br>
Any Ro Armor<br>
<br>
B. Jewlery<br>
<br>
Elec Black Saphire/Sarnak/Forrest Loop<br>
Sarnak Mask, Gangrenous Beetle Mask<br>
Neckalce of Superiority/Mith Torque/<br>
Plat/Gold Fire Opal Rings/Silver Jacinth rings<br>
<br>
<br>
2. STUNNING<br>
<br>
A. Make the Ultimate Stun Hotkey<br>
<br>
Make a social key with /cast 1 /cast 2 /cast 3. Make your fasters stun be the top spell gem, your second fastert your second spell gem etc... When ever you hit this hotkey your fastert, least resisted stun avaiable will cast.<br>
<br>
Stuns have several uses and with 2-3 you can be very effective with them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
B. Interrupting With Stun.<br>
<br>
The most important use of stun is interrupting. Paladins are the best spell interrupters in the game by far post 50. No other class keeps 3 stuns memmed and has bash (enchanters carent close enough to the fight to time properly and dont want to risk the mob agroing them).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When fighting casters DONT just bash and stun whenever you can. Time it properly as soon as the caster starts casting hit bash. If you disrupt fine, if you miss immediately hit stun.<br>
<br>
If you only have one stun available dont cast it to interrupt a DD spell from a shaman. Save it becuase the next spell is going to be Torgors and tou will need something to interrupt that spell. If you do nothing else against shaman mobs, make sure its interrupt torgors. It looks like a heal spell when cast with blue effects.<br>
<br>
If you see a mob casting gate continue to cast stun and bash until it is dead. If interrupted once a mob will re cast gate until dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
C. Paladin Mez<br>
<br>
With 3 stuns you can permanatly keep a mob stunned. This is very mana intensive, but can work well with clarity 2 and
eventually you will get a resist and the mob will attack you. Good thing your a tank and dont care  This is useful with two paladins in a group alternating stuns as well. If you have a rogue in your group chain stun when the mob's back is facing the rogue for continous backstabs.<br>
<br>
D. Helping Enchanters Mez (The old 1-2)<br>
<br>
If your puller pulls 2 mobs, stun one a few feet before he gets to the group. This will enable the enchanter to target the mob better since he will be separated from the one you are fighting. Use a dd stun for the first stun, then immediately cast the lvl 30 non dd stun. That way if mez is resisted, the mob will still be stunned and the cahnter can try again. If mez isnt resisted you wont break the mez.<br>
<br>
E. Breaking Mez<br>
<br>
For some reason you cant break a mez with a dd stun and have the mob be stunned. As soon as you dd stun a mob it makes a line for the enchanter unless its been mem wiped or atoned. As soon as you break mez cast the lvl 30 stun to stop the mob from pummeling the enchanter and to reagro the mob onto you.<br>
<br>
F. Misc. Enchanter Helping<br>
<br>
Watch the enchanters health in battle. If it starts to drop it means a mob broke mez and is pummeling the enchanter. Turn off auto attack and use the lvl 30 stun on the mob so the enchanter can remez. If you leave auto attack on you may accidentily break the mex so turn it off. Then go back to the mob you are killing.<br>
<br>
G. Taunting with Stun<br>
<br>
Stun is one of the most effective taunts in the game. Not only does it taunt, but it stops the mob from hitting whoever its currently on. If one stun fails to taunt, just keep stunning until it does.<br>
<br>
3. Pulling<br>
<br>
Forget the lull line. It rarely works and when it does the lulled mobs get agrod from bad pathing anyway. Its pretty useless except in rare occasions.<br>
Use a shield when pulling and switch to 2h if you want to after pull for the extra ac and resists.<br>
<br>
<br>
With 2 mobs pull with stun and have someone root the stunned mob when it comes just before it gets to the group if you dont have an enchanter. Rooting to pull sometimes has the unintended consequence of auto pulling any roamers that go by the rooted mob. Root pulling is fine, if you know the area well enough that there will be no roamers.<br>
<br>
If you have 3 mobs, root to pull then root one of the remaining 2 on the way back. Instill is too slow to channel through most of the time so use regular root to park when the mob is beating on you.<br>
<br>
4. Parking.<br>
<br>
If you need to park a mob becuase you have no enchanter. Use stun to agro it on you and slowly move it away from the group. Then either root it..or have someone else cast a longer lasting root like instill on it. Another option is the chain mez noted above<br>
<br>
5. Healing<br>
<br>
Paladin healing power goes way down post 50 becuase of the number of HP tanks now have buffed and the fact that post battle healing is more or less useless when you can just wait for the next cheal.<br>
<br>
Its still usefull in small zone groups with no cleric (which are rare), also a fast gheal can often save a caster until the cleric can heal them. Im only 56. so I dont have supp heal yet, but its not a big improvement with a cleric in the group and with the mana penalty it might not be much mroe efficient.<br>
<br>
6. Divine Favor<br>
<br>
Alot of people dont use this spell, but it has 2 uses. One is to keep it on the enchanter at all times. This will enable them to remez a mob without eating their costly rune up. The second is for the zone run out of sebillis. An extra 150 hp never hurt if you are being stunned by mobs while running out of sebillis.<br>
<br>
7. Buffing<br>
<br>
Your job as a bufer really comes into play when the cleric is low mana. Casting guard, aof, or symbol when the cleric is low mana always helps.<br>
<br>
8. Weapon Selection.<br>
<br>
This really depends on what armor you have and what weapons you have available and what the make up of your group is. If you have 960+ ac without a shield after buffs, a high damage 2h is your best bet. FA, ornate runed blade, rof of lam, granite face grinder etc...unless of course you can get the uber rare Halycon Broadsword. You should be able to interrupt ok with 3 stuns and not need bash. If you are in a caster intensive area might want to use a shield as well for the extra bash unless you have FA. If its below 950 and especially below 900 get a 25 ac shield and use a stave of shielding and once it procs if you have one switch to a Sword of the Morning. In fact if you have a stave, I suggest using until it procs if you are using 2h as well.<br>
<br>
Well this is just a start, hope it helps and when I think of more things Ill add them.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body>
