<p>About these lists: First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of
concerns to be brought to the Live Team. This is not a list of promises, and I'm
certainly not telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or
implemented.</p>
<p>Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here. Epic
Quests, Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests. Those three items
were mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate
examination.</p>
<p>All items are currently marked with NONE for status. Obviously we've already
started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on
the Test Server. I will be updating the status for items early next week to
reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team. I just
wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.</p>
<p>I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will
need to be changes made. So this list is not final. But if you want something
added to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change. At
this point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is
already reviewing the original list.</p>
<p>Thanks for the input so far.</p>

<p>Paladins:</p>
<p>ITEM: Defensive Skills.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Paladins would like an increase in their defensive skills, those
like Dodge, Parry and Riposte. Obviously a paladin should be a good warrior, and
the design was that they would be better at defense than offense. But in making
any adjustment to these skills, the paladin should not become a better tank than
a warrior.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Divine Strength Stacking.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: It seems that this spell does not stack with the 50th level
ranger buff Call of Earth. As these seem to be two of the defining spells for
those classes at those levels, they would like them to stack.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Stunning.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Paladins, like shadow knights, would like to be able to stun
more things at higher levels. Perhaps allowing stuns to work on some of the more
powerful monsters would not be unbalancing. This might be an interesting idea in
conjunction with some other ideas on this list, and might be useful in making
the sword and shield combination the signature of the knight classes.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Bash.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Not only raise the skill cap on this, but perhaps even base a
discipline on it. Perhaps one that would allow all bashes to stun (and against
any creature) for the duration. Perhaps even allowing critical hits with the
shield. Again, this might help define the knight hybrids as users of the sword
and shield.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Lay on Hands.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: There are several requests to make this power better. Giving it
the effect of Complete Heal, allowing it to heal a value equal to the paladin’s
base (unbuffed) hit points, reducing the reuse time gradually for levels over 50
and even a discipline that would turn it into a group Lay on Hands. Also, it
would be nice if there was no way that a paladin could use up his Lay on Hands
on an invalid target.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Yaulp IV.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: There have been requests to add this spell to their lineup at
level 59.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Increased Taunt.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: With their somewhat limited ability to deal damage, paladins
might have trouble taunting. They would like an increase in their ability to
taunt.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Shields.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Perhaps creating better shields for knights. Ones with better
armor class. Perhaps even finding a way to make shields that can proc on a
successful bash.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Wave of Healing.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: The recast time on this spell is 1 minute. That seems pretty
long for a 200 hit point group healing spell.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Celestial Cleansing.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: This spell might not really be an upgrade to Superior Healing.
And the 30 second recast time makes it less appealing.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Flame of Light.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: It seems that this spell does not have a particle effect.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Holy Forge.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Most paladins are unhappy with this discipline. They would
rather see it replaced with a more defensive (or THE Defensive) discipline. It
seems like it might be a fair idea to allow them to have critical hits on undead
at all times (though perhaps at a lower rate) once they pass the level where
they get Holy Forge now. If a replacement discipline is chosen, a shield block
or bash-based discipline might be the direction to go.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Divine Glory (53).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Some paladins feel that this spell is underpowered, especially
when compared to the 51st level ranger spell Strength of Nature. Divine Glory is
a 100 hit point buff. Strength of Nature buffs 75 hit points and 25 attack.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Divine Favor (55).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Some think that the long recast time on this spell is out of
proportion to its usefulness.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Piercing Skill.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: Since two-handed piercing is based on the piercing skill,
perhaps we should raise the skill cap for the knight classes in this skill.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Lull spell line.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: People think this line of spells is too easily resisted and/or
causes too much aggro. They claim to use it more for pulling than for anything
else.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Store bought lances.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTOIN: We should probably add these so that the knight classes can
practice their piercing skill at the lower levels.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: White Armor and Shield.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if paladins in game could look like the one
featured on our art, with the white shield and the white surcoat.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: New Discipline Idea.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: There is an interesting idea floating around for a discipline
that would help make the paladin more useful on raids. It would allow the
paladin to target a PC and, for the duration of the discipline, take half of the
target’s damage in his stead. So if the target is hit for 100 points, the
paladin would take 50 and the target would take 50. The restriction on this
would be that the paladin had to remain within melee range of the target and
that it would not stop AoE spells or environmental damage. The idea is that the
paladin is throwing himself in the way to protect the target.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Deepwater Armor.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: They would like us to re-evaluate the effects on this set of
armor.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Trueheart Shield and Theologian Claymore.</p>
<p>These items are found on the plane of Hate, yet have a basic graphic. It
would be nice to make them look fancier.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Two-handed weapon minimum damage.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: How about making the minimum damage on two-handed weapons a
little higher, perhaps based on the base damage of the weapon, to help bring up
their popularity. After all, they should hit hard.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ITEM: Superior Healing fizzle.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION: This spell fizzles a lot.</p>
<p>STATUS: None</p>
