<p align="center">Detailed Quest Information</p>
<p>To do this quest, you need warmly faction
with the Clerics of Tunare. Click here to find out how to raise faction.</p>
<p>After doing the Jojojunga quest, Tynkale
sends you to meet Tolon Nurbyte in the Forever Inn of felwithe and tell him
&quot;The glory of the mother shines bright.&quot; Tolon has to be forced
to spawn at the inn. To do this, just ask the innkeep &quot;Where is Tolon
Nurbyte?&quot;</p>
<p>He will then spawn in the second floor, last
door to your right. Tell Tolon the passphrase, and he will send you off to High
Hold keep to meet Tearon Bleanixx and tell him &quot;All is not bright above
the clouds.&quot;</p>
<p>Tearon Bleanix was captured and experimented
on by the Tier'Dal and is now an undead skele on the third floor in a locked
room. To get inside, you need to get a key to the royal suite. </p>
<p>You get the key by trying to randomly get the
winning lottery ticket from last years drawing. In East Freeport is a npc shop
named Hallard's Resales. Its located in the EFP merchant square. Talk to Hallard
and he will give you a random lottery ticket when you give him 4 orc pawn picks.</p>
<p>Orc pawn picks are found on various newbie
vendors, and through out E Commons, and West Commons. They are heavy, so its
best to travel light if you want to have maximum carrying capacity. Its also
good for the economy if you just shout to buy them in bulk, since you'll
probably need quite a few.</p>
<p>Since the process of getting the correct
ticket is random, don't get discouraged if you never get the winning ticket.
Just keep trying. The winning ticket is 16xxx. Where the xxx's dont
matter, and as long as your ticket starts with 16 its a winner. Just destroy any
other tickets.</p>
<p>When you get your ticket, return to High Hold
Keep, and give it to Casino Treasurer Lynn (not the banker!). She will give you
the key to the royal suite where Tearon is, and is also needed later on in the
quest.</p>
<p>When you talk to Tearon, he asks you to save
Princess Lenya. He gives you his bracer and tells you to kill Tyrna Sil, a Dark
Elf on the 4th floor of the keep. She is in the hidden area of the 4th floor, to
enter just walk through the first painting you see as you enter the 4th floor
from the stairs. Kill her to retrieve a fish food container. You also get a note
to combine 3 fairy dust and 1 sands of ro in the container to make fish food.
*Don't Eat it!*</p>
<p>Beware! She is caster and can fear. Attacking her may
cause other guards nearby to help. She's about level 35 or 36. Take all the
necessary precautions. You also take a hit to your High Keep faction, including
merchant faction.</p>
<p>Next, you need the key to Princess Lenya's
Shackles. This is done by giving Marlin a silk evening tunic. Marlin is located
in the Rooster's inn in High Hold pass. You can get the silk evening tunic off a
vendor in the merchant square of South Qeynos. Marlin spawns around 6pm or 9pm
at night. Just wait around in room 6. Watch out for the DE in the room nearby
though!</p>
<p>After you get all the components: Shackle Key, Fish food, and
Tearon's Bracer.</p>
<p>Princess Lenya has been turned into a fish in Lake Rathe. She
usually spawns between the 3 spawn fire island, and the small water inlet just
before the arena. To make her spawn, kill some regular fish that spawn in
between there.</p>
<p>Once she is spawned, give her the fish food. Princess Lenya will
spawn, and swim to an island a ways off. Then give her the key and Tearon's
bracer. She will call you a hero, and poof, leaving you with a Royal Amulet of
Thex. Return this amulet and the High Keep royal suite room key to Tearon to
receive the Silent Watch Shield.</p>
<p>Note: Princess Lenya may suicide! Be very careful during the
swimming process. Try not to give the fish food too close to shore, since the
pathing might get buggy around there. </p>
