  <br>
  *Patch Day*<br>
  <br>
  Today's patch addresses a few problems noted by customers since last week's
  big patch. The following changes were made:<br>
  <br>
  - Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum or below
  the minimum.<br>
  - Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of the
  slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br>
  - Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified whenever the
  volume slider was moved.<br>
  - Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association with
  mipmapping.<br>
  - Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the wrong slot.<br>
  - Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those carried by
  dwarves.<br>
  - Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of experience in
  slight disagreement with the server.<br>
  - Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that would do
  around one million points of damage if left to its own devices.<br>
  - Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable by
  anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable.<br>
  <br>
  In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up following the
  patch today. Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god of fortune. We would
  have named the new server under its full name if not for an attempt to avoid
  confusion between the existing &quot;Bristlebane&quot; server (named for
  Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.<br>

Alright everyone, here's what happened.<br>
<br>
As all weapon-wielding pet users probably knew, up until recently pets would
proc weapon effects much more frequently than player characters. We recently
changed this so that they now proc effects with just about the same frequency as
player characters with the same dexterity. The exception is targeted (meant for
only one type of enemy, such as summoned creatures) effects, which will now proc
about half as often as they do for player characters, but will still proc on
anything (this, as you know, is a bug).<br>
<br>
Shortly we will be fixing this bug so that pets with targeted proc items will
only proc on the appropriate target. At that time, we will bump up the proc rate
to match those of any other weapon proc for the pet.<br>
<br>
This only effects weapon procs, not innate procs.<br>
<br>
No pet attributes were changed.<br>
<br>
All pets currently have the same dexterity. It is possible in the future that we
will modify the dexterity of pets based on level and type to make them more
flexible for their masters.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that we didn't mention this change earlier.<br>
