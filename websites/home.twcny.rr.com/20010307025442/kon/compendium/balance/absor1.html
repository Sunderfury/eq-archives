&gt;”Guess this is the appropriate place to mention it; the defense cap seems
too high (i.e. unbalanced).”&lt;<br>
<br>
I don’t agree at all. The only thing that the paladin has defensively that
equals a warrior is the defense cap. Warriors have better armor, skills (like
parry and riposte), and hit points. There is no doubt in my mind that a warrior
will still be better defensively than a paladin after these changes.<br>

&gt;”1) We need a useful, big encounter, uber-mob purpose. We have none at the
moment. My preference would be a defensive discipline such as riposte. We are by
definition defensive tanks. Give us this ability.”&lt;<br>
<br>
I know that just a few lines up I said that paladins, even with the defense cap
increase present on Test, are not the equal of warriors defensively, I am also
not certain that they need any other defensive power. I’ll add this item to
the list. But I am also going to suggest that we make no further changes in this
area for a while, until we get a chance to see what affect the current
improvements have.<br>
<br>
&gt;”2) Fix the level 60 Divine Strength buff, our ONLY useful high level
buff, to stack with the level 50 Ranger buff. We need ONE good buff that makes
us needed and makes us unique in that no other class has it. It has to stack
with everything.”&lt;<br>
<br>
Well, I disagree. The stacking of this spell is going to have to be kept in line
with the other spells. Making it stack with everything just to make it
‘special’ for paladins isn’t a good reason.<br>
<br>
&gt;”3) We need the ability to Stun high level mobs. We are the masters at
stuns. No mobs above level 55 or 56 are stunable, i.e., the message says they
are stunned but they do not stop beating on anyone, nor do they stop their spell
casting.”&lt;<br>
<br>
I can add this to the list. Perhaps allowing more creatures to be stunned would
help a few other classes at the higher levels, without being to unbalancing.<br>
<br>
&gt;”4) Raise our BASH skill. Also a disc to make BASH an unresistable stun IF
it lands, i.e., to interrupt caster mobs, is highly needed.”&lt;<br>
<br>
I’m thinking that adding more disciplines isn’t a great idea. I’m
reluctant to start stuffing in disciplines to fix things. But I’ll add it to
the list, assuming that we do not do something like your number 3.<br>
<br>
&gt;”5) Reduce the reuse time of LOH post level 50. Make it gradually less
until level 60. Make it a Complete Heal at level 60.”&lt;<br>
<br>
No. Look, LoH is good as it is. Perhaps an increase in its healing power is in
order. But reducing the reuse time isn’t appropriate (it’s kind of the basis
power for recast times), and Complete Heal is out of the question. I’ll add a
suggestion for an increase in the healing power of LoH, but I think it’s fine
as is.<br>
<br>
&gt;”6) Add Yaulp IV to our spells at level 59.”&lt;<br>
<br>
Hmmm... I’ll add it. But there is probably a reason it wasn’t added with the
last changes.<br>
<br>
&gt;”7) Raise our TAUNT skill. Again, we are defensive tanks. It is currently
too hard to taunt mobs off of classes which deal much more damage than
us.”&lt;<br>
<br>
Every fighting class seems to want a better ability to taunt. Folks, taunt is a
group thing, not an individual thing. Your group needs to be controlling their
aggro. And we just can’t be setting it up so that any character can flip a
switch to gain the attention of their enemy.<br>
<br>
Again, I’ll add it to the list. But we’ll certainly have to look at this is
relationship to everything else.<br>
<br>
&gt;”Where do i begin. Lets start with the appearance no offense but pally's
dont look &quot;epic&quot; with just a hilt. The proc rate is for some reason
lower than before and i have even saw procs as low as 1 and 2 damage. Something
needs to be done.“&lt;<br>
<br>
The hilt thing is already on the programmer’s to-do list. I’ll add it to
this list too.<br>
<br>
I don’t think we’ve changed the actual proc rate of the weapon.<br>
<br>
I’ll ask that someone look at the damage on this item. I’ll also add to the
list of a suggestion that perhaps we change this effect to something defensive.<br>

&gt;”- raise the Paladin (and SK) Bash skill cap as high as Warriors. Rangers
are as good at Archery as Warriors, why shouldn't Paladins be as good at
Bashing? You can even argue that they should be better, since Paladins use
shield MUCH more often than Warriors (unlike Archery, which is used by both
Rangers and Warriors, yet they share the same skill).”&lt;<br>
<br>
Not better than warriors... but I can add that it be raised to match a warrior.<br>
<br>
&gt;”- give Paladins special shields which PROC something. Much like there are
Ranger bows that proc when they hit, why not give Paladins shields that can
proc?<br>
- give Paladins critical hits on Bash. Rangers have it on Archery, how about
finally giving Paladins (and SKs) a chance to get critical hits by putting them
on our Bash skill?<br>
- increase the likelihood of Bash stunning high level mobs. One of the biggest
problems facing high-level Paladins (lvl 55+) is that our beloved Bash skill,
which we have used and depended on so much since our earliest days, is no longer
effective against high level mobs.<br>
- please increase the AC on our shields...many of us are still using the same AC
25 shields we had before Kunark was released. Why have weapons (and armor)
improved so dramatically since then, yet shields are still providing about the
same AC?<br>
- how about a new skill, called Blocking? When using a shield, it gives you a
chance of blocking an opponent's attack (much like parry and dodge work). This
would give Paladins (and SKs) a unique defensive skill that relies upon their
role as shield-bearer.”&lt;<br>
<br>
In fact, most of this is similar to what shadow knights suggested. It certainly
makes sense to suggest that these two classes have the same sort of skills.<br>

&gt;”One thing that concerns me is the recast times on certian spells. The one
that I've had experiance with is Wave of Healing, our Level 55 Group heal spell.
Why is the recast time on this spell 1 minute? I would see the reasoning behind
a 1 minute cast time if the spell were to heal more than 200hp, but at 55, 200hp
is 1-2 rounds of combat from any mob. I belive that this spell should have its
recast time significantly reduced, or the amount of the heal increased.”&lt;<br>
<br>
I can add it to the list.<br>
<br>
&gt;”Another thing that is of concern is the new 'Celestial Clensing' spell.
Do you realize that it is a worse healing spell than Superior heal, with a
higher recast time? The only advantage the spell has over Superior healing is
that the first 110 hp will happen a few seconds sooner than the Superior heal
will land. The added 30 second recast time just makes it even less useful. This
spell should either cost very little mana, or heal for quite a few more
ticks.”&lt;<br>
<br>
I can also add this to the list. But keep in mind we have a delicate balance to
maintain here. We are already planning to look at upgrades for the two secondary
healers. Too many healers will really impede the viability of clerics.<br>

&gt;”This is kind of a suggestion for all classes, not just Paladins. It
involves 2 handed weapons. Now over the last few monthes or so you guys have
been attempting to make 2h weapons more viable by giving weapons above 40 delay
(rarely is there a worthwhile 1h weapon with above 40 delay) a higher damage
cap.<br>
My suggestion is instead of raising the maximum damage we can do, raise the
minimum. The best idea I can think of at this time would be for the minimum
slash/crush/pierce you could do with a 2h weapon would be the base damage of the
weapon. For Example: Take a Razing Sword of Skarlon... 25 damage 40 delay... my
Paladin has this ( not as my main weapon, but this is for example) and on
average I do about 50ish damage a swing (not counting misses). But every once in
awhile I'll swing for 16 or so damage.”&lt;<br>

Seems like a good idea to me.<br>

to survive and contribute against uber mobs like Venthril Sathir, Trak, Kunark
dragons, and the Velious boss mobs. Right now there's no real reason to have a
paladin along on the raid. I advocate a shield block discipline equivalent to
the Ranger parry discipline. The paladin would have to equip a shield to make it
work.&quot;&lt;<br>

&gt;&quot;1.) More 1HB/1HS and shield options. Many of our signature weapons,
like the Messenger of the Queen, Soulfure, Firey Avenger, and Firey Defender are
all 2 handers. If we are to be defensive hybrids, where are our shields? Why are
so may Paladin only weapons 2 handers?&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
I've been thinking about this. I think what we need to do is determine who will
primarily use what weapon combo, and lead them that way (by no means forcing
them into those roles). I see that there are really three types of weapon
combos, 2-handed, 1-handed and shield, and two weapons. Off the top of my head,
I'd say 2-handers for shadow knights, weapon and shield for paladins, two
weapons for warriors and bards…<br>
<br>
In any case, this is probably something we should settle on and keep in mind for
the future. It seems unlikely that we would actually change the Fiery Defender
into some new weapon and shield combo at this point. But perhaps we can set some
guidelines for the future.<br>

&gt;&quot; 1. Celestial Level 59 improvement on Test is inconsequential: It has
been shown that Superior Healing is better for less mana in every situation
unless one where 110 hp before 4.5 seconds is necessary, in which case Divine
Favor covers this. Celestial Line is supposed to be more mana efficient because
of its over-time effect, yet this spell is LESS mana efficient than Superior
Healing. Like every other Paladin spell, it has stacking issues. You do not need
to nerf its hitpoints healed AS WELL AS its mana cost. Please reevaluate this
spell, it is, in its current form, almost wholly useless, and at Level 59,
laughable.<br>
2. Divine Strength Spell is ARGUABLY not as good as storebought level 51 Ranger
spell and DOES NOT stack. Make the Level 53 Paladin version 150 HP and the Level
60 version 300 HP, OR make them stack. Currently, this is a huge
problem.&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
Ok, I'll add a request to either increase the healing or reduce the mana on the
new Celestial and to look at the stacking of Divine Strength.<br>

&gt;&quot;A larg enumber of people who play paladins want to play the perfectly
noble and good knight. I know the erudites have a quest that involves them
slaying a bridge builder (a quest better for an honorable rogue maybe) but
ghoulbane is such an important weapon (leads to the epic) that it is really
dificult for a Paladin to get one. In a game setting of high fantasy one should
be allowed to play a purely good character who will not stain thier honor. If
this was a White Wolf game of vampire with all its angst this quest would make
more sense.&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
We could probably argue for pages about this… I could tell you that an
honorable paladin would have absolutely no concern for gaining a weapon,
especially if he was taking it from another noble creature…<br>
<br>
But we won't do that.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;- Divine Glory (100hp buff at level 53). Grossly underpowered. Please
consider that Rangers get Strength of Nature at level 51, which adds not only
75hp but an amazing 25 ATK, making it one of the best offensive buffs in the
game. To be comparable in utility, you'd have to make Divine Glory about 200hp
and 10ac, I think.&quot;&lt;<br>

&gt;&quot;- Double check that our piercing skill is capped at the same level as

polearms then you should allow us to have the same skill caps or just forget
about giving us the weapons. Lower skill caps in piercing would make the weapons
less attractive for us in the end, especially with our lower skill caps in
offense and weapon skills compared to other classes.&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
I'm not sure that I agree. But you've also reminded me that there is a fourth
weapon combo (from my list above). I'll have to add it in. And raising the skill
cap will be on my list, though I'd prefer that we just added a new skill for
2-handed piercing…<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;- Lull line: look at the resist rates + add a failure message maybe
even a message about it wearing off.&quot;&lt;<br>

This has been noted with other classes, but I'll add it here too.<br>

Good idea.<br>
<br>
&gt;&quot;And lastly please please add WHITE armour or simply add a SirCoat
(white robe - with Breatplate like stats) for paladins and a nice shield with a
paladin-like image. Just like the cover of every EverQuest game box
shows.&quot;&lt;<br>

This is also a good idea.<br>

/RIPOSTE, or /WEAPONSHIELD (similar to /DEFTTONE).&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
I would very much disagree with any sort of riposte-based discipline. But I'll
add these ideas to the list. (DEFTDANCE, not DEFTTONE: noted)<br>

You mean make it so that you get an 'invalid target' sort of message, saving you
from using it on a useless target. Makes sense to me.<br>

Yes, a very popular idea. I'll add it to the list.<br>

&gt;&quot;Skills/Abilities<br>
1) Defense Skill to 252 (matching Warriors, up from 225). This narrows the AC
gap between hybrid and parent class.<br>
2) Addition of Block Skill when a Shield is equipped (don?t know if this is
possible to code, and seems too powerful to simply give the skill to the
character if it can be used with a 2hS equipped). Block would be another
defensive check the same as Parry, Dodge and Ripsote.<br>
3) Failing the implementation of #2, raise other defensive skills as follows:
Dodge 165 (10 under Warriors from 155), Parry 220 (10 under Warriors from 205).<br>
4) Implement Critical/Crippling hits against Undead for Paladins. Warrior
(parent class) crit against everything in melee. Rangers crit with archery.
Implementing partial criticals makes sense with the parent/hybrid line of
thought, and makes Paladins more fun to play.<br>
5) Scale the Lay On Hands recycle timer based on level. Currently it?s 72
minutes per reset. Other disciplines scale down in time based on level, so this
is not a request without precedent. I wouldn?t think a recycle time of between
30-40 minutes at level 55+ would be too much, and a scaling formula can be
worked out between the current and the new once the team decides on a number.<br>
6) Bash to 240-252 (0 to 12 over Warriors from 200). Paladins and SKs are the
only two melee classes that use shields the majority of the time; so much so
tank looking types with shields are automatically assumed to be a hybrid since
?real? tanks don?t use them. Clerics, Shamans and/or Druids sometimes use
shields, but also sometimes use books or other items in the off hand. A maxed
Bash skill makes sense for Paladins.<br>
7) Disarm and Archery; both skills cap low enough to make them effectively
useless. Assuming they are intended to do more than take up hot key slots and be
a useful pulling tool, they should be raised to levels where they have more than
a remote chance of being useful. Somewhere between 70/75 and the mid-upper 100s
there?s a happy ground, I?m sure.<br>
8) Add the Evasive Discipline at level 56, the Defensive Discipline at 60. Both
should have 2/3rds the effects they do for Warriors (2/3rds of the missed/damage
down percentage, 2/3rds duration); keep reset timers the same as for Warriors.<br>
Spells<br>
1) Move the Armor line down: Guard to 39, Armor of Faith to 49.<br>
2) Move the Yaulp line down: Yaulp II to 30, Yaulp III to 39, Yaulp IV to 49.<br>
3) Move Superior Healing from 57 to 53-54. Reduce fizzle rate in line with other
previously noted comments on SH fizzles.<br>
4) Add Remedy at 57-58.<br>
5) Move Revive to 39, Resuscitate to 49, Resurrection to 56, Reviviscence to 59.
The reason?s pretty basic. Travel spells are shared by two classes (Wizards and
Druids). Damage Shields are shared by two classes (Druids and Mages). Primary
Pets are shared by two classes (Mages and Necromancers). Speed spells (SoW) are
shared by two classes (Druids and Shamans). All the ?market spells? are
available from at least two separate class sources, those spells which are
generally being sought after. Except Resurrections (specifically what people
want when they want a Res, which is some of their lost time back in the form of
returned death XP); Clerics are always preferred since they have the highest
Res. Doubly so since 59+ Paladins are in such short supply. Granting the hybrid
this ability of the parent (Cleric) would not impact the parent?s tactical
abilities, only the support slot. And it brings parity to the market of spells
we all eternally have varying needs for as we play the game. I haven't met a
cleric yet that'd object to help in taking care of the eternal cries for 'Can
anyone XP Rez?'<br>
6) Change Divine Strength to a 300-350 HP buff (up from 200). Create a 200-215
HP version and place at level 55. Create a 100-105 HP version and place at level
50.<br>
7) Addendum to #6 above, also add a Regeneration effect to the Divine Strength
line. 3HP/Tick at 50, 5HP/Tick at 55, 7HP/Tick at 60. Maintain stacking with all
current spells, including Natureskin, Divine Purpose, and druidic/shamanic
Regeneration lines.<br>
Equipment:<br>
1) Add a ?Lichbane? 45-50+ version of Ghoulbane, appropriate for the level range
it would be used in. Basically, an upgraded version of the popular mid level
Paladin sword. The post that mentioned this idea and suggested it be yielded by
questing to turn in Ghoulbane and Soulfire was a good way to go about it. If the
?sub-quest? to upgrade the sword idea could be implemented as well (where you do
a quest for each temple in Norrath and get slight upgrades to your Lichbane,
that?s a great idea that would end up with a final version Lichbane perhaps
10-15% better than the unquested version).<br>
2) Implement additional Shields in game to address the rather sparse shield
choices available to Paladins and Shadowknights who, again, are the only tanks
using them. Between four and eight new shields would be excellent, with one to
three of them coming in at or over 30 AC. Some of the new shields should be
questable, some should be drop; hopefully there will be a division in the method
used to introduce them into the game. Hopefully at least two or three of them
will have useful and functional effects to consider as well.<br>
3) Examine the class-specific weapons available in the game and note the
numbers. Paladins are lacking in class-specific (1hS and 1hB especially) weapons
compared to options available to other tank classes. A little on the quality
side, but mostly on the availability side of the question. Broader selection
would really help shake out the equipment options for the bulk of the Paladin
class population.<br>
4) Reexamine the Paladin Epic; is it comparable to other tank epic weapons? Why
is it 2hS when many Paladins are using shields? Various suggestions already made
adding additional quests that can be done to transfer a 2hS major quest or epic
Paladin weapon into a sword/shield combo would be great additions after balance
issues with the current offering are considered.<br>
Combat Problems:<br>
1) Unstunnable mobs are a real brick wall for Paladins. The Stun line is our
single most combat effective line, the one that gives us the most mileage. Mobs
where stuns are meaningless render a decent chunk of a Paladin?s combat
effectiveness useless. Some encounters should be retained unstunnable for
encounter/world balance reasons; others are perhaps able to be tuned down to
keep Paladins in the game in these situations. Speaking personally, fighting
mobs that cast but are unstunnable and uninterruptible generate intense feelings
of hopelessness. To make an encounter difficult and require challenging use of
skill is one thing; to make an encounter unalterable through any means is
another.<br>
Put another way; sometimes it?s good that you know the mob will get the complete
heal off anyway. Other times, it just leaves you feeling useless at your
inability to have any chance of doing something to counter that which is leading
to your downfall.<br>
2) The proposed spell on Test, Celestial Cleansing (110hp heal-over-time for
four ticks, totaling 440hps healing at the end of the spell, with an additional
tick waited before recasting) is a great way to let a Paladin heal while still
staying engaged in the fight (skip a melee round to get the heal off on your
fellow, then start swinging again the next while the healing kicks in). The
problem are the numbers involved. At 59 mobs double for 110 on a really, really
bad roll. The well documented severity of Velious raid-level encounters should
adequately showcase the disparity between Test?s Celestial Cleansing and the
amount of damage it?s being called upon to heal. The spell idea is solid
however, if implemented in two or three versions and spread across the spell
options for the Paladin. Move Celestial Cleansing to 50 or 51, where it can make
a more measurable impact. Put in a 170-200hp/tick version at about 55, and a
225-300hp/tick version at about 60. The Mana/HP efficiency should be very
comparable to that of ?normal? heals, as you?re trading away time to get more
HPs later, and that should be a tradeoff respected in the costs associated with
the spell.&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
Ok, I know that was a long quote, sorry. I'm using these replies as the basis
for building my lists, so I just decided to use this whole thing. You've
duplicated things that we've covered and all that, but it seems like a solid
list.<br>
<br>
I'm also kind of interested in the idea of a discipline that would allow the LoH
ability to work on the whole group. It's interesting. Probably not going to
happen, but it's still interesting.<br>

&gt;&quot;LVL 55 - PALADIN<br>
Sanctification : Makes a paladin immune from ALL types of spell attacks for a
duration of 20 secs. I specifically include dragon AE-breath types of spells.
Recycle time would be 60 mins, but even the current 72 mins could do.<br>
LVL 55 - SHADOW KNIGHT<br>
Leechcurse : Makes you heal for the damage you deal for 15 seconds. All or close
to all your melee attacks connect while the discipline is active. Refresh time
would be 60 mins, but even the current 72 mins could do.<br>
LVL 60 - PALADIN (This is inspired from another poster's idea)<br>
Holy Shield : Lowers by 1/3 the damage dealt to you by partially blocking and
parrying attacks for a duration of 2 mins. Adversely, since the paladin
concentrates on blocking and parrying hits, his attack rating is lowered by 1/3.
It's reuse time would be anywhere from 30 to 36 minutes.<br>
LVL 60 - SHADOW KNIGHT<br>
Shield of Hatred : Makes you automatically lifetap for the 2 minutes it is
active 1/3 of the damage dealt to you. Adversely, your offensive power is also
weakened by 1/3 of its total value. It's reuse time would be anywhere from 30 to
36 minutes.&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if these are good or balanced ideas or not, I'll let the team
decide that.<br>

&gt;&quot;Please correct me if I'm wrong... It sounds like what you are
proposing to do is to balance hybrids with the current state of the classes and
then to improve the classes that we are based on to compensate them. Won't this
put things back out of balance?&quot;&lt;<br>
<br>
You are wrong. The plan is to look at all the classes at once (more or less) and
balance all of them with each other. It's a complicated balancing act, but we
can do it.<br>
<br>
I was reading the first thread when it ate itself. I managed to read the whole
thing, though, before it got away. So don't worry about that. Just worry if I've
missed a good idea. So please don't repost what you've already said, let's use
this thread to move forward.<br>
