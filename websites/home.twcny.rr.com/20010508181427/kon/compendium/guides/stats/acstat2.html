It all comes down to the fact that Verant DID finally release what stats truly did, and it basically boiled down to that the higher your stats were, the faster your SKILLS went up, not that your existing skills were necessarily more effective.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have the post that Brad made about stats so we can end this stupid debate over stuff that has been hashed and re hashed over?<br>

As you request Syfe, here it is:<br>

Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
In working with the people doing the strategy guide for Kunark we decided to provide them with general information as to what the stats do.<br>
I'm going to post them here.<br>
<br>
This is a change in the sense that we were not going to discuss them or release more info. We changed our minds.<br>
<br>
That said, we're not posting any formulas, and it's absolutely true that some stats have considerably more direct impact on gameplay than others.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We're posting this for clarification, and because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of
twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a year.<br>
<br>
Anyway, here you go:<br>
<br>
DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows<br>
<br>
STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills<br>
<br>
STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath<br>
<br>
INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights<br>
<br>
WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT.<br>
<br>
CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular)<br>
<br>
AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit<br>

Re: An AC verses stats test<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
well first of all im not going to put anyone down for their beliefs. What you belive is your business, and I can respect that. Just to give an example when using my mith 2 hander or GB I really dont notice anymore of a higher average
dmg, or more then 4 or 5 points max dmg with storm str from a shaman. What I can tell you though is when I was lvl 39 i solo'd the WC guards for xp I always had a hard time solo'ing then. I then came here and became wise to the whole ac is king issue. I changed all my stats to ac and i noticed that i could solo them alot better. I was able to hang with them longer wich in turn gave me more time to do dmg and kill them. Where as before i had to use LoH quite a bit when my str was at 145 and dex was at 130. Now my str is at about 114 and dex is at about 90. But again i can solo alot better and clerics dont have to heal me as much. But what you believe is your business and no one has a right to push their beliefs on you. So if you feel that Higher Str and dex is over all better for you then more power to you and I will support you in your thoughts whether i agree with them or not&nbsp;<br>

I honestly do not think that "the higher your stats, the faster you learn skills". Your skills being learned are determined by your int. supposedly. I personally feel that they are just random rolls for when you get improvements.<br>
<br>
As far as melee damage. As said previously in this thread and in countless others: It only effects MAX damage, and
minimally(sp?) effects average damage. From the posts of others on this board, it takes approx 10pts of str to equal 1pt of average damage and/or max damage increase. It does not help you hit more often what so ever(neither does Dex as some still think). That is determined by your skill in the weapon skill plus your lvl vs. the mobs, and the MOBs skill and its lvl vs. yours. I cant find the other one he made that gave more info on the other stats, but here is a post where Abashi "Screwed up" and posted something that he later denies, and tried to retract. He later said that he made a mistake in posting this, and some other (that i cannot find
grr) info on stats. That those are supposed to be one of the "mysteries" of the game.<br>
Quote:<br>
<br>
>>>I give up, which one determines how often you hit?<br>
<br>
Neither. Only your level, offense, and weapons skill figures into the chance to hit.<br>
<br>
STR determines max damage and average damage. Higher STR will raise your damage cap, and will also increase your likelihood of hitting closer to your max. The exception to this is Archery, where Dex determines this.<br>
<br>
Dex determines how often a weapon will fire a random process, and also figures into critical hits for warriors. It also figures into some of the rogue skills.<br>
<br>
-Gordon<br>
<br>
As to why they would put this so called "mystery" info all of the sudden in some guide makes me curious. Could it possibly be to give more variety to the game? /shrug&nbsp;<br>

Re: An AC verses stats test<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Well I have 930 AC self buffed without a shield and the AC does help alot. I also have 133 str and 155 wisdom with my ac gear on so I have plenty of mana to heal and stun.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Now we've all heard people say "dude, I hit for 120 so often with a str buff with my
soulfire&quot;.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We all know the the number of hits over modal damage (magic number) is very small compared to the number of hits below it. Weve all seen eqparse histograms of people with 255 str and we all know str does VERY little to average damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
At some point we all thought stats did something big, but from months of log parsing its CLEAR that stats do very little.<br>
<br>
Now if you are in a group where you never get hit, the extra 3% damage you will do from 60 more str cant hurt. If you use, stun, however, mobs will agro on you and will be hit
ALOT.<br>
<br>
I suggest the the original poster download eqparse like we all did six months ago and actually look at how often he hits for max or even above modal damage (magic number). It can be shocking the first time you see an eqparse histogram how few times you hit for max or even close to max with very high
str.<br>
<br>
<br>
The truth is sometimes hard to come by, but its there if you look.&nbsp;<br>

Reply | Edit | Del here is my AC gear<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I have over 900 ac both when I equip my 2 hander and my shield. I have some good stuff in some areas and a few spots could use an upgrade.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As far as ac gear-<br>
<br>
Head- DW Helm<br>
Neck- Collar undead protection<br>
Hand- DW guantlets<br>
face- Gangrenous Beetle Mask<br>
ears- Golden Topaz<br>
fingers- Jagged band/5 ac 55 ring or the 10ac -7 mr ring is there are no casters present.<br>
Shoulder- Tattered Mantle<br>
Back- Lizardscale Cloak<br>
Belt- Hangmans noose<br>
wrists- DW bracer/hero bracer<br>
Arms- valorium<br>
Chest- Black Enaml BP<br>
Legs- valorium<br>
Boots- DW boots<br>
<br>
1hander/shield- Gouldbane/Trueheart<br>
<br>
2hander- Nathsar Greatsword (alot of people think this sword sucks, but it is fast as hell and lets you get the 2hnder bonus more often- With my noose-25% haste- I can taunt anything off anyone not useing a COF or better)<br>
<br>
I have (self buffed) without my shield an AC in the 920's with the shield in the 950's.<br>
<br>
<br>
I use yaulp (and have been since I got it ) which adds to my ac/str--not factered in the above totals.<br>
<br>
I am a level 53 High elf paladin on Tarew Marr. With the DW armour my str is 102 and my wiz is 127. I have all the weight reducing boxes to compensate for the loss in
str.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I am very pleased with the DW armour (except the color, but it look cool in dark elf mode). I am able to tank very effectively in Sebilis and
Karnor...something I could not do before I had all my DW.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps.<br>

Warriors should also go all ac and hitpoints (even more than paladins). Make sure agility is over 75 and enough str not to be encumbered.&nbsp;<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is my average equipment, tell me where I am flawed. And keep in mind I don't have a million plat to buy stuff like some of you must.<br>
<br>
Head: Skull Shaped Barbute for Magic Save, Exe hood most of the time<br>
Neck: Golden Black Pearl Choker<br>
Ears: Electrum Sapphire Earrings<br>
Face: Plat Ruby Vail for str, Plat Star Ruby Vail for dext<br>
Chest: Valorum Chest Plate&nbsp;<br>
Legs: Valorium Greaves<br>
Boots: Boots of Ro<br>
Hands: Gauntlets of Ro<br>
Wrists: Valorium Bracer and Hero Bracer<br>
Arms: Valorium Vambraces<br>
Waste: FBSS or Drakescale belt<br>
Fingers: Plat Fire Emerald Rings or Plat Fire Wedding rings for AC and hit points<br>
Range Slot: Runed Oak Bow<br>
Ammo: Magical Arrows (I make)<br>
Shield: Mistmoore for Dext, Cracked DW for str and higher AC<br>
<br>
Am I suppose to dump this stuff for all AC items and get a strawspun belt, dented mask, etc?<br>
<br>
I am wondering how having huge amounts of AC helps if you are not doing enough dmg to make the mob turn on you in the first place. That is my entire theory, do my share of the dmg and they will attack me and I don't HAVE to use stuns to piss them off, my weapon dmg pisses them off just fine. Some of you must think having full health at the end of each battle makes you a tank, I prefer to get hit and take
dmg, that means I AM TANKING, not boring the mobs with my wimpy hits.<br>

Reply | Edit | Del This is all we are saying..<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This is all that we are saying. You shouldnt give up AC for a stat as it doesnt make enough of a difference. Of course we all work on our stats to some degree. But if the choice is there between a stat, and some AC I would take the AC. On a few pieces of my gear I give up some AC for a stat, but I feel it is a even trade so i am content with it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Some things to try if you would like, and here is the difference it would make with
ya.<br>
<br>
Your rings: replace them with Jagged Bands, You will lose approx 4 str from that, but will gain 10 raw AC. Of course you say you use the fire opals and those are awsome rings in themselves.<br>
<br>
Earrings: Try getting some dimondines. Easy camp at 50, or you can offer to help a few paladins in your guild to get the hilt for
soulfire. She spawns in the same area and the earrings are a common drop. You will lose approx 2 str from this<br>
<br>
Face: Dented Brass mask is awsome, or if you can get one a Sarnak Hide mask is even better. With the dented you will lose approx 4
str, with the sarnak you will lose only 1. If you are wanted the dex for a weapon proc, try using a Grotesque mask. I think it has the same dex as your veil but will give you 3 AC which is alot better than none.<br>
<br>
Neck: the choker is useless. I think that is the one that gives agil, but I dont keep up with that type of
jewlrey. Anything with AC will help alot, From your simple Bronze neck piece, to something that gives the stat you are wanted with an AC boost. Posiblities are Runed lava penant (easy camp at 50 but boring), Collar of undead protection (20pp
hehe), or if you can get on some FG raids it is very hard to beat the Mithral Torque.<br>
<br>
Belt: For AC the thick leather apron, or straw spun belt. Those are very hard to beat, without getting into the uber
dragon/plane/kunark ultra rare items. The FBSS of course is very tough to beat, although it has no AC rating, there is really no arguement against makeing most of our weapons 18% better.<br>
<br>
Head: The SSB is by far a better head piece than the Exe hood. Once again I assume you use the hood for
procs. I didnt see what weapon you are using, but Ill assume its a GB for now. In places where undead is very heavy
(guk, kith, ect..) the hood is an excellent piece. Although you wont notice a drop in procs if you replace the hood. Against the living, the SSB all the way. If you are worried about
str, you might want to consider the Crested Helm. Although I dont think the str grants the loss of 3 AC, it is better than the exe hood which has only 5 AC
(i think).<br>
<br>
So counting all of this up.. You will lose between 4 and 10 pts of str. From personal experience (using a TBB temperarily one day) you will hardly notice a decrease in damage output. Possibly at most a drop in 2pts off of your MAX damage hit. But you will also gained between 29 and 32 raw AC.&nbsp;<br>
+ 10 from rings<br>
+4 from earrings<br>
+5 from neck<br>
+5 from belt<br>
+8 or 5 from your helm<br>
-------<br>
32 or 29<br>
<br>
This will translate into approx 40 AC going with the higher end.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
So for a cost of losing 10 pts of strength (the basis of your last post "you are not doing enough
dmg&quot;) and a few other stats. You have the ability to gain another Valorium Breastplate worth of AC.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
If you dont think that will help you, next time you try and solo the gaurd you did your testing on. Take your BP off and see if you have to zone faster. I will be willing to bet all of my gear you would have to zone much faster.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that is my opinoin. Take it as you would want to.&nbsp;<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Greetings,<br>
<br>
>>Head: Skull Shaped Barbute for Magic Save, Exe hood most of the time<br>
<br>
I'd wear the SSB all the time, it adds way too much AC to justify the small stat bonuses on the hood. I giggle at 50+ paladins wearing that stupid hood.<br>
<br>
>>Neck: Golden Black Pearl Choker<br>
<br>
Dex/Agi are next to worthless, get yourself a Necklace of Superiority or Runed Lava Pendant, or if you're lazy and don't wanna camp a Steel Collar will do you fine.<br>
<br>
>>Ears: Electrum Sapphire Earrings<br>
<br>
Ugh junk, get yourself atleast a pair of Obsidian Beed Hoops, or Diamondine if it floats your boat. I for one don't like the Gold Topaz earrings, makes me feel
cheezy.<br>
<br>
>>Face: Plat Ruby Vail for str, Plat Star Ruby Vail for dext<br>
<br>
The Plat Ruby Veil I can almost justify since it gives large bonuses to two good stats, but I'd still wear a Steel Mask over it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
>>Chest: Valorum Chest Plate&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Can't argue with that.<br>
<br>
>>Legs: Valorium Greaves<br>
<br>
This should take care of any Agi requirement you feel you need.<br>
<br>
>>Boots: Boots of Ro<br>
<br>
I highly recommend you get a pair of DW boots, fairly common drop in Karnor's, well atleast as common as it gets there.<br>
<br>
>>Hands: Gauntlets of Ro<br>
<br>
Again I'd recommend DW armor for this slot, it's recommended over Val because it is much more readily
avaliable.<br>
<br>
>>Wrists: Valorium Bracer and Hero Bracer<br>
<br>
Nothing wrong here.<br>
<br>
>>Arms: Valorium Vambraces<br>
<br>
Wish I had a pair.<br>
<br>
>>Waste: FBSS or Drakescale belt<br>
<br>
FBSS is fine, throw the drakescale belt away or better yet sell it to a druid/monk. If you need the AC and haste isn't important wear a Thick Leather Apron. Oh and stop spouting off about how you are right and 1000s of hours of testing by 100s of people are wrong.<br>
<br>
>>Fingers: Plat Fire Emerald Rings or Plat Fire Wedding rings for AC and hit points<br>
<br>
I pity any high level character who wears Plat Fire Emerald, go with the Plat Fire Opal rings all the time they are exellent<br>
<br>
>>Range Slot: Runed Oak Bow<br>
<br>
You use a bow when you could pull with stun? Get a Kerran Toy.<br>
<br>
>>Ammo: Magical Arrows (I make)<br>
<br>
I have nothing in this slot, cause I don't shoot anything.<br>
<br>
>>Shield: Mistmoore for Dext, Cracked DW for str and higher AC<br>
<br>
Highly recommend a bark shield or scute shield if you can find one.<br>
<br>
Shoulders - No reason not to use a Tattered mantle, best ac for the slot. All other items for this slot are sub par.<br>
<br>
Cloak of the Icebear is an exellent cloak, only other compareable cloak in that range is the lizardscale which I think is highly overrated.<br>
<br>
This is all stuff you can pick up in Freeport or at your server's baazar. As for the other stuff you've been talking about, I stand with 0 buffs at 902ac, but then again I'm a Erudite;-)<br>

Shoulders: Try for crested spaulders, or a Tattered mantle. I had crested and picked up the Tattered Mantle yesterday for 300pp. Then sold the crested for 120 so i got the mantle at a decent price.<br>
<br>
Cloak : Cloak of the icebear is excellent. Good AC, awsome resist, and gives Hps. About the only thing better would be a hooded black cloak.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As far as camping goes. We all hate it, and it can get boring. But for things like the dimondines you can of course help some paladins in your guild for the hilt like I mentioned. There is no race, so take your time. Consider all of these things small quests if you want. Or whatever will get ya motivated
hehe. The drops in karnors will net exp while trying to obtain them, so it wouldnt be a complete waste of time there. Others will need to be gotten in trade if you dread being completely bored.&nbsp;<br>

Re: An AC verses stats test<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
"I am wondering how having huge amounts of AC helps if you are not doing enough dmg to make the mob turn on you in the first place. That is my entire theory, do my share of the dmg and they will attack me and I don't HAVE to use stuns to piss them off, my weapon dmg pisses them off just fine."<br>
<br>
You must not be playing the same game, then. No amount of stats will significantly change your damage output - the highest strength I saw tested was 240 and average damage (i.e., damage/second) barely changed; less than a single point increase by moving from 60 strength to 240.<br>
<br>
You are wearing the same junk that pretty much all of us were wearing 6 or 9 months ago. If you believe so strongly that stats are so important, how about testing it like we did? Get a log parser
(EQ Parse) and trying fighting with high stats and low stats - report your results. Until then, you are just an armchair quarterback.<br>

60 str verses 240 str equals one more point of average dmg, you are one funny dude, why don't you duel someone with 240 str with your 60
str?, See how it goes. And you guys all claim AC rules, last time I checked monks always have higher AC then my Paladin but can not tank nearly as well.<br>
<br>
I am playing the same game, you must really think you are a comedian, this is Paladins of Norrath right. That usually means folks are talking about
Everquest, duh.<br>
<br>
I appreciate the non wise guy suggestions I will try them out, the suggestions that lead to a minor loss of str being the most helpful, cause I am not running around with 89 str like one guy said he had proudly.<br>
<br>
The suggestion for dw boots and gauntlets, I will certainly use them when I am lucky enough to get them. I am using the best items I have available in those slots.<br>
<br>
I think I will get a Runed Lava pendant, seems like the best neck piece compromise, the 4 str loss argument on Jagged Bands was a good point, and 2 str loss for Diamondine Earrings was a good point, I think I will keep the ruby veil cause it has 2 stats I need. I am getting a dented brass mask to try out however.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I think I have a Bark Shield on my druid, do you really recomend it just cause of higher ac, 3 ac over a cdw shield and losing 9
str?<br>
<br>
Oh some of you may not know one reason for having 125 agility or higher is if you are running to zone you will still run if low on hit points, cause you lose 50 agility when near death, leaving you with 75 agility, could keep you alive.<br>
<br>
And the person who compared different strategies to equipment in a stupid video game to real life religion should seek help or have his medication upped immediately. Same for the guy who made a remark about the ppl thinking the earth is flat, as if my liking str makes me akin to thinking the world is flat is quite offensive.<br>

Re: lol<br>

monks cant tank because:<br>
a) they have barely more hp than a caster<br>
b) the ac is in damage AVOIDANCE not mitigation, when thye do get hit they get hit HARD.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I also play a monk. And AC is king to MONKS also. FOLLOWED by str.&nbsp;<br>

Then post here your damned tests made by a log parser.<br>
I have 86 str, yes 86, and through tests (compared to 160 or so with a shaman buff), the damage output difference was like 0.5-1%. If you don't have anything to show, then you're really like one who thinks the earth is flat.<br>
Btw you play a paladin right? You want to have the mob on you? Did you ever try that spell called stun? Last night I was grouped with a warrior, with my usual 86
str. He was pulling, but after a pair of rounds the mobs were ALWAYS on me. Why? Stun and Holy Might. And believe me, that warrior is a guy who knows how to play.&nbsp;<br>

Re: lol<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Here's something for you str geeks to look at. The MN formula :<br>
<br>
Magic Number (MN) = (2 x wpn dmg) + lvl bonus<br>
<br>
This is used for ALL weapons, yada yada. Magic number is basically the number you're going to hit for ALOT of times. This number does NOT change due to
str, DOES NOT change. The only things that affect this are level &amp; weapon damage. Not even weapon skill has anything to do with this.<br>
<br>
The level bonus formula for two handers (which has been found to change at 51) is as follows :<br>
<br>
2H level bonus (51+) = (Level -7) / 3<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That was parsed at level 52 using a 2hb weapon with a 25 dmg rating (Rod Of Lamentation), 128
str, and 205 skill. Those red bars judge how often I hit for a certain number of damage. The more the red the more times I hit for that.<br>
<br>
Now...<br>
My level bonus : (52-7)/3 = 45/3 = 15<br>
My Magic Number : (2 x 25) + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65<br>
<br>
Anyone care to notice what number the tall red bar hovers over? oh, look : 65. Notice where the shortest red bar is? The one I hit for like 0.01% of the time? Hey look, its at 99, my MAX
dmg.<br>
<br>
Oh, and what does STR affect? Max dmg. and how is max dmg calculated? let's see...<br>
<br>
Max Damage (MAX) = (((Str + Wpn Skill)/100) x Wpn Dmg) + level bonus<br>
<br>
NOTE : I think there is a small flaw with this formula, you shall see in a moment, but it MINORLY affects the outcome therefore is still viable<br>
<br>
So my max would be :<br>
<br>
Max = (((128 + 205)/100) x 25) + 15 = (3.33 x 25) + 15 = 82.5 + 15 = 97.5, round that on up to 98.<br>
<br>
Well sheesh, I hit for 99? Damn.. that str may have tapped me up an extra point, but then again maybe not. Just look at how many times I hit for MAX. Boy, I bet that REALLY made a difference in my taunting abilities &amp; Average damage.<br>
<br>
What if I stacked another hundred str in? anyone care to guess what my max hit would be? and how often I'd hit for that or any numbers near it? Let's see.<br>
<br>
Max = (((228 + 205)/100) x 25) + 15 = (4.33 x 25) + 15 = 123.25, round that off to 123.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind your MN will NOT change due to str. How many times you think you're gonna hit anywhere near 123? You are not changing the MN, but you are adding more numbers you can hit, therefore, YES, str does affect average
dmg, but in 3000 swings and you hit for over 100 say 50 times, you really think that's gonna change much of any outcome in the battle?<br>
<br>
I should also mention that your hit % DOES NOT get affected by str, it is a complete standalone attribute fixated on your level, skill, and mob level and there ac. If you think ATK means you're gonna hit more, you're wrong.<br>
<br>
If you feel like sacrificing ac for str, and then say you hit so much more, and do SOOO much more
dmg, I'll try to keep from laughing back there in the distance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I took my time to evaluate what str means. Alagarn, if you are so inclined to see what str means first hand, go download EQ Parse and see exactly what we have been trying to tell you.<br>
<br>
Stats are expensive, AC is cheap. If you wanna get extravagent, forget braggin about your str because it hardly matters. Rather, go out and buy a suit of
Rubi. People will know you have money, but who cares? I sure don't, and I'm pretty sure everyone but the beggars out there couldn't care less.<br>

My str<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
As for his remark about my 89 str, I am DAMN PROUD OF IT.<br>
<br>
Thank you trueheart, your post is awesome, I am posting a link to this on my guild
webpage. Good debate we have going&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As for not tanking well, I, just as someone else posted, USE MY MANA. I stun, flash
ect. and always take hits.<br>
<br>
Last night I was the only tank in a 6 man group, we had ZERO downtime (mostly thanks to my DW helm) but with my 860 ac the stuff would hardly touch me.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
All things considered though, I think truehearts post closed down this debate.<br>
