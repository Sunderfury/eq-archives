<p align="left"> 
Irak Altil turns its rotted eyesockets towards you. 'Fallen light, upon this

    out of the halls. Twisted, failed, disgraced.'
<p align="left"> Zivilyn says, 'are you disgraced'&nbsp;

Irak Altil says 'Disgrace upon my soul for failing in my duties. Disgrace of

    Irak Altil breathes his words from his skeletal mouth as if wind through a
    valley. 'Sword, shield, breastplate. Twisted to Innoruuks foul will. Must be
    retrieved and cleansed else my soul is to wander for all time.'&nbsp;
<p align="left"> 
You say, 'what sword?'&nbsp;

    Irak Altil says 'Hands of a twisted brother no longer living.&nbsp;

Irak Altil says 'Earthly children of the god of hate. Keeping stand over his

<p>

	Now, the next npc is Reklon Gnallen, who is in the Temple of Quellious in
Erudin.</p>
<p>Reklon Gnallen says 'Hail to you friend. Seek you knowledge or atonement in this
	temple of peace?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You say, 'What temple of peace'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Reklon Gnallen says 'Dedicated to the god of peace, Quellious, is this temple. It
   is here that her clerics and paladins pray and receive inspiration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You say, 'What paladins'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Reklon Gnallen says 'As the clerics are the warm hand of healing, the paladins are
   the stalwart shield of protection, and in times of grave need the sharp
   sword of justice. To our post must we always remain vigilant else dishonor
    might befall us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
   You say, 'I wish to remain vigilant'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Reklon Gnallen says 'To a paladin the upholding of his duty, or honor to his temple
    is foremost. To fail in his duty to stand at his assigned post in time of
    need is a great disgrace. Few are the paladins who have done so, and their
    spirits have been outcast from the god of peace.'</p>
<p>
    You say, 'What outcast'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Reklon Gnallen says 'Harsh though it seems, a true paladin must always
    remain vigilant and dedicated to his cause. If he does not then he might
    find himself fallen from grace.'</p>
<p>
    You say, 'Who has fallen from grace?'</p>
<p>
    Reklon Gnallen says 'There are a few who have done so. Only a few that come
    to mind. Such stories are useful to remember as reminders of our beliefs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You say, 'What stories'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Reklon Gnallen says 'One is the story of the paladin who fell due to his weakness
    in the duty of his guard post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You say, 'what peasent woman'&nbsp;</p>
<p> Reklon
    Gnallen says 'Many hundreds of years ago did this story begin. There was a
    paladin, whose name is lost to all but our oldest leaders, who was among the
    greatest examples of honor. It was his post to guard the chambers to our
    most important halls. His fall was a creature in the guise of a poor peasant
    woman&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You say, 'What sacrifice'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Reklon Gnallen says 'Only this crest and the sacrifice of something that symbolizes
    your strength and purity will release his spirit into the cleansing flames
    of our lady Quellious. Go now. Thank you.</p>

<h2 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#CC9900">The Tainted Items<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p align="left">Irak Altil failed his duty as a guard for the Paladins of Quellious and was
cast out from his Temple. To release him from exile, you need to purify and return a tainted
    sword, shield and breastplate.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#666600">The Tainted Shield<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>
Irak Altil says 'Earthly children of the god of hate. Keeping stand over his dark
    brothers and sisters. Light of clean spirit to cleanse the shield. All must be cleansed and returned to
    the temple for my soul to be freed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    
    The tainted shield drops off Kirak Vil in Nektulous forest. He wanders
    the zone and is about level 56. Very tough, high regen rate. You need at
    least 2 groups of level 55+ to take him down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    
    The Light of Clean Spirit is not a physical component you turn in for the
    shields purification. Just give the tainted shield to Elia the Pure
    in felwithe. She is by the water just before you enter the inner city zone.
    When you hail her, she says that she is standing in &quot;Pure light&quot;
    so since she technically has it already, you dont have to give it to her
    with the shield.</p>
<h3 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#666600">The Tainted Sword<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Irak
    Altil says 'Hands of a twisted brother no longer living.
     The
    sword must be dipped in water pure.
     The
    tainted sword drops off the 'Keeper of Tombs&quot; in The Hole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
     The Pure Water comes from doing a simple sub-quest of helping a peasant
    woman give her sick brother some water. The peasant woman is located in the
    small pond by the Monk guild in West Freeport. Ask her &quot;What
    water?&quot; Then &quot;I will take it to him.&quot; Her brother is in the
    bakery nearby, named Joshua.</p>
<h3 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#666600">The Tainted Breastplate<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<p>Irak
    Altil lets loose an unearthly howl as it gleams with sickly light. 'Upon she
    who lured me from my post. In that place where hatred festers. Painful
    corruption.'
     A
    gem of clarity unlike any other for the breastplate.
     The tainted breastplate drops off the thought corruptor in the plane of
    hate. Supposedly they spawn by killing Scorn Banshees.
     Supposedly,
    the best chance of getting a thought corruptor to spawn is within the first
    few hours of hate when the first scorn banshees are pulled. If we all do
    hate the same way on the servers, then there's probably one or two scorn
    banshees that are PH's for thought corruptors.
     
    The Pure gem is done by doing a subquest in Kaladim. In the mines (take a
    right as you go in, across the bridge), find a miner named Jark.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      You
      say, 'hail Jark'&nbsp;
      <p>
      You
      say, 'some quest'&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      Jark
      says 'Huh? Oh, I struck me some silver. Aint gonna make me rich but it'll
      sure pay for me minin costs. Speakin of, that wife o` mine was supposed ta
      bring me food already. Hey, you, wanna go get me my dinner? I aint got
      nothing ta pay ya with but I sure would appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      You
      say, 'i will get your dinner'&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      Jark
      says 'Har, I know you were a good sort. Nella has it. Shes out there
      somewhere in the lower areas. She likes to visit the temple so maybe shes
      there. Just tell er Jark sent ya and she'll prolly have everythin ready
      fer me.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      You
      say, 'hail Nella Stonebraids'&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      You
      say, 'dinner'&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      Nella
      Stonebraids says 'Ach! I forgot me husbands dinner. Im so sorry. I was
      sendin my wishes ta Brell for health and long life. I was just floatin
      coins into the wishin pool. Usually its for children but things havent
      been so good lately. Here, please take this to him and tell him where I
      was.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      Jark
      says 'Har har! No time fer eatin now! While you were gone I struck me a
      rich vein. Lookie here. Ya ever seen a gem so pure? Its tiny but clear as
      glass. Ya take it Holyomen . Ya showed me some kindness, least I can do.
      Besides, still a share here for me.</p>

<p>
    
     Irak
    Altil says, 'Only the temple can cleanse, only they can touch the artifacts.
    Take the sets of two to the temple. When they are all three cleansed
    seperately take them to he who will grant me atonement.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
     What
    Irak means is only the temple (Quellious temple, which he worshiped) can
    cleanse the artifacts. The
    sets of 2 that he speaks of is the set of the <b> sword</b> and <b> pure
water</b>, and the
    set of the <b> breastplate</b> and <b> pure gem</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
     Give
    the sets <b><i>seperately</i></b> to Reklon in Erudin and he will purify
them.</p>
<p>To purify the Tainted Shield, just give it to Elia the Pure in Felwithe.</p>
<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF">Gleaming Breastplate Log<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p>Reklon
    Gnallen presses the gem of purity against the breastplate. Its dark gleam
    softens and then glows bright once again. 'Compassion is strong in you. Few
    so called heroes would sacrifice their time for such a menial task as you
    performed. Continue your work. Hold this ancient breastplate until you have
    completed your task.'&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    
    Next,
    turn in all three purified items...the sword, shield, and breastplate to
    Reklon.</p>
<p>Reklon
    Gnallen says 'I never thought our order would see these artifacts again.
    With the return of these relics we can now put at ease a scar upon the
    history of our order. This cleansing will atone for his failure. Your soul
    must be pure to have given so freely of yourself. Go now, take this crested
    token of our order. If you wish to free his soul you must undertake another
    sacrifice.</p>
<p>
    
    You
    say, 'What sacrifice'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Reklon
    Gnallen says 'Only this crest and the sacrifice of something that symbolizes
    your strength and purity will release his spirit into the cleansing flames
    of our lady Quellious. Go now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><i>
    
    Turning
    in the crest and a Fiery Avenger to Reklon does NOT finish the quest.</i></p>
<h2 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#CC9900">The End<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p>The last step is to turn in the Mark of Atonement crest and your symbol of
Strength and Purity to Irak Altil.
</p>
<p>Supposedly, Irak Altil is a triggered spawn, but that is yet to be confirmed.
Either way, he's up there in fear somewhere ; ) If you are lucky, you'll see him.
</p>
<p align="left">When you see Irak, he should be an indifferent conning undead
skeleton. Turn in your crest first, then your symbol of strength and
purity...your <a href="fiery_avenger.html">Fiery Avenger</a>.
</p>
<p>Irak will then give you your new <a href="fdefender.html">Fiery Defender</a>,
and run off to sacrifice him upon the altar of Cazic Thule.
