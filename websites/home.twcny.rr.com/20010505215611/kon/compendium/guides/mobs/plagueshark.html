</p>
<p>I've been hunting plague sharks for quite some time now.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I know many paladins like to exploit the bug where they get the shark suspended above the water near Tolo, where they can safely kill the shark without the risk of personal danger.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I am not here to debate whether or not its right to do this - Verant has made it clear they don't want us exploiting any kind of bugs. It is upto each person whether they will risk using that bug.<br>
<br>
My purpose is to provide a simple way of killing the sharks with minimal resources. Here is a simple way for paladins to kill the shark legitimately.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
First to clear a couple things up.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Plague sharks spawn approximately every 1 1/2 to 2 hours.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Plague sharks follow the Seaking Ship when it makes its trip from Qeynos to Erudin.<br>
<br>
<br>
The strategy I use for killing plague sharks is the same strategy I use for killing hill giants.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
When killing the plague sharks you need:<br>
<br>
<br>
a paladin that is in the level range of the shark<br>
<br>
a wizard that is atleast level 30.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Optional: some potions of underwater breathing<br>
<br>
<br>
Paladin:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Taunts the shark of the wizard (this should not be necesarry)&nbsp;<br>
Blinds the shark<br>
Tanks the shark (this should not be necesarry)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Wizard:<br>
<br>
Casts bonds of force on the shark<br>
Nukes the shark<br>
Runs up on the shore like cowardly dog<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here's the strategy:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The paladin buffs himself up.<br>
The paladin pulls the shark off the ship as it goes by.<br>
The paladin pulls the shark near shore.&nbsp;<br>
(I usually pull him toward the stretch of beach between Tolo and the dock, although this can be done in open water.)<br>
<br>
<br>
The wizard is in the water near the shore waiting. As soon as he can target the shark he casts bonds of force on it. (being careful not to snare himself, heh)<br>
<br>
The paladin then casts Flash of Light on the shark and swims away from the shark a little bit.&nbsp;<br>
The shark will head out to sea very slowly.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The wizard proceeds to nuke the shark as the shark retreats to open sea. When FoL wears off the paladins recasts it the instant the shark gets back in range. The shark will then retreat again and the wizard nukes it again.<br>
<br>
The paladin should stay in the water all the time except to go up for air when necesarry.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As soon as bonds of force wears off the wizard should let the paladin know, and the paladin should keep the shark flashed repeatedly while the wizard recasts bonds of force.<br>
<br>
If the wizard gets resisted alot or doesn't have the mana to finish the shark off, the paladin should keep the shark flashed until the wizard meds up.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Note: If the paladin is level 35 and can watch his air meter and the flash of light message (it tells you when flash of light wears off) while he meds, he can keep the shark flashed almost infinitely.<br>
<br>
When I do this I use a level 31 wizard. We have killed the shark tons of times without using the bug.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The main problems I have had are with spell resists. If your FoL keeps getting resisted, the shark will eat your wizard. Don't plan on taunting it, keep flashing him until its successful. The wizard should get out of the water during the time his leather skin is getting torn off.<br>
<br>
As soon as the wizard gets the shark down to about a 1/4 inch of life left, the paladin can tank it.<br>
<br>
I recommend practicing the bonds of force and FoL on a seahorse or a pirhana first to get the hang of it. After you can successfully keep the seahorse/pirhana blinded and away from you and your wizard, then you can try the Plague Sharks.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps any paladin who wants to get his vambraces without using the bug.<br>
<br>
Note: This strategy would probably work alot better with a druid and snare; I usually group with my wizard friend so I haven't tried using a druid.<br>
