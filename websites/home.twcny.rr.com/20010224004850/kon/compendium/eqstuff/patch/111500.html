<p>November 15th, 3:00am<br>
------------------------------<br>
<br>
***Patch Day***<br>
<br>
Today's patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology included
with DirectX 7. You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play
EverQuest. Please refer to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START-->
<a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml">everquest.station.sony.co...ents.shtml</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END-->
 prior to contacting technical support for procedures prior to contacting
technical support.<br>
<br>
Today's patch also includes the new &quot;Sound Engine&quot; that we've been
speaking about for some time. The new sound engine supports additional EAX
features and should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted
in the past.<br>
<br>
*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*<br>
<br>
The /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday 11/18
and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) -->
<img alt="8)" src="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif" width="15" height="15"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->
 to Midnight. All players wishing to have all of their characters moved (on a
per-account basis) from those servers to the new split-server should execute
&quot;/movelog yes&quot; during the windows.<br>
<br>
The physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for a firm time
when it is decided. Remember that corpses will not follow you to the new server,
so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all corpses are looted
prior to the time of the actual move.<br>
<br>
As this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people
being left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention
after the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during the
window. You will need to be present and execute the command in order to move.<br>
<br>
*Spell Changes*<br>
<br>
-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist.<br>
-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing the
secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day.<br>
-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item. The effect was checking
resist on each tick instead of running full course.<br>
-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item.<br>
-- Fixed the &quot;Modulating Rod&quot; so that it can be used by the
appropriate races.<br>
-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned<br>
-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength spell.<br>
-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack appropriately
with other spells that have similar effects.<br>
<br>
-- Modified the &quot;Jonathan's&quot; line of songs to remove the
&quot;skin&quot; effect in order to allow bards to use them more effectively in
combat. In addition, we made them &quot;Self Only&quot; spells rather than
&quot;Single Target&quot; spells in order to allow bards to remain in combat
while singing them.<br>
<br>
*General Fixes/Changes*<br>
<br>
-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on &quot;Sister's Isle&quot; to attack people
who were fighting pirates.<br>
-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game since
they do not have the piercing skill.<br>
-- The &quot;Belt of the River&quot; quest should now work correctly.<br>
-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.<br>
-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.<br>
-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items. Please check your items to see
your changes. Note: Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item.<br>
-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the correct
loot.<br>
-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.<br>
-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.<br>
-- Made the &quot;Gravebinder&quot; a magic weapon.<br>
<br>
-- Repaired the Forager Bag. It was causing people to lose weight when placing
items in the bag. It is supposed to have a weight reduction component, but was
not supposed to cause weight loss.<br>
<br>
-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50. Previously, creatures above
level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill. Now, most creatures
below the character's level can now be successfully taunted. As a note, the
chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller than that of a creature
below 50th.<br>
<br>
<br>
*Client Enhancements*<br>
<br>
-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.<br>
-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the total
number of available socials by 108.<br>
-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to translate
incorrectly.<br>
-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at higher
resolutions.<br>
-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br>
<br>
-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider. Users should now see
differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones that support an
adjustable clipping plane.<br>
<br>
-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show &quot;[LD]&quot; over their heads
when linkdead. In addition, these same players will no longer show as &quot;LinkDead&quot;
in the /who list.<br>
<br>
-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game. /usercolor: Usage
&quot;/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B&quot; where &quot;UserColorNumber is the
number of the color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are
red, green and blue respectively. All changes will be automatically saved to
your EQCLIENT.INI file.<br>
<br>
-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the character
name indicating the server number. As such, you will now be able to have
characters of the same name on two separate servers with different custom
options.<br>
<br>
-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number and
character name. For instance, if your character is named &quot;Bobb&quot;, and
you are on Server 1, your log text file name would be eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.<br>
<br>
-- Added two new entries to the &quot;Defaults&quot; section of the EQCLIENT.INI
file: AttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack turns on
automatically when assisting. Defaults to &quot;TRUE&quot;. ShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE
- Sets whether or not you see the &quot;Soandso is inspecting you&quot; message.
Defaults to &quot;TRUE&quot;.<br>
<br>
-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced. You can now set two keys, a
primary and an alternate, for each function in game. In addition, things that
were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your preference.
Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key, right-click to set the
secondary.<br>
<br>
-- Added the /note command. /note will append the following text to a file
called &quot;notes.txt&quot; in your EverQuest directory. For instance, typing
&quot;/note This is a note&quot; will put &quot;This is a note&quot; on the next
line in the notes.txt file.
<h2 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#CC9900">Patch Addenums<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
<p>Things that were not mentioned in the patch message:</p>
<p>The Fear bug (one that made it so that you could NOT cast spells even after
the fear wore off) should be fixed with this patch.</p>
<p>The client should be updated much more frequently about the positions of your
group and your target. This should significantly reduce the amount of 'warping'
seen by those in your group and your target.</p>
<p>I'll keep adding to this thread if I hear of any others.</p>
