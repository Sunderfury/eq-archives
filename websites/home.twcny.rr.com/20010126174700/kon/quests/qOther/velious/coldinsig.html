<p>Quest Note: This quest *must* be done in sequential order, and by skipping
any part your greatly risk getting your items eaten.</p>

<p>Also, this quest is VERY long and will take at least half a day to complete.</p>

<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF">Step 1: Dain Frostreaver IV<!--mstheme--></font></h4>

<p>When you talk to Dain Frostreaver IV, simply hailing him will not get a
response. If you listen to what the Loremaster of Etiquette says, he tells you
that you must speak in a formal way to the Dain.</p>

<p>Go to the Dain and say exactly, &quot;Greetings and good forutne to you
honored Dain Frostreaver IV.&quot;</p>

<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF">Step 2: Garadain Glacierbane (-2700, 400: Eastern Wastes)<!--mstheme--></font></h4>

<p>Garadain can be found near the Ry'Gorr Orc Fort in a Dwarf Encampment.</p>

<p>He tells you he lost his blanket and wants you to tailor him a new one.</p>

<p>Garadain wants you to tailor him a blanket. You can make it from 2 High
Quality Tundra Kodiak Pelts and 2 High Quality Cougarskin pelts.</p>

<p>The HQ Tundra Kodiak pelts drop off Tundra Kodiaks in EW. They are most
concentrated by the dragon bridge area.</p>

<p>Snow Cougars drop the Cougarskin pelts. They can be found in Iceclad Ocean or
in Eastern Wastes. (IceClad is the better choice, u can pick up some earings
while you're at it)</p>

<p>Combine the 4 items in a large tailoring kit to make the blanket. The blanket
is no drop.</p>

<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">

<p>Return the blanket to Garadain to receive a Copper Coldain Insignia ring.</p>

<p>Garadain tells you that the ring is crappy now, but as your service continues
it will get better.</p>

<p>Garadain also sends you to check on his [nephew].</p>

<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF">Step 3: Boradain Glacierbane, the Great Coldain Hunter (-2500, 1500: EW)<!--mstheme--></font></h4>

<p>Garadain asks you to check on his nephew, Boradain. Boradain is a coldain
hunter and is searching for a rabid tundra kodiak that has been eating Coldain
Dwarfs. Garadain wants you to give you an axe, that he gives you, to Boradain.
He wants you to return with proof that the rabid kodiak has been dealt with and
Boradain is safe. Seek out Boradain, and give him the axe. He is on a small
plateau near the Giant Fort.</p>

<p>This is a very difficult thing to do. Boradain is only level 10 or so, and he
will be wandering around literally sight-seeing most of the Eastern Wastes.
Your job is to intercept any mobs that are in his path and keep Boradain from
getting killed. If you fail, you will have to wait about an hour or two before
he respawns and you have to start over. Also, he makes intermittent stops to take
naps and snack-breaks during his tour of EW. Its pretty cute ;p</p>

<p>Boradain's Sightseeing Tour:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Giant Fort
    <p>Boradain will walk down from the plateau down to the gate of the Giant
    fort. It would be wise to make sure the giants at the fort gates are dead,
    then you only have to deal with the wanderers around the fort.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The Prison Camp
    <p>Next Boradain will make his way to the Kromrif Prison Camp. He will walk
    down into the Frost Giant/Orc hold then wander back up. Make sure you up up
    ahead to kill these two first.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Back again
    <p>Next, he will walk back to his spawn point, sit down and proclaim that he
    &quot;Gives up.&quot; This is where the rabid tundra kodiak spawns. Kill it
    and give to boradain the pelt that drops.</li>
</ol>
<p>Return to Garadain the broken Axe Boradain gives you, and the Copper Insignia
Ring from the blanket quest. Garadain will give you a Silver Coldain Insignia
Ring 2 ac 2 str 2 mr.</p>
<p>Note: This part can be group quested. You can have someone else tailor and
turn in the blanket. Then have that person turn in the copper ring, then you
turn in the broken axe. *Not Confirmed*</p>
<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF"><br>
Step 3: The Skinning Knife<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p><br>
Garadain needs a new skinning knife. he asks for you to make him one. To make it, you need 1
High Quality Walrus skin, 1 wooly rhino horn, and 1 skinning rock. Combine these items in a forge and it yields the
Coldain Skining knife that Garadain needs. This item is not no drop, so someone
else can make it for you. Making it is trivial at 190 skill. Return to Garadain and give him the silver insignia ring and the skinning knife.
You get the Gold Coldain Insignia Ring 3ac 3str 3mr.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF">Step 4: The Smithing Knife<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p>This part gets a bit tricky. Garadain says the knife was good but its not quite up to his specs so he wants a coldain smithing hammer to fix the knife.
Speaking with him further he says that Tain Frostbight has one. Garadain gives you a note to Tain.
When asked about Tain, Garadain says he left a short time ago to settle a score with a certain Kromrif.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Head down to -4900, -2500 (or very close to there). Tain Frosthammer (not
Frostbight) says he is in trouble and needs help. Do not tell him you will help him
until you are buffed up and ready for a battle! When you tell Tain you will help him, he says that Khrak is coming for him with his war party. The giants
will spawn when you tell him you will help him. Just east, near the bridge, 4 giants spawn. one being Khrak.
Killing Khrak leaves the frost elixir off of his body. Give Tain the Frost elixir and he will give you the coldain smithing hammer.</p>
<p>Note: Make sure Tain does not die. People have posted that Tain will eat the
elixer if he dies and you give it to the respawned tain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Return to Garadain and give him the hammer and the gold ring and he will return to you the Platinum Coldain Insignia Ring
4ac 4str 4mr.</p>
<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF">Step 5: The Ry'Gorr Orc Invasion<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p>Garadain tells you of some impending orc danger. he asks that you find the Ry'Gorr messenger and get his invasion plans.
The Ry'Gorr messenger roams between the giant town and the orc fort. He is often
spotted near the Prison Camp and the Ry'Gorr orc fort.</p>
<p>When you get the invasion plans, you need to turn them into <b> the coldain
lookout</b>. He is in same camp as Garadain. When you give him the plans, a group of 6 orcs will spawn.
A named orc, Scarbrow, 2 Ry'Gorr oracles, and 3 Orc Invaders will spawn about
200 feet west of the camp. This is tough battle so make sure you have chanter to mez.
The orcs were blue to a level 54.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you are read to engage the orcs as soon as the spawn. If they reach
the dwarf camp, the dwarfs will aggro and KS the mobs from you. Return the
scarbrow's head and your platinum ring. He gives you an Obsidian Coldain Insignia
Ring 5ac 5str 5mr. </p>
<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF">Step 6: The Elite Coldain Fighting Squad<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p>Garadain wants you to seek out an force of Elite Coldain Dwarf Fighters and
their Doggy Companions. They were on a strike attack to Kael, and have not been
heard from. He wants proof of what happened to them, and proof that the problem
has been dealt with.</p>
<p>Look for a coldain dwarf ghost named Korrigan. He hangs around some huts with
a coldain dog named Icefang. Give Korrigan your Obsidian ring, and Icefang will
become agitated. Stay out of his way or he will aggro you. Icefang should
proceed to lead you to the orc huts by the dragon bridge. Four orc oracles will
spawn, and Poxbreath Yellowfang. Kill him and loot the note. Next, look for the
orc emissary by the Crystal Caverns exit by the Rygorr Fort. Look for an orc
emmisary and follow it, but dont kill it! Look for a coldain traitor named
Rodric. Kill him and loot his head. Return to Garadain the Note, the Head, and
your Obsidian ring to get the Mithril Coldain Insignia Ring.
<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF">Step 7: Dwarf Prisoner!<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p>Garadain now wants you to rescue Corbin Blackwell from the prison camp. Kill
the warden and give Corbin the key and your Mithril Ring. He gives the ring
back.</p>
<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

They are sowed
    and have high MR and tons of HP. The best way to kill the warden is to have
    a magician cast a range FB spell and back off. That way, only the warden
    will come and the guards will not aggro and run off or despawn.<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>Corbin will then head to Dobbin Crossaxe. You have to protect Corbin. Along
the way, 4 Rygorr Orcs and 4 Giants and Commander Bahrek will spawn.</p>
<p>Once Corbin reaches Dobbin, he will thank you for rescuing Corbin. Give
Dobbin your Mithril Ring and you will get a note. Give this note to Garadain for
your Adamantium Ring.</p>
<h4 align="center"><!--mstheme--><font face="Times New Roman, Times New Roman, Times" color="#3399FF">Step 8: The Rygorr Chief<!--mstheme--></font></h4>
<p>I'm not really sure about the last step. You have to kill the Rygorr Chief.
Be careful of the Orc Avengers that might spawn. They have *TONS* of HP, sow,
and are very HIGH mr.</p>
<p>In the end you get a 8ac 8 str 8mr ring with a 16point dmg shield.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you can request and stop before the last step and keep the
Adamantium ring on your other finger.</p>
