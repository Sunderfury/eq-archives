<p align="center">By: Islington Angelwatch</p>
<p><br>
Shin Greaves and Shin Gauntlets are very easy for paladins to obtain at early levels and give very nice protection. The Greaves have AC 10
equal to that of Bronze and have a bonus to your save vs. Disease +5.<br>
The Gauntlets have AC 7 equal to Baded and have a bonus to your save vs. Posion +7. Both pieces are No Drop (which means that you must loot
these items and cannot buy them from a vendor or another player). Both pieces are also found in Lower Guk.<br>
<br>
The biggest trick to getting these pieces or armor is to get them early on (level 10 - 20 is an ideal level in my mind). The reason for this is
because you need to cross through a dungeon that is not dangerous to you<br>
yet but could very well become so. Allow me to explain this strange occurrance in a bit.
</p>
<p>From Freeport East go South through the following zones. Northern Desert of Ro (N Ro), Oasis, Southern Desert of Ro (S Ro), and zone into
Innothule Swamp. Once you zone to the swamp, follow the zone wall west and then south until you come to a cave opening. This cave opening is
the entrance to Upper Guk. Be very careful because if you accidently pass the cave you might bump into some Trolls (they are pretty far from
the cave though). Enter the cave and make your way down to Lower Guk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically the best place to get the armor is what is referred to as Lower Guk dead side (it's the zone line with all of the corpses and
people waiting for groups).
</p>
<p>Now when passing through Upper Guk and Lower Guk, it is extremely important to know that you cannot kill anything or help anyone! This
also holds true while in the swamp. The main inhabitants of Guk are<br>
Frogloks and as a paladin, we do not start off Killed on Sight (KOS) to them. However, if you attack one and kill it or help someone kill one
(and this includes taunting, healing, rooting etc.), you will take a<br>
faction hit and become KOS to the frogs. With that being said, the trip is very easy and you can wander all over Upper Guk and explore at
leisure.</p>
<p>Once in Lower Guk you will want to stay near the zone line. In Lower Guk there is an added danger, undead frogs. These undead frogs will
attempt to kill you so do not go near them. The armor drops very near<br>
the zone border off of the following: Shin Gauntlets drop off of Shin Knights and Shin Greaves drop off of Shin Ghoul Knights. It helps to
let people at the zone border know your intentions and, hopefully, they<br>
will help you get the armor. People usually let the armor rot as it is useless to people hunting the zone for experience and loot.</p>
<p>There is one last warning that deserves it's own paragraph. If you hear someone shout "Train," don't think twice about it but just zone to Upper
Guk! The monsters here are very powerful and would like nothing more than to eat you so just zone out at the first sign of trouble.</p>
<p>All in all these pieces are very easy to get and will last you through many levels if you get them early. Good luck!&nbsp;
