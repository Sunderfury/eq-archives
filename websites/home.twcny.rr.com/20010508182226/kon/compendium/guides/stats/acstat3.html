ugh the worst is when tanks wear those plus 6 dex and agility rings instead of a nice 5 ac 55 hp or equivalent.<br>
<br>
Shamans can boost most stats by 50-67 at this point anyway.&nbsp;<br>

Greetings,<br>
<br>
As has been said at every single point in this conversation, any increase in AC over any stat is worth it. Yes I would recommend the extra three ac on the bark shield over the +9 str on the CDS. The only time I'd recommend stats over any AC is when the gain is better than what you give up. Runed Lava Pendant or necklace of
superority, you gain good resists and other stats for the loss of one ac over a steel collar. Now if you had a Polished Mithril Torc I'd change my story cause the three ac difference not to mention the stats already on the torc make it a much better item.<br>
<br>
As for a higher str increasing your average damage, yes it does, but in such a small amount it doesn't make much sense to take str over ac. For example if you had a str of 100 and your average damage was 7.0 points of damage a second and you increased your str to 180 your average damage would go up to roughly 7.1 or 7.2 damage a second. Hardly worth ditching 30-40 points of ac to get. Massive amounts of log parsing has proven this over and over again, its basicly indisputable.<br>
<br>
Lastly, if you aren't tanking then wear whatever you wish no one is hurt by it, but if you are tanking and don't wear your ac gear you only hurt your group and make your cleric heal more often. Do you really want to make the clerics work harder? They whine enough about healing paladins as it is=/<br>

Thank you Trueheart. Ive read posts basically identical to that 1000 times, and for some reason.. yours sunk in more
hehe. Although I try to keep my AC up, what you just wrote helps make my choice even that much more concrete. Awsome post man, keep up the work. I am copying this one. That is definately a keeper post.&nbsp;<br>

Whoever thinks stats ever beat AC honestly hasnt been playing long enough. AC matters over all. Except for helms. Those must be tyranixx crowns, frog crowns, fine silk turbans or savants caps. Whatever you can get with no pic will do. I have parsed it and people wearing buckets take more damage. Im not lying. Really.<br>

Thanks for all the info posted on this thread, some good stuff in here. I was going to start an equipment poll, but ran across this and all my prayers were answered I just hit 44th and am feeling woefully inadequate in several of the item slots, so now have a feeling as to what to shoot for in most cases. Thanks all!<br>

All of you speak as though you have grouped with me and know if I can tank or not, I can tank just as well as ANY of you with your 900+ AC, any day of the week twice on Sunday. How do you know if 900 AC is the magic number on a given mob, or 1200? How do you know 825 AC will not deflect a blow from 99% of the mobs in the game as 900 AC will? Where are your logs to prove that? If the warrior in your group has 1200 AC and you have 900 you are a joke by your own
admitions, you are NOT a tank up to his standards, and if AC is king you are a queen to that warrior,
lol.<br>
<br>
I DON'T have to tank as well as a warrior, I am not suppose to. However in most groups I have been in with a warrior I certainly hold my own, I get hit the SAME, I don't get healed more, more or less the same dmg taken as the warrior. You all claim that 240 str verses (fill in the absurd low amount) str is a paltry .1 dmg difference, that is just so laughable. If you guys can only do .1 more dmg with high str you suck, and the dude who asked if I have heard of stun, can you read? Go back and you will see I said I don't HAVE to use stun to motivate the mob to attack me like you do, my weapon ACTUALLY pisses them off. If AC is king and stats suck, just go ahead and ditch ALL Stat items regardless of any minor loss of AC, cause stats do NOTHING, but AC rules. You guys need not waste any plat on items, cause a steel mask and steel collar have high AC in there given spots, only the rarest of Kunark stuff can replace them if AC rules. If you don't have the HIGHEST AC item in EVERY single spot on your dude you are a laughable queen of a tank,
lol. Don't let me catch you AC freaks with Diamondine Earrings LOL you guys already proved str is totally useless so why recommend such a crappy earring verses a Golden Topaz Earring and Ivandyr's Hoop, don't settle for no sissy marry 2 AC each. And don't let me catch you with a Keran Toy, what a piece of junk compared to the latest and greatest thing to go in that spot,
lol. Every item you guys get is obsolete unless it has the absolute highest AC known to
eq, lol. If you have 1 AC less then ANYONE else on the server you are not a tank, you are a sissy marry.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
You cannot choose your kit, you must submit it to the Uber Paladins with no str Guild of Norrath for Approval, if they decline your application you MUST imediately sell every stat boosting item on your dude and forever bow to the followers of the AC deity,
lol.<br>
<br>
If you are ever in danger of being killed by a mob in eq, you lack the proper AC, you are NOT a tank you are a sissy marry, because obviously the AC freaks are so damned tough they never need a heal, the cleric kneels before them and beg them to stay and protect them with their incredible AC numbers that don't do squat but look good and make them feel a bit tougher then the next guy who is tanking just as well as them.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
LOL, I am not going to equip ONE item you nerds recomended, it is my frigging Paladin and I will equip any gol darn thing I feel like it, I will wear mesh armor if I frigging feel like it,
lol. If I want 240 str and hit as hard as I hit then that is my choice, I will still tank as well as ANY of you AC nuts, and I won't be the melee joke of the group you guys are. You nerds always quote these AC numbers, you probably have Heroism, Shield of Words, every little AC trinket you can spend a month each camping to get and still need a c heal, what a shock,
lol. Meanwhile I play for fun, I actually play it as a game, and I still tank as well or better then any of you ac nerds,
lol.&nbsp;<br>

as a matter of fact I DO wear a steel mask and collar. ok so I would upgrade to necklace of superiority or hangmans noose but I cant think of anything else Id wear instead...<br>

stun is pretty much a pallies raison d'etre, I am not in a damage competition with the warrior, I just stun the crap out of everything so a wiz can blow it up :-)<br>

Welcome back Alagarn. I see you posted such a thorough analysis on what STR does, and AC. I honestly don't care what you do with your paladin, you pay the cash. I do care thou about the people that group with you. If you would just take a minute and actually test yourself you'd see. But alas you won't.<br>
<br>
So many people thought the world was flat...&nbsp;<br>
...and so many people thought stats were all that.<br>
<br>
Sheesh Alagarn you come to this board, you do ask for advice, you do say you're going to check some of that out. Now all of a sudden you're god's gift to Norrath?<br>
<br>
And about being grouped with a warrior, yes we do need decent ac, why? because there are a lot of times where the cleric may be lom or oom and the warr is at 2 bubs of life? what then? should we just let the warrior die? Man you really do need to open your eyes. read throu this board, there's been alot of times people have stated "If grouped with a warrior let them tank, and pull out your best damage output weapon" - that's just fine &amp; dandy. Warriors are made to tank. But so are we, and I can taunt easily off alot of warriors, without even hitting taunt some days. what then? should I go by your standards and get my ass handed to me hopin my 240 str &amp; 640 ac will save me? Hell no!&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Get over yourself, man. It's not a personal flame, but I don't even see why you came here.<br>
<br>
"I want advice, but you're all wrong, I know everything I need to know"<br>
<br>
Glad I don't party with you Alagarn, cuz 100 ac means alot ALOT more than 100 str(15+ avg LESS dmg taken per hit vs 0.1 more dmg per second). But if you wanna be such a person to hug your stats and shun your ac, go for it. You came for advice, we gave it, explained it, you didn't like what you heard, so you're being quite rude.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
And yes I have grouped with you. For your sake I'll keep quiet about how EASY it is for you to drop. Sure you live with someone that plays a cleric - maybe that's why you never hear one complain, because you never group with a different one. If you do, hey, good. But I gurantee at LEAST one of them thinks you need better Gear. Just because Valorium shows doesnt mean you can take hits.<br>
<br>
BTW, come inspect me some day, see what Items I wear that sucks for ac, that I havent ditched stats for
(FBSS aside). I gurantee I can taunt off you NP and I use a 2h weapon, and I can very likely outlast you on a strict Player vs Mob situation.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Mr Sarcaasm, you asked, we delivered, you laughed and swore you were right. Tell me again why you came here?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
BTW I'm still awaiting you parses on AC &amp; STR. You said anyone with 240 ac that only gets .2 more dmg per second sucks, well, I guess everyone sucks (yes even you
Alagarn), because str doesn't change much of anything. It's cheaper to increase ac for a much better damage absorption than it is to increase str for very little change other than a new number in your hit range. Oh, not only is it low cost and more affordable, but statiscally there is a better increase with ac than output of
dmg.&nbsp;<br>

Re: An AC verses stats test<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Its very simple really.<br>
<br>
Why do rangers thing they are so horrible in the expansion. Its becuase their AC is so crappy.<br>
<br>
You cant read 2 posts on the rangers glade without some post complaining (and understandably so) about how low their AC is.<br>
<br>
Rangers are getting mauled in Kunark and by reducing your AC the same level as rangers, you are getting hit just as hard.<br>
<br>
No one can take a hit better than someone else if they have the same AC. So whether or not you "tank well" isnt a matter of opinion.<br>
<br>
Lastly, none of us really care what you do or what you wear. I think the reactions are mainly for the benefit of younder paladins on this board, so they dont get misplaced ideas.<br>

What started out as a nice rehash of the stats vs AC debate has completely degenerated.<br>
<br>
Alagarn, your comments are completely uncalled for.<br>
<br>
We've done the parsing. We KNOW what AC does. Have you done the same? When you have, and some support for your claims, THEN we'll continue this.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I'm damn proud of my 92 STR. Heck, I gave up my Hero Bracer to switch to Ro. The extra +5 save vs magic outweighs the -14 MR hit I take from the Silver Jacinth rings.<br>

I tried the AC vs stats test and I've been able to tank better than ever. I can take more hits when I taunt mobs off the warrior or when I'm the main tank. Also, now I stay behind whenever there's a train and tank all the mobs while my group runs to the zone, and I can still escape with 1 bub of health left. So if AC sucks so much, why has it saved my butt so many times? And you say, "Well, I just don't believe that." Well this is coming from someone who used to wear bp jewlery and mith bp before I got a sm bronze collar, jagged bands, and a
ebcp.&nbsp;<br>

I'll admit that, even fairly recently, I was a stat weenie. Str at 134 from 105, wis at 119 from 88, agi at 107 from 70 (didn't know squat about stats when I started ), etc. Then I thought I'd check into this "AC is king" stuff. Every stat item I lost made me wince. But, wonder of wonders, I noticed that as my AC slowly climbed and my stats dropped, I actually performed better.<br>
<br>
Now, at 39 (just hit 40 but can't really comment on it yet), self-buffed and using yaulp II, I can get my AC to 800. And boy does that make a difference.<br>
<br>
Been hanging out in solb a lot lately. Used to be that if I couldn't get into a group right away, I'd hang out at the zone, healing and buffing, maybe throwing a slash or two in to help someone get to the zone--but if I was smart, I zoned right behind them. But now, I hang out near the zone and solo kobolds. Not always successful, and am always grateful for that heal or slash or two someone throws MY way, but I can actually solo a greater kobold, without using
LOH. have only completely soloed two GK's (first time the noble ran by and smacked me in the head just as my opponent dropped, laying me out on top of him), but the fact is, I can do it.<br>
<br>
Why? Because I'm getting hit a lot less and getting hit for a lot less. My str is 112, my agi is 81 (some encumberance issues here, but I carry the +7
agi/dex necklace to help), wis is 94. I carry some wis/mana gear in case I need it, but I'm a much more effective tank than previously--due solely to my higher AC.<br>
<br>
In my final analysis, AC is king.<br>

Re: Personal experience<br>

OK simple words and math.<br>
<br>
Assuming your right and str does affext combat then you are MAYBE getting a 10% total increase in overall damage over the course of a battle. Assuming your fighting one mob.<br>
<br>
BUT if you have high ac, not only will you survive longer in battle, you will do more damage also as you are getting more SWINGS in combat. In addition if you have multiple mobs in combat pounding on you all the addditional mobs willbe doing less damage. Ergo you last longer. Ergo you kill mob one and turn to mob two instead of dying to mob one while mobs two and three help him kill you.<br>
<br>
Raising AC makes you last longer in any melee your in. And any melee your in for longer, is a melee your doing MORE damage in. I can categorically state since I take so little damage in combat I DO more damage and can Tank mobs longer. I can alos keep mobs OFF other weaker members becasue my AC is so high. Mob frensy on the Casters while you fighting? NP! Stun, taunt, damage and then turn back to main mob.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
"But I have 2 mobs on me now! I'll die!" No you won't Your ac is so high they can hardly hurt you.<br>
<br>
Last night I tanked 4 blue Lizard in the Cazic Thule Temple Top while the rest of my group killed the casters. I lost a sum total of 1.5 bubbles of health when they were able to help me out. If I had not been abke to DO that ALL The group would have died. The cleric was LOM as were the casters. I bought them time to selectively kill while I held off the main force.<br>

I did my share of damage to be sure. But THAT is what Paladin tanking is about. SAVING THE GROUP. If you and your group LIVE through a fight you did something right. Mathematic PROOF in parsed logs and personal experience too have proven that Higher AC makes a bigger difference in combat than ANY amount of stat increases.<br>
<br>
If you do 100 damage a swing for 20 swings in low AC before Death, but 75 damage for 40 swings in high ac before a death, who does more damage? The guy with more AC.<br>
<br>
Try it and I bet you will have more fun. And lose the attitude. It is unbecoming a human being let alone a Paladin Character.<br>

Re: An AC verses stats test<br>

Ah, data - can't beat having data. Thanks for posting that Trueheart. I wish I had all of the stuff I posted months back - it's terribly annoying when someone who "knows it all" arrives and disputes things we tested and tested and tested and tested....<br>

I forgot where this quote came from but it seem so applicable:<br>
"Okay...its your funeral"<br>
<br>
This reminds me of a doctor named Smith(seems like a lot of guys where named Smith back then ^_^) who lived in London during the 17th
century(IIRC). He noticed that during one outbreak of cholora that all of the people who got sick drank out of one well in that part of town. Centuries before germ theory was put forth, this guy had figured out what was causing this particular outbreak of the illness whether or not he understood the mechanism. For reasons beyond him, he saw people drank from the well and then get sick. That was enough proof for him. To fix the problem, he removed the well's pump handle. People stopped drinking the water and the cholora went away.<br>
<br>
You know what,Alagarn? No player out there knows what the Damage Dealing Formula really is. No player out there knows that the Damage Taking Formula is either. However we can setup semi-control situations and observe the results. We may not completely understand the mechanism that goes into dictating behavior in the game, but we can infer various things by watching the results.<br>
<br>
The results still stand and have been tested MULITPLE TIMES across every class that uses melee as their primary damage dealing mechanism. You put on stat gear and beat up a bunch of stuff and look at the results. You put on AC gear and beat up on the same bunch of stuff and look at the results. It really is quite conclusive. The amount of HPs you save(and consequently mana from the designated healer) is quite a lot. Unless you show any qualitative proof otherwise, you positiion is weak and you appear to just be stubborn.<br>
<br>
Alagarn seems to be from the school of "best defense is a good offense." Sacraficing your defenses for a boost in offsense is at best risky and at worse deadly. Remember Sun Tzu's quote:
&quot;Invinciblity lies in defense; A possiblity of victory lies in offense." If your defenses are so great that the enemy can't hurt you, then it doesn't matter how much offense you have...you'll win sooner or later. On the other hand, if you defenses are weak but your offense is powerful, then you expose your weak defenses every time you attack. The only way you can win is by being risky and agressive and attacking. What happens at the point you can no longer attack(ie stamina runs out, healer out of
mana, slowed, blind, stunned, etc.)?<br>
<br>
It is one thing to say "I don't care you guys say, I'm doing it this way!" Its something else to say we are stupid for taking a stance that you don't agree with. If you really don't believe that AC is what we say it is, wander over to the Warrior boards and ask the same question. They live and die by melee factors far more than Paladins. You'll get exactly the same response.<br>

"don't insult me"<br>
<br>
why do we see that quote from people who refuse to parse the data?<br>
<br>
The math seems fairly straight forward to me, your reaction seems a bit over the top.<br>
<br>
No one is trying to insult you. What seems to be alluding you is that MANY others did the research and what did they find? That increasing AC meant that they lived longer while increasing stats (like
str) had very little effect. So little as to reasonably be considered negligable.<br>
<br>
It's an interesting question about "is there an AC plateau? A point that there are diminishing returns..." I'd be interested in the answer. All the data I've seen suggests that is not the case, but I haven't seen any this topic, but my days of parsing data are over.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
At this point it appears that making a decision to wear a Brigadine Tunic &quot;cuz I like the cool color" is practically as valid as
&quot;cuz I need the strength."<br>
