<LI>February 2, 2000
<UL>
  <LI>Posted new version, v2.12.</LI>
  <LI>I've finally got enough time to fix a few bugs in EQP 2.11, the new version is now ready. I've other features planned to put into EQP but just need to find the time to code them.</LI>
  <LI>New feature added : Max/Min/Avg hit delay - in melee summary. This value will help you to determine the max/min/avg hit delay between swing of your weapons. However, since the time stamp in the log file only comes in seconds, the absolute minimum time delay will always be one second (0 second skipped as it could be double attack/dual wield hit).</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>October 30, 1999
<UL>
  <LI>Posted new version, v2.11.</LI>
  <LI>EQP 2.10 was finished a couple days ago, but I spent some time and give some thought about it. I was wondering, who are the people who really uses parsers? I figured, from the emails I got, that most of them are looking for some program to analyze their combat performance, so I've spent some extra time and produced a highly accurate and detailed page just for combat information.</LI>
  <LI>As a result I have decided to skip releasing 2.10 and release 2.11 later today.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>October 21, 1999
<UL>
  <LI>EQP 2.10 is almost ready, I believe I'll be posting it up by the end of this week, so stay tuned.</LI>
  <LI>As request by my girlfriend Judy, I've posted a few shots of friends in EQ, they are listed at the bottom of the page, check them out =)</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>September 28, 1999
<UL>
  <LI>I've already got many bugs fixed (thanks to all of you who send bug reports in), added few new stuff into EQP, and most important, I've checked many places (especially in summaries) to make sure EQP is as accurate as possible. While EQP may not be the fastest, I'm sure it offers the most features and best accuracy than any other log parsers available. I'm testing it right now, and a new version would be posted in a couple more days. Sorry for the long wait again =p</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>September 16, 1999
<UL>
  <LI>My internet connection at home is down, it won't be back up til next thursday so it may take a little while to get a new version posted. Sorry for the long wait folks.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>September 9, 1999
<UL>
  <LI>Still working on it, next maintainence version will be released this weekend.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>September 7, 1999
  <UL>
  <LI>Fixed a few bugs, adding a few more things. Next version will be out in a few days.</LI>
  <LI>I also want to thanks to the hundreds of you who send me emails with suggestions and bug reports, they are very helpful.</LI>
  <LI>Added a new section called <B>Known Issues</B>. Guys, <U>please read this section before sending me emails</U>, thanks!</LI>
  </UL>
</LI>
<LI>September 5, 1999
  <UL>
  <LI>As Promised, the new version have loaded with TONS of new features, check below for details.</LI>
  <LI>EQP is now 550k zipped and 1.3MB unzipped, sorry for doubling the size but it's packed with stuff in it.</LI>
  <LI>Posted new version, v2.00.</LI>
  </UL>
</LI>
<LI>September 3, 1999
  <UL>
  <LI>The next version of EQP will be v2.00, I've decided to skip v1.50 since there are just too much new stuff to be only 0.4 version up ;)</LI>
  <LI>Some of the new stuff including a second stage analysis, which allows you to analyze information into detail, GM logs, detail reports, and of course more regular statistical analysis as well etc.</LI>
  </UL>
</LI>
<LI>September 2, 1999
  <UL>
  <LI>Working on EQP v1.50, lots of new features coming soon.</LI>
  </UL>
</LI>
<LI>September 1, 1999
  <UL>
  <LI>Sorry for posting two version a day folks, but it's well worth the download. EQP is now 300 to 550% faster in parsing!</LI>

  <LI>EQP use to take 2-3 minutes to parse a 20000 lines log file, now it takes 53 seconds in normal mode, and 26 (!!) seconds in fast speed mode. (Note : Color parsing will be slower)</LI>

  <LI>Posted new version, v1.10.</LI>

  <LI>Tested and verified the result of EQP, it appears to be quite accurate. I tested EQP with the 4.8MB log file I got, then used TextPad 2.3 (Helios Software) to count the numbers in the same log file, and found the numbers reported by EQP is accurate. (eg. EQP reported 84 total spell fizzles and 375 interruption, while the other parser reported 65 and 296 respectively - same for most other statistics).</LI>

  <LI>Posted new version, v1.02.</LI>

  <LI>Woohoo, my page reached over 1400 hits per day! You guys rocks.</LI>
  </UL>
</LI>
<LI>August 31, 1999
  <UL>
  <LI>Posted new version, v1.01.</LI>

  <LI>Posted some new screenshots of EQP parsing the 4.8MB (67k lines) file. <A HREF="67k_1.jpg">1</A>, <A HREF="67k_2.jpg">2</A>, <A HREF="67k_3.jpg">3</A>, <A HREF="67k_4.jpg">4</A>, <A HREF="67k_5.jpg">5</A>.</LI>

<H3>Known issues : </H3>

<B>Please read this issues VERY carefully before you sending emails to me about bug reports (which are not really bugs), or complains.</B><BR><BR>
<UL>
<LI>If EQP stops after parsing line 1 of your log file, chances are you have used some editor to edit and save your log file, taking away the line feed and return from the end of each line. Just open the log in EQP, and save it once, then it will be fixed and ready to be parsed.</LI>
<LI>Since EQ logs everything you see when you play EQ, sometimes messages could get scrambled up and end up logging some garbage characters including "End of file" (EOF) character. If your log have such a character before the real end of file, EQP may stop before it completely parse the whole log, so just remove that line and parse again.</LI>
<LI>By default, EQP uses color parsing and normal speed mode, please change setting if you find that speed to be too slow for you. The fastest speed combination is non-color parsing and speed mode.</LI>
<LI>For best results, please kill a mob one at a time, that way the parser will be able to generate the most accurate result of your ability to kill mobs.</LI>
