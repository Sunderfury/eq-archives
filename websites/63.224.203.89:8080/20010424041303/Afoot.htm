			It seems that the changes made in the last patch were very benificial to us all, below are the latest changes made
			in the world we all adore.<BR>

			<BR>
			Bug Fixes:<BR>
			- Players levitating should be easier for other PCs to see.<BR>
			- When charmed/feared and killed players should not be returned to the<BR>
			character selection screen.<BR>
			- Lore items in containers that are dropped should not be destroyed.<BR>
			- Charged items, such as the Staff of the Observers, should correctly report<BR>
			the number of charges remaining after zoning.<BR>
			- Corpses should remain lootable even if a player goes linkdead while<BR>
			looting<BR>
			- A player under the effect of charm or fear can no longer open their<BR>
			spellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells.<BR>
			- A player using online help should no longer be locked into the help screen<BR>
			if another party initiates a trade.<BR>
			- Non-melee items equipped in weapon slots should no longer mutate if the pc<BR>
			is charmed.<BR>
			- Extremely large NPCs, ie Vox, should not suicide when stuck.<BR>
			<BR>
			New emotes:<BR>
			- Here is a list of new emotes that have been added to the game: agree,<BR>
			amaze, apologize, applaud, plead, bite, bleed, blink, blush, boggle, bonk,<BR>
			bored, brb, burp, bye, cackle, calm, clap, comfort, congratulate, cough,<BR>
			cringe, curious, dance, drool , duck, eye, gasp, giggle, glare, grin ,<BR>
			groan, grovel, happy, hungry, introduce, jk (just kidding) , kneel, lost,<BR>
			massage, moan, mourn , peer, point, ponder, puzzle, raise, ready, roar,<BR>
			salute, shiver, shrug, sigh, smirk, snarl, snicker, stare, tap, tease,<BR>
			thank, thirsty, veto, welcome, whine, whistle, yawn<BR>
			<BR>
			PVP Changes:<BR>
			- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more<BR>
			viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells<BR>
			cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would<BR>
			do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a<BR>
			20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon<BR>
			them.<BR>
			<BR>
			Spell Changes:<BR>
			- Levitate: All players may now cancel this effect.<BR>
			- Paralyzing Earth now Wizard and Necromancer useable.<BR>
			- The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields has been slightly reduced<BR>
			- Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky have been changed into higher level<BR>
			spells.<BR>
			- Succor: Ro (Druid) is now a level 39 spell (previously a typo as a level<BR>
			49 spell)<BR>
			- Curse of the Simple Mind (Enchanter) now lowers both Int AND Wis.<BR>
			- Selo`s Consonant Chain (Bard) should now work better.<BR>
			- Shadow Vortex (Necro) is more effective.<BR>
			- Screaming Terror is now an all or nothing save - this should stop the<BR>
			'train' problems that it was causing.<BR>
			- Gravity Flux will now research correctly for Wizards.<BR>
			- Lich and Bond of Death are now researchable for Necromancers - check your<BR>
			tomes.<BR>
			- The different types of Words of Collection and Words of Acquisition are<BR>
			now more easily identifiable.<BR>
			- Dead Man Walking (Necromancer) has been renamed Dead Man Floating<BR>
			- Ignite Bones (Necromancer) has had the movement component removed. This<BR>
			means that it will no longer break root and snare spells, and that it will<BR>
			now stack with the darkness line.<BR>
			- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.<BR>
			- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed - AoE spells will now effect<BR>
			more monsters.<BR>
			- Some Magician Summoned items are now lore items. Items that have turned<BR>
			lore have had other small benefits added to them.<BR>
			- Dance of the Fireflies (Druid) has been changed from Divination to<BR>
			Conjuration.<BR>
			- Rangers have gained the spell Dance of the Fireflies (level 15)<BR>
			- High Level Enchanter Illusion spells have had the remainder of their<BR>
			effects implemented.<BR>
			- Magi research components have been added to more monsters throughout the<BR>
			world.<BR>
			- There is a new pet command: /pet taunt and /pet notaunt. Pets default to<BR>
			/pet taunt<BR>
			- The Rods for the Ice Comet quests will now pop much more often.<BR>
			- Envenomed Breath (Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<BR>
			- Scourge (Necromancer and Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<BR>
			- Enchantment of Light and Enchantment of Brilliance (Enchanter) have been<BR>
			replaced by new enchantment spells. These spells have been added to a<BR>
			hidden vendor somewhere in the game.<BR>
			- New quests for Necromancers to research their pets have been added<BR>
			<BR>
			Pets:<BR>
			- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage<BR>
			- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better<BR>
			<BR>
			DoT Changes:<BR>
			- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT spell<BR>
			works.<BR>
			- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there is no<BR>
			change to how a DoT spell works.<BR>
			- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied (happens<BR>
			every few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it would have taken.<BR>
			- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased. If the monster<BR>
			moves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much damage from the<BR>
			DoT as it would before the patch. If the monster moves for less then 18<BR>
			seconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage then it would have done<BR>
			before the patch. If the monster moves more then 18 seconds during the<BR>
			fight, it will take less damage then it would have before the patch.<BR>

			It seem for those of us who are of the druid persussion that Geoffrey C. Zatkin has quelled the storm temporarily.
			I now we are all curious about what is to come of the Tree Folk, what ever the out come I am shore that live will
			move on in Norrath.<BR>
			<BR>
			Yewe Tre`oraiche Guild Master &lt;Clachan Brigh&gt; <BR>

			<BR>
			Some words from the Gods themselves.....<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			If you are getting this mail, it is because you e-mailed me concerning the recent modifications to DoT spells in
			reference to Kiting on the test server. I am sorry that you are getting a group reply, but there were too many
			e-mails to respond to each of you individually. I did want, however, for you all to at least get a response. <BR>
			<BR>
			DoT spells will most likely be changed with the next patch. I can not go in to detail about what they changes are
			yet - we are still testing and do not want to prematurely announce what we will do. <BR>
			<BR>
			Be assured that the changes will not eliminate Kiting, nor will they make DoT spells useless. For many people,
			the changes that we make will increase the power of your DoT spells. For those of you that kite, you will lose
			a bit of efficiency kiting. <BR>
			<BR>
			Kiting in its current state is bad for the game because it allows certain classes to take out creatures of levels
			that other classes have absolutely no chance of taking out. This kind of imbalance is not something that we want
			in EQ. <BR>
			<BR>
			The reason that we are putting these changes in now is that we finally heard a solution that we found acceptable
			AND that had minimal impact on the rest of the game. Most other suggestions involved getting rid of or limiting
			SoW (which would effect everybody) or getting rid of all movement spells together. Kiting in its most common form
			involves SoW and a DoT. Kiting can also be done with Snare and DD or a Bow, the Necromancer Darkness series, Journeyman
			boots and DD, Root Bombing, etc. Any time that you can move faster then your opponent, there is trouble (and you
			are doing some form of kiting). If we were going to completely fix kiting, we would have to take EVERY instance
			that let you move faster then a monster and fix it. That would have a huge impact on EQ - we do not want to do
			it. <BR>
			<BR>
			We have a change that has a much softer impact going in - look for our announcement about it soon. I think you
			will be pleasantly surprised about what we are doing - at least compared to what you probably think we are due
			to rampant rumors. <BR>
			<BR>
			As a side note, we played with different powers of DoT's and Kiting on the test server. People saw this and started
			posting. Now, just as a reminder, test is for testing. Thank you all for your prompt e-mails noticing that were
			we testing DoT spells. Please realize in the future that just because we are testing something on test does not
			mean that it will go live. <BR>
			<BR>
			As a side note, we think that we got most of the DoT bug fixed. This means that you will be able to use your DoT's
			in a party situation, making your class much more powerful (the Necro's should be very happy with this one). I
			have heard reports that there still may be a case where there is a bug - but it happens MUCH less frequently. If
			you experience this bug, please e-mail use a report of what spells you were using, what you were fighting, the
			classes in your party and the size of your party. Any info (the more specific the better) you can give us on this
			bug (if it exists) would be greatly appreciated. Please e-mail this to </FONT><A HREF="mailto: ggrobson@verant.com">ggrobson@verant.com</A><FONT
			COLOR="black">. This address is ONLY for bugs related to DoT spells. <BR>
			<BR>
			If you still have issues with this, please wait a week or two before e-mailing me. I have a backlog of e-mail that
			I want to get answered - e-mailing me later will ensure that I have more time to read what you send me. <BR>
			<BR>
			Have a good one, and feel free to repost this. <BR>
