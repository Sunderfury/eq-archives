<p align="left"><b><center>I. Articles of Constitution</center></b>
<br>
<b>
A) The purpose of the Guild is to facilitate member growth and also contribute
to the maturation process of the Bristlebane server as a whole. The name of the
Guild “Clachan Brigh” loosely translated from Gaelic means “strength
through growth”.<br>
<br>
B) It is the belief of the Guild that all Characters of evil alignment should be
tolerated, in that they might somehow be found to be an agent for good. Should
said evil character prove that this trust is misplaced, appropriate
reciprocating action may be taken by any guild member.<br>
<br>
C) It is the belief of the Guild that EverQuest is a role-playing game.
Role-play is encouraged from members.<br>
<br>
D) Guild membership is held to be a privilege, not a right. Membership may be
revoked through means described below.<br>
<br>
E) The assistance of the Guild is freely given, yet is not subject to demand.
This means that Clachan Brigh may go to the aid of other guilds or individuals
as members see fit, but Clachan Brigh is a sovereign entity with no fealty to
any other group or person.<br>
<br>
<center>II. Guild Membership</center><br>
A) The Guild is comprised strictly of honorable characters. We will only accept
for membership characters of similar type. [Note the difference between Player
(human being) and Character (virtual being)]. <br>
<br>
B) Any member who is found to participate in any activity which constitutes a
violation of the End-User License Agreement with Verant (this includes hacking,
lewd behavior, etc.) will be removed from the Guild immediately. Further, the
ex-member will be reported to Verant.<br>
<br>
C) Should any member in any way attempt to disrupt or discredit Clachan Brigh,
that player's membership may be brought up for review by any two members of the
Guild. A member under review may be removed from the Guild by unanimous vote of
the elected Officers. If the Officers cannot come to a unanimous agreement on
the matter (either all in favor or against continuing membership privileges),
the member will be placed on suspension until the next election period. At that
time, Clachan Brigh members will vote for new officers (see below) and the
decision on whether to retain or dismiss the suspended player will be remanded
to the membership as a whole. This vote is final. Review is not a trivial issue
and, as such, this matter should be very carefully considered before any member
suggests this to an Officer.<br>
<br>
D) Membership is not contractual, and any guild member can leave at any time.
Any prior member of Clachan Brigh, will be re-invited into the guild without
going through the Trial Membership Period. However, if any member leaves a
second time, that member will not be re-invited (except under special
circumstances, which require discussion with, and approval of the officers), as
this is a sign of a lack of commitment that we are looking for from our
membership.<br>
<br>
<center>III. Government</center><br>
A) Officers shall be elected by the guild membership thrice yearly. The three
positions are Guild Ambassador, Guild Captain, and Guild Web Master. Elections
shall function as such: Candidates for office are nominated by any member
(including themselves) prior to election. On the day of voting all members are
given a 72 hour period of time to cast their votes electronically. All members
have two votes which they use to endorse 2 of the members running. The three
members who receive the most votes are named Officers of the Guild and decide
between themselves who will act as Web Master, who as Captain, and who as
Ambassador.<br>
<br>
B) The three officers of the guild are collectively given totalitarian power
over all Clachan Brigh functions during their period in office. The three
officers are equal with no one holding more power then the other. New member
candidates need to earn the unanimous approval of the 3 officers before being
accepted for membership. Members who have in some fashion disgraced the guild
may be removed from the Guild by the unanimous vote of the officers. In short,
when members vote for Officers of Clachan Brigh, they are entrusting them
absolutely with the day-to-day functions of the Guild.<br>
<br>
C) In broad strokes: The Guild Ambassador is responsible for dealing with Verant
Interactive as Guild Master, electronic communication, and resolving member
disputes. The Captain is responsible for all Guild events, questing, and rescue
operations. The Web Master is responsible for the guild web page, guild roster
there and on the event calendar. All Officers are responsible for adding new
members that have been accepted. <br>
<br>
D) A candidate for new membership must fulfill all the requirements stated in
the Clachan Brigh Membership Requirements. The officers should make a effort to
make sure new members will fit well in the family, by hunting with them, talking
with them, and talking to others about them.<br>
<br>
<center>IV) Guild Activities and Functions</center><br>
<br>
A) The primary purpose of the Guild is to promote membership growth. EverQuest
is a level-based game and thus growth and increasing a character's level will,
in many ways, be one and the same. Growth may also mean encouraging member
excellence in the various crafts, especially blacksmithing, tailoring, and jewel craft.<br>
<br>
B) The membership of the guild is expected to hunt together with frequency. As
such, the Guild Captain will form organized hunts on a frequent basis. The Guild
Captain is encouraged to organize these hunts monthly. Characters of all levels
and abilities are highly encouraged to attend.<br>
<br>
C) As the Guild matures, membership increases (not merely in numbers but in
strength), and the wealth of the Guild grows, the Guild may sponsor hunts,
quests and tournaments for the benefit of all the players of Bristlebane. These
events may also be thematic events.<br>
<br>
D) Anything that Members consider “fun” and embodies a “good” character,
the Guild may do either as a group or individually. We do not tell our members
how to act. We respect our Members as adults and anticipate that any actions
taken will be appropriate. <br>
<br>
