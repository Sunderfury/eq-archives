    <td vAlign="top" width="25%">Clachan Brigh taken from the old Gaelic tongue
      translated literally means Group Power. In this single meaning is the
      essence of why our guild exists. We fostered this belief from before we
      became an entity on Bristlebane, we embody our purpose daily and will
      continue to drive our cause forward in the future.
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We are not a collection of persons whose goal is to become the largest
      guild on Norrath. Nor is our goal to have the most advanced characters.
      Our goal is to have the most fun. We recognize that it is a lot more fun
      to adventure with friends and to be successful than it is to go solo and
      die frequently. We intend to aggressively grow our characters by
      adventuring together so that the cause of good over evil may be
      successfully forwarded in Norrath.</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We intend to be a small but extremely powerful group. It is our vision
      that every member of the Guild know every other member well. We do not
      desire “dead weight” members. We do not intend to solicit mass
      membership or to encourage every new player we meet to join our guild. It
      is our intention to “speak so loudly with our actions” that people
      scarcely hear our words. Of course, what words they do hear from us should
      always be fair and just. We intend that when people see a group of Clachan
      Brigh that they think to themselves “there goes the tightest, best
      organized, most together group on Bristlebane they are also fair, just and
      noble.”</p>

      since this site was live and as always I need content. Stories, news, good
      information, and of course suggestions that will make this a better site.&nbsp;&nbsp;All
      of the sections below are words from Tristin.
      <p> I would ask
      that everyone go look at the members page to become familar with names you
      might not know.&nbsp; Also, send in a screenshot, bio, and birthdate,
      please, so everyone can learn more about you than just your name and
      class.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This section is generally for the latest changes in the game and new
      nifties that Verant has put together.&nbsp; Much pleased am I that Verant
      has given us the ability to manipulate the contents of bags in the bank.</p>
      <p><br>
      This section is reserved for encouraging words and thoughts from our&nbsp;
      current guild master... Tristin Windmaster.
      <p>&quot;Ok, so I am not good at encouraging words.&nbsp; I want to remind
      you all to go out amongst the Norrathians and have fun and don't die ..
      leave that to me. :)&quot;</p>
