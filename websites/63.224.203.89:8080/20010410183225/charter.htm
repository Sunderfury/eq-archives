			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">I. Articles of Constitution</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">A) The purpose of the Guild is to facilitate member growth
			and also contribute to the maturation process of the Bristlebane server as a whole. The name of the Guild “Clachan
			Brigh” literally means “strength through growth”.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">B) It is the belief of the Guild that all “Players” are equal
			and should be treated with respect and kindness at all times. We define a “Player” to be the person controlling,
			via mouse and keyboard, an in-game character.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">C) It is the belief of the Guild that all Characters of good
			alignment are to be helped and encouraged as much as reasonably possible. It is understood that many Characters,
			which may seem to be members of the noble races, may actually be Trolls in disguise. Any of these types will be
			duly noted by the Guild and will be treated as such.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">D) It is the belief of the Guild that all Characters of evil
			alignment should be tolerated, in that they might somehow be found to be an agent for good. Should said evil character
			prove that this trust is misplaced, appropriate reciprocating action may be taken by any guild member.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">E) It is the belief of the Guild that Everquest is a role-playing
			game. Role-play is encouraged and expected from members. However, the Guild does not want to put itself in the
			position of becoming role-play police. While non-roleplayers may not be allowed into the Guild, they will not in
			any other way be shunned by Clachan Brigh members.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">F) Guild membership is held to be a privilege, not a right.
			Membership may be revoked through means described below.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">G) The assistance of the Guild is freely given, yet is not
			subject to demand.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
			II. Guild Membership</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">A) Any Player who has a valid EQ account is welcome to apply
			for membership regardless of their race, creed, gender or any other personal preference. We will not discriminate
			against any person for any reason.</FONT></SPAN></P>
            <P><span style="font-size: 14pt"><font face="Arial">B) Additional characters
            are to be allowed in the guild, with a two character limit.&nbsp; If
            a player wishes to guild another character</font></span> <span style="font-size: 14pt"><font face="Arial">removal
            of one of the current characters is required.&nbsp; All additional
            characters are subject to Officer approval.</font></span></P>
			<P><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14pt">C</span></font><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">) The Guild is comprised strictly of honorable characters.
			We will only accept for membership characters of similar type. [Note: the difference between Player (human being)
			and Character (virtual being)]. The following class and races need not apply: Trolls, Ogres, Dark Elves, Necromancers.
			However, Rogues may apply with the understanding that the Guild leaders will be very interested in how they choose
			to apply their unique talents.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14pt">D</span></font><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">) Any member who is found to participate in any activity
			which constitutes a violation of the service agreement with Verant (this includes hacking, lewd behavior, etc.)
			will be removed from the Guild immediately. Further, the ex-member will be reported to
            Verant.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
            E) Should any member in any way attempt to disrupt or discredit Clachan Brigh, that player's membership may be
			brought up for review by any two members of the Guild. A member under review may be removed from the Guild by unanimous
			vote of the elected Officers. If the Officers cannot come to a unanimous agreement on the matter (either all in
			favor or against continuing membership privilages), the member will be placed on suspension until the next election
			period. At that time, Clachan Brigh members will vote for new officers (see below) and also on whether to retain
			or dismiss the suspended player. This vote is final. Review is not a trivial issue and, as such, this matter should
			be very carefully considered before any member suggests this to an Officer.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><font face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14pt">F</span></font><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">) Guild membership is comprised into 3 classes: Officers,
			Charter Members and Members. There is no difference between a Charter Member and a Member other than Charter Members
			are Members who are on the original Charter.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
			<BR>
			III. Government</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">A) Officers shall be elected by the guild membership on a
			quarterly basis. The three positions are Guild Master, Guild Captain, and Guild Treasurer. Elections shall function
			as such: Candidates for office are nominated by any member (including themselves) prior to election. On the day
			of voting all members are given a 24 hour period of time to cast their votes electronically. All members have two
			votes which they use to endorse 2 of the members running. The three members who receive the most votes are named
			Officers of the Guild and decide between themselves who will act as Treasurer, who as Captain and who as Master.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">B) The three officers of the guild are collectively given
			totalitarian power over all Clachan Brigh functions during their period in office. New member candidates need to
			earn the unanimous approval of the 3 officers before being accepted for membership. Members who have in some fashion
			disgraced the guild may be removed from the Guild by the unanimous vote of the officers. Officers may impose fees
			upon members to raise funds for whatever purpose they deem beneficial to the purposes of the Guild. In short, when
			members vote for Officers of Clachan Brigh, they are entrusting them absolutely with the day to day functions of
			the Guild.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
			C) In broad strokes: The Guild Master is responsible for dealing with Verant Interactive as GM, maintaining the
			Offical Clachan Brigh website ( ), electronic communication, Guild roster and resolving member disputes; The Captain
			is responsible for all Guild events, questing, and rescue operations; The Treasurer is responsible for guild holdings,
			collection, and dispersal.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">D) A candidate for new membership must fulfill all the requirments
			stated in the </FONT></SPAN><A HREF="Join.htm"><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">Clachan Brigh
			Membership Requirements</FONT></SPAN></A><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">. The Officers may set
			forth any tasks for the Candidate so that s/he may prove themself worthy to become a Clachan Brigh Member.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
			IV) Guild Activities and Functions</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">A) The primary purpose of the Guild is to promote membership
			growth. EverQuest is a level-based game and thus growth and increasing a character's level will, in many ways,
			be one and the same. Growth may also mean encouraging member excellence in the various crafts especially blacksmithing,
			tailoring, and jewel craft.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">B) The membership of the guild is expected to hunt together
			with great frequency. As such, the Guild Captain will form organized hunts on a frequent basis. Characters of all
			levels and abilities are highly encouraged to attend.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
			C) As the Guild matures, membership increases (not merely in numbers but in strength), and the wealth of the Guild
			grows, the Guild may sponsor hunts, quests and tournaments for the benefit of all the players of Bristlebane. These
			events may also be thematic events.</FONT></SPAN></P>
			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">D) The Guild Treasurer is empowered to collect pre-set Guild
			dues from each Clachan Brigh Member. The amount of the due, frequency collected, and dispersal critiria are detailed
			in </FONT></SPAN><A HREF="Newsletter.htm"><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">Clachan Brigh Newsletter</FONT></SPAN></A></P>

			<P><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">E) Anything that Members consider “fun” and embodies a “good”
			character, the Guild may do either as a group or individually. We do not tell our </FONT></SPAN><A HREF="Members.htm"><SPAN
			STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">Members</FONT></SPAN></A><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 14pt"><FONT FACE="Arial">
