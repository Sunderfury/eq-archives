        Brigh taken from the old Gaelic tongue translated literally means Group
        Power. In this single meaning is the essence of why our guild exists. We
        fostered this belief from before we became an entity on Bristlebane, we
        embody our purpose daily and will continue to drive our cause forward in
        the future.

        <p><img align="left" border="0" height="10" src="S13SmallButton.GIF" width="10">We
        are not a collection of persons whose goal is to become the largest
        guild on Norrath. Nor is our goal to have the most advanced characters.
        Our goal is to have the most fun. We recognize that it is a lot more fun
        to adventure with friends and to be successful than it is to go solo and
        die frequently. We intend to aggressively grow our characters by
        adventuring together so that the cause of good over evil may be
        successfully forwarded in Norrath.</p>

        <p><img align="left" border="0" height="10" src="S13SmallButton.GIF" width="10">We
        intend to be a small but extremely powerful group. It is our vision that
        every member of the Guild know every other member well. We do not desire
        “dead weight” members. We do not intend to solicit mass membership
        or to encourage every new player we meet to join our guild. It is our
        intention to “speak so loudly with our actions” that people scarcely
        hear our words. Of course, what words they do hear from us should always
        be fair and just. We intend that when people see a group of Clachan
        Brigh that they think to themselves “there goes the tightest, best
        organized, most together group on Bristelbane they are also fair, just
        and noble.”</p>

        Erdal Soulsaver and Eranya to Clachan Brigh!&nbsp; I would ask that everyone go
        look at the members page to become familar with names you might not know.&nbsp;
        Also, send in a screenshot, bio, and birthdate, please, so everyone can
        learn more about you than just your name and class.&nbsp;</p>

        her... quiet (for our guild) presence known. I have received numerous
        tells saying how wonderful she is.&nbsp; I quite agree. Welcome and
