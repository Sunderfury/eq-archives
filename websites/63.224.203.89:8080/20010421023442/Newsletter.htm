			<P><I><B>A note on things Military by Moos Alini, Capitan of Clachan Brigh...</B></I><BR>
			<BR>
			First, regarding the securing of unique quest items. <BR>
			<BR>
			After a discussion with the Officers of the Guild, I can state that we are in unanimous agreement that the policy
			of the Guild is that Guild funds will not be used in any way to equip individual members with unique items. So,
			do not ask us to ante up 500pp to buy you that Beholder Staff or loan you the 50pp you need to buy a SBH. It's
			not going to happen.<BR>
			<BR>
			However, the Guild does want to encourage and support members acquiring these type of items. How we will do this
			is as follows: a given member (we'll him Bob) wants a unique item (Axe of Whoopass). What Bob must do first is
			some research. Bob should find out where the Axe of Whoopass is to be located, on what critter, what other fights
			must be fought to win the item etc… Bob then sends me an e-mail (<A HREF="mailto: moosalini@hotmail.com">moosealini@hotmail.com</A>)
			requesting assistance obtaining this device; this e-mail should include the reason he desires this item and all
			he knows of it, including what times he would be available to get the item.<BR>
			<BR>
			Reasons that I may judge Bob's submission to be invalid include pure monetary or twinking value (eg - wants to
			acquire the item to turn around and sell it, or he wants it for his &quot;second character&quot;) or that the information
			provided is somehow lacking (eg - it's a cut &amp; paste from EQ'Lizer). I will reject the request and annotate
			my reasons for doing so.<BR>
			<BR>
			If, on the other hand, the request is found to be valid then I will set a time and day for a hunting party to be
			formed. Bob must plan on being a part of this party. We will not go fetch items for people who are so low a level
			that they dare not even be in a party acquiring the item. In a party we will then acquire this item if it is to
			be had.<BR>
			<BR>
			Second, regarding guild hunting parties.<BR>
			<BR>
			It is my intention to have weekly organized hunting parties. The days on which these events occur will vary somewhat
			from week to week. This is to accommodate peoples' varied schedules in the hope that if a member or potential recruit
			can't make one week's event then perhaps the scheduling the next week will be more accommodating. These events
			will occur on either Thursday evening, Friday evening, Saturday morning or Sunday afternoon, on a week by week
			basis.<BR>
			<BR>
			The location of these hunting parties will also be random. One week we may have a &quot;Clachan Brigh takes over
			Crushbone&quot; theme, the next &quot;Clachan Brigh has a mad drunk brawl in the Arena&quot; or whatnot.<BR>
			<BR>
			Some of the purposes of these events: First, this provides us an opportunity to have fun together. Second, these
			events give us the opportunity to make a strong showing in the zone on which they occur. Hence, giving other players
			an opportunity to see our guild as strong and resolute, perhaps even inspiring membership inquiries. Third, all
			persons considering applying for guild membership would be welcome. This gives us good opportunity to take the
			measure of a potential candidate and hopefully insight germane to membership concerns.<BR>
			<BR>
			It is not a requirement at this time of a guild member to participate in these events. However, it is highly encouraged
			and if you are unable to participate <I>ever</I> then it really raises the question of why are you in the guild
			in the first place?<BR>
			<BR>
			Third, the guild takes seriously the responsibility of helping members recover their corpses.<BR>
			<BR>
			This does not mean that members should overdose on stupid pills and go adventuring in the basement of Unrest at
			level 15 just because they wonder if the Hag Sisters really do have a torture chamber down there. (Trust me, they
			do.) Your corpse should be in a position that, with reasonable effort, a decently high level person or party should
			be able to help you retrieve it. Your corpse should not be in a place that only a party of 6 level 50s have a prayer
			of getting it. Having said that, if you need help with corpse recovery please say so through /guildsay or make
			arrangements with me through e-mail. I will always give corpse recovery missions top priority.<BR>
			<BR>
			Many regard,<BR>
			<BR>
			Moos<BR>
			Capitan and Drinking Champion of Clachan Brigh.<BR>

			<BR>
			<I><B>Monetary Matters and our Guild by Seliris, the keeper of the coin…</B></I></P>
			<P><BR>
			The time has come for our Officers to draw up some rules and regs to make us the well oiled machine we can be.
			I intend to speak to you of money, and how we can all benefit. Sit a bit, rest your bones and have a mead with
			me.<BR>
			Over time, we will be growing, both in numbers and in legend, but to do this we need some funds… a base to work
			off of per say. We have come up with a plan to do this, to fill our coffers, and to use this money to better us
			as a whole.<BR>
			<BR>
			Here are our thoughts….<BR>
			<BR>
			As you toil away and kill the many beasties that Norrath has poured out to stop you, you sell the trinkets, baubles,
			and crude weapons of your prey. This adds up.. and armour and weapons do not come cheap. We DO NOT ask a large
			sum of your money. All we ask is a tithe comparable to your level.</P>

			As you can see, this isn't blood we are asking for, just a few coins a day.<BR>
			<BR>
			Now for the questions and the answers:<BR>
			<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>What is this money going to be used for????</B><BR>
			<BR>
			We spoke of many things when we first started this thread, many of which were fledgling ideas.. and Tunare knows
			we are open to new ones… but here are a few.<BR>
			1. Low level tournaments and scavenger hunts. Cash prizes…<BR>
			2. Corpse re equipping.. (ONLY used if TOTAL corpse loss and cannot be retrieved by GM)<BR>
			3. Materials for our smiths/tailors/jewelers to create items FOR THE GUILD (ALL items MUST be pre approved. DO
			NOT buy 10 bars of gold and expect us to cash in on it without approval)<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>WE WILL NOT USE FUNDS FOR THE FOLLOWING:</B><BR>
			1. Any item that we cannot retrieve by a quest. We are strong, and if a party cant get it, then by Tunare, you
			don't need it yet.<BR>
			2. Equipment that you can easily save up and buy on yer own. (Yes, that LJ vest is spiffy, but save the cash and
			buy it, or ask for a loan from another player.)<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>Who do we pay this to?</B><BR>
			Seliris is often on and will be keeping a ledger of this. Feel free to pay for any and all chars you have in the
			guild, for as many weeks in advance as you like… I am very mobile, and am often running across the globe at any
			given moment.<BR>
			<BR>
			<B>What if I don't pay?</B><BR>
			Guild standing is partially dependant on this... if you do not follow the rules and be a team player, we really
			don't need you. This is for us as a whole... we look good... we grow... Clachan Brigh means &quot;Group Strength&quot;.</P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Dues are due weekly, or monthly if you so choose. Please pay. We can all benefit from this.</B></P>
