      working on 'Destiny' constantly complaint that there is not enough time to fit everything
      they want to do into such a short time. I have checked on their progress, and hey, I
      really don't know what these guys are complaining about. They have accomplished so much! </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">I visited the monastery they created. Wow! It looks
      exactly like the real thing! Being a lady, naturally, I could not enter the premise though
      I would really love to be able to enter the quaint and tranquil sacred ground, full of
      ancient teachings. From the gates, I watched the monks practising their martial arts. They
      are such a skilful bunch, each so talented and swift with their movements and weapons.
      While walking outside the garden, I chanced to meet a wise old man. He said he was the
      Abbot of this monastery. What a cute old man. He seemed to know many things, but I had to
      leave (Tee Hee... he kept reminding of me of my dad!) </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">The other place I visited was the dungeon.
      Uurrrgghhh... I still shudder when I think of that place. Such a gruesome place, dark and
      gloomy. Thank God there were no monsters in it or I would have run for my dear life!
      Although it was only the first few levels I visited, there was so much to see and do. Take
      the ancient city for example, I though I saw a ruined shopping mall somewhere there too
      ;-).. It's pretty awesome to see the sight of that ruined city inside an inactive volcano.
      </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">I asked the guys what else they could show me and
      they whisked me away to a HUGE ancient mansion atop a mountain. They said that this is
      where a grand martial arts competition would be... Hmm... Can't wait for it to happen..
      all those hunky guys flex their muscles. </font></p>

      <tr>
        <td><blockquote>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">This has been a busy week (but when are they
          not?).&nbsp; First, I'm sure you're wondering what/if I'll have anything to say about the
          rumors flying all over the net, specifically BitchX's latest claims about GT and Unreal
          2.&nbsp; And as you suspected, I can't say much.&nbsp; Let me tell you what I can say: <a href="http://www.gaminginsider.com/" target="_top">BitchX</a> made the assertion that GT
          had signed Legend to create Unreal 2.&nbsp; Mark Rein wrote in to correct him/her/it that,
          in fact, Epic had signed Legend to write said game, not GT. &nbsp; Given that in doing so,
          Mark has confirmed this rumor, the bag is catless.&nbsp; We have, in fact, signed a
          contract to produce the sequel to the amazing game Unreal.&nbsp; </font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">I can't say much more, and I certainly can't answer
          your questions--so please don't write me asking about it.&nbsp; I will give you my
          impression, however.&nbsp; Legend has gone through a transformation in the last couple of
          years.&nbsp; We always had smart and talented people--game designers, programmers,
          artists, etc.--but we applied them to rather unrewarding genres (commercially, at
          least).&nbsp; Now, we've changed our course. &nbsp; We've attacked the new frontier,
          combining our skills at creating content with cutting edge technology, and adding talented
          people to the pipeline.&nbsp; Although I keep touting our progress to you, I think this
          new deal is a clear indication of the behind-the-scenes reaction to what we've achieved
          with The Wheel of Time. Naturally, I'm very excited about the prospect of Unreal 2 coming
          from Legend, but I'm also excited about what this says about WoT and Legend in general.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Today is a milestone day, so this might be shorter
          than normal.&nbsp; We're delivering tons of maps, including a new multi-player prototype
          that screams (it's optimized for lower end machines), a set of Arena levels (these are
          tons of fun), and a couple of Shadar Logoth citadel variants.&nbsp; Also, we're delivering
          animation for the Minion, the Black Ajah Boss, the Warder, and the Whitecloak
          Archer.&nbsp; The level design team and Steve B. deserve a lot of credit for all of the
          effort they've put in to make this milestone happen.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">WoT's lead artist Paul Mock showed up today,
          computer in tow.&nbsp; He's set up in our conference room to help our new texture artist
          Marc Tetrault come up to speed. &nbsp; Although he doesn't have the sheaf of sketches for
          the White Tower primitives with him (his dog ate them), he has spent some time
          establishing the architectural feel to the place.&nbsp; This week, he should be able to
          pump out a few drawings so that the lds can start building the primitives.&nbsp; I'm
          really looking forward to seeing these.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Our AI dynamic duo (Ryan and Mike) are hard at
          work.&nbsp; Ryan is almost done laying down the basic architecture for a class of
          troop--to the point where they can actually start implementing specific cases.&nbsp;
          They've got their work cut out for them for the next milestone--including getting the
          Minion up and running.&nbsp; I really can't wait to see him do his thing (also included
          are the Trolloc, the Whitecloak Soldier, and the Warder).&nbsp; Aaron and Sam have spent a
          ton of time together testing and tweaking the Artifacts.&nbsp; Already Aaron has
          implemented some major improvements to their functionality that has made our
          &quot;testing&quot; sessions a lot more fun.&nbsp; These improvements are actually part of
          the multi-player prototype milestone deliverable. &nbsp; Thanks go to these guys for
          putting in some long hours making it happen.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Everything looks wonderful, but as we approach the
          release date for this game (yes, I know it's months away, but it seems like days), I'm
          becoming increasingly focused on making sure we have a polished product at the end.&nbsp;
          I'd rather have something a little smaller that's absolutely done right than something
          that could collapse under its own weight.&nbsp; Right now I'm in the process of figuring
          all of this out.&nbsp; It's making my head hurt.&nbsp; Maybe I'll just go play--ah,
          test--some more WoT. :-)</font></p>

      same engine as UVIII?<br>
      <br>
      No. Holding with Origin tradition, each new Ultima involves new technology. Every new
      numeral has a totally new engine (U7SI is not considered a new numeral). Ascension will
      feature a 3-D polygon-based engine with a movable point of view, or &quot;camera&quot;,
      that will allow the player to customize the viewpoint in the game to his/her liking.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#FF00FF">5.2.1 Will Ascension utilize
      3-D acceleration?<br>
      <br>
      U:A will definitely support 3D acceleration, but will no longer require it to run. Of
      course, not having a 3D accelerator means that the game will play much more slowly.<br>
      <br>
      5.2.2 Will Ascension be 3DFX native?<br>
      <br>
      Yes. Ascension is planned to be a 3DFX native program. However, other 3D chipsets will
      also be supported.</font></p>

      <p align="left"></i></b><font color="#FF00FF">on gang size: We chose a 5 person gang for
      its tactical value, polygon counts and the like were considered after the gang size was
      determined. A 5 person squad offers you enough flexiblity to try most, if not all, of the
      small unit tactics that have already been devised by militants the world over. It also
      allows you enough flexibility to create your own tactics and strategies. 5 people is also
      small enough that you don't just play the game you would Dark Reign or Warcraft. This is
      not an RTS and we wanted a gang size that would guarantee that it wasn't played that way. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on a comparison with Jagged Alliance 2: there really
      isn't a comparison between JA2 and Third World that's fair to either game. They have
      similiarities (small unit tactics, etc.) but they have too many differences to be
      considered in teh same genre. JA2, at least the demo, seems to be centered around combat.
      Third World shares the focus between adventuring with your gang and combat equally.</font></p>

      <p align="left"></i><font color="#FF00FF">The time is almost here! We have been working
      around the clock all weekend, and were going to release tonight, but the Press Release
      featuring the new name wasn't ready, so we have to wait. The reason we have to wait for
      the press release is because this version is such a drastic change from the previous
      version, that Interplay (and myself) want the new name on the game before it's made
      available to the public -- and to display common courtesy towards the media, we need to
      send out the press release before we post such a large change to the public. When the
      Press Release is done, the new 0.993b version will be posted, and the Mordor website will
      be updated. We're looking forward to getting the new version out to all of you! </font></p>

      I'm getting into some really cool stuff right now with client animation of models and it
      has made battle mode a LOT easier to manage. I've got in a bunch of different animations
      for status effects, and for different types of attack and with the exception of one little
      glitch (that appears to be fairly deep in the engine), it all looks great.</font></p>
