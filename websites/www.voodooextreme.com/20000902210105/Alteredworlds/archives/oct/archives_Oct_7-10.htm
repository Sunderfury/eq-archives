    toss-up between a new DVD drive or the Creative Labs Enviromental sound system. If anyone
    out there has the Creative Labs system could you give me a yell. I noticed that it has two
    cards that go in the PC and I only have room for one more slot and I need to use that for
    a cable modem. Also the new page desing is virtually finished....just waiting for Billy to
    get my E mail stuff back to me so I can add a few finishing touches to the page. Those I
    can't tell you about however. Keep an eye open though...you should see the new design very
    soon. -<a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com;sacrates@hargray.com"> Sacrates</a></small></font></p>

    <i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i><font color="#FF00FF">In a game like Shock 2, story is a critical
      concern. I've spent a good deal of time developing the storyline for the game, with the
      goals that it is (1) entertaining, (2) consistent and coherent with the first title and
      (3) an enhancement to the player's gaming experience. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Storyline is a fine line to walk in a computer game.
      I think the story in Shock 1 worked so well because it rarely _forced_ the player to sit
      there and watch it. The player picked up most of the story from interactive logs, and they
      could continue playing while they listened to these bits of narrative. The story didn't
      block the gameplay. I'm personally not a fan of games that force you along a story path at
      the expense of gameplay. Compare a Sierra style adventure to Shock... Sierra games are
      strictly linear... you follow a singular path, pre-specified by the designer from start to
      finish. Shock has certain pre-specced points you have to hit (the laser, etc.) but HOW you
      achieve this and WHAT you do in between is what counts. The story embellishes the
      gameplay, it does not dictate it. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">But, it is still quite important. I'm currently
      preparing an internal document for the development team that details the events between
      Shock 1 and 2. Many of these details won't actually be present in the game, but they will
      help inform the team of the game world they are working in. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">My background is in &quot;normal&quot; literature,
      screenplays, books, etc. (I was a dramatic writing major back in the day), so we've looked
      at many sci-fi and non-sci fi references in the development of the Shock storyline. The
      thing to remember, however, is we are an RPG and not a FMV or Sierra game. Therefore, the
      player has a lot of say in how the character develops. Hence, we're not so much as
      proscribing a charater as letting the game subscribe to the character the player develops.
      It's a challenging task...</font></p>

      <p align="left"></i><font color="#FF00FF">4 Stars, we are down to 4 stars. Which means
      that almost everything is in and working. One of those stars is the End Game Slide
      Sequence which is still waiting on some art, the entrance to the Military Base - also
      waiting on art, something else near the end game, and some damn Repair Robots that are
      getting stuck by locked doors. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Those are the big problems up on our White Board of
      Doom, however we still have tons of small bugs that are getting fixed quickly but still
      need to be fixed. We are also implementing some other things as art comes in - like the
      Special Random Encounters. So, this sounds like everything is being held up by the artists
      - but that's not really the case. Everybody has plenty to do, and is working umpteen hours
      a day on the game. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">We just had an emergency with one of the early
      movies in the game, where the voice file did not synch up right with the frames of the
      movie. So one of the artists is going to be spending the next 36 hours straight (I'm
      guessing) getting it re-rendered by Sunday morning. The movie will then get laid to tape,
      and the frames compressed into the movie format that we use. Our Audio Director will then
      do the soundtrack including the voice on Monday. A little later than I had hoped, but shit
      happens. :) </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">All the death touchups for the critters are done, so
      everybody has their bloody death right now. And the artists are now pretty much working on
      touchups and just making things look better. I want some new trees and bushes, but we'll
      see if we can get them done and in the game. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">People have been able to play the game pretty much
      flawlessly up until about the middle of the game, but there are still some design
      screw-ups (many of them my fault - ooops) towards the later part of the game that we are
      working on. Nothing serious we just are trying to make sure that people will be able to
      know where to go next if they are looking for the main plot. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Party Members are being kind of a pain in the ass
      and crashing the game right now. But all in all they are coming along pretty well, and
      they definitely add flavor to the game. Some of the partymembers have a lot to say, and
      they'll even give you their opinion of your other partymembers. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Oh yeah, a clarification on the language comment in
      my last update. We are not taking out language, like four letter words or things like
      that. What we toned down were things that were just really bad references and situational
      stuff that was really, really, really raw. I know you all still want to see this, but you
      gotta believe me when I say that we all have high tolerances and some of this stuff leaped
      way over those lines. So don't worry you will get plenty of raw language in the game. </font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF"><br>
      Q: You are in the gaming industry for 20 years now and you spent allt he time on Ultima.
      Are there any other projects, you would like to work on?<br>
      <br>
      A: Absolutly. I can tell you for sure that my next game won't be an Ultima, which doesn't
      mean, I'll give up this series. I've got ideas for 3 or 4 games - all in different genres,
      and I really want to publish them. One of them will become the next Richard-Garriott-game.<br>
      <br>
      Q: The problems with Ultima Ascension seem to grow. Quiet some many designers and
      producers have left the project, fans of the series are mouning about missing
      RPG-elements. Some even talk about &quot;sell-out&quot; and &quot;cash-cows&quot;<br>
      <br>
      A: I'm happy, that I - the creator and &quot;father&quot; of the series - am asked this,
      too. It's right, that some members have left the team. But you shouldn't forget, that
      those designers used the popularity of Ultima, to enhance their future plans.<br>
      <br>
      Q: I don't think, that Ed del Castillo, who created Command &amp; Conquer, does need such
      PR-acrobatics.<br>
      <br>
      A: We are all sad about Ed del Castillo leaving OSI. In this case, there were just
      &quot;philosophic&quot; differences. Ed did have some ideas about the game, that didn't
      fit to mine. That doesn't mean, his design was bad - it was good. It just wasn't
      compatible to me ideas about Ultima Ascension.<br>
      <br>
      Q: Who is now the leader of the project?<br>
      <br>
      A: Someone, who definitly will finish it: me!<br>
      <br>
      Q: With all the respect for Lord British: You didn't program any recent title for
      yourself. And we all know how fast old technologies go and new come. Diabolicly asked: are
      you still qualified after being absend for so long?<br>
      <br>
      A: If you mean, if I'm able to sit in front of a computer and design revolutional new
      code, the answer is: No. My job is to build a design-philosophy. Visual apperance,
      implementing of features and a story, that is just right for the Ultima-Universe, belongs
      to this. Ascension is a real Ultima-game, where continuity and genre-specific elements
      take care, that it earns this name. Cause we use new technology, there isn't any reason to
      think, that we drop old principals.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">1) There would be no value-added DVD features in the
      product. It would simply be the 5 Baldur's Gate CD's dumped on a DVD. The only value it
      would offer consumers would be the convenience of not having to swap CD's. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">2) The installed base of DVD machines is still low.
      If lucky, we would sell X units (removed for confidentiality reasons) of DVD product.
      Because of low quantities, our variable product costs would be high, especially if
      numerous production runs were required due to uncertainty around the numbers. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">3) Low retail excitement. Retailers are not planning
      to get fully behind DVD software titles until mid/late 1999. Most stores do not have DVD
      software sections. There are issues/costs associated with stocking, shipping and tracking
      two separate SKU's. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">4) Potential risk to ship dates. A DVD version would
      only make sense if released in conjunction with the CD version (else DVD owners would just
      buy the CD). An additional SKU would complication and possibly delay the release of the
      title. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Given minimal consumer benefit and high potential
      risks, I recommend we cancel any consideration of a DVD title for initial release. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">If no one has any issues, I will remove the DVD from
      the web site and post a short explanation of our rationale... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">In many ways this was a very tough decision to make.
      Though it will in no way impact the quality of Baldur's Gate, I know many of you own DVD
      drives and were hoping to use them with Baldur's Gate (I've been reading all of your
      posts). I hope you all understand where we are coming from on this. If you have any
      questions or comments, you can post them here or send me an email... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">On Monday we will post this news on the home page
      and remove the DVD reference.</font></p>

      <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff"><p align="left"><small>4 Stars, we are down to
      4 stars. Which means that almost everything is in and working. One of those stars is the
      End Game Slide Sequence which is still waiting on some art, the entrance to the Military
      Base - also waiting on art, something else near the end game, and some damn Repair Robots
      that are getting stuck by locked doors. </p>
      <p align="left">Those are the big problems up on our White Board of Doom, however we still
      have tons of small bugs that are getting fixed quickly but still need to be fixed. We are
      also implementing some other things as art comes in - like the Special Random Encounters.
      So, this sounds like everything is being held up by the artists - but that's not really
      the case. Everybody has plenty to do, and is working umpteen hours a day on the game. </p>
      <p align="left">We just had an emergency with one of the early movies in the game, where
      the voice file did not synch up right with the frames of the movie. So one of the artists
      is going to be spending the next 36 hours straight (I'm guessing) getting it re-rendered
      by Sunday morning. The movie will then get laid to tape, and the frames compressed into
      the movie format that we use. Our Audio Director will then do the soundtrack including the
      voice on Monday. A little later than I had hoped, but shit happens. :) </p>
      <p align="left">All the death touchups for the critters are done, so everybody has their
      bloody death right now. And the artists are now pretty much working on touchups and just
      making things look better. I want some new trees and bushes, but we'll see if we can get
      them done and in the game. </p>
      <p align="left">People have been able to play the game pretty much flawlessly up until
      about the middle of the game, but there are still some design screw-ups (many of them my
      fault - ooops) towards the later part of the game that we are working on. Nothing serious
      we just are trying to make sure that people will be able to know where to go next if they
      are looking for the main plot. </p>
      <p align="left">Party Members are being kind of a pain in the ass and crashing the game
      right now. But all in all they are coming along pretty well, and they definitely add
      flavor to the game. Some of the partymembers have a lot to say, and they'll even give you
      their opinion of your other partymembers. </p>
      <p align="left">Oh yeah, a clarification on the language comment in my last update. We are
      not taking out language, like four letter words or things like that. What we toned down
      were things that were just really bad references and situational stuff that was really,
      really, really raw. I know you all still want to see this, but you gotta believe me when I
      say that we all have high tolerances and some of this stuff leaped way over those lines.
      So don't worry you will get plenty of raw language in the game. </p>

      <br>
      Appearance: Mysterious, hidden features, mechanical arms, unkempt hair, piercing eyes.<br>
      <br>
      Traits: Bitter, cold, does not speak out, looks out for himself.<br>
      <br>
      Relationships: Despises authority, ex-patriot, hates his former country, follows no-one.<br>

      Ability: &quot;Green Beret&quot; type military training, agile, cat-like, deadly.<br>

      <br>
      Background: Araym was a carefree youth who didn't do so well in school. He joined the army
      at age 18 because no one else would have him. Trained as a Special Forces Unit with
      expertise in demolitions, Araym was eventually adopted into a covert military operation
      intended to weaken the opposition's hold. But what started as an underground operation
      turned into a secret war. Hundreds of Araym's comrades went down before his eyes. When the
      news broke, cover-ups and expulsions from the Cabinet ensued. Araym lost his arms in the
      line of duty and was captured by the enemy. After 4 months of hell, Araym returned home to
      find a country that didn't want him. Even his own family refused to acknowledge him. Alone
      and bitter, Araym fell in with the Bounty Hunters. Having been conditioned to the military
      for so long, turning to a life of combat was the only thing he could do, the only way to
      feel right. He hates his country for using him, for sending him to do their dirty work and
      then denying his existence, ignoring him as if he were the enemy itself. Bitter and cold,
      he has turned these emotions to his advantage in the bounty hunting business. Araym uses
      his new robotic arms in combat, and wears them as a badge to remind himself of the
      consequences of blindly following orders. </font></small></p>

      official word because we don't know yet. Since we are still waiting for some sounds and
      music, I can't give you an exact install size. It should be somewhere between 250 and 300
      MB for a minimum and 2.5 to 3 gigs for a maximun. When we get the rest of the resources in
      the game, there might be some extra space on all of the CDs. If that is true, we can
      reduce the min install by placing more redundant information on each CD. It does however
      look like a fairly tight fit since we have taken a lot of care to minimize the amount of
      CD swapping. As far as install options there are min, recommended and custom.</p>
      <p align="left">The recommended install is only about a 100 megs more than the min and
      includes everything but background graphics and movies.</p>
      <p align="left">The custom install lets you install as many of the remaining parts that
      you have the hard drive space for. The components are organized by CD so you install
      entire CDs to minimize swapping. I would recommend that you install the entire CD5. This
      contains, although just barely, the actual city of Baldur's Gate.</p>
      <p align="left">There are also some additional install configurations that are available
      but not directly supported by the install package. That is, you will have to make some
      manual changes to the ini file, but these will be documented in the readme.txt file.</p>
      <p align="left">If you don't have the drive space on one partition, you can copy the
      entire CD to another drive and have the game pretend that it is that particular CD. </p>
      <p align="left">If you have multiple CD drives, you can tell the game that you want CDs
      1,3,5 on one drive and 2,4 on another.</p>
      <p align="left">The same thing goes if you have a network setup, although we are finding
      our CD drives, faster than our network connections.</font></small></p>

    <p align="left"><small><font face="Tahoma">Second is a post called &quot;Avoiding the
    Daggerfall Syndrome&quot;, or more accurately, how to stop players from running from store
    to store shoplifting their way to riches.</font></small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">There is some random
      chance involved you will not ever be able to steal from stores that are way to hard for
      your current skill level, no matter how many times that you reload. Conversely, if your
      skill is much higher than the store difficulty. But don't worry, any store that has really
      good items, also has a very high difficulty.<br>
      <br>
      If you are caught and guards are summoned, there are several things you can do to avoid
      being summarily executed on the spot. <br>
      <br>
      First you can try hiding in shadows until the guards get bored and go away. This can be
      really nerve racking when they are searching all of the rooms for you. <br>
      <br>
      Second, you can try to fight them. This really isn't an option early in the game, but as
      you get better, and have more party members, this becomes an option. <br>
      <br>
      Thirdly, you can try to charm them. Ahh, the good old &quot;Charm Person&quot; spell.
      Although you had better run before it wears off and they become really pissed off at you. <br>
      <br>
      And lastly, you can try and bribe them. Depending on your party repution and charisma
      value, you can bribe the guards. Just remember that some guards won't be bribeable and if
      you bribe too much, your reputation will suffer. And, of course, if your reputation gets
      too bad, guards and bounty hunters will start looking for you. <br>
      <br>
      As far as the &quot;barrel-trick&quot;, you can't move the barrels, and some of the guards
      will be spell casters.</font></small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">NPCs make no choices
      regarding anything to do with advancement. Once they join the party, how they develop is
      up to you. BG will be about constructing an effective party, even though only one
      character is really &quot;yours.&quot; The only time an NPC is removed from your control
      is plot related events, or if they fight with other NPC party members, or if they disagree
      with how you lead (alignment conflicts). NPCs are yours to control, within the limits of
      their alignments. They recognize you as leader, and do as you dictate. <br>
      <br>
      Again, you can use any member of the party as you see fit. A thief that steals a town
      blind can do so, but such acts will effect your party reputation a bit. The reputation is
      not just how outsiders view you, but how the party views itself as well. (besides, in a
      world with divination spells, how does anyone get away with anything? :) As for any plots
      that involve singular characters, the experience for individual actions is always divided
      up between the party as a whole. <br>
      <br>
      I think you will find that having the auto-pause activated every round will be rather
      tedious. I find that it really disrupts the flow of the game. Usually, I play in
      real-time, with the auto-pause set to go on if a weapon breaks. That is not to say that I
      don't pause the game quite often. Once you have more than 2 members in your party and are
      fighting multiple or large opponents, pausing just becomes sound battle management. I just
      don't see a need in doing so every round though. Fighters retain the last target they were
      directed to attack, and if you have selected from one of our default behavior scripts,
      they will even switch targets once through with one, chase others down or switch to bows,
      or just wait and guard weaker members of the party. Clerics can be scripted to do the
      above, as well as automatically heal members that fall below a certain percentage of HP,
      and Mages can be directed to launch their spells and attack or just get the hell out of
      the way :) Thieves can automatically try to backstab, or be told to stay at range. There
      are more variations, especially with the spellcasters, but these are the basics. Again, I
      would not advise letting the scripts do everything, and taking control of every action is
      quite challenging and fun with a full party. Turn the AI off and have at 'er, but I still
      don't think you will need to pause every round on the round. Sometimes you'll need to
      pause MORE, often less. <br>
      <br>
      Oh, and yes, you will have to hit spacebar to unpause after autopause has kicked in. There
      is no way to judge when to automatically do this, as you can make infinite changes to your
      orders while paused. You aren't using up &quot;movement points&quot; or some such, as the
      game is still real-time. The characters will still only do the immediate action you have
      directed, but you can change your mind what that should be if you are still paused. <br>
      <br>
      Yes, you can transfer your main character from singleplayer into multiplayer. There is a
      handy little &quot;export&quot; button on his character sheet, which saves him to a
      separate file outside of your saved game. This will require a bit of suspension of
      disbelief though, as the HOST becomes the &quot;main character&quot; in multiplayer games.
      He can assign control of that character to whomever, but there is always just one
      character that the story is &quot;about.&quot; As for items, everything comes with you,
      though the host can restrict items, experience, or stats that enter the game.</font></small></p>

    Shamino) at certain points in the game has been removed because &quot;</font><font face="Tahoma">it seemed to weaken the player's emotional link with the Avatar&quot;. I
    can't wait to see what the game actually looks like when it's out - they seem to go
    through a major revamp of something twice a month :). - <a href="mailto:rbowmaster@shaw.wave.ca">Bowmeister</a> </font></small></p>

      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">on creating all six
      party members: You will miss sooo much by creating all the characters. First, your party
      of all created will all use the default voice files, and while there will be a couple to
      choose from, they are all intentionally generic. You can go to the trouble of creating
      more lively ones, but the characters will still be devoid of &quot;personality
      overrides&quot; and behaviors such as moral failures and berserk furies. Sure it might be
      more convenient to play with automatons that never question you, but what fun is there in
      that? Second, the NPCs interact with each other. Some will seem fine with each other at
      first, but slowly build up to outright fighting within the group. Others may take
      exception to how you lead and run out at inopportune moments, or try and stab you in the
      back. Inconvenient? yes, but lots of fun too! Basically, the NPCs are not just static
      quest-generating meatsacks that you pick up for no reason. They will change with the
      lineup, and as well each has a special ability or talent that only they can do. If you are
      going to play multiplayer, play with other players and experience their personalities. If
      you are going to play by yourself, get some NPCs for the same reason. Sure there are a few
      quests as well, but thay are just the gravy.</font></small></p>

    Peterson of Interplay's role playing division Black Isle over at the BG Backroom Board.
    Lots of detail on the game development process at BI. <a href="mailto:unitedrealms@MCIONE.com">MadBard</a></small></font></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><small><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#ff00ff">on how Black Isle works:
      I think the challenge we have is that there are many different types of RPGer's in the
      world, and we would like to be able to design games for most of them. Not everyone wants a
      200 hour game. Not everyone wants to pay for it OR wait for it (how long has Baldur's Gate
      been in development versus Fallout2?). Our approach is to design different games for
      different RPG audiences - which is a departure from other companies who try to design one
      game to please everyone, and end up disappointing everyone to some extent. As we design
      these games, we want people to clearly understand that they are different, and more
      importantly, HOW they are different. We all know game companies whose products start to
      feel very similar after a while. We are striving to make Fallout2, Baldur's Gate,
      Planescape:Torment, and all our other products very different games. If we hit on a
      combination or title that strikes a chord with fans, we plan on coming out with additional
      products in the same line until folks 'vote' with their dollars and tell us it's time to
      move on... What this means is that if Baldur's Gate is successful, plan on a lot of
      Baldur's Gate products that are all 100% loyal to what Baldur's Gate is all about... One
      of the major commitments Interplay has made in the recent year has been to totally
      reorganize around product genres which is a fancy way of saying 'let the RPGer's work on
      nothing but RPG's.&quot; Black Isle Studios was created to totally focus on RPG's - to the
      total exclusion of everything else. Everyone who works here is every bit as much of a PRG
      gamer as you are (hard to believe). Our necks are on the line to prove to Interplay that
      we know what we're doing. The reason why I hang out on these bulletin boards as much as I
      do is because you are the people that will make it happen for us... so it pays to listen.
      So we are NOT trying to water down RPG's or something evil or sinister. We are trying to
      come up with a good mix of products that people give us 5 stars for -- while letting each
      product be very different from the other. I think we take a lot of heat for the corporate
      'profit motive' when in fact I think a focus on profits is a good thing. When we hit a
      product dead-on in terms of designing something that everyone goes nuts over, we get the
      signal loud and clear &quot;do more stuff like this!&quot; One thing that hopefully you
      will give us credit for (as least for as long as Black Isle has been around). We don't
      design the product one way, and try to sell it another. We are being very careful to let
      people know that Planescape is NOT another Baldur's Gate -- and I guarantee you that there
      will be many that think it is better (even with 40 hours of gameplay to play through to
      the finish once (and even WE don't know how long it will REALLY take - the game isn't even
      close to being done yet...)). on being different vs trying to please everyone: I hear you
      about the interviews. I have read them all. It is a tough line we walk - we want people to
      clearly hear how we feel the game will be different, but we don't want to put one game
      &quot;up&quot; by putting another game (or gamers) &quot;down&quot;. For example, we had
      an interesting discussion on my first day here at Black Isle. I didn't like the Fallout2
      ad. To me, it didn't say anything about what the game stood for or how it was different.
      It was too cluttered. So I asked people &quot;how would you describe this game to your
      friends?'' The response was &quot;Fallout2 is the RPG for big boys&quot; so then we spent
      time trying to figure out an intriguing way to say that. In the end, Krys Card, our PR
      manager, came up with the line &quot;A Classic RPG (minus the faeries, spells and other
      crap)&quot; which we thought really captured the feel and 'attitude' of Fallout2. So we
      ran with it. The point is, I like spells. Everyone likes spells. Half the time we talk
      about BG or Planescape we are focusing on how cool the spells will be. But there are no
      spells in Fallout2 -- it is not that type of game. We were not intending to belittle all
      the classic RPGers, or the spellcasters (god forbid - I generally play one) but we thought
      it was an important point to show how Fallout2 is a different KIND of RPG experience. Two
      things I try to avoid 1) Knocking the competition. Diablo II is going to be a great game.
      I can't wait for it to come out. I am going to buy it and play it and hope that it is
      awesome. Diablo II is NOT Baldur's Gate though. I want our games to be so good that they
      become the standard by which all other games are judged. Even now people are saying things
      like &quot;it is a lot like Fallout, only...&quot; I try to keep game comparisons within
      Black Isle. &quot;It is like BG, but more internal development focused&quot; for example.
      2) Talking about ourselves. (Which is what I've been doing on this post, but you guys
      asked for it). I am not happy with our current BG ad - the one that says &quot;The Most
      Anticipated RPG of the Year&quot;. To me that is marketing fluffery. It tells me nothing
      about the game or why we should buy other than &quot;MY, we're cool...&quot; It is one
      thing if we have actual reviews to quote - that is helpful for gamers to know who is
      saying what. But for BG we should be saying something like &quot;The ultimate AD&amp;D
      experience as never before seen on a PC&quot; which is how I describe BG to my core gaming
      buddies (we need to figure a cooler way to say this though). Expect a new ad soon...
      Finally, back to the interviews. It is very difficult to do these - trust me. You have to
      sound like you're chatting and that you're not reading from a script, while at the same
      time not making some sort of verbal slip that is immediately quoted all over the world
      like &quot;halflings suck&quot;. These guys are software designers, not news anchors.
      Imagine some of your friends if they were dropped in front of a microphone and asked to
      pontificate on a game they were really proud of... after the fact they'd probably read the
      transcript and say &quot;when did I say THAT!&quot; Think of it less as a corporate
      spokesperson that is speaking from &quot;on high&quot;, and more like a friend and you'll
      probably smile a little more. If one of your friends said something that you thought was
      out of line or simply wrong you'd say &quot;dude! You're totally off-base!&quot; and that
      would be the beginning of an interesting (and fun) exchange. So keep it in perspective.
      (Of course, I can't necessarily explain Chris Avellone's aversion to halflings &amp;
      elves... we all have friends that have personal 'biases'. I think he feels that they are
      overused to the point of being... well, uninteresting... It is a point of considerable
      kidding here at Black Isle) </font></small></p>
