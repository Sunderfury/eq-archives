      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">You are correct, though, in realizing that current
      game characters would have unfair balancing. Any multiplayer test will involve skill on
      the part of the player--whether the skill is deathmatch dexterity or tactical cleverness. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">A true coop RPG will probably be Anox 2. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">You won't be able to artificially pump your
      characters, but you will be able to take advantage of certain combinations of things if
      you are clever. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Artist Lee Dotson on the combat system: Combat at
      present is turn based with timed rounds similar to that of ff7. So there is some pacing to

    Shock info flowing like a monkey with bowl problems. Only difference is that they don't
    spray the news all over the walls. Read this fat little update. - <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a></small></font></p>
    <i><b><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></b></i><font color="#FF00FF">on game levels: We've honored that System
      Shock tradition, for better than worse. The game is broken into levels (actually, decks),
      however, the world is persistent and you may freely move between decks. You can drop an
      ammo clip on deck one, come back hours later and it will still be there... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on 3D hardware discouraging multi-function displays
      and multiple windows: Yes, what you say about 3D hardware is true, but MFDs are so
      critical to Shock's RPG gameplay that we bit the bullet and made it work. Like Shock 1,
      there's plenty of cyber gadgets to play with. One of our core goals, however, was to make
      sure the interface for using them was simpler and more intuitive. In other words, you can
      do the same cool stuff, but without the complicated interface... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on crouching, ducking, leaning sideways, etc.: It
      wouldn't be Shock 2 without them... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on outdoor terrain: Not currently planned. We really
      wanted to focus our energies on a game that gave that great System Shock sci-fi horror
      vibe and the indoors suited that better. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on models and animation: Polygonal motion captured. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on multi-player: Can't say much about multiplayer
      now except that we are working on it. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on control configuration: The Dark engine is
      intended to have keyboard remapping and therefore, so will we. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">There certainly was a philosophical predeliction at
      LG against such things before, but I think that feeling has changed somewhat. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">I think you'll be pleased with the system we've come
      up with mouselook/cursor control. Let me just say, we've got the best of both worlds (more
      on this later). </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on whether the RPG elements will be similar to
      Ultima Underworld: It will be rather serious to Underworld, actually, in terms of the RPG
      elements. There will be character generation (your &quot;character class&quot; is based on
      which branch of the military you enter) and character development (stats, skills, traits,
      the whole magilla)... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">In many ways Shock 2 is sort of Shock meets
      Underworld in a hot 3D engine... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on requiring a 3D accelerator card: Yes, this is
      true. We felt this was the only way to really take advantage of the 3d hardware out there.
      By the time of our release date, 3D hardware will simply be a reality. Currently, there
      are sites on the web you can get a 3dfx card for 50 bucks! Any gamer should have one... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on the interface compared to Descent Freespace and
      X-Wing vs Tie-Fighter: Our interface is somewhere in between the two, perhaps closer to
      freepace... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on time limits: Time limits are a tricky thing to
      pull off right, esp. in a game like Shock where exploration is so important. We don't want
      people whipping through the levels, because they'll miss so much re: miniquests, story,
      content, and general coolness. So, I don't think (though not saying for sure) we'll have
      much in this area... </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on re-spawning: Foes won't respawn per se, but we
      will have a wandering monster ecology...the system will determine (based on designer
      specs) how crowded with monstery-goodness a level should be and try to keep it that way
      (with some randomness). Of course the player himself can impact this (e.g. hacking the
      security system to shut down respawning). </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on AI and the security system: We will be using
      Thief's AI system. Security cameras behave differently in Shock 2 than Shock 1. Can't say
      much, but their behavior is far more direct now. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on the voices for Shock 2: Currently, no plans to
      cast the &quot;Talking Moose&quot; in Shock 2 (if you know what I'm talking about, then
      you know what I'm talking about... However, Teri Brosius will be back as Shodan, though
      she's asking her usual 20 million dollar fee. But we didn't bat an eye, we must have the
      real SHODAN!</font></p>

    <b><i><blockquote>
      <p align="left"></i></b><font color="#FF00FF">on a suggestion to remove the experience
      cap: The main problem with your scenario is that it is only applicable in single-player.
      Since you can export a character to a multi-player game and play through again, if there
      were no cap you would continue gaining experience with no benefit. Warriors are reasonably
      easy to implement as far as plain stat growth, but what about the other characters and the
      stats/skills/spells they could not get? This would also present problems when you
      installed the mission packs and sequels. They will be designed with a reasonable starting
      level in mind. It throws everything out of whack if your character is already 14th level
      in a scenario made for levels 8-14 (or whatever it turns out to be). </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">Basically, the cap encompasses your suggestion
      (because you will have to do pretty much everything to hit the cap!) and solves the above
      problems as well. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">The main reason why the game is capped where it is
      is because it is designed for characters of levels one through 6/7. We are following
      traditional AD&amp;D rules as best we can, and that means paying attention to the changes
      that characters undergo as they reach higher levels. If you are unfamiliar with AD&amp;D,
      character development in the game is not all straight stat advancement. Once level 10
      hits, most classes have special abilities or perks from then on, and we are planning on
      addressing them as best we can. No ignoring important character elements that make
      AD&amp;D characters what they are. Of course these will take resources and planning that
      we simply could not incorporate into BG in the time allotted. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on alignment shifts and loss of Paladin or Ranger
      status during the game: As it stands, alignment change is possible. Basically, if you
      chose a good alignment at character creation and you run around doing evil things, your
      alignment will shift downward eventually. You'll have to do a LOT of unmistakably evil
      things, but it could happen. As well, if you coose evil alignment at creation and are the
      consumate goody two-shoes, your alignment can shift upwards eventually. If you are
      neutral, you pretty much stay the same. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">The loss of paladin or Ranger abilities WILL occur a
      long time before your actual alignment shifts. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on what happens to fallen Paladins and Rangers: 1.
      they become pseudo-fighters that can't grandmaster. Other than that they progress as
      fighters from then on. I believe their character sheet says &quot;Fallen Paladin&quot; or
      &quot;Fallen Ranger&quot; so the disgrace is plainly evident. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">2. warning? Nope, though you will not lose your
      status killing people that have obviously wronged you (like stealing from you). The things
      that are evil will seem so from the start. You'll have made the conscious decision to be
      bad. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">3. no voluntary change of alignment(aside from a
      killing spree, that is). </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">4. Can you regain lost paladin or ranger status? Not
      in the first BG. We'll be addressing that more closely in BG2, where it will be a major
      event in the character's development. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FF00FF">on not using Chapter 1 as the interactive demo: This
      is the reason that an interactive demo has to be a stand alone story, and not a cropped
      version of the game. &quot;Chapter one&quot; is not a limited area, or a strict story arc.
      It ends when you arrive at a certain location, and this is marked as a milestone for your
      character, but where you go before arriving there can span a hell of a lot of space. The
      story is pretty much imbedded in the areas as well, so to take sensitive stuff out would
      be just as much of pain as making all new triggers and content for one area or so.</font></p>
