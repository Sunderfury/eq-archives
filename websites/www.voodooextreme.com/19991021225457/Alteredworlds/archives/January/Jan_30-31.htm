    <small>Abashi was again back on the boards keeping us all informed and enlightened in the
    ways of Everquest. This time he talks a bit on good and evil in Everquest. Seems <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>everyone is being philisophical today</strong></font>. </small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Norrath is a completely new world
      with its own vast history and virtually limitless diversity. The common phrase &quot;Good
      kills evil, evil kills everyone&quot; has no place in Norrath, as the concepts of good and
      evil are in the eyes of the beholder. We use the terms good and evil in their generic
      sense from the standpoint of a good human. However, in Norrath, dark elves do not beleive
      they are evil, they are oppressed and fighting back. Ogres and Trolls don't believe they
      are evil, they just know that the humans, dwarves, and elfkin try to kill them on sight,
      and also make a mighty fine stew. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Human Paladins certainly believe
      the Dark elves, ogres, and trolls are evil, but those races likewise think the Human
      Paladins are evil. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I realize this concept may be
      difficult for some people to understand, as most books are told from the standpoint of
      someone who is &quot;good&quot;. I have also read many books told from the standpoint of
      someone &quot;evil&quot; who thought all those who we think of as &quot;good&quot; were
      evil. Both types of books can be very convincing. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">But back on the concept of
      Norrath, Norrath is a land where it is taboo to kill your own. One can certainly take that
      path if you like, as a Dark elf who slaughters their dark bretheren, but don't expect to
      be welcomed back into the bousom of Neriak if you do. Though the possibilities are
      limitless, do not expect that by becoming a random killer you will end up liked anywhere.
      In fact, should you wish to play the role of an indiscriminant, expect to be treated like
      one by all you meet. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">I hope I've clarified the
      Norrathian situation to you. I'm sure if you think about it long enough, you will see that
      this format allows for infinite possibilities. You can play that human Paladin gone bad,
      or that Dark Elf who is really a magically altered High elf. You can play that Ogre who
      thinks dwarves are soft and cuddly, and you can play that halfling who for some reason
      just cannot stand wood elves.</font></small></p>

    <small>I was hanging around Everchat yesterday before the new patch went up when none
    other than Brad came on board. Of course I had to dish out a few questions to him. Looks
    like the Halfling Pimp Class won't be showing up until Everquest 14. (So he's saying
    there's hope!) I also found out that Horses will probably not make it into Everquest
    before or after release. Although maybe I could start a petition to bring around
    Ostriches. And even if they couldn't feasibly use Ostriches <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>we
    always have Dwarves</strong></font>?! &quot;Hey you Dwarf, don't run away I just want to
    mount you and ride you like the Steed you are.&quot;. Then of course, what are Brad's
    Plans beyond Everquest and a possible sequal? Well there's always massive multiplayer
    Pong! As you can see this discussion was quite productive and enlightening. At least we
    know one things certain, right now Everquest is going to rock your world with or without
    mountable Dwarves!</small></p>

    4 and PvP info</strong></font></a> <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com"><small>-
    Sacrates</small></a><br>
    <small>Here's a bit of info from Abashi regarding what is going to happen when we go from
    Phase 3.5 to 4. Also some news <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>on the PvP server</strong></font>
    also.</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Current testers will have the
      opportunity to register one character for restoration prior to the start of phase 4. This
      will allow them to retain their levels and receive a small reimbursement in the way of
      gold for the continued testing of mid and higher level zones. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">However, they will not be able to
      get their characters restored on the &quot;PvP Only&quot; server in Phase4. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">Additionally, though the ability
      to move a character between servers will be in for final, and possibly the middle of
      phase4, no one will ever be able to move a character TO a &quot;PvP Only&quot; server.
      Whether they will be able to move it FROM (retaining PvP setting) is still being decided. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The reason they will not be
      allowed to move TO a PvP server is out of a matter of fairness. One of the issues stated
      by PvP server advocates is that they didn't like the idea that someone would be able to
      build a character up and then go PvP. This philosophy is being embraced for the P4 PvP
      server, and will be kept into final should a PvP server be financially viable. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">If you wish to adventure on a PvP
      server, you must build the character there starting at level 1.</font></small></p>

      <i><p></i><small><font color="#8080C0" face="Bookman Old Style">The game is a strong
      mixture of role-playing (RPG) and certain tactical-style &quot;strategy&quot; games;
      RPGers familiar with Fallout or strategy gamers who've played X-COM or Jagged Alliance
      should all feel comfortable with the basic structure of the game. On the RPG side you've
      got the story and character elements. Aside from Sullivan himself you may add up to three
      other characters to your party as you move through the city. Despite the physical danger
      posed by over 40 different, err, &quot;entities&quot; (we don't want to give too much
      away, but we can say that it sounds like Sullivan will leave the aliens to the X Files
      crew), all is not combat. Character development will play a big part in the game, as will
      character/NPC interactions. To add to the tension, that which you would normally fight may
      instead be an unlikely ally, while those you assume to be friends could turn out to be
      your deadliest enemies. Expect to encounter many flip-flops like this in the game;
      Monolith won't go into specifics but it sounds like you won't be able to figure out the
      game's ending until you actually reach it. </font></small></p>

            for me to do? Kick in some Baldur's Gate damnit! Everquest is incredibly addicting yes,
            Tribes also has that same quality. BG does the same in all respects. All I know is that
            these 3 games alone will keep my gaming needs filled to the brim for some time to come.
            Before Christmas I was incredibly hyped for this stuff to come and now that it's here all
