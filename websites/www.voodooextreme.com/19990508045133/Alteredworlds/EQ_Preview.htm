    </strong><small>by: <a href="mailto:sacrates@voodooextreme.com">Sacrates</a></small></em></p>
    <p align="left"><small>This game is horrible!!</small></p>
    <p align="left"><small>Now that i've gotten your attention let me explain why this game is
    so horrible. If your a Crack dealer read this article, you've got a new Drug to deal out.
    If you read magazines like Cat Fancy often then you don't want to read this article. If
    you play computer games often then it's time to sit up in your chair, perk up your ears
    and read on. If you have any form of Heart disease, high blood pressure, or often have
    spastic convulsions when you get too excited you may not want to read this either. Just a
    warning.</small><br>
    <small>Before I recieved my copy of Beta 3, I had absorbed every piece of information on
    this game as possible. I dreamed the dreams that everyone else dreams about before they
    get a game (Not always about naked big breasted female elves) they've never played before.
    Usually in these cases we end up underwhelmed when we finally get the game. So here I am
    after finally downloading the client on my PC just sitting there staring at the Icon on my
    desktop wondering what lay beyond it. Little did I know.....</small><br>
    <small>With all that out of the way lets start looking at what makes EQ tick. I sign on
    and have a Character made up within minutes. You enter the world for your first time
    thinking things like UO etc only to get bitch slapped back to reality and realizing this
    is not UO. After my first 2 days of testing out the Wizard class I quickly decide that it
    isn't what i'm looking for. Why, after only 2 days have I deduced this you may wonder?
    Well, like all the other articles have stated, Everquest is extremely intuitive to use and
    navigate in. Therefore easier to get accustomed to with what you want to do.</small><br>
    <small>This game is all about you. It gives you the opportunity to do and be all you can
    be. (No, i've never been in the Army) The Races and Classes are EXTREMELY well balanced
    therefore you choose what you would want to choose not out of necessity but out of
    personal preference. In UO we were forced to powergame at times just to stay alive. In EQ
    this is not the case. You choose the Class or Race not because it has inherent advantages
    over other Race/Classes but because it fits your style of play.</small><br>
    <small>So here I am, not wanting to use the Wizard anymore so I switch over to the Cleric
    which is what I am looking for. A fairly defensive class that uses mostly assistance
    spells and defensive spells, yet can wear armor and use pretty good weapons. I am a High
    Elf, so must start out in the city of Felwithe located in the Greater Faydark. Faydark,
    like the name implies is very dark, foggy, wet, and nasty, (Please don't read between the
    lines with that analogy, I know what your thinking you perv!) but hey, I'm an Elf so I
    call it home.</small><br>
    <small>To address a few concerns I have recently noticed on the boards etc. First starting
    out with the repetition or monotony of simply killing Rats and Bats to make money.
    Personally I think the lower levels are just as much and maybe even more fun than the
    higher levels. Now admittedly i'm not exactly high level yet but am strong enough to
    handle my own in a battle against the weak creatures. You automatically know when you've
    graduated from one creature to another. You can almost feel your character become stronger
    and more powerfull as he/she gains levels. Believe me, gaining levels is a slow process
    also. </small><br>
    <small>There is nothing boring or monotonous about this game. And that leads me back to my
    original statement. This game is horrible. You can't stop playing once you start. Your
    first experience won't be earth shattering, but when you wake up the next day and play
    another session you realize something. You can't stop thinking about the game. Even when I
    am off playing Tennis or doing something else my mind is still on EQ and what I can do and
    what I will do next. </small><br>
    <small>Personally I don't like to be overwhelmed with a game at first anymore because I
    know it will lose it's luster down the road. Half life and Unreal are good examples of
    this. Half Life is a brilliant example of making a good game but didn't have
    replayability. Unreal was Purdy to look at in the beginning but later you think, been
    there done that. With a game like EQ you aren't completely overwhelmed with the graphics
    at first. Not until you actually start exploring then things become all too clear. You
    want to see more, you want to meet more people and creatures.</small><br>
    <small>Basically you do what the programmers want you to do. Socialize and be in a world
    that is massive in size. And Adventure, which is why this game is so horrible. You want to
    keep on going and see new sites and be in big epic Fantastical battles. <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>This game is so horrible because it is so good! </strong></font>That
    is the great secret the guys at 989 have been hiding so long. Ahem...sorry got a little
    sidetracked there, they don't call me Sacrates (With an A) for nothing! </small><br>
    <small>The graphics are, like I said earlier, not earth shattering until you start
    exploring. Then things start getting impressive. To actually see the front of my home in
    Felwithe you'd understand. It's a massive Medevil castle. Seeing the sunset in the
    Steamfront Mountains (Home of the Gnomes) is literally breathtaking. Seeing Akanon (Again
    home of the Gnomes) your first time is pretty crazy. A very dark, underground place with
    mechanized spiders and Gnomes walking around. I also watched as they maliciously killed a
    Half Elf that had gotten too close to their city. Obviously they don't like Half Elves for
    some reason.</small><br>
    <small>I cover a lot of games here at AW, but to this point nothing comes even close to
    what this game does for me. I've seen the glory of Baldur's Gate, i've played hours and
    hours of Diablo, and have been addicted to UO once upon a time. But those experiences just
    don't come close to this. It actually &quot;feels&quot; like a real world. And all you
    want to do is explore it. Keep checking our news section and i'll keep you updated on it's
    progress. I'll see you all in Beta 4 hopefully! </small><br>
