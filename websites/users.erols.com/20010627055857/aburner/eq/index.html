Some folks on the Gnome Message Board on EQStratics wanted to see pics of Gnomes In Action(tm).  So here are my pics!<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ruatha01.html">Picture #1</a> - Here's me fooling around with a big ol' smelly ogre! 
<li><a href="ruatha02.html">Picture #2</a> - Here I am perched precariously on the pointy part of a pedestal in one of the fountains in the Unrest courtyard. 
<li><a href="ruatha03.html">Picture #3</a> - That big pile of snow suuure looks familiar! 
<li><a href="ruatha08.html">Picture #4</a> - Here I am showing off my bronze armor.  This was taken JUST after I'd bought the breastplate. 
<li><a href="ruatha04.html">Picture #5</a> - Hey!  What's that over there? 
<li><a href="ruatha05.html">Picture #6</a> - Here I am modeling the leather armor for female gnomes.  Note how it looks a LOT like a pair of pajamas with footies. 
<li><a href="ruatha06.html">Picture #7</a> - Woo!  What an array of feminine beauty! 
<li><a href="ruatha07.html">Picture #8</a> - You'll just have to imagine the keen "Six Million Dollar Man" F/X here... 
<li><a href="ruatha09.html">Picture #9</a> - Me and a halfling druid take on a mammoth! 
<li><a href="ruatha10.html">Picture #10</a> - Here I am making friends with the Inky guards! 
<li><a href="ruatha11.html">Picture #11</a> - Here I am making friends with a giant skeleton in the Rathe Mountains! 
<li><a href="ruatha12.html">Picture #12</a> - Here's me and my friend Dakagar after we'd just dispatched TWO Cyclopes.  (Okay, so we had a little help from Draekil the Druid and Raniella the Cleric.  But still!) 
<li><a href="ruatha13.html">Picture #13</a> - Dak and I go at another Cyclops.  Draekil the Puppy...er...Druid is in the background keeping us both healed up!
<li><a href="ruatha14.html">Picture #14</a> - This was taken JUST after I'd spent 819pp and traded an Avenger Axe to get my Crafted BP, the last piece of Crafted Armor I needed.  I'd been trying for a couple of months to get the Crafted BP, and FINALLY I had it!  WooHoo!  Note the signature 2-handed sideswipe we gnome females use for our 2-handed slashing weapons.
<li><a href="ruatha16.html">Picture #15</a> - And this is a picture of me taken exactly one week after I'd bought my Crafted BP.  I spent 2 months real time trying to get a Crafted BP, I wore it for exactly a week, and then someone made me an offer I couldn't refuse on an Enamelled Black BP.  SAVOR THE IRONY!
<li><a href="ruatha18.html">Picture #16</a> - FLASHBACK!  Here's a pic of me as a young Gemchopper (fresh from getting my last name!) meeting with another female Gemchopper, my friend Srenye.
<li><a href="ruatha19.html">Picture #17</a> - Here's me in my low 30s (still with the bronze BP) with Hatsumomo, a fellow Gemchopper.
<li><a href="ruatha20.html">Picture #18</a> - Gnomes are the only race in Norrath that cannot be shrunk by the Shaman <i>Shrink</i> spell or potion.  There's a reason for this, as my Barbarian warrior buddy Hilorm demonstrates in this picture.
<li><a href="ruatha21.html">Picture #19</a> - This is a NEET shot, in my opinion.  This is the (cleared out) front of Mistmoore Castle.  This was taken during our first (and only, and eventually fatal and aborted) attempt to make it to the Kitchen via the brute force method of just fighting our way to the area.  Shortly after this picture was taken, two of my group members lay dead in the front entrance hall of the Castle, and I was standing dazed and confused in the Druid circle in East Karana.  It was very shortly after this incident that we adopted the "sneak in invisible" method of reaching the Kitchen.
<li><a href="ruatha23.html">Picture #20</a> - This is me immediately after getting my first Wakky.  The toothpick in my offhand is a Dragoon Dirk.
<li><a href="ruatha24.html">Picture #21</a> - This is me immediately after getting my second Wakky.  All I need now is a haste sash and you can call me Little Miss Whirling Blades of Death(tm)!
<li><a href="soulfire.html">Picture #22</a> - This is my good friend and guildmate Ibamn Greyfalcon, shortly after he became the first Erudite Paladin on the Brell Serilis server to obtain the coveted Soulfire!  WTG Ib!
<li><a href="ruatha25.html">Picture #23</a> - A gnome's-eye view of a Kunark rhino!
<li><a href="ruatha26.html">Picture #24</a> - I'm not sure WHAT this is, aside from RILLY BIG!  I think it's a globe of Norrath's moon.  There's another one that looks like the Sun, maybe.  And still another one that looks like Norrath itself.
<li><a href="ruatha27.html">Picture #25</a> - Cue John Phillip Sousa march music!
<li><a href="ruatha28.html">Picture #26</a> - Looking out of a cave into the jungle known as Trakanon's Teeth!
<li><a href="ruatha29.html">Picture #27</a> - Here I am, about to get my butt kicked by a flower!  <I>&lt;Feel free to insert jokes about Triffids, "flower power," and so on here&gt;</I>
<li><a href="ruatha30.html">Picture #28</a> - A skorpikis.  I <I>used</i> to not be KOS to these critters.  Alas...
<li><a href="ruatha31.html">Picture #29</a> - Everybody should take the time to stop and smell the flowers!
<li><a href="ruatha32.html">Picture #30</a> - My view as I run levitated over the snow-covered mountains of the Dreadlands at dawn.
<li><a href="ruatha33.html">Picture #31</a> - Another view of the Dreadlands mountains.  I'm the little floating speck in the middle.
<li><a href="ruatha34.html">Picture #32</a> - Yet <I>another</I> view of me flying through the mountains.  Once again, I play the part of Speck In Middle Of Picture(tm).
<li><a href="ruatha35.html">Picture #33</a> - Woo!  Check my AGI and my encumberance in this shot!  Man, that ore weighs a TON!
