<center><h3>This was taken JUST after I'd spent 819pp and traded an Avenger Axe to get my Crafted BP, the last piece of Crafted Armor I needed.  I'd been trying for a couple of months to get the Crafted BP, and FINALLY I had it!  WooHoo!  Note the signature 2-handed sideswipe we gnome females use for our 2-handed slashing weapons.</h3></center>
