              <textarea name='comment' cols='80' rows='18' class=textarea>No one should have to give up their gem that they also need to other people in my opinion.
I spent 2 months non stop trying to get gems that I needed untill I could'nt handle it anymore, theres no way I would give up 
my gems that I worked so hard for so I have to do it all over again, but as a result of how 
my luck was with having my gems that I needed drop I have quite a few caster melee gems, same should go with a caster or melee 
farming they're gems as they'd get gems they don't need but other people do in the process, thats how I think it should be done.
Anyway Lilwars as I said I have a few melee gems go check my reply to badas post on quests gems and see if I have what you need.
