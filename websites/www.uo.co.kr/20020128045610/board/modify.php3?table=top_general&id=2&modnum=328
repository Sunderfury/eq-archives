After Velious came out, I was still going to Fear ( I started just before epics came out) trying so hard to get my armour as everyone said thats what you need to do besides levelling 
to go to any fun big raids. So I tried my hardest to build up on my seniority but it was hard, no guilds in my timezone would let me go on there raids and EC was'nt strong enough so 
I had to rely on American lead raids  which meant I could only go on the weekends except I could occasionly go during my daytime during holidays. I had finally built up my seniority 
and started getting peices untill towards the end those fear leaders had left and I had to go on raids with same people but different leaders. Anyway there was alot of bad loot decisions 
(like verm tunics going to ppl on their first raids etc..) and some very pathetic breaks which lost me alot of experience so evntually I got sick of it all getting me down and decided to work on my Thurg quest armour instead.

I spent about 2 months soloing wyverns and suits day and night non stop trying to get my quest gems, in the process I got alot of gems I did'nt need and so eventhough I could sell them for 1k each as 
I desperatly need money as I wish to buy some resist jewellry as my poison/magic suck and I have no items in bank of any value I decided to collect these gems for my current guild at the time Emerald Crest, 
hell I'd still like to help some of these people, during that time I got 2 extra gems that I needed and promptly gave them to Garrath for 2 reasons 1 because he was my partner and 2 because he can't solo as efficently 
like other classes that needed it can and suits were impossible for him to solo. After 2 months I was sick of soloing in the same place day in day out, it was'nt any fun and I had'nt had any fun in the game for 
an awfully long time so despite the fact I had'nt quite got everything I needed I decided to have an extended break from it as soloing all the time was driving me crazy.

There was'nt many ppl in EC to fight with in my evenings, Forthyr and Ggak were busy with eurasia and stuff which I could'nt do as I just did'nt have the resists required on top of the fact I was just another druid, and 
It would take me hours to try and get in a seb pick up group which ain't fun.
During my daytime I have RL stuff to do at the same time so I could'nt join any raids etc.. due to my frequent extended afk's, so all I could do was solo and I was sick of it, then just about everyone in EC left,  
most times I was the only one online. Members had the option to join Uprising due to Trenqil but I was'nt interested in an uber guild I liked Emerald Crest but unfortunately there was no one around to have fun with,  
So eventually through Garrath's persuasion I left and joined TOP.

Garrath managed to persuade me to join you guys because of the fact that all the guys we'd met had been extremely nice and all your raids were 'fun', you guys did'nt seem like a big Uber guild although you guys are 
so efficient people would think you were, you guys seemed similar to the 'Family' that EC had except there was lots of you guys in my time zone so I joined.

Shortly after, I found there was a slight hitch, all you guys were aiming at totally opposite factions that I were and I did'nt want to keep soloing all the time so I had to make a decision on three options 1 leave
and find a guild on the same faction path as me 2 solo or 3 change factions after a while of watching you guys have fun in guildsay I decided to change my faction and started to join you guys on your fun raids,
When ToV raids started I was hoping to get some sow boots and get other peices later on, I never realised how often this leather would drop and how little leather classes would attend so was amazed at how quickly 
I was building up peices. Now when I get my faction up with giants I can complete 4 sets not because I was greedy but because I PUT THE TIME IN despite the fact I was'nt having fun to get those gems I needed previousely. 

I heard that ToP were collecting gems for there members so I had to make a decision  to either keep those gems I did'nt need for the ppl I'd had already collected them for a while ago who wer'nt actively persuing 
there armour quests yet or offer them to ToP for those classes that could'nt solo as effiently who were my current guild members and were actively persuing there quests. So I chose to help out ToP.

I thought that I was doing a nice thing but it seems to be coming out right here that thats still not enough, I assumed if everyone contributed there would be enough for everyone but it seems I'm expected to hand in 
everything and expected to spend another 2 or so months soloing day and night to collect my gems again if I'm allowed to even keep them, when I already have to go back to collect the ones I'm missing. 
Well I'm sorry but I don't want to go through that all over again I play this game for fun and would like to get the soloing I have left to do for faction and my missing gems out of the way. 
If that makes me a bad greedy person then just tell me and I'll promptly leave, I'm not or never have been a loot whore and will not stay in a guild if thats what everyone thinks, this is a game I play it to have fun.

Anyway I want to know what people think because this is bothering me and I would like to get it resolved one way or another.
