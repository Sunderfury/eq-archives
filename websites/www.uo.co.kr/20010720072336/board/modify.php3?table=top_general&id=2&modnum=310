              <textarea name='comment' cols='80' rows='18' class=textarea>Like to add my two cents here.  We need a better way of dealing with people outside the guild with these armor drops.  I was stunned that there were open randoms on a chain peice that included two new rogues who have never attended ANY ToP raid to my knowledge yesterday (also take into account I allready had this piece (boots) so I was not upset about my take in the chain loot matters).  I have to say this is plainly wrong and against what I feel would be fair in my opinion.

A old time Tunare necro said once "seniority sucks but it sucks the least" and I totally agree with that sentiment.  A rough points draft system tracking non guild member attendance would be easier to maintain and would work well with Fox's list.

Finally is the armor list to be a trickle down effect ?  So if the top person does not need it drops down to the next and so on ?  I would have to say that this seems to just promote not going to the raids till the people above you get their armor.  On the flip side of this issue those that get their armor really have no insentive to help others get it theirs.  I am not saying this is what I would do but there has to be some insentive for everyone on these raids.

Please anwser my question above.</textarea>
