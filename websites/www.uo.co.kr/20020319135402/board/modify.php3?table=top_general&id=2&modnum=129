***** the following message writen by a awful english people, and it is meaningless for some/most people, read at your own risk!  lol =P *****


It's been ages since i quit EQ ... and i'm happy that i still see most of the old people are still here.

the time i quit is because something bad happened in EQ made me unhappy and at the period when i was playing .... people like me can't survive in there.
well, what kind ?? suck ? nice ? mofo ? or a nice sucking mofo ?? hehe ... u decide =P

and this time when i came back, weeeeewooohooo, its much better than before...
people ain't care much about items, i mean other player i met in game, and u guys are way more powerful than before, the old ToP i knew was a powerful crew already, coz they play together in cafe, their power is came from their well co-operation and experienced in success / fail in old raid that done by themself before, and then, ToP drag GoN's people alone and goto raid somewhere, all raid are doing pretty cool and WE all had much fun about that. i think i forgot to say thank you for that part and i mustsay it here and now =P

just saw some of the old GoN member's gifs, that gave me alot of memories too lol

i missed Hephaes that lead us monkey to run around =P
and the funny Magician Mars =P

fox ...  seems changed a little than before (ask me in game if u like) ... but i just want 1 thing that .. cut the "~" word at the end of sentence pls ... i hated that snake thing that comes out everytime when u say something (~_~), and ... still observing about fox =P

TC ... i donno why all the people think that u r the "best bard" on tunare ??
just because u r the first one that hit level60 ? that u have most of the song that npc drops ?? i really wanted to know .... but 1 thing i'm pretty sure there are many difference between you and me how to play a bard ...  anyway, i didn't seen u play bard since i back lol, so i cant tell the answer atm =P

ToP's member ... darn, missed u guys but ... u guys gave me a different feeling than before .... strange.

ok cya guys in game! lol.
