but in response to your post I will say the following:

You may have a lot of gems to complete many of your quests. However without the guilds help you will never be able to complete the BP.  the other gems you have are not rare.

All I am saying is spread the wealth and wait for more to come..Rather then having someone that has not completed ANY quest wait to have to finish even one. Not like we would abandon you when you have helped others already.. 

BTW, If you needed resist gear why didnt you ask? We are a guild, not a bunch of individuals running around.. I know a particular necro that has some resist gear that isn't used currently.. Maybe need to ask him :P</textarea>
