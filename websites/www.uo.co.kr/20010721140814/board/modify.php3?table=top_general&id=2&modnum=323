              <textarea name='comment' cols='80' rows='18' class=textarea>I misunderstood Skyfox's system in my post - it is a cascading system, like a stack of champagne glasses... the glass at the top gets filled and when it overflows it flows down into glasses below them.  It's not a chain where you circle around so everyone gets one piece of loot before it swings back to you.

There are potentially problems with the champagne system - one is if you are on the bottom of the list, you aren't incentivised to attend until many at the top of the list have a number of pieces.

The system only works when the people in it are responsible - if the person at the top of the stack says "I want everything" as they would be entitled to under this system, others will resent it.  Conversely, they may be very charitable - too charitable, to counter this potential.  It may be best to be second or third in the stack so that you can take everything offered to you without as much fear as at the top.

So... what Skyfox has done is actually quite subtle - Skyfox has suggested, in effect, a class-based seniority system.  It becomes the responsibility of the people she has put at the top of the list to share loot around.</textarea>
