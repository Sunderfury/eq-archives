              <textarea name='comment' cols='80' rows='18' class=textarea>Because what you said in your reply involved me too in the sense that I had 
planned to keep my gems that I need too as I said I don't want to solo the same
gems over and over again I'm sick of it, especially when there are other solo able 
classes that don't need the gems that I do that will get them while they get theirs 
(if they solo for theirs) and can offer those ones to the top ppl that can't solo them for 
themselves as effieciently and so forth just like I am with the ones I don't 
need,I am not expecting gems from top and as for BP gems I never expected 
those to be handed to me, I expected to eventually get them through raids that 
I attend and earning them by helping others get their BP gems and so forth.

I know I'm not involved with whomever your mad at but the reasons your mad at them 
make me feel bad becuase I've kept the gems that I need. 

As for resist stuff I plan to raise the money I need after I get my faction up,
I don't like to rely on other people giving me they're stuff all the time 
especially when I can get it myself  besides then it's mine and no-one can ever 
question that, call me proud thats just the way I am But I appreciate your offer.. 

I can understand about helping others etc... In fact I thought I was already 
with the gems I've posted. Surely if everyone donated gems that they don't 
need the results would be the same as what you suggest. 
There are soloable Pure casters, soloable Priest classes and even soloable mellee 
classes(mainly due to level etc..) that if they did solo some of their gems they 
would get others that they don't need and could donate aswell and everyone would 
be happy. 
Put it this way the gems that I keep means I won't be asking for them later and 
taking them from people who can't get them for themselves as easily. I am quite 
happy to help out in group farming situations to help others get gems in places 
where they drop more frequently etc... I just don't want to keep soloing for my 
gems all the time.
