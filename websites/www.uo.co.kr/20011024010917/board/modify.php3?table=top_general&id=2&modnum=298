A sarcastic person might look back and notice that Yilzamoosik was rewarded for his time in EA with a cobalt breastplate.  Is that selfish also?

I was hoping that one of the "leaders" of EA as such would at least uphold the virtues of a system that he may not find useful now, but certainly was useful to him in the past.

What time and effort did Sung contribute towards getting Yilzamoosik a cobalt breastplate?  5 points worth, congratulations.  Ggak, Superlm, Chuns and countless others contributed a lot more, and even if its not beneficial for Temple of Power to follow the virtues preached by EA's leadership, I would hope that there was enough decency out there to do the right thing and not follow Moonroses' example, because that would put you on the same level as her.

"There is no EA anymore.. This is one such reason why.. "

Without causing offense, the reason that I see for EA failing is because people got what they wanted from EA and didnt return.

The entire of ToP has my respect, but I find it hard to accept this.  Thats all I have to say.  If any of you have a problem with this, send me a tell and we'll agree to ignore each other.
