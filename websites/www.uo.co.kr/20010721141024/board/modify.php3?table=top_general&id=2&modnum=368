I got a new job, as you know.

I retied from the company on November, 2000 and started EQ.
Old Valona introduced EQ to me.... ( and he left me alone in this mud-like mud.)
hehe, in fact, it was i that ordered EQ for him two years ago. ^^
At that time, he tried to make me play EQ together with him, but, before EQ, Diku Mud based on Text had made my life ruined yet. so, i had to deny his proposal.

But.... now.... i returned to Virtual World again and am waiting for TP at redball. T.T

for 4 months, i have concentrated on EQ and been so happy with you, all.

Owing to EQ, I had to lose the chance to get a new job ^^

But, now I strated working again. ( ..... What is living? why am i not rich? T.T )

So, as you guess, i shall have less time to play EQ.
Nevertheless, i'll not retire from EQ.

And I bought another new Account. :)
(In fact, one guy in my new company bought EQ but never played. so, I robbed him of it. Kaka~... with Velious~ )

After some time, I'll prepare for another computer to control two PCs at the same time.

You will see my new poor wizard so soon. (Caster is my type)

Anyway, wish me to earn enough money not to work for living and to concentrate on EQ only, plz~

I wish to see you, all so oftenly in Norrath.

Thanks.</textarea>
