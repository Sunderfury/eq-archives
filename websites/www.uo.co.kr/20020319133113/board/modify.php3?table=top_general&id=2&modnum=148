Due to the busy new job in real world, I leave EQ for about 2-3 months, and seems that I really miss my friends on net and wanna fight with u guys once again.
Now, I am really back and hunting in the new continent Velious with some of my best friend who still in here, ( Fox, Tc, Hangang, and many many....)
Although now ToP seems a bit different to that b4 I leave, but Temple of Power still is the Temple of Power, no matter ppls changing or what, just if my friends who still in here, I wont give up. Specially I feel very happy that Phoebus back to us once again, he is one of the best friend of mine in GoN b4, maybe new ToP member dunno about what is GoN, but no matter coz guild is just a channel to connect us together. No matter u feel some ppls too selfish or sometime too naive.
Just remember, friendship is something that cant count on money or stuff.
Sorry to use this guild board to say out some of my own opinion. If u think this message is just some kind of bullshit, :) ( Ccen pls cancel that words if foul lang is not so good in here keke. ) Just forget it, becoz my real friend will know what I am really thinking. As I usually said b4, No matter u like or what, Hephaes will still doing his own way. If u need me, just send me a secret tell.</textarea>
