------You are damn right Lilwars/Hydron. The people who got the stuff from you should at least thank you but they did´t. Dunno the reason(<br>
------Tell me when i can help you. I will always be up for helping you, bro )<br>

I spent 2 months non stop trying to get gems that I needed untill I could'nt handle it anymore, theres no way I would give up <br>
my gems that I worked so hard for so I have to do it all over again, but as a result of how <br>
my luck was with having my gems that I needed drop I have quite a few caster melee gems, same should go with a caster or melee <br>
farming they're gems as they'd get gems they don't need but other people do in the process, thats how I think it should be done.<br>
Anyway Lilwars as I said I have a few melee gems go check my reply to badas post on quests gems and see if I have what you need.<br>

this is not how ToP is or shall I say was..<br>
<br>
Don't think you are the only one that has camped gems.. I have sat MANY MANY MANY hours solo killing Sentient Suits and Geonids for gems..<br>
<br>
But yes, I am more then willing to give up what I have got solo for the guild because this is how it SHOULD be. Even though they can be used by my class.<br>
<br>
I would much rather see many people happy then for just me to be happy because I have what I need and be greedy by not letting others complete their quests because i want to complete aLL of mine..<BR><BR></td>

<br>
After Velious came out, I was still going to Fear ( I started just before epics came out) trying so hard to get my armour as everyone said thats what you need to do besides levelling <br>
to go to any fun big raids. So I tried my hardest to build up on my seniority but it was hard, no guilds in my timezone would let me go on there raids and EC was'nt strong enough so <br>
I had to rely on American lead raids&nbsp;&nbsp;which meant I could only go on the weekends except I could occasionly go during my daytime during holidays. I had finally built up my seniority <br>
and started getting peices untill towards the end those fear leaders had left and I had to go on raids with same people but different leaders. Anyway there was alot of bad loot decisions <br>
(like verm tunics going to ppl on their first raids etc..) and some very pathetic breaks which lost me alot of experience so evntually I got sick of it all getting me down and decided to work on my Thurg quest armour instead.<br>
<br>
I spent about 2 months soloing wyverns and suits day and night non stop trying to get my quest gems, in the process I got alot of gems I did'nt need and so eventhough I could sell them for 1k each as <br>
I desperatly need money as I wish to buy some resist jewellry as my poison/magic suck and I have no items in bank of any value I decided to collect these gems for my current guild at the time Emerald Crest, <br>
hell I'd still like to help some of these people, during that time I got 2 extra gems that I needed and promptly gave them to Garrath for 2 reasons 1 because he was my partner and 2 because he can't solo as efficently <br>
like other classes that needed it can and suits were impossible for him to solo. After 2 months I was sick of soloing in the same place day in day out, it was'nt any fun and I had'nt had any fun in the game for <br>
an awfully long time so despite the fact I had'nt quite got everything I needed I decided to have an extended break from it as soloing all the time was driving me crazy.<br>
<br>
There was'nt many ppl in EC to fight with in my evenings, Forthyr and Ggak were busy with eurasia and stuff which I could'nt do as I just did'nt have the resists required on top of the fact I was just another druid, and <br>
It would take me hours to try and get in a seb pick up group which ain't fun.<br>
During my daytime I have RL stuff to do at the same time so I could'nt join any raids etc.. due to my frequent extended afk's, so all I could do was solo and I was sick of it, then just about everyone in EC left,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
most times I was the only one online. Members had the option to join Uprising due to Trenqil but I was'nt interested in an uber guild I liked Emerald Crest but unfortunately there was no one around to have fun with,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
So eventually through Garrath's persuasion I left and joined TOP.<br>
<br>
Garrath managed to persuade me to join you guys because of the fact that all the guys we'd met had been extremely nice and all your raids were 'fun', you guys did'nt seem like a big Uber guild although you guys are <br>
so efficient people would think you were, you guys seemed similar to the 'Family' that EC had except there was lots of you guys in my time zone so I joined.<br>
<br>
Shortly after, I found there was a slight hitch, all you guys were aiming at totally opposite factions that I were and I did'nt want to keep soloing all the time so I had to make a decision on three options 1 leave<br>
and find a guild on the same faction path as me 2 solo or 3 change factions after a while of watching you guys have fun in guildsay I decided to change my faction and started to join you guys on your fun raids,<br>
When ToV raids started I was hoping to get some sow boots and get other peices later on, I never realised how often this leather would drop and how little leather classes would attend so was amazed at how quickly <br>
I was building up peices. Now when I get my faction up with giants I can complete 4 sets not because I was greedy but because I PUT THE TIME IN despite the fact I was'nt having fun to get those gems I needed previousely. <br>
<br>
I heard that ToP were collecting gems for there members so I had to make a decision&nbsp;&nbsp;to either keep those gems I did'nt need for the ppl I'd had already collected them for a while ago who wer'nt actively persuing <br>
there armour quests yet or offer them to ToP for those classes that could'nt solo as effiently who were my current guild members and were actively persuing there quests. So I chose to help out ToP.<br>
<br>
I thought that I was doing a nice thing but it seems to be coming out right here that thats still not enough, I assumed if everyone contributed there would be enough for everyone but it seems I'm expected to hand in <br>
everything and expected to spend another 2 or so months soloing day and night to collect my gems again if I'm allowed to even keep them, when I already have to go back to collect the ones I'm missing. <br>
Well I'm sorry but I don't want to go through that all over again I play this game for fun and would like to get the soloing I have left to do for faction and my missing gems out of the way. <br>
If that makes me a bad greedy person then just tell me and I'll promptly leave, I'm not or never have been a loot whore and will not stay in a guild if thats what everyone thinks, this is a game I play it to have fun.<br>
<br>
Anyway I want to know what people think because this is bothering me and I would like to get it resolved one way or another.<br>

	<hr noshade width='80%' align='left' color='#cccccc'><br>no one said it was you who was greedy so I am not sure what prompted any response from you.. Matter of fact you were not in my mind at all..<br>
<br>
but in response to your post I will say the following:<br>
<br>
You may have a lot of gems to complete many of your quests. However without the guilds help you will never be able to complete the BP.&nbsp;&nbsp;the other gems you have are not rare.<br>
<br>
All I am saying is spread the wealth and wait for more to come..Rather then having someone that has not completed ANY quest wait to have to finish even one. Not like we would abandon you when you have helped others already.. <br>
<br>
BTW, If you needed resist gear why didnt you ask? We are a guild, not a bunch of individuals running around.. I know a particular necro that has some resist gear that isn't used currently.. Maybe need to ask him :P<BR><BR></td>

	<hr noshade width='80%' align='left' color='#cccccc'><br>Because what you said in your reply involved me too in the sense that I had <br>
planned to keep my gems that I need too as I said I don't want to solo the same<br>
gems over and over again I'm sick of it, especially when there are other solo able <br>
classes that don't need the gems that I do that will get them while they get theirs <br>
(if they solo for theirs) and can offer those ones to the top ppl that can't solo them for <br>
themselves as effieciently and so forth just like I am with the ones I don't <br>
need,I am not expecting gems from top and as for BP gems I never expected <br>
those to be handed to me, I expected to eventually get them through raids that <br>
I attend and earning them by helping others get their BP gems and so forth.<br>
<br>
I know I'm not involved with whomever your mad at but the reasons your mad at them <br>
make me feel bad becuase I've kept the gems that I need. <br>
<br>
As for resist stuff I plan to raise the money I need after I get my faction up,<br>
I don't like to rely on other people giving me they're stuff all the time <br>
especially when I can get it myself&nbsp;&nbsp;besides then it's mine and no-one can ever <br>
question that, call me proud thats just the way I am But I appreciate your offer.. <br>
<br>
I can understand about helping others etc... In fact I thought I was already <br>
with the gems I've posted. Surely if everyone donated gems that they don't <br>
need the results would be the same as what you suggest. <br>
There are soloable Pure casters, soloable Priest classes and even soloable mellee <br>
classes(mainly due to level etc..) that if they did solo some of their gems they <br>
would get others that they don't need and could donate aswell and everyone would <br>
be happy. <br>
Put it this way the gems that I keep means I won't be asking for them later and <br>
taking them from people who can't get them for themselves as easily. I am quite <br>
happy to help out in group farming situations to help others get gems in places <br>
where they drop more frequently etc... I just don't want to keep soloing for my <br>
gems all the time.<br>
