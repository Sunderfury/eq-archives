              <textarea name='comment' cols='80' rows='18' class=textarea>Step 1:
go to Garadain and speak with him (-2700, -400). he will tell you he lost his blanket and needs a new one. to make it you need 2 HQ tundra kodiak skins and 2 HQ cougar skins. these 4 items are combined in a sewing kit to make the no drop blanket. this blanket is NOT trivial at 70 when i made mine. and i heard people fail at skill up to 82 and such. so not sure when it becomes trivial. give Garadain the blanket and he rewards you with the Copper Coldain Insignia ring (1ac 1str 1magic). he also speaks now about another quest segment.
step 2:
Garadain speaks of his brother or something... Baridain. Baridain is out hunting for a Rabit Tundra Kodiak and 
needs his weapon. Garadain gives you an axe to give to Baridain and asks you to return with proof that he is ok and turn in the ring. Go to Baridain at roughly -2500, 1500. its a plataeu. give him the axe. the stupid dorf starts his little adventure. your job, KEEP THE @#%$ ALIVE! he goes to the giant fort to poke around, then up tward the prison guards, to the orc fort, and then finally back to his spawn point. he doesnt have many hp so watch him closely. (charm with chanter and buff him helps). once he gets back to his spawn point alive, he mumbles about the stupid kodiak and then the kodiak spawns. kill the kodiak and get the skin off of it. Give Baridain the skin so he thinks he's a good hunter. in return Baridain returns to you a damaged axe. go back to Garadain and give him the damaged axe along with the copper coldain insignia ring. in return you get the silver coldain insignia ring (2ac 2str 2magic).

Step 3:
(Note: Skining Rock loc: -7600, 1150, it could spawn anywhere around the dragon statue)
Garadain needs a new skinning knife. he asks for you to make him one. to make it, you need 1 HQ walrus skin, 1 wooly rhino horn, and 1 skinning rock. combine these items in a forge and it yields the coldain skining knife that Garadain needs. This item is not nodrop so i can make it for you. was trivial at 190 skill. return to 
Garadain and give him the silver insignia ring and the skinning knife. in return you get the gold coldain insignia ring (3ac 3str 3magic). 

Step 4:
This part gets a bit tricky. Garadain says the knife was good but its not quite up to his specs so he wants a 
coldain smithing hammer to fix the knife. speaking with him further he says that Tain Frostbight has one. 
Garadain gives you a note to Tain (which appears to be useless). when asked about Tain, Garadain says he 
left a short time ago to settle a score with a certain Kromrif. Head down to -4900, -2500 (or very close to 
there). Tain spawns there. but his last name is not Frostbight like Garadain said. its Tain Frosthammer or 
something. (he is on about a 40 minute timer). when hailed he says he is in trouble and needs help. do not tell him you will help him til you are buffed up and ready for a battle! When you tell Tain you will help him, he says that Khrak is coming for him with his war party. The giants spawn when you tell him you will help him. Just east, near the bridge, 4 giants spawn. one being Khrak. you need to kill Khrak and get the frost elixir off of him. Give Tain the Frost elixir and he will give you the coldain smithing hammer. return to Garadain and give him the hammer and the gold ring and he will return to you the Platinum Coldain Insignia Ring (you guessed it... 4ac 4str 4magic).

Step 5:
Garadain tells you of some impending orc danger. he asks that you find the Ry'Gorr messenger and get his 
invasion plans. I dont know where this guy spawns, but he is not all that rare and seems to roam between 
the giant town and the orc fort. When you get the invasion plans, you need to turn them into the coldain 
lookout. he is in same camp as Garadain. When you give him the plans, a group of 6 orcs will spawn. one 
named guy. this is tough battle so make sure you have chanter to mez. the orcs spawn about 200 feet off to the west of the camp. so have people there to get the agro. you dont want the orcs getting to the camp, you might lose the named guy to the dwarfs. kill named guy and get the head he drops. return to Garadain and deliver him the head and your platinum ring. he returns you an Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring. (5ac 5str 5magic).

Step 6:
(once he hands you your new Obsidian Coldain ring, Note that he says: you have Proven yourself)
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Without your assistance, we would have lost our camp and our lives. Again, I thank you. Now that you have proven your loyalty to the throne I have a special [favor] to ask of you. 
You say, 'what favor'
Garadain Glacierbane says 'For several seasons there has been an unsolved mystery in this land. Not far from here an elite team of Coldain and their trained wolves were gathered to make a strike at the Kromrif. No one knows just what became of our strike force. Bring me proof of their fate and proof that whoever was responsible for their loss is no more.

at around neg 8000, neg 3500, theres a coldain hut, a ghost spawns at night(game time) he asks you for Proof that you have PROVEN yourself to the Coldain, then he will tell you his plight.. Hand him your Obsidian Coldain insignia Ring, he will hand the ring back to you, then, Icefang, his dogy in a hut next to him will become KoS to all players, and track down the orcs whom killed his master ( just invis and follow icefang, good to have a enchanter with you so that if he attacks a player, the chanter can mez and mind blur him), icefangs leads you to the orc camp just to the right of the iceclad brigdes, about 5 orc oracles spawn, kill the named one and loot "Note to kromrif" 

Rodrick spawns at -3400, 1070, the broken cave zone out near the orc fort
Ry'gorr Emissary Runs from the South to Rodricks Spawn Point, he is 100% MR, so you cant Root or Mez him, if you agro him, either have a monk with you, or you can try something a bit tricker which is what i did: i had a cleric with me, using Atone, i would hit Hide/sneak at the end of the Atone cast, i had to do this Twice... because well, i wasnt expecting this guy to come along.. heres what the Orc says if you leave him at Rodricks Point without agro for about 40 seconds:

Hand Garadain the Head of Rodrick and the Note to Kromrif and the Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring:
he hands you a Mithril Coldain insignia Ring (6/6/6 in stats) and says:
Garadain Glacierbane lowers his head and mutters, 'At least there will be some closure for their families, thanks to you. The Ry`gorr will pay for this with their lives! I will ask you to help us in the invasion of Ry`gorr keep, but first I have a delicate [mission] I was hoping you'd handle.' 

Step 7: (so far)
You say, 'what mission'
Garadain Glacierbane says 'A Coldain... A very important Coldain, has been abducted by the Rygorr. He was gathering information that is imperative to our victory over the brainless heathens. You must find him before he is killed and escort him to safety. Return to me with the Mithril ring and with proof that Corbin Blackwell is safe. 

Corbin blackwell can be found around Neg 35, Neg 470, Landmarker prison
You say, 'hail Corbin Blackwell'
Corbin Blackwell says 'Hurry! Theres not much time, give me the key and show me proof that you are a friend sent to rescue me... 
You say, 'what key'
Corbin Blackwell says 'You mean to tell me you don't have the key to unshackle me? Wonderful... I'm being rescued by a half-wit! I am stuck here until you find a way to unlock my restraints. 

Ok, Warden Bruke is right next to Corbin Blackwell in another building, you will need about 2 groups to be safe, once you agro Warden Bruke he spawn call about 5 More Giants that hit for 100, and of course, cant be mezed and are about 90% MR.. kill Warden Bruke, Loot Shackle Key, give Shackle key and Mithril ring to Corbin, he will get up and walk to the nearest coldain outpost, at Half Way point, Corbin will say something along the lines of 'They have found out i am trying to escap!' about 4 giants, 4 orcs come out, kill em, keep on going.. heres what they say when they get to the outpost:
Corbin Blackwell says 'I have escaped! With the help of our friends here I was saved from certain death. We are in their debt. 
Dobbin Crossaxe says 'We thought it was too late, the Dain will be very pleased! 
"Corbin Blackwell depops here"
Dobbin Crossaxe says 'Please friend, show me your Mithril ring and I will show you our gratitude. 
"hand Dobbin the Mithril ring"
Dobbin Crossaxe says 'Thank you, Darkcana , your deeds will be mentioned to the Dain. Please take this note from Corbin to Garadain, it may help him to achieve victory over the enemy. 
"Hand Note and Mithril Ring to Garadain"
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Thank you, Darkcana , your service to our people has been most helpful. The time has come for our people to make war with the Ry`gorr. They must pay for their transgressions against our people. We are just waiting on you. Prepare yourself for glorious battle and tell me when you are [ready]. 

Step 8:
You say, 'i am ready'
Garadain Glacierbane says 'Very well, Darkcana , give me the Adamantite ring and I will give you the marching orders. Once the orders are given to Gloradin in the next hut, we will be underway. You then must follow me to what will be our battleground. I must warn you, I will hold your ring until the head of Chief Ry`gorr is given to me. If we fail, all will be lost... for both of us.</textarea>
