I notice that our guildmember are not gathering together as before. This case has been happened after RoK released Coz there were so many attractive zone are waiting for our exploring. However, After SoV released, the cases are more complicated due to more zone and epic are pending for most of us still. I am appreciated some of us who willing to handle raids, Kuyana who lead the PoG raid (and I got the MS3 spell from it too), Pado who books Hate, Fear for armor farming. Yilza who handling Chardok and trakanon raid against EA. Thank you for your planning. I know how busy and hard for those. ALso, I understand every of us with their personal hope. but anyways, I wish ToP will gathering together again to hunt, explore and share every happiness in the world of norrath.
ToP, the guild who formed to gathering together of friend.
Moreover, I would like to announce our spirit again about items sharing. The one who got a better item. He should hand out his/her old one for guildmember who needed for his character enhancement. Certainly, it is a spirit for us and not a force.
Thank you for your kind attention and have a good day )~</textarea>
