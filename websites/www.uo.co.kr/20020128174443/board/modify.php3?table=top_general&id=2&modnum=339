"Let me explain the events that led up to my previous response in this thread, as well as those that lead to this response.
The person that made the recent changes to this zone came to me and pointed out that people were getting the wrong impression about the changes that had been made. The changes were relatively minor, and of the sort that we would normally never explain (we change stuff in zones all the time). But based on what I read in this thread I decided to post to reassure you all that the changes we made were minor. That information came directly from the fellow that made those changes.

When I came in this morning the person that made the changes again came to me, explaining that the players were still getting the wrong impression. He had checked the drop rates again and verified everything. I asked him to show me the zone and the changes. We went over them and verified that the drop rates were exactly as expected, by checking them in game.

We are very certain that the changes we have made are as we expected them to be (as we were when we patched them).

I will outline those changes for you now, though I'm only doing this as a case study and you shouldn't expect us to outline changes like this in detail in the future. Minor changes to zones are part of the evolution of the world.

The NPCS in the entryway have had their armor drops removed. It was far too easy to pull these creatures singly and gather armor pieces that are among some of the very best in the game, items that were intended for raids to gather, not single groups. Armor drops in other parts of the zone were increased very slightly. That is the full extent of the changes.

I personally noted that the ratio of armor to NPC is as it should be in this zone.

I hope this helps to resolve the issue.

In conclusion, we should experiment in TOV to see if we can find any sweet spots.  The zone in will not be the best place to hunt since the entryway mobs do not drop armor - it may be that we hunt the entryway for a rotation until we can clear out some of the deeper spawning mobs.  If you have been beyond the doorway (i.e. been summoned in unless you are Yilza or Hangang or Ragnaarok), there is a great big room with a large number of mobs, including ugly wurms - it *may* be possible to find a quiet corner in here but also may not, given the AE of mobs and the flight path might make it far, far too easy to agro mobs deeper in.

If Absor's comments are correct, we may benefit by getting a big team together (us and Tali even) and trying to find out where the drop percentages are better and if we have a way to hunt there given the size of our normal raiding party.

If we can't get into a groove on where and how to hunt TOV, this will be disappointing - 6 chain drops last time we hunted and only 2 to guildmembers (none to me - T T).</textarea>
