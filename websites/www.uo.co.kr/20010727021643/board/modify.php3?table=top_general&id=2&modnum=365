              <textarea name='comment' cols='80' rows='18' class=textarea>Gracei suggested this Friday (Asia time) for 3 Generals (1 TOP and 2 IHK).  That's about an hour for all 3 now.

Why is this?

1. No more Daytime/Nighttime Spawns

The hard dark elves stay spawned continuously now.  It's harder to break up the initial spawn (COTH/FD pulling combo with Harmony works well) but the respawn time is at least 8 hours so once you've cleared the cabin, it's all clear.

The General is spawned by giving an item to any one of the hard spawns.  What this means is that you can keep just one mob up all the time and keep pulling the General for as many rogues as is needed - as soon as you have mana, you can fight him.

2. No more Night fights with Clerics healing the General

One of the problems that made the General tough was the nighttime wandering undead who would heal the General.  You can now fight the General during the day - so it's just a matter of fighting him.

The General quads in the 250s range - this is not a hell of a lot harder than the average mob Yilza or Bhenry or Sung tanks these days.

3. Overall Fight Size

I've been reading reports of just 3 groups taking down the General.  This is something that TOP could do itself or could do easily with IHK - personally, I'd prefer to join with IHK to do this for two reasons... firstly that it reduces the chance of failure and secondly so we can do 3 Generals in quick succession without needing to set up later raids.

Any interest?
