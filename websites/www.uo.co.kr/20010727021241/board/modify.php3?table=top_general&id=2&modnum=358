              <textarea name='comment' cols='80' rows='18' class=textarea>Thanks to TOP for the help on Renux last night - this puts Fafnyr up to the General fight, which is the last difficult part of the Ragebringer quest (the very last part is handing in 4 robes for a side quest item and then handing the lot in for the RB).

I started the RB quest a little by accident - I was interested to see what the quest was like and pickpocketed the first two mobs on my first go, without the deaths that others seem to get.  The next step was the Book of Souls which came up after a TOP raid in Hate for Skyfox - I was just lucky, I had tried for it before without success.  The next step was camping Eldreth which I did for some 12 days, including a marathon stint of 33 hours straight.  Then was Renux last night, where I got support last night from Hephaes, Cutey, Dreadii, Ragnaarok, Pophk, Garrath, Yorkz, Sheree, Jeana, Pisaster, Bakaris... and the fight went very well and very fast.

The General is next.  This is the fight that takes some effort in co-ordination and attendance.  I query whether I should really be doing this as Forthyr has his epic (before I joined TOP but the hardest parts were done with the support of many TOP members) and it's greedy (although maybe then Fafnyr could get an outing on TOP raids more often since he would be more effective than otherwise).  The only reason why it's feasible to do this is that the shaman and rogue epics are two of the easiest quests (requires only an hour of the guilds time to fight the General for the RB).

I was talking to Gracei yesterday.  IHK has 2 rogues up to the General fight.  The quest has changed with the last patch - the high level dark elves stay spawned all the time until killed and can be used to respawn the General over and over without delay (including waiting until nighttime).  IHK and TOP could join forces and complete the RB quests in one batch if people were interested.
