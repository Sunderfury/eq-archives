Notes:
======
 April 10 1999 v0.87
 
 Well since EverQuest is now released to the general public, I am now releasing 
 this document I started writing back in Phase One of the Beta. I will be adding 
 to this document on a daily basis. A new version of this document can be found 
 at http://www.durrow.com/eqlocs.txt.If you document any new areas or find any 
 errors with information below, please drop me an email with just the changes 
 (not the whole document please). 
 
 Since this document has been updated very little since the beta some locations 
 and/or map may be incorrect. 
 
 Special Thanks to Xorn (Dave) for helping me during the beta with mapping by
 never getting angry when I got him killed because I was too busy mapping to notice
 that we had just run under a Cyclops. Thanks to Snorri (Justin) for new zone locs.
 
 
 TIP: During the beta I mapped zone entrances at the exact spot you would cross. 
 This is really not a good idea to do with zones that have "tunnels" that lead
 to other zones. So I have slowly begun to change the zone locations to that of
 where the tunnel begins not where it stops. When sending in zones please try 
 to follow this way of mapping zone entrances.
