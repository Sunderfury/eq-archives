Custom Skins for Players. - Thanks LabRat.<br>
<br>
The Server has the ability to allow players<br>
to use any skin they want. Or choose to use the <br>
Team Skin of the Server. This can be toggled <br>
on the Server Side using the Options Menu.<br>
(Or Telnet Commands). The Client (Player) can<br>
Select &quot;Additional Options&quot; from the Options <br>
menu and select weather or not to use a custom <br>
skin choice. (Provided the Server has it enabled).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weapons<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Name: Pyro-Torch<br>
Item Name: Inferno<br>
Added: Version 0.7<br>
Description: Flame Thrower.<br>
Explanation: Best Used indoors or on slowmiving targets. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weapon uses intense heat to destroy its target. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When firing this weapon be aware that you give <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off heat, which is detected by enemy Rocket <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turrets. When you hit a player wearing a Rocket<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Booster, it increases their heat level and may <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause them to overheat and explode. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Limits: All Armor Types can use this Weapon.<br>
Doesn't do a significant amount of damage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to Large Turrets or Sensors. <br>
Pyro Charge: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Light: 75<br>
Medium: 100<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heavy: 150<br>
Ammo Pack: 75<br>

<br>
Name: Rocket Booster<br>
Item Name: RocketBooster<br>
Added: Version 0.7<br>
Description: High Thrust Jet Pack.<br>
Explanation: Using a highly unstable but highly Potent Fuel source,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This pack can boost its wearer at great speeds. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Item has many warnings however. If overused it will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overheat and explode. Let it cool before Boosting again.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, when landing (or crashing) A hard impact may <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destabalize the fuel and cause the booster to explode.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that in mind, after some practice, a skilled &quot;pilot&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can manuver with great speed and, combined with normal jets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make skilled manuvers with this pack. Looking Up and Down <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; change the Thrust Vector of the Boost. (huh?) Thust is applied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at a -60 degree angle behind you when standing level. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look up this ange becomes more in the negative. So if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you look up at a 30 degree angle, the thrust is applied -90 degrees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behind you, which propells you straight up. Look up at say a 60 <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; degree angle and it propells you backwards. look Down and it will <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; propell you straight forward. It takes a lot of practice but is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very controlable. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: It gets Increasingly difficult to control at Higher speeds. <br>
<br>
Limits: Only Medium and Heavy Armor can use this Device.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Booster Charge:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Med: 100<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hvy: 150<br>
