<b><font size="-2">Twenty-One - Qeynos</font></b><p><font size="2">The letter
  found me in Qeynos. After Surfal's eye opening experience with Cros Treewind,
  we decided to all split up for a few days of rest and relaxation. I had
  decided to go home to the Temple of Thunder and check in with Master Wolten.
  When the letter arrived I was studying up on the flora and fauna of the
  Western Plains of Karana, which became something of a fortuitous coincidence.</font><p><font size="2">The
  letter was from a young Dwarf named Grannith. His father and mine had shared
  many battles together and I knew of him from stories my father had told to me
  as a child. Grannith was leaving Kaladim, according to the letter, and was
  headed to Rivervale. Seeing it as a wonderful halfway point to finally meeting
  one another, Grannith hoped I could head out as soon as possible.</font><p><font size="2">I
  had heard wondrous tales of Rivervale from Root and I knew he had pressing
  business in his homeland, so I was excited to have a good excuse to finally
  go. I consulted with Master Wolten and he concurred that Rivervale was in dire
  need of a Knight of Thunder. I packed my bags.</font><p><font size="1"><b>Day
  Twenty-Two - Qeynos Hills</b></font><p><font size="2">I was able to track down
  Fyodor and Surfal at the Fish's Ale. Though they had enjoyed the fine wares of
  the establishment, they were actually on a fact finding mission regarding
  rumors of shipments from Blackburrow making it into the shops of several
  Qeynos merchants.</font><p><font size="2">The trail had led them to the Fish's
  Ale but had gotten very cold. They were still missing a crucial piece of
  information which they felt would break the mystery wide open. As they
  couldn't find it at the bottom of a flagon, they hadn't made much progress.</font><p><font size="2">I
  told them about the situation in Rivervale and that I had business there and
  both sobered quickly.</font><p><font size="2">&quot;I'm all for new
  surroundings Jhared,&quot; Fyodor beamed. &quot;I have had it up to my
  eyeballs with Sabretooth Gnolls. If I never see another I couldn't be
  luckier.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Surfal's demeanor perked up and then
  soured all at once. &quot;The more distance we put between us and Cros
  Treewind the better,&quot; he sulked. &quot;Let's go.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">We
  gathered Root in the Hills near Surefall Glade and headed out for the Western
  Plains of Karana. The trip to Rivervale is a treacherous one and the best map
  we were able to obtain was far from reliable. Root however, had a strong
  knowledge of the course so we followed his every step as closely as possible.</font><p><font size="1"><b>Day
  Twenty-Three - Plains of Karana</b></font><p><font size="2">The plains are
  unbelievable. I watched with awe as a mighty Treant crossed the horizon from
  north to south this morning. Though little is known about these mystical
  treefolk, the Druids have great respect and trust for them according to Root.
  Surfal added that the Gladesmen also revered the massive creatures who serve
  the will of Tunare as well.</font><p><font size="2">Karana blessed us as we
  traveled the lands bearing his name. We reached the Northern Plains shortly
  before nightfall and decided to camp for the night. Traveling any further
  after nightfall was suicide according to Root and I believed him. The Karanas
  are filled with the sounds of many a wild beast and none of them sounded too
  friendly.</font><p><font size="2">As an aspiring chef and tailor, I was very
  excited to see the great quantity of bears, lions and wolves that traveled the
  plains. I made a note to come back and do some hunting soon.</font><p><b><font size="1">Day
  Twenty-Four - The Gorge of King Xorrb</font></b><p><font size="2">Daylight
  struck and we headed out for the wooden bridge that separated the Northern and
  Eastern Plains of Karana. We crossed the bridge and paused before heading east
  towards the Gorge of King Xorbb.&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2">&quot;These
  Eastern Plains are really rough but they are kiddie play compared to the
  Gorge,&quot; Root warned. &quot;Watch your step, you bunch of oversized
  targets or you'll likely have them torn off by a&nbsp; Griffon.&quot;&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2">Fyodor
  laughed confidently and we set out for the Gorge. Our laughter soon turned to
  fear as we were beset with Griffons and Lion Patriarchs. With the Spirit of
  the Wolf coursing through our veins we were able to outdistance our aggressors
  but it was close.</font><p><font size="2">As we entered the Gorge, Root tensed
  up. &quot;Okay. The Minotaurs and Evil Eyes don't take kindly to our
  trespassing and the Muddites hate everybody including each other so run along
  the tops of the Gorge Wall and don't stop for anything!&quot;</font><p><font size="2">We
  started running, this time heeding Root's warnings with greater respect.&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2">We
  saw the Gorge Minotaurs and Muddites that he promised we would and their
  reaction was instantaneous. By the time I could see the entrance to Runnyeye,
  I was bleeding from several open wounds and limping severely from several
  broken bones in my side and my right leg. I dove for the Runnyeye entrance and
  collapsed in a heap as I hit the cave floor.</font><p><font size="2">Surprisingly,
  our pursuers stopped outside the cave. &quot;They'll not come in here
  friends,&quot; Root explained.&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2">I smiled through
  the pain as Root began to bind my wounds. I was far too weak to use my magic.
  &quot;I'm glad of it, Root. But why?&quot; I asked.</font><p><font size="2">Root's
  face tightened up. &quot;Oh the Minotaurs and Muddites avoid Runnyeye for the
  same reason as everyone else -- they are too scared to come in here.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Surfal
  shot up from his resting place. &quot;They are too SCARED to come in
  here?&quot; he shouted. &quot;Then what are we doing in this godforsaken
  cave!&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Root smiled and said, &quot;well...I
  figure we have a better chance in here than we do out there with those
  beasties.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">We all sighed and tried to rest.</font><p><font size="1"><b>Day
  Twenty-Five - Runnyeye</b></font><p><font size="2">I was awakened by Surfal's
  hushed voice. &quot;Don't move, they are close,&quot; he whispered. We awoke
  Fyodor and Root in the same manner while Surfal explained that a small patrol
  of Goblins were making their way down our tunnel.</font><p><font size="2">Root
  shifted on his heels. &quot;Guys...I don't know what to tell ya. To be honest,
  we are in a bad spot. If we go back out those Minotaurs and Muddites will have
  us for sure. These Goblins will do pretty much the same.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">&quot;I
  have a plan,&quot; Fyodor said gathering us close. &quot;Lets charge the Gobs.
  My grandfather told me stories of these foul little cusses and they startle
  easy. By the time they regain their composure we will be in the Thicket.&quot;
  Fyodor looked to Root. &quot;You do know the way through to the Thicket?&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Root
  shifted again. &quot;Well...I know the general direction anyway.&quot;&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2">As
  the Gobs came around the corner Fyodor, Surfal and I screamed out a battle cry
  and charged full force. Root managed a lackluster &quot;Arrrghh!&quot; and ran
  in behind us. The effect was successful, the mob of Gobs turned and ran for
  the nearest hallway and we went the other direction, following Root's lead.</font><p><font size="2">We
  came to a fork in the tunnels and Root stopped to ponder. We all looked
  amongst each other timidly as Root considered the options.</font><p><font size="2">&quot;I
  hate to push Root, but the Gobs have turned around,&quot; Surfal said with his
  ear to the floor. &quot;In fact, they are getting very close.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Root
  muttered something about Mini-Miney-Mo and took off down the right-hand
  tunnel. The Gobs were closing and Fyodor turned and ran backwards to defend
  our rear. &quot;How much further little one?&quot; Fyodor shouted, his voice
  trembling ever so slightly.</font><p><font size="2">Before Root could make a
  reply, Fyodor flew past us, his feet a good two feet from the ground. I turned
  to look back and saw that the Gobs had grown in number and one in particular
  looked like an incredibly formidable opponent.</font><p><font size="2">As I
  started to look forward again, I tripped over Fyodor and landed on the gravel
  floor. As the Gobs raised their weapons, six Halfling Deputies charged in from
  the cave exit. &quot;Get your long legs moving Junior!&quot; one shouted as he
  brought his staff to bear across the nearest Gob's skull.</font><p><font size="2">Fyodor,
  Surfal, Root and I ran for the exit and turned to help the Deputies as they
  slowly backed out of the cave. When they reached the bright light of the sun
  and saw that they now faced 10 of us instead of 4, the Gobs decided to retreat
  to the safety of Runnyeye.</font><p><font size="2">The abrasive little Deputy
  slapped Fyodor on the hip (which was arm's length for him) and laughed,
  &quot;Glad to have ya, Long Legs! I am Deputy Budo of the Wall and I welcome
  you to Rivervale and the Misty Thicket.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">After
  Root exchanged many happy returns with the Deputies, we all traveled to the
  city where Budo promised us a fine meal.</font><p><font size="2">I hope to
  find Grannith tomorrow.</font>
