    <p><font size="2">There was little mistaking what Surfal had found. The medallion was
    indeed an Order of Thunder amulet and the bloodstained letter was sealed with the sigil of
    the Temple of Thunder. I tried to rationalize what Surfal had said when he gave them to
    me. He described a grisly undead warrior who attacked him and spoke in the tongue of a
    madman. He said that although he barely survived, the ghastly monster had thanked him when
    Surfal ended its miserable existence. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">My mind struggled with the details.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If the monster were truly an undead man, warped by foul magicks, who had
    he been? In my lifetime there was only one man who had ever been given the Order of
    Thunder amulet and that was Sir Drosco. I knew most of the Temple Knights who had trained
    me carried them, having received them long before I came into this world, but I had seen
    them all only days before and they all were fine. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">As my heart tried its best to keep the truth from my mind, I thought
    back to my younger days in the temple. Amongst the active Knights of Thunder, there were
    no others lke Drosco. His honor and faith were unmatched and Karana held him close. He
    once returned from an expedition to Southern Ro with the headdress of a mighty Sand Giant.
    It was a gift for Sir Wolten, whose family had been slain in the deserts by such a
    creature. Drosco earned his amulet for a mission he undertook in Innothule Swamp. He
    ventured into the very heart of the Troll Lands to rescue the daughter of a Lake Rathe
    fisherman. He was the envy of every Knight of Thunder in the temple and the inspiration
    for everyone whom he met.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I knew that I needed to take Surfal's findings to the Temple of Thunder,
    so I asked my friends to wait for me at the Fish's Ale. They agreed and I set out for the
    temple.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Sir Wolten beamed a smile my way as he saw me approaching from across
    the courtyard. When I handed him the letter and the amulet, I saw him shake a little. I
    had never seen my old master tremble and the sight of it caused my skin to goosepimple. I
    knew from his reaction, even before he said it, that the wretched zombie in the aqueducts
    must have been Drosco. My eyes watered and my chest seemed empty. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Your friend found this where, Jhared?&quot; Wolten asked through
    blank eyes.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;In the catacombs below the city, master.&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Wolten crumpled the letter in his hand and I watched his grief boil into
    fury. He rubbed the amulet in between his fingers and his face grew red. &quot;Bertoluxxus
    will pay for this! His foul Bloodsabres will know the wrath of the Rainkeeper and they
    will rue this day!&quot; Wolten threw the amulet to the ground and stormed away towards
    the armory. I was not sure what to do and my mind raced with confusion.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The Bloodsabres? But they were only a children's story. I spent many a
    sleepless night in my bed dreading the dark worshippers of Bertoluxxus who storied said
    were animating corpses in the sewers under the city. But all that was fantasy. Any man
    over the age of eighteen had long since given up believing in such ridiculous stories.
    Commander Bayle would never allow an army of Necromancers to live free under the city. It
    was impossible. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I looked at the crumpled letter on the ground. I picked it and the
    discarded amulet up and went to my quarters to rest. As I read the letter, I felt as
    though I were a boy of eight again, long dead fears rising up from their hiding places to
    grip at my heart. Wolten had sent Drosco to infiltrate the Bloodsabres. They were real and
    they had discovered Drosco's true nature. The horrors the letter described were sure to
    haunt my dreams. The letter had been written after his reanimation and the haunting
    &quot;thank you&quot; Drosco had uttered to Surfal as he fell suddenly made sense. Trapped
    in the decaying body, his mind twisted and warped by magic and pain, he still sought to be
    released.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I thought of my poor master and the anguish he must be feeling. He had
    sent Drosco into the hands of these evil ones and they had tortured and killed him, then
    remade him into unlife. I prayed that Karana would watch over my master and that his grief
    would not destroy him. That was when it hit me. He had run for the armory! He meant to go
    down there and avenge Drosco. I jumped from my bed and ran to the door. I sprinted to the
    main hall and I stopped in my tracks. The guildmaster himself was standing over Sir
    Wolten, who was lying down on a pew. His holiness looked up and saw me and he smiled.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Do not worry, Jhared. He will be alright. Until he can come to
    terms with Drosco's death, I have asked Karana to help him rest. May I have the letter and
    the amulet?&quot; </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I handed them over without hesitation. &quot;Your holiness, what will we
    do? Bloodsabres truly exist!&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Jhared, you were not meant to know of this until you were better
    prepared. We have always known the Bloodsabres were real. Recent events forced us to try
    and infiltrate their ranks and Drosco had volunteered. Now that they know we are on to
    them, things may move more quickly. There may be very hard times ahead for us, my son.
    Hard times indeed.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I looked over the two of them. &quot;How may I help, your
    holiness?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;You must try and forget all of this for now, Jhared. You are not
    ready to face the Bloodsabres and should word of this leak outside the Temple, panic would
    ensue. That would work in the favor of our adversaries, do you understand?&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I did. I promised to keep the news secret and I was instructed to go on
    about my business. He knew I had agreed to aid the Erudite woman whose apprentice was lost
    at sea. He ordered me to fulfill my obligations to her and take the boat to Erud's
    Crossing as soon as possible.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I went to pack for the trip. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">When I walked into the Fish's Ale, I tried to erase the dread from my
    face.</font></td>
