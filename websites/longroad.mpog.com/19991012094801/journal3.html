Fyodor has headed back out into the Qeynos Hills. A report came in that the Sabretooth Clan was massing a large squad outside Blackburrow for a raid on Surefall Glade and Fyodor wanted to be a part of the resisting force in the Glade.<p>

Fyodor has a deep hatred for Gnolls. I have not been able to determine why, but it seems to drive him. At the very mention of Gnolls he grows physically agitated. <p>

I promised to look him up in the Hills, as it appears he lives out there, only coming into town for the essentials once every few weeks. <p>

I reported back in with Sir Wolten yesterday and I was commended for my service to Karana. I was not given another assignment at this time, so I have opted to get better acquainted with the wildlife outside the city gates. There seems to be a constant battle waging out there against undead scouts coming in from the Hills.<p>

<b><font size="-2">Day Eight - Qeynos</font></b><p>

I have spent the last two days knee-deep in the shattered bones of skeletons. I met an intriguing halfling named Root in the city and we hunted together for some time. He is a Druid and a loyal servant of Karana. We have been responsible for countless vanquished skeletons and have put an end to the threat of Fippy Darkpaw, who attacked a young mage in the woods outside Qeynos.<p>

Root has a storied past it seems. In his homeland, there are no Gnolls but instead they are plagued by Goblins, monsters I thought were more legend than reality. He says that his people are in constant struggle against these monsters. He has come to Qeynos to obtain a special artifact needed by his people and to hopefully enlist some aid. Assuming Sir Wolten has no objections, I plan to accompany the little Druid to Rivervale when he heads home.<p>

He doesn't think it will be for another week or two, so that gives me time to get my business with the Temple in order beforehand.<p>

<b><font size="-2">Day Nine - Qeynos Hills (outside Blackburrow)</font></b><p>

I never dreamed I would be sitting here, in the mouth of the Gnollface that acts as the gateway to Blackburrow, but I am. Root encountered a wounded Halfling in the Hills who desperately needed aid in recovering an object stolen from him by a band of Gnolls. They had escaped into Blackburrow with the object and so we wait here for the arrival of my friend Fyodor, who has offered to guide us into the gaping maw of the Gnoll homeland.<p>

We also enlisted the services of a local bard, which Fyodor thinks is crucial to our success.<p>

As we entered the Gnolls' lair, I felt an odd sensation ripple through my body and I jumped as my skin began to grow hard and stiff. Before I could scream in terror, Root took me by the arm and said, "Look mate, its just a spell. Karana allows me to bless you and the others with skin hardened like wood for your safety." I felt much better and began to realize that I had been lax in my duty to this group of heroes. I also had the blessings of Karana at my fingertips. I quickly imbued the group with Karana's courage and everyone was quite pleased.<p>

"Save your magicks for healing Priest," Fyodor smirked. "We'll be needing them in here."<p>

"I want everyone to stay very close to me," Fyodor continued. "This is a nasty pit, this Blackburrow. Full of traps and illusions meant to end ya."<p>

Root and I stood a little closer. I realized that to a halfling all of this must seem very disconcerting. Gnolls are towering monsters from my vantage point, I can only imagine how they seem to a halfling. We started our journey and we all followed Fyodor's lead.<p>

We avoided the wandering parties of Gnolls we spotted and tried to use the paths already cleared by other adventurers. As we approached a large underground pond, Root spotted something  we had been looking for. The Gnoll who had beaten and robbed his kin, was said to be wearing a pair of lapiz wristbands, which were likely stolen from some other hapless traveller. Root spotted the wristbands and pointed the Gnoll out. The wristbands were attacked to a very large Gnoll, who sported a long vicious-looking spear. Fyodor encouraged me to try my magicks to lull the Gnoll's cohorts. I did so and then Fyodor brazenly attacked the Gnoll we saught. <p>

"Move back near the pond," Fyodor shouted. "I will draw him to you."<p>

It was a bold plan, leaving Fyodor alone against the beast for several minutes but it worked. When Fyodor and the creature rounded the corner we sprung out behind it and hit it with everything we had. I could see Fyodor was wounded, so I stopped swinging long enough to heal his wounds. We continued bashing away, when suddenly the Gnoll began to run back towards his former companions. If he reached them, we were surely going to die. <p>

That was when Root pulled the ace out of his sleeve.<p>

After a short chant, large tree roots grew up from the ground and twirled themselves around the legs of the beast. It shrieked in terror as Fyodor danced into a battle frenzy. Fyodor cut the beast down in three hits and we all stood over its corpse. It was my first kill, so to speak. I had never been involved in the taking of another intelligent creature's life. I had only destroyed undead and vermin of the Qeynos woods. I found it strangely exhilirating and I must confess I made a terrible mistake. Shaking my fists at the skies, I screamed out at the corpse, "Now you know the wrath of Karana, fiend!"<p>

Smiling, I looked up at the rest of my group and was met by their shocked and angered faces. It wasn't until the group of six Gnolls powered around the corner that I realized my foolish taunting had brought too much attention to our actions.<p>

We ran. We ran and ran and ran. The bard sang a song which caused us to accelerate beyond any speed I had evert traveled in my life and that song saved our skins. When we reached the Qeynos Hills, I apologized to my new friends. The bard was still furious, as he had not been able to take his portion of the bounty from the Gnoll. Luckily, Root had already gathered the stolen object. Fyodor patted me on the back, and said, "Little cleric, do not worry. You will learn to be more careful in the future." With that said, Fyodor led us into the Hills where we agreed to meet the little halfling, laughing heartily the entire way.<p>

With the object returned, the little halfling went back to Qeynos to prepare for his trip back to Rivervale. Root, Fyodor and I decided to head back into the Hills.<p>
