Fyodor, Root and I have been skirmishing with Gnolls outside Blackburrow since last I wrote in this journal. We have been drawing Watchers and Scouts away from their groups and cutting them down. We have a bag filled with Gnoll Teeth for Captain Tillin and I have never seen Fyodor happier. He lives for this.<p>

Root has been a tremendous asset in these conflicts as Karana has given him the great power to keep the cowardly Gnolls from running back to their brethren when they are injured. Though the two seem to insult and threaten each other as often as they do their enemy in battle, Root and Fyodor are becoming good friends. <p>

We realized that we were making an impression on the Sabretooth Clan when two Gnoll Hunters tracked us down near Surefall Glade. Apparently we have the full attention of the Clan and after cutting down the Hunters, we sent a present back to Blackburrow to show our concern -- the heads of the two Hunters wrapped in the skins of two Gnoll pups. <p>

The skirmishes have been profitable. We have a large cache of rusty weapons to sell and a decent bag of coins to show for our efforts. <p>

I met a strange and beautiful woman this afternoon. Her name is Isabo and with no rhyme or reason she appeared and handed me a wonderful present, a mace! Though rusty, this mace is significantly more useful than the club I had been using. She gave no explanation for her gift, saying only, "Though you do not know it yet, you and I will someday be strong allies. Use this and we will meet again." I am still puzzled, but I am grateful for the mace.<p>

As Fyodor, Root and I were wondering this afternoon we came up on an all too familiar sight, a vile skeleton terrorizing a traveller. With the mighty will of Karana, I channeled a Ward and struck the the creature into splinters. The traveller was a young half-elf named Surfal, a Ranger I think. I healed his wounds and Fyodor offered to escort him to his destination. "I am headed in no particular direction, my friends," Surfal explained. "In fact, I am here to look for evidence of a troublesome poacher." <p>

I had heard stories about the Protectors of the Glade. Though they worshipped that overprotective den mother Tunare, I had always heard that their prowess at battle was legendary and that they possessed a unique gift for tracking prey. I was curious to see this talent at work, so I offered to help Surfal find signs of the poacher.<p>

"You know Surfal, we three hunt bears and wolves quite often," I told him. "I would hate for us to come to blows over a simple hunt." 

Surfal frowned. "Jhared, the will of Tunare is the will of the circle of life. As long as the hunt is for the right reasons and the meat and hides are properly used, there is no harm in hunting the animals of the Qeynos Hills."<p>

Fyodor spun on his heels, "I thought you tree hugging bear lovers killed any man on sight who enagaged an animal, Surfal."<p>

"Not exactly, Fyodor," Surfal explained. "That is a common misconception of the Protectors of the Glade. Tunare has charged us with defending the bears of the Surefall Glade, for the Glade is a holy place. We do not treat all bear hunters with such harsh measures, only those who poach in the Glade."<p>

Root jabbed Surfal in the ribs with his long staff to get his attention. "Lookie here, ya pointy eared vagabond," Root said jumping up and down. "That Cros Treewind is well known for such behavior so don't try to soften up your image. Treewind and Windstalker both attack any man, woman or child in sight that touches a bear or wolf in these parts, even if it was the animal what attacked them first. Explain that!"<p>

Surfal's face was a roadmap of mixed emotions. "What you are saying is ridiculous, little one. Cros Treewind and Holly Windstalker are two of Tunare's most respected followers. They are held in high regard by my people and would never behave in the monstrous fashion you speak of."<p>

Fyodor, Root and I exchanged glances and returned our stares to Surfal.<p> 

"Surfal," I began. "Here in the Hills, your heroes are considered to be villains of the highest order. Short of the murderous Tovax Marr and the nefarious Varsoon, there are no two worse creatures in all of the Hills. I am sorry to be so blunt but I fear you do not have the whole story on those two."<p>

Surfal started to draw steel! "You would dare to compare the great Cros Treewind to that vile Varsoon," Surfal shouted. "Be careful of your words, cleric!"<p>

With a quick almost unseen gesture, Fyodor brought his shield into Surfal's face. Left stunned and weak-legged, Surfal dropped his blade and staggered briefly before collapsing in a heap. "I could not allow him to threaten you, Jhared. He will have a bad headache when he awakes, but I do not believe he will have more than a bruise to show for it." Root grinned from ear to ear and said, "I am starting to llike you Fyodor. You have panache!"<p>

We all chuckled a bit and made camp to watch over the "resting" Protector of the Glade.<p>

When Surfal awoke, he was a little more receptive to a civil discussion.<p>

Fyodor, Root and I explained our standing on Treewind and it was determined that we would have to show him the truth. After a brief visit to the Glade, we four set back out into the the Qeynos Hills to open Surfal's eyes to Treewind's brutal form of justice.<p>

It would be a hard awakening for Surfal, I feared, but I knew he needed to know the truth.<p>
