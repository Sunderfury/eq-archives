      <p>&quot;You will have a surprise waiting in Highhold fair skinned
      one&quot; and then he died.</p>
      <p>I had heard rumors and half-truths about such Dark Elves living in the
      forest and in swamps but I never had imagined that I would come face to
      face with one. I wish events had not unfolded the way they had but there
      is little I can do about that now it seems. If only he hadn’t pushed me
      so far.</p>
      <p>My initial searches for Jhared proved fruitless. I could only assume
      that his business with the lady had taken him longer than he had thought
      or perhaps he was engaged in some guild business. Those matters were his
      own and, even though I could easily track him, I felt it best to allow him
      his privacy. Besides, my news of the recent events at Highhold could keep
      for a little while, I was certain. Besides, I had some other business to
      attend too myself and now would be the perfect time.</p>
      <p>As I walked through the merchant square a group of people ran past me
      almost knocking me over. I could scarcely make out their words as they ran
      past but it seemed there was a fight taking place somewhere close between
      a young cleric and local ruffian named Trumpy Irontoe. I imagine Jhared
      would like to see that confrontation. However, I was more interested in
      the merchants near the front gate to Qeynos so I decided to pass on the
      local excitement.</p>
      <p>Near the front gate I found the merchant that I had been seeking. It
      seems he had been having some trouble with rats and was in need of
      assistance. I was very eager to help him since I wanted to be known and
      well liked by these merchants but my search for these mangy rats proved
      fruitless. I was about to doubt my tracking skills when I caught a whiff
      of a most disturbing odor. It was very faint, but very distinct. I can’t
      truly say that it was a bad odor, just ominous if that is possible. The
      scent led me out the front gate of the city and to the right. Daylight was
      failing but my vision is as sharp at night as it is during the day. About
      three hundred yards ahead of me I saw an elf sized being shrouded in dark
      robes and dark painted skin. I began to sneak towards his direction.</p>
      <p>&quot;What do you want fairy&quot; he yelled to me as I was approaching
      his flank. &quot;Think you can get the drop on Jracol Brestiage that
      easily?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No sir&quot; I replied, alarmed that he had so easily detected
      me. &quot;I was merely investigating….&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Shut up&quot; he barked. &quot;You light skinned worshippers of
      Tunare make me sick and need to be cleansed from Norrath. Innoruk has
      deemed the dark Elves to be the only race fit to inhabit these
      lands&quot;.</p>
      <p>My heart stopped beating entirely I am sure. To even speak the name of
      the God of Hate was to invite his wrath. Closer inspection proved that my
      early observations were wrong, this man was not painted dark, his skin
      actually was dark.</p>
      <p>&quot;Are you going to just stand there and wet your pants? Or will you
      run to mommy and tell her the big bad dark elf scared me&quot; he mused.</p>
      <p>&quot;I will not take your insults much longer, stranger, you had best
      leave these parts before I….&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Before you what, whelp? Run to the guards to save your life much
      like these sheep I see out here. I had hoped that at least some of the
      dark elf backbone had crept into you, my fledgling cousin, but I see I was
      mistaken. Go cry to your weak god before I make you my servant!&quot;</p>
      <p>I drew my blade and advanced on his position. Perhaps he was a little
      surprised for I drew first blood using a move Fyodor had shown me which I
      had honed in Erud’s Crossing. I blinded him with the Shiny Brass Shield
      Fyodor had given me and slashed with my sword. He parried my second blow
      and pierced my left leg with his blade. Never had I fought an opponent
      that relied on a piercing weapon before but my initial surprise would not
      last. I missed with my next blow but kicked him in the knee a second
      later. I dodged his weak attempt to pierce my ring mail tunic and sliced
      his stomach open with my next assault.</p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/jracol.gif" width="420" height="315"></p>
      <p>He fell slowly to ground trying to keep his internal organs in place
      but was failing miserably. I was surprised to see that his body looked
      much the same as mine did when the zombie laid me open on that beach. As
      blood bubbled from his lips he stared at me with his black eyes and
      laughed.</p>
      <p>&quot;You have no idea who I am, do you? Well (cough, cough) I know of
      you and your Ka Tet and you will not see another season fair skinned
      freak.&quot; He whispered. &quot;You will have a surprise waiting for you
      in Highhold fair skinned one.&quot;</p>
      <p>What secrets did he take to his grave? Curse my short temper. I shouldn’t
      have let him push me like that. Maybe I should have just walked away.
      Maybe I should have reasoned with him. Maybe…</font></td>
