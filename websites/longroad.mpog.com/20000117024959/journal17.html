      Shadows</font></p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day Eighty-Seven&nbsp; - Highhold Pass</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We entered the pass from the South. The first 100 yards
      were difficult and almost impassible, filled with twisting turns and
      jagged rocks. The fact that anyone had decided to live in this environment
      was difficult to imagine, much less build a Keep.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As we moved ahead, we heard a very familiar sound, the
      yapping and barking of Gnolls. I immediately called upon Karana to protect
      and shelter my companions, showering them with magical wards. I drew my
      mace and we crept ahead.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Hybrow, Samwize and Fyodor took positions in the rocks
      while I peeked around the corner to see the enemy. I was astounded by what
      I saw. This Gnoll was at least seven feet tall, its build was much
      stockier than I had ever seen before as well. Fyodor moved over to my
      position and examined the Gnoll.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Damn,&quot; he mused. &quot;These are no
      Sabertooths. Those are Mucktail Gnolls for sure. Be wary of these, Jhared,
      for these are smarter and stronger than their Sabertooth cousins.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">The Gnoll in question began to wander away when I heard
      the sound of magic. Thinking what I heard was a possible ally, I stood up
      over the rocks to greet them. Much to my surprise, the source of the magic
      was a Gnoll! It caught sight of me immediately and before I could react I
      felt roots and vines from the earth entangle my feet. It had rooted me for
      sure! I never expected to have my own spells used against me. I cried out
      to Fyodor and I noticed he was already engaged. As I struggled to untangle
      myself from the roots, the Gnoll Soothsayer unleashed it scythe, ripping
      through my armor and cutting a nasty gash in my midsection.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/gnollsoothsayer.gif" width="420" height="315">
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I swung my hammer and struck it hard across the
      shoulders but it was obvious I was no match for this ferocious beast. I
      knew Fyodor was deeply involved and so I cried out for Samwize and Hybrow.
      Sam ran around the corner and ran to my aid. He drew his blade and began
      tearing into the Soothsayer with some success. As he fought he whistled a
      stirring song which seemed to wash away my fatigue and pain. I told Hybrow
      to help his old friend and I watched with glee as Hybrow began chanting
      his spell. There is no force under the skies to match the destructive
      power of a Wizard and I knew that with Hybrow behind him, Fyodor would be
      safe.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Samwize and I continued to struggle with the Soothsayer
      and finally my feet came free. I moved to a better position, behind the
      beast and stepped up my efforts. The Soothsayer rooted Samwize and I could
      see his concern grow as the battle waged on. If Fyodor and Hybrow hadn't
      finished off their foe when they did, we might not have survived.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">With the Soothsayer dead, we camped to heal and bandage.
      Samwize looted the corpses and made an incredible discovery, these
      Mucktail Gnolls were equipped with large Ringmail and Raw-Hide armor. That
      explained some of their resilience in battle. Fyodor and Hybrow smiled at
      the loot and explained that such prizes as those would bring a good price
      in the Keep, ensuring a good meal and bed for the night.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I decided it was a good time to come up with a game plan
      for handling Carson's goons. I didn't dare mention my name in the Keep.
      Fyodor suggested I simply use an alias. Samwize suggested a good name and
      everyone liked it. For the remainder of my trip I would be known as Juran
      Ord, a cleric from Qeynos. As I prepared for sleep, I prayed to Karana
      that my father would watch over me.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day Eighty-Nine - Highhold Pass</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We managed to travel for two hours without seeing a
      single Mucktail, but we were easily lost in the many confusing crags of
      the pass. We did encounter a Gnoll Shaman at a crossroads in the pass but
      quickly dispatched him.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/gnollshaman.gif" width="420" height="315">
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We happened upon a drinking establishment and Fyodor
      demanded we stop for a drink. Inside, a raucous group of presumably thugs
      and bandits carried on about their recent exploits. They made everyone in
      the tavern nervous and I feared we would drawn into a fight.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Imagine my surprise when I was told that these ruffians
      were the local militia! I tried to picture my father as one of these men
      and I failed to complete the vision. How could he ever have been so blind?
      Just then the door swung open and a large group of men and women, led by a
      imposing Barbarian figure, burst through the entrance. They were carrying
      a few bodies. I rushed to their side and offered my assistance. As my eyes
      reached the second of the two victims, my heart raced -- it was Surfal.
      His body was bloody and broken but he seemed to be breathing well. He
      grinned deliriously with bloody teeth and said, &quot;Oh Jhared...you
      should have seen it! What a fight....&quot; With that he lost
      consciousness. I glanced nervously about the room, hoping no one had
      noticed his use of my real name.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Fyodor walked over to the table and slapped the
      Barbarian on the shoulder. &quot;Well, brother! How exactly did you come
      upon this little Elf? I hope you didn't do this to him.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">The big man laughed and called for a Stout. &quot;No. I
      am Dargothus. I laid no hands on this little one, except to pull his
      miserable hide out of the clutches of death. I will give him credit
      though, he may not be much of a warrior, but he has the spirit of a Polar
      Bear.&quot; Fyodor and Dargothus sat and talked while Hybrow, Samwize and
      I tended to the wounded. Surfal mainly needed rest after my magic mended
      his broken bones, but his companions were in bad shape. Several had bones
      which were shattered beyond normal repair and one was comatose. I did my
      best for them all and Samwize tried to use his songs to ease their pain
      and lighten their spirits.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Surfal remained asleep all day, so I was unable to warn
      him of my alias. I only hoped that he didn't spoil my cover before I could
      speak with him. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Fyodor approached us and explained the situation.
      &quot;They were battling with Bandits, Orc and Gnolls in the pass here. It
      seems there is a healthy bounty on them and they were all trying to
      collect. I don't think they made any notice of your name, and frankly I
      don't think they care. These are mercenaries, not loyal soldiers. The loud
      group in the corner are Volunteers, but don't let the name confuse you. It
      seems that Carson McCabe runs gambling in the Keep and that these
      'Volunteers' are all working off their debts fighting the Mucktail Gnolls
      and Shralok Orcs in the pass.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Surfal was fighting the Shraloks when a everything
      got out of control. The other wounded are some of Surfal's allies. The
      comatose one is named Samchez, he is another healer like you, Juran.&quot;
      I grinned at Fyodor's use of my alias, it still seemed funny in a way.
      Fyodor leaned in close to whisper. &quot;We need to leave as soon as
      Surfal is better, I don't think it will take long for your safety to be
      compromised with all these mercenary types.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Hybrow nodded in agreement and we waited out Surfal's
      rest. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day Ninety - Highhold Pass</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">When Surfal finally rose from the table on which he had
      been sleeping, he was no more than sore from his injuries. I often stop to
      thank Karana for the incredible healing powers which I have been given.
      This was such a moment.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We took Surfal outside and quickly explained our
      situation. We also told him that word of his battle with Jracol would
      reach Carson soon. He seemed distressed. &quot;I hate to say this, Juran.&quot;
      he used the alias with a sarcastic slant, &quot;but I really like it here.
      I don't think we should just up and leave because you might be in a spot.
      No one here has any idea about me and Jracol and we could make a fortune
      in this pass.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Hybrow seemed to agree with him. &quot;I know you are
      deeply concerned my little cleric, but I agree with my lesser cousin. This
      place is a paradise for people such as ourselves. There is money to be
      made and great challenges to face. I think the best possible course of
      action is to stay for a while. We can handle this Carson McCabe should we
      need to and I think it is better for you to stay and face this matter
      instead of running away.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Cowardice is a bad color on you, my friend.&quot;
      Fyodor said with a straight face. &quot;I know your father's past here
      concerns you but I think you must address at some point and there is no
      better day than this one.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I was shocked. I hadn't ever suspected my friends
      thought me a coward and now that I heard their words, I felt like one.
      They were right, simply because my father had run from McCabe didn't mean
      I had to. If Surfal wasn't afraid of McCabe's retaliation for Jracol's
      death, I certainly shouldn't shy away from a twenty year old dispute. I
      knew McCabe meant me harm and would Surfal too, but it would be better to
      face it all now than watch my back for the rest of my life.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Very well then , my friends,&quot; I said.
      &quot;You may call me Jhared Irsei.&quot; Fyodor, Hybrow and Surfal all
      smiled.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Well I think you are an idiot, but that suits
      you.&quot; I turned and saw the mocking glare of the bard. &quot;But
      that's what I like about you guys. You make me all feel so smart!&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Fyodor led the group in laughter and we walked back into
      the tavern. </font>
