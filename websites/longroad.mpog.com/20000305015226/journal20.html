      </p>
      <p><font size="2">When I awoke this morning, I knew I had to make some
      hard decisions. I knew in my heart that Hybrow had done no wrong with the
      Tier Dal and that my reaction was based purely on my sheltered upbringing.
      I needed to find Hybrow and make sure he understood that. Perhaps even
      more important than that, I needed to determine what Carson's next move
      would be. This assassin would likely not be the last. For the safety of my
      friends and myself, I needed to do something quick. For reasons I couldn't
      begin to explain, I didn't feel a drive for revenge against McCabe. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">In Surfal's case, he had been avenging the
      &quot;murder&quot; of one of his own men. In my case, he was trying to
      settle a score with my father. Somehow that made everything seem less
      personal. In the back of mind I know part of this is that I like it here
      so much. I enjoy my position with the volunteers and I love the respect
      and trust they all have in me. Perhaps I am letting all this go to my
      head, that must be it, because I find myself willing to forgive and forget
      with a man who just tried to have me killed.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">There is only one course of action.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I will have to approach McCabe myself.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day One Hundred and Four (evening) - Highhold Keep</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I left my room this morning to try and find Carson
      McCabe. I had expected he would be a difficult man to find and approach.
      In my mind, I was modeling him after a similar man in a similar position
      in Qeynos, Antonius Bayle. Nothing could have been farther from the truth.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As I walked the hallways of the Keep, I noticed a man
      standing with the guards who had an air of confidence about him so
      overwhelming that it seemed to shine. He stood with presence and his words
      were precise and intelligent. Looking at the way everyone listened to him
      and watched him, it was easy to tell he was a person of high respect in
      the Keep. I quickly gathered he was McCabe.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/mccabe.gif" width="420" height="315">
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">As I approached him, I saw his eyes squint
      as he looked at me. I had always been told I was a good likeness of my
      father, except for the beard which he never wore. His eyes showed a small
      measure of confusion then gleamed as if he were greatly amused. He smiled.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;You must be the man I have heard so
      much about. The hero of the recent Gnoll attack, the mighty Jhared Irsei.&quot;
      His comments seemed genuine enough but I knew he was testing to see if
      knew who had sent the &quot;messenger&quot; last night. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Lord McCabe, I am Jhared Irsei,
      Knight of Thunder and Loyal Servant of Karana. Just as my father was
      before me, I am at your service.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Carson's face went ashen. He did not know
      about my father's journal. He had obviously not expected me to know about
      their feud. &quot;Perhaps we should speak privately where we can better
      enjoy each other's company, Jhared.&quot; As he began to walk away from
      me, urging me to follow, I knew I was taking a great risk. He could easily
      have had men waiting behind any of these doors who would kill me without a
      thought. More than likely he could do the job quite nicely himself.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">I swallowed my fear and followed.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">We went up several flights of stairs and
      settled into a well furnished office on the third floor. He sat in a
      comfortable wooden chair and offered me another, which faced him. He put
      no table or desk between us, which I took as a good sign. He was letting
      me know that he meant me no harm just then. It also showed a certain
      informality which I took to suggest his desire to speak bluntly.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;If you know of your father's days
      here, I assume you know how he left my service.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">I smiled. &quot;McCabe, my father betrayed
      you. In order to save you from committing a terrible act of violence
      against an innocent child, he disobeyed you and for that you targeted him
      for execution. Just as you targeted me last night.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">He showed no sign of surprise at my bold
      accusation. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Your assassin was unable to complete
      her mission and I assume that one of her poisoned darts was meant for
      Surfal Dayspring, after she finished with me.&quot; Carson nodded in
      agreement. That admittedly threw me off, he was so confident that he
      simply admitted to the crime without any explanation.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Jhared, you amaze me. You knew before
      you came here that I would likely make an attempt on your life but you
      came anyway. At first I believed you were unaware of your father's
      situation but now that I know you are I am confused as to why you have
      taken such a passionate role in the defense of my Keep. Are you plotting
      against me or do you simply have a death wish?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Neither. My friend was attacked by
      your spy in Qeynos. He defended himself and killed Jracol as I am sure you
      know. He then left bound for here, unaware of the danger. I could not
      allow him to come to harm, so I rushed here to tell him. I then decided
      that I was needed here. The people of this Keep do not deserve to die at
      teh hands of those wretched Gnolls, no matter what their Lord does under
      the table.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Carson laughed. &quot;You are so much like
      your father, Jhared. God, how I enjoyed his company. Can I offer you a
      drink?&quot; He stood and walked to a chianti of wine and filled two
      glasses. I knew the wine might be poisoned but I also knew he could kill
      me with his bare hands as easily and decided to play it out. I accepted a
      glass and drank. It was quite delicious.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Elven wine. It has no equal. Your
      father loved Elven wine.&quot; I was forced to agree with my father here.
      It was wonderful. I had never known my father to drink, but I am not
      surprised he did.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Carson, if you loved my father so,
      why did you decide to try and kill him?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Don't be foolish, Jhared? You strike
      as far too intelligent to ask that question. Your father betrayed me and
      regardless of my feelings, I had to punish him. It was business. Also, I
      wanted him dead for what he did to me. He was like a younger brother to me
      and he stabbed me in the back over a stupid peasant child. I should have
      known that day would come but I resented it anyway.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;So where does that leave us,
      Carson?&quot; I tried my best to avoid showing the fear his words had
      caused in me.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;I do not know, Jhared. You have
      bettered my assassin. Your friend has uncovered and bettered my spy. You
      have proven to be a very expensive hobby and I am starting to see a
      benefit in keeping you alive. I will make you a deal, Jhared Irsei. I will
      forgive your father's transgressions and those of your friend Surfal in
      exchange for one thing.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">I steeled myself for his request. I was
      sure it would be something I could not do, no matter what the gain.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;I want you to do something your
      father failed to accomplish in his tenure with me here. I want you bring
      me the head of Recnek Shralok and I want 300 platinum as well. I am a
      business man and I am willing to be reasonable. Your life, the life of your
      friend and my gratitude in exchange for those two things. What do you
      say?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;I assume this Recnek Shralok is a
      leader of some kind to the Orcs which plague your North Gate. I assume the
      300 plat is the ransom you asked for on the child my father saved. Your
      offer is generous and therefore I accept. You and I will be at peace until
      this deed is accomplished?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Unless I suspect you have given up
      your quest, you will be safe in my Keep. But I cannot save you from the
      Tier Dal, that is the one thing I cannot give you. They will seek revenge
      for their fallen sister. She was rather expensive and well respected
      amongst her people. You will surely hear from associates at some
      point.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">&quot;Let me worry about the Dark Elves,
      Carson. I will gladly accept the responsibility for my own actions and for
      those of my father. You will have the head of this Recnek Shralok and you
      will get your blood money. Then we are settled and I will move on and go
      about my business.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Carson nodded. &quot;I will miss you,
      Jhared. Your mother must have been a spirited lass. Your father was never
      this bold.&quot; With that he laughed and walked to his desk, waving me
      out of the room. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">I wasn't sure if I had just made a deal
      with the devil or not, but I found Carson remarkably likable for a man who
      wanted to kill me. Under different circumstances I even think I could have
      admired him. I thank Karana those circumstances never came to fruition.</font>
