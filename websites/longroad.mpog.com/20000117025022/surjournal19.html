    Plains of Karana</strong></p>
    </font>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I have never truly appreciated the
      comforts of companionship until this night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Although the trip from Qeynos to Highhold was but a short journey
      considering my final destination lie across the Ocean of Tears I was never
      the less very apprehensive about taking it alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Many dangers await the unprepared traveler on this journey and I
      had already faced several beasts that wished me harmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, my training, experience and tracking skills had
      served their purpose and kept me safe for the past two sunrises.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>With Karana’s help I should be in Highhold by nightfall.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">In the past I had opted to stay near
      the water’s bed and optimize my sneaking abilities but confidence and
      the pressure of time had forced my hand in taking another, more direct
      path.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I would keep to the mountainside and, avoiding the ogre
      hordes, slip past and into northern karana undetected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>What was it that Hager used to say about the best-laid plans of
      giant rats and men?</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">As I passed the area controlled by two
      huge ogre brothers I happened across a very interesting set of tracks.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>To the less trained ranger it might appear as though a hill
      giant was dragging a huge tree behind him but the tracks had a pattern to
      them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It seemed to indented
      into the ground about 3 to 4 inches and every four feet the indention
      would be deeper on one side, then the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Whatever made these tracks was very heavy and moving slowly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If I were to run I could catch up to whatever was making the
      patterns in less than two hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      November skies looked to promise rain so I picked up my pace.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Topping the hill I was met with
      disappointment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
      forty-five minutes of pursuing the tracks they led only to a huge tree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>From a distance it seemed that someone must have drug the tree
      upright and left it in that very spot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Having come such a long way and at such a fast pace I was in need
      of rest so I decided to walk to the tree and rest there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>My tracking ability had already informed me that there were no
      dangers around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once under
      the branches I opened my rations and sat down, hoping to enjoy my meal and
      ponder the mystery of how the tree had moved. And that, my oversized
      friend, is how I came to be in your company.</font></p>
      <hr width="30%" size="1" color="#979362">
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“Very interesting tale, young
      Surfal”, the treant mused, “However I find it difficult to imagine
      that in all your training you never once heard of me or my kind”.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“Tis true, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Until the very moment that you bent down and shook me from my sleep
      I had no knowledge of you” I answered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>“I have had many contacts with druids and shared many tales but
      to this day the knowledge of treants has escaped me”.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="images/surfal-treant.gif" width="420" height="315"></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">&nbsp;“I choose to believe you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Lesser men have run away from the mere sight of me yet you did not,
      why?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the treant asked.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“Not because I did not wish to,
      I’m afraid, but rather because you startled me to the point that my feet
      would not respond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had you
      not spoken words of kindness upon waking me I surely would have passed
      away from fright.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
      responded.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“Many seek me for my knowledge on
      matters or perhaps to challenge me in a fight to the death, I cannot
      recall ever just speaking to an individual for no purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>You are unique, Surfal”.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“I could easily sit with you all day
      but I have matters to attend to elsewhere” I responded.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“True, you have matters to attend to
      in Highhold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Shralok orcs
      are a menace to both humanoid and animal life alike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Take this gift, it will help you in your travels” he whispered.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">As I extended my hand towards his
      branches he gave me a bow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Closer
      inspection proved it to be a bow of superior quality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It felt perfectly right in my hands, as though it was made for me
      and me alone.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">“This
      bow was a gift from a young ranger many, many years ago named Maesyn
      Trueshot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He now resides in
      the treetop city of Kelethin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tell
      him I sent you and that he is to train you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Show him the bow as proof.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      bow is usable only by those who follow the ranger’s path so never stray.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I hope to see you again Surfal, as a champion of Faydark.”</span></font></td>
