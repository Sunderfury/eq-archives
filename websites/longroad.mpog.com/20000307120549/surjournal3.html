<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As dawn broke we roused from our make shift camp and
proceeded to find Cros Treewind. Qeynos Hills covers a very large area and if a
Ranger doesn't want to be found then odds are very likely that you won't find
them. However, I had taken a special interest in my tracking training and felt
very much up for the task. I can just imagine the look on Fyodor's face when I
prove him wrong, prove them all wrong.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By late morning I caught my first glimpse of what might be
Cros Treewind's trail. My concerns were that the trail was leading in a
northwest direction would could take us dangerously close to Black Burrow. Tales
of what Sabertooth clan members have been doing to near by settlements and lone
adventures are well documented. Just as I was about to warn the others of the
possible danger the world went crazy.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first one out of the bushes caught me flush in the lower
back with a cracked staff while two other Gnolls jumped on Jhared from both
sides. I could hear Root begin an incantation when a forth gnoll attacked him
wielding a rusty short sword. The other three were quickly on Fyodor. I have
never heard such loud yelping in my life. I was able to push the gnoll pup back
a couple steps and draw my blade. As I ended my assault on the first gnoll I
spun to see that Jhared had killed his attackers as well and was casting an
enchantment on Root. Fyodor had killed the three on him before any of them even
had a chance to scratch him. As Root's gnoll finally fell Root screamed,
&quot;How in the name of Karana could a Ranger lead us into an ambush setup by
Gnolls. Damn boy, look at the paw prints&quot;.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was devastated. I was so intent on proving my tracking
skills worthy that I completely ignored the obvious tracks in search of the more
obscure ones. Perhaps I would have been better off had I allowed the gnoll to
end my life right there. At least that would have been a quicker death than the
lacerations that Root's words were putting on me. Jhared calmed everyone down
and soon we were on our way. The only thing that can save what little pride I
have left is watching them eat crow as Cros Treewind reveals himself to be the
hero I know he is.</p>

<font size="-1"><font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Barely thirty minutes into the trail and a man covered in
blood ran screaming past us. I have never seen such terror in all my days. He
kept screaming Treewind's name over and over. Jhared and Root tried to stop the
man to administer first aid through healing magic but he was running to fast. We
gathered ourselves together and proceeded slowly down the trail in the direction
from which the man was running. A hundred yards up the trail my heart stopped
and my blood ran cold. A man was lying face down in the dirt beside a rabid
grizzly and on the man's back was carved the words, &quot;A Good Poacher&quot;.
I lost my breakfast.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scene was easy enough to read. Two men, apparently
merchants, had been walking the trail when a grizzly, mad from rabies, attacked
them. It appeared that during the struggle a third set of prints entered the
area and attacked the two men. The tracks were the same ones that I had been
following for the past two days. I suddenly remembered the other man and started
to runoff in the direction that he was headed when he passed us when I heard a
blood-chilling scream. By the time we reached him he was dead, the same words
carved into him as well. No one had to say anything, their silence let me know
what we they were thinking.</p>
<p>That night, after I thought everyone was asleep, I packed my things and
started to leave. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;, Jhared asked. I threw my
ranger tunic at his feet and simply said, &quot;away&quot;. &quot;That would be
easiest, wouldn't it&quot;, he said. What doers he know of easy? My life has
been filled with disappointments and failures. This is the natural conclusion.
Jhared cast some protective magic on me and told me that if I truly wanted to
leave then he wished me well. However, he saw something in me, something bigger.
Chance didn't bring us together, it was Karana. Also, he said, could I really
let Root and Fyodor get the best of me by sneaking out? Or was I going to show
them what a true ranger was like. For a second time, Jhared Irsei has saved my
life. I slept well.</p>
