It was hot, very hot.  I remember this much about that day by the river.  I had been travelling with my mother from some place east.  I can only guess that it was Freeport but I can't understand how a single woman travelling with a child could have crossed that terrain alone.  The point of origin is of little concern, because my life ended, and began, on that day by the river.<p>

The screams are what I remember most, as I was torn from my mother's arms and held while she was savagely beaten to death by a band of wandering ogres and their so called holy shaman.  As she fell to the ground dead they turned their attention to me and I knew I, too, was to die.  The next events still seem a bit hazy but I remember a volley of arrows flying through the air and humans coming out of the woods at my defense.  The ogres were quickly vanquished but my mother was no less dead, I wish I had died there too but Karana was not finished with me yet.  One of the humans picked me up and carried me to the camp of strangers and mended my wounds, if not my spirit.<p>  

The man's name was Dante Hawk, a Ranger from Surefall Glade.  He took me in as if I were his own son and trained me in the ways of the Ranger.  I learned the very basics in how to survive off the land and more importantly, how to protect the land.  As time grew on I had many teachers with the promise of someday being a member of the Ranger's Guild of Surefall Glade.  I was even given the surname of Surfal, which translates from an ancient tongue to Protector of the Glade.  Someday, I will assume the moniker of Surfal Dayspring, but that time is far away and must be earned.  My father, as I have come to call Dante, has seen signs that I am destined to be a part of a greater purpose but of what purpose he knows not.  Karana will guide me, I've been told.  I pray that the greater purpose that I am to be a part of requires the extinction of every ogre on the face of Norath, for this I will do gladly.  My love of the land is matched only by my hatred of the ogre race.<p>

Tomorrow I will go before the Ranger Guildmaster Hager Sureshot and either will be deemed worthy or banished from the Glade, as is the custom of my adopted people.  If it is truly Karana's will, then by tomorrow's eve, my true adventure shall begin.<p>
