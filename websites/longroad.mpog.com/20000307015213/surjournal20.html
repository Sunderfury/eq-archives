      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The encounter with the treant was
      uplifting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My new Trueshot
      bow would prove an invaluable weapon I was certain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I could not wait to show it Binwin. He would be the one to most
      appreciate it for what it truly was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I would even like to show it to Root so that he could see that I
      was truly a ranger worthy of title.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
      those things must wait, for now my attention must be square on trying to
      navigate the less familiar area of East Karana.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I had been in this area before on my
      trips to Rivervale with my Ka-Tet but this was my first time here alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I opted to stop for the night near the large wooden bridge
      and continue on in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
      were many adventurers here and I have learned that there is some safety in
      numbers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I made my camp I
      was joined by a young druid named Encino.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>He shared his summoned food and drink with me and we shared stories
      well into night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At long
      last, when the fire was nearly burned out, he cast a few protective spells
      upon us and welcomed sleep took me instantly.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="1"><strong>Day Eighty-Six - Eastern
      Plains of Karana</strong>
    </font>
      </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I awoke about thirty minutes before
      dawn and gathered my gear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Encino
      did likewise and we parted company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before
      leaving, though, he cast his protective spells upon me and then enchanted
      my legs with Spirit of the Wolf.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      explained that this area was very hostile and the place I was going was up
      a long mountain pass.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Without
      this spell upon me I would most likely die before I reached the pass, or,
      if I did make it that far, whatever was behind me would catch me on the
      long incline.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I thanked him once more and was off.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Encino had spoken the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I learned to recognize many new tracks on my way to Highhold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The lions in West Karana were mere kittens compared to the
      patriarchs here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The snakes
      were twice as long and the wolves were ten times more ferocious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In my haste to cross the land I nearly ran straight into a one eyed
      man that stood nearly as tall as a hill giant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Perhaps it would have been wiser to wait on Jhared or perhaps sent
      word to Valarie for assistance but those options were no longer available
      to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I used my tracking
      skills to the best of my ability and had one encounter that lasted no
      longer than six swings.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The slope in the pass was exactly as
      it was described to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though
      the sun was well past its zenith I decided to make the journey while my
      feet were still blessed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      slope has little to offer in the ways of excitement but went on forever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I was not allowed the luxury of letting my thoughts wander, though,
      for even the smallest missed step would send me over the ridge to a most
      horrible death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After what
      seemed to be an age I at last reached my destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The pass was narrow which would hinder most fighting I was certain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Rather than brave the area at night, I opted for camping at the
      pass entrance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The sounds of
      barking and steel on steel would make sleep hard at best and most probably
      impossible, but Fyodor has taught me that a fighter with tired legs will
      most likely end up taking the rest that never ends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

      ate the last of my muffins from Qeynos and sparingly drank from my last
      flask.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Standing, I cast Skin
      Like Wood and Endure Fire upon myself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Feeling as safe as I was going to get, I closed my eyes, and
      blessed sleep came.</font></span></td>
