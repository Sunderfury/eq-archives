      <p><font size="2">My father had not always been a Hero. I suppose that
      should have been no surprise to me, but it was unexpectedly difficult to
      swallow. My father had begun his career as a militiaman&nbsp; in the
      service of a young Carson McCabe, the Lord of Highhold Keep. He was
      trained to defend Highhold Pass and the Keep therein from the vicious
      assaults of the nearby Shraloks and Mucktails. That in itself seemed no
      surprise. Later on in the journal however, I learned that Carson McCabe
      was not a good man.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">My father's first assignment as a Squad Leader was to
      help raise funds for the militia by kidnapping the children of wealthy
      merchants from the Karanas and from Rivervale. McCabe extorted high
      ransoms for their return. As a young man, my father was only too happy to
      serve his master and having been raised in that environment, never saw the
      evil in his deeds.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">But when a merchant failed to pay the ransom Carson
      demanded, he had ordered the child slaughtered to set an example.
      Something in my father had changed that day, for he raised his sword in
      defense of the child and fought his way free of the Keep. In making his
      exit, he cut Carson deep across the arm, a wound that McCabe never forgot.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">My father made it to the Northern Plains of Karana and
      returned the child to his family. Then he wandered the plains for several
      years, eluding the mercenaries McCabe had looking for him. When things
      seemed to be getting too dangerous, my father headed to Qeynos. There he
      took a post in the Qeynos Guard and his whole life changed. McCabe would
      never move against the Qeynos Guard and things began to settle down. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Years passed and my father tried to reconcile with
      McCabe through letters. McCabe never wrote back. Only once did Father
      suspect McCabe tried to move against him and that was when a vile Dark Elf
      assassin was spotted in the Qeynos area. His name was Jracol Brestiage and
      though they encountered each other directly, Father always suspected
      Brestiage was spying for McCabe. One of his last entries in the journal
      was that he planned to confront Brestiage soon, something I now planned on
      doing myself.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I recounted the journal's content to Master Renic and he
      listened intently. &quot;Jhared, the Knights of Thunder have always
      suspected that McCabe was dirty, but we have never been able to prove
      anything. I can tell you this, though. You had best keep clear of McCabe
      and Highhold Keep. Were he to find out you were your father's son, he
      would surely seek to harm you. Men like McCabe never lose their drive for
      revenge.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I agreed and went back to my room to sleep . I had many
      things to consider.</font></p>
