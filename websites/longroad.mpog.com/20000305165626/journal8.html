<font size="-2">Day </font></b></font><b><font size="-2">Fifty-Four - Qeynos
  Hills/Blackburrow</font></b><p><font size="2">We were supposed to go to Qeynos.
  I had business with the Temple of Thunder, Fyodor was supposed to meet a man
  about buying some equipment and Root had an appointment with Captain Tillin to
  pass on some news from Sheriff Roglio of Rivervale.</font><p><font size="2">But
  when we came up over the Qeynos Hills for the first time in almost a month we
  looked over the city and without a word between us, we turned and headed for
  Blackburrow. I think we are still unprepared to face the civility of the city
  after our days at war. </font><p><font size="2">As we approached the familiar
  horrors of the carved Gnoll head in the side of the great hill, we heard a
  familiar sound. &quot;Ye don't have tha mettle for me, ya snaggletoothed
  furballs!&quot; we all heard as clear as day. We looked down into the entrance
  to Blackburrow and beamed a smile. Grannith was surrounded with Gnolls, at
  least six. With only one other in the fight, Grannith was still taunting his
  opponents. </font><p><font size="2">We charged the Gnolls and with even odds,
  we made quick work of them. Grannith didn't even smile when he saw us.
  &quot;It's about time ya dolts arrived! I been waitin two days for ya to show
  up.&quot; The quiet man who had been fighting with Gran sat down and lowered
  his head, as if meditating. He wore no armor of any kind and fought without
  weapons, so I quickly assumed he was one of the Silent Fist.</font><p><font size="2">&quot;A
  Silent Fist and loud mouthed Dwarf!&quot; I challenged. &quot;Now that is
  funny!&quot;</font><p><font size="2">The monk sat up straight and smiled.
  &quot;Greetings! I take it from your appearance and familiarity with this
  dwarf that you must be Jhared, Fyodor, Root and Surfal. This little juggernaut
  speaks more of you than he does of himself, which is saying quite a lot.&quot;
  Gran grumbled at the mention of his kind words. &quot;I am honored to meet you
  all. My name is Brent. I am indeed a member of the Silent Fist clan and I am
  at your service.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Root smirked, &quot;Great!
  Another tree trunk to block my view.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">We all
  laughed, even Grannith and shared a skin of water and some bread Fyodor had
  bought in West Karana. Grannith explained that he and the young monk were
  headed to the frozen wastes of Everfrost Peaks to search for an elusive
  brewing element the young monk required to fulfill a personal quest. Root
  offered to join them as he also had always wanted to see the White World as
  many called it. Surfal, Fyodor and I were always up for adventure and Qeynos
  seemed a dreadful alternative so we joined in as well.</font><p><font size="2">After
  the meal, we headed back into the familiar darkness of Blackburrow, but
  somehow it didn't seem quite as horrible anymore.</font><p><font size="1"><b>Day
  Fifty-Six - Everfrost Peaks</b></font><p><font size="2">As you cross through
  Blackburrow's twisting tunnels, there is a long, wide passageway which is worn
  by cold winds. We followed that tunnel until we stepped out into a vast cave.
  The nighttime air was freezing cold and the winds were fierce. We decided to
  camp inside the tunnel and embark across the tundra in daytime.</font><p><font size="1"><b>Day
  Fifty-Seven - Everfrost Peaks</b></font><p><font size="2">The frozen canyons
  in the mountains are littered with Polar Bears, White Wolves and Ice Goblins.
  We did some hunting and moved North to through the canyons towards Halas, the
  city of the Barbarians. It was here that Brent said he could obtain an elusive
  and rare brewing component. The tundra was beautiful. The moon light up the
  white snow on the ground and played wild tricks with the eyes. Were it not for
  the biting winds, I would call it a paradise.</font><p>
<center><img src="images/everfrost.gif" width=420 height=315 border=0 alt=""></center>
  <p><font size="2">We
  reached Halas and did some trading with the Barbarians. Fyodor and I bought
  some heavy cloaks, Grannith inquired about an axe and Root and Brent picked up
  some herbs and plants. We decided to camp in the tundra that night as the city
  was so crowded.</font><p><font size="2">Grannith and Root were obviously
  uncomfortable around the giant men and women of the White World. It was an
  amusing sight to see, two little men worming through the feet and legs of
  these powerful people.</font><p><font size="2">We camped in the hills and
  decided that we would try and do some more hunting in the morning.</font><p><font size="1"><b>Day
  Fifty-Eight - Everfrost Peaks</b></font><p><font size="2">Surfal picked up
  some strange tracks just east of our camp and we all decided to follow them.
  As we broke free of the mountain peaks we were awestruck when we looked out
  across the frozen plains. It was like looking at a flat sheet of white glass,
  stretching as far as the eye could see in every direction. It was marvelous to
  behold.</font><p><font size="2">Just then we spotted what was surely the beast
  Surfal was tracking. It was huge and covered in a thick fur. It had giant
  teeth stretching from its mouth and an arm swiveling out from its face. It was
  at once frightening and majestic. I had never seen anything like it and I
  wandered what drunken fit had prompted Karana to create such a strange beast.
  As we looked it over, it opened its mouth and roared. The sound echoed across
  the plains.</font><p>
<center><img src="images/mammoth.gif" width=420 height=315 border=0 alt=""></center>
  <p><font size="2">&quot;Now that is what I call a
  trophy!&quot; Grannith said, slapping our shields with his axe.</font><p><font size="2">Surfal
  looked it over, &quot;You know...I bet we could take that beast if we worked
  as a team.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">I gulped and looked to Fyodor. More
  than any of us, he would be the best judge of what we could or could not
  handle. I am not sure if I was excited or terrified as I waited for his
  decision.</font><p><font size="2">&quot;Move us up on its flank, Surfal.&quot;
  Fyodor adjusted his armor and tightened his shield straps. &quot;Grannith and
  I will get its attention from the front. You four focus your efforts from the
  sides and behind.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">We all smiled and set out to
  stalk the mightiest beast we had ever seen.</font><p><font size="2">It took
  almost half an hour to sneak up close enough to it to attack without drawing
  attention to ourselves. Once everyone was in position, we waited for Fyodor's
  signal. Once the shield waved back and forth giving the sign , we all charged
  from our hiding spot and tore into the beast. Much as I expected, it swung its
  mighty teeth like a sword, slashing at Fyodor and Grannith. As we continued
  the fight, the beast had even more surprises. It used the strange arm-like
  appendage on its face to pick Grannith up off the ground and throw him twenty
  feet into the snow. He hit hard and for a moment I feared we would not make
  it.</font><p><font size="2">But Gran stood back up and charged like a bull.
  Adrenaline surged through our veins and we fought on. In the end, it was Brent
  who delivered the final blow, a precise kick to the huge creature's throat.
  When it fell to the ground, it shook the earth. We camped and began to
  consider the amount of meat and hides we could retrieve from the beast. </font><p><font size="2">&quot;I
  want the big teeth,&quot; Fyodor asked. &quot;Those are a phenomenal trophy
  and if no one has any objections I would like to take them back to Qeynos with
  me.&quot;</font><p>
<center><img src="images/surf-gran.gif" width=420 height=315 border=0 alt=""></center>
  <p><font size="2">We all agreed and helped Fyodor cut the
  giant bones from the beast.</font><p><font size="2">It was a remarkable hunt
  and one I shall not forget. When we reached Halas, to sell off the excess meat
  and hides we were told by a trader that the beast we slew was called a
  Mammoth. We all laughed and thanked him for the information. As we were
  walking away he caught sight of the teeth Fyodor has strapped to his back. He
  started laughing and blurted out, &quot;Oh dear. I didn't realize it was only
  a calf! Well, you outlanders should be careful if you carry those tusks in the
  frozen plains. This little calf's mother is going to be looking for it and she
  won't be happy to see those tusks on your back.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">&quot;You
  mean that thing was a baby!&quot; I shouted.</font><p><font size="2">&quot;Oh
  yes, a full grown Mammoth is significantly larger and ten times as
  deadly.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">We all thought back to the fierce battle
  and the tremendous accomplishment we thought we had attained. Fyodor
  unstrapped the tusks and threw them into the snow.&nbsp; We all turned and
  headed for Blackburrow.</font><p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
