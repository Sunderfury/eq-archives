  <br>
  Mordent ran a tailor shop in the Foreign Quarter of Neriak known as the Silk
  Underground. He was quiet and worn, it was obvious that he had seen too much
  of the world. He seemed very capable of whatever act forced him from his
  people to seek exile amongst those that despised him. Gath spoke of him once,
  warning me not to visit with him. Humans didn't frighten me however. They are
  brutish, but weak.<br>
  <br>
  It was no surprise to any of my classmates that I would defy my teacher's
  wishes and visit Mordent on a regular basis. After all, a young Wizard of my
  linage needed to look good and I did have money to burn. I learned early on
  that the decaying undead produced an important component for Necromantic
  spells. I would join groups of warrior pups, offering my services and asking
  for nothing in return save some measly scraps of bone. I made one plat for
  every 20 chips. I had amassed a good deal of wealth beyond that of my
  classmates normal allowance.<br>
  <br>
  And so I would find an excuse to visit Mordent almost every week. First I
  needed a new jacket. Then a cloak for traveling. I brought him my boots for
  repair, not bothering to clean the mud off them first. Mordent himself never
  wore the fine silks or the warm pelts that he labored over for his customers.
  I enjoyed tormenting Mordent, it was so easy. He had a lame leg and he limped.
  I would always ask for something across the room, just to make him hobble. But
  despite all my venom, Mordent always greeted me with a smile. He always seemed
  interested in my studies. He always remembered his place. I admit I looked
  forward to my visits.<br>
  <br>
  One day I snuck into the Silk Underground to check on some shirts Mordent was
  tailoring for me. A fellow pupil of mine, D'jen came along. D'jen and I had
  talked earlier about Mordent and the games I would play on the old cripple. He
  had come for a look, despite the trouble he could get in should he be caught.
  Mordent was there to greet me with a smile. He limped from the back with my
  shirts and another bundle wrapped in a plain brown paper.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Good morning young Dubels.&quot; He said, handing me the shirts.
  &quot;I'll not charge you for the cleaning&quot; He kept the second package in
  clear sight, but did not bring attention to it.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;What's this you carry Mordent.&quot; I asked pointing to the bundle.
  &quot;Is it for me?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Mordent smiled, &quot;That depends son. Word is that you've just reached the
  5th tier and that burned down a young Kodiak this morning.&quot; He limped
  back behind the counter. &quot;But that doesn't sound like you, Dubels. That
  sounds like man's work.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  D'jen jumped, surprised to hear someone like Mordent insult a member of the
  Spurned. But I was intrigued. All the time I'd spent kicking this tailor
  around, it was nice to see him bite back.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;I could just as easily burn a down a man, Mordent.&quot; I reminded him.
  &quot;I can call flames right out of the air and send them on you. Would you
  like that ?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Mordent smiled, and threw the paper bundle to me. &quot;For you, my dark
  brooding young fiend.&quot; he cackled. &quot;One of the many things I've
  gathered as I've aged. A friend of mine wore it once. he was an enchanter. He
  died 20 years ago and I've no use for it.&quot; I caught the package smiling.
  Mordent had never been afraid of me as I thought. I found a new respect for
  him.<br>
  <br>
  Under the plain brown paper lay an intricate pattern of embroidered crimson
  and violet atop a jet black robe. D'jen's jaw dropped as I discarded the
  wrappings and my tunic to don the flowing black robe. It danced against my
  skin, it seemed alive. I felt more powerful at that moment than I ever had
  before. Carrying a grin,&nbsp; I turned to a full length mirror to admire
  myself. Behind me D'jen reflection was visibly angry. He started to say
  something but instead stormed out. Mordent didn't wait for me to thank him. He
  picked up the wrapping and carefully folded it as he walked into the back
  room.<br>
  <br>
  The next day, I was purposely late to morning meditation. This way, everyone
  would be expecting my arrival in hopes to turn the screws on me for tardiness.
  Instead, I would turn the screws on them by displaying a Wizard's robe the
  likes of which even my master would envy. However, despite my plans not one
  initiate bothered to look up when I entered the room. In fact, they seemed
  desperate NOT to look at me. All save Gath, who motioned me follow him
  downstairs. As I passed him, D'jen found the bravery to look up at me and
  sneer.<br>
  <br>
  Gath spoke softly so as not to disturb his pupils upstairs. In fact his voice
  never raised higher than a whisper. &quot;Do you take your studies here
  seriously initiate?&quot; His hands we clasped behind his back.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Yes master.&quot; I responded, &quot;very much so.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;And you wish to continue with us? You wish to stay&nbsp; a member of the
  Spurned?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Yes master. I do.&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Gath turned and walked directly beside me, my gaze locked forward. He placed
  his lips almost against my ear when he said, &quot;Mordent Tather is dead. I
  had him killed this morning. You will never defy me or my rules again. Is that
  understood?&quot;<br>
  <br>
  I could not speak. But I must have responded for he nodded and said
  &quot;Good.&quot; Gath headed towards the stairs. &quot;Take a moment then
  return and meditate with the others. We've much work ahead of us today.&quot;
  He stopped and turned, looking me up and down.<br>
  <br>
  &quot;Nice robe.&quot;<br>
