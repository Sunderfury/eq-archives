  <p>I awoke on bare rock badly bruised. I remember seeing the gnoll pup
  standing in the middle of hollow tree and yapping at me. There was no need to
  alert Fyodor of this, it was only a pup after all. As I lunged for him he
  sidestepped and I fell through the false earth. I don’t know if &quot;false
  earth&quot; is the term I should use but it seems to fit. Now I am all alone
  down here. Karana help me, I fear the worst. Fyodor’s words haunt me now,
  &quot;They are a crafty lot&quot;. Why didn’t I listen?</p>
  <p>Shouting out would be a very bad idea at this point. If the Gnolls were not
  aware of my presence before they would be if I yelled. Besides, I am ranger
  and rangers track. Surely I can track my way out of here, can’t I? As I
  turned around my heart stopped. The room was scattered with corpses. Dwarf,
  gnome human, elven, and even troll bodies littered the floor. Would I meet the
  same fate? I started the journey out.</p>
  <p>Staying close to water’s edge I made my way around a bend and saw a door
  on a ledge up above me. It was accessible by a wooden bridge across the water.
  I started to sneak across, tracking anything that was close. As I reached the
  other side I crept up to the bridge and snuck across. I listened to the door
  and heard no sound, placing my hand on the door I started to turn to the knob
  when a hand reached around and clasped over my mouth, jerking me back and
  almost off the bridge. I went for my sword but I was on my back before I knew
  what hit me. Looking up I saw the weary face of Fyodor, and he looked
  horrible.</p>
  <p>&quot;Have you any idea what is on the other side of that door? The gnoll
  commander and his two personal elite guards!&quot; We continued down the
  waters edge till we reached the end. At this point we dove under the waters
  surface and swam through a small opening. As we emerged on the other side I
  grabbed Fyodor’s arm and halted him. &quot;I am tracking two patrolling
  Gnolls&quot; I exclaimed. We snuck behind them and finished them off with
  ease. We looted their corpses and found coin minted in Qeynos. What were
  Gnolls doing with Qeynos coin?</p>
  <p>We fought our way out of Blackburrow’s pit and finally rejoined some
  other adventurers that were fighting some burly Gnolls and a couple of
  guarding Gnolls. Still, I find no evidence of a conspiracy. Fyodor’s
  training has become invaluable. I have made numerous kills without him, though
  I am sure he kept a close eye on me all the same. We camped on ledge over
  looking a pool. We alternated keeping watch but neither of us really slept.
  Tomorrow, we continue the search.</p>
