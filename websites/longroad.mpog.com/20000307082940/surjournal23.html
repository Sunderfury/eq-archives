      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Walking to the orc-controlled pass and
      join up with other mercenaries was just a short distance from where the
      bandit battle took place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately
      we happened upon to humans that were apparently grouped together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Sanchez and Cyprusdraco were a friendly enough pair from Freeport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Sanchez was a healer and not too shabby a one at that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>His skills in combat were not near those of Jhared’s but they
      served him well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I had barely had time to introduce myself when a wave of orcs
      attacked from a ridge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
      were upon us at lightning speeds and well armed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The orcs in the misty thicket were
      unorganized and not well equipped, that was not the case here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I suppose that secretly I had hoped that these would be the pawns
      and centurions that I had fought before but I was very wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>These orcs stood a good two feet above me in size.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I drew my bow and let two arrows fly as they advanced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Sanchez cast a spell rooting one in his tracks but the other two
      were still advancing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
      replaced the bow with my tomahawk and swung with all my might.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I buried it deep inside the orc mercenary’s gut as Cyprusdraco
      dropped another one behind me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      third mercenary, now free from Sanchez spell advanced on his positioned
      and called for support.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An
      Orc Warrior crashed down from hiding and destroyed a young elven mage not
      more than four paces from me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
      yellow mage robe smeared with his blood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I turned to attack but my shaman friend had already taken the beast
      down.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I drew the barbed whip
      that Isabo had given me and snapped it into the orc mercenary’s flesh as
      it began to pummel Sanchez.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Surprisingly, I was able to control it very well with my left
      hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With my right I
      continued to attack with the tommy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cyprusdraco
      laid the killing blow to the orcs skull.</font></p>

      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">We looted the orcs and found several
      pieces of armor and a bronze weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The strange part is that these orcs were carrying currency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Whoever was behind this was paying well.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We congratulated one another on a fine job and settled into
      position for the next wave.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The day continued on much the same
      way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All total our grouped
      killed 13 orcs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
      only two scalps were salvageable but the items these creatures were
      carrying would be a worth a lot to a vendor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>We decided to go back to the keep and celebrate with some ale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I was told that they might even have some of the outlawed
      Blackburrow stout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I wish
      Fyodor were here to witness this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
      think even he would be proud of me.</font></td>
