Yesterday was rather, unsettling.  My savior from the undead has turned out to be a mixed blessing.  Jhared has with him two traveling companions who are rather free in their opinions.  It seems that Rangers have little respect in the woods outside of Surefall Glade and worse yet, some are even regarded as murderers. <p> 

Fyodor seems to be a strong fighter with a very quick hand, far quicker than any elf I have ever seen.  His fighting skill seems unequaled to any save Hager himself.  The third member of this band is the Halfling Root, though I didn't know his name at first.  I can't believe that I was sent to find this Halfling.  What's more, I can't believe that I could ever learn anything from him.  He is rude and very emotional.  I think that for now, I will keep it a secret that I was sent to find him and study by his side.  The puzzling part is that he seems to know very little in the ways of the druid, as though he has been on this path only a short while.  I will say this, though, he may be small but he carries a very large stick.<p>

I fear that perhaps my first impression with this trio did not go well at all.  It seems that they hunt the local wild life and have a distrust of Rangers.  I explained that unless they are hunting for sport they have little to fear.  In fact, if they were attacked by one of the rabid animals in the area then most likely a Ranger would run to their aid.  Perhaps they would even be graced with aid of the great Cros Treewind or Holly Windstalker.  You would have thought I killed someone…<p>

Jhared said something that I still can't believe, "Surfal, here in the Hills, your heroes are considered to be villains of the highest order. Short of the murderous Tovax Marr and the nefarious Varsoon, there are no two worse creatures in all of the Hills. I am sorry to be so blunt but I fear you do not have the whole story on those two."<p>

My anger and shock got the best of me and I started to draw my long sword, but, well, to be honest, that is my last memory before waking.  I must study Fyodor, he is one that can teach me plenty.
