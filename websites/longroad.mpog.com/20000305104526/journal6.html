<b><font size="-2">Twenty-Eight - Rivervale</font></b><p><font size="2">We found
  Grannith at the Fool's Gold drinking and singing in Dwarven fashion. It was a
  joyous meeting for Grannith and I and after a few pints we all were singing at
  the top of our lungs. Although you wouldn't think it, Fyodor has a lovely
  singing voice.</font><p><font size="1"><b>Day Twenty-Nine - Rivervale</b></font><p><font size="2">I
  am not completely sure how this happened, as most of the events of last night
  are hazy and unclear. All I know for sure is that I woke up this morning in
  the barracks of the Rivervale Wall Squad. Near me on similarly short and
  unsupporting beds were Fyodor, Surfal, Grannith and Root.&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2">The
  accommodations had little effect on Grannith and Root, but Surfal, Fyodor and
  I were desperately trying to straighten out the kinks in our spines from the
  torturous little beds. &quot;Tunare bless me! My skull hasn't ringed this
  loudly since that run in with the Gnoll Commander in Blackburrow,&quot; Surfal
  moaned as he tried to stretch.</font><p><font size="2">&quot;What are doing in
  this ridiculously small hovel and where the hell did I get this silly
  badge?&quot; Fyodor barked.</font><p><font size="2">Root stood proudly before
  us and shined the badge he wore on his sleeve. &quot;Gentlemen, you are now
  official members of the Rivervale Wall! Normally you would have gone through
  months of training and no small amount of proving yourself before ever
  achieving this fine honor but desperate times call for desperate measures!
  Rivervale needs help and is greatly in your debt for your volunteering to help
  defend the town from the Runnyeye Goblins!&quot;</font><p><font size="2">I
  managed a weak, &quot;Volunteered?&quot; through my hung over haze.</font><p><font size="2">&quot;Don't
  ya remember, ya lanky dolts!&quot; Grannith shouted. &quot;The mayor and the
  sheriff came inta tha bar last night and ya all signed up like ya was expectin
  to be paid or something.&quot; Grannith was enjoying this. &quot;Myself, I
  signed up for the glory of it!&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Fyodor leveled a
  gaze in my direction. &quot;You know, as the number of these smaller types
  multiplies, the amount of misery doubles.&quot; I managed a passing smirk. I
  was glad to help the people of Rivervale, but this seemed an odd beginning to
  a bold adventure.</font><p><font size="2">Root ran a smoothing cloth over his
  staff and said, &quot;We are to report to Deputy Budo at the Wall in about an
  hour. Do you guys need anything before then?&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Fyodor,
  Surfal and I all spoke the words in unison, &quot;I NEED A DRINK!&quot;</font><p><b><font size="1">Day
  Thirty-Two - Misty Thicket</font></b><p><font size="2">The last few days are a
  bloodstained blur. The fighting in the Thicket has been unceasing. There are
  three rotations of the Wall Squadron working in 8 hour shifts and soon I fear
  we will be forced to abandon rest altogether.</font><p><font size="2">Fyodor
  has often worked three or four shifts at a time, as he has realized the amount
  of confidence his presence brings to the others. Grannith hasn't slept at all
  that I know of, opting to stay in the thick of it until he runs back for a
  quick meal and a flagon. Surfal and I have tried to pace ourselves. My talents
  are best used in the infirmary, tending to the wounded and using my magics to
  strengthen and enhance the warriors as they enter the field.&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2">I
  have never pushed myself this hard with my magic, preferring normally to only
  use it in times of absolute necessity. Unfortunately for me, this situation
  knows no boundary to necessity.</font><p><font size="2">Several other
  volunteers have arrived from surrounding areas. I even saw an Ogre smashing
  Gobs near the Runnyeye entrance. I had never seen an Ogre eat before and it
  took me several hours to remember why I ever wanted to eat&nbsp; again. Ogres
  have refined the fine art of eating and fighting at once, preying on their
  victims for sustenance in battle. It is a disgusting practice but I know that
  different cultures breed different customs and I have tried to look beyond it.</font><p><font size="2">I
  have found that despite their dimunitive size, the Halflings of Rivervale are
  a brave and willful people. Even Grannith has uttered fine words of their
  courage, something of a rarity for our feisty little Dwarf companion.</font><p><font size="2">Grannith
  and Fyodor are certainly in their element here. Though they are obviously
  tired and fatigued, they have proven to be an incredible source of confidence
  and inspiration for the Wall Squadron. We have slaughtered more Gobs than I
  ever dreamed I would see in a lifetime. Our casualties have not been too bad,
  as a small group of clerics and shaman have been working non-stop to ensure,
  but the Gobs keep coming.</font><p><font size="2">If they do not give our
  defenders a break soon, we may lose this battle.</font><p><font size="1"><b>Day
  Thirty-Five - Misty Thicket</b></font><p><font size="2">Although I should be exhilarated,
  I am too exhausted to celebrate. We have finally turned back the Gobs of
  Runnyeye. In the end we proved too well defended in this Wall Outpost for them
  to overcome. Grannith fought almost every single hour of the battle for six
  straight days and Fyodor almost matched him, slepping only a few times. I am
  simply in awe of their stamina.</font><p><font size="2">Surfal proved to be
  most useful as a means of predicting attacks and tracking down wounded. He was
  personally responsible for dispatching most of supply routes and has earned
  Fyodor and Grannith's deep respect for his stalwart resilience.</font><p><font size="2">I
  thank Karana we all lived. The actual loss of life amongst the townsfolk and
  deputies was surprisingly low but I fear another day of the siege would have
  claimed more than the past six as everyone was at their breaking point.</font><p><font size="2">It
  took seven hours to calm Grannith from his berserker-like rage after the
  battle and now he is sleeping like a kitten. I wouldn't be surprised if he
  slept for three days.</font><p><font size="1"><b>Day Thirty-Seven - Misty
  Thicket</b></font><p><font size="2">It has been two days and there have been
  no more sieges. It appears we have turned the Gobs back for a while. The
  Sheriff explained that he expects another month or more to pass before the
  Gobs gather the resources for another invasion.</font><p><font size="2">Sheriff
  Roglio is a hellish man and I have found that I take his orders as quickly and
  easily as I do those of Master Wolten at the Temple of Thunder. He has earned
  every scar on his craggy little face and I am quite sure I do not want to know
  where they all came from.</font><p><font size="2">If the next few nights prove
  his theory correct, we will likely head back towards Qeynos. I have much to
  report to Sir Wolten and I feel this message is deserving of a personal
  delivery. Root is as jolly as I have ever seen him. In reward for his fine
  service during the siege, he was awarded a Squad Ring, which is apparently a
  symbol of honor amongst his people. He says it carries powerful magic as well.</font><p><font size="2">When
  we first arrived I was so shaken by the dangers of the trip from Qeynos I
  feared I would never be able to return. Now, amusingly enough, I look forward
  to the trip as I would a spring vacation.</font><p>&nbsp;
