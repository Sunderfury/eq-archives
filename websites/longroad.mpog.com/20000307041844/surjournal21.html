    Pass</strong></p>
    </font>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Gnolls dropped with one slice of my
      blade or one swing of my mace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
      soon as one would attack me I would just as quickly defeat it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>When it came to hunting gnolls outside of Qeynos I had honed my
      skill and was prepared for anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>This is not Qeynos.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">As soon as I rounded the first bend in
      Highhold Pass a gnoll soothsayer assaulted me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The creature stood about two feet taller than myself but I have
      fought taller opponents in the past and Fyodor had taught me well in the
      art of defending blows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As it
      started to cast it’s spells I kicked him in his knee effectively
      breaking its concentration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My
      mace struck true twice, once in his arm and the next to his ribs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The cracking sound was glorious, but short-lived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The spell caster twirled his hands in the air and chanted something
      in gnollish and my feet were rooted to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In my initial panic I let down my guard and the gnoll bashed
      my head with his great staff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Had
      my feet not been rooted I surely would have fallen back.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">His second blow glanced off my tunic
      and I responded with a thrust that went wide left.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The gnoll’s next three punches hit hard and consecutively in my
      neck and shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thgough my
      throat was on fire I managed to get off a Flame Lick spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>With the soothsayere slightly easier to hit I connected with a low
      slash to his legs and then it happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I looked up hoping to see his face twisted in pain just as he got
      off a spell that sound like an explosion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>My skin was covered in flames and my eyes burned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The air seemed to be sucked out of my lungs.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Though my eyes were clouded I had full
      functionality of my hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through
      the barks of the gnol and the sounds of his magic cracking the air I could
      also hear a loud thumping noise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Within
      seconds the air was still and the smoke cleared.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Standing before me was a vision of beauty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Was this a messenger of Karana or Tunare come to take me to the
      next plane.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“So, are you getting to sit there
      with that stupid look on your face or are you going to follow me to
      safety”, the lady asked.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I staggered to my feet and cast minor
      healing on myself a few times so that I would at least be able to keep
      pace with her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She asked me
      if I would verbally commit to following her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Once I agreed she began to sing the most hypnotic song.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Although I consider myself to be a fast runner I realized just how
      slow I really was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Keeping
      pace with the lady was easy but our speed had to be twice that of normal
      men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">She led me to the Keep entrance and
      asked me too verbally state that I would disband with her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I did as she requested and her music seemed to no longer affect me.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“Who are you?” I asked<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“You may call me Isabo for now, what
      are you doing here?” she asked.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“Are
      you one with McCabe or do you seek the princess?”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“Lady Isabo, I know not what you
      speak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I am merely here to
      assist the citizens in their fight against the orcs and gnolls.”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“Let me see your weapon” she
      demanded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“This sword and
      mace or perhaps the shoddiest craftsmanship I have ever seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Follow me to my strong box and don’t be slow, I have other
      matters to attend to besides saving wood elves from there own
      ambitions.”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">She led me into the keep and down a
      short flight of stairs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
      turned to the right and saw a banker wielding a scimitar.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“What sort of banker needs to be so
      well armed, Isabo?”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“You are new here, Surfal, but you
      will learn quickly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All is
      not as it seems and very soon you will have to make a stand with one
      faction or the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There
      is no middle road.”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“How do you know my name?” I
      asked.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“I know much for I have been around
      longer than you and I usually listen instead of speak all the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I am going to give you something that should assist you in your
      travels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a polished
      granite tomahawk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I removed
      it from the severed hand of a gnoll.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Its brother has one just like it and will no doubt be coming to
      claim this one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I may ask for
      this back someday so you best guard it with your life.”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I tried to speak but she cut me off.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">“Why do you carry a shield?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Has your guild master not taught you the art of dual wield?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Never the less, I have a spare whip that you can practise the art
      of dual wield on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Need I say
      that the exact rule applies, I will be asking for these back some day so
      guard my possessions with your life.”<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">I started to thank her for the arms
      but before I could she hit her drum and was gone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Could Tunare herself be as beautiful as this lady could?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Her voice was that of an angel and she moved like water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It was obvious that she had seen many battles and lived to tell the
      tale but yet she remained very feminine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I can only hope that Karana or Tunare allow me to see her once
      more, the fair Isabo.</font></td>
