      Darkpaws</big></p>
    <font SIZE="2"><p></font><font size="1"><strong>Day Eighty-Three - Qeynos</strong></p>
    </font>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The bark seemed to echo throughout the
      entire zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though my
      understanding of the gnoll language was very limited I was able to make a
      few words and phrases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
      would appear that one of the leaders of clan Darkpaw had entered the area
      around Qeynos and was intent on slaughtering new, raw recruits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If that were indeed his intention, perhaps he would be unprepared
      to meet someone such as myself, at least, that is what I kept telling
      myself.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The tracks were overly easy to follow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>To an unseasoned ranger it would seem as though one gnoll was
      making the tracks but there signs that led me to believe that there were
      in fact two walking in one another’s tracks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Light was almost completely gone now but the signs couldn’t have
      been clearer if it were in the middle of the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Another loud bark, followed closing by what seemed to be dwarven
      screams, and I knew I was close.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I could not swear to it, but I believe the barks were
      boasting that his name was Fippy Darkpaw and he was here to extract his
      revenge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I quickened my pace.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">About a 100 paces ahead of me I saw
      the gnoll, fresh from his kill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
      was facing off to the right of me, which left me a clear shot with my bow.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I drew the string and let my initial arrow fly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It struck true into the gnoll’s arm and with uncanny quickness
      and agility he was on me before I could draw another arrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="images/fippy.gif" width="420" height="315"></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The smell on his fur was sickening.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In his right hand he swung a long sword, which looked very
      tarnished.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Though the speed
      at which he closed the distance between was impressive he skills with a
      sword were very lax.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was
      easily able to dodge his blows while landing a majority of my own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The moon was not full enough for my shiny brass shield to be used
      as a tool but it wasn’t needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
      quickly as it began the fight ended.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The gnoll was dead at my feet and I hardly broken a sweat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">They say that with experience comes
      knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They also told me
      in my training that you must learn from your mistakes or you are doomed to
      repeat them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Karana, when
      will I learn from mine?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In my
      excitement over dropping this gnoll I completely forgot about the tracks
      and my discovery that there were in fact two Gnolls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>If I had remembered then a longsword wouldn’t have cut into my
      lower back.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">As I fell to the ground I heard a low
      growl and the broken words, “I am Nixx Darkpaw, and I will feast on your
      flesh”.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><img border="0" src="images/nixx.gif" width="420" height="315"></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">His sword came slashing down again but
      this time I was able to roll away and avoid the razor sharp blade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I sprung to my feet and quickly cast Skin Like Wood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>His next blow connected with my shield but the force of it was
      still great enough to knock me off balance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I tried to dodge his next blow but it connected squarely with my
      upper thigh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My instincts
      told me to attack him low so I obeyed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>My long sword&nbsp; found his flesh and opened a wound from his
      knee to his paw.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I dodged his
      next blow and long sword found his groin and sliced into him about five
      inches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">As blood gushed from his wounds he
      fell to his knees yelping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
      raised my blade for a final time and ended his life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>I checked his corpse and found nothing of value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The corpses on the ground reminded me of the times I spent in
      Blackburrow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I had hoped that
      the raids would have come to an end by now considering the damage that had
      been done to the their home but it seems I was foolish to believe such a
      thing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When last I was there Fyodor had tried to convince me that we
      should attack the gnoll commander in his very chamber.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>At that time I was worried of the guardians and elite Gnolls that
      he kept by his side but the time for such concerns was maybe past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The need in Highhold was indeed urgent and I still have not
      journeyed to Greater Faydark to meet with the Champions Of Faydark but
      this is important as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
      I will send word to Fyodor once I have completed these tasks and ask for
      his assistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been
      too long since I have shared ale with my mentor and I feel he will be more
      than eager to assist me.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">The walk back to the Qeynos gate was
      short.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I know where my
      destiny lies but the path has many forks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>It is urgent that I find Jhared and speak of these developments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Aye, we have much to discuss indeed.</font></td>
