<font size="-1">Added a new Journal from newcomer <a href="tales/javarahl/index.html">Javarahl</a> to the <a href="tales/index.html">Tales from the Long Road</a>. Thanks for coming on board!</font><p>

<font size="-2"><b>Monday, July 19th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">I have a lot of material to add today. Before I can do that, however, I need to make some adjustments to the structure of the site.<p>Also, a small continuity flaw was brought to my attention over the weekend. In the latest installment of my journal, I made a small change to rectify that problem.<p>I want to thank all my "Tales" contributors for their wonderful work. With my computer out of service, they have maintained a very steady stream of stories to keep my spirits up. If I can't play, at least I can live vicariously through their adventures.<p>
There is a new <a href="journal.html">Journal</a> from Surfal online, as well as a series of new works from <a href="tales/phinigel/index.html">Phinigel</a> and <a href="tales/jamas/index.html">Jamas</a> in the Tales from the Long Road area.</font><p>

<font size="-2"><b>Friday, July 16th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">Added a new Journal from newcomer Dnaice to the <a href="tales/index.html">Tales from the Long Road</a>.<p>By accident, my son spilled ice water across my laptop, so until I get it repaired (will take about two weeks) I will be unable to play. The updates will continue but I lost a lot of screenshots and other important stuff with that hard drive, so please be patient.<p>I just added another newcomer to the <a href="tales/index.html">Tales from the Long Road</a> section, Phinigel Autropos. Thanks a lot to everyone who is contributing!</font><p>

<font size="-2"><b>Wednesday, July 14th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">I posted a new <a href="journal.html">Journal</a> entry myself this morning. Sorry for the delay in my writing, but I have been swamped with other things.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Tuesday, July 13th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">Jamas added another Journal to the <a href="tales/index.html">Tales from the Long Road</a>. I also added Jamas' portrait to the Cast section.<p>
We also have a new Long Roader named Martyn De'Lantara who added the first of their Journals to the site today.<p>
Plus, two new Journal entries from Surfal including the Trial at Surefall Glade.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Monday, July 12th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">I have been overwhelmed with the response to the Long Road Journals. Every day I am greeted with a full mailbox and I couldn't be happier. In the game, I regularly receive well wishes and invitations to group thanks to the site and again, it is a wonderful feeling.<p>
Over the weekend, I was confronted with a very unique and different request. A monk named Jamas not only wanted to play but also wished to submit a Journal for the Long Road Journals site. To be honest, I had never considered a situation like this one and I was very flattered.<p>
So I have added the new <a href="tales/index.html">Tales from the Long Road</a> which will be used to add new and exciting Journals from other travelers from the Long Road. Thanks Jamas and keep them coming!<p><p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Friday, July 9th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">Two new Journal entries from me and one new Journal from Surfal.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Thursday, July 8th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">I added several new trophies to the Trophy Case and some pictures to some of Surfal's Journals. I also changed the format of the Screenshots Archive so that it will load much more easily for low speed connections.<p>In the late afternoon, I added a new Journal from Surfal.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Wednesday, July 7th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">I added a new Journal entry from Surfal.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Tuesday, July 6th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">I added pictures of Valarie and Grannith to the Cast section.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Thursday, July 1st 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">Three new journal entries from Surfal and a bunch of new Trophies for the Trophy Case!<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Monday, June 28th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">Sorry for the long delay in updates. There were a whole host of forces which contributed to the delay, and I will be updating a lot of material today and tomorrow to make up for it.<p></font>
<font size="-1">I just added new Cast pics and a Journal entry from Surfal.<p>
I also added a new Letters section, which features correspondence and pictures from the mighty Grimtreacle Grak.</font><p>

<font size="-2"><b>Tuesday, June 7th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">Finally got a good screenshot portrait of Surfal for the Cast section.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Monday, June 7th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">I added the Trophy Case this morning and should have the latest Journal entry in place by this afternoon, as well as the new Quests section.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Friday, June 4th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">I added a Screenshot Archive and a Cast of Characters page this morning, as well as a new Journal entry.<p>Surfal has also added a new Journal entry.<p></font>


<font size="-2"><b>Thursday, June 3rd 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">I completed stage one of the redesign of the site today. I hope to continue to improve the look and feel as I go along.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Friday, May 28th 1999<br></b></font>
<font size="-1">Surfal Dayspring, one of my strongest allies in the game has asked to add his own journal to the site. Surfal is a very entertaining and wild-eyed Half Elf so I am sure his stories will amuse you. I am hoping several of my other cohorts will join Surfal and I in bringing new content to the site.<p>Expect to see a lot of new material on Tuesday at the very latest.<p></font>

<font size="-2"><b>Friday, May 28th 1999<br></b></font>
