    </font><font SIZE="2"><p>Midday, maybe later&#133;Karana, I need sleep. Morning came all
    too soon and the ocean voyage was every bit as horrible as I had feared it to be. Had it
    not been for Jhared&#146;s tales of Drosco and his horrible fate I would surely have
    perished on this journey. I am sure I would have either fallen overboard or lost my entire
    insides over the side. What could I have done to displease Karana so much that he would
    take away my home then send me on this voyage? I can only prepare myself for the coming
    days. I must admit the lure of treasure has a profound effect on me.</p>
    <p>The first shades of nightfall were caressing the bow of the ship when the island was
    first in view. I had actually been successful in keeping down some rations and a little
    bit of water. It was all I could do to not jump overboard and swim for the blessed ground.
    It was obvious from afar that the island was no bigger than half the size of Surefall
    Glade but land was land and I was prepared to enjoy every bit of it. It was Jhared who
    brought reality crushing down on top of me.</p>
    <p>&quot;Tell me what you see.&quot; he stated.</p>
    <p>Sand, trees and a few huts with a scattering of a feline race that appears to walk on
    two legs.</p>
    <p>&quot;Tell me what you don&#146;t see&quot; he commanded.</p>
    <p>I had no idea what he was getting at and I was certain that I wasn&#146;t going to like
    it. &quot;I don&#146;t know, Jhared, I guess I don&#146;t see any sunken ships&quot; I
    answered.</p>
    <p>&quot;We have no idea what is on this island for I have never been here and by your own
    admission you have never traveled this far west. We are going to a strange place that we
    know little about. If something lives here that is beyond our abilities, how do you expect
    to survive the assault?&#146;</p>
    <p>&quot;I will flee to the guards as you and Fyodor have shown me&quot;, I quickly
    responded.</p>
    <p>&quot;Really, and where on this small island do you suppose such guards will be?&quot;
    he whispered.</p>
    <p>For the first time I saw the island for what it really was. This was no paradise off
    the coast of Qeynos, it was an isolated land mass controlled by the only law that truly
    matters, the survival of the fittest. My heart sank.</p>
    <p>As the boat docked and we stepped off I noticed one thing immediately, small swirls in
    the sand. Had I not been so upset over Jhared&#146;s words I would have noticed the
    glowing orbs sooner, I suppose. At any rate, the tracks told me all I needed to know.
    There were wisps here. There were a lot of wisps here! To make matters worse I heard the
    sound of moaning and steel clashing to the east, the same moans that the undead Drosco had
    made. I turned toward the peer but the ship had sailed, and our fate was sealed. Live or
    die, we spend the next few days on Erud&#146;s Crossing. Suddenly, treasure seems not so
    important anymore.&nbsp;</font></td>
