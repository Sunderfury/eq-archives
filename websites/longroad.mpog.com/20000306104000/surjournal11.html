  <p>The council was called into session and my fate decided. Not by people whom
  knew me as I am now, but rather men and women who knew me as a child and an
  apprentice. How had it gotten this far?</p>
  <p>When the note came, my heart stopped beating. Hager Sureshot’s seal was
  clearly visible and I already knew its contents. The last such correspondence
  was a letter of praise for a job well done, and a request that I receive
  training in mystical arts. However, I knew this letter would hold no such
  praise. Upon opening the letter my darkest fears were proven true.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <i><p>Surfal Dayspring,</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your presence is requested at the next meeting of
          the High Council. Your actions against the natural inhabitants of
          Surefall Glade and the surrounding Qeynos Hills have not gone
          unnoticed by your brothers and sisters. You are to make haste to
          Surefall Glade immediately. This is guild business and is not to be
          discussed with your ka-tet, most especially the druid Root. If you
          fail to meet the council at the required time you will be assumed
          guilty and an enemy of the guild, your life will be forfeit.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hager Sureshot, Guild Master</p></i>
        </blockquote>

  <p>I wondered how my actions could have made it to their ears, and then I saw
  him, Cros Treewind. As our eyes met he mouthed the words that chilled my
  blood, &quot;A good poacher&quot;. How could I have not known that he had been
  following us, tracking us? Hager’s next words were what I had been waiting
  on, &quot;Next order of business, the betrayal of Surfal Dayspring&quot;.</p>
  <p>As he recounted the scene I could only stare in wonderment at the detail. A
  young traveler, I believed him to be an enchanter, was walking to close to a
  rabid grizzly when it started to maul him. I could not let an innocent life
  fall prey to a diseased and crazed bear so I defended the young man and in
  doing so, slew the bear. After the story was told I was asked how I pled,
  &quot;Guilty&quot;.</p>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/j4-2.gif"></p>
  <p>I felt sure that Holly Windstalker would strike me down there with her
  fabled bow. That was of course assuming that Cros Treewind didn’t cut me
  down where I stood. &quot;Order&quot;, Hager demanded. &quot;Surfal, do you
  know the penalty for your actions?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I do&quot;, I tried to say with courage though fear ran rampant
  through my body. &quot;Hager, an innocent man was to die if I had not
  intervened. He has as much right to life as any animal in the Glade. I could
  not in right mind allow his destruction&quot;.</p>
  <p>&quot;Traitor&quot;, Cros screamed, and drew his blade.</p>
  <p>&quot;Order&quot;, Hager once more demanded. &quot;Surfal, you have
  violated our oldest and most sacred law. The penalty is death, as is our
  custom. However, I am not without a soul, nor am I without pity for you. You
  were not born into our way of life although we took you in as one of our own.
  You just don’t belong with us young man. I hereby banish you from Surefall
  Glade. You have until night fills the sky to leave this place, after that I
  can not guarantee your safety&quot;. He paused, &quot;Go to the city in the
  trees and prove your worth, perhaps someday you can once more embrace the
  glade as your home&quot;.</p>
  <p>The counsel stood and turned their backs on me, as did the people in
  attendance. All, save one, Cros Treewind. He stared me in the eye and mouthed
  the same words once more, &quot;A good poacher&quot;.</p>
  <p>I left.</p>
