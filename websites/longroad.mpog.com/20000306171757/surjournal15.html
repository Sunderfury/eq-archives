    </font><font SIZE="2"><p>I have never seen the seas this calm. In fact, I have never seen
    any body of water this calm. Common sense would have told me that Brent should be the one
    to go. He is not weighted by armor and his body is supposed to be a finely kept tool. Why
    then had Jhared insisted that he be the one to venture out to the sunken ship? It had been
    over three minutes and still his head had not broken the surface of the water. If there
    were at least an air bubble to rise, then my spirit would have felt better. Against his
    direct wishes, I had decided to follow him out to the ship and investigate on my own. I
    would gladly accept any disciplinary action he dealt but for now, I knew he needed my
    help.</p>
    <p>I had no sooner gotten knee deep than Jhared jumped from the water no more than three
    paces to my right. As I started to offer my assistance he ran past me to where our party
    had been sitting. Immediately three more figures rose from the depths and followed him to
    the shore. The battle was engaged and I was out of position. Valarie, still shaken from
    the previous encounter cast a healing spell on Jhared as Brent began to pummel the closest
    zombie. Jhared was breathing too hard to cast any spells of his own and when he did try,
    the zombies would hit him and disrupt his concentration. Karana, why didn&#146;t stay in
    my assigned spot!</p>
    <p>I drew back my bowstring and let arrows fly while I worked my way towards the battle. I
    struck one of the zombies in the leg and lower back but all three continued to pummel
    Jhared. Valarie had changed from an offensive stance to a purely defensive one, bathing
    Jhared in healing magic. </p>
    <p>Once close enough I started taunting one of the undead off of Jhared and it responded
    by slicing open my gullet with a two handed scythe. Out of the corner of my eye I saw that
    Brent had hit the other zombie hard enough to get it&#146;s full attention away from
    Jhared and onto himself. Having dropped my bow into the water I drew my hand-to-hand
    weapon and started hacking at the creature. My blood loss was heavy and the axe felt like
    it weighed a ton. I continued my taunts but I felt the zombie needed little more
    encouragement to finish me off. His next blow ripped into my side and I fell to my knees.
    I could no longer see anything around me, and everything seemed to move in slow motion. I
    tried to remember my healing spells but everything seemed so cluttered. Why had we come
    here? I am sure I could remember if everyone would stop shouting. Looking down, the sand
    was soaked with blood. I tried to look up but was met with another slash from a weapon.
    Darkness&#133;&#133;&#133;</p>
    <p>The stars were never brighter. My head felt like it had the first time I met Fyodor. My
    stomach ached, but was whole again. I tried to get up but was forced back down by a large
    female hand. </p>
    <p>&quot;Where is Jhared?&quot; I asked</p>
    <p>&quot;I am here, Surfal, and I am well&quot; he returned.</p>
    <p>I am not sure how long the night lasted but I am sure that Jhared didn&#146;t waste a
    single minute of it. By morning I made myself a promise to never stray from a group plan.
    My actions, though filled with concern for a friend, nearly cost three lives on a foreign
    beach. I truly thought after Blackburrow and Runnyeye that I had learned all the lessons
    one could learn. However, it seems there many lessons to be learned, on The Long Road.</font></td>
