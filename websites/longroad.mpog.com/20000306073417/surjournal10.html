  <p>Four foot long, no, probably closer to four and a half. The indent has to
  be close to twelve inches. The worst ranger on his worst day would have no
  trouble tracking this beast. There were Hill Giants near by, very near by.
  This footprint was all the proof anyone needed.</p>
  <p>I had thought I had heard a low rumble in the night but with the ringing in
  my ears my senses could not be trusted. At the very worst I feared it might be
  approaching rains but never a Hill Giant. Thank Karana that the tracks were
  leading to the north and our journey was taking us to the west, towards the
  Qeynos Hills. </p>

  <p>Part of me was curious to see how Fyodor would react to seeing a Hill
  Giant; a bigger part of me hoped I never found out. Jhared had asked if it was
  a male or female and told him male. It was purely a guess but I had my pride
  at stake. I fully believe that once my tracking improves that I will be able
  to answer such questions truthfully but for now, a slight deception wouldn’t
  hurt. Besides, after the imbroglio with the Wisp my ego couldn’t stand much
  more whipping.</p>
  <p>It was decided that we distance as much land between it and us as possible.
  This would keep us closer to the water and add perhaps an extra day to the
  journey but better to not tempt fate and live then be foolish and bury your
  friends.</p>
