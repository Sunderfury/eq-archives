<font size="-2">Day </font></b></font><b><font size="-2">Forty-Two - Eastern
  Plains of Karana</font></b><p><font size="2">The journey through the savage
  Gorge of King Xorrb was not as frightful this time as we headed for Qeynos
  from Rivervale. We deftly avoided the brutal Minotaurs and even managed to
  claim a Muddite trophy before we reached the Eastern Plains of Karana. </font><p><font size="2">We
  pressed on, despite our fatigue, to try and make the wooden bridge before
  camping. It was probably a mistake but worked out in the end, as we luckily
  avoided any Griffons in our path. The war in the Thicket has changed us all.
  We are more solemn but also more focused. In the heat of that siege we learned
  each other's movements and habits to the extent that very little communication
  is even required in combat any more. It is at once a fabulous asset and a
  haunting reminder. The conversation that night in the camp was brief and
  shallow as we still tried to avoid the murky waters of our emotions.</font><p><font size="2">It
  was Fyodor who broke the silence, just as we were all giving way to sleep.</font><p><font size="2">&quot;I
  know you are all pretty shaken up by what happened back there,&quot; Fyodor
  managed.&nbsp; &quot;No matter whether its Humans, Elves, Halflings or
  Gobs...that much blood and that many bodies can get under your skin. This
  wasn't my first war, of course. I was a volunteer in High Hold Pass my first
  year away from home. They were paying crazy money to stand around with a sword
  and I was so cocky back then.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">&quot;My father
  forbade me to go, saying that High Hold was a death trap, but I wanted money
  and I craved a chance to prove myself in battle. I certainly got that.&quot;
  Fyodor eyes lowered and his arched his back before stretching out on his
  bedroll. &quot;In six months, we went through 137 volunteers. All men my age
  or younger, all chasing a fat coin purse and a chance for childish glory. I
  was lucky enough to survive the experience and when my contract was up and
  packed my things and headed to Qeynos.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">By now,
  we were a captive audience. Fyodor hadn't spoken this much since I met him and
  his story explained so much about his character. &quot;I guess what I am
  trying to say is...you'll get over this feeling. It will never truly leave you
  but you'll learn to live with it. You won't be paralyzed by it like you are
  now. The best thing for you is a stiff drink and the companionship of someone
  who cares for you.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">At that Root perked up,
  &quot;The funny thing is...I was surrounded by my childhood friends and
  family. I was honored by my childhood heroes and what I really missed was
  this. A cold night and a warm fire and you three stretched freaks to insult.
  As much as I am glad to have visited, Rivervale is no longer my home.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Surfal
  started to roll away from us but then rolled back and sat up. &quot;I have a
  confession to make. I am afraid I may not have a home to go back to. There is
  a pending judgment on my banishment from the Protectors and I solemnly await
  the verdict. This has been weighing on me far more heavily than the battle and
  yet now I realize that whatever the outcome, I will always have a home. This
  campfire is warmer than the hearth back in the Glade and after all I have seen
  I don't know if the Glade is big enough to hold me now.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Fyodor
  smiled and said, &quot;no Glade is big enough for you, Tracker. You belong in
  the wide open. It is your element. I have known many Rangers but I have never
  seen one with your natural talent. You were made for days like these and they
  suit you far better than defending some helpless mammals in a copse of
  trees.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">Surfal laughed a bit and we all joined
  him.</font><p><font size="2">&quot;You know Surfal,&quot; I said as I sat up
  from my bedroll. &quot;I think we are home indeed. This long road we have
  traveled is just a small corner of Norrath and it stretches from sea to sea.
  With Karana to guide us and the strength of our will, I think we shall see it
  all before we rest in the ground. My father wanted me to be a scholar, my
  mother hoped I would someday be involved in politics in&nbsp; Qeynos. But I
  have found my place and I couldn't be happier with it.&quot;</font><p><font size="2">I
  reached into my bag and pulled out a skin of wine one of the Halflings had
  given me and I passed it around.</font><p><font size="2">Fyodor raised the
  skin before us and shouted at the top of his lungs for all of Norrath,
  &quot;TO THE LONG ROAD!!&quot;</font><p><font size="2">We all did the same and
  with the skin emptied we slept peacefully into the late morning.</font><p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
