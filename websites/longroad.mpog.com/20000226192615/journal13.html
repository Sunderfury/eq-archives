      <p><font size="2">I was never more pleased to see the docks of Qeynos.
      When the ship landed in the harbor, I almost bent down to kiss the rotten
      planks beneath my feet. Surfal, Brent and Valarie all went their own ways
      and I pledged to deliver the Blurred Map to the mysterious Erudite woman.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I found her near the Mermaid's Lute just a few yards
      from the ship. I consoled her as she wept for her lost apprentice and gave
      her the map. She thanked me and said she would mention my deeds to her
      people. Then she walked to the docks and awaited the next ship.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I felt terrible that there was no more I could do. I
      decided to visit the Temple of Thunder and check in with my brothers in
      faith.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">When I arrived, I was encouraged first to get a good
      night's sleep and a decent meal. I would have an audience with Renic
      Losaren, the guildmaster, in the morning. That filled me with excitement.
      Never before had I been summoned by Master Renic!&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day Eighty-One - South Qeynos</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Guildmaster Losaren had prepared a breakfast feast for
      he and myself to dine on while we talked. I was honored to be treated so
      well and I tried my best to contain my excitement.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/Renic.gif" width="420" height="315"></p>
      <p><font size="2">Master Renic asked for me to recount the details of my
      travels over the last months and he had many interesting comments about
      different parts of my adventures. As I finished the tale of our visit to
      Erud's Crossing, his eyes filled with pride. &quot;You have done well to
      defeat this Necromancer, Jhared. He was known to me. He has been&nbsp;
      eluding my best trackers for years. I had heard reports that perhaps you
      were the one who slew him on Erud's Crossing, which is why I called you
      here today.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I made sure to stress the importance of my friends'
      roles in his defeat and he acknowledged them saying, &quot;Your friends
      are turning into quite a formidable force, Jhared. You should cultivate
      your relationship with them. Friends you can trust are more valuable than
      platinum.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">We talked for some time, well past the lunch and dinner
      hours, and finally he took me by surprise. &quot;I have some news about
      your father, Jhared.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;A journal was delivered to me, which was found in
      his barracks here in Qeynos. It had been hidden under the boards near his
      bunk and was not discovered until a carpenter was hired to replace the old
      flooring of the Barracks. I have it here for you, but I wanted to speak to
      you before you read it.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Lumps formed in my throat. My father kept a secret
      journal? I never knew my father to write a word in his life. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Jhared, I am concerned that no matter what is
      contained in these pages, you will find yourself questioning your
      understanding of your father.</font><font size="2"> I know how you admired
      and respected your father and I want you to be prepared to judge what you
      read with a forgiving heart. Few sons are given the opportunity to see
      inside their father's heart and mind, and sometimes that vision can be
      hard to cope with. Just remember that despite your father's heroics and
      great deeds, he was merely human.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I nodded and reached out for the dusty book he held in
      his hand. It was tied with string and stuffed with notes and&nbsp; hand
      drawn maps. My heart was racing as I pulled at the string.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">A hand covered mine, stopping my progress. &quot;You
      should read this in private, Jhared. Don't you think?&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">I smiled at this man whom I suddenly felt so close to.
      &quot;Thank you, Master Renic. I will retire to my chambers.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">As I walked to my room, I tried to imagine what secrets
      I would find within the book's dusty pages.</font></p>
