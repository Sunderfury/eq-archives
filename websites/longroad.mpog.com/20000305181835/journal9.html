    Sworn</font> <font size="-1"></p>
    <p><b>Day </font><font size="-2">Seventy - Qeynos Hills</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2">We had been camped outside the Glade for three days. Before going in,
    Surfal had seemed quiet and anxious. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">After a short time, Root, Brent and Grannith decided to head back to
    Qeynos to replenish provisions and conduct some business. Fyodor and I stayed at the camp.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">When he emerged from the Glade, his guild tunic was no longer across his
    chest and head was hung low. When he raised his eyes to ours they were full of rage and
    sadness. &quot;This place is no longer my home,&quot; Surfal said through clenched teeth.
    &quot;I will never travel this way again and I ask that you respect my wishes by not
    expecting me to accompany you here in the future.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I had never seen Surfal like this. It was as if all the youthful
    exuberance we had come to expect from him was flushed from his body and an older, more
    chiseled spirit stood before us. Fyodor unsheathed his sword and brought it up to Surfal's
    chin, encouraging him to raise his head, which he did. &quot;That's better, lad.&quot;
    Fyodor smiled as he looked at Surfal. &quot;Your head need not lurk about your chest. You
    are far too good for the likes of these fools, anyway. We are your family now.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Surfal smiled a bit until a familiar voice shouted from the Glade
    entrance.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">&quot;Be seeing you around, Surfal.&quot; Cros Treewind stood in the
    entrance to the Glade and grinned the smile of a devil. &quot;I'm sure of it.&quot; I knew
    right then what had happened. Cros had called for Surfal's removal from the Protectors for
    that stupid rabid bear. At that point something in my mind just snapped.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I walked slowly in Cros' direction. I seemed to hear Fyodor shouting for
    me to stop. Then I heard Surfal telling Fyodor to leave me be.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Everything seemed in slow motion. I called out to Karana for the Hammer
    of Wrath and as it appeared before me, Cros twirled his staff. I swung the hammer at his
    ribs but he parried with the staff and sent me flying with a quick crushing blow to my
    chest. I leapt to my feet and spun in low, striking him across the legs. Another swipe of
    the staff sent me to the ground, before he even tried to stand. When I rose from the
    ground, I heard the sounds of insects.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">I turned to see the sky filling with wasps, bees and other stinging
    bugs. They moved with Cros' will and began piercing and tearing at my skin. They quickly
    dissipated and though bloodied and wounded, I rose again to my feet. I swung weakly with
    the hammer and&nbsp; Cros deflected the blow, finishing with a sharp jab to my skull. I
    tumbled to the grass and as I looked up as his grinning face, he prepared for the kill. He
    brought the staff down fast at my head and the sky around me filled with a yellow light.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The staff stopped an inch from my face and Cros struggled as he tried to
    push it closer. My body glowed with an eerie light and I knew right away what had
    happened. Karana had moved to protect me! The Rainkeeper himself was watching over me. I
    stood again and faced Cros, my hammer feeling like a boulder in my bloody arms. Cros tried
    everything, he swung with the staff and evoked powerful magics but nothing penetrated the
    yellow aura.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The clouds in the sky above began to swell and gather. The sun faded as
    a gray pall filled the air. Lightning and thunder ripped across the sky and the rain began
    to fall. I imagined Tunare and Karana at war in the heavens, each fighting to protect
    their warrior. Cros looked into the heavens and back into my face. For a moment I think I
    actually saw fear in his eyes and he turned and walked away, back into the safety of the
    Glade.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">He had been the better warrior, but there was no match for the power of
    Karana's storms. Someday I knew I would rival Cros' strength and I swore right there that
    when that day came, I would finish what I had started today.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Fyodor and Surfal ran to my side and helped me walk to the nearby camp.
    &quot;You truly are one crazy son of a Gnoll, Jhared!&quot; Fyodor laughed. &quot;But it
    looks as though you were not meant to fall today.&quot; As I began to lose consciousness,
    I saw Surfal and Fyodor look up into storming skies and pass a kind of fearful look
    between each other. I smiled as the rain washed away the blood from my wounds. Karana had
    touched me today and I knew nothing would ever be the same.</font> </td>
