How odd it feels to write about my life after years of transcribing and translating the written histories of others. This entire journal seems strange to me, but Sir Wolten was adamant. He says it will help me to focus myself and better learn from my mistakes.<p>

At the moment I am sitting under a cypress tree in front of the Qeynos city gates. Aside from childhood visits to the Qeynos Hills with father's patrol, I have rarely left the city itself.  It has been at least 6 years since I last walked the road to the Hills and I feel an odd sense of nostalgia and dread at the thought of it now. One day my father walked down this road and never returned. <p>

It is not death I am afraid of, exactly. I think perhaps I am more afraid of facing the forces that ultimately proved too strong for a man who I considered the strongest in the world.<p>

I will be careful and I know Karana will watch over me.<p>

I have found that the wild creatures of the Hills fear the mighty storms from which I draw my strength. I will use that to my advantage. If I travel under the cover of the storm, I will likely have more success in reaching my intended destination.<p>

Sir Wolten wants these papers delivered to the watch tower by this evening. 

I was told to meet my escort at the road marker in Qeynos Hills. Thanks to my family, I know most of the area guards but this Guard Cheslin must be new because his name is unfamiliar.

<p>
Cheslin is a foolish man, more wet behind the ears than I could have ever imagined a member of Bayle's watch to be. However, I suppose there must have been a time when even my father was so exuberant in his duties.<p>

I fear for Cheslin though. His naivete is likely to get him killed in these hills. The Sabretooth Clan will chew him up and spit him out if he is not more careful.<p>

We spotted a Blackburrow Scout as we crossed the hills and Cheslin almost broke into a run to engage it. I reminded him that his duty was to see me safely to the tower and he found his focus. The trip was rather uneventful and I find the tower is unchanged after six years. It is still the same cold and moldy pile of rocks I found so mystical as a child. I will enjoy sleeping here tonight. <p>

If Devlin does not have the materials Sir Wolten requires on hand, I may be here several nights which would please me beyond measure. It is nice to get out of the temple for a change.<p>
<p>

<p>
I have been put to good use here during my stay. There is a constant stream of wounded flooding into the tower in the evenings, most are weary travelers who were besieged by members of ther Sabretooth Clan or the wandering soulless dead that plague this area. Damn that Varsoon! Am I to never see a day when his nefarious handiwork has not brought pain and suffering to another innocent soul? <p>

I have been healing the wounded and trying to bolster their courage with the words of The Rainkeeper. 

Once word got out that a Knight of Thunder was on hand at the tower, the tower became a bustling center of activity. That did not please Mogan Devlin but I think it is a nice change for the guardsmen, who welcome the idea of someone else being plagued with requests for assistance for a change.<p>

As a child I never truly realized how violent and dangerous these hills are. That sense of childhood invulnerability glossed over the brutal truth that the Hills are more in the hands of Varsoon and the Sabretooth Clan than the guards of Qeynos. This outpost is merely a waystation and a tenuous one at that.<p>

I have been asked by some travellers to help them investigate reports of unusual undead activity in the West Valley. I think I will join them tonight, as Devlin does not expect to have the materials Sir Wolten needed for another day or two.<p>
