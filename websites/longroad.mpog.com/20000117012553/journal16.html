      <p><font size="2">Fyodor had arrived early this morning with a young Woof
      Elf named Samwize. Samwize explained that if we would pay him a platinum a
      piece, he would run with us all the way into Highhold Pass. </font>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/thebard.gif">
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We all coughed up the coin and set out across the
      plains. Traveling with Samwize was everything I had ever heard. We
      traveled with the speed of birds, and if you looked away from the ground
      below you, your eyes would fool you into thinking you were flying. It was
      wonderful. Had I not been so worried about Surfal, I would have wanted it
      to continue for days.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">When we reached the second Guard Tower, I begged that we
      stop while I rested. Samwize laughed. &quot;Silly Human. You needed only
      tell me you were winded. Allow me to demonstrate...&quot; As Samwize
      changed the song he was singing to a lively jig, I felt my weary legs
      rejuvenate with life. I was no longer tired and in fact I felt unusually
      vigorous. We set out again with no need for rest. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I was starting to like this Bard, despite his sarcastic
      tone.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As we rounded a large hill in the middle of the plains,
      Samwize stopped dead in his tracks. &quot;Everyone stay low, Giant
      ahead.&quot; </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I peeked over the crest of the hill to get a look below.
      Hill Giants were a frightening sight, but one I couldn't resist. As the
      Giant grew closer, Fyodor suddenly jumped to his feet. &quot;My God! There
      is a child down there.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We all stood and saw the poor child. She was running
      across the plains and the Giant was only minutes from her. As I looked in
      the direction the Giant had come from, I could see smoke rising from a
      small cottage.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">When I looked back, Samwize was gone. &quot;Distract the
      Gianr, I will get the girl.&quot; </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I was in amazement as Samwize sped right in the path of
      the mighty Giant. I turned to Hybrow. &quot;Light him up, my Elven friend.
      Let's see those fireworks of yours.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Hybrow's eyes gleamed with delight. &quot;Very well
      then, hold on your trousers gentleman.&quot; Suddenly a giant ball of fire
      flew from his hands and soared towards the Giant. It struck true and
      gained us the pleasure of the Giant's attention.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">The Giant bolted in our direction. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Stand your ground, boys. We will likely fall to
      this one, but we must give Sammy the time to get that child clear.&quot;
      Fyodor tightened the grip on his axe. I pulled my hammer from its sling
      and offered a prayer to Karana. Hybrow simply danced a little jig. I was
      starting to see why Fyodor liked this snooty Elf. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">The Giant towered above us. Our initial strategy was
      simply not to get driven into the Earth. We managed to dodge the first of
      the Giant's powerful blows but the second caught me in shoulder. I flew a
      good ten feet through the air and landed hard. My shoulder was crushed for
      sure and I could feel the shattered ribs in my chest as they scraped at my
      lungs.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Fyodor's best hits were like mosquito bites to the
      mighty Giant and it made it way to finish me off. As it raised its hands
      for the kill, I suddenly felt my body lifted from the ground. As I did my
      best to keep conscious, I realized what had happened. Samwize had returned
      for us. Fyodor had slung me over his shoulder and we were running for our
      lives. The Giant gave chase but could not catch us. As we crossed the
      plains into the Northern fields, the Giant turned and gave up. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Sorry for the delay, boys. I had to get that child
      to a safe spot before I could get back. These blasted plains offer little
      cover. I will be back momentarily.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Samwize sped off in the direction of the Giant,
      presumably to recover the child. I tried my best not to pass out. Hybrow
      and Fyodor bound my wounds, but I knew my chances were slim off making
      through the night. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Jhared, do you have the strength to heal
      yourself?&quot; Hybrow whispered. I knew I did not and the world turned
      black.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day Eighty-Six - Northern Plains of Karana</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As my vision took shape, I saw four bodies around the
      campfire. Fyodor, Samwize, Hybrow and the young girl. I tried to move but
      my chest burned with pain, so I lay back on the ground. Fyodor came to my
      side and smiled.&nbsp; &quot;I am quite glad you survived, Cleric. I would
      have missed your whining.&quot; I tried to smile but managed more of a
      smirk.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I was introduced to the child next. Her name was Chaeli
      and Samwize made sure I knew not to mention her family before we spoke.
      They had food for the Giant and her home was destroyed. Chaeli was bright
      for her age, which we guessed was about 13. She was quiet but I attributed
      that more to shock than her nature. She prepared a bowl of soup for me and
      fed me while I regained my strength. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Samwize played a song on his lute while we camped there
      which seemed to somehow aid my body's ability to heal itself. Unlike my
      healing magicks, this song worked slowly, aiding the body with a constant
      encouragement to mend. Once I was strong enough to work my magic, I healed
      myself. My chest and shoulder would be sore and weak for days but I felt
      much better.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As we set out for Highhold Pass, I asked Fyodor what we
      planned to do with Chaeli. He explained that she had no family and that we
      would have to take her along, at least until we could find a safe house
      for her to stay at while we journeyed to the Keep. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We found an Inn in the Eastern Plains, where Hybrow knew
      the Innkeeper. He promised to watch over her until we returned. Though I
      had only been in her company for a matter of hours, I felt responsible for
      Chaeli. I made a vow to Karana to find her a good home. At her age, she
      would be welcomed by the Temple at the very least.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We said our farewells and moved on across the plains
      towards the mountains, we were close but not there yet.</font>
