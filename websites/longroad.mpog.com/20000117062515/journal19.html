      Finally Makes His Move</font></p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day One Hundred and Three - Highhold Keep</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I was awakened in the night by the sound of someone
      entering my room. My mind raced as I grabbed my hammer. Perhaps now that
      the siege was over, Carson had sent someone to punish me for my father's
      betrayal. I prepared to strike as they entered the room and my heart ran
      like a rabbit.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As the door swung open I held my hammer high, waiting to
      strike. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Instead, the door only cracked and a long tube crept
      into my room at eye level. At first I thought it to be some kind of
      telescope but it seemed too small for that. I followed its aim and saw
      that it pointed to my bed. With my hurried exit, I had left the bed linens
      in such a way that they appeared to be occupied. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I decided to wait and see what this was about, but my
      mind already knew this was an assassin. Suddenly a small projectile flew
      from the end of the tube and into the bunched up linens that seemed to
      still cover me. Had I been lying there I am quite sure that I would be
      twisting in poisoned agony. When the tube began to retract, I swung the
      door open fast. Before I even made eye contact with the figure in the
      doorway my hammer had struck its mark sending the assassin into the stone
      wall across the way. I summoned my magics and soothed the figure to a
      state of almost sleeplike relaxation. Then I moved in close.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I was astonished to find that this assassin was in fact,
      a woman. I tried to cloud that fact in my mind and I hit her swiftly in
      the back of the skull with the handle of my hammer. Unconscious, I dragged
      her to Surfal's room. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Under the lamp light, Surfal and I looked her over while
      Surfal did his best to clear his head. He had probably only slept a few
      hours in the last two weeks and he looked it. &quot;She is Teir Dal,
      Jhared.&quot; I pulled away the mask she wore and although I was not
      familiar with the phrase, I knew immediately what it meant when I saw her
      skin. Dark Elves! This only further proved that Carson was involved in
      something far worse than gambling. The Dark Elves were known for their
      wretched, murderous ways. No man who could call on the Dark Elves for his
      dirty work coudl possibly be anything less than a murdering thief himself.
      He presence alone would prove my father's accusations in a Qeynos
      Tribunal.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Surfal found three more &quot;darts&quot; in a pouch on
      her hip and he quickly verified that they were poisoned. I pointed out
      that one of them had probably been meant for him. He cursed Jracol under
      his breath and we went about tying up our captive.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;What will we do with her, Jhared? She is dangerous
      and I do not trust these ropes to hold her for long once she awakens, even
      without her tools.&quot; Surfal slipped the bag of fine metal instruments
      into his backpack for safe keeping. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;I do not know, Surfal. To flush out Carson, maybe
      we should turn her over to Ashlan and hope he is not involved in her
      presence here.&quot; Surfal frowned. &quot;Well I am not used to assassins
      showing up in my bedroom, Surfal. What do you suggest?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Let's get the others.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Surfal stayed to watch her while I fetched our friends.
      As we entered Surfal's room, there was a collective gasp as everyone
      realized what she was. &quot;A Tier Dal assassin attacked you and you
      lived, Jhared. You should thank your god for that!&quot; Grannith grumbled
      as he looked her over.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Everyone began musing over our next step while Hybrow
      simply stared at her. I should have known something was wrong then, but I
      didn't act quickly enough. Fyodor must have sensed Hybrow's actions as I
      did because we both reached for his hands at the same time, which ended up
      to be too late to stop him.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">He drove the small dagger deep into her heart with
      precision and as her body twitched and flailed in response he whispered
      something in Elvish into her ears. Surfal, Arsindrick and Samwize all
      nodded their heads in support. I pulled Hybrow off of her and pushed him
      against the stone wall. &quot;What in the name of God are you doing, Hy?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">His eyes chilled and they seemed to stare into the back
      of my brain. &quot;Tier Dal assassins killed every member of my family's
      House. In eight of your human years I watched as my cousins, siblings and
      even my parents turned up murdered. To be Tier Dal, is to be evil. There
      are no exceptions. This one will hurt no more and I will not waste one
      more moment of my life explaining myself to you for this piece of filth.
      Take your hands off of me now, Human!&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Fyodor pulled me back and Hybrow left Surfal's room. I
      looked in astonishment as Sam, Arsin and Surfal spit on the corpse of the
      lifeless assassin. I know she had meant me dead, but I had never meant to
      kill her. Not a woman, not even a Dark Elf woman. My sheltered Human
      upbringing was being challenged and I simply didn't know what to say next.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;It is better this way, I think,&quot; Fyodor said
      as he released my arms. &quot;Prisoners are only enemies you will have to
      kill another day. You should thank Hybrow for his decision. It saved you
      the moral dilemma you are facing now. It was the right choice and I do not
      think you could have made it, Jhared.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I must have looked like a lost puppy to them. I stumbled
      to my room and fell on my bed. I looked at the dart, carefully avoiding
      its poison tip. They were right, but my mind just couldn't wrap around it
      all.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As I fell to sleep, I prayed I did not see her face in
      my dreams.</font>
