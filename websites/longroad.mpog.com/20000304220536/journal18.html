      <p><font size="2">I listened in to Fyodor and Surfal's conversation with a
      certain amount of distraction. Fyodor was trying to find out all he could
      about Surfal's encounter with the Lady Isabo. We were all astounded with
      the incredible gifts she had bestowed upon him. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I remembered my own encounter with the beautiful Isabo.
      Fresh out of the Temple she had appeared from nowhere and given me a mace.
      When I asked her about it, she had said, &quot;Though you do not know it
      yet, you and I will someday be strong allies. Use this and we will meet
      again.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I had recognized her name immediately when Surfal
      recounted his story of meeting her and I had decided to keep it to myself.
      Perhaps she was some Avatar of Karana, a blessed angel of mercy meant to
      watch over his followers. I wasn't sure but I knew that when I met her
      again I had even more to thank her for.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We stayed in the tavern waiting for Captain Ashlan. We
      had been told that he wanted to meet with us regarding our helping in the
      defense of the Keep. I was still a bit nervous about exposing myself to
      Carson's revenge but I knew that my friends were right. I needed to face
      this before I let it rule my life.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Ashlan arrived shortly after dusk. He bought us all a
      nice dinner and after a long discussion we agreed to take on the role of
      Keep defenders for a while. Ashlan had heard of Grannith and expressed his
      hope that we would be able to convince our Dwarven friend to come and join
      us. It seems that word of Grannith's exploits in the Battle of the Wall in
      Rivervale had preceded him.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">McCabe must have a fourtune at his disposal, because we
      were all to be paid a healthy sum for every Gnoll and Orc scalp we
      delivered. We were even given a small stipend every week to maintain our
      living expenses while we stayed here. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I told myself that I would only stay on until I had
      something to connect Carson to the illegal actions he was involved in. I
      know that Guildmaster Lorsaren had not wanted me to come here, but now
      that I was I thought it best to do a little investigating. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We all went to bed after the meeting and agreed to meet
      up at the South Gate in the morning to watch for Mucktail Gnolls.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day Ninety-Three - Highhold Pass</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">The past two days have passed like hours. Within minutes
      of arriving at the South Gate, we were immediately under siege. There were
      two other group of mercenaries at the gate and we all tried our best to
      watch each other's backs. The Gnolls attacked from the south with no
      consideration for their own safety. Gnoll Soothsayers and Shaman keep the
      Gnolls well healed and rooted the more dangerous of our forces, leaving
      them at the mercy of the Gnoll attackers. Each wave was led by Gnoll
      Champions, large brutish Gnolls who proved far superior in combat to most
      of our allies. Only our quick thinking brought us through alive.</font>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/surfpass.gif" width="420" height="315">
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">The Gnolls retreated when a large group of
      reinforcements arrived from the Keep, but we spent the next 36 hours
      resting and fighting. Occasionally the Gnolls brought with them their
      tainted wizards, the dreaded Flamepaws and those fights were usually the
      worst. I watched many a Volunteer die a horrible burning death at their
      hands. Once I caught sight of a particularly well armored Gnoll in the
      pass, but he never ventured close enough to get a good sight of. Some of
      the others said they had seen him as well. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Ashlan called him Grenix and said they believed he was a
      leader of some kind amongst the Mucktails. Very little was known about
      him. Ashlan also said he believed the Mucktails had a base camp in the
      Eastern Plains of Karan but he had never successfully found it. Surfal's
      eye lit when he heard that and I knew it wouldn't be long before my
      curious friend went tracking their lair.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We only have about 6 more hours until we are needed back
      at our posts, so I will end this journal here. I can only hope that my
      letters find Grannith, Valarie, Brent and Root soon. We need all the
      assistance we can get and I fear the Mucktails will overcome us by the
      week's end.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day Ninety-Eight - Highhold Pass</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">What a strange hell is battle. Twice I have fought in
      large scale skirmishes and both times I have found them to be frightening
      and wonderful. Though the carnage sickened me at first, I now find myself
      reveling in the frenzy of each day. I have been learning tactics and
      strategy from a Dwarven Cleric from Kaladim. He has taught me many things
      and I have found that I am a very effective leader in small group battles.
      It is a role I enjoy and as the days pass I find myself getting lost in it
      all. I have made many new friends and I am glad to be surrounded by my
      oldest friends as well. Grannith, Valarie and Brent arrived a few days ago
      and have proven to be wonderful additions to the squad. An elven enchanter
      named Arsindrick has also proven to be a wonderful ally and I find his
      company to be particularly comforting, perhaps it is his relaxed nature. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I know my goals were to look into Carson's business but
      how can I leave my friends and allies at the mercy of the Mucktails for
      such personal reasons. They need me and I know I must serve them first. I
      received a letter from Guildmaster Lorsaren and he is not pleased. He
      feels I am losing sight of my more important goals. He wants me to move on
      to Freeport to deliver the message from Sir Wolten. I informed him I would
      do as he asked as soon as the situation improved here in the pass and no
      sooner.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Karana would never forgive me for abandoning these
      people. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I have killed more Gnolls than I can count and though I
      take little pleasure in it, I rest well at night knowing that the next day
      may finally be the end of the onslaught. Ashlan fears that the Shralok
      Orcs to the North will wait until we are at our weakest and then attack
      the North Gate. I cannot imagine an Orc being so intelligent but he
      assures me that the Shraloks are not to be underestimated. I have gained
      Ashlan's trust and soon I hope I shall have his respect as well. He is
      much like my father, only more ravaged by battle. </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Perhaps tomorrow will be the end.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day One Hundred and Two - Highhold Keep</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">We waited at our posts for 36 hours to be sure, but it
      seems the siege is finally over. The Mucktails no longer swarm the South
      Gate and it appears we have won a lasting victory. Ashlan is organizing
      search and destroy parties to run down the remaining Mucktails in the
      Eastern Plains but I doubt I will sign up for that duty. The time has come
      for me to address my responsibilities to the Temple. I will try and leave
      in the morning. I hope my friends decide to join me.</font>
