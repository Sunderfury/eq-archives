My official training is now complete and I am to approach Hager Sureshot for my Ranger tunic.  If he deems me worthy, then I will be given a tan tunic and I can take my place beside my fellow Ranger brethren. If he deems my actions unworthy of the Ranger Guild then I will be banned from Surefall Glade and will most likely be banned from all of Qeynos.  <p>
I have to study as to the best of my abilities but some of the skills that come easy to others I toil with.  I have learned to communicate with the bears in the Glade and my tracking skills are on par with Cros Treewind's if I do say so myself but my swimming skills are sub par at best and archery has not been easy for me.  I can only hope that Karana shines favorably on me this day.  <p>
If only things came as easy to me as they do to Binwin.<p>

My meeting with Hager Sureshot could not have gone better.  Not only did I receive a tunic but I have also been given an assignment.  <p>
I am to travel to Qeynos and find a Druid that travels by the name Root.  That, in and of itself is not odd, but the Druid is a Halfling.  When I asked Hager why I was to do this I learned a new lesson as a full fledged Ranger, never question a guild master.  Once I picked myself up from the forest floor I immediately made my way to Qeynos.  I had made the journey a few times but never without escort.  <p>
I stopped by the local provisioner and petitioned for a short sword, a few muffins, and a couple of flasks of water.  I was told that he would fill my flasks this time but if I was to ever prove myself I would have to forage for myself.  <p>
As I approached the city area of Qeynos, I was laid upon by a decaying skeleton.  I can say with all confidence that it was decaying because the smell was awful.  I quickly drew steel and slashed at the skeleton only to have it deflect my every shot.  For a creature composed of pure bone and arcane magic it strikes hard, and it strikes true.  I was soon on my back and barely alive when the undead creature drew close to finish me off.  As I shielded my eyes from his final blow I heard a loud explosion and felt bones fall over me.  As I opened my eyes I saw a man dressed in cleric garments standing over me with his hand extended.  After helping me up and casting a minor healing spell on me he introduced himself to me.<p>
Thank Karana for Jhared Irsei.
