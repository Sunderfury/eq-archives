I was born into a life of moderate means in the city of Qeynos. My father was a town guard and my mother worked as a cook in the home of a prominent city politician. <p>

When I was ten, my tutors encouraged my parents to place me in the scholastic care of the Temple of Life. My aptitude for reading and writing were good and I showed promise as a scholar, they said. My father, a battle hardened but overprotective man, loved the idea. He hoped it would keep me from following in his footsteps and joining up with the guard. <p>

During my fourth year of study at the Temple of Rodcet Nife, my father was brutally murdered at the ruins of the Qeynos Hills. At the time, I was told that he was butchered by gnolls. In hindsight I realize that the deception was meant to spare a young boy the horrors of the truth, but a year after his death I discovered a record of the incident and for a boy of fifteen vengeance is an easy path.<p>

In all of the Qeynos Hills, there is only one name that strikes fear into the hearts of good and evil alike, Varsoon. Varsoon is a twisted demon of a man whose necromantic powers make him one of the most deadly creatures in all of Antonica. The ruins near the entrance to Surefall Glade are sometimes frequented by Varsoon, something which the the guards of Antonius Bayle overlook out of fear. My father was different. On a hazy evening, two hapless travellers crossed the fallen stone pillars of the ruins. Immediately beset by dread corpses and putrid skeletons they cried out for the assistance of the guard. My father was patrolling nearby and ran to their aid. After dispatching the undead, the travellers began to thank him when their words were suddenly cut short. Their faces went slack with fear, as they motioned to something behind my father. He turned to face Varsoon and his vile pet. Before my father could draw his blade, Varsoon charmed him. He forced my father to murder those two innocent travelers before making him turn the blade on himself.

It is believed in my parent's faith that these acts, though not voluntary, will banish my father's soul from reaching the blessed aerie of the afterlife. I refused to accept that.<p>

I fought with the priests in the temple for days and nights. They tried to explain that acceptance was the only path to spiritual peace, but I condemned them for their mindless and rigid beliefs.<p> 

At that time, much as it is today, the Temple of Life is in constant dispute with Qeynos' other major temple, the Temple of Thunder. Rodcet Nife and Karana do not see eye to eye. Perhaps that was the original motivation for my seeking out the Priests of Karana, perhaps it was a true calling - I cannot say. I walked into the Temple of Thunder full of rage and distrust and Karana welcomed me with an open heart. The Knights of Thunder, sworn enemies of Varsoon and the practice of Necromancy, showed me the truth of things. They showed me the path of peace through retribution. A way to avenge my father's death and bring peace and order to the world.

They also recognized that my natural instincts for combat were very strong, something I am quite sure I received from my father. They taught me that my scholastic aptitude was very important but that my fighting prowess needed to be honed as well. <p>

I quickly realized that any plans of challenging Varsoon would require a great amount of patience, as it would take decades to achieve a level of skill and power equal to his. So I learned patience, and I learned the value of cold rage -- a storm that never stops and never loses strength. <p>

Some day Varsoon will turn to face me as my father once faced him and he shall know the power of the storm. Karana has shown me the way.<p>
