    Qeynos</strong>
    </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">When I awoke I gathered with my temple brothers and
      sisters for breakfast. After we all finished eating, there was usually a
      lot of conversation about the table. Sister Leora recounted her recent
      trip to the hellish Lavastorm Mountains, a place she described as the most
      foul corner of Norrath. We all listened intently to her descriptions of
      wild beasts made of fire and fire breathing dragons no larger than a
      horse. While most seemed frightened, I have to admit I was somewhat
      excited by the tale. That place sounded like something Surfal would enjoy
      as well. I made a note to myself to tell him of it when next we met.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As we broke from the table, I went to the courtyard to
      enjoy the morning sun. Sir Wolten, who had been my mentor, approached me
      and we spoke at length about my recent travels. He had been reading my
      letters and he had many questions about the vile necromancer we
      encountered on Erud's Crossing. Suddenly, the conversation changed course
      and I realized he had been waiting to bring something up.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Jhared. Do you remember the letter you brought me
      from Drosco?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I shuddered slightly and gathered myself. &quot;Of
      course, master. I remember it quite well. In fact, I seem to remember you
      had wanted to ask me something when I returned from Erud's Crossing.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Wolten smiled. &quot;Yes, I admit I have been hesitant
      to bring it up. I know that Drosco's death disturbed you.&quot; Wolten
      looked up into the sky and continued, &quot;Jhared, I need your help. But
      this time, you will not find the mission to be so pleasant.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Master, I do not fear the course Karana choses for
      me. If there is something you require of me, just ask. I will not
      disappoint you.&quot;&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Wolten frowned, which caused a certain amount of anxiety
      for me. &quot;It isn't that you would disappoint me, Jhared. The mission I
      am sending you on requires you to travel a great distance. Once you reach
      your destination, your life would be in great danger. I am concerned.
      These same forces you would be at risk from are the same ones who killed
      Drosco.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">It was only a small gulp, but Wolten noticed it and
      grinned ever so slighty. &quot;Master, I would be honored to continue
      Drosco's work. As you know, I always admired him when I was studying here.
      It would be my pleasure. I have many friends who would watch my back, as
      well. I will be fine.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Your friends are exactly why I chose you for this,
      Jhared. You have a strong group of allies in them. Their assistance may
      save your hide if things go bad in Freeport.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Freeport? I never imagined he meant Freeport. All my
      life I had heard stories of that cursed town and its dirty streets.
      Compared to Qeynos, Freeport was pure chaos. Travelers often tell of the
      rampant corruption in the City Guard there and I have even heard that
      necromancers walk the streets in some parts of the city. However, if
      Wolten needs me to go there I suppose I shall have to go.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;What is it you need, exactly?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;You must deliver this message to the Guildmaster
      in the Hall of Truth. She will be expecting you, but beware...she tells me
      that the Knights of Truth are at war with several other factions within
      the city. The Bloodsabres will not be your only foe in the streets of
      Freeport. Keep an open eye.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I took the note and I headed back to say farewell to my
      comrades. I also wanted to thank Renic for his support. While I was
      packing my backpacks for the trip, Renic swung the dorr to my room wide
      open and his face was ashen white. &quot;Isn't your traveling companion
      named Surfal Dayspring?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Aye, Master Renic. Surfal is one of best friends.
      I was just about to go looking for him in the Qeynos Hills.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Renic led me to the courtyard where a bloody corpse lay
      across the grass. It was a Dark Elf, dressed in fine silks and jewelry.
      From the look of him, he had been dead for at least a day.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Most of the temple knights were assembled around the
      body, and Wolten nodded my way in a sign of support. Renic started to
      speak but I knew what he was going to say before it left his lips,
      &quot;This is Jracol Brestiage, the man your father suspected as a spy for
      Carson McCabe. It appears that your friend Surfal got into a fight with
      him outside the city.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Wolten Put his hands on my shoulders, &quot;Looks like
      made a good accounting for himself, too.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Renic frowned at Wolten. &quot;Jhared, you realize that
      this puts your friend Surfal in great danger. Jracol was no mere errand
      boy. He was a highly valued agent for McCabe. He will send out
      trackers.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I knew that the minute he confirmed that Surfal had been
      the one that killed Jracol.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Jhared, there is something else.&quot; Renic put
      his hand out, revealing a bloody note. &quot;He had this on him.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><i><font size="2">Carson,</font></i>
      </p>
          <p><i><font size="2">Your suspicions were correct. The Irsei child is
          the same one our people spotted in Rivervale. But he is no servant to
          Bayle. He walks under Karana's wing in the tutelage of Renic Losaren.
          He will hard to kill until he leaves the city. But I think I found a
          way to make sure he comes to you.&nbsp;</font></i>
      </p>
          <p><i><font size="2">A message I left in the Qeynos taverns begs for
          the aid of noble adventurers. It asks for them to come to Highpass to
          save the Keep from the Mucktails and Shraloks. Surely many will answer
          the note, and I imagine Ashlan will be gald to have them in the pass,
          but most importantly we will bring the young Knight of Thunder out of
          his shell.</font></i>
      </p>
          <p><i><font size="2">Make sure you make a warm reception for him. My
          sources say he has no idea his father ever served you. All he needs
          now is a little bow around his head to make this anymore perfect.
          Happy Birthday, Carson and enjoy your present.</font></i>
      </p>
          <p><i><font size="2">Jracol</font></i>
      </p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="2">I tried to stand straight but I couldn't. Only yesterday
      I learned of my father's past and already it was on my doorstep, with an
      assassin's blade in hand.&nbsp;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Renic leaned over to me. &quot;Jhared, the letter never
      reached Carson. He doesn't know about Jracol's death just yet, though I
      cannot imagine it will take long for word to reach him. You must find your
      friend and make sure he stays clear of Highhold Keep for some time. I will
      try and think of a good way to resolve this while you and Surfal lay
      low.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I thanked everyone and started back for my room. I
      finished packing my backpacks and I headed out for Surefall Glade. Surfal
      was not the kind of man who liked to lay low. It would take take some
      convincing. As I headed out of the city gates, a familiar voice called my
      name.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I turned to see Fyodor and a High Elf walking my way.
      &quot;Jhared, I tried to visit you this morning but that Temple of Thunder
      is locked up tighter than a drum. What's going on?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I looked at the High Elf and back to Fyodor and said,
      &quot;Nothing really. Just some important ceremonies, nothing of
      interest.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Fyodor broke out into laughter. &quot;Jhared, this is
      Hybrow. This young looking Elf is one of my oldest friends, though he is
      twice my age for sure. You can speak freely in front of him. I trust him
      with my life, so I doubt your secrets are at risk.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Hybrow bowed and introduced himself. His words flowed
      like poetry as he spoke. High Elves were an unusual people and they made
      me a little nervous. They looked so perfect, as if their bodies and faces
      were made of porcelain. It was all I could do to keep from touching him to
      make sure he was real.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As Hybrow shook my hands, he turned his head to the
      right and sniffed my shirt cuffs. &quot;You smell of Dark Elf, little one.
      Has one of my cousins troubled you lately?&quot; Hybrow seemed insistent
      in his query and his face was very serious, despite his words.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Yes, it is why I must speak to Fyodor. If you
      would both like to accompany me to the Hills, we could talk along the
      way.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Hybrow grimaced openly, causing another round of
      laughter from Fyodor. &quot;My old friend just hates interacting with his
      lesser cousins. Therefore, I insist we join you.&quot; Hybrow gave Fyodor
      a wry smile and we set out across the Hills.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="1"><b>Day Eighty-Four - Qeynos Hills</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;So Jhared, are you planning on joining us on our
      expedition?&quot; Fyodor asked as we came within sight of Blackburrow's
      face in the mountainside.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;What trip is that, Fyodor?&quot; I asked.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Didn't you get Surfal's note? He sent word to
      Grannith, Brent and I that he was in need of our assistance. Something
      about a city under siege from Gnolls and Orcs. The place is up in the
      mountains near Rivervale. I think its called...&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Highhold Keep.&quot; </font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">&quot;Yes! That's the place. Surfal headed out two days
      back, he wanted to scout ahead and asked that we follow him along as soon
      as we could. That's why Hybrow and I came by the Temple this
      morning.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">At the pieces were still fitting together within my
      head. Surfal must have seen the note Jracol left in one of the taverns.
      Then Jracol must have encountered him before he left. With a two day lead,
      Surfal would be there by tomorrow. &quot;Fyodor, there is no time to lose!
      We have to stop him.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Hybrow smiled a twisted grin. &quot;Suddenly I am
      beginning to suspect this trip is going to be worth my time. Why don't you
      explain why we must stop Surfal from helping the people of Highhold,
      Jhared?&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">As I told them the story of my father and Carson McCabe,
      I felt their moods take a turn for the worst. It was no secret that Fyodor
      considered Surfal his pupil. When I recounted the battle with Jracol,
      Fyodor smiled to hear that the ranger had fared so well against the Dark
      Elf. But when I showed them the note, they both understood.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Fyodor immediately went into action. &quot;We'll need
      transportation. We'll never catch Surfal on foot.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Hybrow shook his head. &quot;There isn't a wizard in
      this entire region who could teleport any further than West Karana. Our
      best bet is to hire a Bard.&quot;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">I knew that bards were thought to be the ultimate
      traveling companions. I hadn't thought to use one now, but Hybrow was
      right. With a Bard's songs, we might reach the Pass by tomorrow night.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="2">Fyodor took off in the direction of Qeynos. &quot;I'll
      return with a Bard. You two try and find Grannith. We'll need that little
      blockhead for sure.&quot;</font>
