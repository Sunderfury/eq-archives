  <p>Morning could not come soon enough. Though the nightmares were less vivid,
  they still haunted my sleep. As was usually the custom, Fyodor was already
  awake and had a small fire burning. As I think back over the past few nights
  it seems he is always the last to fall asleep and the first to rise. I am not
  even sure if he does sleep. Being alone, I asked him to show me more ways to
  dodge my opponent’s blows. He noticed that my skill was now average and
  before long I might actually get good at it.</p>
  <p>As the others began to stir I started to scout the immediate area. No more
  than a short run from our encampment I saw I saw a light shimmering in the
  distance. I also was quick to notice that wherever the floating light went it
  left a small swirl in the dirt. As I approached it my ears began to buzz with
  its noise. The noise reminded me of the Bixies in the Misty Thicket. </p>

  <p>The orb darted at me and I dodged to the left. I was unsure if it was
  playing or attacking but I wasn’t in the habit of taking chances these days.
  I took my bronze sword from its sheath and began chanting my snare spell.
  Success, the creature was moving at half its speed but as I swung at it my
  blade glanced off it’s shimmering light. Twice more I tried and failed but
  its light was stinging me and burning me at the same time. I retreated two
  steps and swung a forth time. My blade struck true but did no damage, then the
  horror of reality struck me, this orb was invulnerable to my blade. Another
  searing jolt of pain and my left side went numb. Fyodor, he would know what to
  do.</p>
  <p>I turned and sprinted as best I could toward camp but another jolt rocked
  my lower back. I was on the ground and stunned. Had I come all this way to
  perish like this, like some snake on the ground? Another jolt and I was barely
  able to maintain conscience thought. I braced as best I could for the
  deathblow when I heard a battle cry. I expected to see Fyodor but it was the
  Halfling Root. I tried to warn him that the orb was invulnerable but his staff
  was actually doing it harm. However, the orb was still on top of me and I knew
  my time had drawn to close. I heard a clank of a sword bouncing off the
  magical being and saw Fyodor taunting it off me. The world faded away.</p>
  <p>Time passed, how much I cannot say but the sun appeared to be past its
  zenith. Root explained that what I had attacked was a wisp, or Will o Wisp as
  they are called in the Commonlands. It is invulnerable to all but enchanted
  words and weapons. That explained how I was able to cast snare on it but not
  harm it with my blade. I looked at Fyodor and asked if his blade was magical
  but of course I knew it wasn’t. His arms were covered with marks from the
  orb; once again he placed himself at great personal risk for me. I turned to
  Root and asked if he killed it.</p>
  <p>&quot;It was Jhared&quot;, he stated, &quot;He summoned a magic hammer and
  beat the thing down&quot;. Sure enough he was holding a lightstone in his hand
  for me to see. Apparently once the life force leaves the Wisp it hardens into
  a lightstone. I am fortunate that I learned the wisp’s tracks for now I can
  hunt them for my friends, and avoid them when alone.</p>
