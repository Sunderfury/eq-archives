<h1 align="center">Bobs' Software Collection </h1>

<p>A few tools I've found useful (or fun, or interesting) are
stored here. Currently, all are Win32 programs (<a
href="http://www.intel.com/">ix86</a>, of course ;-), and work
fine on Windows NT and Windows95. Some of these will run on
Win32s if you have the right version of Win32s, wsock32.dll, etc
(e.g., AR.exe and WizUnZip.exe have been run on Win32s). </p>

<p>This stuff came from various ftp sites, CompuServe, AOL, etc,
and some are my own creations. You have been warned ;-) Most are
directly available from this page, some are links to other sites
(especially large files; easystreet only lets me have 5MB ;-) </p>

<p>If you take copies of any of these, please <a
href="mailto:rbkweb@home.com">let me know</a> (just for my
curiosity). If you have interesting/useful software you'd like me
to try and possibly list here, or if you find later versions, <a
href="mailto:rbkweb@home.com">let me know</a>. </p>

        <p>I've written this utility to make it easy to post
        reminders to myself with a reasonable GUI. You configure
        it with the SMTP server of your choice, who to send mail
        to (and a few more things), and it sends E-mail with
        subject <strong>AR: &lt;your text goes here&gt;</strong>
        (the <b>AR:</b> prefix is configurable). Based on public
        domain code (<a href="blat11.zip">blat11.zip</a>; a
        simple SMTP client), re-worked to be more modular and
        reusable. Freeware. Last updated: <a href="ar-v14.zip">v1.4</a>
        1/7/97 (adds ability to translate 8.3 file names to full,
        long, case preserved names, when invoked by dropping file
        names on a shortcut). Previous version: <a
        href="ar-v13.zip">v1.3</a> 2/10/96 (added <i>always on
        top</i>, <i>save dialog position</i>, <i>drag &amp; drop</i>
        from file manager or explorer, and a bit of cleanup). </p>

        align="left" border="0" hspace="2" width="209"
        height="145"></a> How often have you wanted to get the
        full pathname of a file, but file manager and explorer
        don't let you, so you wind up actually <i>typing</i>
        parts of the name? For me it was too often, so I wrote
        this little utility to help. Very simple usage: drag file
        name(s) from file manager or explorer and drop on this
        program, and the names will be copied to the clipboard.
        If more than one name is given, they are placed on
        separate lines when pasted into a document. Freeware. New
        version (<a href="clipnm13.zip">v1.3</a>; 1/7/97) adds
        ability to dynamically alter direction of path name
        slashes and put multiple names on a single line, via
        keyboard controls (see the help file for details).
        Previous versions <a href="clipnm12.zip">v1.2</a>
        (4/10/96; added automatic conversion of 8.3 file names
        into full long, case preserving, names). <p>Check out a
        real nice review at <a
        href="http://www.sharewarejunkies.com/8c3/clipname.htm">Shareware
        Junkies</a>; thanks, folks! </p>

    <dt><a href="nice.exe"><strong><i>Nice</i></strong><strong>
        Command</strong></a></dt>
    <dd>Win32 command-line utility to run another command at low
        priority, similar to the UNIX command of the same name.
        Nice (no pun intended ;-) for running long running makes
        (e.g., <i>nice make all</i>), or other computationally
        intense programs while not killing interractive
        responsiveness. No documentation (there are no command
        line switches ;-) Added 4/10/96. </dd>

    <dt><a href="savescrn.exe"><strong>Screen Saver Launcher</strong></a>

    <dd><a href="savescrn.exe"><img src="saveme.gif" align="left"
        border="0" hspace="2" width="32" height="32"></a>
        Launches screen saver immediately (no Ctrl+Alt+Del/Lock
        Workstation), and locks screen if the screen saver is
        configured password protected. Real nice when used with
        various launchers (eg, RipBarPro), and as a shortcut on
        the Win95 desktop. Very simple program, source available
        (public domain, source on CIS and CICA). </dd>

        src="lemmy.gif" align="left" border="0" hspace="2"
        width="32" height="32"></a> Very nice shareware editor,
        emulates the UNIX <strong>vi</strong> editor and adds
        syntax coloring for a variety of languages (inluding C,
        C++, Java). Well worth the registration price. As I
        recall, it's usable non-registered but you'll like it
        enough to register it. Added 10/10/2000 (should have
        added long before this).</dd>

    <dt><a href="pfe0602i.zip"><strong>Programmers File Editor</strong></a>

    <dd><a href="pfe0602i.zip"><img src="pfe.gif" align="left"
        border="0" hspace="2" width="32" height="32"></a> Very
        nice freeware editor. MDI, lots of possible key bindings,
        various customizations, edits DOS or UNIX files (and can
        convert), etc. I use this instead of notepad on both NT
        and Win95. New version <a href="pfe0602i.zip">6.02</a>
        (10/14/95) adds some nice new features. More information
        is available <a
        href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/people/cpaap/pfe/">from the
        author</a>. There is also a 16-bit windows version, and a
        Power PC NT version (boo, hiss! ;-) </dd>

    <dd><a href="http://www.execsoft.com/"><img src="defrag.gif"
        align="left" border="0" hspace="2" width="30" height="30"></a>
        A very nice freeware (30-day evaluation) disk
        defragmentation utility for NT 4.0 (released version, not
        beta). The freeware does analysis and defragmentation of
        FAT and NTFS volumes. Must be run manually; the $$
        version can be run in the middle of the night as an NT
        service (or so the docs say). I tried this on my PPro NT
        4.0 desktop at work, and it worked just fine, defrag'ing
        my FAT and NTFS volumes with no problems. Added 9/19/96. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a name="NTCrond"></a> <a href="http://www.ifdef.com/"><strong>NT
        Cron Daemon</strong></a> </dt>
    <dd>This shareware does a good job of implementing UNIX-like <b>cron</b>
        functionality, including different user ID's per job.
        Runs as an NT service. Works with NT 3.51 and NT 4.0
        (betas and release). There is a nice graphical interface
        for managing cron jobs. I've registered this, use it to
        run middle-of-the-night backup scripts, and it works
        great. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a href="ipname.exe"><strong>IP Address to Name</strong></a>
    </dt>
    <dd>Win32 command line utility, sort of a DNS lookup. Takes
        one or more numeric dot-notation IP addresses on the
        command line and attempts to generate the name for each
        address. If only one address given, just prints the name;
        otherwise, it lists the IP address and the name, one per
        line. Useful in shell scripts to map addresses to names
        (e.g., in processing HTTP server logs). Added 4/10/96. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a href="nslookup.zip"><strong>DNS Lookup For NT</strong></a>
    </dt>
    <dd>This is a usable version of <strong>nslookup</strong> for
        Windows NT. It's a Win32 console application, works (sort
        of) like nslookup on UNIX systems. Be sure to set up the
        default name server as noted in the readme.txt file. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a href="zip.exe"><strong>NT zip</strong></a> and <a
        href="unzip.exe"><strong>NT unzip</strong></a> </dt>
    <dd>I finally found a 32-bit zip binary (console app) that
        handles long file names and preserves filename case.
        Matching unzip also included. This stuff is public
        domain; source code is available. See <a href="#wizunzip">WizUnZip</a>
        for a freeware 32-bit GUI unzipper that (mostly) works. <p><a
        name="wizunzip"></a> </p>

    <dt><a href="wizunzip.exe"><strong>Win32 Unzipper</strong></a>

    <dd><a href="wizunzip.exe"><img src="wizunzip.gif"
        align="left" border="0" hspace="2" width="28" height="30"></a>
        Win32 version of freeware Win16 unzipping utility. I
        ported this in early 1994 as an exercise in playing with
        VC++. Not 100% functional (I've not had the time to fuss
        at it since the original port), but necessary things work
        (and the price is right ;-). <strong>Much faster</strong>
        than the Win16 version (can be 5X on large .zip files).
        Source (maybe) available. </dd>

        align="left" border="0" hspace="2" width="30" height="30"></a>
        One of the nicest archive management tools I've used.
        Supports drag &amp; drop, good integration with Win95
        interface (runs great on NT also). Shareware, well worth
        the registration price. Understands .zip, .tar,
        LZ-compressed files, and lots more. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a href="ps.exe"><strong>NT Process List</strong></a> and
        <a href="kill.exe"><strong>NT Process Kill</strong></a> </dt>
    <dd>Extremely useful process listing utility (gives UNIX-like
        <i>ps</i> output), complete with process ID's, current
        virtual size &amp; working set, %CPU, etc. Win32 console
        application. Companion app <i>kill</i> can kill processes
        given their process ID's. Both are freeware, I've been
        using them for <i>years</i>. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a href="clckr12a.zip"><strong>Middle &amp; Right Mouse
        Button Control</strong></a></dt>
    <dd>I use this to bind my middle mouse button to
        double-click. Almost as nice as Logitech's mouse
        utilities, a few glitches but very useful. Got a new
        version (5/2/95), adds chording support and ability to
        target bindings to application. <em>(freeware)</em> </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a href="http://www.ftpx.com/"><strong>FTP Explorer</strong></a></dt>
    <dd><a href="http://www.ftpx.com/"><img src="ftpx.gif"
        align="left" border="0" hspace="0" width="50" height="50"></a>This
        is a real nice FTP client (nicer than the one below,
        IMHO). Displays an explorer-like view of the remote site
        files, can transfer hierarchies of files, can transfer
        multiple files concurrently, and can resume interrupted
        transfers. Freeware (shareware for commercial use). Added
        11/11/97.</dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a href="ws_ftp32.zip"><strong>Win32 GUI FTP Client</strong></a>
    </dt>
    <dd>This is an easy to use Win32 GUI FTP client. Also
        understands ftp proxy servers. Freeware. There is also a
        Win16 version. </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dt><a href="d4time41.zip"><strong>Time Synchronization</strong></a>
    </dt>
    <dd>Nice freeware tool to synchronize your systems clock with
        that of an SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) server.
        Works nicely on Win95 and NT. I use this at work every
        time I log in on my NT desktop system; works great! Added
        9/20/96. </dd>
