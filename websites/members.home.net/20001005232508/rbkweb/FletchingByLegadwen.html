<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

<p>This text attempts to collect my thoughts and knowledge on
fletching and bow making in the land of Norrath. As a master
fletcher of some skill, I have made alot of arrows and many
different types of bows, and have researched information about
both of these. I hope this information helps you in your
journeys.</p>

<h2 align="center">Background</h2>

<p>There are many types of bows that can be made, and many types
of arrows. Even the most basic hickory staff bow is better than
store bought, and it doesn't require much fletching skill to
make.</p>

<p>To use a bow (archery): put your bow in your range weapon
slot. Put some arrows in your ammo slot. Put your <em>range
attack</em> button somewhere on your hotkeys. Then, while <em><strong>not</strong></em>
in auto-attack mode, target something and hit your range attack
button. You hear the pluck of the bow and see the arrow head
towards its mark. If your archery skill is high enough, you get a
hit! If not, you lost an arrow (unlike Ultima Online, you cannot
pick up arrows that missed, nor do arrows that hit appear in the
loot of your kills). If you are too close to or too far from your
target, you will be informed.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In order to improve your archery, you must attack
    creatures that will yield experience. Picking on poor light
    green creatures won't help improve your archery skill.</p>
    <p>Don't buy a quiver. You can put arrows in any container
    you carry, and these will feed your ammo slot. A quiver is
    not necessary. When and if a quiver can be put in your ammo
    slot, they will become much more interesting.</p>
    <p>You can now hit magic creatures with any bow firing magic
    arrows. Arrows summoned by a mage are supposed to work. I
    have no personal experience with this, but have received
    enough credible evidence to trust it. Also, arrows made with
    the new <em>silver tipped</em> arrowhead (these used to be
    the <em>bladed</em> arrowheads) can hit and damage magic
    creatures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Total possible damage from an arrow hit is the bow damage plus
the arrow damage. After level 20 strength and level modifiers can
yield extra damage. Rangers and Warriors can also score an
occasional <em>critical hit</em>, which roughly doubles thier
highest hit at maximum damage.</p>

<p>Maximum range of an arrow shot is the range of the bow plus
the range of the arrow. This was not always true, but was fixed
in a patch. A bow with good range firing arrows with good range
can hit a target a long way off (maybe further than the maximum
spell casting distance).</p>

<p>Both arrows and bows are made in a fletching kit. This kit now
has 8 slots (via a recent patch, to accommodate making bows with
multiple cams), and is lightweight, so it now makes sense to
carry it with you. Be careful to <strong>NOT</strong> hit <em>combine</em>
with your treasures in the fletching kit, or you will loose them!
I tend to keep cheap arrows in mine, so if I do hit <em>combine</em>
by mistake, I haven't lost much of value.</p>

<p>Classes that can use bows are: Ranger, Paladin, Warrior,
Rogue, Shadow Knight.</p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Bowerying Basics</h2>

<p>Quality (damage / delay ratio, and range), cost, and skill to
make a bow increases as the bow staves: <em>hickory</em>
(easiest, cheapest, a few gold for the staff), <em>elm</em>, <em>ash</em>,
<em>oak</em>, <em>darkwood</em> (hardest, most expensive, over
225pp for the staff).</p>

<p>There are 3 kinds of string: <em>hemp</em>, <em>linen</em>, <em>silk</em>.
Hemp yields most damage, highest delay. Silk yields least damage,
least delay. There is little cost difference among these. Any bow
staff can be combined with any of the strings.</p>

<p>To make a basic (or <em>rough</em>) bow: put a bow staff and
string in your fletching kit. Cross fingers and hit <em>combine</em>.
If you succeed, you get a new bow. If you fail, you loose the
staff and string.</p>

<p>Fancier bows: starting with elm, you can augment the bows when
making them by using tools. Elm bows can be carved. Ash bows can
be carved or shaped. Oak bows can be carved or shaped and
optionally cammed. Darkwood can be carved or shaped and
optionally cammed with one or two cams. Better string, tools, and
cams improve the bow by lowering the damage it delivers and
lowering the delay of the bow such that the damage / delay ratio
is improved.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Linen string lowers damage by 1, lowers delay by 4.</li>
    <li>Silk string lowers damage by 2, lowers delay by 8.</li>
    <li>A <em>whittling tool</em> lowers damage by 1, lowers
        delay by 4.</li>
    <li>A <em>planing tool</em> lowers damage by 2, lowers delay
        by 9.</li>
    <li>A <em>cam</em> lowers damage by 1, lowers delay by 5.</li>
    <li>A <em>rough</em> bow used no tools when it was made (just
        the staff and string).</li>
    <li>A <em>carved</em> bow is made with a whittling tool.</li>
    <li>A <em>shaped</em> bow is made with a planing tool.</li>
    <li>A <em>cammed</em> (1-cam) bow is made with a bow cam.</li>
    <li>A <em>shaped cammed </em>bow is made with a planing tool
        and bow cam.</li>
    <li>A <em>compound</em> bow is made with 2 bow cams (only
        possible with darkwood bows).</li>
</ul>

<p>The damage / delay effects of the tools and strings are
cumulative. So if you make a carved silk bow, you subtract 2 + 1
(3) from the damage, and subtract 8 + 4 (12) from the delay, of
the equivalent rough bow with hemp string.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>For example, a rough elm bow with hemp string has damage
    13 and delay 51. To make a carved elm bow with a silk string
    (the fastest bow available): put an elm staff, whittling
    tool, silk string in your fletching kit, pray and hit <em>combine</em>.
    If you succeed, your carved elm bow is damage 10 delay 39.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Typically a tool isn't used unless cheaper components
providing their benefit (delay reduction) are also used. For
example, you would not make a shaped bow with hemp twine, as a
silk string could have improved the bow almost as much for a few
silver (instead of 35pp+ for the cam). So before you use any
tool, be sure you're already using silk string. Before using a
cam, be sure you're already using a planing tool.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://eqforge.com/ranger/">Rangers Glade</a> has
<a href="http://eqforge.com/ranger/guides/bow-damage.html">a nice
chart</a> of most kinds of bows, their parts costs, and damage /
delay information. The following chart lists the range, damage,
and delay of a rough recurve bow made with each kind of bow staff
and hemp string. Range is not affected by choice of string or
tools, while damage and delay are affected as noted above.</p>

<p>Fletching skill to make various bows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Hickory: pretty low. As I recall, almost any fletching
        skill can make a hickory bow.</li>
    <li>Rough Elm: possible at 55 or so, trivial at 70 (maybe
        lower).</li>
    <li>Carved Elm: not sure when possible, trivial at 102 (I
        didn't make these until my skill was over 120).</li>
    <li>Rough Ash: possible at 101, trivial about 128.</li>
    <li>Rough Oak: possible about 150 to 155, trivial at 168
        (probably lower).</li>
    <li>Rough Darkwood: possible about 175 to 180, never trivial.
        Some highly experienced fletchers suggest not trying
        darkwood bows at all until fletching skill 200 (the
        maximum). My first attempt at a rough darkwood bow was at
        fletching skill 180, and I succeeded on the second try.</li>
</ul>

<p>Choice of string doesn't seem to make much difference in the
necessary skill. However, making carved, shaped, or cammed bows
takes more skill than making rough bows. </p>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Arrow Fletching</h2>

<p>Now you have a nice bow you made or bought from me ;-) You
need something to shoot from it.</p>

<p>To make arrows: buy arrow parts (4): point, shaft, fletch or
vane, nock. Place one (only) of each into your fletching kit,
cross fingers and hit <em>combine</em>. If you succeed, you made
5 arrows; if not you lost the components.</p>

<p>At first, buy the cheapest components (6cp/each, or 24cp per
attempt, but you get 5 arrows if you succeed (just under 5cp per
arrow)). With some +CHA items you can make this 5cp each
(20cp/attempt) or 4cp / arrow. These arrows are 1 damange, 50
range. Very nice for the price and better (and cheaper) than
store bought.</p>

<p>At about fletching skill of 16, these arrows become <em>trivial</em>.
This means you don't get any more skill points trying to make
them. This does NOT mean you cannot fail when making them (you <em>can</em>
and <em>will</em> fail, but the number of failures goes down as
your fletching skill increases). You can still make them,
however, and I use these most of the time due to cost. To improve
your fletching skill, you need to upgrade one or more of the
components you use to make arrows (see <a
href="#howToMasterFletching">how to master fletching</a>).</p>

<p>Different arrow parts affect damage and range, with
approximate costs (with good CHA) are given below. A base arrow
is made with Field Point, Wood Shaft, Round Nock, and Large
Fletch. It has 1 damage and 50 range. </p>

<p>For example, to make damage 2 range 100 arrows, the cheapest
combination is field point (5cp), bone shaft (79cp), large nock
(5cp), and parabolic fletch (26cp), for a cost of about 115cp for
5 arrows (23cp per arrow).</p>

<p><strong>(*): </strong>When making arrows with silver tipped
arrowheads, you make a set of 10 arrows instead of 5. These
arrows can be used to hit and damage magic only creatures. Silver
tipped arrowheads were called <em>bladed</em> arrowheads in the
past, before the patch that enabled fletcher made arrows to hit
magic only creatures (Jan 2000).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> when using a vane to make an arrow, the
vane is used <em>instead of</em> the fletch. Don't try to use
both, it's unnecessary (and may not work). Be careful with vanes,
since they look like arrow shafts (they have the same inventory
icon).</p>

<p>A nice chart of the names of different arrows may be found <a

<hr>

<h2 align="center"><a name="howToMasterFletching"></a>How to
Master Fletching</h2>

<p>Make arrows. Make more arrows. Make lots more arrows. Do not
try to improve your skill by making bows (it's <strong>much</strong>
cheaper to make the arrows). Make the cheapest arrows that don't
tell you they're <em>trivial</em>. <a
href="http://eqforge.com/ranger/">The Rangers Glade</a> has a <a
href="http://eqforge.com/ranger/guides/fletch-cheap.html">very
helpful chart</a> for this purpose.</p>

<p>When the arrows you're making become trivial, move to the next
combination of arrow parts. These will be more expensive. Most of
these arrows you will sell back to a merchant, since they're too
expensive to use. Best price tends to be at your guild hall, but
you might experiment.</p>

<p>For example, with fletching skill 150, the arrow parts to make
one set of 5 arrows that might increase your fletching skill cost
about 1p4g (with good CHA and faction). That's almost 3gp per
arrow (assuming no failures). Compared to 5cp per cheapest arrow,
this is a big difference. These can be sold to a friendly
merchant for 2g5s per arrow (with good CHA and faction). You will
not make money on this. However, some high level arrows can be
sold back to a merchant for a profit if you have good CHA and
faction. For example, field point, wood shaft, large nock,
ceramic vane arrows cost 2797cp to make (for 5), and can be sold
for 638cp (each; 3190cp for 5) to a merchant, about a 14% profit.
It doesn't take many failures to offset any profit you might
make. These are the cheapest arrows you can make to improve your
fletching starting at skill 162 (and they will take you all the
way to the maximum fletching skill of 200); at least there's some
hope of not spending all your plat on your fletching.</p>

<h2 align="center">Bow Recommendations</h2>

<p>Some of these are my own recommendations, others (particularly
darkwood) are from fletchers more knowledgeable and experienced
than I. I have heard of a very nice ranger only bow called <a
href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics12/Wind_Saber.html"><em><strong>Wind
Saber</strong></em></a>, but no details on where to acquire it.
If you have any information about this bow, please <a
href="mailto:legadwen@home.com">let me know</a>. There are some
other <a
href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/bows_special.html">very
nice bows</a> available.</p>

<p><strong>Rough Hickory </strong>for starting lower level
characters (cheap).</p>

<p><strong>Rough Elm with hemp string:</strong> for young
archers. Damage 13, delay 51. Max damage of 14 with cheap arrows
is nice, reasonably fast, not very expensive. Once I could make
these, I used these until I could make ash bows.</p>

<p><strong>Carved Elm with silk string:</strong> for someone
serious about raising their archery skill quickly. Damage 10,
delay 39, the fastest bow in all of Norrath. You can shoot alot
of arrows more quickly with this bow, more chances to improve
your archery skill. Not too expensive. Doesn't hit very hard
though.</p>

<p><strong>Rough Ash with hemp string:</strong> 16 damage (thus
max 17 damage with cheap arrows) is very nice. Downside, delay of
58 is a bit slow, but this is the bow I used until I made myself
a trueshot. It's nice to get that non-melee hit for 17 ;-) More
expensive (34pp retail) but a very nice bow.</p>

<p><strong>Rough Ash with silk string:</strong> 14 damage (max 15
with cheap arrows), but delay 50 is faster than rough elm. Nice
tradeoff of speed and damage. This is a popular bow.</p>

<p><strong>Carved Ash with silk string:</strong> 13 damage, delay
46. Even nicer tradeoff of speed and damage. This is also a
popular bow.</p>

<p><strong>Shaped Ashwood with silk string:</strong> 12 damage,
41 delay, range 100. A nice upgrade from carved elm for much
lower price than an oak bow. Almost as fast as carved elm, hits
harder, better range.</p>

<p><strong>Rough Oak with silk string:</strong> damage 19, delay
57, range 125. Hits alot harder than rough ash (dmg 16), a little
faster, and better range. Much more expensive, though.</p>

<p><strong>Carved Oak with silk string:</strong> damage 18, delay
53, range 125. Very nice combination of damage and speed (hits
harder and faster then rough ash). Even more expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Shaped Oak 1-Cam bow:</strong> damage 16, delay 43,
range 125. A great upgrade from shaped ashwood.</p>

<p><strong>Rough Darkwood:</strong> damage 25, delay 68, range
150. Very popular with high levels who use the bow just for a
one-shot pull rather than root &amp; shoot or snare &amp; kite
(since it's slow). Much more expensive than oak bows.</p>

<p><strong>Shaped Darkwood 1-Cam bow:</strong> damage 20, delay
46, range 150. Similar to the trueshot but with longer range.
These were popular with high levels for root &amp; shoot (or
snare and kite), but has recently been superceeded by the ...</p>

<p><strong>Shaped Compound (2-cam) Darkwood bow:</strong> damage
19, delay 41, range 150. Very expensive. High damage, very fast,
very good range. These bows have better damage / delay ratio and
range than trueshot bows. It is now possible to make these bows
(at very high fletching skill) due to the patch that made the
fletching kit 8 slots.</p>

<p><strong>Trueshot: </strong>(if you can make it, are rich and
can afford it, or have a friendly high level fletcher friend):
Ranger only, damage 20, delay 45, range 100, LORE. High damage,
very fast. For rangers this is a wonderful bow: cast snare on
your poor unsuspecting target, then <em>kite</em> it (keep your
distance, since it's moving slowly), and fill it with arrows that
really hurt. Downside: ranger only, a pain to make due to some NO
DROP items necessary in its construction (it's a quest bow), and
it requires very high fletching skill to make.</p>

<h2 align="center">A Few Words About Trueshot Bows</h2>

<p>The <a
href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics/Trueshot_Longbow.htm"><em><strong>Trueshot</strong></em></a>
Bow is a wonderful, ranger only, bow: damage 20, delay 45, range
100, LORE. A Trueshot bow can now be upgraded to a <a
href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/graphics7/Rain_Caller.htm"><em><strong>Raincaller</strong></em></a>
bow (damage 20, delay 45, range 200, +6 STR, +6 DEX, 5 charges of
FireStrike) via a <a
href="http://eqforge.com/ranger/guides/raincaller.html">high
level quest</a>.</p>

<p>The Trueshot bow is made from a bow staff that is the result
of a quest given by Maeson Trueshot in the ranger guild hall in
Kelethin. Once the staff is obtained, Maeson will tell you the
components needed to make the bow. You need a highly skilled
fletcher to make the bow. Some of the components required to get
the staff and then make the bow are NO DROP, making this harder
to do.</p>

<p><strong>Quest to get the treant bow staff (spoilers):</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>You need treant wood chips from Jyle Windshot, a spool of
    dwarven wire (NO DROP), a micro servo (NO DROP), and a
    spiderling silk. Ask Maeson Trueshot 'how do I gather
    materials'. He gives you a pouch with 4 slots. Put one piece
    of the wood chips, one spool of dwarven wire, one micro
    servo, and one spiderling silk in the pouch, and hit <em>combine</em>.
    Give the resulting pouch back to Maeson Trueshot and he'll
    give you some faction, experience, cash, and a treant bow
    staff.</p>
    <p>The staff is LORE but not NO DROP. Thus it can be traded.</p>
    <p><strong>To get micro servos:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>In Steamfont mountains, kill rogue clockworks (both
        the large ones near the mino caves and the smaller ones
        in front of the windmills), and runaway clockworks
        (typically near the newbie area by the kobolds). With
        luck, you'll get a microservo. I'd say you get one in
        about 6 or 8 of these kills. The micro servos are NO DROP
        but they do stack.</p>
        <p>Alternative: auction 1pp or so if folks will let you
        loot one of these creatures that contains a micro servo.</p>
        <p>This is tedious and time consuming. It's a real shame
        these are NO DROP since it's a pain to collect them.
        Higher level characters running around killing very green
        creatures doesn't make sense from a quest or role playing
        point of view (IMHO). It would be much better just to
        auction to buy them from newbie's in steamfont. It was <em>fixed</em>
        to be this way in a patch a while back (sigh).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>To get dwarven wire:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Get kiola nuts from the merchant near the docks on the
        sister isle (first stop out of freeport on the boat).
        They cost about 1g7s per nut. The nuts don't stack (each
        nut takes an inventory slot).</p>
        <p>Get merchant-bought flasks of water from any merchant.
        Get the same number of water flasks as kiola nuts. Do NOT
        use foraged or summoned water, it will not work. There is
        a merchant that sells water in one of the small buildings
        outside the Kaladim gate.</p>
        <p>In Kaladim (one zone in from Butcherblock), find Tumpy
        Irontoe (in a pub called <em>Irontoes</em>). Give Tumpy
        one kiola nut and one water flask (at the same time). He
        will give you one tumpy tonic. The Tumpy Tonics stack.</p>
        <p>Now head deeper into Kaladim (same zone as the Kaladim
        bank, 2 zones in from Butcherblock). Find Trantor Everhot
        - he is usually inside the building called 'Everhot's
        Forge' (I think that's the name), or walking between the
        area by the bank and the forge building. Hail him, and
        give him two (2) of the tumpy tonics, and he will give
        you one (1) spool of dwarven wire. The dwarven wire is NO
        DROP, but it stacks.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>To get the treant wood bits:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Buy small lanterns anywhere (there are shops in east
        freeport, they cost a bit under 7sp each).</p>
        <p>Find Jyle Windshot in West Freeport. He is in a room
        upstairs at the <em>Hogcaller's Inn</em> in West
        Freeport. Give him one lantern and he'll give you one
        wood chips. The wood chips stack, the lanterns don't. The
        wood chips are neither LORE nor NO DROP.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>To get spiderling silk:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Kill any small spider you see. You killed alot of
        these when you were a newbie ;-)</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To make the bow:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The bow is made by putting the treant bow staff, one spool
    of dwarven wire, one micro servo, and a standard bow making
    planing tool (about 11pp-12pp at bow parts vendors) in a
    fletching kit, pray to Tunare, and hit <em>combine</em>. If
    you succeed you get the bow, if you fail you get the planing
    tool back but loose the rest of the components.</p>
    <p>Since the dwarven wire and micro servo are both NO DROP,
    the fletcher doing this must obtain these items themselves.
    You can help by giving the fletcher the staff and tumpy
    tonics. Given the tumpy tonics, the fletcher can take a trip
    to Kaladim and turn them into dwarven wire (takes time, but
    is a bounded activity). The fletcher must get the micro
    servos personally (a real pain, see above). Giving the
    fletcher the staff means he has to hunt down one less micro
    servo.</p>
    <p>It takes considerable fletching skill to make the bow. I
    have succeeded once at fletching skill 106 (a very lucky
    fluke, I think), once at 132, once at 150, and twice at about
    161. I have fizzed many other attempts, but I'm hoping that
    with skill over 170 and 91 WIS via jewelry, I'll fizz less
    often. At fletching 161, I succeeded about once in four
    tries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, for one attempt at the bow, you need two micro servos,
two spools of dwarven wire (thus 4 kiola nuts and 4 flasks of
water), one piece of wood bits, one spiderling silk, and one
planing tool.</p>

<h2 align="center">Other Hints and Tricks</h2>

<p>Don't buy a quiver; they are not useful yet (you cannot put it
in your ammo slot). Rather, put arrows in your ammo slot, and
more arrows of the same type in any container you're carrying.
When your ammo slot runs out, it leaves one arrow in your ammo
slot and starts drawing arrows from your inventory. You don't
need a quiver to do this.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><em>[When and if Verant updates quivers so you can put
    them in your ammo slot, then quivers will be much more
    useful. Until then, don't bother.]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Increased <strong>INT</strong> should help your skill in
fletching improve faster.</p>

<p>Increased <strong>WIS</strong> should improve your success
rate at making bows and arrows.</p>

<p>Increased <strong>CHA</strong> should improve prices. My
experience is that any CHA over 90 for a wood elf ranger yields
best prices in Kelethin (additional CHA doesn't seem to help).</p>

<p>If you have the <em>sneak</em> skill, you can approach a
merchant who is less than <em>indifferent</em> to you (e.g., <em>dubious</em>,
<em>apprehensive</em>) and trade with them at better prices (or
trade with them at all). Approach the merchant in a direction
from which they cannot see you. Go into <em>sneak</em> mode. If
you /con the merchant, they should appear indifferent. If not,
either sneak didn't take hold or the merchant saw you approach.
If the merchant is indiffernt, trade away.</p>

<p>Many people assert that bow and arrow parts prices are better
in Surefall Glade than in Kelethin, especially if you have killed
alot of the gnolls in the area (and improved your faction with <em>Protectors
of the Jaggedpine</em> (or some such)). This has not been my
experience, but I am a wood elf who has not spent much time in
Blackburrow. A recent patch improved faction with some of the
Kelethin merchants, including Merchant Neaien (who is now amiable
towards me), thus the cost difference should be lower or gone.</p>

<h2 align="center">Locations of Arrow Part Merchants</h2>

<p>In the beginning, there were only two places that had
merchants selling all arrow parts: Kelethin and Surefall Glade. A
patch created more such merchants (in most cases, the merchants
sold some arrow parts in the past, but not enough of them). This
was a welcome change, since there are now more and more
conveniently located arrow parts merchants.</p>

<p><strong>Kelethin</strong></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Merchant Lanin:</strong> one platform north of the
    Priest of Discord lift, at location 407, 325. Merchant Lanin
    also sells the fletching kit.</p>
    <p><strong>Merchant Tiladinya:</strong> in <em>Trueshot Bows</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Merchant Neaien:</strong> in the <em>Fletcher</em>
    building, same platform as merchant Lanin.</p>

<h2 align="center">Suggested Bow Prices</h2>

<p>Costs listed are my costs in Kelethin with +CHA items. In most
cases, the cost to make is a slight overestimate (rounded up to
the nearest gold or plat).</p>

<p>Costs are given per attempt. The <em>retail price</em>
reflects prices I (and others) often get for the bows. The <em>guild
/ friend</em> price attempts to pass thru costs at very little
profit, and reflects failures; this price is typically
considerably lower than would be payed at (e.g.) a trade bazaar,
or from a random player /auction'ing the bows. An alternative
that some people prefer is to pass the bows through at cost for
guild mates and good friends (i.e., just hit <em>combine</em> for
your friends). The suggested guild / friend price for darkwood
bows assumes cost plus a donation (they cost too much to make to
try to balance cost fairly, donation is to compensate your time).
These are only guidelines, your approach may vary.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>For example, over time I have observed that I make rough
    ash bows about 2 out of 3 attempts. As my skill has
    increased, my success rate on ash bows has increased, but
    I've spent a virtual fortune getting the skill higher, so I
    think it's a reasonable tradeoff.</p>
