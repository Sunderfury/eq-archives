<h2 align="center">Bob Becks' Plastic 'Didj Recipe</h2>

<hr>

<p><img src="images/line_didj_left.gif" alt="didg player"
align="left" hspace="2" width="72" height="47">If you've ever
thought about trying out a 'didj but not spending much <strong>$$</strong>
for one, this page is for you! You can make a (very) inexpensive,
yet usable, plastic 'didj for a parts cost of <em><strong>less
than $5,</strong></em> and all parts can be found at almost any
hardware store! The nice thing about a plastic 'didj is that it's
cheap (a good price), you can take it lots of places and not
worry about it getting damaged ('cause it's cheap), and you can
make more if desired ('cause it's cheap ;-) If and when you
decide you really like playing the 'didj, you can spend a few
more bucks on a real one (good wooden ones can be found for $200
- $400, some for more, so you want to really know you'll keep
playing before you shell out the big bucks).</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>One 4 foot (approx) piece of 1.5&quot; ABS pipe (the
        black, lightweight, PVC-like piping). An inch or so
        longer is better than an inch or so shorter, but anywhere
        around 4 feet is fine. I have one that's 4'6&quot;, and
        it works fine (the tone is a bit lower, maybe a little
        harder to play). I think anything between about 4 feet
        and 4.5 feet is probably fine. The folks at most hardware
        stores will cut the pipe for you. I like the black ABS
        pipe better than the white PVC pipe, since it's lighter
        in weight and I think it looks better unpainted.</li>
    <li>One 1.5&quot; to 1.25&quot; <em>female trap adapter</em>,
        for use as a mouthpiece. A 1.5&quot; to 1.25&quot; <em>male
        trap adapter</em> can work also, if that's all you can
        find.</li>
    <li><em>Optional:</em> a curved ABS pipe joint (30 degrees or
        less), if you like, for the <em>bell</em> end of the
        'didj - this is <strong>not necessary</strong>, and may
        add $1.50 or so to the price. I like it for looks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Assembly:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>This is the <em>hard</em> part: stick the female trap
        adapter on one end of the pipe, the curved joint at the
        other end (if you bought one), and start playing!</li>
    <li><em>Optional:</em> Some people like to remove the end of
        the female trap adapter and dip it in beeswax, to make a
        more natural and comfortable mouthpiece. Feel free. I
        haven't done this to any of my plastic 'didj's.</li>
    <li><em>Really Optional:</em> If you're really ambitious, you
        can paint your 'didj to make it look nicer. I have yet to
        do this, but have seen some for sale for $50 or so that
        look real nice (they don't play any better than your $5
        'didj, though ;-)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/line_didj_right.gif" alt="didj player"
align="right" hspace="2" width="72" height="47">If you'd like one
that's more portable, you can buy ABS adapter joints (don't know
what they're called offhand), cut your ABS pipe into whatever
size pieces works for you (you need some kind of ABS pipe cutting
tool), and assemble with the joints (<strong>don't glue!</strong>)
Works fine; I have one cut into 1 foot pieces which is easily
disassembled and fits into my back pack. Great for business
trips, company picnics, campfires, trips to the in-laws, etc. ;-)</p>
