<h2 align="center">Bob Becks' Personal Interests</h2>

<hr>

<h2 align="center">Computer Gaming</h2>

<p>Lately I am very enamored with <a
href="http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/">EverQuest</a>. This
is a fascinating massively multi-player online role playing game
(RPG) that is quite addictive. Don't say I didn't warn you... I
play as <em>Legadwen</em> (a Wood Elf Ranger), who has a few
things to say about <a href="FletchingByLegadwen.html">fletching
and bow making</a>, and finding your way around by <a
href="EQHeading.html">understanding EverQuest Headings</a>. The
folks at <a href="http://www.eqvault.com/">EQVault</a> liked my <a
href="FletchingByLegadwen.html">fletching guide</a> enough that
they used it as they basis of their <a
href="http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/tradeguide/archery/">guide
to archery and fletching</a>.</p>

<p>I often play <i>action</i> <a
href="http://www.gamingworld.ziff.com/~gaming/">computer games</a>.
I've most recently been playing <a
href="http://www.heretic2.com/">Heretic II</a>, <a
href="http://www.planethalflife.com/">Half-Life</a>, <a
href="http://www.unreal.com/">Unreal</a>, <a
href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">Quake II</a>, <a
href="http://www.activision.com/games/action/hexenII/index.html">Hexen
II</a>, and <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">Quake</a> (but
it's been a while for Hexen II and Quake). I limit myself to
games that play on Windows NT, since I refuse to run Win95 and
Win98 at home; odd (maybe), but enough good ones run on NT and I
don't have enough time to play them all anyhow ;-)</p>

<p>For another fascinating experience in an online virtual world,
you should consider <a href="http://www.owo.com/">Ultima Online</a>...
this is definitely <strong>not</strong> an action game, but has
captured and held my interest longer than any other game I've
ever played. It's also an interesting social experiment (to <strong>PK</strong>
or not to <strong>PK</strong>; <em>that</em> is the question ;-)
I play as <em>Xang Tnrax</em> on the Baja server, generally in
and near the town of Vesper. Check out <a
href="http://www.adelaide.net.au/~nene/bp/index.htm">The
Adventures of B0N3D00D and pLaTeDeWd</a> and <a
href="http://imanewbie.crossroadsrpg.com/">ImaNewbie does
Britannia</a> for a fun glimpse at the <a
href="http://www.owo.com/">Ultima Online</a> environment.</p>

<p>Games I've enjoyed in the past include <a
href="http://www.tombraider.com/">Tomb Raider</a> (gotta love
Lara!), <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/duke3d.html">Duke Nuke'm
3D</a>, <a href="http://www.interplay.com/website/homepage.html">Descent
II</a> (a nice improvement on Descent, including more 'bots, more
weapons, more graphics modes, great cut scenes and background
music), <a href="http://www.ea.com/osi/crusader/crusader.htm">Crusader
No Remorse</a>, <a href="http://www.tds.net/raven/html/hexen.htm">Hexen</a>
(a nice twist on the DOOM engine), <a
href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">Doom &amp; DoomII</a> (of
course), <a href="http://www.tds.net/raven/html/heretic.htm">Heretic</a>,
<a href="http://www.interplay.com/website/homepage.html">Descent</a>,
<a href="http://www.apogee1.com">Terminal Velocity</a>, <a
href="http://www.lucasarts.com">Dark Forces</a>.</p>

<h2 align="center">Musical Interests</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.nd.edu/~sborman/didjeridu/"><img
src="images/line_didj_right.gif" align="right" border="0"
hspace="0" width="72" height="47"></a><a
href="http://www.nd.edu/~sborman/didjeridu/"> </a>I've been
learning to play the <a
href="http://www.mills.edu/LIFE/CCM/DIDJERIDU/index.html">Didjeridou</a>...
an Australian Aboriginal instrument, basically a hollowed out log.
It's amazing all the varied sounds that can be played on a 'didj
by someone who knows what they're doing (no, that's not me (yet)).
There are a number of folks around Portland who play, and a <b>Didj
Jam</b> thursday nights at Australian Originals in downtown
Portland (the Didj Jam has been on hold for a long time now (sigh)).
</p>

<p>Otherwise, I mostly listen to rock music, with a preference
for what's now called <b>Heavy Metal</b> (e.g., AC/DC, Metallica,
White Zombie, Aerosmith, Motley Crue, lots of others), but Pink
Floyd and a host of others are also interesting. </p>

<h2 align="center">Kite Flying</h2>

<p>I also enjoy stunt kite flying, mostly at the Oregon Coast. My
current favorites are a <b>Shadow Phantom</b> for finesse flying,
and a <b>Kid Eager</b> for fast high wind flying. Others include
a 2-stack of <b>8' Cyborgs</b> (by Mike Sterling of Portland), a
6-stack of <b>6' flexi's</b>, a <b>RevI</b>, and a host of others.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Other Interests</h2>

<p>My wife and I enjoy the local theatre in Portland. We
regularly attend performances at <b>The Portland Repertory
Theatre</b> (now defunct), <b>The Artists Repertory Theatre</b>,
and <b>Triangle Productions</b>. </p>

<p>We're also avid <a href="http://www.blazers.com/">Portland
Trailblazer</a> fans. Let's hope they start playing better! </p>
