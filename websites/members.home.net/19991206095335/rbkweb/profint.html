<h2 align="center">Bob Becks' Professional Interests</h2>

<hr>

<p>I am a co-founder of<a href="http://www.webridge.com"><img
src="logos/W6Trans.gif" alt="Webridge, Inc." align="absmiddle"
border="0" width="98" height="20"></a>(a software startup in the
Portland area). There is now some publicly available information
about what we're doing; see the <a href="http://www.webridge.com">Webridge
web site</a> for details. </p>

<p>I previously worked at <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel
Corporation</a> (2/95 - 3/97), in the Application Components Lab
(ACL), part of the Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) in Hillsboro
Oregon. I was involved with a variety of things related to the
Internet, and was fortuneate to become expert with the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> language and environment. My
last project was <a
href="http://labtoys.hbtn.portland.or.us/Idm20Worlds/docs/public/">Intel
Distributed Moo 2.0</a>, an infrastructure for creating
multi-user distributed applications. This infrasturcture
leverages features of Java to support highly dynamic multi-user
environments. </p>

<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.sequent.com/">Sequent Computer
Systems</a> (1/83 - 2/95), where I was a co-founder of the
company. At Sequent I was a key contributer to their <b>Symmetric
Multiprocessing</b> version of UNIX (<b>DYNIX</b>), and in later
years was involved with <b>Object Technology</b> (lots of
Smalltalk, C++, RDBMS, and OODBMS work). </p>

<p>Before Sequent, I was with Intel, where I worked on <b>RMX/86</b>
and did Intel's first UNIX implemention (Xenix/86). </p>

<p>I hold a BS and MS in Mathematics from <a
href="http://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>
(1975), and a MS in Computer Science from the <a
href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin, Madison</a>
(1977). </p>

<p>I have published a number of papers in Operating Systems and
Object Technology areas, and have taught classes in Object
Oriented Programming. </p>

<p>A somewhat dated (6/20/96) resume is available <a
href="resume.9606.txt">here</a>. I am not actively seeking other
employment opportunities at this time; however, if you have the
perfect position, feel free to contact me. <!--
While I'm not actively seeking other employment, if you have the perfect
opportunity available. I'll talk to you.
