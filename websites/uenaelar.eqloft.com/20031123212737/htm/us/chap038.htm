	<b>Myrdhin :</b><br>
	
	<font size="+1"><b>H</b></font>is back against the bar, Uenaelar’s eyes was focused on the picture window that gave a large view on the lake. A bit puzzled, he was seeing in his mind the sweet face of Lorine, the warrior he had met two days ago in the commonlands. How could a human woman have a so strong effect on him.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>A</b></font> light rubbing brought him back to the reality. Cursing this instant of weakness, he looked at the creature sat in front off him… a half elf !!<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>he drow took a questioning look at the barman who told him in dark elvish… <br>	
	<i>“Her name is Myrdhin, she’s come in town since one week”</i><br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>he half elf was staring at Uenaelar with arrogance. He was about standing up when she took a dagger out of her boot. Holding on the dark elf straight in the eyes, she took the dagger on her long legs, her chest, then on her delicate lips.<br>
	<i>“ Sometimes, the death can be sexy baby. However it’s still the death… so will you take the money out ?”</i><br>	
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>he barman had became pale. The temperature seemed to have decreased in the bar. Uenaelar’s eyes had taken a purple color. Myrdhin came closer to the shadowknight who hadn’t moved, in a light step, a velvet glance. She slipped down her strip on the right cheek of the drow, then on the left one, the pressure became stronger… <br>
	<i>“I hate waiting baby, hurry up !”</i><br>
	<font size="+1"><b>A</b></font> look at the stunned barman could have told her about the danger, but her look was focused the drow’s one…<br>
	<i>“You know baby, you’re good looking, but this isn’t the moment to be sweet. Give me the money and I let you go”.</i><br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>he dark elf say a word and pain twisted in Myrdhin’s head who was about fainting.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>S</b></font>he tried to use her dagger to threaten the drow, but her gestures had become so slow !<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>he dark grabbed the dagger and flattened the head of the half elf on the table.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>H</b></font>e said another word of power and an indescribable terror entered in Myrdhin.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>A</b></font>t this moment, the shadowknight knocked down the dagger, nailing the ear of the young rogue to the table.  <br>
	<font size="+1"><b>M</b></font>yrdhin understood that she could never sleep the mind in peace now, she would see the death in his eyes. The voice of the shadowknight whistled slowly as she was getting unconscious… “ a gift from Uenaelar”.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>he shadowknight got up. He dropped a platinium coin on the bar…” For the room”.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>H</b></font>e started to cast and vanished in the shadows…<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>he barman couldn’t trust what he was seeing. He approached close to the half elf and tried to take out the dagger. It was totally frozen !<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>H</b></font>e cleaned and bandaged the wound, then he took the young rogue to a bedroom in the second floor. As he was closing the door, he was still asking himself how this women who had challenged one of the most powerful lord shadowknight in Neriak, could still be living…

	<b>VELIOUS</b> - report from Uenaelar, 21st day in April , year 3200<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>M</b></font>aster,<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>F</b></font>ollowing your orders, I’ve made investigations on the new continent which has recently been discovered by pirate gnomes. So the boat took me to the dock in small island Iceclad.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>A</b></font> fast visit of the island made me discover un pirate gnomes camp. This island is also traveled by snow cougars. These animals can become very dangerous is group.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>his first island is linked to a second one by plates of ice. I’ve discovered in this one a dark tower of black ice and made of spikes. This tower is protected by Shadow Gardians, sort and snow dervish. The information that I got about this tower is the following one:
	<ul>
	<li>The tower is seven to nine floors high  
	<li>It is inhabited  by undead, something you’ll like I guess ! 
	<li>he owner of the tower would be someone named Tserinna.
	</ul>
	<font size="+1"><b>B</b></font>est this thing I can tell you is to take a better look at this tower.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>A</b></font> third island is linked to the second one by some ice plates. Those plates are inhabited by snow Gnolls. These ones can become very useful ally with us. I’ve started some negotiations with their chief, they’re now waiting for our emissaries.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>he third island a larger, I’ve discovered a teleporting site on this one. The island is traveled by huge wolves with red eyes. They are very dangerous opponents that can destroy a full group of adventurers. I was surprised to find there some Ice Giants. Two of them was guarding a huge bridge of ice lost in the ambient fog. I had to kill two guards in order to go over the bridge. I’ve walked a little farer on the bridge and I have entered a zone name Eastern Wastes by the settlers. I’ve traveled everywhere in the zone and here are the information I have collected: 
	<ul>
	<li>The entry of the ice giants city is located south east in the zone. 
	<li>In the north east, there is a narrow pass in the mountain, which leads to the Great Divide zone.  
	<li>The giants have built a fort located in about -1700, 2900. 
	<li>The Orcs in Velious are named the Ry Gorr. They have a fort in the middle of the zone. 
	<li>Inside the fort, there is a teleporting orb which take you to the Crystal Caverns,  full of snow spiders, tentacles and Geonides, sort of stone men. 
	<li>An Orc camp, located at the right of the bridge, contains an Oracle that give xp to the highest adventurers, so this is a very famous spot.
	<li>The zone is traveled by Mammoths, Rhinoceros, wolves, Morse men. 
	</ul>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>his zone, as everyone in Velious, is full of powerful items that you can loot on the mob’s corpses. The orcs especially, seems to have some very interesting armors. Here are a few examples:  
	<ul>
	<li>Orc Fang Necklace : AC5, STR3, STA3, AGI3 
	<li>Orc Fang Earing : AC3, STR3, HP15 
	<li>Ry Gorr Coiff : AC13, STR3, Mana15, SVmagic3 
	<li>Ry Gorr Chain Legging : AC13, DEX2, STA2, HP5, SVcold5, SVmagic3 
	<li>Ry Gorr Plate Arm Guard : AC11, AGI3, HP10, SVcold5, SVmagic3 
	<li>Ry Gorr Chain Collar : AC9, STA4, Mana10, SVmagic4 
	</ul>
	<font size="+1"><b>M</b></font>oreover, those armors are magic ones and have different looks according to the one that hold it.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>A</b></font>n important colony of dwarf named COLDAINS seems to be present on the continent.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>hey don’t seem to be agro, I’ve been able to talk with some of them.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>D</b></font>espite, this colony must be attacked an destroyed in order to raise our objectives, cause there is a detestation between the giants, the Coldains and the dragons in Velious.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>I</b></font>n order to be able to contact the dragons, we’ll have to kill some coldains to become friendly with giants, and then kill some giants and coldains to be finally able to meet the dragons.<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>I</b></font>’ve been able the find the Coldain’s city which is located in Great Divide. I’ll go there tomorrow to get informations as you ordered me.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>L</b></font>et me tell you now about Myrdhin. This chosen girl, is protected by our organization since she has been discovered, but she seems to have fallen in love with a rogue named Sikander. So, I’ve immediately ordered to intensify the surveillance in order to protect her from potential dangers linked to this relation. I have also contacted Sikander to threaten him a bit, I hope that he has understood the importance of this business, but I doubt it.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>N</b></font>ow I’ll tell you about subject that you must have heard about. I wanna tell you about the link between me and the human Lorine. This sensation is new for me, but I strangely don’t try and don’t want to escape it. I feel the affinity with her growing day after day. I don’t know where it will take me, but I want you to know that in spite of anything that could happen, my soul is in your hands and I’ll never betray our cause. Innoruuk himself seems to accept this relation, cause I feel his power growing in me during the fight deal.
