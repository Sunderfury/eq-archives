<img src="../../img/lettrines/w.png" width="19" height="19" border="0" alt="">e arrive to Neriak entry, and very quickly we take out our pass. Léantil who has been to long is immediately attacked by the guards… A minute later, we’re escorted by a “dragoon” inside the city. We leave here the poor Léantil’s corpse, however I had told the editor that it was a mistake to bring a wood elf cameraman in Nériak.<br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/n.png" width="19" height="18" border="0" alt="">eriak is a wonderful city ! Everything is sharpened in stone with art and decorated by fluorescent symbols, as in a nightclub. A few drows who are present in the city, look at us curiously, some of them insult us, but the Dragoon keeps them apart.
We now come in the merchant quarter of Neriak, at the bottom the lake, we can see the enlightened windows of one of the most famous bar in Norrath.
The opened door of an weapon smith let us look at some fabulous gleaming armors and artistically chased weapons.
We’re flabbergasted, everything here is beautiful , fine, art.<br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/w.png" width="19" height="19" border="0" alt="">hat a contrast with the inhabitant’s souls ! We’re now in a different zone, we all have a strange feeling of dread and calm.
We walk near a  large building from where we can hear some ritual songs in a tongue we don’t know. After we passed a small avenue,  the Dragoon tells us to stop. He looks a bit nervous and I quickly understand why… In front of us , there are some ghouls!!!<br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/t.png" width="19" height="19" border="0" alt="">he Dragoon tells us that it’s the necromancers guild’s entry, he won’t go farer, we have to wait here. So we wait nervously, the ghouls look at us with appetite, and I really don’t like it !<br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/s.png" width="19" height="19" border="0" alt="">uddenly, the temperature seems to decrease of several degrees, and we discern a form coming. <b>Uenaelar</b> materialize in front of us, he’s good looking with his dark metal armor. He greets and tells us to follow. We walk through the ghoul’s zone and we enter a magnificent building. Uenaelar leads us to a highly decorated room, where are fine trinkets and trophy (including a stuffed wood elf’s head). He lets us seat in large chairs and the interview starts:
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#660000"><b><i>Could you quickly introduce yourself for our readers ?</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/i.png" width="18" height="19" border="0" alt=""> am Uenaelar UTHMATAR, I was born in Neriak in Antonica island. I had my youth inside the city. Here I have learned the basis of weapons and the magic use. Later as was young shadowknight of first blood, I’ve been allowed go out to hunt in Nektulos forest. It’s here I have created the famous <b>RUN LIKE HELL</b> method.
Next, I’ve hunted in the commonlands, then I stayed a few month in Highold Keep, where I became a friend of the fortress’s captain. I also met my first adventurers friends. Later, exhausted of the avidity and narrow-mindedness of humans, I backed to Neriak and I’ve explored the dungeon of Nagafen, the great red dragon.
Now, I travel in Kurnak continent, with a preference for Karnor fortress.  
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#660000"><b><i>Venthril Sathyr has recently declared that you would have stolen his “Cobalt Boots”.</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/m.png" width="19" height="18" border="0" alt="">uhahahahahaha !! Venthril has always been dishonest. I’ve met him several times and I preferred not to attack him, luckily for him ! I’ve bought those boots to a “Sentry of Sathyr” ,Intera was present and will be able to prove it. I have offered the boots to my friend Tarquel, a great warrior. Venthril Sathyr should observe a little more his staff ! LOL!  
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#660000"><b><i>Before entering in Divine Grace, you were in Arakhne guild, why did you leave ?</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/t.png" width="19" height="19" border="0" alt="">his guild was too small for me, I needed a new one , more powerful to be able to explore plans and beam. But I’ve kept three loyal friends who were in Arakhne. Tarasmarr the leader, Kaldiin and Vinamin who’s now in Midnight Sojourn. I had all of youth with these three ones !! And now it would be hard for me to respect the rules of the queen spider. Speaking only in Dark elvish dosen’t help to get in a group of adventurers. And how to leave alive spiders when those ones attack you ? Divine Grace has become my family, here I have friends like Ombre or Intera and Tarquel, and all the other I forget, Nolas, Tchoover, Ethaniel, …. It’s maybe not the most powerful as those stupid from Da’kor but I like it.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#660000"><b><i>You seems not to like Da’kor, is it jealousy ?</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/n.png" width="19" height="18" border="0" alt="">o it’s not !! Da’kor is the most powerful guild in our world, but they’re so full of their power that it makes me sad ! I think that being the most powerful is bad for mind. That’s a pity , because there are some people I like in their guild.
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#660000"><b><i>You have quoted Intera several times. Isn’t he a paladin ? It can be seems strange to see you with this class. Some paladin are also said to be accepted in Neriak.</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/t.png" width="19" height="19" border="0" alt="">his is only a rumor, retailed by wood elf and druids !! Do you seriously think that paladins could move free in our guild ? Be serious !
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#660000"><b><i>And what about Intera ?</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/w.png" width="19" height="19" border="0" alt="">e became friends the day we fought together the “ Spectral Knight”. This day, our gos have blessed us… Good and evil are opponents, but they can ally in rare times, Intera and I prove it. I think that Intera won’t never come in Neriak, he won’t like the decoration ! Muahahahahah !!
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#660000"><b><i>You definitely hate the wood elves. Un wood elf defense council has also been created to try to make you stop this attitude. Can you say more about it ?</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/d.png" width="19" height="18" border="0" alt="">ruids and wood elves are cheaters ! They have a look of nature defenders and animals protectors, but they kill everything that doesn’t math their criteria. Isn’t a griffon an animal ? Isn’t it a part of our ecosystem ? And despite, they are killed hundred after hundreds in north Karana by druids. No, if you look for evil, liars and cheats just take a look at them !! And about this association, ask them who is giving us the money. I wouldn’t be surprised to find some inhabitants of Surefall Glade or this degenerated YABON ! 
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#660000"><b><i>What is your idea about Good and Evil ?</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/i.png" width="18" height="19" border="0" alt="">’m not one of these stupid who think that all is good or evil. I guess that good and evil are present in every events. Un necromancer who help a distressed adventurer makes a good or evil thing ? I’ll be conditioned of the opinion of the one who look that.   
Is killing an ogre a loyal thing for a paladin ? This paladin randoming an item with his group to sell it is right or not ? A druid trading a sow is really good ?
Are druids who invade Kurnak good ? I follow a god who venerate hate and blood, the power he gives me can sometimes seems cruel, but isn’t it cruel to dot a mob and let him die slowly as the druids and bards do ? I have hate for my enemy and I like to see their blood dropping but I also respect a loyal opponent or a friend, is it bad ?
<br>&nbsp;<br> 

<font color="#660000"><b><i>Have you ever been feared ?</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/o.png" width="18" height="18" border="0" alt="">f course, fear is good for senses, it makes the victory nice. I think that my best feared was the day I’ve been stuck at the bottom of bellafen. I was in the 13th blood and it’s a very bad memory. This day I thought I would loose all my items !
<br>&nbsp;<br>

<font color="#660000"><b><i>What are your topical projects ?</i></b></font><br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/i.png" width="18" height="19" border="0" alt=""> now observe the creation of a new guild, Les irreductibles. The members of this guild are all very good adventurers, I think they’ll get glory in the future. One of their members is Akhekoukou, I’m sure he’ll become a very powerful sorcerer. I’ve also been told by my guild to contact the dragons of Velious , but it’s a different kind of story…
