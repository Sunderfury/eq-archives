	<b>Tarquel’s Journeyman boots</b><br>
	<font size="+1"><b>Y</b></font>ou probably heard about my friend Tarquel the warrior. For a long time he was longing to have the same Jboots than me. So I decided to help him to get his. To get them, you need to respect these conditions:
	<ul>
	<li>Kill an Ancient Cyclop and loot his “Ring of the Ancient” (NO DROP)
	<li>Kill a Shadowman and loot his “Shadowed Rapier” (NO RENT)
	<li>And get 3250gp from a banker (robbery or regular withdrawal).
	<li>Then go to a gnome named HASTEN in Rathe Mountains and give him the items.
	</ul>
	First problem: to find an Ancient Cyclop. We camped the one in Desert of Ro for hours with Tarquel without spotting one. Tarquel heard about a spawn in the Ocean of Tears, we went there and we camped. A cyclop spawned! It’s not a named one, but enough to warm us up!
	I cast Darkness upon him and Fear. So the feared cyclop started running with us behind him striking him! But I realized too late what a mistake I did! The cyclop is running toward a Named one!!! Because this one felt responsible for the other one, he started helping his friend. Tarquel did not last long. I feigned death and both of them forgot about me.
	Later one, Tarquel retrieved his corpse and we started planning the next attack.
	<ul>
	<li>I cast Darkness on the Cyclop who starts attacking me.
	<li>When I had only 2 life bubbles left, I backed off and Tarquel taunted the monster. 
	<li>From a distance I started draining the Cyclop.
	<li>When Tarquel had 3 bubbles left, I came back to melee and we finished the monster.
	</ul>
	This tactic worked fine thereafter.
	Finally the Ancient Cyclop arrived!!! We rushed on him! Pif! Blam! Boum! This is a true barbarian! I was quickly at 1 life bub so I backed off to life drain him. During that time, Tarquel life was falling down and now pretty ugly to look at. I understood everything was going wrong for him so I came back to fight. Taunt, taunt, harm Touch, taunt! But the cyclop is sticked to Tarquel who fell down, dead.
	I finished the monster with 1 bub left! But the worst thing is that the ring is No Drop and Tarquel is bound at Freeport! Damn it! 
	Tarquel told me he knew a way to cheat so I looted it and wait for my friend who died twice for this ring!
	Now let’s go to Lavastorm mountains to kill some Shadowmen to get this rapier. Lucky day! We got it after 10 minutes. Tarquel dropped by the bank to get the 3250gp (gold is necessary!).
	So we headed to Rathe Mountains to meet Hasten! We arrived there but Hasten was not. Instead of him was a NPC called Brother Zethyl. This NPC conned red to me… pffff. 4 hours after, a drake spawned, we killed it. Then another one, we killed it as well, and so on. It was 3 am and I was falling asleep on my keyboard, I decided to camp. I had the rapier it was going to disappear if I camped but as long as I had the ring, it did not matter. I camped. 
	Dring, dring, my mobile phone rang! Tarquel was calling me IRL. “He is here, he is here, come on, don’t let me down!”. I assured him I did know how he felt and but I went to bed. Two days after, I logged in Lavastorm Mountains and I waited next to Shadowmen. 
	At the same time, Tarquel arrived in Rathe Mountains and told me that Hasten was there. Unfortunately, it took me 2 hours to get this stupid rapier! A druid ported me to the Feerott and I entered then Rathe Mountains! 
	Tarquel was waiting very sad, a guild just had killed Hasten! We talked with the guys and they accepted to spare the next Hasten so that we could to the quest!
	2 hours later he spawned.<br>
	So what was the trick?
	<ul>
	<li>I gave Hasten the Ancient Ring without clicking TRADE
	<li>Tarquel gave him the 3250 gold pieces and rapier without clicking TRADE
	<li>I clicked TRADE
	<li>Tarquel clicked TRADE and recovered the boots!!
	</ul>
	After all these hours, my friend had finally his own Jboots! HURRAY! Congrats my friend!
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<b>Die Hard- The remake (in Karana)</b><br>
	(3 act drama exposed by a newbie)<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>F</b></font>irst Act:<br>
	We were all on the hill near spires in North Karana. There are Personne the Shaman, Kalypsom the Mage, Iranne the attractive Druid, Senfout the Warrior and Akhekoukou the great Wizard. There is also Yabon, a druid who came to help his newbie friends (he is 24, we are 13). Everything was going A-ok for 1 hour: we are pulling Scythes and Griffawn with hardly any break. Suddenly, the drama! A griffon arrived from nowhere and started attacking Yabon. We all courageously fled to the zone leaving Yabon to his fate. The unfortunate druid died in 10 seconds, but all newbies were safe.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>S</b></font>econd Act:<br>
	Back on the hill! Yabon was looting his corpse when I saw from distance a Hill giant incoming straight on him. I came closer to the druid and tried to warn him: “Hail a Hill Giant!” “Beware Yabon, just behind you!!!”. The giant arrived and I ran. I looked back, the giant was just behind Yabon who was standing up and told me : “This griffon is so stupid to kill me!”. A second after the giant smashed Yabon like a potato. Between 2 laughs, I told Yabon that this giant seemed as stupid. He did not appreciate, consequently sulked.
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<font size="+1"><b>T</b></font>hird Act:<br>
	Iranne went pulling. Yabon had stopped sulking and came back to recover his corpse. Iranne sent us the following message: “Grif red”. Ok, it’s fine all griffawns are red to us. And we saw her arriving followed by a GRIFFON!!! She just ran next to us and we all believed she was going to zone!! Big mistake! Iranne had just lost track of the group! She found it back and brought the griffon to us! <b>RUN LIKE HELL!!!</b><br>
	In the following order:
	<ul>
	<li>The Griffon tore Iranne apart!
	<li>Yabon who was AFK had the same fate.
	<li>The griffon started attacking Kalypsom, he started fleeing and the griffon took 2 seconds to finish his pet. 
	<li>Unfortunate Kalypsom died just in front of the bridge.
	<li>Iranne reappeared just UNDER THE GRIFFON!
	<li>The griffon took a vicious pleasure to kill Iranne once again.
	<li>Finally, guards killed the Griffon!
	</ul>
	Conclusion:<br>
	Yabon died three times and lost a level, he sulked and did not even take his corpse back He logged!<br>
	Iranne died twice, Kalypsom once!<br>
	Iranne just understood the difference between a Griffawn, a Griffon and a Griffenne.<br>
	My belt hurt: I laughed so much!!!
