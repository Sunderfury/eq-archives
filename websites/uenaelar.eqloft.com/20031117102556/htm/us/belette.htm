<img src="../../img/lettrines/t.png" width="19" height="19" border="0" alt="">o all of you, who would innocently plan to offer Everquest to your companion, I today have to widely spread this warning: inserting Everquest in your home is a mad attitude !!
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Used from the start to see new games turning up at home, the arrival of Everquest did not, I must say, scared me beyond measure. A new games means 2 or 3 months, intensely lived indeed, but always followed by a period of respite, the time needed by manufacturers to make new concepts.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
So, a day Everquest has come in shop windows. At this moment, no problem. The problem is that he brought it. 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year…<br>
“hmm, tell me dear, this quest seems to be very long ? Ho ok, there’s no quest, and no end and that’s exactly all the interest of the game ? …”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/i.png" width="18" height="19" border="0" alt="">nsidiously, Everquest has taken its place, its habits, rubbed off in our schedule.
<br>&nbsp;<br> 
<b>Her</b> -  “what about going to the restaurant tonight ?”<br>
<b>Him</b>- “Actually, it seems to be difficult, I have an appointment for a raid at 9 o’clock pm”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Her</b> ( the next day, having stopped sulking ) -“So, was this raid nice ?”<br>
<b>Him</b> (yellow-belly) -“hmm, finally there was no raid, we wasn’t enough….”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Here you perfectly understand that things started to go wrong.<br>
Especially, that other problems had quickly come over that.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<b>Her</b>- “Don’t forget, tomorrow we’re going at François”<br>
<b>Him</b> ( the eyes focused on the screen )- “ok no problems”<br>
<b>Him</b> ( the next day at the morning )- “Hey, don’t you think that we haven’t seen François    for a long time ?”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
No comments….
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/y.png" width="19" height="18" border="0" alt="">ou’ll have learnt, that it’s today illusory that and information raise your dear and honey’s brain when he’s stupidly positioned in front of the screen.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
However, if the information would be linked to the game ( a day you want to crawl ), or better, if you show any interest signs for the actual adventure, in this case, no doubt that you’ll have the pleasure to briefly see a spark, and sometimes even a feeble flash of intelligence, and maybe to get a sensible answer.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Ok, let me comfort you, it’s just an habit to get, after it’s easy to manage: As the dying breath of the computer has rung, you jump to the post-it and you disclose in one time, without respiring, all the patiently repressed until now communication.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
About the «  air bubble » that an evening with friends could have bring, finished. They have all been indoctrinated ! Suffering during hours, all the subtlety of the game, up and down, where the narration, of the best moment of the previous day, that’ll be your new destiny. Let me warn you, any way to try to miss the conversation will be failure (you can imagine that I have tried ! ).  
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Finished too, are the “reading evenings” by two under duvet, you have to know… ( at 3 am I do not want to read anymore, I’ve been sleeping since a long time ! ) 
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/o.png" width="18" height="18" border="0" alt="">h, I forgot, one more detail…
<br>&nbsp;<br>
If unfortunately, the holy things is located in the same place of the television (and that’s of course right at our home…), don’t hope watching cushy a good movie :<br>
“AARGHHH, OORGHHH, EEURGHHH”, I don’t say anymore, the connoisseurs knows what I’m talking about.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
So, by now some good headphones, it’ll help you to avoid some exercises ( “could you lower a bit the sound please ?, “ can you lower the sound ?”, “Keep the sound down, I can’t hear anything ! )
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Ok I guess I have said enough….  
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<img src="../../img/lettrines/o.png" width="18" height="18" border="0" alt="">h, I was about forgetting the best !
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Imagine a day when you back from work very late and exhausted, you open the door, your honey 4 years baby get up on you, and tell you very proud : <b>“ mum, look that, dad created my character, he’s a warrior named Alecsandre !”</b>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Here, it’s simple, he finishes you off ..
<br>&nbsp;<br>
So, you’re now warned ladies. But if you decide to buy Everquest it means that you’re: a bit stupid, kind of idiotic, totally masochistic, or worse, <b>absolutely in love</b>
