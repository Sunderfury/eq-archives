	<b>FUNNY HISTORY :</b><br>
	<font size="+1"><b>R</b></font>ecently, I gave some stuffs to GHERTRUD, my friend troll warrior. I crossed desert of RO to deliver that to her  in Innothule swamps. Arrived in South RO, I perceive "ANCIENT CYCLOPS"!! This Cyclops drops the ancient ring, a very rare object (and NO DROP) who allows to obtain the first-rate Journeyman boots. With these boots, you can run very very fast and avoid losing a lot of time (without speech of the possibility to escape the monsters more easily !!).<br>
	I rush so to him with the firm intention to kill it so that an another char can loot the ring (I already have the boots). I arrive on him to perceive that it is already attacked by two other players... The Cyclops collapses and I congratulate the two accomplices for their exploit. The one which names VANCE is quite happy and he says to me that he was waiting 117 hours for this Cyclops!! <br>
	Yes all right but??? Why don't he loot then??? (Your favorite Drow says to himself) I understand that it is not VANCE who killed the Cyclops, but his friend and that they are not grouped. So VANCE must wait fort the Cyclops to be lootable for everybody to be able to take the ring (which I call back is NO DROP)... GNIARK!!! MUHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA!!!<br>
	I begin then trying to loot the Cyclops myself by making right clicks for 20 clicks per second!!! YEAH!!! I am the first to loot and I stay in position WITHOUT taking the ring, that blocks VANCE who can not any more loot (and which cannot know if I took the ring). <br>
	Extracts from the log :<br>
	Uen - LOL!!<br>
	Uen - I am so evil!!<br>
	Uen - Nice ring, thanks VANCE...<br>
	Uen - Muhahahahahahahahahahaahah!!<br>
	Vance - Oh god, don't do that man!<br>
	Vance - If you take this ring, you deserve all your guild...<br>
	Uen - MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!<br>
	Vance - gargleeeeee!!<br>
	And there, I stop to loot and I leave VANCE to take the ring. I do not fail to congratulate him for its future boots. Ha ha ha ha!!! He must have been scared to death!!! I would have much given to see the head of this fellow in front of its keyboard, he must have eaten his mouse!!!
	<br>&nbsp;<br>
	<b>OLD SEBILIS :</b> <br>
	<font size="+1"><b>C</b></font>heck, I begin little to bore in Karnor, then I decided to loaf in OLD SEBILIS. A wizard accepts to teleport me in the Emerald Jungle. From there, I reach Trakanon Teeth, where is the ancient city of SEBILIS. I arrive in the hall where is the teleport globe. This globe requires a "key" to be activated, kind of statuette obtained in Trakanon Teeth by killing Frogloks and by giving two pendants to an emperor ghost (level 60 +)...
	I activate the key to find again me in a small aisle. There is a group of adventurers there who clatter against a big Froglok, that calls back me GUK. Lads of my guild are also there and I integrate the group. Small preciseness, it is impossible to go out by the way in, so it will be necessary to find an exit or "Gate". We advance in the tunnel which comes down, it is very beautiful, a sort of cave cut here in the cliff... We arrive on a stony bridge, there is a group which camps here. Some Frogloks we met are all level 50+, that incites to be careful...
	 We cross the bridge and we settle our base of the other side, in a small cave. Far off, I perceive a great white entrance, the members of the group say to me that the exit is this way, it is well to know it! A strange rustling makes me jump. I hate this noise!! Our puller (for one time it is not me!) return towards the group pursued by one enormous beetle!! The " SEPSIS BEETLE " looks like the SolB's Death Beetle, but he is big as a Grizzly!! The fight begins...
	Ouch!! Have!! Ouille!! This mob knocks as a locomotive! I have just taken 141, 143 and 125 in two seconds, fortunately that Ombre (my favorite cleric) looks after me... During the battle, I move back a little to resume my breath "You don't escape me Uenaelar!" The beetle just summoned me and I meet myself just in front of it... Bang, Bam, Plaf! After a relentless fight of two minutes thirty, the beetle collapses died... They are hilarious in the group. "Then Uen, it liked you that one", "They have to love the Drow's meat". I ignore them and I prepare a coffee by waiting for the next monster...
	The next comes, a big brown golem " SEBILITE GUARDIAN " who seems also to like Dark Elfs in hamburger. During this fight, I was summoned several times by the golem, and my life was saved only thanks to some "Complete Heal" from Ombre...
	Golem was "White" for me, that means level 53! On him, we find a magic mask with several charges of " Superior Camouflage ", it is a beautiful present that I am going to make for my friend Tarquel. The poor man is a warrior and he can't make himself invisible. It is late and it is time for me to leave, I say goodbye to everyone and I makes me invisible, then on the way towards the gate of exit. In the way, I cross two Frogloks that I avoid attacking and RUN LIKE HELL towards the gate... Pfffffffffuitt!! And I am sanding in the room of the globe of entrance. It is time to camp, good evening...

	<b>THE HEROES : </b><br>
	<font size="+1"><b>A</b></font> golden page of the Kurnak's history was written yesterday, it tells the strange association of a Paladin and a Shadowknight. Everything began while my group rested itself beside Karnor's moats. The group is composed of a Wizard, a Cleric, a Warrior, a Paladin (INTERA) and your servant.<br>
	Suddenly, we listen echo of an almighty battle near the zone. A group attacked a "Spectral Knight", a particularly dangerous monster. The rumours of the crackles of bone that we hear indicate us that it happens badly at the zone, we rush in the rescue!! It is the bloodbath, there are already at least 3 lads on the ground. The rest of the group is zoning, and we remain alone with the Spectral Knight with two thirds of its points of life... BANZAI!!!<br>

The rest of the group is zoning, and we remain alone with the Spectral Knight at two third of its points of life... BANZAI!!! <br>
	We join battle then. The Knight hits very hard, it slashes for 150 !!! Suddenly, it is a disaster, the Knight just summoned our wizard, the poor guy die in é secondes under a rain of fatal blows. Soon our warrior is dawn, the cleric casts on me a "complete heal" and announce OOM (out of mana). He must have only 1/10 of his life points left, he zones.<br>
	
	And I stay only with INTERA in front of the Spectral Knight that is at 1/3 of its points a life... INTERA pushes his war cry and charge the Spectral Knight. The zone is not far, is it suicidal to stay there, he is a paladin, why to help him??<br>
	But perhaps today, our gods decided on a truce... The courage of this paladin seems to make raise in me of strange sensations, my hand wrinkles on the hilt of my sword and I charge also! Harm Touch, the Knight takes for 681 points, that makes it at once attacking me. The knocks rain, my bar of life seems to empty in a mad speed... INTERA casts on me all of his heal spells...<br>
	After a titanesque fight, the Spectral Knight collapses in our feet. We look at us with the paladin and we greet each other, under the cheers of the adventurers which have just returned in Karnor. I look at my bar of life, 5 %!!! INTERA is not better, but his face shines with enjoyment.<br>
	On the Monster, I find "BLACKJACK", a mace 1H blunt, 7damage and 23 delay. The monks can use it... Later, we random it to know who will keep the weapon. We are three in competition, the wizard, INTERA and me. I said to INTERA (who is in my guild, he he he!) that if I won the random, I gave him the mace... And it is the Wizard who wins!!! Our gods seem to have broken the truce...
