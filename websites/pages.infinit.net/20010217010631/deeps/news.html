<p><b>February 1rst</b><br>
  - Sorry for taking so long but I wanted to check most of the new drinks before 
  posting them. But I think some of the new ones are bug and we'll have to wait 
  for next patch to make them. So, I did a major update to recipe page. For the 
  drinks still unverified, I added the text from the brewing book, maybe you can 
  figure it out. If so, please e-mail me. Also, if you have some of my missing 
  trivial scores, please tell me. Happy brewing!</p>
<p><b>December 14th</b><br>
  - Added a Velious drink, see Recipe page. If you find more Velious drinks, please 
  e-mail me!</p>
<p><b>November 14th<br>
  </b>- Back online- my provider had a small problem with his web pages, all fixed 
  now <br>
  - Added the root beer in recipies<br>
  - Not much new in the world of brewing. Rumours are that Velious will bring 
  many new recipes, so pretty much status quo for now.</p>
<p><b><br>
  October 5th<br>
  -</b> Added many new recipes including some non alcoholic drinks. Many more 
  are still undiscovered, so test and e-mail me!<br>
  - Also, I foraged many Morning dews in GFay, so it's not that rare<br>
  - Made a few updates to the vendor page</p>
<p><b>September 25th<br>
  - </b>Added recipe for a new drink: Brandy!<br>
</p>
<p><b>September 22nd</b><br>
  - Added the Morning dew to the forage table. Starting getting info that it's 
  foraged in Lesser Faydark during dusk. But it seems to require high forage skill 
  (150+).<br>
  - Corrected the Moonlight temper recipe. Really sorry to those who missed it 
  with the old one.<br>
  - Added the Sea temper recipe<br>
  - Added a <b><a href="http://pub28.ezboard.com/bxyrielsbrewingboards">Message 
  board!</a> </b>Please visit and use it to your needs!</p>

  to Azariel Du'Starwolf for the info)</p>
<p><b>August 22nd<br>

  seems for Iskars)</p>
<p><b>August 15th</b><br>
  - Updated the forage page</p>

<p><b>June 2nd<br>
  </b>- Updated the &quot;Complete list of foraged items&quot; page with a list 
  I got from Stephen Knapp. This great list has many Kunark foraged items.</p>
<p><b>May 30th<br>
  </b>- Added &quot;What's new&quot; page<br>

<p><font size="2">Sorry for not updating the site sooner, I had quit EQ for 4 
  weeks. But weak elf that I am, I came back (*sigh* this really IS a drug). Also, 
  thanks to all who linked to my site, either on web sites or on forums. Though 
  I make no money with my site, it's still nice to see that others appreciate 
  the work I put in this guide.</font></p>
