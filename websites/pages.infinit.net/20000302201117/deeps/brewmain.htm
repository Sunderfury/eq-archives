  <p align="left">Well, you've come to the right place. I am Xyriel the druid, 
    of the Patriots of Norrath. In my home town of Kelethin, I used to be laughed 
    at by my fellow elves. &quot;Brewing is for dwarves&quot; they said. But deep 
    inside, I'm knew Wood elves make the best brewers. I'll tell you why later.

  <p align="left">By the way, I would like to thank all the brewers that wrote 
    me for updates and new info for the site. I have updated many of the sections. 
    Thanks all!<br>

  <p align="left"><b><font size="5" color="#000099"><a name="a"></a>What is brewing?</font></b></p>
  <p align="left">Brewing is a trade skill like smiting, fletching, jewelcraft 
    and others. In brewing, you make...well huh.. brews! Ales, wines, liquors 
    and other alcoholic drinks. It's not a very profitable skill but it's fun 
    and doesn't cost much to become master (less than 50pp).</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5" color="#000099"><b><a name="b"></a>Why is there 
    alcohol in EQ?</b></font></p>
  <p align="left">Basically, I'm not sure. Some drinks taken in large quantities 
    (or a few high alcohol drinks) boost your stamina and strength for some period 
    of time (or so I heard). But to be able to take that much alcohol and still 
    be able to think and walk, you need to rise your alcohol tolerance skill. 
    How do you do that? Well... you drink! You tolerance skill will go up as you 
    drink. Our guild leader, Rassal, now has 160 alcohol tolerance (thus his surname 
    &quot;The drunken Wizard&quot;).</p>
  <p align="left">There is however one drink (the Heady kiola) that is used by 
    tailors and you can actually sell to other players. But I wont give out this 
    tailor's secret here. Only the recipe for the Heady kiola</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="5" color="#000099"><b><a name="c"></a>How do I brew?</b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><img src="still.jpg" width="304" height="228" align="left">Brewing 
    is fairly easy. You need to find a <i>Brew barrel</i> or a <i>still</i> in 
    a city. All the major cities have one and it's generally (but not always) 
    located in or near a bar (see <a href="vendors.htm" target="main">Where to 
    buy</a> to know where they are). I haven't seen any difference between the 
    barrel and the still, they're the same device with different names.</p>

  <p align="left"><img src="stillbox.jpg" width="77" height="249" align="right">Once 
    you find it, you left click on it. A new window will open. There is 10 slots 
    box with a <i>Combine</i> button that will open. You put the ingredients in 
    the slots and press <i>Combine</i>. You'll get one of 4 things:</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li> &quot;You have fashioned a new item!&quot;, a drink (success!)</li>
  <li>&quot;You lack the skill to fashion the items together&quot;, which means 
    you miss</li>
  <li>&quot;Those items did not combine in those quantities to produce anything&quot;, 
    which means you have the wrong recipe</li>
  <li>&quot;You have become trivial at this item&quot;, which is explained later</li>
</ul>
<p><font size="5" color="#000099"><b><a name="d"></a>OK, I get it. But how do 
  I become Master!</b></font></p>
<p>To raise your brewing skill, the first thing you can do is put practice points 
  at your guild in this skill. However, the guild master can only train you up 
  to 21 skill. After that, you'll need to practice by making drinks over and over 
  again. After a few, your skill will go up 1 point. A drink recipe will raise 
  your skill until you have come too good a brewer for it. This is what we call 
  a &quot;trivial score&quot;. For example, your can practice your brewing by 
  making Kalish until your reach 31 skill. Then, you wont learn more about brewing 
  by making Kalish. You need to practice with harder drinks.</p>
<p>The harder the drink, the more chances you have to miss it. From what I've 
  seen, skill goes up faster with successful tries than failures (which is kind 
  of logical). So the trick is always to do drinks closest (but above) your current 
  skill to make it rise faster. In the previous example, the logical step after 
  Kalish would be Mead (it's trivial at 41 skill).</p>
<p>Once you've become trivial at a drink, it doesn't mean you'll always have success 
  with it. Once trivial, I've heard that your reach maximum probability which 
  is around 70% success. Look up the <a href="recipes.htm" target="main">Recipes</a> 
  section to see all trivial scores.</p>
<p><font size="5" color="#000099"><b><a name="e"></a>What are recipes and where 
  do I find the ingredients?</b></font></p>
<p>The recipes represent the items you have to put in the still to produce alcohol. 
  You can find all the recipes I know in the <a href="recipes.htm" target="main">Recipes</a> 
  section. As for ingredients, there are 4 groups. See the <a href="economy.htm" target="main">Economy</a> 
  section to find vendors:</p>
<p>Ingredients found in bars:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Casks</li>
  <li>Grapes</li>
  <li>Bottles</li>
  <li>Kiola sap</li>
</ul>
<p>Ingredients found in specialty shops (brew shops or vendors):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Barley</li>
  <li>Hops</li>
  <li>Malt</li>
  <li>Yeast</li>
  <li>Wine yeast</li>
  <li>Rice</li>
  <li>Spices (baking shop)</li>
  <li>Kiola Nut (shop in OoT)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ingredients only found with Forage skill (druids, rangers, bards and Wood elves):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Berries</li>
  <li>Fruits</li>
  <li>Veggies</li>
  <li>Morning dew</li>
</ul>
<p>Ingredients found in loots:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rat's ears</li>
  <li>Froglok meat</li>
  <li>Fire beetle eye</li>
  <li>Snake skin</li>
  <li>Spider legs</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need water flasks in great quantity. But this is a really common 
  item bought almost anywhere. One item require Fish, you can get a fish by either 
  Fishing skill, killing a fish in water (sometimes loots a fish) or buying it.</p>
<p>The hard part for most people are the foraged items. This is why I said the 
  Wood Elves are the best brewers. We are born with a basic 50 skill in forage. 
  Since most high skill drinks require foraged items, we have a great advantage. 
</p>
<p>That's it, now you're ready to start brewing!</p>
<p>Look up the other sections to help you minimize costs and maximize profit.

<p>See you in Norrath!</p>
