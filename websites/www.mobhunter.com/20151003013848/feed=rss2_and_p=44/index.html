		<description><![CDATA[Clearly, you have issues with Big Timmy&#039;s Burger Palace.  Perhaps Big Timmy&#039;s isn&#039;t the resturaunt for you, then.  Have you ever considered that the customers of Big Timmy&#039;s don&#039;t care how many customers go to Wally&#039;s World Burgers?  Perhaps the customerbase of Big Timmy&#039;s just prefers the flavor or atmosphere afforded by their resturaunt of choice.

Regardless, I fail to see where you&#039;ve backed your argument against Big Timmy&#039;s with anything more than your own personal opinions couched as fact.  Your personal preference, though noted, is truly only relevant to yourself.  If you believe that this information was necessary to post, I personally would have recommended you do so on the Wally&#039;s World forums as opposed to here.

Then again, what you have posted violates several Big Timmy&#039;s forum rules.  You utilize post hoc reasoning, ad hominems attacks, and several other logical fallacies in order to make your &quot;point&quot;.  

At the end of the day, when all is said and done, the choice is yours.  One day, when you have your own restuaraunt, you can run it however you like, but till then, you can continue to talk till you&#039;re blue in the face and the cows come home, and I don&#039;t know to break this to you but...and I just ran out of cliches.  Nevermind.  ;)

..

Great fun, Steve.  Absolutely wink-nudge funny.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would have been a much funnier parody if it left me laughing at the forum jerks rather than you. Its a little concerning that you seem to think that your product is really ok and the trolls just whinge because they love it so much.

Hungry Pete has been selling well over 10 times as  many burgers for the last year or so. If I worked at Timmy&#039;s I might just be slightly worried. Especially if one of the big bosses had just been forced out. Maybe all the Big Timmy&#039;s staff will get to keep their jobs. And watch all at Hungry Pete&#039;s enjoy media attention, nice pay and all that kinda stuff. 

Maybe you should spend your time working, MG, instead of authoring unamusing humour pieces.]]></description>
