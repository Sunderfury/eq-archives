We Have Two of Them</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-10-15</p><B>Thumbs Down: Aradune Exits, Stage Left</B><p><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=939812258">Brad left</a> Verant/Sony in a hurry. The timing is odd, to say the least, what with Luclin on the horizon and EverQuest 2 in development (deny it all you want, EQ2 <I>is</I> in development). So what's the real story?<p>We don't know, and likely won't ever hear the whole truth. So, at the risk of pissing off Smed and the rest of the Verant staff, let's speculate a bit.<p>Obviously, either Brad left of his own volition or he was forced to go. There are a few reasons he might want to take off right now: disenchantment with the Sony corporate structure, lack of faith in the Shadows of Luclin product, an inability to take future EverQuest products in the direction he'd like to go... the list could go on and on. But we don't really believe any of those.<p>Why? Unless Brad has the biggest shit-eating grin we've ever seen, he was pretty happy at Verant. It seemed like he had a lot of creative freedom, and everything about Luclin seemed on track.<p>So that leaves the notion that Brad was asked to go. Why is this seem a more likely scenario to us?<p>Well, Mobhunter had a little surprise in the works. Brad had agreed in principle to an exclusive interview with us. In fact, he had our questions in hand, and promised us his answers within a week's time. That was last week, just prior to the announcement of his departure.<p>Brad was nothing but straightforward and candid with us during the process of arranging the interview. I don't for one second believe that he intended to screw us over. I think if he intended to leave, he would have simply refused our request and been done with it.<p>That's pretty thin evidence, I grant you. If you know anything else--not something heard second-hand, but something you know for a FACT--drop me a <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">line</a>. I promise to keep the source confidential. Note: That offer extends to you, too, Brad.<p><B>Thumbs Up: Afterlife Kills Tunare</B><p>For the second time anywhere (we think), guild <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife</a> wiped out the matriarch of druids and rangers, Tunare. Which is all well and good, except...<p><B>Thumbs Down: Afterlife Gets (Remains?) Snotty</B><p>Give us a break and post the freaking loot. Yes, you are 733t d00ds and all, but get over yourselves; they're just bits in a hash table. Take Tigole's advice and post the damn things, or else don't bother. k thx bye.<p><B>Thumbs Up: Karanas Cleansed of Plague</B><p>The in-game event that's been going on for months regarding the plague in the Karanas has apparently come to a close. Details are sketchy since no one on the Verant quest troupe leaks scripts anymore, but we do know that the anticipated Plane of Plague did not open as many had hoped. Someone involved with the end of the quest on each server was awarded a very godly ALL/ALL <a href="http://www.abiplanet.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=1&amp;t=017041">breastplate</a> with <B>45 AC, 25 STR, 45 STA, 125 HP, 25 DR, 25 PR, and an effect that regens hitpoints and mana</B>. At 0.1 weight, monks like me are drooling--for the stats as well as the looks (it's like a blue Phase Spider Carapice). Grats to all those level 20 druids who have obtained them.<p><B>Thumbs Up: Chardok Revamp</B><p>The recent patch made Chardok a much nicer place for upper-level people to play. Very few roamers, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8376.topic">phat lewtz</a> galore, and an unbelievable experience bonus. With the quick respawn time, this zone can easily hold ten full groups camping various spots without conflict. When the zone population is low, it makes for a fast-paced dungeon crawl to get to the royals. Kudos to the Verant people behind this one.<p><B>Thumbs Down: No More Mobs to Kill</B><p>Reading uberguild Web pages these days is like being stuck in a <a href="http://www.tvland.com/schedule/schedule_nan/schedule/index.jhtml?day=&amp;zone=">Nick At Night</a> marathon of &quot;Three's Company&quot; episodes; whichever one you view, you get the feeling that you've seen it before.<p>We cleared NToV today... we cleared ST today... we woke the Sleeper today... yada yada yada.<p>Hey, did I just &quot;yada yada&quot; <a href="http://www.pornbomb.org/">cyber</a>? Yes, I think I did.<p>News flash: <B>Waking the Sleeper isn't news anymore.</B> In fact, it's about as interesting as a naked troll race on Vallon-Zek, so please <B>stop submitting stories about it.</B> I'm sure EQVault will happily post them, but we won't.<p>For the love of god, someone attempt Jaled-Dar's shade, or kill the Avatar of War again. Please!<p>We've got two months until Shadows of Luclin, boys. Dark Age of Camelot isn't likely to hold people's interest that long, so lets make the best of it. Hey, how about some more zone revamps, Verant? Droga and Nurga are ripe for uberfication.
