		<title>Moorgard Returns to E3</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m in California for the first time in years to attend E3. I haven&#8217;t been to the show since the height of its excess, before it was neutered. Though still manic and bombastic, it feels noticeably less chaotic to me. I have memories (now fond, at the time not so much) of being hoarse each [...]]]></description>

		<title>Designing for Three-Year-Olds</title>
		<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s very easy for game designers to come up with lofty, complex ideas. This is especially true for people who take a support role on one project and suddenly find themselves in charge of something on another title; they get the impulse to put their stamp on everything, to show the world how clever they [...]]]></description>

		<title>My Favorite Music of 2010</title>
		<description><![CDATA[On the whole, 2010 was a fantastic year for new music. A lot of my favorite bands released albums, and a whole crop of new artists showed up with awesome material. It was a struggle for me to name a single Album of the Year; for the first time since I&#8217;ve been doing this feature, [...]]]></description>

		<title>Back, Hacked, Do It Again</title>
		<description><![CDATA[This morning, I received an email saying my Battle.net account password had been changed. After resetting the password and logging in, my characters were naked. A petition to a GM followed, and this evening I got mail that my items had been restored--though my account was now locked.]]></description>

		<title>There Are No Truths&#8211;Only Perspectives</title>
		<description><![CDATA[The EA Louse blog is all the rage these days, and I&#8217;m sure anyone who visits this site will have encountered many observations on its content already. I can neither confirm nor deny the author&#8217;s assertions, though of course over the years I&#8217;ve heard my share of stories about the dark secrets of various game [...]]]></description>

		<title>Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I have not given up on blogging, despite all appearances to the contrary. It&#8217;s just that, well, I&#8217;ve been busy. Lots of great stuff going on at work. As you may have heard, we announced our first product and have been talking about it at various shows. I know many of you are anxious for [...]]]></description>

		<title>Save the Avatar, Save the World</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve heard about Blizzard&#8217;s RealID system, and have seen many of the opinions against the upcoming change to WoW&#8217;s forums. I think the move is lousy too, for most of the same reasons others have stated. I think ultimately the change is dangerous, both to the customers and to the health [...]]]></description>

		<title>PAXing East Coast Style</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Today I, as well as a throng of coworkers, descended upon the first incarnation of PAX East. Though there wasn&#8217;t an official 38 Studios presence (no booth or big announcements this year&#8211;sorry!), our execs were nice enough to give the team the day off to attend opening day of the festivities. First off, it&#8217;s great [...]]]></description>

		<title>Speaking at VR 2010 Conference</title>
		<description><![CDATA[On Tuesday, March 23, I&#8217;ll be speaking at the IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 Conference, taking place in nearby Waltham, MA. The panel is titled &#8220;Design for Experience?!&#8221; and if you look at the list of speakers, I am clearly the dumbest guy in the room. I can only assume they had some quota of locals [...]]]></description>
