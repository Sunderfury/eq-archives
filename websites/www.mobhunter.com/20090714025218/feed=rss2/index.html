			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Live is not sexy" href="http://www.eldergame.com/2009/07/08/the-warcraft-live-teams-b-squad/" target="_blank">Check out a great post</a> by Eric at Elder Game talking about the cycle a live game goes through as it matures and a new generation of developers comes aboard.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very true that a lot of game developers enjoy shipping a title and then moving on to the next. In the console world this is how it&#8217;s done, of course; the MMO universe operates as a live service after launch, which is something even many seasoned developers are not used to or interested in. So having people move on is an expected part of the process.</p>
<p>The first year after EQ2 launched saw a number of its senior people leave, either for new opportunities within SOE or to other companies. But since the game remained SOE&#8217;s flagship product for some time, the team still had ample resources and plenty of good people on board. And as <a title="because he posts about *everything*" href="http://brokentoys.org/2009/07/10/scott-hartsman-leaves-scott-hartsman/" target="_blank">Lum mentions</a>, <a title="one of the best" href="http://www.hartsman.com/" target="_blank">my friend Scott</a> proved an invaluable presence who led the team to make many popular changes to the game. (Oh, what might have been if only so many of the game&#8217;s formative years of development hadn&#8217;t been squandered&#8230; but what&#8217;s done is done.)</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who&#8217;s done a fair bit of it, fixing other people&#8217;s broken shit is not always fun. I&#8217;m not referring to the kind of stuff where a design decision was made one way and you&#8217;d rather take it another; I mean coming across something horribly broken and convoluted<strong> </strong>that unfortunately crept into the game because at some point quantity was more of a priority than quality. But you do learn an awful lot from the experience, some of which is applicable to starting a new project from the ground up and some of which is not.</p>
<p>New projects are inherently sexy and fun. It&#8217;s a chance to make all new kinds of mistakes instead (you hope!) of repeating old ones. But by the same token, I agree with Eric that there is a lot to be said for working on a live game&#8211;especially if it&#8217;s one you love and want to see get better. But as he notes, a new generation of developers can sometimes be overwhelmed by good intentions and leap to make changes before fully understanding the implications. Hopefully the transition between the &#8220;A&#8221; squad and the &#8220;B&#8221; team is gradual enough that an osmosis of wisdom can occur and leave the new caretakers with everything they need to do the job well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Myrix recently made an <a href="http://www.thewanderingrogue.com/2009/06/putting-the-game-before-the-mmo/" target="_blank">apt post</a>, the thesis of which was &#8220;<strong>put the game first, and don’t let the &#8216;MMO&#8217; get in the way.</strong>&#8221; He asserts that just making an MMO isn&#8217;t special anymore, and he&#8217;s right. While the genre has an inherent appeal, in today&#8217;s crowded market you need to concentrate on delivering a fun experience over just satisfying the particulars of a formula.</p>
<p>To put it another way: Don&#8217;t fall into the trap of designing a game by checklist. That is, you could come up with an entire list of criteria you believe to be required to satisfy your audience (persistence, loot, mounts, quests, combat, instances, etc. etc.) and check off every item, only to be left with a game that isn&#8217;t any fun. Players will forgive the absence of specific features; they won&#8217;t forgive broken features crammed together to make the back of the box look good if the result is an absence of fun.</p>
<p>It was a startling revelation from a Tabula Rasa developer that the game went into beta with the knowledge that it wasn&#8217;t fun yet. A game shouldn&#8217;t even go into production unless it&#8217;s fun, let alone make it into beta. Production is about having a solid core and being able to replicate it. If that core game isn&#8217;t fun, you&#8217;re just going to mass produce a bunch of un-fun content. Not a smart move, as history has proven.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake an MMO developer could make in today&#8217;s climate is to say &#8220;I must duplicate every one of WoW&#8217;s features in my game in order to be successful.&#8221; Blizzard is too far ahead of you to make that a realistic development goal; you&#8217;d inevitably end up cutting corners and falling short of the necessary polish and fun. Instead, decide early on what core elements make your game fun and focus your love and attention on those things. Use your core values as a razor to cut away excess and never lose your focus on the fun.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People occasionally wonder what kind of stuff I&#8217;m working on. This about sums it up:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The aim is to create a cathartic immersive interactive world with a <em>meta</em>, or <em>arch</em>, narrative facilitated through designed dramatic play.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What the hell does <em>that </em>mean? It comes from an article titled &#8220;<a title="As long as it has &quot;drama&quot; in there somewhere" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4061/dramatic_play.php" target="_blank">Dramatic Play</a>&#8221; by Stephen Dinehart, in which the author was kind enough to refer to several companies interested in expanding the definition of narrative gameplay, including the studio where I work. While it&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m not a fan of the academic study of game design, I found this a very interesting article. Because at the risk of sounding self-serving, I think the industry is on the brink of finally finding ways for games to truly become a medium for delivering a rich story experience.</p>
<p>Certain entrenched paradigms and assumptions need to be broken or discarded, because early generations of MMOGs proved that they don&#8217;t translate well to a fun gaming experience (example: HUGE BLOCKS OF TEXT DON&#8217;T WORK). But if we make this leap, games can grow as a legitimate art form and more consistently deliver the same emotional journey as movies, books, or plays&#8211;but in their own unique way.</p>
<p>There&#8230; I said it. I want to make <em>Art</em>. With a capital <em>A</em>. Yes, I <em>am </em>that pretentious.</p>
<p>However, I will take the quote above and rephrase it a little more plainly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The goal is to immerse players in a great story which they don&#8217;t just read, watch, or see acted out, but that they actually play through and impact in a meaningful way.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s really all there is to it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently interviewed for an <a title="Hamma time!" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/69328" target="_blank">article on IP creation</a> by Cody at Ten Ton Hammer. Along with several other developers, I discuss the fun and challenges of building an IP from the ground up as opposed to licensing an existing property.</p>
<p>This was one of the better interviews I&#8217;ve done, in part because I could talk freely about this subject without detailing anything about the game I&#8217;m working on. Though it&#8217;s not as clear when one game is the sole face of an intellectual property, IP development is distinct from game development. The goal is to build something that can live across a number of mediums and feel like it was crafted solely for whatever incarnation you&#8217;re experiencing.</p>
<p>When it works, you don&#8217;t notice it. When it doesn&#8217;t, you&#8217;re left with a movie that doesn&#8217;t feel like the game, a game that doesn&#8217;t feel like the movie, a movie that doesn&#8217;t feel like the book, and so on. Examples of the latter are much more common than examples of the former.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently bought the first season of Star Trek (The Original Series, of course) on Blu-Ray. It&#8217;s very cool, because you can switch between watching the episodes with the original special effects or the nicely redone versions they syndicated a couple years back. Unlike most revisions to classic shows, the updated effects took nothing away from the episodes and were handled very tastefully.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy a lot of series on DVD, but the original Trek is definitely worth the purchase. This spiffy set makes me wish another of my favorite science fiction shows would receive the same treatment: Babylon 5.</p>
<p>B5 is perhaps the best written show of its kind, groundbreaking in that it was plotted out as a complete story intended to run five seasons. Its themes and characters hold up exceptionally well, but its special effects look horribly dated. If it&#8217;s hard for me, a die-hard fan, to stomach the ancient Amiga-era CGI, it would no doubt be tough for a modern audience used to the glorious effects of Battlestar Galactica to get past them.</p>
<p>Releasing a remastered Blu-Ray and DVD of Babylon 5 with new CGI would allow the show to stand the test of time and catch on with a new audience. Is it likely to happen? Who knows. Though the show always struggled in the ratings, it has sold extremely well on DVD and prompted Warner Brothers to fund further TV movies and DVD projects (including a couple attempts at follow-up shows). In fact, Warners keeps flirting with the idea of a theatrical film, though it&#8217;s still uncertain as to whether it will happen. If B5 does make it to the big screen, reviving the franchise with a remastered DVD set would be a natural promotion for a movie.</p>
<p>So while I won&#8217;t hold my breath for B5 being revamped, I can look forward to seasons 2 and 3 (yes, even 3) of Trek to grace my LCD screen. And that&#8217;s not a bad thing at all.</p>

<p>Seriously, working with Bob is one of the best things about being at 38 Studios.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get emotional over Star Trek.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, our fuzzy old TV could catch about six stations: the three networks, PBS, a local independent, and maybe a UHF channel or two. Although the local station ran blocks of monster/horror movies on the weekends, there wasn&#8217;t much else on the airwaves for a skinny nerd to call his own.</p>
<p>The glorious exception was reruns of Trek&#8211;The Original Series, which at the time was The Only Series. I devoured those episodes, watching them again and again. I cried every time Captain Kirk had to let Edith die in order to save the timeline, and cheered every time he beat the Gorn. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and all the rest were a lifeline to me. No other fictional world before or since has had such a profound impact on my life, shaping my imagination and giving me an ideal to strive for.</p>
<p>When I was older I embraced the movies, TNG, DS9, and to a lesser extent the other shows. Though there was plenty of mediocre moments in those hundreds of hours of Trek, there were also some profoundly moving experiences. No matter how many times I&#8217;ve seen The Wrath of Khan, those scenes between Kirk and Spock leave me a blubbering mess. Shatner&#8217;s acting takes plenty of well-deserved knocks, but when he chokes on his words as he eulogizes Spock, I think it&#8217;s one of the most touching moments on film.</p>
<p>So when I heard plans to relaunch the franchise with a new cast taking on the classic roles of the original Trek, I was more than skeptical.</p>
<p>Happily, my fears were put to rest in the first five minutes of the film. It&#8217;s wonderful; go see it. It&#8217;s not just a great Trek film (possibly&#8230; <em>possibly</em>&#8230; the best of them all), it&#8217;s a great movie. I loved it.</p>
<p>If you need to hear more, there are some minor spoilers after the break.<span id="more-486"></span></p>
<p>So yeah, this is a relaunch of the franchise. Thankfully, it&#8217;s done in a way that honors continuity even as it renders it obsolete. (This is a good thing, by the way. The Trek franchise had way, way too much baggage to go forward the same way it had been. If they didn&#8217;t do a reboot like this, they would have needed to find another way to strip away excesses and focus on a new story.)</p>
<p>The scenes with Nimoy are spectacular. When he says <em>the line</em> to Kirk&#8230; you know the one&#8230; I nearly blubbered like a schoolboy.</p>
<p>The new cast is really good. Chris Pine nails all the important aspects of Kirk&#8217;s character without even coming close to parodying Shatner. Quinto is a great Spock, and made me forget all about Sylar. Karl Urban is perfect&#8211;PERFECT&#8211;as McCoy. And Simon Pegg is wonderful as Scotty, a role he completely makes his own.</p>
<p>I even liked the antagonist, Nero. He wasn&#8217;t some dastardly cosmic villain out to destroy the universe; he just wanted to inflict pain upon those he believed were responsible for his own.</p>
<p>Sure, it wasn&#8217;t a perfect film. You have to make a few leaps of plausibility similar to those needed in most action movies. But, importantly, you don&#8217;t have to turn a blind eye to blatant inconsistencies of character because there aren&#8217;t any. Our heroes act the way we want them to, and even though the timeline has been distorted they end up exactly where we want them to be.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t figured it out yet, I couldn&#8217;t be happier about this movie. Star Trek lives again, bringing with it the best of the original characters and all the adventure I fell in love with as a kid, updated for a new generation of moviegoers without compromising the important stuff. My hat&#8217;s off to J. J. Abrams for breathing new life into a franchise that had grown bloated and stale.</p>
<p>This cast is signed for two more films, and I can&#8217;t freaking wait to see them.</p>
