Because when killed, each of the five dragons drops a talisman that can be turned into a key to Sleeper's Tomb, home of Kerafyrm the Sleeper. As you know if you've been reading Mobhunter for very long, the awakening of The Sleeper was supposed to be a huge, game-changing event. The sole time it's been accomplished, however, nothing much <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-1455900310">happened</a>.<p>What was changed about Klandicar? Well, the main change is that he now has an area of effect spell that is <B>unresistable</B>:<p>Silver Breath<br>Decrease Hit Points (HP) by 400 (L1)<br>Cancel Magic + 9 levels<br>------------------------------------------------------------<br>Classes: None<br>------------------------------------------------------------<br>Skill: Evocation<br>Allowable Targets: Point Blank AoE<br>------------------------------------------------------------<br>Area Effect Range: 300 feet<br>------------------------------------------------------------<br>Resistance Check: None<p>That's right, folks. A 400-point, unresistable AoE that dispells one buff.<p>Handling the dispelling part is no big deal, if you think about it for a second and have the right equipment. But that 400 points of damage adds up darn quickly.<p>Why was this change made? Well, compared to the other dragons that drop First Brood talismans, Klandicar was a big weenie. Okay, Zlandicar isn't exactly the toughest kid on the block either, but at least that resident of Dragon Necropolis has a couple tricks up his sleeve. And compared to Sontalak, who has a massive fire-based AoE that stips your buffs faster than an exotic dancer strips her schoolgirl outfit, Klandicar was a joke.<p>But the question remains, why do it now, months after Velious has gone live?<p>One obvious theory is that Verant is concerned with the number of keys to Sleeper's Tomb that have entered the world. ST was supposed to be the be-all, end-all of EverQuest zones, and instead it's become a primal weapon farm for uberguilds. And with all those people swarming the tomb, The Sleeper is bound to be awakened again sooner or later.<p>Or, maybe Verant will say Klandicar's previous, steal-my-lunch-money state was an &quot;accident&quot;--an &quot;unintended bug.&quot;<p>In any case, the nerf stick just hit one out of the park, folks.
