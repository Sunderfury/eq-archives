It drains 300 mana from the party when it is cast, and takes 12 seconds to cast.<p>Succor now costs 100 mana to cast and only drains 150 mana from the party. This is changed from 300 mana casting cost, and a 750 mana drain on the party.<p>The goal of this change is to allow lower level groups to have a good escape option when adventuring into dungeons. It should also have the benefit of adding value to taking an evac caster in your group at earlier levels.</B><p>Not earth-shattering by any means, but definitely a handy addition to the low-end game, and a mana saver for the high-end. Perhaps the biggest direct benefit will be that your druid doesn't have to be upper 50s to get across Sirens Grotto anymore.<p><B><I><a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008111.html">Clerics</a></I><p>Now on Test Server - the Smite line of spells for Clerics has been changed to have faster casting times, but longer recasts. This allows the cleric to get spells off faster when they want to, but doesn't increase the power of the spells overall. <p>The total cast/recast time hasn't changed, I just moved the bulk of the time to the recast delay. Mostly, I see it as a convenience for clerics.<p>Strike was 1.5 cast, 2.5 delay - now 1.0 cast, 2.5 delay<br>Furor was 1.7 cast 2.5 delay - now 1.2 cast, 2.5 delay<br>Smite was 2.4 cast, 6.0 delay - now 1.4 cast, 7.0 delay<br>Wrath was 3.5 cast, 6.0 delay - now 2.0 cast, 7.5 delay<br>Retribution was 6.1 cast, 6.0 delay - now 3.1 cast, 9.0 delay<br>Reckoning was 7.0 cast, 6.0 delay - now 3.5 cast, 9.5 delay<br>Judgement was 7.5 cast, 6.0 delay - 4.0 cast, 9.5 delay<p>Now on Test Server - Clerics have had their Resurrect line of spells improved. The spells now start at a lower level, and are upgraded each spell circle. Here's the new list-<p>14th - 00% Rez (like Revive used to be)<br>19th - 10% Rez<br>24th - 20% Rez<br>29th - 35% Rez<br>34th - 50% Rez<br>39th - 60% Rez<br>44th - 75% Rez<br>49th - 90% Rez<br>56th - 96% Rez<p>The goal of this line is to make Resurrection available to Clerics earlier, and increase their value in groups at all levels. As a side benefit, this makes an exp. rez a lot more available to players of all levels.<p>The spell scrolls are available for sale in most major cities on Antonica, Faydwer, and Odus.</B><p>Those are two pretty big sets of changes for clerics. The smite changes will allow for less interruptions and should make battle clerics happy. The changes to resurrection spells are of obvious benefit to everyone.<p><B><I><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=14795.topic">Paladins</a></I><p>Now on Test Server - Paladins have had their Resurrect line of spells improved. The spells now start at a lower level, and are upgraded each spell circle. Here's the new list-<p>22nd - 00% Rez (like Revive used to be)<br>30th - 10% Rez<br>39th - 35% Rez<br>49th - 50% Rez<br>55th - 75% Rez<br>59th - 90% Rez<p>The goal of this line is to make Resurrection available to Paladins earlier, and increase their value in groups at all levels. As a side benefit, this makes an exp. rez a lot more available to players of all levels.</B><p>Of course, leave it to paladins to find a reason to whine about anything good that happens to anyone in the entire universe. Seriously, check out this genius response:<p><I>Well normally I would think this is fantstic. However I am 1 yellow bubble from 59 after logging last night. I have been working my tail off to get to the &quot;rez level&quot; I have dreamed about since I was brand new to EQ and my Paladin... Now just when I am about to reach that pinnacle of achievment. Every Paladin will be able to rez for xp and its no big deal.</I><p>You guys are lucky Csenicier is around, or I would simply ban paladin news from ever appearing on this site again.<p><B><I><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=13919.topic">Wizards</a></I><p>Now on Test Server - Wizard's have had a new Evacuate spell added, and the existing one has been lowered in mana cost.<p>Lesser Evacuate costs 150 mana and is available at level 12. It drains 300 mana from the party when it is cast, and takes 12 seconds to cast.<p>Evacuate now costs 100 mana to cast and only drains 150 mana from the party. This is changed from 300 mana casting cost, and a 750 mana drain on the party.<p>The goal of this change is to allow lower level groups to have a good escape option when adventuring into dungeons. It should also have the benefit of adding value to taking an evac caster in your group at earlier levels.</B><p>At least wizards know how to be grateful, having met these changes with general approval. Again, this is not going to uberfy the class really, but adds some versatility and mana conservation.<p><B><I><a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1331">Necromancers</a></I></B><p>There were changes for necros as well, though not announced by Rich himself (they don't use EZboard, which might be the issue):<p><B>Some Necromancer spell changes have made it onto the Test Server:<p>Demi Lich has been lowered to a Level 56 spell from Level 60. <p>Arch Lich has been improved to a 35 Mana for 53 Hitpoint conversion. The previous ratio was 20 mana for 31 hitpoints. <p>Quivering Veil of Xarn has been altered. It no longer has a damage shield component and now heals 150 hitpoints instantly instead of over 4 ticks... <p>Skin of the Shadow<br>Invisibility<br>Increase Magnification by 115% (L55)<br>Ultravision<p>.. Nighttime has been removed</B><p>Necros are happy. Yes, once again, <I>necros are happy,</I> and they deserve to be. The systematic disempowerment of the necromancer class was like pulling a mouthful of teeth just to get rid of one cavity, and it's about time some of their power and overall effectiveness was restored.<p>But what is the cumulative effect of these changes on the game? Obviously, lower-level casters are gaining power... is this a good thing overall? If the net effect of all this is to get players to the high-end game faster, then what becomes of the high-end game?<p>Is the ramping-up of high-end encounters through Ring of Fire tactics Verant's way of preparing themselves for the oncoming onslaught of wannabe uber players? Are ultra-tough zone revamps a la Cazic-Thule going to be the norm? When there are no more low-end players, will every zone just be cranked up to 11 on the difficulty scale as a relatively easy alternative to adding truly new content?<p>Don't get all in a tizzy now; I don't think most of those questions are truly showing what Verant intends (it's called <I>playing devil's advocate,</I> people). But when you see a huge melee upgrade a few months ago followed by the upcoming caster changes, you have to start to wonder how much is too much. Ask any old-time MUD player and they'll tell you: nothing kills the fun of a game faster than making everything spiral up, up, up. That's MUDflation--and right now, that's the biggest potential danger for EverQuest. It's up to us to keep vigilant and make sure our game stays healthy.
