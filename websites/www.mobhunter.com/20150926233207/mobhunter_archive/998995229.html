The estimated downtime is 4 hours.</B><p>We've barely recovered from the last round of patch madness. Yikes!<p>There's also something about their <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000604.html">player feedback system</a> not working--let the conspiracy theories commence.<p><BIG>Casters Upgraded--Just Not the Ones You Wanted</BIG><p>Absor posted one of my favorite threads in a while last week when he <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000601.html">talked about</a> the newfound smarts that caster NPCs received in the latest patch. Mobs now cast spells that are more in line with their class and level, rather than the same old level 20 magic they've been using all along. First Absor explained the change:<p><B>I just wanted to pop in and let you all know that the intent of these changes is to make things a little more... (I would normally use the word &quot;realistic&quot; here, but that usually causes me trouble...) internally consistent. Basically, the tuning stopped when the NPCs were picking spells that were similar to those that PCs pick.<p>But the spell selections aren't the only things we're changing.<p>For example, and I didn't even know this happened, Enchanter NPCs used to get an automatic chance to hit with their spells, regardless of the resistances of their target. We took that ability away from them. Now if they want to have a better chance to land spells they are going to have to cast a Tash spell.<p>The goal here is to make things fairer when it comes to NPC spell casters, and it applies to both sides.</B><p>Not all players were happy, of course, particularly since they perceived NPCs to have too many advantages over players in terms of mana pool, hitpoints, and the ability to cast spells higher than their actual level. Alan had a response for that, too:<p><B>Actually, that's a 'sort-of-a-bug' thing... Because NPCs were so stupid about casting spells before, some of them were given improved spell casting abilities to make them relatively better casters. Some of those casters might be too good now, and the team will be looking at those on a case-by-case basis.<p>Keep in mind, though, that NPCs can be weak or strong for their 'level', and special NPCs can certainly be tougher or weaker than their /con might indicate. Having some of them cast higher level spells is just another tool, just like giving them procs or breath weapons or other innate abilities.<p>We're not forgetting any of those things: we know NPCs have relatively more hit points than PCs, we know they do more damage... we know that stuff.<p>You have to keep in mind that these NPCs, though smarter, still don't have the advantages of being played by human beings. The players get to pick the odds for the most part, they get to pick the timing of the fight and they get to choose from a wide arsenal of classes, spells, items, abilities etc. And a human can put all that stuff together in ways that even our AI code can't (though I'd love to see NPCs splitting PC spawns. :) ).</B><p>If you're looking at me to champion the cause of reverting NPC casters back to the way they were, you're barking up the wrong tree. I'm 100% in favor of Verant making the game more challenging <I>in ways that actually make sense.</I> Yes, that's the kicker here, kiddies--this change makes sense. Giving mobs a deathtouch ability or twice as many hitpoints or a DOT that wipes out whole raid parties in 30 seconds are cheap ways of making encounters harder--making mobs <I>smarter</I> is not.<p>If you've read much of my editorializing, you know that I'm very much concerned with content becoming trivialized in the face of increased player power. This is not to say I want weak classes--far from it. Players should be powerful, and balanced, and happy... it's just that mobs need to remain challenging. NPCs, due to their artificial nature, need to have certain advantages in combat that players must make great strides to overcome. Having a player log in one day and suddenly find they can cast twice as many spells or swing a sword twice as hard are not good ways to repair balance in the game, especially when there is no corresponding increase in the power of the mobs.<p>This change, while not affecting all NPCs, adds a twist to the game that is--though I shudder to use the word in the context of a game about dragons and magic swords--realistic. Now, how about monk/SK/necro mobs that feign death during the fight? How about mobs that disarm your weapons? Mobs that carry pumice to dispell your damage shield when you fight them?<p>Well, maybe not in this game, but you can bet we'll see smarter and smarter mobs in the coming generations of MMORPGs. And though you may not believe it right this second, I can guarantee you that's a good thing.<p><BIG>I'll Take 3 Vulaks, Hold the Pickles</BIG><p>At first it seemed like the return of an old friend. A <a href="http://pub41.ezboard.com/fvazaellecommunitycenterfrm1.showMessage?topicID=2705.topic">story</a> showed up on a Vazaelle message board about a guild called Promethian Order who had confronted and killed the long-lost Vulak--former boss of the Temple of Veeshan who went away after Verant decided his loot was too good or something (he's now part of a ring event that doesn't work). Promethian posted screenshots of a dead dragon and got lots of grats on the assumed-to-be-uber loot.<p>Well, at least until Rich Waters came by and busted them:<p><B>I wanted to stop by and thank Promethian Order for helping our Marketing Department film a promotional video, and taking a couple hours out of their night to be part of it. We definitely appreciated you guys taking time out of your raid schedule to help us with this when you could have been out doing other things in game.<p>We wanted to get footage of a raid fighting with dragons, and Promethian Order was kind enough to spend a couple hours doing battle with various small drakes and drake hatchlings that GMs changed to appear as dragon models. We got some great footage as Promethian Order fought 25 or more of these &quot;simulated dragons&quot; for us in about an hour.<p>Promethian Order didn't encounter Vulak, but I think a lot of people had a good time and hopefully they'll post some other screenshots of the event on their website. <p>Thanks again for the help,<p>Rich Waters<br>Lead Designer, EverQuest</B><p>Finally the PO folks posted the <a href="http://www.promethianorder.com/">truth</a> on their Web site. As Waters indicated, the guild was asked to help shoot a promotional video, so the GMs despawned ToV and took PO inside the area normally occupied by the triplets to get some exciting footage. After a tantalizing peek at Vulak (who was then despawned), the GMs threw in wave after wave of low-level mobs in the shape of various drakes and dragons, all for the sake of capturing a thrilling (if unrealistic) fight scene. The culmination, of course, was an epic battle with a giant bunny.<p>After it was all over, the GMs offered to spawn a couple real ToV dragons for the guild as a reward--except they couldn't pick Vulak. What a bummer.<p>Then again, the Big V has reportedly making some <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11281.topic">other appearances</a> lately, including a <a href="http://www.landslide-guild.com/">bugged spawn</a> of the entire ring at one time.<p>Isn't it time yet to bring the real Vulak back, if only for a little while?<p><BIG>Letters... We Get Letters</BIG><p>A couple of our readers sent in some tidbits that we wanted to pass on. Kitzu reports:<p><B>Nurga changed over the series of the latest patches.  The slaves in the pits are gone. The spiders are gone.  The goblins in Nurga are slightly more powerful than before (one step up in goblin power -- they're not slavedrivers, boneseers, dirttracers, stonechanters, stalagknights, blightcallers, firedrowsers, etc. instead of whipcrackers, mosstroopers, etc.).  The goblin warder is now also popping in there (saw three Shrouds of Nature in four hours of faction farming).</B><p>The sleeping ogre for the monk quest is still in place, thankfully.<p>Over on Test server, Geeddas tells us that, for now at least, Jaggedpine Forest is available to all Test players, not just Legends subscribers. Though we presume the plan is still to make the zone live on Stormhammer first, at least Test players will get a chance to take a look. Here is Geeddas' first glimpse:<p><B>This zone is very interesting and the NPCs in the area you zone into talk about the History and kept me busy for about 40 mins. The first mobs I found con'd blue to my level 39 druid and was only about 20 feet from the zone in. After talking to a few NPCs around one mentioned a banker but I was unable to find him before a power outage stopped my exploration. It also appears that Verant left an area open for the Unkempt Woods to be placed, However the zone was not there when I went exploring.</B><p>Take a peek--Test server can always use more, well, testers.<p>As always, Mobhunter welcomes news from our readers. Just <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">drop me a line</a> if you find something interesting. The worst I'll do is make fun of you for days.<p>Thanks for the tips!<p><BIG>You Have to Listen to Everything I Say, All the Time</BIG><p>Over at the Safehouse, a player in desperate need of a <a href="http://www.roz.org/flash/bear.swf">hug</a> posted a sort of <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=24037.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25">essay</a> on what he believes to be wrong with the way Verant interacts with customers, citing the closing of the whineplay forums and a perceived shift in Absor's focus as evidence that VI and SOE don't care what customers think about the game. The piece was ostensibly directed towards Brad McQuaid's new Sigil venture as a warning of what not to do.<p>The thread later picked up momentum as the Verant nay-sayers chimed in with ideas about what the company should be doing for them, including such notions as a council of players to feed ideas to VI. Eventually even <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=24037.topic&amp;start=38&amp;stop=38">Brad responded</a> with a long, detailed post that defended a lot of Verant's decisions when he was there and tried to shed some light on why things were done a certain way (read the post--it's very good). Even the former <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=24037.topic&amp;start=65&amp;stop=66">Lady Daegarmo posted</a> a response assuring that the customer service staff at his former employer really, really does care. I especially liked this part:<p><B>The people that are your GMs are people who do this because they love it, not for the money (or lack of it) that they are paid, or what little &quot;perceived power&quot; they may receive from doing it.<p>I think that Mythic, Sony, and OSI have all done outstanding jobs in creating the trailblazers for this incredibly new and difficult position called &quot;Game Master&quot;.<p>I also think that the players have been, for the most part, very exceptional in their patience while the industry as a whole finds its footing on this new ground that we stand. Customer Service in every game, will become better in time, just as the games themselves will.<p>In the next games you will find yourself saying &quot;WOW! This GM helped me when in my last game didn't!&quot;, just as much as you say &quot;WOW! These graphics look awesome and I didnt fall under the world!</B><p>I honestly don't understand why some people seem to want to hate Verant/Mythic/OSI so badly, or want to believe they are out to screw us over. All of these companies--and Sigil, too--want to earn your business and your loyalty. Honest to god, they want you to enjoy the game. Why is that so hard for some people to accept? Must there always be an evil conspiracy at the heart of every change made to the game? Is it really so impossible to comprehend that these companies are, by and large, made up of people who care and genuinely enjoy this genre?<p>As for the notion of Verant et al closing the doors of communication... far from it. You can e-mail Absor anytime you want. You can submit feedback and bug reports in game. You can post on any of a dozen sites/message boards that Absor and co. actually read (like, say, this one). Hell, you can even go to a FanFaire and bug developers in person. The notion that VI doesn't get player feedback--even without the official boards--is ludicrous.<p>Really, though, Verant shouldn't try to please everyone. If developers start catering to the whim of every customer, they'll be the next <a href="http://www.frinky.com/cgi-bin/miva?/miva/information/episodeguide.mv+ep_number=7F16">Powell Motors</a>. The big picture must always win out, even if some players can't see beyond their personal desires.<p>Oh, what the hell am I babbling for? Just call me a VAK and be done with it.
