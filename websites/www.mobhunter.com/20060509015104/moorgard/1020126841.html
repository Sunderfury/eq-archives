There aren't many guilds currently messing with the Zek family, though of course that number will inevitably rise.<p>Of greater interest to many is the improvement to the Plane of Storms. You probably haven't spent a lot of time in this zone, even if you were flagged for it, because the mobs hit hard and the exp sucked. Well, after this change, the mobs still hit hard (maybe they eased up just a bit) but the exp is pretty nice. The biggest downside to the zone, however, still remains: while there are lots of giants to kill, it takes a fair amount of time to split them into managable numbers, thus making downtime between kills unacceptable. Compared to the Plane of Valor, where you can have your puller literally lining up targets for your crowd control department to park, Storms still won't give you the exp you crave. So although this is a good change and the zone population will increase, I expect the vast majority of the place will continue to go unused most of the time.<p>By the way, the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/scheduled_downtime.jsp">next patch</a> was announced:<p><B>On Tuesday, November 19th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 4 hours. The EverQuest Operations Team</b><p>No official word yet on what's going to be included, though we hope the bug with slows will be the top priority. Either that, or the Dev Team can simply give up trying to fix slow and give shamans Complete Heal, port spells, and 18/20 fists as weapons.<p><BIG>Devs Talk Too Much</big><p>Casters Realm has posted their <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4899">transcript</a> of the Dev chat from last weekend's FanFaire in San Francisco. A couple highlights of interest include:<p><B><I>Any chance of having buff timers to tell how long spells have been on players?</i><p>That's something we've been debating about how much we want players to see. Right now I don't think there's too many people against that, so it might go in at some point in the future.<p><I>Can /who all guild ever show more than 20 people?</i> <p>That's a good suggestion, and it's something we should look into. The system that handles those requests used to be a lot busier than it is. It's not a promise, but we'll look at it. <p><I>There are 15 buff slots on players. With many of the new buffs and temporary buffs it's just not enough. Can we increase the number of buffs somehow?</i><p>At some point we will be addressing this. It probably won't be through additional buffs, but more likely through allowing a number of extra slots just for temporary buffs such bard songs, short duration heals, etc.<p>Editors Note: As of tomorrow's patch (11/14/02) to the Test Server, people who do a /WHO ALL on their own guild will see a full list of all members.]<p><I>Are there Epic 2's? </i><p>There may be Epic 2.0's in the future,. There may be items in the game that are really good and are quest based and look special, but there is nothing in game right now which would qualify specifically from a design point as being an Epic 2.0.</b><p>Frankly I'm completely bored with the whole &quot;upgrade our epics&quot; thing that some people seem to have such a crusade about. If Verant does put new class-specific weapon quests in the game that would actually appeal to the current crop of high-end players, those epics would require a full raid force to do them anyway. Remember that just because existing epics are (mostly) easy now doesn't mean this was always the case--it used to be that only powerful guilds had a shot at completing most of them. So Verant is really in a lose-lose position with new epic quests, because either the risk/reward will be out of whack or they will take criticism that the weapons will be too hard to obtain.<p>Just go to the Bazaar and buy one of those <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=34436.topic">overpowered weapons</a> from Halls of Honor, already.<p><BIG>From the PR Department</big><p>In case you were wondering how PoP was selling, SOE sent out a press release with the following info:<p><B>EverQuest The Planes Of Power, the latest expansion pack for the online gaming phenomenon EverQuest&reg;, has surpassed the 200,000 unit sales mark in less than three weeks.  The numbers reinforce EverQuest's popularity and brand dominance in online gaming.  EverQuest currently has more than 430,000 active subscribers and regularly experiences sessions involving more than 100,000 simultaneous players.</b><p>That's a pretty impressive number, meaning about half of the registered users bought the expansion. I would have thought it would be more, but it may be that since this was billed from the start as an expansion for high-level players, more casual subscribers weren't as likely to buy it right away. Assuming the next expansion goes back to the &quot;levels 1-65&quot; model of Kunark and Luclin, I'm sure it will do even better. Especially if they introduce a new playable race of flying monkeys.<p>I'd certainly play a flying monkey. I just wonder what <a href="http://pub142.ezboard.com/fbrellrantsfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1315.topic">name</a> they'd give it.<p>Anyway, I hope SOE made enough money from selling PoP that they can <B>get rid of the freaking pop-up adds on the EQ Live site.</b> When the Dev Corner board moved to the front page of the Live site, pop-ups went away--but now the evil devils are back. That gets a big thumbs down from us.<p><B>No more pop-ups!</b>
