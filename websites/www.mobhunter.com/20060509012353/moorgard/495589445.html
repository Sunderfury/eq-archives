<html><head><title>State of the Luclin Nation</title></head><body><h1>State of the Luclin Nation</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-12-20</p>Absor has been quiet lately, I guess, because he was writing up <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000438.html">this monster post</a> about what's going on with Luclin these days. In case you hadn't noticed, there are still a lot of broken/unfinished parts of this expansion (that's about the most generous way I can put it).<p>The patch that will be finished by the time most of you read this story (early Thursday morning) is supposed to contain a significant number of fixes, and will no doubt contain some content tweaks as well. Absor addressed an issue that some customers are raising on the subject of content changes:<p><B>Some people ask why it is that our patch messages include a lot of content changes, and suggest that our time would be better spent fixing bugs than changing or adding content at this point.<p>It is important to understand that the people working on content are not the same people that work on programming. We are not taking any of our resources away from fixing programming bugs to work on content.</b><p>Okay, fair enough. Companies generally don't work by throwing 100% of their resources at one or two issues; rather, they plan their work and balance their resources across several fronts at once.<p>Alan went on to discuss the short-term goals for the Luclin team:<p><B>Stuff in the works, some of these will be fixed with the next patch (in no particular order, most are priority one for the person working on them): <p>- Reducing loading and zoning times<br>- Crashes occurring for some people when logging in<br>- Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing that character<br>- Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound configurations.<br>- Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or duplicated<br>- Characters changing to wolf form look tiny<br>- Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects<br>- Faces that sometimes don't remain as selected<br>- New Bard Area of Effect songs are acting strangely <br>- New Necromancer group debuff spells are not working properly<br>- There is a very short pause for some players when other players enter a zone<br>- A few players are being disconnected at random<br>- Slow framerate on some fast computers</b><p>That last bit refers to the fact that Umbra--the technology that only puts textures on visible surfaces and therefore is supposed to make frame rates nice and zippy--seems to be broken on AMD processors at the moment. For people like me, that's a pretty major bug.<p>Just so we all don't forget it, Absor also detailed the stuff that the Verant team has accomplished since release in terms of getting the game into playable condition:<p><B>Fixed since release (in no particular order either): <p>- Bard songs and group buffs (these were related problems)<br>- Familiars no longer get added to hate lists and don't cause you to crash if you die<br>- Wolf form factions with the new models are now in line with intent<br>- Several face/hair issues, such as not being allowed to choose bald and some facial hair.<br>- /follow bug that caused folks to crash<br>- Transparency issues with i810 display adapters<br>- Crash bug related to root and gate<br>- Various item and content fixes<br>- Crash problems in certain zones<br>- K6 Processors: We're working to fix, or provide a work-around for problems AMD K6 users are experiencing when entering some zones. Shadowhaven is one of those zones.<br>- A bug that was giving classes that had the old experience penalties more alternate advancement experience than they should have been getting.<br>- Some people are seeing Vah Shir as male humans<br>- Working on getting facial hair tinting for the half-elves, dark elves, high elves, and dwarf females working<br>- Some players are crashing in Hollowshade Moor<br>- A few people that don't have Shadows of Luclin installed are seeing &quot;Entering Luclin&quot; when logging in and then crashing<br>- A bug exists that causes random crashes when exiting game to server select, and then going back into game. <br>- Large fonts and text that extends outside their boxes is affecting a few users</b><p>That's a pretty comprehensive list, and those fixes certainly are good things, but we'd like to point out a few items that aren't on the &quot;to do&quot; board just yet:<p>1. Velious armors--put them in game, please. More than just helms this time.<br>2. Armor tinting--allowing skin to remain its natural color while wearing tinted armor. This was on the priority list not so long ago, but like a bad video on TRL it seems to have faded away quiety.<br>3. Finish sitting animations for all races and sexes.<br>4. Add in the ground detail and the setting to control its clipping plane.<p>There's probably more, but I'm sleepy. So instead of coming up with something that would seem <a href="http://www.coincidencedesign.com/">forced</a>, we'll save the rest of our comments until after the patch tomorrow. Feel free to add your observations below.
