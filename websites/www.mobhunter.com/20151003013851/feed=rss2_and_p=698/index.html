		<description><![CDATA[I have followed this studio since you left SoE. 
My interest beams excitement once Reckonng came out. For the first time in many years I found a game that I played all of the way through. I would have done so  more quickly, but I took time to revel on the story. I now lusted after the MMO. I wonder if te art you created is like that of Van Gogh; apprecaited only after deah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve, thanks for taking us along for the ride the last 6 years.  Although I certainly hope that one day we find that MMORPG that delivers upon our expectations, there&#039;s no harm in recognizing the value of hope, and what your project brought to the community the last several years.  Seeing how carefully crafted and well presented the lore at Amalur.com was, I am certain the project would have been immensely enjoyable for all of us to take in.  Thank you for letting us ride along while we could.  

In no way would I ever intentionally minimize the emotional impact upon those who are invested in the creation of Amalur or who have seen their livelihoods put at risk in the last few days, but the last few days have been incredibly gut wrenching for your fans.  I am heartbroken for you and the team, not only because we won&#039;t get to share in the game, but because the team&#039;s enthusiasm and passion was so evident in every aspect of the game and every comment that you were able to share with the public.  

Our market seems to be changing, and the niche growing smaller by the year.  But I hope one day that we&#039;ll have an opportunity to share another, much happier, launch day.  

Thanks for your continuing contributions to the community.  I&#039;m wishing nothing but the best for you and the team as they relocate and set up shop on another adventure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good luck in your future.  I know joining 38 Studios was a big decision on your part, involving a move from one coast to another and years of devotion.  And, you weren&#039;t alone in this.

Please do keep us apprised of your transition from one dream to another.  While we may not see the results of your work here, we remember the work you did with EQ2 and hope to see more of it in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Terrible, sad, heart-breaking news. I am so sorry to hear this.

But still, better to have dreamed big and failed than to never have dreamed at all.

Hang in there and take care. Good things will come your way again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The gang over at 38Watch and I are all stunned and heartbroken over all of this.  But you should know that we have always had enormous respect for you and believe you when you say that the world you created was something to see.  It&#039;s just tragic  that after all this time,  we won&#039;t get to see it.

Best wishes from all of us. 

I wish you well on your next adventure.]]></description>
