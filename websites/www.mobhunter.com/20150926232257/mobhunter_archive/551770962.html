The bad news is that Verant gave us a shiny new patch program today.<p>Well, mistakes happen. Seems the new patcher--featuring fancy Luclin artwork--caused a couple different problems today. Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000400.html">posted</a> a fix for those people who had been testing DirectX 8:<p><B>** For those having problems logging in **<p>If you are having a problem that causes you to be kicked out of the game after selecting &quot;Play on line&quot;, there is a solution to this problem.<p>Delete the file &quot;bmpwad6.s3d&quot; from your EverQuest directory.<p>This should solve the problem.<p>However, if you find that you are still having the problem and you have previously edited your eqclient.ini file in order to test out the DX8 DLL, then you should be able to fix the problem by:<p>Edit the line in your EQClient.ini in your EQ directory from &quot;GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx8.DLL&quot; to &quot;GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx7.DLL&quot;.<p>We apologize for any trouble this may have caused some of our customers. <p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>It seems, however, that there were other problems afoot. Later in the day, Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000399.html">responded</a> to some customer concerns about the patch program:<p><B><I>This does not appear to be working for me. I have patched from the current everquest.exe program and the testeverquest.exe, both in standard and test server mode, multiple times and I have not received a new everquest.exe. I even tried a &quot;Thorough File Scan&quot; without success.</I><p>That's one of the things we're fixing.<p>Menolen wrote:<p><I>An update on my previous message. I waited till I came into work this morning to do the patch. 20 minutes to patch. (Very high speed conenction) . It is replacing every single zone file. Is there a file I can send to show you what was patched?</I><p>This is another of the things we're fixing. It seems that the patcher was sending a bunch of files that you didn't need to patch.</B><p>The latter problem seems to be what was keeping most of the people I know tied up. By the time I logged on this evening (I had to clean Kohath and Csenicier's cages, then give them fresh water), things seemed to be pretty much under control. The new patcher locked up once, but after that it got me connected. It did seem to take much longer to connect, but since I'm on a cable modem it wasn't so bad.<p>Folks, Luclin is a major revamp of the game, and we have to expect some hiccups. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather have some problems this week in order to ensure next week goes more smoothly. Hey, I'm taking time off work to play, so I don't want my Luclin time interrupted.<p>Verant acted quickly to fix things today, which bodes well for Luclin's launch. But we're keeping our fingers crossed, just in case.
