But on days like this, it's tempting--believe me. Sitting around the Mobhunter offices shooting spitballs at Kohath and Csenicier only holds one's attention for so long.<p>If you are moving to or from the European server known as Antonius Bayle, I guess you'd be interested to know what Absor has to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000391.html">say</a> about it:<p><B>We plan to make the final moves during the next patch. We don't have a time set for the next patch yet, however.</B><p>Absor must be feeling the news crunch too, because he posted the above snippet not once, but <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000378.html">twice</a>. Hate to break it to you, Alan, but server info simply ain't that interesting.<p>Speaking of uninteresting, Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000390.html">posted</a> that Scars of Velious is available for purchase again:<p><B>I've had several people ask me about Scars of Velious. For a short time they were out of stock. Well, it's back in stock in new mini-box format. Here is a link for those of you that want to pick up a copy for yourselves or perhaps as a gift to go along with that copy of Shadows of Luclin that I know you're itching to get your hands on.</B><p>I guess sometimes we forget that not <I>everyone</I> has bought Velious yet. We rabid Norrathians who will be outside Electronics Boutique waiting for the doors to open sometimes forget that every player does not necessarily buy an expansion right away.<p>To those tortured few, we ask simply... WTF???<p>The most interesting news out of Verant comes from the mad wizard Al'Kabor, who posted yet another <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/al_kabor_07.jsp">journal entry</a> concerning his efforts to learn more about the Combine Empire. Looks like the little bugger has finally found his way to Luclin:<p><B>The portal opened once again and I stepped through it.<p>My passage through the portal has just been completed and it has closed behind me. I find myself in the center of a quadrolith with surroundings not like any that I have seen before. I will continue to write in this journal, but for now I must explore this strange region.</B><p>It's kind of sad that the hottest info from Verant comes via the pen of a fictional character, but we'll take news wherever we can get it.<p>Around the Net, we're happy to report that <a href="http://eqlizer.net/index.shtml">EQ'Lizer</a> is up and running again, though <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/">Voodoo Extreme</a> seems to be missing in action. No idea what's going on with them.<p>Okay, so what's with the lack of interesting news? Why has Absor been so quiet? Why hasn't Abashi showed up to browbeat some poor player into submission?<p>Well, it's pretty obvious, I suppose. Luclin is <B>TWO WEEKS AWAY.</b> Every Verant resource is putting the final touches on the Luclin launch. And rightly so.<p>However, the unfortunate side effect upon sites like Mobhunter is that we'll be a little more boring than usual. We'll do our best to keep things <a href="http://www.hostile.org/poetry/limerick2.html">interesting</a> for you.<p>Okay, so that won't cut it. We'll do better next time.
