If you can make them move or they warp around, that's a bug.<br>- Targetting/Looting and: Eyes of Zomm, Familiars, Corpses, Warders.<br>- A few hundred new strings added to the localization string table.<p>* Familiars should be able to zone from qcat to qeynos2 with their master.<p>* NPCs who shout names while they DT should be fixed.<p>* Skiffs should be working.<p>* Tinkered compass should truly grant a sense heading boost.<p>* Random frame lag in guktop, oasis. Believe it or not, it was related to alligators. (I know -- I had to have it explained to me, too.)<p>* Rogue hotbutton lockups due to pickpocket/beg should no longer be possible. The client didn't realize that these two have always used the same skill timer.<p>* AA turn summoned should work as described.<p>* Mage AA reclaim should work with epic pet.<p>* HP on food items should be taken into account. Be careful how you eat <br>- You can kill yourself if you run out of bonus food at an inopportune moment!<p>* Potions should work on horses.<p>* PC spell filters reworked - Problems with of taking damage without being able to see it, or the client over-reporting damage taken should be fixed.<p>* Re-enabled focus items and AAs for clickable items that affect a spell's duration.<p>* Dealt with some DS stacking issues.<p>* Updated all non-pet NPCs to return items they don't care about. Charmed NPCs will still accept items while they are charmed. (Naturally, the Rivervale and GFay Priests of Discord are exempt from this rule. ;)<p>* Fixed a bug in mage QuickSummon AA that was preventing it from affecting Call of the Hero and Manifest Elements.<p>* High level NPCs in Cazic Thule should now be tauntable.<p>* Res boxes being automatically dismissed by other windows.<p>* /yell and lifetap string problems.<p>- The EverQuest Development Team</B><p>As always, these changes may or may not make it to the live servers. Given how most of these items are relatively straightforward bug fixes, however, the odds are pretty good we'll be seeing them soon. In fact...<p><BIG>The Thrill is Gone</BIG><p>In case your server isn't coming down <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1724090244">this week</a>, here's a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000531.html">list</a> of the ones that are napping next week:<p><B>The following is the list of all scheduled maintenance for the week of April 8th:<p>On Monday, April 8th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), the Zebuxoruk and Tallon Zek servers will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. The estimated downtime is 8 hours.<p>On Tuesday, April 9th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 4 hours. The Servers Solusek Ro and Fennin Ro will be down an additional 4 hours coming out of the patch window for scheduled maintenance.<p>On Wednesday, April 10th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), the Povar and Firiona Vie servers will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. The estimated downtime is 8 hours.<p>On Thursday, April 11th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), the Innoruuk and Xev servers will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. The estimated downtime is 8 hours.<p>On Friday, April 12th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), the Tarew Marr and Ayonae Ro servers will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. The estimated downtime is 8 hours.<p>- The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>In other words, many servers are getting <I>at least</I> two patches next week. Including the emergency patch that's sure to follow, we're looking at three patches per server.<p>Patch days are poopy. Waiting for mobs to pop is no fun, and it's really a pain if you end up having to wait several more days than you anticipated because of multiple patches.<p><BIG>Compounding Tragedies</BIG><p>By now, many of you have heard about the EverQuest player from Wisconsin who <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/mar02/31536.asp">took his own life</a> last Thanksgiving. The player, Shawn Woolley, &quot;sacrificed everything so he could play for hours, ignoring his family, quitting his job and losing himself in a 3-D virtual world.&quot; His mother, who has been trying to use her son's EQ-related scribblings to find out what caused Shawn to commit suicide, has hired an attorney and intends to sue Sony Online Entertainment. SOE won't give her the answers she's looking for due to its privacy policy--though I haven't seen a clear list of exactly what questions she is asking.<p>A person's death is nothing to make light of, and it's perfectly understandable for a mother to need to find answers about what happened to her son. But given the facts of the case, one has to wonder whether Mrs. Woolley's efforts are focused in the right direction:<p><B>Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried to get him help by contacting a mental health program and trying to get him to live in a group home. A psychologist diagnosed him with depression and schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which include a lack of desire for social relationships, little or no sex drive and a limited range of emotions in social settings.</B><p>Scott was also epileptic, and his 12-hour EQ binges were the cause of seizures on multiple occassions.<p>Clearly, this was an individual with physical and emotional problems that were major factors in his suicide. He was very much at risk to become addicted to something, and EverQuest just happened to be the drug of choice. However, unlike heroin or nicotine, there is nothing inherently addictive about EverQuest--er, physically, I mean. Unfortunately, I don't think a lawsuit is going to get Scott's mother the closure she needs.<p>So how far is each of us away from being another Scott Woolley? That's not a comfortable question to ask. Without a doubt, every person reading this site has an emotional attachment to EverQuest. If you didn't, you wouldn't waste your time reading my ramblings. You care about the game. I do, too. We spend a lot of time playing it. Are we addicts?<p>Sometimes, when my butt aches from a marathon session in ToV, or when I stay up far too late on a work night trying to finish a Mobhunter article, I begin to wonder. But I figure that as long as I keep asking the question, I'm probably okay. Plus, there's always my basket weaving hobby to fall back on.<p>If you want to go on an uninformed rant about Mrs. Woolley being a bad parent, you can go <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/04/02/1558246.shtml?tid=127">elsewhere</a>. I really don't think we know enough facts to make a judgement about that. The lawsuit seems more than a bit dubious to me, though. I hope Mrs. Woolley finds what she needs, but somehow I don't think EverQuest will provide the answers... just like it didn't provide what her son needed most.<p>EverQuest--like alchohol, narcotics, television, gambling, shopping, working out, eating, eBay, sex, or any hobby--can become an obsession that takes over your life. But in most cases, that has more to do with the personality of the person than the object of his or her desire.<p><BIG>Another Year, Another Video Card</BIG><p>Despite Kohath and Csenicier's practical advice to the contrary, I ended up buying a GeForce 4 Ti4400 over the weekend (blame the $50 Best Buy gift card that burned a hole in my pocket, plus a 10% discount--I couldn't turn down a $219 video card).<p>The only problem I ran into--you just knew that was coming, didn't you--is that EverQuest stopped working after I installed the card, despite downloading new drivers and reinstalling DirectX 8.1. I make it past the server select screen, and just before I get to the character select (I can hear the whooshing of my punches), I drop to the desktop. No error message or anything; EQ just dies.<p>Fortunately, I had a spare hard drive laying around and threw Windows XP Pro on it, and EverQuest works like a charm on that setup.  I haven't tested the card fully, or tried optimizing my settings much, but I'm very pleased with the preliminary results. I cranked everything up to max (all models, clipping plane, detail level, etc.) and it is noticably faster than an original GeForce 3.<p>Of course, as Kohath and Csenicier pointed out over lunch, there is the even faster GeForce 4 Ti4600 for $100 more... but I couldn't justify that expense. An obsessive paladin from my guild plunked down the money for one, and the difference between it and his old GeForce 2 is like night and day (he didn't have any of the Win98SE upgrade woes that I did, so I'm not sure what my problem is). So depending on your current setup, an upgrade may or may not make sense for you.<p>Unless, of course, you're an obsessive freak. But then, aren't we all, at least a little bit?
