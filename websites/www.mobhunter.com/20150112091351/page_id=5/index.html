				<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Moorgard is the pseudonym of Steve Danuser&#8211;that&#8217;s me. I am a Creative Director at Sony Online Entertainment, where I led the design team on <em>Vanguard: Saga of Heroes</em> for a few months following its transition to Free to Play. I&#8217;m currently serving as Lead Content Designer and Loremaster of <em>EverQuest Next</em>, as well as contributing design work on <em>Landmark</em>.</p>
<p>From 2006 to 2012, I was the Creative Director at 38 Studios where I worked on an MMORPG codenamed <em><strong>Project Copernicus</strong> </em>and oversaw the development of our world&#8217;s massive story, which came alive in our single-player RPG called <strong><em>Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</em></strong>. Prior to that, I worked at Sony Online Entertainment as a community manager and game designer on <em>EverQuest II</em> and its expansions.</p>
<p>I must admit that I didn&#8217;t set out to get into this business. Having played computer RPGs such as the <em>Ultima </em>series ever since I got my first Atari 800 computer, I eventually found my way to the original <em>EverQuest</em>. Some friends and I started the original version of Mobhunter, which built up something of a following in the EQ community. After getting to know a number of the game&#8217;s devs, I was invited to interview for the community manager position on EQ2. It was my good fortune to be hired and to serve as one of the leads on the EQ2 project.</p>
<p>I spent about two years in that position before transitioning full time into game design. That covers everything from designing zones, to making quests, to assigning appearances to armor. I also, on occasion, wrote a post or two.</p>
<p>After completing my work on the <em>Echoes of Faydwer</em> expansion, I left SOE and accepted a position with Green Monster Games (which became 38 Studios) in Maynard, MA. Following 38&#8242;s epic collapse in 2012, I was welcomed back to SOE.</p>
<p>After blogging under the Moorgard.com URL or a while, I got the Mobhunter domain back in an effort to prove you <em>can </em>go home again. It&#8217;s a big web out there, and this is my little corner of it.</p>
<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ll find the rest of my writing to be more amusing than this page. Good luck.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have many talents in life, but chief among them is being able to blend disparate nonsense into something a tiny group of people will find vaguely interesting.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>This site expresses my personal views, not those of any present or past employers or coworkers. The articles here don&#8217;t represent the opinions of anyone other than me, so don&#8217;t try to attribute what I say to any company I happen to work for. <em>These postings are mine alone, have not been reviewed or approved by my employer and do not necessarily express the views of my employer.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be maintaining this site from home in my spare time, so you don&#8217;t have to worry that my writing here is taking away from balancing your class or fixing your most-hated bug.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, the purpose of this site isn&#8217;t for me to answer questions about the game I work on or the company I work for. While inevitably my articles will refer to the project I&#8217;m working on in various ways, I&#8217;m not going to reveal any secrets or post any details on the game that I wouldn&#8217;t answer on the official forums.</p>
<p>Comments that readers make to any of my articles should be attributed to whoever makes them. I don&#8217;t plan to censor anybody, unless I decide that I hate you.</p>
<p>Basically, life is too short to get bent out of shape about what you read online. And please remember, nobody ever proved they were smarter than someone else by making a post on the Internet. Except for me.</p>
