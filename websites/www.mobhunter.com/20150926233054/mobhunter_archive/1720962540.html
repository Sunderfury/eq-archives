Meeting minimum specs means that the game will load and run on your computer; it does not mean that the game will play in an enjoyable fashion. I hate to break this to you, but anyone playing Luclin on a P2-400 is going to be able to drink a couple cans of Mountain Dew between screen redraws.<p>Now granted, there are some new coding enhancements coming in Luclin that will lighten the burden on your machine. You will be able to control the level of ground detail, for example. Also, rather than render textures on every object on the player's screen (as is currently the case), textures will only be filled in on the sides that you can see. While this will increase efficiency greatly, bear in mind that objects will have many more polygons to draw. As we mentioned <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-1950098517">earlier</a>, player models have gone from 500 polygons to over 2000. That's a pretty significant increase, and I'm betting that it will pretty much negate the advantage of the new coding.<p>That being the case, what do you <I>really</I> need to be happy with Luclin? I'll use my own machines to give you a comparison.<p>The system I was playing on until about six months ago is a P3-450, 128 megs RAM, Voodoo 5. I still use it as a backup machine. On this setup, old world zones are smooth as silk, but I run into some problems in Kunark. My measure of how well a computer plays EQ is what I call the &quot;Burning Woods Test.&quot; The zoneline from Dreadlands to BW is enough to choke the framerates on many machines (damn those trees!), and the P3 is no exception. When turning in this area, it's like I'm moving in slow motion. You get the same thing in Warsliks Wood and a couple other places.<p>Velious is a little more demanding overall, especially with the new armor textures. Entering a raid situation with 40 or more players on the P3/Voodoo combo is enough to choke the system more than a little. While the snowy zones run pretty smoothly, Wakening Land is a place of noticably lower framerates.<p>My main system now is a 1gHz Athlon, 512 megs RAM, GeForce 3. This system handles the Burning Woods Test magnificently; it's smooth as an old-world zone. Wakening Land has no slowdown. Entering an area with 40 players in Velious armor still causes a momentary stutter, but it passes quickly. Overall, at 1024x768, EverQuest plays brilliantly on this machine.<p>In the six months since I've upgraded, of course, the state of the art has moved forward and prices have continued to plummet. So if you've decided to upgrade your PC to have the best Luclin experience possible, here are the Mobhunter recommendations for getting the best bang for your buck.<p><B>RAM</B> - There is no more cost-effective solution for upgrading your PC right now than adding more memory. The price of RAM is so ridiculously low that it amazes old-timers like me--I can remember paying a sickening amount of money for 16K memory modules for my Atari 800. You can get a 256 meg PC-133 SDRAM module for less than you'd pay for dinner and a movie. You have <I>absolutely</I> no excuse for having less than 256 megs of RAM in your system. You should have 512 at least, really.<p><B>CPU</B> - AMD still beats Intel in terms of price, and for purposes of EverQuest there is no difference in performance, so we'll talk AMD here. The place to look when shopping for CPUs is where you can get the fastest clock speed before a large jump in price. We'll use <a href="http://www.pricewatch.com/">Price Watch</a> for our examples. As of this writing, here are some prices of the popular Athlon XP chip:<p>$251 - Athlon XP 1900 <br>$188 - Athlon XP 1800 <br>$141 - Athlon XP 1700 <br>$112 - Athlon XP 1600 <br>$110 - Athlon XP 1500 <p>Notice how the 1.5 and 1.6 gHz pieces are nearly the same price, and the jump to the 1.7 gHz is more significant. Here's your sweet spot. The 1600 is the best value, but go ahead and buy the 1700 if you have a little extra cash to spend. The performance difference will be nil, but you'll be able to brag slightly more to your buddies.<p>As for motherboards, I've always had great luck with Abit and ASUS, but there are other good board makers as well. Spending a little more for a quality brand of motherboard is worth it. Don't skimp here!<p><B>Video</B> - You don't want to run Luclin on less than a GeForce 2 card, and the GeForce 3 is preferred. A GeForce 2 with 64 megs of RAM is under $100--again, a ridiculously low price. The top of the line card is a GeForce 3 Ti 500, though ATI's Radeon 8500 is nipping at its heels. Check out dedicated hardware sites like <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/">AnandTech</a> and <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/">Tom's Hardware Guide</a> for far more detail than I can provide you on these cards. Once again, the GeForce 2 is clearly the best bang for the buck, but spending cash on the hottest, fastest video card is one of the most tempting things for hardware junkies, so don't feel too bad if you blow mucho cash in this area.<p>Bigger, faster hard drives and more advanced sound cards are also considerations, though these will have a less dramatic impact on your system. A 7200 rpm hard drive is nice, and a Soundblaster 5.1 will keep you very happy.<p>One other very important feature in that recommended spec: broadband. You do have a cable modem or DSL, right? If either of these are offered in your area, I highly recommend subscribing. While EverQuest played great for me at 28.8 for two years, the joys of broadband cannot be overstated--especially if you run a Web site.<p>Okay, so you've got two weeks to get your machine in shape for Luclin. That's plenty of time to order the parts and make your computer fast and happy. Bear in mind that certain upgrades are linked--you usually can't upgrade your CPU without buying a new motherboard, and your old RAM may not work with that configuration, so do plenty of research at the sites listed above before you buy.<p>When you're ready, I'll see you in Luclin.
