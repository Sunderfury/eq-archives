<html><head><title>Wanna Play Star Raiders?</title></head><body><h1>Wanna Play Star Raiders?</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-09-28</p>Following are some comments that Brad had for us.<p>On who really made the sky:<p><B>The sky in EverQuest is actually a descendant of the sky used in our earlier game, Tanarus and was primarily coded by Shawn Baird. Then after it was put into EverQuest, John Buckley (graphics programmer) and Rosie Cosgrove (art lead) tweaked it a bit more. Then Scott McDaniel (art lead) and others added some additional skies (the desert sky, the Plane of Fear sky, etc.) It mostly involves taking a sky bitmap and then algorithmically modifying the colors and tints depending on the time of day to make it look like morning, noon, or night.</B><p>On the global texture files:<p><B>The global file exists for the much smaller subset of character models that could potentially be displayed in all zones (this would include all the player races and genders, pets, etc.). We purposely try to keep this file small, and we also have limits as to how many NPC models should be present in a zone specific file in order to keep memory requirements reasonable. That said, because min specs rise over time and RAM becomes cheaper, we've slowly but surely added to the global file and will most likely continue to do so in the future.</B><p>On changes in the weather:<p><B>We don't have specific plans to modify the weather by the Shadows of Luclin release, no. I'd love to see it enhanced later though, perhaps combined with a newer, more advanced particle engine (would allow us to do cool thinks like lightning bolts and such).</B><p>On potential changes to the user interface:<p><B>Much more of the UI will work in full screen mode, and it will also be more flexible and configurable, and it should also over time support other character/language sets. This is an ongoing project, though, that you'll see patched in over time.</B><p>On which parts of your computer system you may want to upgrade:<p><B>If you still plan on upgrading, though, I'd think the additional RAM would help the most - more RAM means less swapping and better load times. After that, more CPU is always good. As for a Geforce 3, we're not doing much that would give it a significant advantage over a Geforce 2.</B><p>We tend to disagree about that. Watch for an upcoming feature on the GeForce 3 coming soon.<p>On how armor won't just look different in Luclin, but will behave differently:<p><B>Some items will change the skins, and some will change both the skins and the character's geometry. Another neat feature is that when we tint these different skins and other textures, it won't necessarily change the color of the texture underneath - in other words, the new character models also support texture layering.</B><p>On why I still get swamped by greens in SolA:<p><B>There are really two reasons that green mobs still attack characters in most dungeons. <p>First, from an immersive standpoint, it doesn't make sense that an enemy could just cruise into a dungeon unimpeded. The mobs in a sense are attacking you as a group, in hope that they'll force you to flee or even kill you, even though they'll probably die themselves.<p>And from a game balance stand point, since there are many zones with green 'yard trash' but challenging 'boss' mobs, we don't really want players just waltzing through a dungeon to their target. There still needs to be at least some risk associated with doing so.<p>All in all, when this does happen, it probably (but not always) means that the level range differential in the zone is too great. And in 20/20 game design hindsight, this should typically be avoided - it's generally better that dungeons have a smaller level range differential.</B><p>On depth vs. bredth in MMORPGs:<p><B>So with EverQuest we decided to focus primarily on combat and adventure, and we are indeed proud of the depth, content, and game mechanics associated with 'dungeon crawling' and the like. And while it was a conscious choice to do this, we've certainly nothing against other games that focused initially on breadth (these are typically the skill based systems, which offer a lot more choices but less long-term detail in their various professions or skill-trees). <p>Will we at Verant ever pursue other aspects of character development or other advancement mechanisms? Well, actually, we already are. Star Wars: Galaxies is definitely a game focused initially more on breadth and player options. In fact, the Creative Director on the project, Raph Koster, was one of the lead designers on Ultima Online, which is also a skill based, breadth-focused game. So we're confident that SW:G will truly be the next step in the evolution of MMORPGs as they relate to a variety of professions and other less combat oriented paths of advancement (not that there won't be awesome battles there as well</B><p>On whether new zones are created off the cuff or planned in advance:<p><B>We do indeed have atlases and quite an extensive set of documents describing the world of Norrath, and it grows every day. There is a lot of detail regarding many places, events, and persons that either haven't been introduced yet in EverQuest or merely alluded to. There are also, as people have noticed, many places on the maps that come with the game to which you can't travel (yet :) ). The majority of those places have at least some pre-existing content associated with them, and many have even more. And then when a game designer sits down to work on a new area or to revamp an existing area, he often consults these documents, afterwards adding to them in detail.</B><p>And finally... the promised quote that proves Brad McQuaid has a good soul:<p><B>For me it was the superior Atari 8bit line of machines, but I don't want to re-start that old debate :)</B><p>What's to debate, Brad? The Atari 8-bit line ruled in its day (Csenicier will rave about the Color Computer--puh-leeze). Atari was way ahead of its time in terms of design, but they pretty much wrote the book on how to send an unbelievably successful tech company right down the tubes. The ST line was incredible as well, even if the real successor to the Atari 8-bit line was the Amiga (same people designed the custom chips). Too bad a nice computer like the Amiga was bought by a nasty company like Commodore--which also proved able to run itself into the ground.<p>Anyway, Atari rules, Commodore sucks, and we cheer Brad for saying so.<p>On a side note, Absor let eveyone <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000329.html">know</a> that yesterday's emergency patch was done to fix that nasty ASCII bug. So be sure to send him thanks if you got twice the normal number of mobs to kill this week.<p>In preparation for the roleplay server, Absor started a thread talking about what <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000330.html">inspires</a> you when creating a character. It borders on the warm-n-fuzzy, so we'll skip posting any highlights of it here.<p>Aradune popped in to clarify something on the RP server's emote rules:<p><B>The /emote command will use the language you are speaking, so it's not used to get around language restrictions. The canned emotes (for example, /smile, /wave, etc.), will still be readable by all, even if you don't understand the language spoken by the character smiling or waving.</B><p>/em i give u 500pp 4 that bp dood<br>/em cum on sell itt 2 me<br>/em u suk NEway<p>Darn, guess I'll have to come up with a new means of communication.
