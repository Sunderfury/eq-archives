But almost all of the character shots are just different views of the same models we've seen for a while now. Granted, there are some impressive NPC and landscape shots, but we really want to see character models, after all.<p>However, with the release of <a href="http://www.anarchyonline.com/">Anarchy Online</a> today, you can see why Verant would want to ensure that people are still paying attention.<p>And we really shouldn't complain. Any new Luclin shots are like free sample day at the methadone clinic for addicts like us.
