<html><head><title>Here Comes the Holiday</title></head><body><h1>Here Comes the Holiday</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-05-23</p><BIG>Piddity Piddity Patch</BIG><p>When they announced a patch was upcoming for Thursday morning, the masses got excited. Would we see the wider exp range? Melee balance issues addressed? Flagless PoP zones? So it was with wide, expectant eyes that we got up early and ran our patcher to find:<p><B>May 20, 2003  3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>** Paladin AA Act of Valor **<p>Fixed a problem with Act of Valor.  Use of this AA ability was causing zones to crash.  That shouldn't happen any more.</b><p>Huh? Okay, that was a sleeper. Most paladins didn't even buy this skill, but the few that did also got the mystical ability to bring zones down. As this wasn't quite the intended effect, the bug was fixed. It really wasn't worth waking up early for, though.<p>The <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp">Next Update</a> page on the EQ Live site seems to be saying that the big stuff will be coming on June 4. Well, I guess we have to wait a bit longer for something major to happen.<p><BIG>Test Is Where It's At</BIG><p>If you can't wait until June 4, drop on by the Test server, buff yourself up, and check out the nifty goodies mentioned in the latest patch message there:<p><B>May 22nd, 2003 <br>------------------------- <p>- New Camera - We've added a new camera mode to the game. You can only enter it from first person mode. Using the mouse wheel you can zoom the camera out into what is, basically, a chase camera. You can use the mouse wheel to determine the distance of the camera from your character, or to zoom back into first person mode. When in the chase mode, mouselook turns the character and camera together. <p>- Reporting Damage Over Time - Damage over Time (DoT) done to NPCs will now be reported to the caster of the DoT as it is done. <p>- Pathing Tuning - Fleeing NPCs should now run further away. Previously they would stop running somewhat short of spell range. NPCs will also avoid water whenever possible (except for fish...). Jumping off high cliffs is a less attractive option for NPCs now as well. Please continue to keep your eyes open for pathing issues, we appreciate the help you've given us so far. <p>- Summoning Spells - Summoning spells will now work with something on the cursor, but will stop working and warn the player when attempting to cast with 11 items on the cursor. <p>- Character Select Crash - Using the arrow keys to try to change the selected character with no characters on the account was causing people to crash out of the game. That's fixed. <p>- GMotD - We've fixed a problem with Guild Message of the Day that was causing all the players in the guild to crash under certain circumstances. <p>- Newbie Starting Locations - We've modified all locations where new characters start to make them a bit more convenient for the new player. If you start a new character, please take a moment to look around and see if you are in a reasonable starting location (you should be near your guild master) and not someplace odd, like under the world or in Vox's lair. <p>- Guild Window: &quot;Last On&quot; Time - The last on time displayed in the guild window was not being properly updated until the first the player zoned. It should be correct all the time now. <p>- Pets - Many pets were displaying a square under their name in parenthesis. They won't do that anymore.</b><p>Some helpful stuff, and the new camera angle may appeal to some. Of course, using it means you have to watch your own ridiculous character animations, but I digress.<p>Other changes on Test include a <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=39381.topic">new method of memming spells</a> that does away with that nasty ol' spellbook! Whoever thought casters would be liberated from that ancient, hideous interface. Roleplayers and luddites can still use the old book if it tickles their fancy, of course.<p>Lots of buzz has been going around about <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=31130.topic">group buffs no longer landing</a> on low-level characters. Enchanters and clerics will just have to find some other way to extort heaps of platinum from the masses, I guess, assuming the change goes live.<p>A frequent complaint is that SOE is making the early game too easy on newbies. The buff change shows that the goal is not to make the low levels meaningless, but to introduce challenges that are appropriate. Wrestling with a stupid spell book and struggling to find your guildmaster do not equal fun. But by the same token, allowing level 5 characters to run around with with ten times the amount of hitpoints and mana regen they should have is really what trivializes the content.<p><BIG>Games by the Pound</BIG><p>E3 is over, and it sounds like this year was a doosey. No, we're not just talking about the <a href="http://pub30.ezboard.com/fopaage87310frm2.showMessage?topicID=676.topic">debauchery</a> of the nVidia party <B>(WARNING - that link is NOT work safe!)</B>--we mean the games that were shown.<p>Some were <a href="http://vault.ign.com/articles/409/409585p1.html">blown away</a> by Horizons--the long-delayed MMORPG that we all assumed was vaporware and still might be, but now might not be. Lots of others were thrilled by Worlds of Warcraft, because it's made by a company that really really <I>really</I> cares about its customers and really really <I>really</I> releases perfect games, which means it will be the first MMORPG to ship bug-free and require no patches, ever. Honest. That FoH guy told me so.<p>A few people even liked EverQuest 2, enough to give an <a href="http://new-www.crgaming.com/e32003/viewarticle.asp?Id=150">award</a> that really doesn't mean anything. You can download a very clear 40 meg video (what, you don't have broadband?) that shows a walkthrough of several areas of the game.<p>Honestly, I was more impressed by the video than I thought I would be after reading <a href="http://www.rpgatlas.com/archives/00000014.htm">Muse's impressions</a> of the demo. The graphics and character customization look tremendous, with the ability to finally create a truly individualized character. NPC interaction was streamlined with a window that popped up showing dialogue, allowing the user to click on responses rather than type them out.<p>Of course, I winced when I saw EQ2's framerates. Being near even a couple of those highly detailed NPCs caused visible slowdown--and we have to assume the game was being shown on a very beefy machine. While the graphics engine probably isn't completely optimized yet, just the thought of being on a raid with 50 people is making my GeForce 4 consider a preemptive meltdown. Dedicated gamers will want to look at an ATI 9800 Pro or one of the just-announced GeForce 5900 Ultra boards--which seem to <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1821">stack up</a> much better against the ATI than the pitiful FX did.<p>Once again, let me be clear; we don't really know what the future of this next wave of games will hold. Warcraft may turn out to be the messiah that all the Fittoheads are proclaiming it to be. Horizons may shock us and actually be released, and may even be good. Or a darkhorse like <a href="http://www.lineage2.com/main_eng.html">Lineage 2</a> might surprise us all. It will be the content that determines which of these are successful, and which will find their way into the dustbin of online history.<p>By the way, it seems EQ2 will be coming out with <a href="http://www.eqlounge.com/news/display.php?id=5">a choice of box art</a>. We're betting the bad guy sells better, despite not being as hot as Ms. Bayle.<p><BIG>Time Waits for No Man</BIG><p>Guilds like <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife</a> and <a href="http://www.townrebels.org">Township Rebellion</a> have been playing in Plane of Time for a couple weeks now, and--after a myriad of zone tunings--have begun to kill the gods within. The loot is impressive, less for the modest stat gain on many of the pieces than for the mysterious effects they possess. Not all of which are easy to figure out, mind you, but hopefully the promise of the items lives up to the difficulty in obtaining them.<p>Furor (who retired, but still talks about EQ) pointed out an <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=3bc552f502682109320dc300f541be98&amp;threadid=7297">impending bottleneck</a> when multiple guilds reach Time on a given server. Because it takes like half a day to get to the good stuff, guilds could potentially leapfrog each other and essentially steal content that the other guild worked for.<p>Not that this is anything new, of course. Guilds have leapfrogged each other in Fear (thanks for leaving Cazic up for us), Growth (Tunare all alone? you have one try to kill her before we get our turn), NToV, and probably even Vex Thal. Situations that Furor claims will require GM interaction will mostly depend upon player courtesy and honor to resolve, just like they always have.<p>Okay, you can stop snickering now.<p>Admittedly, the design of Plane of Time really screams out for instancing--the spawning of completely different versions of the same zone so that multiple raids can enjoy the same content without racing or competing. This concept wasn't dreamed up yesterday, and is in fact planned for use in EQ2 and the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion. I mean, if you're going to require a guild to raid for 12 hours straight, they should at least be able to rest easy knowing that their content won't be ganked by someone else.<p>Plane of Time is a work in progress, of course. Silly restrictions like Call of the Hero not working need to go away, and hopefully there will be some way for guilds to stop at a safe point and resume the raid later without reclearing a mess of worthless mobs. If instancing could be added (assuming it isn't there already), then the zone might end up being the reward it presumably is meant to be.<p><B>*** Updated ***</B><p>Looks like Afterlife hit another snag in Time, according to their <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">latest update</a>. While a bug of some kind is at fault, it's really the customer service policies that are getting in the way here. When people play by the rules and the content screws them, GMs should be empowered to help the players--not prevented from doing the right thing by red tape. Read Thott's update for the full story.<p>At any rate, have a great Memorial Day weekend. But amidst the cookouts and relaxation, don't forget about those who are no longer with us, to whom this day is dedicated.
