		<description><![CDATA[I agree entirely with the review of the ending.  This might have made a lot of sense in the context of an ongoing series, or some other sequel where we would be able to explore what happens to the good (horrible) doctor as a result of this tragic past.  In the context of a one-and-done story, however, it was a disappointment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was a little disappointed in the ending as well.  I love pretty much all of the stuff Whedon has done (Buffy, Firefly, Angel) and I like the unconventional &quot;it doesn&#039;t wrap up in a perfectly happy ending&quot; aspect. But I think sometimes the stuff goes a little too far in that direction.  You come to know that there will be no happy ending so you don&#039;t bother hoping for it.  Ep 1 and 2 were good and 3 was pretty good but the fact that the girl died was no surprise and I was kind of disappointed that it actually happened.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure Joss Whedon is planning on doing more Dr. Horrible web-episodes in which case it makes sense not to end on a happy note with everything all wrapped up. I can&#039;t help but feel that a lot of people didn&#039;t like Act 3 because the Internet seems to have a crush on Felcia Day. Don&#039;t worry Internet, it&#039;s Joss Whedon, I&#039;m sure Penny can come back as a ghost or zombie or something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought it was pretty solid, but I watched it with Zero expectations going in. I saw a few links that mentioned it was a good watch, and that&#039;s it. If I&#039;d caught the same pre-vieiwing vibe as you, i&#039;d have probably been disappointed. But having missed all the hype, it proved to be an enoyable show that I&#039;ve gone on to recommend to several others.  (There&#039;s a lesson there for MMO companies and prelaunch hype machines). ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[**Possible Spoilers Warning**


I went in thinking we would get a sugared down, good-guy-that&#039;s-really-the-bad-guy gets the girl in the end and I was happy to find that it was more involved and emotional than just trying to deliver a happy ending.  So, I guess that can be boiled down to just disagreement between us.

Also, I don&#039;t feel that the likability of Dr. Horrible was ever taken away.  When he became more resolute in his final goal, it was made all that more easier to go along with by the continuing evolution of Captain Hammer, from good guy to self-centered, uncaring vigilante.  Especially considering that his evil was directed at someone out of love for another, he could have just as easily have killed that kid or grandmother if he was really evil.]]></description>
