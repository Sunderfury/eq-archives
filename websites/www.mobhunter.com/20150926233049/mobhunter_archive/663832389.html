You can also read Absor's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html">lengthy thread</a> that talks about some other Sullon Zek issues.<p>Let me give you the Reader's Digest version.<p>Sullon Zek is divided into three teams: good, neutral, and evil. Each of these teams can attack the others, within certain level limits.<p>Some players on the &quot;good&quot; team are worried because there are someting like four times as many evil players. The good guys want a way to ensure balance so that evil doesn't rule the world.<p>Abashi's latest suggestion to achieve balance is as follows:<p><i>Our idea is this, in the words of EQLive's Assistant Producer Bill &quot;Solist&quot; Coyle, what's the one thing throughout fantasy literature that has made it possible for Good to stand their ground and beat back the overwhelming forces of Evil? <p>/em plays some suspenseful music...<p>                            .<br>                            .<br>                            .<p>Wait for it....<br>                            .<br>                            .<br>                            .<p>Why, it's the fact that Evil eventually turns on itself. <p><b>Duh duh duh duuuuuum!</B><p>Our idea is, simply, allow Team Evil to attack each other... </I><p>If you ask me, that's a pretty interesting idea. We're sending Bill Coyle a Mobhunter t-shirt in the hopes that it will inspire him to come up with similarly great ideas for the non-PvP servers.<p>A lot of people scream about how little the EQ engine encourages real roleplaying. Well, here's an example of Verant trying to make roleplaying more viable. Let's hope the players on the newest Zek embrace this idea. It might even inspire me to try Sullon out.<p>Being the outnumbered good guy does have a kind of mythic appeal, after all.
