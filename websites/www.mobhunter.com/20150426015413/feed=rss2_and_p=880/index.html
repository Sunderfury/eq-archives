		<description><![CDATA[Your framing of the Kickstarter relationship as an investor relationship is exactly my objection to this.  As you said, it potentially lets the creators get the necessary funds to build their product (and incidentally minimize if not eliminate their risk) but it really doesn&#039;t treat the person who gives of their money as an investor.

Sure, they may get some token item and a &quot;free&quot; copy of the product but at the end of the day the creators are getting profit and the investors are not getting an actual ROI on their investment.  I&#039;m sure there are a number of good reasons, including legal ones, to not create a true investor relationship but I can&#039;t get over the hurdle of funding somebody and not getting a part of the profits after the fact.]]></description>
