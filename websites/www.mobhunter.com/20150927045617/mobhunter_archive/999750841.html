<html><head><title>The Second At Bat</title></head><body><h1>The Second At Bat</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-10-17</p>Here's the newest patch message in all its splendor:<p><B>October 17, 2002  3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>- Some NPCs were unable to cast Area Effect spells and other innate abilities.  This would have caused many of the recently retuned NPCs to be considerably easier than intended.<p>- Updated the range on the Magician spell Rod of Mystical Transvergence. <p>- Rods of Transvergence and Modulation Rods can no longer be used by those who do not have enough maximum hit points to survive the mana conversion.  Please note: That is MAXIMUM hit points!  It is still possible for appropriate level characters to rod themselves to death.<p>- Barbarian Beastlords will once again return to summoning their own dogs.  Not someone else's.  If you were summoning a dog that didn't appear familiar, please do not worry.  Your own dog has returned.  He missed you.  Please feed him.<p>- Altered the stacking for the Shaman spell Voice of the Berserker to match the other spells in its line.<p>- Aura of White Petals has been updated to have its strength as it was prior to its stacking changes. <p>- In the original patch yesterday morning, /SHIELD was added as an innate ability that all Warriors now gain at level 35.  Warriors may now choose to take a portion of melee damage that is intended for another.  Warriors, please type /SHIELD for a full description of this ability.  You may find that it assists you greatly in your groups.<p>Correspondingly, NPCs and Pets over level 30 who are Warriors were granted this ability as well.  Certain NPCs and Pets may choose to protect beings that they have an affinity for, if they believe that it will benefit the shielded being.  For now, however, there is not yet a way to manually cause or prevent this behavior in pets.</B><p>So the Emperor and the Cursed got their fangs back, assuming these boys are once again in the game. There were <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=77b733e69c8deb2763e3d5175300025d&amp;threadid=12569">similar reports</a> of AoE mobs in NToV and other places not working right, but from personal experience I can tell you that mobs like the High Priest in Ssra and Ventani in ST were functioning normally, so the accuracy of some of these claims is hard to judge.<p>I'm not sure what the range on the mod rod spell is now. Frankly, I learned pretty quickly to take the first one I was given and stick it away in a bag and just live with the &quot;duplicate lore items not allowed&quot; message. Of course, when I turned up naked in Nexus after some mobs decided it would be fun to test my tanking ability, I'd get rods on my cursor faster than I could delete them. At least we can hope that people like this <a href="http://www.thedailybull.ca/article.php?id=128">don't breed</a>.<p>Paladins are upset that their Yaulp spells are <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=16896.topic">still broken</a> in that they drain stamina instead of giving it. Me, I don't even display my stamina bar in my custom UI, but some people swear by it. In any case, the spells are definitely screwed up and certainly need to be fixed. Maybe Monday's patch will do it.<p>At any rate, it's another patch day with another race for killable mobs. Have fun, kiddies.
