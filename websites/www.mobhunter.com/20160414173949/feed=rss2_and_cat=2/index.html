				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a few months of convalescing after the big layoff, I now begin the next phase of my career. I have accepted a position at Blizzard Entertainment working on World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting step for me. Blizzard has a proven track record of shipping quality products, and as a longtime lover of MMOs, it&#8217;s a thrill to go to work on the most successful title my favorite genre has ever seen. It will be a huge honor and challenge to try to make my own mark on the game. An added bonus is reuniting with a bunch of my former 38 colleagues who also work at Blizzard. This is going to be fun!</p>
<p>For reference, the title of this post refers to the big milestones in my career since moving into game development. Phase one was starting at SOE back in 2003. Phase two was helping found 38 Studios in 2006. Phase three was my return to SOE in 2012. Phase four begins now, in May of 2015.</p>
<p>Many folks would be happy to have enjoyed just one of those experiences, so I count myself as very fortunate to be given the opportunity to continue my journey. Thanks for all your support over the last few months, and I hope I can count on it going forward.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first heard of Kickstarter, the proposition seemed straightforward and awesome. A smaller developer has a great idea and huge passion but can&#8217;t find a publisher willing to front their modest budget, so they fire off a campaign and let the market decide whether it&#8217;s worth backing. The developer has a team in place ready to go, knows the tech required to pull it off, and really only requires the cash. Seems ingenious. And frankly, since that isn&#8217;t the realm of game development I spend my time in, I really didn&#8217;t give it a lot of thought beyond that.</p>
<p>But after some high-profile Kickstarter debacles in which funded projects failed to deliver or required more than their initial ask, crowdfunding has come under increased scrutiny. As it should be&#8211;when you contribute to a campaign, you are an investor, and you shouldn&#8217;t be throwing your money into a black hole. Certainly the stumbles have caused me to rethink my initial perception.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was generally understood all along and I&#8217;m only just now getting it, but clearly Kickstarter is often less about &#8220;Money is the final piece I need to make this game, can I please have some?&#8221; and more about &#8220;We have this awesome idea and need your money to have even a chance of making it.&#8221; Which can be okay, so long as the expectation of funding hope rather than enabling completion is clear up front.</p>
<p>The problem is, it&#8217;s rare to see a campaign present itself that way. For me, a lot of it comes down to the promises being made. If you&#8217;re part of the team that has planned the project out and just needs $500k to make the game, then it is very prudent (and fun) to add stretch goals for what happens if you actually bring in $600k, $700k, and so forth. But if your ask is essentially for seed money to attract the <em>real</em> investors, then that initial crowdfunding goal is about making a vertical slice or demo, and anything beyond that should really only have the stretch goal of, you know, making a deeper, more polished demo. When you look at the perks being offered to higher-level contributors on such projects, you tend to see the same vanity items and feature creep common to just about every campaign.</p>
<p>Again, maybe I&#8217;m just naive for only now realizing this. But if the following point isn&#8217;t clear to you already, I hope you at least take away this one thing from my post: Giving a million bucks in seed money to keep a developer&#8217;s lights on while they seek out the $20+ million they <em>actually</em> need to make their game is <em>orders of magnitude</em> more risky than funding a three-person team that only needs a bit more cash to make it to the finish line. Yes, the world is full of rich investors, but&#8211;trust me on this&#8211;finding the right people willing to invest in making games (especially MMOs) is no easy feat. In the meantime, <strong>your</strong> hard-earned green is feeding those developers. This is high-risk investment, folks. Don&#8217;t do it unless you haveÂ  money to lose.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding asks like this can be done responsibly and in a way that frames expectations correctly, but transparency&#8211;especially upfront&#8211;is absolutely crucial. Know what you&#8217;re getting into before you give anyone your money is the foundation of smart business. Seeing a developer with passion is great and something we all want to encourage, but make sure that passion has a clear and achievable plan behind it. Cool ideas are common and cheap; it&#8217;s proper execution that&#8217;s rare and expensive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes people assume that, because I specialize in narrative design, I think every game needs to be saturated with story. But in fact, I look at it from the opposite point of view: What is the minimum amount of story needed for the game being made?</p>
<p>Excess story is a waste of resources and potentially gets in the way of play. Hey, I&#8217;m a gamer too, and I don&#8217;t like clicking through needless dialogue or extraneous cut-scenes any more than you do. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t love well-done dialogue and cut-scenes, because when used correctly, they are powerful tools that can enhance your experience. But I like to focus on finding the most concise path to conveying the most effective story. And often that means doing less, not more.</p>
<p>Of course, some types of games demand a big, sprawling narrative. The <em>Mass Effect</em> series wouldn&#8217;t be what it is without complex dialogue trees and detailed cinematics; they&#8217;re part and parcel of the experience. But <em>Frogger</em> wouldn&#8217;t be any more fun if you understood the protagonist&#8217;s childhood or explored the world&#8217;s political struggles; it&#8217;s enough to know you&#8217;re playing a frog who needs to cross roads and rivers to get home. Building games like <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Landmark</em> are another type that benefits from having a loose narrative at best, allowing the player to imagine as much (or as little) story as they like.</p>
<p>The nature of the sandbox MMO is to eschew formal narrative in favor of free-form play. That doesn&#8217;t mean your world shouldn&#8217;t have a rich and detailed backstory. On the contrary, I&#8217;d argue that sandboxes benefit from deep histories even more than structured narrative games do, because it provides a wealth of story for players to find on their own. Bits of story are embedded in the world awaiting discovery instead of being served up on a quest-journal platter.</p>
<p>But it all comes back to finding the right fit for the game you&#8217;re working on. As much as creating the tale itself, the role of a narrative lead is to pare the story down to its minimalist core. Part of being a memorable storyteller is being a judicious editor.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A look back at my time on Vanguard, and my feelings now that the game has gone dark.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 6pm PST on July 31, 2014, the servers for Vanguard: Saga of Heroes went dark. I wasn&#8217;t on the team that originated the game at Sigil, but I served as its Creative Director for a number of months upon my return to SOE in 2012.</p>
<p>It was a series of unlikely events that led to me working on Vanguard. I&#8217;d just spent the last five-and-a-half years on Copernicus, which was built on fresh tech and the best art assets an MMO had ever seen. After four months on the job hunt, I&#8217;d accepted a design job at a studio focused on console and mobile titles when I got the call inviting me back to SOE.Â  Though I was looking forward to trying my hand with other types of games, MMOs are my first love, and the idea of reuniting with old friends in San Diego was a big draw. I knew my ultimate destination would be the EQNext team, but I was asked to first help with an attempt to revitalize Vanguard. After weighing my options, I returned to San Diego determined to do my best for a game with one of the most storied histories in the genre.</p>
<p>Working on Vanguard was never easy. It was an aged title by the time I got to it, and although faster PCs allowed it to run better than it had back at its 2007 release, it was still plagued by technical problems resulting from architectural decisions made early on. Its content was a mess, ranging wildly in quality from inventive to abysmal. There were significant bugs everywhere, many of them years old. And while the design tools put a lot of flexibility into developers&#8217; hands, its many idiosyncrasies intersected with a database awash in the detritus of years of half-finished work. Every bug we fixed seemed to come with an unintended side-effect. Change the name of an item and some unrelated field would get zeroed out. Adjust one stat and other variables would be altered without telling you. Lack of version control meant you had to hunt through screen shots or ask players what an item used to be like before it got unintentionally nerfed. There were a lot of days when I would literally sit with my head in my hands, flummoxed at how some feature or another could possibly have been implemented in such a convoluted way.</p>
<p>And yet, I grew to love the game.<span id="more-822"></span></p>
<p>This was due almost entirely to the small but passionate group of players who managed to look beyond the mess and find the beauty in Vanguard. I don&#8217;t mean how the game looked, although Vanguard did have some of the loveliest vistas you could find in an MMO thanks to its sprawling open world (environments generally looked better from a distance than they did close up). No, these players found beauty in the challenge and adversity that had quickly whittled Vanguard&#8217;s audience down from respectable box sales to a small crew of diehards.</p>
<p>These hardy souls stuck with the game through long periods of neglect when literally no new content appeared. Sure, they had their moments of bitterness, and rightfully so, but their bond with one another outweighed the negatives. They did their best to recruit new players to the game, but poor performance and lingering bugs meant not a lot of those visitors stuck around.</p>
<p>The free-to-play renaissance gave Vanguard a chance. A team was built up and the game was dusted off. Work was done under the hood to support the FTP model, and attention was paid to the starting experience in order to make new players coming in a bit more welcome. Veterans became hopeful&#8211;or at least cautiously optimistic. I came on board after the game went free and some content updates had already rolled out. We had a tech director who knew his stuff, a veteran producer, a talented art director, and a team of people who wanted to see Vanguard succeed. Many of them had been there during the Sigil days and had long wanted to give the game the chance it deserved.</p>
<p>For a time, our chances looked good. Being on Steam brought us attention and some new faces. The in-game store had periods of decent sales. We had a promising trajectory to build upon.</p>
<p>Sadly, it didn&#8217;t last.</p>
<p>In the years that Vanguard languished, the MMO landscape had kept moving. When Vanguard was released, there were still only a handful of active MMOs on the market, but it didn&#8217;t take long before new massively multiplayer titles were crawling out of the woodwork. Players had more and more choices all the time, many of them taking the genre in different directions (or at least featuring significantly higher production values) while Vanguard stood still. It was hard to attract players when there were so many newer, shinier alternatives.</p>
<p>Ultimately there were just too many gaping holes to patch. A major revamp of the network code came too late to help build an audience. And with the state the game was in, adding polished content was simply too costly and time-consuming given the size of our audience. The team shrank as most of us were shifted to other games, and I joined the team making EQNext and Landmark.</p>
<p>While sunsetting a game is inevitably going to cause hurt feelings among players, the truth is that SOE gave the game a lot of chances. Most other companies would have pulled the plug after the initial downturn in subscriptions. Instead, the game was kept alive for over seven years, and fans who wanted a challenging open world MMO had a place to call home for an awfully long time.</p>
<p>By any objective benchmark, Vanguard was never a great game. But the love we have for MMOs isn&#8217;t about benchmarks&#8211;it&#8217;s about heart. And the game&#8217;s promise, its potential, took hold in the hearts of a core group of fans. They loved the experience despite its flaws, and found those moments of beauty to cling to. In the end, Vanguard was about community and camaraderie, about pride in overcoming adversity together. And it&#8217;s that kind of abiding passion that makes me so proud and excited to work on MMOs, because no other type of game has quite the same potential.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to say I logged in for the game&#8217;s final hour. I helped summon people to an unreleased zone to show them a bit of what might haveÂ  been and got the chance to say farewell to many friends. It was bittersweet, to be sure, but I choose to remember the sweet.</p>
<p>Rest well, Vanguard. You&#8217;ve earned your place among the stars.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Later this week I&#8217;ll be participating in <a title="Sorry, it's sold out" href="https://www.soe.com/soelive/" target="_blank">SOE Live 2013</a> (the event once known as Fan Faire) in lovely Las Vegas. It&#8217;s at Planet Hollywood this year, so it will be interesting to be in a new venue.</p>
<p>This will be the biggest SOE fan gathering in a number of years, no doubt in large part because of the big reveal of EverQuest Next. I&#8217;ve been on the EQN team for a number of months now, contributing to narrative and game design. There&#8217;s a lot of really cool and different things happening, so I&#8217;m excited to see the public&#8217;s reaction.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be participating on two panels: the World of EQN, which is Friday at 5pm, and the Lore of EQN panel on Saturday at 2pm. Be sure to say hello if you&#8217;re attending. Even after the reveal I won&#8217;t be able to answer every question, but we&#8217;ll finally be out of the black box at least.</p>
<p>Buying me drinks won&#8217;t get me to say anything I shouldn&#8217;t&#8230;but you&#8217;re welcome to try!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After playing some Guild Wars 2 for a while, I finally decided to fire up Mists of Pandaria and see what WoW has been up to. Although I had a higher-level death knight, I decided to yank my good-old level 70 arms warrior from retirement (the undead fellow who still decorates the banner of this site) and see how I fared.</p>
<p>Checking out Pandaria on this guy, of course, required that I play through Lich King and Cataclysm as well. This dampened my enthusiasm, as I&#8217;d already played through a lot of that stuff on my death knight, and I hate repeating content. So I opted for dungeon finder, and found myself having a ball. As the ultimate non-commitment tool, dungeon finder allowed me to sail through XP and gear acquisition without having to repeat the Lich King quests I&#8217;d previously completed. And if I screwed up, it was no big deal&#8211;it wasn&#8217;t like I&#8217;d ever see any of the people I was grouped with again. The Wrath dungeons are a lot of fun, so I enjoyed myself quite a bit, and my warrior was 80 in no time.</p>
<p>Playing through Cataclysm was less fun. The XP curve from 80 to 85 was slower, and I found the dungeons in this expansion far less enjoyable. It&#8217;s not that they were more difficult really; it&#8217;s that the same tricks seemed to be used over and over, as I was endlessly looking for burning spots on the ground to avoid. To pad my XP gains, I ended up playing through the whole underwater zone as well, which I found abysmal (pun intended). I mean, it was fine and all, but the design of the quests felt a little uninspired. The one exception was the naga city where you enter a vision and play through the invasion that had happened there&#8211;I thought that was a cool line with a nice payoff. I was surprised how buggy the content was after all this time, though. Because Blizzard does such a nice job of polishing their work, any problem really stands out. I ran into several places where I had to abandon quests and do them over again because a trigger didn&#8217;t work right or something. Still, all things considered, it was far beyond the level of polish most MMOs attain. I hit 85 and was forced to leave, even though I would have liked to check out Deepholm. I flew around that zone and it looked fantastic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently level 87 in Pandaria, and so far I&#8217;ve been extremely impressed. Both the solo content and the dungeons have been really well done. Cut scenes and cinematics are regularly worked into the content, and the pacing feels very nice. The WoW team has gotten a handle on using phasing to effectively tell stories and show change. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything, but the culmination of the Jade Forest quests was extremely impressive. This zone felt like the best example of storytelling I&#8217;ve seen in any MMO to date&#8211;newer titles included.</p>
<p>At this point, the biggest negative I can point out is that WoW feels burdened by its aging quest mechanics. The whole paradigm of walking into a hub and loading up my quest journal feels so old and dated. I much prefer the GW2 approach of entering an area and being given objectives relevant to what I can see going on around me. Instead of being ordered to kill 10 of this and collect 8 of that, I&#8217;m urged to defend the keep, drive out the centaurs, and other goal-oriented play. It&#8217;s a distinction purely of presentation&#8211;you end up collecting X of this and killing Y of that&#8211;but one method makes the world feel much more alive than the other. The rare moments in WoW when I can forget about the quest journal and just engage with the content are by far my favorites.</p>
<p>Not sure what I&#8217;ll do when I hit the level cap, but for now I&#8217;m very much enjoying my return to Azeroth&#8211;monkey poop and all.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In their book, Glued to Games: How Video Games Draw Us In and Hold Us Spellbound, Rigby and Ryan describe &#8220;self-determination theory,&#8221; a fairly well established framework that aims to describe why people pursue certain voluntary activities. In part, self-determination theory says that people are motivated to engage in activities to the extent that they satisfy three psychological needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Competence &#8211; progressing in skill and power.</li>
<li>2. Autonomy &#8211; being able to choose from multiple, meaningful options.</li>
<li>3. Relatedness &#8211; feeling important to others.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The article asserts that most shooters do a pretty good job of meeting these three needs, although studies indicate the games could be just as satisfying without all the blood and headshots. It&#8217;s worth a read.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about how MMOs come at the three needs outlined above.</p>
<p><strong>Competence</strong></p>
<p>One could argue that the entire <a title="Hello, father." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD" target="_blank">DikuMUD</a> style (which was a dominant influence on EverQuest, and therefore most of the MMOs that followed it) is built to satisfy this need: you gain levels or skills, hunt for new and better items, take on increasingly more powerful opponents, <em>ad infinitum</em>. And certainly if you look at early games in the genre, they allowed for the types of emergent gameplay that made players feel skilled and powerful. As an EQ monk called upon to pull in Plane of Fear, Temple of Veeshan, or for raids like the Avatar of War, I felt pride in the skills I possessed which made me better than the average player of my class.</p>
<p>However, one of the frequent complaints about MMOs&#8211;particularly as they age&#8211;is that they&#8217;ve been &#8220;dumbed down&#8221;, made easier for less-skilled players to succeed at. The long list of changes to WoW&#8217;s talent system is an often-cited example of this trend.</p>
<p>We have to admit that MMOs today get mixed marks in this category. Accessibility is a key pillar of most triple-A MMO projects so that the game has the best chance possible of recouping its extravagant budget, and in the process, player competence typically isn&#8217;t a priority target for developers&#8211;even though they often claim that it is. Accessibility is the enemy of player competence.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p>
<p>Using the article&#8217;s definition of this word, MMOs get mixed marks here as well. On the good side, MMOs tend to give players multiple types of content to choose from: leveling up a character solo, doing group dungeons, raiding, crafting, PvP, pet battles, house decorating, dungeon designing, collecting, achievements, and other forms of play are common in MMOs. That&#8217;s a nice variety not present in most other genres.</p>
<p>However, once you delve into each path in detail, it&#8217;s apparent that autonomy isn&#8217;t really present. Most paths in triple-A MMOs, be they narrative-based or achievement-focused, tend to be very linear and without a lot of choice. You might be able to pick which zone you go to at a given level range or which instance you&#8217;ll run, but once that decision is made, you&#8217;re locked in. You can&#8217;t choose how to solve a quest. You can&#8217;t choose the strategy for killing a boss. You can&#8217;t make up your own recipes for making items. You&#8217;re limited to a certain type of housing item or paint color.</p>
<p>MMOs are better at giving you the illusion of autonomy rather than the reality of it. Problems tend to get solved once, and then that becomes the <em>de facto</em> strategy for achieving the desire result (and you get yelled at if you try a different approach). While there are certainly exceptions to this trend, they are few and far between&#8211;at least among triple-A titles.</p>
<p><strong>Relatedness</strong></p>
<p>Importance to others is where MMOs shine. Just about every aspect of MMO gameplay is done better by other genres of games&#8211;shooters are better at fast action, single-player RPGs are better at telling cinematic stories, etc.&#8211;but at least so far, nobody beats MMOs at the social aspects. (Note: This is changing fast! Developers, plan your careers accordingly.)</p>
<p>Skilled players are crucial to a raiding guild. Helpful crafters are the cornerstone of any social guild. Nice people willing to help out someone in trouble allow for those priceless moments of player-to-player interaction that make these games so sticky. Players are the glue that hold MMOs together.</p>
<p>And yet, even MMOs don&#8217;t get a perfect mark here. WoW&#8217;s dungeon finder is the best (worst?) example I can think of. While I have fun jumping easily into content and leaving with shiny new items, all I do is select my role and get pulled into the adventure with a bunch of other players I don&#8217;t know and probably won&#8217;t say a word to unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong. WoW can get away with it because they have so many players and so much to do in the game, yet for smaller titles this would be a terribly depersonalizing experience. Automated matchmaking gets players to the content faster, but ultimately undermine relatedness. When the appeal of the content runs out, players are left with fewer social times to the game itself. This leads to churn, which most MMOs that aren&#8217;t named World of Warcraft are unlikely to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While current MMOs have a lot going for them, in many ways they have strayed from the early principles that actually satisfied competence, autonomy, and relatedness really well. High production values and expensive cut scenes don&#8217;t make up for these losses. The more you try to force an MMO to feel like another type of game, the less it feels like a distinct genre and the farther you get from the core experiences that made MMOs so popular.</p>
<p>It should be noted that most of my observations above are focused on triple-A themepark MMOs. There are certainly smaller, independent projects that are doing a better job of hitting these marks. Ultimately, it may be refocusing on these core principles that returns the MMO genre to its glory days; if not, its best features will likely be absorbed into other genres. Depending how you look at things, this has already happened and will only escalate from here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looks like it&#8217;s been a while since I posted anything that wasn&#8217;t mopey. A rough few months will do that to you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to be able to deliver happier news: I am once again gainfully employed, at the place where my career in games began: Sony Online Entertainment. I lead the design team as Creative Director on Vanguard, which has recently been converted into a free-to-play title.</p>
<p>It was an unexpected turn of events that led me back. Truth be told, I&#8217;d accepted a position at another company in a different state, but an old friend called with an offer I couldn&#8217;t refuse. Though I&#8217;d been away nearly six years, the folks at SOE have made me feel very welcome&#8211;a fantastic feeling.</p>
<p>So, why SOE? And why Vanguard?</p>
<p>Though being part of an epic collapse after years spent working on a large-scale MMO tends to have a negative effect on one&#8217;s psyche, ultimately I love this genre and couldn&#8217;t bear to stay away from it. There&#8217;s simply no challenge in game development like it. And yes, it&#8217;s risky, but when it works it&#8217;s very satisfying. I loved my time at SOE and made many great friends, so being asked back was a true honor.</p>
<p>As for Vanguard, I have a certain personal history with the title. I was community manager on EQ2 while Vanguard was in development, and I heard from a lot of people who told me how the latter was going to stomp all over the former. But despite some initial hard feelings over that flack, I couldn&#8217;t help but root for Vanguard; as an old-school EQ fanboy, it sounded like the type of game I really wanted to play. I was genuinely disappointed at the state of the game at launch and how it dwindled soon after.</p>
<p>But things change. After surviving with almost no development support for years, the conversion to free-to-play has breathed new life into the game&#8211;enough that SOE has made a serious commitment to it. Thus the hiring of folks like me, as well as bringing back some others who&#8217;ve worked on Vanguard in the past. It&#8217;s a lean, dedicated team made up of people who love the game and want to see it live up to its potential. Especially after the events of recent months, that&#8217;s the kind of redemption story I can really get behind.</p>
<p>Working on a live game again feels good, and making my way back to the <a title="My new turf!" href="http://forums.station.sony.com/vg/forums/list.m" target="_blank">forums</a> is exciting too. I&#8217;ve even got FanFaire&#8211;er, <a title="In Vegas, natch." href="http://www.soe.com/soelive/" target="_blank">SOE Live</a> this week!</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to homecomings&#8230; and happier days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have started and abandoned several posts over the past few weeks. I knew I needed to write something&#8230; but what story did I want to tell? An angry tirade about being screwed over? A scathing tell-all about what really happened inside 38? A self-pitying plea for a job? So many emotions inside me, a turbid swirl screaming for an outlet.</p>
<p>So this is what I&#8217;ve come up with.</p>
<p><span id="more-703"></span></p>
<p>It has been nearly a month since all of this began. Try to picture that; a month ago, everything seemed fine. Over the past 30 days, so many rugs have been pulled out from under me and my colleagues that I&#8217;ve lost count of the threads. We&#8217;ve lost our income, our insurance, our camaraderie. It&#8217;s been one slap in the face after another, and 38&#8217;s bankruptcy keeps finding new ways to hurt us all; just yesterday, we found out that our 401K funds are frozen for an indeterminate amount of time. I have no doubt that things will get more painful before they get better.</p>
<p>Emotions? Had &#8216;em all. Screaming rage, blinding tears, pity for myself, pity for others, defiance, numbness, fear. To an outsider, I can see how some of this might seem silly. It&#8217;s just a video game, right? People lose their jobs all the time&#8211;suck it up and find another one.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s just not that simple. I&#8217;ve spent nearly six years of my life building this company and working on this game. I&#8217;ve forged some very deep, personal bonds with the people I&#8217;ve worked with. Over this time, my life has changed in profound ways. I&#8217;ve seen my child come into this world. I nearly lost her and my wife in a fatal car crash. I&#8217;ve held my mother in my arms as she lay dying. And through all those things, I&#8217;ve been helped and comforted by Curt Schilling and my teammates at 38.</p>
<p>Work was tough and the pressure relentless, but so, so joyous as well. I got to work hands-on with R. A. Salvatore, taking the framework of a world he created and building it into something huge, ambitious, and wonderful. I watched amazing artists undertake the most startling transformation of concept paintings into game assets that I&#8217;ve ever seen. Stories born as mere fragments of ideas were coming to life all around me in a studio full of people who embraced their role as storytellers.Â  It was immensely gratifying.</p>
<p>And then it was gone. The poultice ripped away, a mortal wound left to fester. The grief is very real; this may sound melodramatic to those of you on the outside, but this experience feels much like the death of a dear friend. I&#8217;ve said before that shipping a game after years of work makes you feel like you&#8217;ve been through a war, and the people you fought alongside are the only ones who really know what you&#8217;ve been through. In this case, to work six years on a dream and have it almost come to life, only to lose it suddenly, is a very real psychological trauma. Despite the dozens of articles written on the demise of 38, the only people who really understand are the ones who make up this now fractured fraternity that was once a great team.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been hard to find the time necessary to process it all. As soon as the downward spiral began, we were plunged into a frantic period of resume building, job fairs, phone calls, and unemployment filings. The week of E3 was the first stretch where things got quiet&#8211;disturbingly quiet. For me, not yet having secured a new job, that&#8217;s when the anxiety really took hold.</p>
<p>Even after growing numb to the headlines and news broadcasts, little stings come along with clever ways to hurt me. I still find myself looking at my phone for new email. It used to be that pretty much any hour of the day or night, there was something to read: a bug report, a piece of art to approve, some copy to review, a silly thread on our miscellaneous list, or a NSFW link from a cohort. The absence of that 38 mailbox aches like a phantom limb.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still angry about lots of things (did I mention being screwed out of thousands of dollars?), and I still get so very sad when I think of all that could have been. But mostly I&#8217;ve reached acceptance. Not an acceptance of being at peace&#8211;I don&#8217;t think I can ever be at peace with what happened&#8211;but more an acceptance of resignation, the realization that things are so utterly fucked up as to be completely beyond my control. There&#8217;s simply nothing I can do to save the company, to save the story of Amalur, to recover anything that I&#8217;ve lost. All I can do at this point is to look out for my brothers and sisters, the comrades I&#8217;ve been in the trenches with for all these years. I can try to help them however I can, even as I scramble to find my own landing place. Because if there&#8217;s one truth I&#8217;ve learned over all my years of work, across the many careers I&#8217;ve undertaken, it&#8217;s that the connections you make with good people end up being the greatest treasure.</p>
<p>I have lost something that I deeply loved. I&#8217;m constantly surrounded by reminders of that loss, both in the abstract sense, in stories online and in the media, and by the literal presence of boxes surrounding the desk where I write this post, boxes filled with the books, toys, and bric-a-brac that used to decorate my office at One Empire Plaza. The body doesn&#8217;t feel cold yet, but I have to bury it and move on.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what I must do. I have to let go. That doesn&#8217;t mean the emotions won&#8217;t be there&#8211;those demons will swirl around inside me for a long, long time. But I have to look forward, to restore belief in my talents and abilities, to focus on building a new future. To be sure, it won&#8217;t be the future I planned six years ago&#8211;that dream is gone. But it will be something good, something new to love, something new to believe in. Because I&#8217;ve learned a private truth, a truth I probably tried to deny for a long time: I&#8217;m a person who needs to believe in something bigger than myself.</p>
<p>Despite all the pain, this lesson is a positive I can carry with me for the rest of my days. And that&#8217;s a tangible blessing, a gift to help me smile through the tears.</p>
<p>Goodbye, 38. Goodbye, Amalur. I have loved you more dearly than I can ever say. And I will let you go.</p>
