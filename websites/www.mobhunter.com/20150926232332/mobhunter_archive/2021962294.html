Anytime the little fella gets modified on Test server, casting classes launch into furious debate. This latest change is no exception, as it introduces a new type of spell to Norrath--<a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=3767.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25">Ancient Spells</a>. These include:<p>Master of Death - necro liche form <br>Lifebane - necro lifetap<br>Destruction of Ice - wizard cold-based DD<br>Greater Concussion - wizard aggro reducer<br>Scourge of Nife - shaman DoT<br>Shock of Sun - mage fire-based nuke<br>Burnout V - mage pet buff<br>Eternal Rapture - enchanter stun/hate list wipe<br>Chaotic Visions - enchanter nuke<br>High Priest's Bulwark - cleric self-buff<br>Gift of Aegolism - cleric AoE aego (41 targets!)<br>Legacy of Blades - druid AoE 34 pt. damage shield<br>Starfire of Ro - druid fire nuke<p>You'd think new spells would make casters happy, but of course they seldom do. This batch of spells--on <B>Test server</B>, mind you--inspired at least one mage to announce his retirement and caused several class envy posts between mages and druids. It all goes back to what players think defines their class, and the &quot;grass is always greener&quot; mentality starts to kick in. Not that this phenomenon is unique to casters, of course--melee always think their class should hit harder or have some extra ability that other classes don't. But with so many factors going into what makes a caster useful, there is much more room for disagreement and hard feelings.<p>Good luck with that caster balancing, Verant!<p>On the other hand, necros seem pretty <a href="http://64.29.202.89/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=236">happy</a> with the new spells. Waitaminute... necros... happy? Must be a typo!<p>As to what this new &quot;ancient&quot; spell category means, no one can say quite yet. There seems to be two schools of thought at the moment: one, that these spells will be unique to the Legends server; and two, that these will be ultra-rare drops in Vex Thal or other Luclin ultra-high-end zone. Either way, don't expect to be buying these puppies from a merchant in Qeynos or anything.<p><BIG>Abashi Gets Asked the Worst Question Ever</BIG><p>Gordon Wrinn, known to his loyal minions as Abashi, got <a

href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/r/?domain=&amp;feed=index&amp;page=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/news/news_story.php?id=25135">interviewed</a> recently by Computer and Video Games.com. It's a fairly standard interview, with nothing groundbreaking to report. But it has the distinction of including what is, unequivocally, the <B>stupidest</B> question I've ever heard asked of a Verant employee, proving without a doubt that the interviewer had rarely, if ever, actually played EverQuest. Feast your eyes on this one:<p><B>You have close to half a million people playing the game. Do you ever feel nervous about introducing updates that affect so many people at the same time? Has anything ever gone wrong?</B><p>[begin Samuel L. Jackson voice] HAS ANYTHING EVER GONE WRONG? No, mother#$%^&amp;*, every addition and change to the game has gone as smooth as silk. Nothing bad has ever happened as the result of an expansion or patch. Thanks for asking, you sorry @#$%! [end Samuel L. Jackson voice]<p>I don't know where they got this interviewer, but that question isn't worthy of the editor of a junior-high school paper. Interviews about a game should not insult the intelligence of the player base, thx.<p><BIG>Big Bag of Absor</BIG><p>I tried to make Csenicier post a News Roundup yesterday, but he just couldn't stomach the fact that the only fodder for an article was a group of ho-hum Absor infobits. I couldn't get too mad at him, honestly. Who cares about the stupid <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000487.html">Frostreaver</a>, or more debate on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000465.html">cleric epic quest</a>? I suppose necros would like to read the discussion of what constitutes a <a

href="http://www.ferrago.co.uk/story.asp?id=150">look</a> at the new Star Wars: Galaxies game was certainly newsworthy. SW:G will be set in the time between episodes IV and V (Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back for you non-geeks), and will use a skill-based model rather than a level advancement system. Check out the screenshots in this article--the game looks fantastic.<p>Where are all the &quot;I'll never buy another Verant product&quot; naysayers now? Reserving their copies online, I'll wager.<p><BIG>Maps and Legends</BIG><p>Once again <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com">EQ Atlas</a> comes through with some new maps for your travel pleasure. While Kael and Icewell are pretty well known to most adventurers by now, we're not going to complain about any map that Muse decides to add. They should prove useful to new players especially.<p><BIG>Why Is Mobhunter So Damn Slow?</BIG><p>That's not to say we aren't bright fellas, but our site <I>is</I> pretty slow today. We introduced some new code that needed fine-tuning, and it has resulted in some severe slowdowns. Kohath is going to patch some new files tonight that should make us all zippy for tomorrow.<p>Hmm, kind of sounds like something Verant would say, doesn't it? Maybe we <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3805/when_you_are_ready.html">geeks</a> should stop making fun of patch messages...
