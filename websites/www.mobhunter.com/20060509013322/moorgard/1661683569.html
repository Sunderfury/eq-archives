<html><head><title>A Day of Loss</title></head><body><h1>A Day of Loss</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-02-01</p>Most of us who play EverQuest do so at least in part out of a love of fantasy and science fiction. We like to dream of worlds bigger and grander than our own, filled with heroes exploring new frontiers and discovering wonderful new things.<p>While dragons and starships might not be real, we nonetheless exist today in the presence of true heroes. The men and women who serve NASA and other space programs around the world are pioneers and explorers, united in the purpose of making our lives better by unravelling the mysteries of the stars.<p>A few years ago I visited the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and it was one of the most remarkable places I have ever been. Not just because of the sense of history or the amazing machines you could see, but because of the sense of true fellowship that existed there. Everyone--even tour guides and gift-shop employees--had this feeling of being a part of something bigger than themselves. They talked about &quot;our&quot; missions, &quot;our&quot; astronauts, as if they all realized their part in the great undertaking that is space exploration. The feeling of pride was palpable and inspiring. It's something I will never forget.<p>Tragedies like today's loss make some question the viability of space travel, and whether all the expense is worth it, especially with the current economic situation. But I recall a similar question posed on an episode of <I>Babylon 5,</I> and the words of J. Michael Straczynski ring hauntingly true today:<p>&quot;Ask ten different scientists about the environment, population control, genetics - and you'll get ten different answers. But there's one thing every scientist on the planet agrees on: whether it happens in a hundred years, or a thousand years, or a million years, eventually our sun will grow cold, and go out. When that happens, it won't just take us, it'll take Marilyn Monroe, and Lao-tsu, Einstein, Maruputo, Buddy Holly, Aristophanes - all of this. All of this was for nothing, unless we go to the stars.&quot;<p>The death of the seven astronauts today was tragic, but it was not in vain. Their sacrifice paves the way for the very survival of our species. It isn't a national issue, or a matter of states and flags; the men and women who explore beyond the skies of earth do so for the future of every race and religion. They died so that everything we are can survive, and one day travel to the stars.<p>It's all too easy to take space shuttle flights for granted, especially with all the conflicts and crises that exist in the world these days. But let us never forget that we do live in a time of heroes. And while we lost seven of them today, we must carry on the work that will one day save us all.<p>Here's to the crew of the <I>Columbia.</I> You are truly the stuff of stars.
