				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, it&#8217;s not technically <em>my </em>book per se, but I did coauthor a chapter with my old (and I do mean <em>old</em>) comrade, Tracy &#8220;Owlchick&#8221; Seamster. The book is called <em>Writing for Video Game Genres: From FPS to RPG</em>, and its contributors come from the Writers SIG of the IGDA. Our chapter is, as you might guess, about writing for MMOGs. The rest of the book covers pretty much any type of video game you can imagine.</p>
<p>Obviously the focus is on writing, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about me jamming a bunch of opinionated design theories down your throat (after all, you get those for free on this blog). If for some reason you find this book appealing, you can pad my wallet with a hefty .002 cents per copy royalty by ordering the book directly <a title="Shameless plug." href="http://www.akpeters.com/product.asp?ProdCode=4179" target="_blank">from the publisher</a>, <a title="No shame at all." href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Video-Game-Genres-FPS/dp/1568814178/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1238125481&amp;sr=1-7" target="_blank">via Amazon</a>, or <a title="Seriously, I need money." href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Writing-for-Video-Game-Genres/Wendy-Despain/e/9781568814179/?itm=1" target="_blank">from Barnes &amp; Noble</a>. Word is it may even show up in your local bookstore at some point.</p>
<p>Let me warn you ahead of time that I had to hold back a bit on some of the details I would have otherwise included had my current project been on the shelves already (have to protect the secret sauce, you know), but I think the stuff Tracy and I put together is nonetheless useful for anyone thinking of becoming a writer for an MMOG.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m most proud of the fact that I now have something tangible to show my mom to explain what I do for a living. Video games she doesn&#8217;t get, but a book she will understand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BioWare Austin folks are talking a lot about Star Wars: The Old Republic. And they should, because it&#8217;s without question one of the most anticipated MMOGs on the horizon, thanks in no small part to BioWare&#8217;s reputation for making quality games.</p>
<p>Besides meditating on <a title="The Force was REALLY generous to this one" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/47423" target="_blank">the size of one&#8217;s lightsaber</a>, a major point of emphasis that the devs focus on is the role of the player as hero. For instance, the lead writer discusses <a title="That's a mighty big slug" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/10/24/the-old-republic-unveiled-leveling-sidekicking-and-questing/" target="_blank">making the player feel heroic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daniel Erickson, Lead Writer BioWare Austin:</span> The k&#8217;lor&#8217;slug is 20 feet tall, and horrible, and can eat your face &#8230; and that&#8217;s what you fight at level one as a Sith. The first thing you ever fight in the game is that thing. And you never do anything less heroic than that. There are no bunnies, no rabbits, no snakes &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>A noble goal, that of relieving players of the burden of killing all those tens of rats. This has caused many to consider the role of the hero, including <a title="Link to a lesser blog" href="http://38pitches.com/2008/10/24/mmo-design-and-development/" target="_blank">some folks I happen to know</a>. But while I agree with the general goal of making the player feel heroic, there&#8217;s a lot more to it than just the type of creatures they fight.<span id="more-369"></span></p>
<p>Players feel awesome for a variety of reasons in MMOGs. There is a distinction between making someone feel like a hero, giving them a sense of accomplishment, or making them feel like a badass.</p>
<p><strong>The Hero</strong></p>
<p>Heroes are extraordinary people who do amazing things that the average person can&#8217;t. Traditionally this has been a rather weak area in MMOGs, simply because of the very properties of the game.</p>
<p>A quest giver may beg your character to fight back the orcs that threaten his village, which seems a worthy task for a hero. But sooner or later you realize that if you don&#8217;t fight back the orcs, someone else will. Worse yet, killing a certain number of orcs may complete your quest, but the orcs just respawn and threaten the village again. in order to feel like a hero, the game needs to give consequences for your actions or the lack thereof.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario instead. The village is being overrun by orcs, and if the players don&#8217;t successfully defend the village against incursion over the course of the invasion, the villagers will be driven out and orcs take over. All of a sudden the player&#8217;s choice becomes meaningful; they can see an outcome based upon their actions or inactions, and their world is changed as a result.</p>
<p>Scenarios like this are one-time-use bits of content, and as such are usually regarded as too expensive for MMOG makers to undertake except in rare circumstances. But the games that really want to play up the role of the hero will find ways to make the investment. Without it, heroism in these games will continue to feel shallow.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishments</strong></p>
<p>Making the player feel they accomplished something worthwhile with their time is different than making them feel like a hero, but is just as rewarding. Such moments become even more memorable if the player feels like these goals were set by themselves rather than having them dictated to them.</p>
<p>The run from Freeport to Qeynos is a good example. Nobody gave you a quest at level one to make this journey, but staring at the EverQuest world map inspired many players to make the trip. Those who survived, especially after suffering wrong turns and horrific deaths, had a story they tell with relish to this day.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; achievements like those recently introduced by WoW are cool. But they don&#8217;t compare to the adventures players undertake on their own, for no other reason than to see what happens. Game designers inspire these accomplishments by making a game world with enough depth to allow players to tell their own stories and imagine their own adventures.</p>
<p><strong>Being the Badass</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re serving a greater cause or helping your fellow man. Sometimes you just want to smash stuff in the face.</p>
<p>A surefire way to engage players is to allow them to unleash carnage. Drop them in a room full of zombies with a machine gun (or a katana, or a chainsaw) and let them go to town. Few things feel as gratifying in a video game as mowing through a sea of opponents and coming out the other end bathed in the blood of your fallen enemies.</p>
<p>This feeling can be tied to heroic acts, but doesn&#8217;t have to be. The Harclave buff in EQ2 is a great example of making the player feel like a badass. With that buff, the player cuts a swath through a dungeon teeming with group mobs that don&#8217;t stand a chance. In fact, it&#8217;s just about impossible for the player to die. People played through this Splitpaw dungeon over and over again because it felt so freaking fun.</p>
<p><strong>Balance is Key</strong></p>
<p>Storytelling is about rising and falling action. You can&#8217;t just crank the volume up to eleven and expect to sustain that buzz indefinitely. For the heroic and badass moments to have significance, you also need quieter moments of reflection to consider what you&#8217;ve accomplished.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say you need to give players boring crap to do, but MMOGs are about more than chopping up opponents non-stop. One of the great social elements of EQ was the downtime between fights, which allowed players to bullshit with one another while ramping up for the next encounter. Though EQ took downtime to extremes, the complete lack of it in other games has had a palpable effect upon the way they build lasting communities.</p>
<p>So while the goal of never giving players a less imposing nemesis than a 20-foot slug is cool, that&#8217;s certainly not the only way to inspire feelings of heroism in your player base. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on what made you feel like a hero or a badass, or what kinds of accomplishments you felt most proud of in your MMOG career.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of attention lately has been focused on the quality of writing in MMOs and other games, so I imagine that a number of would-be writers would see this as a great time to jump into the industry. Over on F13&#8217;s game dev board, I <a title="I believe in recycling" href="http://forums.f13.net/index.php?topic=13468.0" target="_blank">responded to a thread</a> started by a poster confused about the term &#8220;narrative designer&#8221; and how that differs from a writer. In the interest of thrift and the desire for relevant blog topics that don&#8217;t have to do with Richard Bartle, I thought I&#8217;d present an updated version of my thoughts here.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. There&#8217;s a huge push right now for telling better stories in MMOs, so naturally most people assume that means hiring really good writers.</p>
<p>But I would point out an important distinction. I think it&#8217;s even more crucial to hire really good <em>storytellers</em>. There&#8217;s a difference.<span id="more-233"></span></p>
<p>Designing for an MMO requires a different kind of storytelling ability from writing a short story, novel, or poem. While you can certainly tell great stories in all three of those forms, they don&#8217;t match up well with MMOs for one reason: they rely solely on written words. The thing everyone knows (but some of those people looking to hire writers haven&#8217;t quite put together) is that an MMO needs to be based around action, not words.</p>
<p>When WoW and EQ2 were in development, it seemed a natural evolution of the MMORPG to emphasize questing. As we all know, questing was actually a fairly minimal aspect of gameplay in EQ and wasn&#8217;t even present in UO. Quests seemed like the universal catch-all that would solve a number of shortcomings in the genre. Quests could be used to give players stuff to do, expose your lore, and serve as a recurring rewards system. Brilliant!</p>
<p>What we didn&#8217;t consider at the time is that quest journals rely upon the written word, and when your character has vowed to rid the world of evil baddies, the last thing you want is to be mired down in words. So what happened? Players speed-clicked through dialogue and quest responses as they raced to the quest accept button.</p>
<p>The thing we forgot is that the earlier generation of games already had a great way to tell (and better yet, inspire) stories. Some of the most memorable moments in MMOs come from witnessing the actions of cool NPCs within amazing environments. Did you need to read a book on Nagafen and the fire giants to appreciate the story that unfolded as you journeyed through the dragon&#8217;s lair? No. Did you need a treatise on the Plane of Fear to understand the relationship of the minions to their god when they called out their obeisance to the will of Cazic-Thule? Nope. That was amazing storytelling using very few words.</p>
<p>Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that great writing skills aren&#8217;t useful on a game team. After all, every designer needs to be able to express his or her thoughts and intent clearly so that the gameplay can be implemented properly. What&#8217;s more, the techniques one learns in writing courses are invaluable in honing the ability to tell a compelling and well-structured tale. But a designer can&#8217;t fall into the trap of relying solely upon words to tell a great story in an MMO, because words only slow players down. The designer should focus on telling a great story using all the tools at his or her disposal, not just the written word.</p>
<p>On EQ2, I worked with a brilliant designer who was only an average writer. But his zones were fantastic, perhaps because he knew he couldn&#8217;t rely upon words to get his intent across. He told great stories using zone population, set dressing, mob abilities, treasure drops, scripted behavior, and more. You understood what was going on by <em>playing </em>through the zone, not by <em>reading </em>about it.</p>
<p>Game design relies upon great storytelling, but the designer has to be able to adapt his or her techniques to the tools that are available.</p>
<p>So despite the pomposity of the term &#8220;narrative designer,&#8221; I think it actually describes the position pretty well. If you want to be a great storyteller in MMOs, becoming a solid writer is the beginning of the journey, not the end of it. Just as a great poet won&#8217;t necessarily make a great novelist, a great prose writer won&#8217;t necessarily make a great MMO storyteller. But in defense of writers, learning those skills in a classroom can&#8217;t hurt.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As anyone who watches TV knows, the Writers Guild of America has been involved in a bit of a strike. That isn&#8217;t stopping them from announcing winners for their annual <a href="http://www.wga.org/awards/awardssub.aspx?id=1516" title="Who doesn't love awards shows?" target="_blank">WGA Awards</a>, although there will be no ceremony held.</p>
<p>For the first time, an award will be given for videogame writing (scroll all the way down to the bottom of the list to see the nominees). GameDaily wonders if this is the first step in recognizing the <a href="http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/feature-video-game-writers-seek-recognition/71369/?biz=1" title="The Biz" target="_blank">growing importance of writing in games</a>.</p>
<p>As someone who earns a living doing this sort of thing, the role of the game writer is a topic that&#8217;s been on my mind a lot lately. There&#8217;s no question that many of the hottest games in recent memory&#8211;from a wide variety of genres&#8211;depend heavily on great writing and storytelling. Titles as varied as Call of Duty 4, Mass Effect, Uncharted: Drake&#8217;s Fortune, and Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction are all extremely cinematic and feature a ton of great writing.</p>
<p>Are MMOs there yet? Not quite. As fun as WoW is to play, it&#8217;s not going to win any awards for its writing. But as the genre grows, I think it&#8217;s inevitable that game makers find a way to meld great stories and writing on top of the style of action MMO players enjoy. The trick, as is true with any kind of writing, is to give your audience the instant gratification they&#8217;re looking for while subtly guiding them into a deeper experience.</p>
<p>Would bringing game writers into the WGA be a good thing? Well, I&#8217;d certainly like to see the actual writers on games receive appropriate compensation and credit for their contributions, but the recent strike illustrates that unionization is a complex issue. Besides all that, the role of writing in games is unique enough that it would be hard to just lump it in with movie, book, or TV writing. For now, I&#8217;d like to see game writing continue to evolve on its own and hopefully find unique ways to address the challenges its facing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes my English degree demands to break free of its geekish bonds.</p>
<p>My coworker Nancy sent me <a target="_blank" href="http://houseoffame.blogspot.com/" title="Someone is a bigger nerd than me, verily">a link to this blog</a> the other day in response to my quoting the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.courses.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/teachslf/gp-par.htm" title="Say it with me now...">opening passages of the Canterbury Tales</a> in Middle English. Back in college, I was required to memorize the first eighteen lines of the general prologue in its original dialect, and as with the Shakespeare passages I have learned, I was determined to retain these bits of lore to impress other nerds at parties.</p>
<p>Anyway, the <a target="_blank" href="http://houseoffame.blogspot.com/2006/06/shes-yonge-shes-sexie-shes-riche.html" title="Please keep Paris in your heart">interview with Paris Hilton</a> is a particular scream if you&#8217;ve ever had to slog your way through Middle English.
