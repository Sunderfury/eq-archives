Most of the player questions have been edited out, but you'll be able to grasp the context, I'm sure.<p><HR allign=center><p><B>Jahaar:</B> As part of this melee balancing patch, I'm looking over the quality of post-epic items and trying to guarantee each class has equal quality weapons available across the board. I'll be looking over the items on Vulak, along with the rest of Temple of Veeshan and I think it's safe to say a few items will be getting some stat changes.<p><B>Rowyl_The_Freak:</B> Yes, with the new UI you will be able to change the graphics for UI elements including the mouse cursor.<p><B>Abashi:</B> We're not planning on including any advantages or disadvantages to gameplay based upon being mounted with possible exception to giving the horse some &quot;mass&quot; from a physics perspective. Adding another balance component of <br>that magnitude (e.g. affecting all of melee) would have made doing horses difficult in the first place. As Brad said earlier, Horses are being included primarily for Travel, and the players desire to futher differentiate themselves<p><B>Absor:</B> Ponies do NOT Mooo.<p><B>Yakatizma:</B> Beastlords are a melee/shaman hybrid with the melee aspect leaning more towards a monk than a warrior. They have some of the special properties of a monk such as an unencumbered armor class bonus, better ac bonus for high agility and are second only to monks in unarmed combat damage.<p><B>Yakatizma:</B> Like a monk they will have to rely on tanks or their pet to soak up a large percentage of the damage that would otherwise be directed at them.<br><B>Yakatizma:</B> In addition to their pet enhancement spells they will also receive some unique non-pet oriented beastlord spells and spells from their Shaman parent class.<br><B>Yakatizma:</B> You can think of them as primitive spiritual warriors with close ties to the wild and the shamanistic cultures they emerge from.<p><B>NOchulus:</B> We are currently addressing some of the problems that casters are having in the higher end encounters as part of our rebalancing on the test server. I really can't elaborate any more on that right now, but we will be releasing more information sometime soon. <p><B>Jahaar:</B> As a class, the warrior is incredibly useful in both group and raid situations, and in fact is often thought of as crucial to making an efficient group. The warrior does have a lot of things going for him now - <br><B>Jahaar:</B> - the highest quality armor, excellent damage output, a large advantage in hit points and actual tanking ability, taunts, stuns &amp; slams, a vast selection of weapons with interesting and useful procs, as well as many useful disciplines.<br><B>Jahaar:</B> We're quite happy with the role a warrior currently plays in EverQuest, happy enough that we used the warrior as a baseline to measure the performance of other classes as we were balancing. With this round of changes, we will be upping the warrior's taunt skill at level 60 to a cap of 230, to help deal with other classes gain in melee damage. <br><B>Jahaar:</B> We'll keep an eye on future changes, to guarantee a warrior always has an important role in the game, but there aren't any immediate class changes we feel are needed to make warriors more effective than they are.<p><B>Matthi:</B> Hail, I have hoping for years that you will implement &quot;chat groups&quot; - where a message will be automatically sent to multiple people - will that be implemented in SoL ?<br><B>Abashi:</B> Not as part of Luclin, but yes, it remains one of the many things that we'd like to do at some point. <p><B>Solist:</B> A few of the old monsters will receive new models, particularly the ones that players can summon or turn into such as skeletons and elementals. Most of the old world critters will remain the same however as there just isn't the time or resources to do that much remodelling.<p><B>NOchulus:</B> Familiars will follow the Wizards around. They do not attack, and can recieve no commands other then /pet get lost. They will zone with the Wizards, and be there waiting for them when they log in (they do not stay in the world when the wizard is gone though)...<br><B>NOchulus:</B> They will grant added resistances to the Wizard, as well as some other benefits that will aid in casting efficiency, as well their mana pool, and mana regen.<br><B>NOchulus:</B> That being said, they currently have not gone through final balancing and are still very much in the process of being worked on.<p><B>Jahaar:</B> We've already made one pass through some high end quests, making the top level Velious quest armor un-sneakable in most cases, as an example. We're likely to go through again to make sure we're happy with the faction <br>requirements of high end quests, and will be keeping that in mind as we develop the Luclin quests.<p><B>Solist:</B> Unfortunately there was an accident in the Akanon clockwork horse manufacturing plant last weekend that resulted in..well...a big mess. Due to this unfortunate turn of events the Gnomish Horse Crafters Union has sadly announced that their people will have to use real horses for the next several years.<br><B>Solist:</B> Sad..but its the truth <br><B>EstertheTester:</B> it was a big mess....<p><B>Yakatizma:</B> You have an item that you can keep in your inventory such as a bridle or whistle or something along those lines that will allow you to summon your horse again should you die or dismiss it, whether or not these will have charges is undecided at this time.<p><B>Jahaar:</B> We're definitely planning to make some accomodation for people with existing characters to choose a face they like when the new character models become available.<p><B>Yakatizma:</B> You can expect to see some unconventional methods of spawning both standard and high-end unique mobs in Luclin. Can't elaborate any further than that or it would spoil the fun.<p><B>Abashi:</B> The new graphics engine doesn't limit the distances we can set the clipping plane out to, at least not in the sense of what you're experienced with. So in general, I expect that you'll have more control over the clipping plane, with exception to cases where we limit how far you can see as purely a gameplay feature.<p><B>Jahaar:</B> Chardok was a dungeon that wasn't seeing as much use as we'd like. People would go there to raid the Royals for epic pieces, and occasionally you'd see a group camping the zone in, but overall it just wasn't getting many people coming in. I've always been impressed with the architecture of the zone, and it seemed like a perfect zone to get a bit of a revamp.<br><B>Jahaar:</B> The amount of roaming mobs has come down quite a bit, things still roam but they don't wander from the very back of the dungeon to the front. You'll find a higher amount of named mobs in the zone, some very interesting new treasures dropping, some quests and conveniences for people with good Sarnak faction, as well as a lot of fun encounters there. <br><B>Jahaar:</B> Another guy on the team, Azaliil, has worked in some incredible story elements and flavor that really make the zone stand out. It's been very well received on test server, and I think people will be really pleased when they get a chance to adventure in new Chardok.<p><B>Makswel:</B> question: any chance of getting a &quot;keychain&quot; or someting with SOL? would be nice to consolidate all of my soul bound keys in one spot. getting a 9th one is a current impossiblity.<br><B>Abashi:</B> We're working on something for that, essentially marking your character as having completed a particular quest and then having doors and such check that flag rather than requiring an item. I hope to see it in by Luclin.<p><HR allign=center><p>Warriors, many of whom felt a little left out in the cold by the proposed upgrades to other melee classes, should be happy indeed. Monks and rogues should be pleased too, because any increase in warrior taunt means a longer lifespan for them.<p>As for beastlords... well, despite Verant's early description of the class as being a hybrid of warrior and shaman, the trickle of info we've gotten on the class has been pointing to them being very monk-like for a while now. This chat is the first real confirmation, however. We monks are used to having our unique characteristics being diluted by other classes, so I guess we can take this news in stride.<p>The keychain idea is long overdue. Now if only they make it apply to non-soulbound keys (like Sleeper's) as well, it would be a real cause for celebration.<p>In any case, this chat gives us even <I>more</I> stuff to drool over--as if we didn't have enough already. Let's hope we see at least a few of these changes go live soon. This upcoming patch would be an excellent opportunity to sneak a few in (*wink wink, nudge nudge*).
