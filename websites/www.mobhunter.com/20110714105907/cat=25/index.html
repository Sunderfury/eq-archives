				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;m in California for the first time in years to attend E3. I haven&#8217;t been to the show since the height of its excess, before it was neutered. Though still manic and bombastic, it feels noticeably less chaotic to me. I have memories (now fond, at the time not so much) of being hoarse each night after trying to shout my demo script for visitors at the SOE booth because I was competing with blaring sound systems from other booths. While communication still requires some effort on the show floor, it seems considerably easier than I remember it.</p>
<p>The show will never again inspire the awe and wonder I experienced the first time I attended, but it&#8217;s cool nonetheless. Activision&#8217;s reveal of the MW3 trailer was a dramatic event that had the crowd breathless in anticipation. Sony and Nintendo hardware had a ton of folks checking it out. Smaller projects drew attention as well&#8211;World of Tanks had an actual tank on display.</p>
<p>The show had its share of underwhelming displays as well, but that&#8217;s to be expected. Overall E3 remains a genuine event, a chance for the games industry to show off a bit in the shadow of Hollywood.</p>
<p>The coolest bit for me was checking out the Reckoning booth and seeing our team demo the RPG. I&#8217;m really excited about players getting to learn more about our world. And seeing the latest trailer playing on EA&#8217;s gigantic booth screen gave me chills.</p>
<p>Guess I&#8217;m just a sucker for the pageantry of it all.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The <a title="The scandal! The infamy!" href="http://ealouse.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/hello-world/" target="_blank">EA Louse blog</a> is all the rage these days, and I&#8217;m sure anyone who visits this site will have encountered many observations on its content already. I can neither confirm nor deny the author&#8217;s assertions, though of course over the years I&#8217;ve heard my share of stories about the dark secrets of various game projects. It&#8217;s a small industry, after all.</p>
<p>This phenomenon&#8211;disgruntled employees <a title="More scandal!" href="http://icefrogtruth.blogspot.com/2010/10/truth.html" target="_blank">venting anonymously</a> for all the world to see&#8211;is hardly new or unique. Any time an MMO or its developer hasn&#8217;t lived up to expectations, someone on the inside has leaked &#8220;the real story.&#8221; You can easily find similar posts by former employees of SOE, Sigil, Cryptic, Origin, and many other dev houses. And of course the fans and watchers of the industry pounce upon these posts and eagerly debate their merits, often with a hearty dose of &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing is, while there&#8217;s a certain amount of irresistible <em>schadenfreude</em> to be gleaned from these tales, one must keep in mind that they&#8217;re often written from a finite perspective. The average employee at a game development house is usually no more privy to the reasons behind the high-level decisions being made than employees in any other industry. There is no shortage of rumors and speculation&#8211;some more rooted in facts than others&#8211;but often enough bits of truth make their way into the mix to seem plausible and even likely.</p>
<p>Assuming that EA Louse believes everything he wrote to be the truth (which is a mighty big assumption to make, but let&#8217;s do so for the sake of argument), that does not mean that everything he wrote is <em>factual</em>. Another person on the same team may agree with some points and disagree with others; that doesn&#8217;t mean this person would be a lair, it just means that their experience and knowledge led them to a different perspective on what the truth is.</p>
<p>Again, I write this post neither to agree nor disagree with EA Louse&#8217;s post. Rather, I write to point out that everyone who posts on the Internet&#8211;me, you, EA Louse, <a title="A rebuttal from Kratos himself" href="http://criminalcrackdown.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-response-to-ea-louse.html" target="_blank">David Jaffe</a>, Perez Hilton, and any other goofball with a blog&#8211;does so from a certain perspective and with some kind of motivation or agenda. We mustn&#8217;t take for granted that truth is an absolute, even if it fills us with delight to believe so (there&#8217;s that old <em>schadenfreude</em> thing again). This is why honest post mortems are so difficult to come by; many of those involved are busy either covering their asses or looking to blame others for mistakes they themselves could have helped to avoid had they put the same degree of passion into fixing problems that they did complaining about them.</p>
<p>No doubt many other perspectives will be forthcoming in the days ahead (some have already been expressed in the copious comments section of the EA Louse blog), but no matter what is said, the objective facts of the situation will probably never be known to the public. Nor should they; even in our gossip-drenched culture, I hope we can collectively realize that it isn&#8217;t our right to know the details of what goes on behind a company&#8217;s closed doors any more than we&#8217;re entitled to know what Brad and Angelina ate for breakfast this morning. The Internet has done funny things to our perspective, to be sure.</p>
<p>That said&#8230; yeah, I got a kick out of reading it, too. I&#8217;m only human, after all.

					<p>I have not given up on blogging, despite all appearances to the contrary. It&#8217;s just that, well, I&#8217;ve been busy.</p>
<p>Lots of great stuff going on at work. As you may have heard, we announced our <a title="There shall be a... oh, you know" href="http://reckoningthegame.com/" target="_blank">first product</a> and have been talking about it at various shows. I know many of you are anxious for more news on the MMO, but our promotional efforts are focused on the RPG right now. All good things to those who wait.</p>
<p>If it counts for anything, I have started (or thought about starting) several articles over the past few months, but never finished writing them for one reason or another. So for your own amusement, please pretend that you read timely, thought-provoking, and highly entertaining posts on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are used video game sales a blight upon the industry?</li>
<li>The subscription MMO isn&#8217;t going anywhere</li>
<li>&#8220;Truth, Lies, and Frogloks: A Cautionary Tale&#8221;</li>
<li>Please buy me an iPad</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one isn&#8217;t really an article; I&#8217;d just love for someone to buy me an iPad.</p>
<p>But honestly, you should really be grateful that you&#8217;re getting a break from my ramblings. You&#8217;ll probably be sick of me again soon enough.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&#8217;ll be <a title="Damn, I am sexy" href="https://www.cmpevents.com/GDAU10/a.asp?option=G&amp;V=3&amp;id=610243" target="_blank">on a panel at GDC Online</a> next month talking about transmedia stories. Looking forward to it!

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Today I, as well as a throng of coworkers, descended upon the first incarnation of PAX East. Though there wasn&#8217;t an official 38 Studios presence (no booth or big announcements this year&#8211;sorry!), our execs were nice enough to give the team the day off to attend opening day of the festivities.</p>
<p>First off, it&#8217;s great to have a major fan-centric gaming event in Boston. The fact that the show sold out for all three days is a testament to how many rabid gamers we have on this side of the country. No question that a show like this was long overdue.</p>
<p>The organizers certainly seemed to have learned a lot from the original PAX in terms of keeping things running smoothly. Though the entrance was a massive choke point (more about this later), once inside things ran like clockwork. It was fast and easy to pick up my badge, and grabbing goodie bags and program guides was a snap. Most of the lower level is a maze-like queue that winds its way toward the second floor, but despite a crowd the line was flowing briskly.</p>
<p>There are some weak points I hope improve next time around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need a better facility &#8211; The Hynes Convention Center is not a great venue. The entryway was a massive bottleneck compared to more modern facilities. The cement floors and drab walls gave off a prison vibe. It just wasn&#8217;t a pleasant place (although easy access to a decent food court is a plus).</li>
<li>Industry support felt tentative &#8211; The expo floor wasn&#8217;t exactly brimming with exciting booths. Local studio Turbine had a nice area, and a few others (like Realtime Worlds, who showed off APB) did as well. But overall it felt like many big-name publishers had little more than a token presence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the show&#8217;s proximity to E3 precluded many companies from committing resources, or maybe they just wanted to see how the first year of the show went. Either way, I hope there is more of a big-name presence next year&#8211;and I hope it takes place in a location that better shows all that Boston has to offer.</p>
<p>Overall the arrival of PAX East is a huge boon to gamers and developers alike. I&#8217;m confident the show will be a huge success and will only get better in the years to come.

					<p>On Tuesday, March 23, I&#8217;ll be speaking at the <a title="i r a brainiac" href="http://conferences.computer.org/vr/2010/" target="_blank">IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 Conference</a>, taking place in nearby Waltham, MA. The panel is titled &#8220;<a title="so outclassed" href="http://conferences.computer.org/vr/2010/program/panels.html#des" target="_blank">Design for Experience?!</a>&#8221; and if you look at the list of speakers, I am clearly the dumbest guy in the room. I can only assume they had some quota of locals that needed to be filled.</p>
<p>My contribution has the uncharacteristically academic title &#8220;Memorable Experiences in Virtual Worlds.&#8221; Don&#8217;t worry&#8211;I&#8217;m not going all Raphtastic on ya. I&#8217;m building upon the basic premise of my talk with Owlchick last year at GDC Austin, where we asserted that the player&#8217;s stories are more compelling than those made by game designers.</p>
<p>Why does this fit a virtual reality conference? The panel is all about designing user experiences, and I submit that currently the most accessible form of virtual reality is found in massively multiplayer online games. Now I just have to convince the audience of that fact.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>The inaugural <a title="Summit up, yo!" href="http://www.gamexpo.us/summit/" target="_blank">GameX Industry Summit</a> last weekend was a great time. Naturally there were a few hiccups&#8211;being the first time the show was held&#8211;but the content of the event was terrific.</p>
<p>A few of my favorite bits were the Saturday afternoon keynote by Chris Foster of Harmonix, a post mortem on cinematics work by Coray Seifert of Kaos Studios, and a talk on the motivations behind acquiring virtual goods by Bernard Yee of CaféMom.com.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the best talk was the panel I was on, moderated by Alexander Macris of  Themis Group and featuring Damon Alberts of  Burst Online Entertainment and Lee Hammock of Fallen Earth. In all seriousness, our varied backgrounds made for a very diverse panel. The similarities in our answers were as interesting as the different perspectives each of us brought to the table. Alexander did a great job moderating and taking input from the audience. The crowd was really engaged and asking some great questions.</p>
<p>I enjoy shows that include a mix of industry and fans, and this summit had a nice balance. I got to meet some cool industry types but also got to hang out with some students and others who&#8217;d like to get into the industry. Hopefully I had some worthwhile advice for a few of them.</p>
<p>I was also surprised by how much activity there was on the expo floor. There were some honest-to-goodness game show booths there for titles like Dante&#8217;s Inferno, as well as online celebrities such as several members of the Guild. There were a lot of people who came just to hang out and play games, which is always neat to see.</p>
<p>The facility and surrounding area were a bit on the dismal side (no places that sold a real cheesesteak close by), so hopefully if the show is a success they can move to a better spot next year. But even as if it stays in the same location, I recommend the event highly. With PAX East debuting next year, the east coast is gaining ground as a major center of gaming.

					<p>Friday I head down to Philadelphia to attend the <a title="My first rated X summit!" href="http://www.gamexpo.us/summit/" target="_blank">GameX Industry Summit</a>. I&#8217;ll be on a panel Saturday at 4pm titled &#8220;<a title="Longest. Title. Ever." href="http://www.gamexpo.us/summit/details.html#right_1024_1600" target="_blank">Beyond Raids and Ganks: Exploring Next-Gen MMOs   in a non WoW-Killer Context</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>What will I be talking about? How to build a WoW killer, of course!</p>
<p>Okay, not really. Here is the panel description:</p>
<blockquote><p>The MMO is here to stay! Having said that, there is an industry push to introduce new paradigms that take the genre beyond the status quo. In what ways can we create MMOs that innovate within the genre, create new player experiences, and develop deeper, more impacting stories, narrations, and character development? This panel brings together developers working on three new MMOs that are pushing boundaries and innovating beyond established concepts. The panelists will discuss the strengths of the MMO format and then break into how they view the MMO developing, through player experiences, new &#8220;success&#8221; metrics, hybridization of genres, targeted gameplay approaches and developments in story and character.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dang. Hopefully they invited me along to lighten things up with my razor-sharp wit.</p>
<p>Anyway, it should be a fun time and I look forward to meeting my fellow panelists. I won&#8217;t know many folks there, so if you happen to be attending please flag me down and say hello. I&#8217;m usually in a much better mood than I appear, so don&#8217;t be afraid!

					<p>From my 10th floor hotel room, it seems like I can see about a thousand miles. Austin is flatter and greener than I expected. Also more humid, which may explain the green.</p>
<p>Our AGDC presentation is at 1:30pm Tuesday. Owlchick and I spent the afternoon polishing the slides (yeah yeah, we were supposed to have the final version done a couple weeks ago) so I think it will go well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to lunch with Hartsman and hope to see other old friends from SOE. Should be a good time.</p>
<p>If the presentation tanks, at least there will be BBQ. Oh yes, there will be BBQ.

					<p>The post on my site that gets the most spam is titled &#8220;<a title="hotness" href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=126" target="_blank">Minnesota MMO Blog Explosion!</a>&#8221; so I figured I&#8217;d make another post with a spammer-friendly title and give the bots a new target.</p>
<p>Anyway, I spent part of my weekend on a panel at the inaugural <a title="Arguably one of the worst designed websites you'll ever see" href="http://www.gameunicon.com/" target="_blank">GameUnicon</a> here in Massachusetts. I was joined by my cohort <a href="http://www.nerfbat.com/">Shwayder</a> and <a title="No, not the BBC chap, although he is British" href="http://elvishparsley.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Justin Webb</a> from <a title="The OTHER MMO developer in Maynard" href="http://www.tencentboston.com/" target="_blank">Tencent Boston</a>. We had an excellent discussion with the seven people in the audience (only one of which was a spouse!).</p>
<p>As proof of our awesomeness at the event, here is a video that Justin and Angela put together.</p>

					<p>Not that the onus for pimping your product ever went away, but it is both terrifying and oddly comforting that the industry is back in &#8220;OMG we must suspend actual development to make our bitchin&#8217; E3 demo!&#8221; mode.</p>
<p>I can say that now from the safety of Maynard, but the dark shadow over my heart tells me that I am destined to one day be a part of it again.</p>
<p>And then there will be screaming. Lots of screaming.
