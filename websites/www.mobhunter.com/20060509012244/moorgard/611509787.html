This is the first *TEST* implementation, which is absolutely subject to change and refinement before it goes live.<p>It doesn't solve everyone's problems about everything, but it does cover most of the important parts:<p>* Multiple casters can land the same spell.<p>* No exploits with zoning/LDing out allowing the same person to stack the same spell multiple times.<p>* While it was fun to watch myself get DoTted to death a few times, we've disabled the ability for NPCs to do this to PCs. (Edit; Clarification: This means that NPCs don't gain the same new stacking abilities that PCs do.)<p>* Due to concerns about seriously imbalancing PvP, the first run will be going in as Player-casting-on-NPC only. <p>* Unfortunately, the 15 effect limit is a totally different beast. It's one we'd like to tackle at some point, but not likely in the short term. Anything that PCs and NPCs have in common is a real bear, as I hope you can imagine.<p>Hopefully there's still enough meat there to where the majority of folks will consider this to be good news.</B><p>If you wade through the flames in the rest of the thread, you'll see that the majority of necros are happy about this change, while some take a &quot;I'll believe it when I see it&quot; stance. That's understandable, I suppose. This doesn't totally balance the necro class, but it would be a start. The biggest boost of all would be the feeling of usefulness that necros would get on raids.<p>I've said it before and I'll say it again: Every player of every class needs to feel wanted and needed in this game. Adding DoT stacking is a means to give a little bit more of that to necros, SKs, and shamans.<p>Even people who cast diseases on others need a hug sometimes.<p><BIG>Wizards and Trolls</BIG><p>Absor stopped over at Graffe's Wizard board to respond to a troll post from an apparently unhappy necro who was <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=19607.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20">complaining</a> that Verant is deliberately shafting people by not including certain NPCs in the global file that defines what models (besides players) can be seen in every zone:<p><B>Untrue. Completely false.<p>We don't add more models to the global file because it's full. Period. We squeeze some in here and there, often after we manage to make a major breakthrough in space saving magic. And we like to leave a little room for expansion.<p>Be careful with your quotes. We've never said anything even remotely like that.</B><p>Way to bring it, Alan! He later added:<p><B>Given unlimited resources (ours and yours), there would be a LOT of things in that global file. We certainly understand the concern. Right now there is no answer. Maybe one of the guys will find a way to squish up the graphics a bit and we'll gain some space, who knows.<p>I didn't mean to sound upset, but I suppose after a while a person can only see so many mis-statements like that...<p>/em shrug.</B><p>What Absor wanted to add after the ellipsis was &quot;before I lay the smack down on your punk ass!&quot;<p>Come on, Alan. You know you want to.<p><BIG>Maps &amp; Legends</BIG><p>SOE gets a lot of money from me. I've subscribed to EverQuest for over three years and bought every expansion along the way, as well as a comic book, action figures, and admission to a FanFaire. That $80 t-shirt is still the most expensive I own.<p>Now those evil bastards are coming up with more ways to soak us poor addicted freaks. The EQ Live site has just announced the upcoming <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/eqatlas/atlas.jsp">EverQuest Atlas</a> book.<p>You can check out a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/eqatlas/Everfrost_Peaks.pdf">sample</a> of Everfrost Peaks. The map is nice, though it's more a stylized painting than an accurate map, leaving out many of the zone's details. Of greater interest to the EQ fan is the text, which gives some background lore on the zone that would appeal to those of us who hopelessly cling to the notion of a congruous backstory to the world of Norrath.<p>Perhaps the text goes a bit too far into the roleplay aspects of the barbarian race it talks about, as illustrated by the following fragment: <I>Goblins, snow orcs, and giants alike continue live in the north.</I> Or maybe Verant needs to hire a better proofreader.<p>So what's the deal with them not using maps that are already established and more detailed--such as those provided by <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">EQ Atlas</a>? Maybe SOE didn't want to make a spoiler book... or maybe they just didn't want to pay to use Muse's maps again. In any case, this book will appeal more to fans who want extra background on the world of Norrath rather than those who want to find where a certain earring drops in CT.<p>The other big thing for your Christmas list is due November 5. It's EverQuest Gold, yet another bundling of the game which includes the following:<p><B>This ultimate collector's edition is perfect for both new EverQuest players and serious EverQuest veterans. It includes EverQuest and the first four EverQuest expansions: Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, Shadows of Luclin, and Planes of Power. Also included are a leatherette bound manual and new user strategy guide, a premium collector's edition pewter figurine, a DC EverQuest comic (only available in this box), and four exclusive cloth maps of the world of Norrath. Everything is contained within a beautiful metal tin. Each tin is numbered, one of a limited production run of only 35,000 units.</B><p>At around $60 to $70, you'll have to decide for yourself whether this set is worth the cash or if it's just a scam. Clearly this isn't aimed for the first-time player, but is targetted at the die-hard addict... er, fan.<p>Anyway, if you feel so inclined, here are some links through which you can preorder this stuff and help support Mobhunter a bit. We get like a dollar for each thing you buy or something.<p><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000069K5R/mobhunter-20">EverQuest Atlas Book</A> from Amazon<br><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Vl3zxmvxXTM&amp;offerid=13850.224426&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" >EverQuest Atlas Book</a> from EB Games<p><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000069K5T/mobhunter-20">EverQuest Gold</A> from Amazon<br><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=Vl3zxmvxXTM&amp;offerid=13850.224427&amp;type=2&amp;subid=0" >EverQuest Gold</a> from EB Games<p><BIG>Random Bug of the Day</BIG><p>Has anyone else found their profanity filter got turned on after the last patch and they can't turn it off? Not that I sit and curse all day, but it's rather annoying to read guildchat and have to guess at which dirty word someone used to describe Verant. Using the /filter badword toggle doesn't help.<p>I want my rsntnsw curses to work, xpuv it!
