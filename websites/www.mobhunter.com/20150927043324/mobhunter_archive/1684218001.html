<html><head><title>First Days in the Planes</title></head><body><h1>First Days in the Planes</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-10-23</p><BIG>Home, Home in the Planes</BIG><p>Like many of you, I went out yesterday to pick up my Planes of Power CD. As I wasn't a lucky Walmart shopper and Verant doesn't send me free copies of their software, I had to wait like most everyone else to see PoP. So it was with great anticipation that I came home yesterday afternoon, only to find the servers down. Figures. Shadows of Luclin--literally, shadows of Luclin's horrendous blunder of a release--brought a lump to my throat.<p>Thankfully, the servers were only down a few hours, and then my venture to the planes could begin. Like most people, I was impressed by the Plane of Knowledge, and the transportation system is wonderful. Tranquility (which has already gained the unfortunate hippy moniker of PoT) is gorgeous, with well-designed entrance areas to the other planes. My first foray was into the Plane of Disease, which is as creepy and gross as we could have hoped. The whole sky seems to be teeming with bacteria--a very nice touch. Not to mention bones and giant poo and thick black hairs that stand on end. Plane of Justice has a dark sense of foreboding, and seems to have a lot of <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm16.showMessage?topicID=429.topic">triggered events</a> that might prove interesting.<p>Of course, the servers were brought down again last night for an emergency patch, the result of which is:<p><B>- Fixed a number of bugs associated with the new sound system.  If you were having troubles yesterday and disabled sound and music, please feel free to give it another try today.<p>- NPC sounds should no longer clip out too fast.<p>- The Sound Realism slider in the Options window is once again working.  Turning it all the way off will disable Reverb, as the old /reverb command used to.<p>- Quieted down people's personal sounds (sounds that you hear yourself making) a few notches.  <p>- In minor updates throughout yesterday, also addressed a number of spells whose effects were no longer making their usual noises.<p>- Assorted content tweaks.</B><p>Sounds were a bit screwy, causing quite a few people to crash to desktop at regular intervals, so hopefully the patch helped with that. Aside from these minor downtimes, PoP's launch has gone much more smoothly than Luclin's. Remember, nearly everyone was unable to even <I>play</I> SoL for a few days after its release. The planes were accessible already on Monday.<p>The raid system (which, as Absor <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52385">reminded us</a>, is a feature of PoP and not something free to everyone) is very, very cool, though anyone hoping to see huge exp gains from it is bound to be disappointed. I dinged to 61 on my first raid kill, but many NPCs later I could see no visible gain in my exp bar (and yes, I had 100% going to regular exp). Even vocal Verant critics like FoH's Furor are <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/flash/index.php">praising the expansion</a> in general and this feature in particular:<p><b>First, I must say, this was the smoothest rollout of an expansion Verant has had to date.<p>Aside from a few minor bugs, which will be resolved, the entire thing, start to finish, was dead on. Now, I'm SURE something will come up, but shit, no complaints so far.<p>Now, let me tell you, the /raid feature was enough for me to pay $30 for this expansion. I've been waiting for this damn thing for YEARS! Those that know me, know I'm anal about groups, and this damn thing is like the pocket protector I never had. Praise Jesus is all I can say. There are some minor issues with the feature that I'm hoping will be worked out, but aside from that, it kicks ass.</b><p>What a freaking VAK.<p>Many people have <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=25567.topic">expressed concerns</a> that levelling post-60 will be as bad as 59 used to be, despite Verant's assurances to the contrary. This is especially bothersome because some previously useful exp spots in 60 (like the top floor in Sebilis) basically green out as soon as you ding. Still, there were already level 62 people running around yesterday, so it can't be all that bad. I hope.<p>The new system for acquiring spells is pretty interesting. Generic nodrop scrolls that drop around in the planes can be traded in by any caster to receive spells for their class. These scrolls seem rather rare, though, and I can imagine that dividing them up on raids will be difficult. Every caster wants spells, naturally.<p>Plane of Knowledge is packed with NPCs, many of which offer <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovequests.showMessage?topicID=5487.topic">exceedingly long quest text</a>, while others say hardly a peep. Of course, some of them will probably get more talkative once you've accomplished some things in the planes, at least according to Verant's previous patch message.<p>One kind of neat feature is that some NPCs will give you semi-precious gems <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=5745.topic">in exchange for your old planar armor</a>. Truth be told, I'm a bit let down by this. I had been keeping some pieces of shiverback armor in the bank in the hopes that it would be useful in some PoP quest. Like maybe you could trade in your old planar armor plus some PoP drops for a new, class-specific armor that was actually useful. Sadly, it seems all I'll be getting is some gems I could buy in the Bazaar. Oh well, more bank space, at least.<p><a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=78678">Enchanter pets</a> were overpowered for a while, and mages <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=7455.topic">debated the fact</a> that their level 61 pet doesn't seem as hardy as their epic companion. Pet ownership continues to have its ups and downs.<p>Most folks are still in the information-gathering phase of PoP, and it's hard to separate facts from assumptions sometimes. Personally, I plan to play around in it as much as I can and figure out the score for myself. Overall, the new zones look great and the expansion has a far greater feeling of completeness than Luclin did--or does. Whether that sense will still hold true once people see the deeper planes, of course, remains to be seen. But for now, PoP gets a thumbs up. Just make sure you <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52416">install it in the right directory</a> and have yourself a good time.<p>Oh, and that figurine of FiVi is hot. Rowwwrrrr!<p><BIG>Atlas Shru--Oh, Forget It</BIG><p>Wouldn't you know it, those crafty salesmen at Software Etc. had the <I>EverQuest Atlas</I> book sitting right there on the counter, and naturally I had to pick the thing up. I'm only up to the &quot;C&quot; section so far, but I'm enjoying it a lot. I think the title is somewhat misleading, as the maps are far from detailed, but the zone descriptions and game lore are pretty cool. Perhaps <I>The EverQuest Travel Planner</I> would have been a more appropriate title.<p>Unfortunately, the book has multiple errors and could have benefitted greatly from the touch of a good editor (cough!), but I think anyone interested in the story behind the game would find this a worthwhile purchase. Hey, I might even be able to figure out what the whole Luclin expansion was supposed to be about... maybe.<p>In actual map news, Muse over at EQ Atlas says he won't have any planar maps for a while. It seems he isn't in Verant's good graces these days; perhaps they didn't want him to have access to the PoP beta to avoid competition with their own book. Anyway, there are already <a href="http://www.nothing-inc.com/~sparr/pop/">PoP maps</a> popping up, and more will be on the way, I'm sure. But as a fan of Muse's work, I think it's too bad that we won't be seeing anything from him for a while.<p><BIG>Across the Pond</BIG><p>We got word from GM Saryahn of Ubi Soft's Euro team on a few facts that should please non-US EverQuest junkies:<p><B>- The beta test for EverQuest's European versions has started on Monday the 21st<p>- Good news for European customers and people in the world that speak French and German: all EverQuest versions will be compatible each other. This means that a US player, who bought his EQ copies in USA, and pays his account to SOE, can play on Ubi's servers. Also, a European player that bought all his EverQuest copies from UbiSoft, can play on any server, SOE's or Ubi's. The only thing is that if you are logged, or the last time you played you were logged, on a server (say English speaking) and want to play on a server that runs EQ in another language, you have to repatch your EQ client so it matches with the server's version. And that's it.<br> <br>As a reminder, Ubi's servers will provide at least 1 GM 24/7 (up to 4 in peak hours) per server, an average of 4 GM-run events per week, and the possiblity for European people to pay in Euro or with national credit card (international credit card was mandatory to play EQ by the past, since SOE is an US company). Note that all these features will be targeted for European time zone (GMT/GMT+1).</B><p>This decision is a good one on the part of Ubi Soft and Verant. European players won't feel forced to play on specific servers, while they will be free to explore localized ones if they so choose. It would be a great move if Verant allowed free server transfers to at least some of the Euro servers. Maybe a few of those non-US guilds with unfair access to ubermob spawns would be happier on their own servers. I know plenty of US players who would like that.<p><BIG>Dressing Up, Dressing Up</BIG><p>Woody over at GU Comics sent us news of a little contest he's running:<p><B>1st Annual GU Costume Contest<p>That's right...

I'm a shoe-in to win with my outfit, which I like to call &quot;female dark elf bondage girl.&quot; Which reminds me, I need to go restock my supply of blue body paint.<p><BIG>Monkeybone</BIG><p>Monday's big patch offered up a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52378">fix to feign death</a> that monks, SKs, and necros should be pleased about. There were always certain &quot;aggressive&quot; NPCs that wouldn't believe FD even when it was successful, and supposedly now they will.<p>Top on the list of non-FD believers is the Avatar of War--at least when he has other folks on his hate list. Maybe he'll be a bit more forgiving now.<p><BIG>I'm Telling You for the Last Time</BIG><p>Just in case anyone still had any doubts on the matter, Verant has once again stated for the record that <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/032550.html">EQ Windows is illegal</a>:<p><B>Yes, EQW is a bannable offense, according to the EULA.<br>I hope you understand that when people ask this questions, some see it as an opportunity to open up the debate. However, no debate exists, since this issue is not open for discussion. Therefore, I am locking the thread, since the question has been answered.<p>Regards,<br>Victor Wachter<br>Sony Online Entertainment</B><p>In other words, anyone who uses EQW shouldn't be talking about doing so in game, because any channel you use can be monitored. For the record, we don't see the harm in using it either, but it's SOE's game and they have to defend their copyright however they see fit.<p>Okay, that's enough news for you today. Leave me alone and let me have some fun in the planes, will ya?<br>
