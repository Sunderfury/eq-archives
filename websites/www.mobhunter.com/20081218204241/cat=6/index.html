					<p>It saddened me not a little this week to read that <a title="A piece of history" href="http://www.startrekexp.com/" target="_blank">Star Trek the Experience</a>, a museum/theme ride that has been in the Las Vegas Hilton for over a decade, <a title="Boldly going into retirement" href="http://trekmovie.com/2008/06/29/star-trek-the-experience-closing-in-september/" target="_blank">will be closing this September</a>.</p>
<p>I am sorry to see it go, not only because I am a lifelong Trek fan (however dated some of the multimedia stuff was, the collection of memorabilia was first rate) but because of the countless Fanfaire memories forever associated with the place. I&#8217;ve attended many SOE gatherings at the Hilton, and Quark&#8217;s Bar was always the epicenter where fans and devs could hang out together. Many a <a title="Don't believe what the page says--one person can drink this!" href="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Warp_core_breach_(beverage)" target="_blank">Warp Core Breach</a> has been consumed while discussing the latest patch or sharing war stories of a raid gone wrong.</p>
<p>There are hints that the Experience may be reopened elsewhere. Certainly if the <a title="Click the red dot for some kind of ARG" href="http://www.startrekmovie.com/" target="_blank">franchise relaunch film</a> is a hit, you can expect to see all kinds of updated Trek in the media. But for us diehards, the original STE will be remembered fondly as a Mecca to which we could make our nerd pilgrimage, a place where we could share our fandom and not feel so alone in the galaxy. It was a place of hope and dreams, and we need more of those in this life, not fewer of them.</p>

					<p>Thankfully, David Cook won American Idol. After last night&#8217;s all-out performance by Archie, I was resigned to seeing the younger David winning the year. Perhaps Simon&#8217;s harsh comments actually motivated more viewers to come out on behalf of Mr. Cook. In any case, the right man won.</p>
<p>When I saw the finale was going to be two hours long, I had no intention of watching anything except the last 15 minutes. Of course, I ended up watching the whole thing, and it was actually enjoyable. It was nice to see members of the top twelve who hadn&#8217;t been around in a while, and most of the &#8220;star&#8221; appearances were tasteful.</p>
<p>But come on, be honest: Does anyone actually think that Mike Myers movie looks at all funny? The trailers are painful to watch.</p>
<p>That aside, tonight was the culmination of a good season. I&#8217;ll be back next year.</p>
<p>Now the summer season starts with tomorrow night&#8217;s kickoff of So You Think You Can Dance, which is actually one of my favorite reality shows.</p>
<p>Yeah, I watch too much TV. Hope my copy of Age of Conan gets here soon.</p>

					<p>So yeah, I watch American Idol. The show is funny at the start of the season, and you end up getting wrapped up in how the contestants do each week. Top 40 isn&#8217;t my thing, but you have to admire the talent of a lot of these people.</p>
<p>That said, the show is just a TV show to me. I haven&#8217;t bought any Kelly Clarkson or Clay Aiken records (honest!), and I pretty much forget who was on previous seasons. But for the first time, there are people on the show this season whose albums I would actually buy: Jason Castro, David Cook, and Brooke White.</p>
<p>Castro has the exact kind of voice and manner I usually buy, so as long as he holds to a singer-songwriter vibe I&#8217;m there. Cook is ready to be a rock star <em>right now</em>, and as long as he doesn&#8217;t get saddled with some 100-year-old producer who tries to drag him into pop hell he should make a great record. And Brooke&#8217;s voice is just startlingly beautiful; she could sing the instruction manual for a cake decorating kit and put tears in your eyes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already bought a few songs via their in-studio iTunes performances: Castro&#8217;s &#8220;Somewhere Over the Rainbow,&#8221; Cook&#8217;s &#8220;Billie Jean&#8221; and &#8220;Eleanor Rigby,&#8221; and Brooke&#8217;s &#8220;Jolene.&#8221; That cross-marketing thing has to be a goldmine for them.</p>
<p>In other TV news, Hell&#8217;s Kitchen continues to be the best thing ever. I try to model my management style after Gordon Ramsay, as Shwayder will attest.</p>

					<p>It was a war that never should have happened: two competing standards for the high definition media crown. In one corner, HD DVD, the format backed largely by Toshiba which could have won based solely on its logical name (people know what HD is, and they know what a DVD is&#8230; a no-brainer). In the other corner, Blu-ray Disc, the oddly named format championed by Sony.</p>
<p>For a while there, it looked like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotape_format_war" title="Kids in school right now will never know what a video tape was." target="_blank">VHS vs. Betamax battle</a> all over again. Stores were stocking both formats, confusing customers and causing most of them to stick with the familiar DVD. Add in the fact that you needed an HDTV to even care, as well as the introduction of &#8220;upconverting&#8221; players which made regular DVDs look great on high-def TVs for far less money than either of the new formats, and you had a recipe for a technology meltdown. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=197#more-197" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>Well, at least the premiere episode was watchable.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I was mostly looking forward to this show because it features <em>Firefly/Serenity</em>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1132359/" title="So, so hot" target="_blank">Summer Glau</a> as the latest female terminatrix, but I also hoped it wouldn&#8217;t totally ruin a good franchise. (No, I didn&#8217;t think <em>Rise of the Machines</em> sucked. Plus, the next movie is going to star Christian Bale.)</p>
<p>The time travel thing was a bit odd, but at least it was handled decently. Battling killer robots may be rough, but I think John Connor&#8217;s toughest challenge will be overcoming the psychological impact of seeing his hot mom naked. I hope the female terminator is programmed to administer therapy.</p>

					<p>Yeah, I know it&#8217;s a shock. I tuned in last night to the new ABC sitcom <em><a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/cavemen/index" title="They know how to make fire." target="_blank">Cavemen</a> </em>under the assumption that it was going to be a train wreck.</p>
<p>It was actually pretty funny; I laughed out loud in parts. And hey, it featured a Wii in a couple scenes, which was cool. While Neanderthals are the primary characters (delivered in the same put-upon style as the Geico ads), it also featured that blonde dude from <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456554/" title="Required viewing for game devs." target="_blank">Grandma&#8217;s Boy</a></em> as a human sidekick. Anyway, it&#8217;s worth watching.</p>
<p>In other fall TV news, so far NBC&#8217;s new shows are the winners in my book. <em>Chuck </em>is the show I like best, with a good mix of comedy and over-the-top action. I had high hopes for <em>Bionic Woman</em>, but the premiere left me with mixed feelings&#8211;parts of its premise are paper thin. I&#8217;ve also enjoyed <em>Journeyman</em>, mostly for the actors involved.</p>
<p>I recorded <em>Dirty Sexy Money</em> because I like Peter Krause a lot, but I haven&#8217;t watched it yet. On the reality front, <em>Kitchen Nightmares</em> is the only new (yeah, I know there&#8217;s a British version) show I&#8217;m watching, because I can&#8217;t get enough of Gordon screaming at people.</p>

					<p>In addition to <em>300</em>, the home video release I was most looking forwardÂ to last week was a new taste of the <em>Babylon 5</em> universe. The first of what creator J. Michael Straczynski hopes to be a series of direct-to-DVD releases called <em>The Lost Tales</em>, the debut disc is titled &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/118.html#leap" title="My favorite B5 site">Voices in the Dark</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the first B5 release centered on the original cast since the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/countries/us/guide/110.html" title="I cried like a baby.">series ended</a> nearly nine years ago, I was thrilled. <em>Babylon 5</em> had a huge impact on my life; not only did I find it immensely moving andÂ entertaining, but it taught me a lot about how to tell stories. In fact, at my current job I regularly use B5 as an example of how to introduce an interesting plot twist or move the story in an unusual way. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, JMS is a master storyteller, a fact made clear by his run writing <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> and other comics.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a true fan, of both the B5 universe and JMS himself. That&#8217;s why writing this post is so disheartening.</p>
