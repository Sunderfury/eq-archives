<html><head><title>Planes of Power Announced</title></head><body><h1>Planes of Power Announced</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-03-22</p>The official press release, straight from the arms of Sony Online Entertainment:<p><B>The launch of EverQuest&reg; in March 1999 changed the world of massively multiplayer online gaming forever.  Since then we have brought you a new playable race of lizard men called the Iksar in EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark(TM), ancient enemies and new adventures on the frozen continent of Velious in EverQuest: The Scars of Velious(TM), and a completely graphically overhauled world, the enchanting moonscape of Luclin, mounts, and a new playable race of noble cat people, the Vah Shir, in EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin(TM).  Now players will soon be able to access the most powerful deities in all of Norrath.  We are pleased to announce the next installment in the best-selling, critically acclaimed EverQuest series, EverQuest: The Planes of Power(TM).  <p>An arcing storyline takes players on an epic adventure through the Planes of Power, home of the Gods of Norrath. Veteran players will face new challenges in each of the 18 newly discovered planes. Players of all levels will benefit from the Plane of Knowledge that hosts scores of new quests and opens portals to Norrath making travel easier than ever. Hundreds of new items, quests and encounters will keep even the most revered players challenged and enthralled. <p>Battle the minions of Rallos Zek in the Plane of War; help Karana regain control of the Plane of Storms; overcome vile pestilence in the Plane of Disease!<p>You're in their worlds now!<p>EverQuest: The Planes of Power Features List:<br>- 18 new planar zones that push your teamwork abilities to the limit<br>- Hundreds of new items and monsters<br>- Exciting new quests and challenges await even the most experienced players<br>- Two planar cities that provide a hub for travel and player interaction <br>- A central storyline links the content from every zone into one compelling quest.<br>- Further character progression making players even more powerful</B><p>Also courtesy of SOE, here are some screenshots:<p><table><tr><td><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/wrinnfly6.jpg"><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/wrinnfly6-small.jpg" border="0"></a></td><td><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/lujein2.jpg"><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/lujein2-small.jpg" border="0"></a></td></tr></table><p>Admittedly, a press release and some very early screens aren't a lot to go on, but this expansion sounds very impressive so far. Rather than just being about killing stuff randomly, we're actually promised <I>a central storyline</I> here. What's the &quot;one compelling quest,&quot; you ask? We don't know any more than you do, but we gotta admit that we're already hooked.<p>You also need to go to the official <a href="http://www.planesofpower.com/">Planes of Power</a> Web site, which is now updated for your viewing pleasure. There's info on some of the planes, as well as a worthwhile tidbit or two in the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/FAQ.jsp">FAQ</a>:<p><B>Like EverQuest: The Scars of Velious, will I need a level 35 character or above to play the game?<p>The Plane of Knowledge will be available to players of all levels and will be a source of many new quests, making travel throughout Norrath far more convenient. All other new planar zones will require players to be level 46 or above to enter.</B> <p>Also of note is a new <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/interviews/march02/humblerod/index.shtm">interview</a> over at Gamespy with <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,373/">Rod Humble</a>, executive producer of the project. Some notable quotes:<p><B>GameSpy: You claim that the Plane of Knowledge will make travel around Norrath easier. How so? <p><I>Rod Humble: Many lands will be able to access the Plane of Knowledge easily, and portals will be two-way. Of course, creatures of all kinds can use portals, not all of them may have benevolent reasons... </I><br>...<br>GameSpy: It seemed as though many players had to substantially upgrade their computers to use Luclin. Do you expect to see this happen again with The Planes of Power? <p><I>Rod Humble: No, we do not. In fact, since the launch of Luclin we have introduced a series of patches that reduced Luclin's system requirements. </I><br>...<br>GameSpy: Does this expansion up the level cap from 60 to 70? If not, why not? <p><I>Rod Humble: We are not yet able to discuss what level increases will occur in The Planes of Power, but stay tuned for further announcements. </I><br>...<br>GameSpy: Is this the last expansion pack we can expect for some time? <p><I>Rod Humble: The world of Norrath will continue to grow in the years to come. We have not yet finalized any plans yet, although we have plenty of ideas.</I><br> <br>GameSpy: Can you comment about any other future EverQuest projects? EverQuest 2 or maybe a console version of EverQuest, for example? <p><I>Rod Humble: Not just yet. </I><br>...<br>GameSpy: Do you think EverQuest will ever end? <p><I>Rod Humble: Certainly we have no plan on ending it.</I></B><p>Of course those last bits don't have anything to do with PoP per se, but we found them interesting anyway. If Verant keeps rolling out the expansions and finds innovative ways to keep players interested, there may not be a need for EverQuest 2. As ever, numbers and dollars will determine that. <p>Two planar cities... easier travel... 18 zones... new trade skills... it's enough to make us warm and tingly all over. Of course, phrases like &quot;Further character progression making players even more powerful&quot; tend to put us on our guard. I mean, with the AAXP abilities of Luclin, melee balancing, and caster balancing, how much more powerful do players need to be? Don't get me wrong--I'd love player <I>advancement</I> in the form of new skill trees, greater customization, etc. But giving a warrior more hitpoints or a wizard bigger nukes would be counterproductive in the long run. And for the love of whatever gods inhabit these planes... <B>Do not raise the level cap!</B> I shouldn't have to say that. Verant must know it already... they have to. <I>/huddles into a little ball and mutters to himself over and over</I><p>But honestly, today isn't the day to get too worked up about potential problems or being scared of what might be. Today is the day we read the press release, drink in the screenshots, and say &quot;Wow... cool!&quot;<p>That's what we're doing, anyway.
