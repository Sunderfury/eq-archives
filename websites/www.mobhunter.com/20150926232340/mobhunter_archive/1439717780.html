This time Verant was wondering what you'd like their focus to be:<p><B>Once Planes of Power is released, what would you prefer to see happen in EverQuest?<p>- No opinion/do not count my answer.<p>- Enhancing, Extending, Tuning, and Fixing existing features and content. (e.g. Gameplay, Abilities, Zone Revamps, Animations)<p>- Adding new features and content. (e.g. New Zones, Character Shadows)</B><p>There is quite a bit of <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=21229.topic">discussion</a> around the message boards about this. The majority of people speaking up voted for the second option, as did I. There are many existing bugs and lots of incomplete content that we'd love to see addressed, and many people feel that the Dev Team is always under pressure to create shiny new things rather than fix what is broken.<p>But don't get your hopes up. Even if 90% of those responding vote for existing content to be tuned, remember that Verant is only asking for your <I>opinion,</I> not making any guarantees. Maybe the team wants some data with which to go to the higher-ups and say, &quot;Look, our customers really want us to focus on existing content, and we'd like to be able to spend more time doing that.&quot;<p>From a monetary standpoint, the suits at SOE probably only get excited by new content. Why? Because that's what sells. New content lets them put out press releases, get coverage on gaming Web sites, and get mentioned in magazines. Fixing older content may be great for existing users, but it doesn't sound sexy. Suits know how to sell new stuff; they don't know how to market a statement like &quot;Well, today we retuned Plane of Sky quests and fixed the pathing in Ssra basement.&quot;<p>Some people believe that Verant should be doing both things--fixing old stuff and giving us new content. I'm sure whatever the outcome of this vote, it's not going to slow down future expansions one bit. But believe it or not, Verant does have finite resources, so asking for our opinion on where to focus those is a good thing.<p>In my book, if the choice is between adding half a dozen new zones like Jaggedpine and the Warrens or retuning zones a la CT and fixing bugs, I'll take the latter every time. Hey, I'd love to see character shadows as much as the next guy, but I'd like to see improved animations for the Luclin models even more. And as for new zones, well, there are plenty of existing zones in the game now, and even more later this month when Planes of Power is here. Make places like Veeshan's Peak and Inner Acrylia worth going to and players will be a lot more content with what we have now.<p>And, um, don't forget about that /camp desktop thing, k?<p><BIG>Be All that You Can Planarly Be</BIG><p>Looks like a few <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=21254.topic">new planar skills</a> have crept into testing, including a couple goodies for casters and a new trick or two for warriors. Casters Realm put together <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4797">a list</a> of the recent additions.<p>Anything that promises to up their direct damage output makes wizards drool, of course, but warriors are <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=2140.topic">still waiting</a> for planar skills that don't sound like party toys. Tradeskillers will be pleased (I think) to find that they will be able to raise more than one skill past 200 via New Tanaan Crafting Mastery. Or, maybe they'll just go insane.<p>The addition of these skills shows that the Planar Advancement system is still a work in progress. We're hopeful that some more creative additions will surface (the tradeskill thing is a good start) before the October 22 release.<p><BIG>I Want Your Hands on Me</BIG><p>Besides Absor's post on Dev Corner acknowledging that beastlord warders, Lay on Hands, and Spell Casting Mastery <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=51937">aren't working</a>, Scott Hartsman stopped by the paladin board to give his <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=16717.topic">personal assurance</a> that the bug will be fixed. I'd quote it, but EZ Board seems to be taking a dirt nap at the moment (what's new, right?), so just use your imagination.<p>On the other side of the good/evil coin, shadowknights got word from Absor on an issue with their Soul Abrasion skill <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=16717.topic">interfering with crits</a> on Shroud of Death via the Spell Casting Fury skill:<p><B>We've changed the way these two abilities work. After the next patch Spell Casting Fury will be checked first. If it fails and there is no critical, then Soul Abrasion will take effect. They won't stack, and they really shouldn't, but one or the other will work.</B><p>Shadowknights are <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=76667da34aa0a1a1dc786b68351f9b8d&amp;threadid=6289">confused and angry</a> about this announcement. They feel that after all the AA points spent to acquire these skills, stacking for a larger crit would not be unbalancing. What's more, they were told a few months ago by Rich Waters that the two skills not stacking was a <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2932">known bug</a> which would be fixed.<p>Like most hybrids, SKs are a tough balancing act. They have a lot of strengths, but some pretty glaring weaknesses, especially in the raid game. We'll keep our fingers crossed that the gods (or demons, or whatever) will smile down on the SKs and fix this and other issues.<p><BIG>Ah, <I>There</I> You Are!</BIG><p>The quest for my missing hitpoints may have finally come to its sad end. Others who have suffered a similar loss were lamenting their plight at the Safehouse, and a theory was posted that might <a href="http://pub117.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=25326.topic">offer an explanation</a> as to what happened:<p><B>They changed the way PE stacked with ND, as people have mentioned above.<p>My base unequiped HP is 1505 (rogue, with 75 stam).<p>Before the patch, I had 1688 (1505 * 1.1 from ND3 * 1.02 from PE).<p>Now, I have 1685 (1505 * (1 + (0.1 from ND3 + 0.02 from PE))).<p>Basically, PE used to multiply on top of ND, now it's added to ND before multiplying with HP.<p>Considering nearly all &quot;stacking math&quot; in EQ works by adding multipliers before multiplying, this change is a bug fix to bring it into line with EQ's standard.<p>They probably noticed it when they put in code for the PoP Planar Durability ability and the the HP numbers they got in game didn't match what they were expecting.</B><p>For my money, that might as well be Geordi explaining why the warp drive is on the fritz--I don't get it, but it sure sounds smart. Congrats on all that book larnin', young feller.<p>I'm still waiting for official word on whether my seven missing hitpoints are gone intentionally or due to a bug. But as each day passes, it seems less and less likely that I'll ever see my seven little friends again.<p>But anyway, I'd like to introduce you all to my new hotkey:<p><I>/petition I just died due to being 7 HP short after your last patch. I would like a 100% exp rez pls thx.</I>
