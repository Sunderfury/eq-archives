Here then is your itinerary:<p><B><U>Several partial zone revamps coming to the Live servers.</u>  Droga and Nurga will be moving from Legends to the Live servers with our next update.  Along with those zones, we have completed partial revamps of several other zones:  The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and Velketor's Labyrinth.  We chose these zones to update based on feedback from players, and have implemented changes that will make these zones more entertaining to play in.  If you haven't been to one of these zones in a while, you may want to go back and revisit them after our next update.<p><U>Grieg's End changes going to the Legends server.</u>  Grieg's End is one of the more interesting zones in EverQuest, but the original design made pursuing the content in this zone a bit complicated.  The redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group.  These changes will revitalize this zone and should make it one of the more popular places for characters of the appropriate level to visit.<p><U>Tradeskill trivial failures will be reduced.</u>  Obviously even a great master can make mistakes.  EverQuest players, however, have expressed that they feel master tradeskillers fail on trivial items too frequently.  We have reviewed the trivial failure chances and have made a change to the way they work.  The greater the skill of the character relative to the skill needed to complete a recipe; the less likely he is to fail on a trivial recipe.<p><U>Damage Over Time Spell Foci update.</u>  We have implemented a change to focus items for Damage over Time (DoT) spells.  Focus items improve aspects of certain spells when they are cast.  Originally, DoT spells were included in a group of other spells that some focus items affected.  But the nature of DoT spells is very different than other spells, and the affect of these focus items on DoT spells was not what we wanted it to be.  To correct this, we have changed the Extended Affliction line to Burning Affliction, which cause DoT spells to do more damage, instead of having a longer duration.<p><U>New Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells will be introduced.</u>  Certain trade skill recipes rely on magic spells used to make normal items into magical items.  To make creating these magical items a little more convenient, we will be introducing new Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells that create five magical items rather than just one.  These spells require five components and take longer to cast and use more mana, but they should make creating these items much more convenient.<p><U>Newbie quests will be added for Erudites, Trolls and Ogres.</u>  New characters, especially if played by new players, need some time to get acquainted with the area surrounding their starting city.  One of the best ways to get those characters out into the world is to send them on quests.  We have been introducing new quests for new characters to each of the starting cities.  The next update will include quests for young Trolls beginning in Neriak, Ogres in Oggok and for Erudites starting out in Erudin, completing the updated newbie quests for all races.<p><U>Area of Effect spells that do not affect your group in PvP will also not affect your Raid.</u>  Taking on large tasks on a PvP server can be complicated by the fact that Area of Effect spells damage your own raid and not just the monsters.  It makes sense that since these spells do not affect your group on a PvP server, they should not affect your raid.<p><U>We've updated character creation descriptions.</u>  Players will now be able to right-click the class, race or statistic buttons during character creation to see a detailed explanation of the item clicked.  This will help folks when making decisions about what they want their character to be.<p>Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.<p>EQUI_Optionswnd.xml<br>UQUI.xml<br>EQUI_charactercreate.xml</b><p>I guess July's official catch phrase is &quot;zone revamps.&quot; While we knew they were coming, it didn't seem likely that we'd get them in a lump like this, and having the majority of them go to the non-Legends servers right off the bat is a nice bonus. It's tough to say just how partial the revamps are, but they picked some interesting zones to target. I am a bit puzzled why they worked on a relatively popular zone like Velk's Lab, though. Maybe they'll be removing those silly slippery bridges going to the kobolds and making the castle area usable for exp grouping.<p>The real question is whether the updated zones will be interesting enough to draw a crowd. Aside from Velk's, all the places mentioned require a bit of effort to get to, and none offer the safety net of graveyards that PoP provides. So what would make the zones become viable destinations? The classic trio: good loot, great exp, and fun. Interestingly, a lot of players are willing to sacrifice the third of those choices for either of the other two, and always have been. Why? Because the thrill of seeing your character advance (via experience, new items, or increased cash flow) is for many people every bit as compelling as a dungeon crawl in a fun/challenging zone. That's the whole reason groups have been willing to park their behinds in one spot and kill the same mobs over and over for the past four years. Whether zone revamps (or LDoN, for that matter) can do anything to modify that behavior really depends on the rewards that they provide.<p>As for the revamp to Grieg's End, well, they really couldn't make it any less fun than it currently is, so just about any change would be an improvement. Grats, Stormhammer!<p>Tradeskillers will love having less trivial failures, and the change only makes sense. Likewise, the mass imbue spells (which <A HREF="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2003-06-24%2020:31:22">showed up on Lucy</a> a little over a week ago) make life easier for crafty types. But I'd like to see other innovations come to tradeskills. What about something akin to critical hits, where an artisan had a very, very slim chance to create an exceptional item with better stats, or perhaps to make a double batch of a given item? Little things like this would make tradeskills more than just a diversion, and could introduce a bit of fun into the process.<p>The DoT focus effect thing should be popular. Basically it sounds like the spells will do more damage per tick within the same duration. Hmmm, pity they don't give pure melee (the walking, talking, complaining version of a DoT) focus items that let them do more damage. Oh, that's right, they do... in Plane of Time.<p>The newbie and PvP changes are nice enough, but few people (outside of the Zek server populations, which some would argue are the very definition of &quot;few people&quot;) will make a lot of noise about them. Or if they do, the poor souls will be drowned out by the wails of &quot;WTF NO MELEE BALANCE YET?!?!&quot; echoing through the lands.<p>Such is the life of a patch, I guess, even if it is a week away.<p><BIG>Prexus Wears Concrete Galoshes</big><p>Absor contritely posted the <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=57276">eulogy for a server</a> today:<p><B>There's no good way to say this.  Prexus failed again.  The bad news is that some characters may have to be restored from a 24 hour old backup.  Some may be restored from a newer backup, and some may not be lost at all.<p>We will be removing the cursed thing that was the Prexus server and we will melt it down.  It will be replaced with brand new, curse-free hardware.  Unfortunately this will take some time.  Our operations folks will be working on it until it is up and running again, and we hope to have it restored before the holiday weekend begins.</b><p>It's been nearly a month since Prexus had its <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=56698">last critical failure</a> that resulted in major downtime. The good news, I guess, is that the problem has already been <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=57288">fixed</a>:<p><B>Just wanted to let you all know that Prexus is up and running again as of about 7:30pm.</b><p>Let's hope the old hardware has indeed found its way to the incinerator. Either that, or Sony could combine Prexus with the Star Wars Galaxies registration server and use it to host head-to-head Pong tournaments.<p>Actually, that sounds kinda fun. Where do I plug in my Atari 2600 paddle controller?<p><BIG>The Taxman Cometh</big><p>Sony <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=57212">announced</a> a change to the lives of online Euros, courtesy of EU law:<p><B>To comply with changes in the law in the European Union, Sony Online Entertainment game Subscribers who are residents of EU countries will be charged VAT equal to 17.5% of the subscription fees. These changes require that digital services be taxed at the point of consumption, i.e. in your country of residence.  The countries  currently covered by this policy are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom.</b><p>Americans tend to freak out when they see somebody mention a 17.5% tax, while some Euros point to their healthcare and pension systems as making it all worthwhile. Personally, I see it as a 17.5% ubermob spawn tax. Congrats to the EU for figuring out a way to cash in on Euroguild time zone advantages!<p>Oh come on, you didn't think I'd miss the chance to bring that up again, did you?<p><BIG>Fluffy's Due for an Ass Whoopin'</big><p>Eat your heart out, Harry Potter. Guild <A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife</a> has travelled still farther into Plane of Time, coming face to face with the <A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/news/2003-07-03-2.php">wickedest monstrosity</a> yet. AL also got to listen to the elemental gods <A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/news/2003-07-03-3.php">babbling</a> about how wimpy they are compared to players. Cry me a river, Mr. Rathe! Oh yeah, and the Captain Planet jokes are already old, so I won't bother linking to them here.<p>My prediction: Afterlife makes their way to Zebuxoruk, only to find that the mysterious deity is actually... LORD BRITISH! The poor bastard has been exiled to Plane of Time by gangs of angry Lineage fanatics, and now his Lordship has decided to wreak havoc upon unsuspecting EQ players. Remember, you heard it here first!<p><BIG>WTB Snowblower, PST</big><p>Being from Minnesota, I know whereof I speak when I say that things can turn nasty real fast in a Blizzard. Seems that the popular gaming company recently had a <A HREF="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/diablo2/news_6030882.html">spot of trouble</a> when four big names resigned from the Blizzard North studio--the part of the company that makes Diablo (not the Warcraft titles, which are made by their other team).<p>Why the sudden defection? Well, Blizzard is part of Vivendi Universal, which has been trying to liquidate its gaming division, and it seems recent corporate decisions weren't in line with the creative direction of Blizzard North's Bill Roper, Erich Schaefer, Max Schaefer, and David Brevik. <A HREF="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/news/news_6030892.html">Roper says</a> the quartet will start a new company, but assures everyone that Blizzard will be just fine without them.<p>This doesn't prevent the <A HREF="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=a5a0a7a6c67fa761c22bc0c97df50825&amp;threadid=7815">inevitable fanboi panic</a> from setting in, of course. And honestly, it's not without merit--more than one gaming company has fallen victim to corporate shell games and the resulting mass defections. It would be a major bummer if Worlds of Warcraft suffered because Vivendi only cares about cashing in. Of course, some WoW fans are equally as concerned with someone like Microsoft or EA coming along and buying Blizzard, since the company's high standards might suffer.<p>While I don't yet believe that WoW is going to be the MMOG messiah that some claim, I do agree that it's going to be an significant force in the market. And anytime art is made to suffer at the hands of economics, it's bound to lead to tragedy. Let's hope Blizzard digs their way out of the snowbank before they go all Donner Party or something.<p>Have a happy holiday, everyone.
