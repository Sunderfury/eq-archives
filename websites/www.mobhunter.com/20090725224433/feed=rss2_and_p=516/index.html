		<description>So you&#039;re saying all my wonderful insight isn&#039;t worth anything? My world is shattered! In all seriousness though you&#039;re absolutely correct. Ideas, even good ones, are all over the place. Execution is a problem not unique to the MMO industry. I&#039;ve seen plenty of projects in my career go really wrong really quickly because of poor follow through.

I don&#039;t subscribe to the &quot;blame the player&quot; slant myself. Players do have some unreasonable expectations now but they&#039;ve also been disappointed over and over again. It is a vicious cycle for sure. I can&#039;t blame some folks for being cynical though. 

It would, in my mind, be better to get a few things completely right at launch. Players would accept this as long as developers communicated clearly what their plan was for the long term and executed in a timely fashion. The patch cycle has gotten so long these days it is almost laughable when you see the pay off. Who hasn&#039;t heard &quot;We waited 3+ months for this?!&quot; I know I hear it all the time. 

Do things right when you can and make sure your players know what your goal is. I see communication as the biggest issue in the industry these days. If development was a little more transparent we&#039;d be happier players. The whole argument of &quot;if we say anything everyone expects exactly that and tries to hold us to some notion&quot; is tiresome. Don&#039;t promise what you can&#039;t deliver and grow a thicker skin if you end up falling short!</description>

		<description>Agreed Amsra Lytebringer,
They are being closed mouthed which makes the mystery seem even better.
That and I&#039;ve always respected the major names associated with this project.</description>

		<description>Vanguard at release was amazing despite all the bugs. IMHO what killed it was insanely high sys reqs and bugs. The initial gameplay was great...... I did finally leave after a year or so as I saw the game getting dumbed down and even a year in saw how much SOE was cutting their resources. Hell, 1-50 it is still a great game if only there were the people to support the level curve all the way thru. Had they just fixed bugs and optimized code for the first year, I would probly still be playing VG. Instead they changed core game systems right and left, with sometimes seemingly little overall direction. it still is a great game, the racial newbie areas are all awesome to play but it has become so easy that one gets bored easily :)

I totally agree with you about making it all jell :) I do have have some hope with you guys tho..... As close mouthed as you&#039;ve been about Copernicus, it&#039;s obvious you have a very focused team :)</description>

		<description>Nice article! I agree that good ideas are cheap, the devil is in the details -- implementation and execution are paramount.

It&#039;s interesting to see in retrospect how wrong Furor was. Lucky for him that he got hired at Blizzard to be a part of WoW. 

I find it also interesting that Brad McQuaid when he learned that Furor landed a job at Blizzard, once made the comment that he would have hired Furor on the spot if he knew he was looking for a job in the MMO industry.

Given what happened to Sigil and Vanguard, chances are that Furor would probably now  be designing quests for Free Realms or some other SOE product. Lucky for him he chose Blizzard over Sigil. :)</description>

		<description>&quot;More often than not, itâ€™s a few specific weaknesses in crucial areas that cause certain games to be considered a disappointment in the eyes of players.&quot;

Beautifully summed up. Games like AoC and WAR, IMO, suffered because of a few small weaknesses rather than any single huge gapping flaw.</description>

		<description>@Kendricke - I know it&#039;s not a popular viewpoint.  I just tend to try and look at all sides of the problem.  But I would not, of course, blame everything on the customer, just like I wouldn&#039;t blame everything on the developers.  Why would I?  There is plenty of blame to go around :)  But yes...players are to blame for certain failures of games.  That&#039;s because in MMOs players are a integral part of the game.  It&#039;s not really the first time I&#039;ve advocated this viewpoint.

To be honest, players have ruined many games for me.  So have design elements.  Sometimes design elements have been created or modified to deal with certain players...griefers for example.  If I&#039;m wrong, I&#039;m sure Moorgard will say something...but at some point in development the team looks at a component or feature and says, &quot;Now...how can asshats ruin this?&quot;  &quot;Will asshats ruin this feature for other players?&quot;  And that&#039;s too bad.  It&#039;s a reality of design, but still too bad.  But changes are made.  That&#039;s just a quick example, but there are definitely ways that the &quot;customer&quot; shares in some of the blame.

@Owlchick - LOL.  Getting people excited about your game and leading them on are two different things.  On the Mortal Online site they state - &quot;...you and your allies will be able to rule an entire nation.&quot;  Well, we damn well better be able to.  But we were told this before when we were told we could capture and sack our enemy&#039;s city.  But Mortal Online does have a decent explanation of what you can expect in the game.  None of this...&quot;Choose from thousands of skills to be the ultimate adventurer ever!!!&quot; kind of crap.  Of course, hype is subjective.  I try to go into games with an open mind.  Many do not.  Message boards are filled with posts like &quot;I thought it would be like this...&quot;, &quot;If they just...&quot;,  &quot;The devs said...&quot;, and the ever popular &quot;I&#039;ve redesigned your combat system for you...&quot;</description>

		<description>It&#039;s just like any game, even console ones (although they do have less depth), when designing you can have something that seems good on paper, but three years later does it all add up to something that is fun?

I think there are only a few ways to know, one would be the Blizzard way where you take what works with competitiors games and simply refine it, and the other is to be able to have the time once everything is together to iterate over it to find how things work together best.  

So Snebli is correct in saying that given another full year, Vanguard probably could have been more successful.  

Of course sometimes even that is not enough, as &#039;fun&#039; and &#039;entertaining&#039; are subjective and it all depends on the designers point of view.</description>

		<description>Execution is just a requirement, not easily solved and very hard even when everyone knows what to do.

Bad ideas with execution sell and still make a profit.  Good ideas without execution do not sell.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Itâ€™s weird how I did read your article the first time, but got so focused on the one point that is shaded everything else you said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No problem. :) Does this phenomenon have a name? Because it&#039;s the cause for about half the fights that happen on message boards.

I have no issue with anyone who feels Vanguard is the best MMO for them. Like I mentioned in a previous post, I realized while working in record stores that any album you pick up is somebody&#039;s favorite record--it&#039;s all about what resonates with the individual.

@Snebli - One of the reasons we&#039;ve been so careful about releasing information is that we don&#039;t want to create a community obsessing about small details too early. It just gets unhealthy if you say too much before you can actually show what your product actually is.</description>
