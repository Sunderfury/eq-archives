		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll have to disagree on the GW2 questing style. I like the personal quests in GW2 but once those sort of ran out, I just felt like I was wandering from spot to spot, doing heart quests, collecting vistas or talents while waiting for an event to trigger/start.

It sounds like there was a lot to do, but it wasn&#039;t things I enjoyed for a length of time. Vista jump puzzles? Bleh. Talent/trait battles? Pretty much a stomp the NPC with all the other people there to get their trait (in the odd occasion it was more about clicking on a spot). The events, themselves, weren&#039;t all that spectacular and were pretty repetitive.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, in no way am I saying WoW questing is better - it isn&#039;t. I just don&#039;t think GW2&#039;s mechanism warrants the credit it is getting... unless you&#039;re an explorer type. It really caters well to people that like exploring.

I&#039;m still waiting for something that suites me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if it be possible to commune with my dear brother after so many moons have passed.  Long ago we faced challenge and adventure together and forged a bond worthy of legend.  The north wind has never ceased its blowing old friend.  A vergence was sensed by me in the cool afternoon breeze and honor compelled me to heed its call.  Let us see if you remember the old ways and the code that was established in ancient days long past.  I shall meditate on this and hope that proves to be so.  Perhaps your chi will be stirred as well great one.
