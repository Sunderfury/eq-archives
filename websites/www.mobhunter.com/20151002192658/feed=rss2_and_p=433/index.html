		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t mean to be so negative...but I was there when community management was born.  Community management is like the packet of directions a man overlooks when putting together that swing set...or bike...or Wii Fit.  People just don&#039;t care about it until there is a specific reason to care.

Giving community managers developer status went just so far.  People realized that those community managers were allowed to round up info from the *real* developers and pass on what they were allowed to pass on.  Ehn, nothing special.  Now you have the modern day patch notes.

The worst that happened to me and others like me was people learned how to do or use things themselves.  That&#039;s the funny thing about games or applications.  People want to figure things out for themselves or throw their hands up in the middle of the living room and scream.

What went on before is us sitting back and responding.  I think the wave of the future needs to be more proactive.  Or, community managers must be allowed to be more proactive.  Talking about the product.  Mingling.  Letting users/subscribers know their suggestions and concerns have been taken in and at least given the once over.  It has to be more than moderation.

Sorry...a nerve..LOL]]></description>
