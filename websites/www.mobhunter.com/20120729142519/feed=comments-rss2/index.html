		<description>Hi there...I am a big fan of KOAR...I purchased the game and loved it from the first moment...love the art, the gameplay and everything else. It even pulled me away from Skyrim and I was looking forward to the MMO ...
I can only imagine how it feels to loose your job and the hope to see your creation brought to the market. I would even have payed a subscription for it. 
Hope somebody picks up the Assetts andt he IP down the line as it was so promising...</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t how this would work, but is there ANY chance that the IP/Assets could be picked up by another studio? Someone else willing to bring it to completion?</description>

		<description>For what it&#039;s worth, I liked the trailer. I liked the art style. It really looked like a world that I could relax in and enjoy.

It&#039;s just too bad that it took this fiasco to see this much of it.</description>

		<description>Much love man.  I understand why those emotions would be stirred and while it made me sad that it will go unfulfilled, I am glad that this at least saw the light of day.  Art direction looks amazing.</description>
