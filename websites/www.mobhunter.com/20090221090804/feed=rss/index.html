		<title>Why I&#8217;m a Letterman Guy</title>
		<description>There are two kinds of people in the world: Letterman people and Leno people.

Jay Leno is a funny guy, and he has bits that make me chuckle, but I mourn where he's taken The Tonight Show from what it once was. This television tradition now feels like a bowl of ...</description>

		<title>Nerd Immersion Complete</title>
		<description>I'm back from NYCC and had a great time. The panel on 38 Studios went well, even though there have been a few complaints about us not talking about the game--this despite the very first slide and the panel intro making extremely clear that we would not be talking about ...</description>

		<title>Comic Conning</title>
		<description>This weekend I'm headed back to the Big Apple with several 38 Studios cohorts to take part in a panel discussion at New York Comic Con. The theme of the panel is "MMO Development: Year Two." It's a follow-up to last year's panel in which we talked about, uh, year ...</description>

		<title>Imposing Odds</title>
		<description>Lum recently made the best quote about game design I've heard in a long time:
Game design, in many ways, is convincing players that they won a struggle against imposing odds. It does not mean actually creating imposing odds.
Scott's responses to #2 and #5 in particular are spot on. I admit ...</description>

		<title>LFM 25 Naxx 2 more tanks 2 more DKs</title>
		<description>Kotaku goes into a nerd rage over this video, but I must be getting old. Maybe I'm just used to gamers and geeks being misunderstood and stereotyped by the mainstream media, but I actually found the piece funny and charming.

Yeah it would have been more fair to compare gamers to ...</description>

		<title>I Don&#8217;t See the Big Deal</title>
		<description>This is how I talk to Shwayder on a daily basis. It's called management skills, people! Get off Batman's back already. </description>

		<title>Look, I Just Need You to Do This One Thing For Me</title>
		<description>I don't ask for much from you, gentle readers. Really, I don't, especially compared to the amount ofÂ  joy I bring to your lives.

So I hope you will take the following request seriously.

I need you to go here and sign this petition. Don't ask questions. You don't need to know ...</description>

		<title>The Origin of Moowlchick</title>
		<description>Over on the SOE blog, my friend Tracy posted her hazy recollection of how she and I began working together.

She insists that the soda story is true, though I cannot verify it. Honestly, until I was told that a designer named Tracy would be sharing an office with me, I ...</description>

		<title>Cautionary Tales</title>
		<description>Scott Jennings made an excellent post in response to a former NCsoft executive's examination of what went wrong with Tabula Rasa. Both are hefty reads (especially the Martin link) but provide excellent perspectives on how one mega-budget MMOG went wrong and how another title never got off the ground.

So if ...</description>
