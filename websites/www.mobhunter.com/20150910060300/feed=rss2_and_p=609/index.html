		<description><![CDATA[Real names is bad.  Even at FanFaires I only used to introduce myself as my character&#039;s name, which gets weird after a couple days but is a whole lot better than someone showing up on my doorstep uninvited.

As ridiculous as it sounds to non-gamers, I think we all know that (sadly) it wouldn&#039;t be long before in-game disputes turned nasty in the real world if some of the crazies had the chance to do it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There was some speculation that it&#039;s because of some South Korean law. It seems counter intuitive that having real names out there would be a huge benefit.  Granted people will tend to act different on the forum with their anonymity stripped, but it just provides more information for them to act like jack asses outside of the forum.

I can just imagine how many death threats I would have personally received as a result of a change like this, I&#039;d be able to build a house with the bricks flying through my windows.

I am no lawyer (or am I? You can&#039;t tell because I&#039;m anonymous!), but I believe that Blizzard may be deferring the hassle of monitoring their messageboards in exchange for lawsuits later on when someone uses this information to find someone who ninja looted something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Totally agree and very well said. I take a lot of pleasure out of chosing my character name and trying to tie it to some sort of personality and background. Sure, very few people may enquire or appreciate it but it&#039;s all part of the magic of MMOs. I really don&#039;t want to known by my real name in every game I play and every related forum :( Aside from the privacy issues, there really is no fun or escapism in that.]]></description>
