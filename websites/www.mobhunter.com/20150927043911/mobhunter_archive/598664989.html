This was actually included in lastnight's patch but was not mentioned. <p>- To address the competition between epic-seeking bards and other classes, the infamous White Dragon Scale is no longer used in the quest given by Karam Dragonforge in Rathe Mountains. The quest now requires a White Dragon Hide. We did not reduce the rate at which White Dragon Scales enter the world, but rather added new potential for the new White Dragon Hide to be found. <p>** Focus Items ** <p>- Spell casting time foci should report their new casting time properly. <p>- Spell duration foci designed to affect DoTs (the Affliction line) should now work reliably. <p>- Spell duration foci affecting beneficial spells are no longer random. They now always extend the affected buffs for their maximum. (We never wanted to make it harder to time your buffs.) <p>- The Affliction focus line should now only be affecting spells that do damage. <p>- Bards should no longer get focus item messages that weren't actually affecting them. <p>- We've re-assigned quite a few of the focus items to have their originally intended effect. <p>All of the same items have focus effects. However, as many people noticed, quite a few effects were mis-assigned due to a tools error. (Common, mid level items were frequently being assigned high level effects, and vice versa.) <p>This situation has been fixed, and the items now have the effects that we originally planned for them. <p>** Firiona Vie ** <p>- Your server should once again have Trivial Loot Code enabled. Sorry for changing the rules on you. <p>** Chat Channels ** <p>- Should once again work reliably for people who are using NAT or IP Masquerading via certain networking devices. <p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>The first paragraph is interesting. One wonder what &quot;a small amount faster&quot; means. A change to the spawn timers of various mobs would be interesting, since on many servers guilds are so desperate to beat out the competition that they camp groups at spawn points in hopes of catching mobs first.<p>It will take a week or two to determine just how fast mobs are entering the world now, and you shouldn't expect to see much of a difference, but just about any increase in spawns would be welcome.<p>Bards should be pleased by the second paragraph. As one of our readers <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=1893537748&amp;msgid=697442753#message">noted</a>, bards would find themselves competing for the white dragon scale against casters hoping to score another focus item. Now the cloak and the epic no longer require the same piece, loosening the competition greatly. Grats, prancers.<p>Many of the <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=17129.topic">changes</a> made to items with focus effects still <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=17239.topic">don't please everyone</a>, of course. Some casters think a few effects that did seem logical are changed now, and odd effects were only exchanged for equally odd ones. Of course, if every player was happy then the universe would end, so it's probably a good sign that some casters think they're getting <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/06/04/uk.dolphin/index.html">screwed</a>.<p>Mayhem from yesterday's patch continues. Seems that caster NPCs have been raiding a lot and have acquired some pretty <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11243.topic">harsh spells</a>. This certainly adds a new twist to many zones that have become somewhat trivialized. Even the Kael arena might be tricky now.<p>Okay, that's enough for today, I hope. Any more patches and I'm bound to snap.<p><B>*** Updated 1:30PM Central ***</B><p>Seems the servers are down again, but not due to a patch. Verant forgot to pay their electric bill, and so the whole company has gone dark. Even now Scott Hartsman and his crack team are busy hooking up generators powered by hamster wheels to get the servers running again. We need more power, Scotty!<p><I>Updated yet again!</I><p>Mr. Hartsman read my little jest above and was kind enough to respond:<p><B>Actually, that'd be our crack Game and Network Operations groups, who handle the care and feeding of the fairly massive server farm.  The development team knows better than to attempt to touch hardware.  <p>While most of us do have a natural affinity for Large Boxes with Blinky Lights, we find that things work best when we leave actually messing with them to the trained professionals.<p>We just make game software -- It can't electrocute us. :)</B><p>Which still doesn't answer the question of why no backup generators kept the servers going, but that's okay. I was only picking on Hartsman because I wanted to use a Scotty reference anyway.<p>Live long and prosper.
