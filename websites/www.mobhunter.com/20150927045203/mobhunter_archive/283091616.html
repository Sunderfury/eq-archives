<html><head><title>Coming Clean</title></head><body><h1>Coming Clean</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-12-04</p><BIG>Patching Things Up</BIG><p><B>December 4, 2002  3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>** Zones **<p>- Updated the sage quests in the Plane of Knowledge.<br>- Addressed several bugs with the Rallos Zek encounter.<br>- Vallon Zek's script should now work correctly.<p>** Spells **<p>- Fixed a bug with lull and harmony type spells that could cause zone-wide agro.<br>- Reduced the fizzle rate on Beastlord spells to match that of all other hybrid classes.<br>- Fixed a bug that was allowing some charmed NPCs to break mez.<br>- Blinding spells will now affect characters on horseback.<br>- Spells that automatically target your pet will now work (on your regular pet) when you have a Servant of Ro.<br>- You should be able to heal and buff your regular pet when using Host of Elements or Wake the Dead.<br>- Eldritch rune should now absorb more damage<br>- The last patch changes to Mental Corruption made it too powerful for a level 52 spell.  The damage has been toned down, and the mana recourse has been changed to scale from level 52 to 60<p>** Music Player **<p>- Typing /mp3 with no arguments will now bring up the Music Player.<br>- When saving play lists, the player will automatically remove any extension on the filename entered and replace it with .m3u.  Since only files with the .m3u extension can be loaded as playlists by the Music Player, this should remove some &quot;can't load a list I just saved&quot; issues.<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>If you are working to explore Planes of Power without progressing through the storyline, you may find that the alternate methods to enter some zones now goes a little bit faster.</B><p>Well, nothing that's going to make anyone fall out of their seats with excitement, I guess.<p>It seems that the quest to get into Karana's Bastion of Thunder <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=12464.topic">has been made easier</a> thanks to the addition of new mini-bosses in Plane of Storms that drop more of the required medallion pieces. Presumably drop rates on other PoP key quest items have been increased as well. In case you weren't aware, you can gain access to some planes--such as Crypt of Decay and Halls of Honor--without killing an ubermob. Up until now, though, the key quests have been long and tedious, involving very rare drops. This change will hopefully give people who aren't in big guilds access to a few new hunting grounds beyond the four &quot;free&quot; planes and Valor/Storms. <p>Pet owners should be pleased by a few changes, and enchanters get some mez fixes and so forth. For details on all the spell changes, check out <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Live&amp;date=2002-12-04%2011:07:12">what Lucy has to say</a>.<p>Beastlords should be happy kitties with adjusted fizzle rates, though shadowknights are <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=e9e5daf62fbc70af1fc158d9a0cb4f42&amp;threadid=8915">a bit mixed</a> on their feelings about the Mental Corruption change. Some are crying nerf, but the more reasonable SKs see the scaling as fair.<p>The change to the Rallos Zek encounter isn't unexpected if you keep up with <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">Afterlife's site</a>, as Thott explained how buggy the fight is. This will presumably make things easier for the next guilds doing the encounter, though we'll have to wait for reports on just exactly how much Mr. Zek has been adjusted.<p>By the way, the <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/?page=rzflag">character flag information</a> after the Rallos encounter gives the indication that yes, there is actually a coherent plot to Planes of Power. Will it all make sense once the Plane of Time has been legitimately cracked? There's always hope. In the meantime, we look forward to info on the planes of Water, Earth, and Air.<p>As always, if you find any hidden changes, either post below or <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">drop me a line</a>.<p><I>Edit: Things must not have gone so well, as an emergency patch was announced today:</I><p><B>On Thursday, December 5th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a brief update. The estimated downtime is 2 hours.</B><p><I>Reasons? Maybe the SK change scaled too well, maybe the new giant sub-bosses in PoS were respawning a bit too quickly. Guess we'll know tomorrow.</I><p><BIG>Cartographer No More</BIG><p>A sad but not unexpected announcement graces the front page of the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">EQ Atlas</a> Web site. Muse has announced that he has no plans to make any further maps due to time and money concerns:<p><B>I had been hoping, at some point, to make a book of the maps I have on this site in order to make enough money to recupe what I had spent in terms of time in the creation and support of the site. After SOE bent me over a barrel, the major publishers felt there wasn't a large enough market for another book, and I don't have the time to create one on my own, so that idea is pretty much dead in the water.</B><p>Muse has put a tremendous amount of time into his site (which will remain up and running, by the way), and his maps are still the best out there. I'll never forget my first run from Freeport to Qeynos, back when I didn't know a soul who could teleport. Without those maps, my corpses would be littering the Karanas to this day.<p>There are other people making maps of PoP, but none will have quite the touch that Muse did. His contributions will be missed.<p><BIG>On the Next Springer: Monkeys Slinging Mud</BIG><p>The tumult continues at the monk board, with outrage over the sale of the board/site to Yantis resulting in a rampant flame-fest. The way threads are being locked away, you'd think they were spinning gold over there.<p>The latest chapter of the spiralling saga finds the former administrator <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=34957.topic">quitting</a> (we'll see how long that lasts) over reams of hate mail. Well, I'm not sure how anyone could have anticipated such a transaction to go smoothly, but some people are taking things a bit far.<p>It seems likely that an offshoot monk board will rise out of this--perhaps one that isn't tied to EZBoard's purse strings. And it will take about two days for that one to devolve into a &quot;I have 100K to twink my level 10 monk, what should I buy?&quot; board.<p>EQ sites really are a nice alternative to daytime TV, don't you think?<p><BIG>Show Me the EQ</BIG><p>EverQuest has made the <a href="http://features.slashdot.org/features/02/12/01/1558220.shtml">pages of Slashdot</a> once again, this time in regards to the battle between Sony and the developers of ShowEQ.<p>Why is this newsworthy? After all, these two forces have been locked in combat for years. The never-ending cycle of break SEQ-fix SEQ has been repeating since the shadowy product was first released.<p>Well, the current post-PoP phase of the conflict finds the SEQ people working on a Windows version of their software, which presumably would make the Sony folks want to check users' machines to make sure they aren't running it. This leads into several grey areas explored by <a href="http://www.unknownplayer.com/archive/02/06/10/737.php">recent lawsuits</a> about the legality of end user license agreements. The EULA, in case you weren't aware, is the text that flashes on screen as soon as you run EQ, and you have to hit the Accept button before you can access your characters.<p>Does SOE have the right to inspect your machine before they let you play their game? Should they be allowed to force you to play fairly? Is anything that runs on your computer really yours, or are you merely leasing someone else's intellectual property? Exactly how much are you liable for when you click that Accept button?<p>Those are some pretty weighty questions. Most people just want SEQ to tell them when named mobs are up.<p>At any rate, that's why the eyes of the industry are upon our little corner of the online universe. Hey, it's better than more ham-fisted network news stories about player suicides, I guess.<p>
