If you're not, and you happened to take a wrong turn and walk into the convention area, you'd probably become very, very scared--but that's another article.<p>Over on the necro boards, one FanFaire attendee <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forumsnew/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=7754&amp;FORUM_ID=1&amp;CAT_ID=1&amp;Topic_Title=Back+from+Fan+Faire+%2D+the+new%2C+the+maybe%2C+and+more&amp;Forum_Title=General+Discussions">reveals</a> some nuggets from Lawrence Poe, EQ's spell guru and all-around cool guy. Most are only of interest to necros, but a couple things are worth noting here:<p><B>Both Sks and Paladins will be able to summon horses... [Verant is] Looking at way to add two more spells slots which can only mem self only spells... Oh, and about the discipline lifetap. What it is, is this. Same for wizards also.<p>ALL your mana is used in this discipline to do the SAME amount of damage. You got 3000 mana..BAM...3000 DD. Now no mana.</B><p>The reference in that last part is to a couple of the apparent <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-1761122477">caster disciplines</a> that may be showing up in Luclin. I'm not sure why a caster would want to blow all their mana in a 1:1 ratio, especially after all the recent changes to the magic resistances of mobs. Wizards <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=7948.topic">don't</a>, either. Lets wait and see what becomes of this, I guess.<p>Other important news out of Orlando, courtesy of my buddy Xelbaaz:<p><B>I learned a great lesson that will help me be better prepared next time I am in Orlando....<p>&quot;Sale of alcohol stops at 2am&quot;<p>Sad, but true!</B><p>We were anticipating a flood of Luclin info, along with demonstrations of the new character models. Xelbaaz didn't see much of that, apparently. Then again, he may have been waiting for the liquor stores to open instead of attending important panel discussions.<p><B>*** Updated 10 AM CST ***</B><p>Over at the Safehouse boards, Jerrith Healerson posted a nice <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8458.topic">summary</a> of what he learned at FanFaire. Turns out there was some neat info forthcoming after all (curse you, Xelbaaz!). Some highlights are listed here:<p><B>Wizard Familiars:<p>They're going to be pets with no commands, that are set to follow their master. They do not generate agro. They can be hit by AEs however, and can also be made immune (or perhaps just very strong) vs it. Each one gives bonuses to all your resists (about 5 on the first one, increasing with each). The second one has and gives you see invis, and as a result, won't die if the controlling wizard goes invis. Familiars will also reduce their wizard's fizzle rate. The 49th level familiar gives some mana regen. The first two use the imp model, the next two use the drake model. They also give extra mana, with the top one giving something like 200-300 mana. They will zone with their controller, and will also logout (and log back in) with their player.<p>Alternate Exp:<p>Very little was said about it. It's &quot;like&quot; Diablo skill trees. Permanent stat and resists improvements will be possible. 1 point will be like the equivalent of gaining enough exp to go from 51 to 52.<p>Metal Info:<p>There's a new metal in Luclin called Acrylia. It comes from giant mushrooms.  There's a zone called the Acrylia Mines off of the Grimling Forest (which has some of these mushrooms). Expect it to be enchantable.<p>Reaching Luclin:<p>Wizards and Druids will NOT be able to port between the current world and Luclin. Every 45 minutes, at the large (like Greater Faydark) wizard spires, a scripted event will take place, giving people the opportunity to go to The Nexus, the entry zone. There's no delay to zone back to the various spires from The Nexus. There will be druid and wizard ports within Luclin. Death MAY send you back to the nexus if you die in Luclin and are bound in the current world, instead of to your bind point. Cleric Rezes will bring people to their corpse, regardless of location. (People leaving corpses to quickly move between planets is a concern though.)<p>Bazaar Zone:<p>There's a zone setup just to be a bazaar. The big new feature here is this: You'll be able to specify items you want to sell to other players, and set your character up to act like a NPC merchant selling those items. This feature will only be available within this zone. Yes, leaving your character online, overnight in this zone while you're afk is expected. (BTW, The Bazaar does have a horse stable for you to buy your horses from.)</B><p>He then goes through a very nice list of the zones, with descriptions of most of them. Check it out.<p>Other miscellaneous items Jerrith posted:<p><B>There's a new graphical patcher which looks very nice, and handles all the patching at once, along with an autoplay option, to get you into the game faster. <p>Items which will adjust your faction (good and bad) when you hold them.<p>Weapons that do extra / alternate damage types. Cleric summoned hammers already have Bane DMG vs undead. Extra DMG for Magic, Fire, Cold, Poison and Disease are expected as well (perhaps) bane dmg for other creature types.<p>There's a new user interface coming which you'll be able to heavily customize (including setting a custom bitmap as a background for a window, if you choose), which wasn't ready yet. Also, the only new player character model in the game was the vah shir model, the rest were old ones. NPCs wearing hats were much more common. One human guard in plate in Katta Castellum had a really nice big curved axe.<p>And one old world thing: There's no port near Qeynos because there was going to be one in the Unkempt Wood, off of Surefall Glade. This zone hasn't been created yet, however, but if (IF) it is, expect a druid ring there.</B><p>That's a really good batch of info. If anything else interesting or <a href="http://www.lego.com/studios/screening/movie.asp?title=montypython">entertaining</a> turns up, we'll post another update.
