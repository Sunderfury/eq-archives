If you have a lesser processor, the tentative minimum spec is:<p>P-2 400<br>128MB Ram<br>Nvidia GeForce Card<br>Another 400MB or so of free HDD space.<p>The recommended system spec will be a P3 or Athalon Processor with a GeForce 2 or better video card and 256MB of RAM.</B><p>Okay, someone tell Verant that it's &quot;Athlon,&quot; not &quot;Athalon.&quot;<p>Aside from the misspelling, these specs are pretty much what I anticipated after seeing the demo at FanFaire. I think you'll want a 1 gHz processor or better, GeForce 3, and 512 megs of RAM to be really happy, though.<p>Think the specs are too high? Too low?
