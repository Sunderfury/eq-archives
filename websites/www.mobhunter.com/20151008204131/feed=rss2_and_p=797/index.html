		<description><![CDATA[To be clear, I wasn&#039;t complaining about dungeon finder. I have been playing a fair amount of WoW again lately, and I use it a lot--especially at lunch time. It&#039;s extremely good at what it does, particularly with the layers of polish about putting you back exactly where you left off in the &quot;regular&quot; world.

I&#039;m just pointing out that it&#039;s a tradeoff. You are sacrificing relatedness for content accessibility. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s a bad trade; clearly WoW does just fine with it. I&#039;m just saying it&#039;s a conscious design choice that goes beyond the arguments I often hear against it, like how it ruins exploration or the sense of worldliness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The balancing act is sizing the MMO so &quot;bite sized&quot; content runs of 30 minutes or less isn&#039;t considered a cop-out or a let-down in some way.  WoW&#039;s concept of the &quot;lunch time battleground&quot; was a very good one and a huge part of it&#039;s initial success.

Quick, Automated grouping is part of what enables that.  Running LDoN, a strong group could clear some missions in 30 minutes, and you could string 2-3 sessions together relatively quickly. Doesn&#039;t sound so bad, right?  How long did it take you to assemble that strong group? Have trouble finding a healer, wipe a couple of times, etc, and you&#039;re at 90 minutes and haven&#039;t done anything yet besides get frustrated with the random folks you&#039;ve manually paired yourself with.

The real problem in the equation is that there&#039;s a decent chunk of players who *need* the automated functions to properly experience content in the game in the time they have.  Then, you get the min-max crowd jumping in as well because its just faster. 

Limiting the number of runs you can make in instances, particularly for free players, is one option. Not enabling some instances for auto-grouping is another.   To do it right though, you have to allow some extra time to move content into the queuing system as new stuff gets released.

And I don&#039;t care if its an old fashioned pick up group or an automated match maker, the odds of me not talking are low. :)]]></description>
