<html><head><title>ASCII = Old School</title></head><body><h1>ASCII = Old School</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-09-26</p>When Absor talks, we listen. Then we cut-n-paste some junk for you to read, so that you don't have to go to the Verant message board yourself and get bombarded by advertising.<p>About the strange ASCII characters that have taken to appearing in our chat windows since the patch:<p><B>We are aware of it and working on fixing it. We know what caused it and we should have it fixed shortly.<p>Sorry about the problem. The bug is only a bit of extra oddball text, it won't cause any other problems.</B><p>Does anyone remember what ASCII stands for? Give yourself a l33t, old-school pat on the back if you do.<p><I>This is in regards to the mouselook changes. I almost exclusively use the fourth view (first being first person, second being overhead, third being chase and fourth being the movable, stationary camera). This view is not almost unusable for me. I have to be able to see my character when in this view. Because the camera is movable, I don't know which way my character is facing unless I can see him. I also don't know how close I am to falling off that cliff or falling into the water unless I see my character. When casting a spell on the run, I need to be able to see just how close that mob is to me. Currently, I can only see myself if I zoom way out, this distorts the distance and is very unclear. Currently, when I zoom in to my character, the camera is located way above my head and looks straight out, missing my character. Before, it would angle down so that you would always be in view of your character. The fifth view was very similar, but the camera was not as high. This fifth view currently is way above the characters head, which is almost unplayable.<br>Please look into this, please please please give me a view that allows the floating camera but also let's me see my character at all times.<p>Thanks<br>Gokusprout<br>160ish days played on Lanys T'Vyl</I><p><B>You can use the ALT and UP or DOWN arrow keys in that view to raise or lower the height of the camera. This will allow you to position the camera where you need it to be able to see your character or not as the need arises.<p>Alan</B><p>I don't know about you, but the only times I use anything other than first person view is when I'm pulling something nasty or when I want to admire Moorgard's good looks. Damn, I'm a handsome munkie.<p>There was also some more <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000325.html">junk</a> on the upcoming roleplay--sorry, &quot;alignment&quot;--server.<p>On how NPCs will react to your alignment:<p><B>Alignments and factions are completely separate things. NPCs are not going to see, react to or have alignments. Alignments are only going to apply to player characters. We'll have more detail for you about the whole system once the server is set up for testing.</B><p>On the rebirth of trivial loot code and how it will affect quests:<p><B>You'll have to find someone of the 'appropriate' level to help you out. Keep in mind that very few items will be no-drop on this server. So if you 'need' an item from an NPC that is too low level for you to get it off the NPC yourself, you can hire some folks that are in that level range to get it for you. You become the wizened veteran that doesn't have time to do petty things and pays people to do them for you. This is a nice little side effect that I rather like.</B><p>We should probably be more excited about the advent of a roleplaying server. We really should. But we just can't be. Maybe it's because we don't have a lot of faith that the EQ engine can support a true roleplaying environment, despite the best alterations by Verant. Or maybe it's that we think Verant shouldn't be diverting its attention from Luclin right now--or at the very least, that they should be working on much-needed changes to the live servers.<p>Anyway, we'll keep reporting the pertinent news on the new server, just like we did for... for... oh hell, what was the name of that other server with the funny rules?<p>In non-EverQuest news, we are pleased to find that <a href="http://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</a> has addressed our recent national tragedy in its usual <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3734/hijackers_surprised.html">twisted</a> manner--while tempering their cynicism with some genuinely <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3734/woman_bakes_flag_cake.html">tender</a> moments.<p>No, what happened on September 11 wasn't funny in any way. But there it is, this 800-lb. gorilla, sitting on the couch with us and staring us down. We either let it squash us or we find some way to live with it. Laughter--and some rather <a href="http://www.theonion.com/onion3734/god_clarifies_dont_kill.html">poignant</a> moments--can help.
