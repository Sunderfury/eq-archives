<html><head><title>A Teaser About Nothing</title></head><body><h1>A Teaser About Nothing</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-04-16</p><BIG>Hart to Hart</BIG><p>Yesterday Absor <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1754607331">explained</a> how to get around the complete heal bug (you know, the one that makes warriors die and stuff). The whole things seemed a bit confusing, though, so we asked Scott Hartsman, EQ's tech guru, for some clarification on what caused the filtering problem:<p><B>During that megapatch we also introduced new types of spell filtering. Unfortunately, we gave the client the ability to filter out some of its own incoming damage/healing messages, leaving it only updated reliably once every six seconds or so.</B><p>Okay, that explains what causes the bug to happen. So does turning off the spell filtering force the client to update faster?<p><B>You got it -- It sends down an HP update with every spell that's hitting you.  Filter the spell, filter the HP update.  No one noticed it because it catches up 0-5 seconds later when the regular update tick comes along.</B><p>So the only way to ensure proper HP updates is to turn off all types of spell filtering. What this means is that you need to go into your Options menu and turn PC Spells, NPC Spells, Bard Songs, and Critical Spells all to &quot;On.&quot; Pay attention to that last part--<B>turning filtering off means that you have to set all the spell filters to &quot;On.&quot;</B><p>It makes sense when you think about it a minute, I swear.<p>The unfortunate thing is that there are times when you want to turn off NPC spells during high-end encounters. Doing so is the only way to avoid some ghosting effects of AoE spells that you actually resist, but get hit by anyway. Hopefully they'll get this bug fixed, too.<p>Since the CH bug really only gets warriors killed, we'd prefer the tech department take its time and get the fix right rather than rush it. On the other hand, warriors are handy to keep the mob busy while other classes kill it, and since that's the way I collect my ph4t l3wtz, it would be nice to have this bug go away.<p><BIG>The Balancing Act Continues</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000546.html">responded</a> to a level 22 (/boggle) player's concerns that the famous caster balancing is all done and, apparently, he doesn't feel uber enough:<p><B>I would hold off on believing any rumors about us being finished with the caster balance thing until you read about it here. Those EQ players just love to gossip! <p>And I'd argue pretty strongly against your words &quot;...few little changes we've seen to date...' Some rather significant ideas have already been introduced into the game.<p>This isn't exactly a simple process (despite what some pundits would have you believe). There are a lot of comparisons to make, much data to gather and plenty of ideas to toss out. It's just gonna take some time, so please be patient.</B><p>Why a level 22 feels unbalanced is frankly beyond me, but I guess since INT casters can't wear fungus tunics he needs some other way to hit 60 fast. For another chuckle you can check out the <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=15552.topic">response thread</a> over at Graffe's, where they are currently analyzing every syllable of Absor's post to find any hidden slight against wizards that might be present.  <p><BIG>In Case You Care About the Story...</BIG><p>Over at the Safehouse, Vaslin has just <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10723.topic



">released</a> version 4.0 of his Compendium. This excellent Windows help file contains information on game lore, quests, and various minutiae, and is fully searchable.<p>Vaslin does a heck of a job putting all of this together. I'm still bitter at him for allowing a gang of drunk Tarew Marr jerkoffs to cheat in a trivia contest and rob me of a Keith Parkinson sketch that I should have won back at Minneapolis FanFaire, but I promise to only hold a grudge for the next five years or so.<p>A pretty light news update this morning, but some days it's nice not to have a lot to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/04/15/super.antcolonies.ap/index.html">worry about</a>.<p>They'll be coming for us soon, you know...
