It has some interesting facts on the history of Verant, plus gives some insight into future products. Perhaps more interestingly, it actually gives some concrete financial numbers as to how well EverQuest is doing. For instance, it states that EQ has a 40% gross profit margin. Before you rant about how SOE makes too much money, please remember this is gross profit, not net, and compared to many consumer industries 40% isn't very high to begin with. Still, it's certainly a healthy number.<p>The story talks a lot about Star Wars: Galaxies, including a quote from a familiar face who happens to share my opinion of the upcoming title:<p><B>&quot;This will blow the market open like a supernova,&quot; says Brad McQuaid, EverQuest's co-designer.</B><p>Here are SOE's estimates on the success of SW:G, which I think are a little low:<p><B>But for now, Sony is confident that Star Wars Galaxies, which officially arrives in December, will eclipse all other worlds, even EverQuest. More than 139,000 players signed up for the beta test of the game, which Sony is building for LucasArts Entertainment in a revenue-sharing arrangement. Sony Online predicts that within the first three months, 500,000 people will buy the boxed Galaxies product and then begin paying an as-yet-unannounced monthly subscription fee.</B><p>Seriously, SW:G is going to be the biggest thing you've ever seen. (Note: I keep saying that and saying that so when it turns out to be true I will appear like I know what I'm talking about.)<p>The origin of EverQuest is given, along with some details I hadn't heard before:<p><B>So in 1996, Smedley pitched his boss at a Sony-owned PlayStation development studio on the idea of an online role-playing game. It would involve thousands of players at a time, he said. It would be three-dimensional. It would make a fortune. <p>Smedley recalls, &quot;I got three minutes into this huge presentation, and he just flat out said, 'No.'&quot; <p>But a few months later, a new boss, Kelly Flock, arrived. Smedley tried his pitch again. He pointed out that programmers at other companies were already working on virtual-world games like Meridian 59. And while he didn't know it at the time, Electronic Arts was already working on Ultima Online. He got the green light: EverQuest was a go. Smedley hired McQuaid and Steve Clover, two ace game programmers who were slaving as corporate systems administrators. Within three years, the small San Diego skunk works grew into a team of 56 developers and one of Sony's most expensive game projects, with a development budget approaching $5 million.</B><p>By comparison, EverQuest 2 is reported to have a budget of $20 million.<p>There are some numbers on SOE staffing as well:<p><B>The beauty of EverQuest, aside from its subscription model, is that players effectively pay to entertain each other. Sony just provides the playground: more than 1,000 computers in San Diego that have kept the game running since 1999. EverQuest also relies on 47 staffers to continually add items and quests to the game; another 128 &quot;game masters&quot; function as customer service reps and patrol the world answering questions.</B><p>Those who wonder why Verant keeps expanding the character transfer service need look no further than this tidbit:<p><B>But instead of simply load-balancing the number of players per computer, it allows fans to relocate their characters to different worlds on other servers -- for $50 a move. &quot;Would you believe we've generated over $1 million in revenue simply from moving characters?&quot; Smedley marvels.</B><p>As for future Verant MMORPG products, possibilities include the <I>Terminator</I> and Marvel Comics universes. Talks took place for a <I>Matrix</I>-inspired game, but it looks like Warner Brothers will be working on that instead.<p>The future certainly seems busy and bright for the ever-expanding MMORPG market. Reading this article does tend to give the impression that Sony is just out to dominate the industry and bleed every dollar they can out of you. And guess what--they are. They're a giant evil corporation, after all. But as long as the games are made and maintained by people who care about them, and as long as content is compelling and entertaining, and as long as elven chicks are hot, then I'll keep playing.<p>It's not like we can go back to checkers or tic-tac-toe, you know.<p><BIG>Avoiding the UI Patch Blues</BIG><p>Our regular spell parser guy, Remelio Gemweaver, posted a nice <a href="http://pub79.ezboard.com/ftranscendence39908frm31.showMessage?topicID=9.topic">tutorial</a> for implementing and maintaining a custom UI mod. In my last roundup I lamented that when UI files are updated in a patch, you need to manually copy the changed files over to your custom directory. Turns out this is not the case:<p><B>Please note, you only need the modified files in this new folder, not every file from the default directory - any missing file will be pulled automatically from the default directory - this is handy if they patch new files.</B><p>Most directions that I'd read for making custom UI mods involved copying the whole default directory, but it turns out you only need the files for whatever windows you modify. Having only the changed files in your custom directory will save you a lot of headaches when UI files are patched. Of course, if you are using a custom Hotkey window and they patch the default one, you will be in for a bit of tinkering, but Remelio's tip should save some of the hassle.<p><BIG>Nerf Paladins NOW!!!</BIG><p>I post this story in honor of Csenicier.<p>Paladins (as is the case with all hybrids) are much maligned. They're not quite warriors, not quite clerics; just somewhere inbetween, and some say not enough of either to be as useful as their parent classes.<p>The paladins themselves have a <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm13.showMessage?topicID=552.topic">different story</a>. Much as shamans proved their mettle by soloing a dragon in Western Wastes, now paladins are doing the same. The target of choice is Yeldema, a cousin of Lord Nagafen who admittedly isn't as potent as most of her kin. Still, soloing a dragon of any sort is worthy of note, especially when one is only using self buffs.<p>The downside of encounters like this is that they cheapen the game in a way. Dragons used to be the ultimate high-end mobs, but zones like Western Wastes and ToV have made many of them into jokes. Some things should just never become trivial, even though level cap increases plus new skills and equipment make that much more likely.<p>A member of my guild was in Lower Guk last night, leveling up a new character. They wondered aloud how that zone could ever have accommodated 80 players at once. Well, when the best-equipped people have 8/24 weapons, the content is challenging. When they have 15/20 weapons and a couple thousand more hitpoints, the story is very, very different.<p>Bah, enough of that downer stuff. Grats to the pallys who pulled this off. <p><BIG>SexHerQuest</BIG><p>A very involved and entertaining <a href="http://brentbates.com/~bates/EQ/quests/The_Brownie_Quest.html">quest</a> has been making the rounds lately, giving you your first (in-game) chance to copulate and produce offspring. It seems the brownies in Lesser Faydark are in need of a sire for a new generation, and you get to be the lucky donor.<p>Or you would be, if the quest was real. I must say, this is one of the best fakes posted in some time, as a lot of elements make sense--even the Tunare and Cazic-Thule part, since both those models do exist in LFay. The pic of the ogre with blonde hair is a bit of a stretch, of course, and let's not even talk about that interesting gnomish device.<p>Even though a quest like this would be fun, it's unlikely we'd see anything so... uh... carnal in a family game. So for now, I'm afraid all you brownie fans will just have to keep using your imagination.<p>You gotta admit, though... Treat is hot!
