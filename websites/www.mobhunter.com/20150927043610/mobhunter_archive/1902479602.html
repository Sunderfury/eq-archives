<html><head><title>Last Weekend of Sanity</title></head><body><h1>Last Weekend of Sanity</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-10-19</p><BIG>Just Change &quot;Slay&quot; to &quot;Get Slain By&quot;</BIG><p>Thought the hooplah raised by wizards, monks, and mages was bad? Wait til you see what happens when a roomful of dwarves in blue and gold armor get riled up.<p>In a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52353">post</a> on the EQ Live site, paladins were told about an upcoming change to their Slay Undead AA skill:<p><B>The issue is that there are no amount of AAs the warrior can buy to also raise his situational damage by such a large amount. This means that before AA, the paladin is always producing somewhat less damage than a warrior; and after AA the paladin is sometimes producing as much damage as a warrior at 60th level. This problem grows more noticeably in margin post 60 and becomes an increasing issue in Planes of Power.<br>...<br>We like the idea of this ability from a roleplaying and a gameplay standpoint. But it needs to be altered to make it more balanced. So we'll be making a change to Slay Undead and refunding the points for this AA ability on Monday.<p>NOTE: We've also changed the way that the refund works. Unspent AA points over 30 will only be deleted when you first zone after the patch. So you will have time to spend these points after you log in but before you zone. <p>We will be changing Slay Undead in two ways. <p>The ability will now be activated by a button. You will be able to turn it on and off as you see fit. The drawback is that using this ability requires the attention and intense focus of the Paladin. His intensity leaves him vulnerable to attacks, while inspiring the undead to greater strength. Strikes made against the Paladin using Slay Undead will do more damage than they usually do. Obviously this amount will vary dependent on all the factors that can affect combat (level, equipment and such), but we expect the amount of damage increase to be something near 15%.</B><p>Gee, think maybe <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=16922.topic">paladins are pissed</a>? That's a safe bet. And they have a few valid gripes, to say the least.<p>First off, a lot of them are saying that all the points they spent on the three levels of Combat Fury should be refunded as well, since a lot of them only bought that skill for the sake of Slay Undead. Since wizards and mages got similar refunds when manaburn and mod rods were nerfed, I think this is a very valid point.<p>Secondly, the way this refund is being handled is bogus. Paladins who end up with more than 30 stored AA points have to spend the excess points as soon as they log in and before they zone? What if they go linkdead? Crash? Seems like there are any number of issues that could cause the points to poof.<p>Finally, what is the real effect that this change will have? It is true that with Slay Undead in its current form, paladins can do <I>sick</I> damage against undead mobs. Get a bunch of well-equipped paladins on a raid against some of the undead in Ssra or Akheva, for example, and your eyes will pop at the crits they get. And certainly there are places that they can solo with this skill that gives them an advantage over other classes without undead-specific damage.<p>But who gets hurt by this change? Raids won't be affected really, since paladins aren't usually taking damage from the mobs (or at least they shouldn't be). Well-equipped soloers will be hurt a little, but paladins with uber weapons and lots of hitpoints--with some flowing thought mixed in--will be fine. The ones who really are at a disadvantage are the marginally equipped paladins who depend upon this skill to give themselves a steady flow of exp.<p>On the other hand, changes like this do make you think about about the advantages gained by AA skills as opposed to those gained through gear. What I mean is, it doesn't take any skill or challenge to acquire AA points--all it takes is time. Really good equipment, on the other hand, can only be obtained through the combined efforts and talents of a lot of people. From this perspective, gear should provide you bigger advantages than simply racking up AA points can give you. So is it fair that any paladin with run-of-the-mill stuff but with the right AA skills could solo better in some places than an uber warrior in the best gear? Then again, don't a lot of classes have situational advantages over others? Isn't that part of class balance?<p>These aren't easy questions to answer. But there are certainly arguments to be made both for and against this change. At the very least, it seems like there wouldn't be any harm in waiting a week or two after Planes of Power comes out so that paladins have a chance to burn off their stored AA points before this goes live.<p>Meanwhile, rangers everywhere are being quiet. Very, very quiet. Super-duper quiet, lest someone at Verant figures out how much damage they can do with their archery AA skills and nerfs the bejesus out of them.<p>Oh, did I just say that out loud? So sorry.<p><BIG>Druids Get Some Clarity</BIG><p>Speaking of nerfs, hard feelings linger over the change to manaburn. Not only on the part of wizards, however; some players are upset that manaburn squads are still alive and well, albeit with a somewhat shorter list of targets. Scott Hartsman stopped by the druid board to <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=29127.topic">address claims</a> that the change to manaburn didn't accomplish its goal:<p><B>Once again, that is the primary reason for the change to Mana Burn. Simply put, we couldn't develop an expansion that had fun high end encounters while this ability was left untouched.<p>A later paragraph in the same update reads: &quot;In addition to the problem described above.&quot; <p>&quot;In addition&quot; is supposed to further clarify that the &quot;Manaburn Team&quot; concept was the secondary reason for the change. As the author of that paragraph, I truly apologise if the meaning was not clear enough. If it was not, that is absolutely my fault.<p>Finally, at the previous Fan Faire, I absolutely did, in the Producers and Developers panel, make the following statement. (Which tends to make more sense when seen in its entirety.)<p>&quot;Right now, we have no intention of changing Mana Burn on anything other than potentially Red servers. At the moment, it isn't being a problem. If it proves to be a problem later, we'll address it then.&quot;<p>The unavoidable truth is: Situations change, and going into Planes of Power, it became a significant content balancing problem.<p>..and that, friend, is why the entire Development Update began with the statement, &quot;Just like everyone else, we're people. People make mistakes,&quot; and ended with an apology.<p>To summarize that three page letter into one considerably more brief sentence: <p>&quot;We made a mistake in our initial assessment of the skill, and we owe you an apology for that.&quot;<p>Which remains the absolute truth.</B><p>The fact is, we can't realize the full impact of the changes to manaburn (or mod rods, for that matter) since we don't know how their previous forms would have affected content in PoP. Too often in the past, content has been designed around character ability instead of player ingenuity. Hopefully PoP flips that around completely.<p><BIG>Who the Hell is Robert Pfister?</BIG><p>That's the question we asked ourselves after finding a <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/screenshots.asp?id=4202">GameSpy interview</a> with some guy claiming to work for Verant. Turns out Mr. Pfister (not to be confused with Mr. Mister, or Twisted Sister) has been a producer on EQ for a while now. He just doesn't get much press, and for some reason has never seen fit to send me e-mail or post on this site about how great Mobhunter is (gasp!). But being the generous folk we are, we will forgive Mr. Pfister (that's a great porn name, by the way) this oversight and allow him to enjoy his moment in the sun.<p>There were a couple points in the interview worth noting. Those of us happy to hear that PoP wouldn't focus on long, arduous key quests were made nervous by this part:<p><B>GameSpy: Are certain portals to special areas within the planes locked by quest flags? In other words do you need to be on a special quest to unlock them?<p>Robert: While I won't go into details on the quests for PoP (part of the fun is the discovery!), questing is the key (get it?). As you progress through the storyline you'll also continue development of your character by gaining experience, alternate advancement abilities and new items. It's our hope this progression will feel more natural as you play.</B><p>Another interesting thing was what he said about raid exp:<p><B>New multi-grouping system (raids) that allows up to 60 players to team together New quest system that allows unprecedented depths of gameplay</B><p>Maybe I'm a dork (don't you dare say anything!), but I never noticed a 60-person limit mentioned before. I guess huge guilds will have to find another way to split up raid exp. Poor zerglings.<p>Thanks for the interview, Mr. Pfister. You now officially have my favorite Verant employee name.<p><BIG>The Countdown Has Begun. Literally.</BIG><p>They say a watched pot never boils. If this is true, don't look at the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/index.jsp">Planes of Power site</a>, because if you do then it will never get released. A timer lists exactly how long it will be until you can (in theory) purchase and enter the homes of the gods.<p>Also available is a pretty snazzy <a href="ftp://eqftp.station.sony.com/popmovie.zip">Quicktime movie<a/> that shows some battles and other delights. No, it doesn't explain what the hell all those prologues were about, but did you really expect it to?<p><BIG>48 Better Things to Watch on TV</BIG><p>No, I didn't watch the <I>48 Hours</I> segment. It was on opposite <I>Firefly,</I> so that took care of it for me. I did, however, watch some Canadian variation of the same thing that's <a href="http://cbc.ca/consumers/market/media/everquest_qt_021015.html">available on the Net</a>, so I have a pretty good idea of what was said. The Canadian one was probably worse, really, since we all know that Canadians are treacherous and evil.<p><I>Entertainment Tonight</I> (one of the most sickly addictive guilty pleasures on television, by the way) gave an encapsulated version of the story, complete with the suicide guy's mother crying and cursing the game. They called it &quot;Hollywood's newest addiction&quot; in their typical (but oh so compelling!) pseudo-news style.<p>My thoughts on this issue remain the same. EverQuest, like many things in the world, has the potential to be addictive. It can't, however, make you kill yourself. It takes other severe personal problems for that to happen. It's natural for those left behind after a suicide to try and find something to blame, but in this case the mother is pointing the finger in the wrong direction. Nuff said.<p><BIG>Ye Gods!</BIG><p>For those of you following Verant's little game where you were supposed to guess the identity of three gods based upon pictures and clues, here are the obvious answers:<p><B>God #1 - <a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Terris_Thule_03.jpg">Terris-Thule</a> <br>Terris-Thule is known as the Dream Scorcher or the Nightmare, for her effect on the sleep of dreamers. She rules the Demi-plane of Nightmares and delights in torturing the innocent as they rest. She is tall, well over six feet in height and skeletally thin. Her skin is pale with hints of gray. Long, black fingernails extend from her bony hands, to match her slinky gown. Her face is smooth - no features mar its sleek surface other than two empty black eye sockets. Long black hair flows back from two massive brass horns at her temples.<p>God #2 - <a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Mith_Marr_01.jpg">Mithaniel Marr</a><br>Mithaniel Marr, the Truthbringer, governs the Plane of Valor. Mithaniel is the ultimate paladin who wears a full suit of shining silver plate armor and wields a glowing longsword. Mithaniel Marr, who owes his existence to Tarew Marr, leader of the Triumvirate of Water, is allied with Erollisi Marr and Karana. He counts Innoruuk, Cazic-Thule, and Bertoxxulous among his enemies. He has a friendly rivalry with Solusek Ro.<p>God #3 - <a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Karana_02.jpg">Karana</a><br>Karana is allied with Tunare and Mithaniel Marr. Bertoxxulous is his enemy. Followers of Karana, the Rainkeeper, believe in the absolute power of storms. They worship the life-giving power of the rain and respect the destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane. Typical followers of Karana are rural humanoids - farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer strangers shelter from the elements. Many of Karana's followers live a nomadic lifestyle, travelling where the winds take them. They are humble, generous people who value strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana or of his work for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.</B><p>Verant also sent some pretty slick screens of other mobs and one of the planes, which are linked for you below.<p><TABLE border="0" cellpadding="2"><TR><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Phoenix_02.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Phoenix_02s.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Plane_of_Air_01.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Plane_of_Air_01s.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Storm_rider.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Storm_rider-s.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Taarid_01.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Taarid_01s.jpg"></a></TD></TR></TABLE><p>Those are some very impressive shots. Notice how Plane of Air looks a lot like Plane of Sky, but with connecting bridges and mobs that are about ten times cooler looking. Let's hope the zone isn't saddled with lame quests like its predecessor. You can read more about some of these places on the updated <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/planes.jsp">planes page</a>.<p><BIG>A Quiet Little Nerf</BIG><p>I've played quite a bit in the revamped Temple of Cazic-Thule. Spots have great loot, and the experience that a good group can get there simply can't be beat. Or at least, it couldn't.<p>One of the patches last week made a rather significant change to the experience modifier in the zone. Killing the same mobs as we did before, it soon became clear to my group that our exp was climbing at a much slower rate than normal. Using a custom UI with percent values, there was absolutely no doubt that the amount of exp per kill is much lower now.<p>This is a very bad move. The new CT was one of the best-balanced in the game for risk versus reward. It takes skilled players to succeed there, and death is always a very real possibility--but the excellent experience gains were worth the effort to obtain them. But now, with exp on par to a much easier zone like Akheva, only the loot camps in CT become worthwhile. This is a bad move.<p>Maybe high-level players will have access to a lot more exp spots in PoP--in theory, at least. But there still need to be other options, and CT was really one of the few. Hopefully this gets changed back and players will once again benefit from taking risks in a tough zone. That's the way the game is supposed to be.
