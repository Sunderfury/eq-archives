I know how it is to come to a site that you like and not see anything new. It's sort of a bummer.<p>So to provide you with something resembling entertainment, I will continue to rip off one of my bored guildmates to show you something <a href="http://www.stupid.ch/">stupid</a>. Hey, I warned you. Also, see what the <a href="http://www.toshistation.com/wookie.htm">wookies</a> are up to. And if you can peel yourself away from the keyboard for about four hours, go rent a <a href="http://www.otnemem.com/">movie</a>. It's only two hours long, but you're going to want to watch it twice... at least.<p>I'm sure some EQ news will show up sometime, but at least until December gets a little closer, fantasy football is probably going to be more entertaining.
