Having your armor look like any armor set you want instead of X armor I would pay a bit for or something along those lines... but again nothing that gave a player a item advantage over another.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[SOE has to make some money, this is the aim of a company but the station cash is &quot;too much&quot;.
The players give their fee each month so an item shop is a bit excessive in this case. I suppose that others companies will keep an eye on the station cash and will do the same thing if it&#039;s finally a success.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t miss it either.  It&#039;s ridicules, and depressing. As much as I would love working there, some of these decisions might drive me through the wall.  Hard to be a long term fan (since 99), watching some of this stuff.  

I&#039;m pretty much done with EQII until EQ3 (pending it&#039;s not playing with the goofy cool-aid), or until somebody new brings a realistic fantasy game with a great deal of choice.]]></description>

Even though we don&#039;t play EQ2 anymore -_-

Perhaps you&#039;d like to come be the Sodality Community manager? We could pretend to be upset about things and you could soothe our fears?]]></description>

For myself, I don&#039;t know the details of the items available yet, but so long as they&#039;re &quot;fluff&quot; and garbage things like XP potions, and not something like fabled weapons/armor/jewelry, then I don&#039;t have a problem with it.]]></description>
