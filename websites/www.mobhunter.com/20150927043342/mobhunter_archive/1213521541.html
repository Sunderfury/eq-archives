The estimated downtime is 10 hours.</B><p>That's a pretty hefty downtime. What's in the works? The bard buff box seems likely, and maybe the changes to the character data format--hopefully without toons poofing like they did on Test, of course.<p>Other possibilities include a <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=12557.topic">change to Bastion of Thunder</a> to prevent enchanters from sploi--er, soloing boss mobs there, and hopefully a fix to Plane of Innovation to <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=12605.topic">make the Magnetic Behemoth spawn again</a>. We'll have to wait until Thursday to find out for sure, I guess.<p><BIG>Better to Burn Out Than Fade Away</BIG><p>The latest ubermob to pay the debt which cancels all others is that flaming tyrant himself, Fennin Ro. This time the honors go to those wacky Legends subscribers in <a href="http://www.townrebels.org/">Township Rebellion</a>.<p>The loot is pretty darn spiffy (though not <I>that</I> extraordinary), and the Essence of Fire thingy might be part of a quest to enter the Plane of Time. We'll know more when some of the other elemental bosses die.<p>Kudos to TR on the kill. Legends subscribers take a lot of heat from people who say they are spoon-fed content by SOE, but those who have seen the elder Mr. Ro firsthand agree that the kill is worthy of praise regardless of who did it first.<p><BIG>Two Hands to Hold You</BIG><p>For those classes who are fond of two-handed weapons, Kreugen over at the FoH board points out <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=670272ca8244f674f69c002be6b677df&amp;threadid=4857">some problems with two-handers in PoP</a>. <p>In an effort to make newer weapons more effective than older ones, the designers of many PoP two-handers lowered the delay as compared to upper-end Velious and Luclin drops. In theory that's great, but they seem to have forgotten that to get the improved damage bonus that was intended to make two-handers more balanced, the delay on the weapon has to be above 28. Many PoP drops are faster than that, meaning they have weak damage bonuses that render the weapons useless. Certainly a matter that is worth fixing.<p>. . .<p>Okay, I'll grant you that we really had to stretch the boundaries of newsworthiness to bring you this update. To make it up to you, here's a little bonus gem--possibly <a href="http://www.hackersquest.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=1334&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0">the dumbest person to ever play EverQuest</a>. He's certainly in the running, anyway. So if you gained nothing else by reading this piece, hopefully you at least walk away with a giggle. The stupidity of others is always amusing.
