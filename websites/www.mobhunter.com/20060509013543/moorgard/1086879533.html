The promotion offers EverQuest fans bonus months of free online gameplay with either EverQuest Trilogy, including the original EverQuest and two expansion packs, or the most ambitious expansion pack to date, EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin(TM) when they purchase any Gateway desktop PC with an Intel Pentium 4 processor.  The promotion will be available online at <a href="http://www.everquest.com">www.everquest.com</a>, <a href="http://www.gateway.com">www.gateway.com</a>, Gateway stores and 1-800-GATEWAY. <p>&quot;With technologies continuing to expand and gamers demanding more out of their computer systems, we have teamed up with two leaders in the computer industry to deliver a system that answers all of these demands and more,&quot; said Scott McDaniel, vice president of marketing, Sony Online Entertainment.  &quot;Utilizing some of today's most advanced computer technologies and the rich new expansion pack The Shadows of Luclin, gamers now have the best in online gameplay and technology right at their fingertips.&quot;<br>Gateway PC's, featuring the Intel&reg; Pentium 4 processor, provide the best possible performance for playing the recently launched EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, offering both higher frame rates and smoother animation, to ultimately deliver a richer, more complete role-playing experience.</B><p>There's more, but you get the idea.<p>Prices on these babies range from $799 (for a 1.6 gHz P4 with an anemic 128 MB of RAM and a measly 20 gig HD) to $2999 (for a 2.2 gHz P4 with a gig of RAM, 120 gig HD, and an 18.1&quot; LCD flatscreen). Interestingly, the high-end machine uses an ATI Radeon 8500 card rather than a GeForce 3 Ti500--so much for the notion of Verant and nVidia being chained at the hip. You do get three free months of EverQuest if you're already a subscriber when you buy one of the computers, or the EQ Trilogy and two free months if you aren't already a subscriber.<p>So will these new PCs really make Luclin a better experience for you? Sorry, but there's no magic bullet here. Gateway doesn't get better Pentium 4 chips or secret prototype video cards. More likely, this partnership is just a move to boost Gateway's <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-803782.html">failing stock prices</a>. For the amount these guys are charging, you can build a better machine on your own.<p>Of course, there is one point in all of this that we must sadly concede to Gateway: as of this writing, if you want the best Luclin experience possible, you must buy a Pentium 4 system. While AMD's processors are a better value and a superior performer, the fact is that Umbra still isn't working on the Athlon. Until it is, we'd be remiss to recommend building an AMD system right now.<p>And believe me, saying that bugs me just as much as it bothers you to read it.<p><BIG>The Gnoll Knows</BIG><p>That scourge of Qeynos, Fippy Darkpaw, <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/featured_content/fippyfacts/">returned</a> after a long absence with another edition of Fippy's Facts. This time around, the cranky furball reports stats on the Vah'Shir:<p><B>Total number of Vah Shir player characters: 208,591<br>Percent of total Vah Shir who are Beastlords: 80%<br>Percent of total Vah Shir who are other classes: 20%</B><p>and horses:<p><B>Horses by color: <br>Tan  10% <br>White  30% <br>Black  52% <br>Brown 8% <p>Horses by armor type:<br>Rope 73% <br>Leather  11% <br>Silken  3% <br>Chain 12% <br>Ornate Chain 1%</B><p>That rope horse costs about 9K, by the way. A waste of money, if you ask me, when JBoots and Run Speed 3 are free. But I shouldn't rag on horses too much; they don't annoy me nearly as much as those stupid familiars that wizards all have flapping around.<p><BIG>Cleric Whines Pay Off</BIG><p>Absor made a surprise <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000465.html">announcement</a> on Dev Corner today.<p><B>Normally this isn't something I'd do. But, well, I'm going to outline the changes we're making to this quest in rather close detail. But first, let me try to explain the concern that players had with this quest.<p>With arguably the most popular Epic Quest item, the Cleric trying to gain his Epic item usually finds plenty of people to help in the process. Clerics are commonly the first in line with guilds to help with their epic quests. So Clerics tend to get further in their epic quest faster than many others. This has lead to a very nasty 'bottleneck' for Clerics trying to complete the quest. The Ragefire portion of the quest has been creating a lot of static among players.<p>So we have decided to make a change to the end portion of this quest. To reduce confusion and to help people understand why we're making this change, I'm going to give out a few specific details. These changes will go Live with the patch tonight.</B><p>We'll leave out the spoiler details, just in case the three people who actually want to figure out the new quest portion for themselves might be reading.<p>This change is a bit of a surprise, as begging for epic changes seemed like beating a dead horse (all apologies to Fippy). I guess it just goes to prove that Verant does keep these issues in mind, even if they don't immediately act in the way the player wants them to.<p>Wait, that sounded too nice. Is Moorgard kissing Verant's ass again? Is he looking for a job? I mean, what's next... is he gonna say Verant is listening to necros, too?<p><BIG>Verant Listens to Necros</BIG><p>What's more, Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000463.html">responded</a> to them. At length. In fact, at such great length that I'm not going to quote it here, because most of the answers are &quot;I'll mention it to the team&quot; and &quot;that is working as intended.&quot;<p>Necros, as you'd imagine, have their <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forumsnew/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=9562&amp;FORUM_ID=1&amp;CAT_ID=1&amp;Topic_Title=Verant+Replies%2E%2E%2ESort+Of&amp;Forum_Title=General+Discussions">own ideas</a> about that. My favorite quote from the thread: &quot;Has this guy even played EQ?&quot;<p>Hey, at least Absor responded, right? That's half the battle. Necros are on the road back to uberdom... I can feel it!<p>I can also feel the hate mail from necros starting to pour in. Good thing I have all those shaman buffs...<p><BIG>And Speaking of Horses...</BIG><p>Why do they cost so damn much, anyway? Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000462.html">lets us know</a>:<p><B>Horses are a status symbol. Regardless of what the relative cost of a horse to a magic sword would be in our world, on Norrath (Luclin, actually), horses are a rare and expensive item. They are a luxury item that only the rich and semi-rich can afford, but that only the very rich would buy. Yes, most people would rather purchase a powerful magic sword or some armor to turn someone else's magical sword. And that's the reason that horses are so expensive, because they are very rare, and because they are a status symbol that the very rich are willing to pay for.<p>As for reselling horses, we are looking into that. The current plan is to allow them to be sold back at a slight loss.</B><p>We already <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-357535037">reported</a> that a stablehand has appeared on Test server who offers to buy back your bridle at a slight loss. I guess, like many retail stores these days, the Bazaar is instituting a restocking fee.<p><BIG>I Lost My Towels, and Verant Ain't Giving 'Em Back</BIG><p>I've been lamenting for a while now the loss of Velious armors with the release of Luclin--in fact, it made my &quot;what's still wrong with Luclin&quot; <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-743524237">list</a>. Finally someone at Verant has responded to this issue... but it wasn't Absor. Someone named Justin Almond made a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/019756.html">post</a> in that nutty Technical Help forum:<p><B>Because of the new character models, we were unable to include the Velious armor graphics as the unique armors they were. The memory requirements to add these armors would have increased the system requirements even more and would have been unfeasible.<br> <br>Adding the armors in the future is a possibility and something we are looking at but for now, if you want to see the Velious armors as unique, you will have to remove all Shadows of Luclin character models.</B><p>The answer isn't unexpected, but it stinks nonetheless (and the word is &quot;infeasible,&quot; by the way). The net result is that we only get one plate, one chain, and one leather armor per race, plus a few variants and special cases (like monk armor). That is, until Verant raises the minimum system requirements to 2 gigs of RAM.<p>Verant better get busy and fix the armor tinting issue, because as it stands we have an awful lot of players who look exactly the same, despite the fact that they have vastly different types of armor.<p><BIG>The End, at Last</BIG><p>To wrap up this mother of all News Roundups, Absor passed on a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000464.html">special message</a> for EQ players who live in Riverside and San Bernardino.<p>I don't live in either of those places, so I'm not going to post the text here. If you do, go read the message.<p>How's that for concise reporting?
