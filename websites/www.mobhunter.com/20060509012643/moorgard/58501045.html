Players will be able to purchase a horse of their own in designated locations and will be able to summon their horse with the aid of a magical whistle. Players will be able to traverse greater distances in shorter periods of time and even battle from their mounts.</B><p>Blah, blah, blah. Press releases suck.<p>Anyway, the new shots look good. It's hard to tell if the player models have changed much, but the human does look a little better--albeit naked.<p>It seems the debate as to whether horses will be good for the game is moot; the game will have them. Now it's only a matter of making sure the steeds function as intended, while not wasting development time that is better spent on more worthwhile content.
