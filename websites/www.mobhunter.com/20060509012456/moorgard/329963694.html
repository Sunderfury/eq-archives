<html><head><title>Goodbye to a Legend</title></head><body><h1>Goodbye to a Legend</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-08-19</p>There is a long and busy <a href="http://www.noows.com/showthread.php?s=1a75dd2379ba9047e522fccd48c5f794&amp;threadid=3063">thread</a> on the Fires of Heaven board full of heartfelt goodbyes to one of the most famous/infamous players to ever enter the world of Norrath, Furor Planedefiler.<p>Below are some pertinent excerpts from his farewell.<p><B>I have had an amazing and awesome time playing Everquest. The people I loved, the people I despised, the people I met and knew, were all special to me in one way or another. The stories I could tell, the stories that I will always hold inside, and the stories I shared all hold such a great meaning for me. I will not go into my persnal life, but I will admit that Everquest helped me greatly in a time that I needed to be helped. I hope that in all my adventures, I helped Everquest become a better world.<p>...<p>I'd also like to point out to some of you old jaded players - don't ever assume that VI doesn't play this game at the level you play. I have had the privilege of playing alongside legends and the blindness to never realize it... <p>...<p>Thank you Brad for the vision. Smed for being an incredible ass (don't fuck with this guy, ever - he's dead on and god damned smart). Ryan Palacio wherever you may now be - pure genius... Roger, the greatest, most powerful destroyer of Frogloks and Crocs/Gaters that I ever knew; Daegarmo, well, you kick ass.... Narris, I can STILL drink you under; Kendrick, the man who started it all for me and a devout follower of the Palacio way! GG Primal weapons  Breen.... basically, the man - FEAR letting this guy create a game of his own.... Abashi... haha.. we won't go there but you own in your own SPECIAL way  and the rest of the pure ownage that is the development and design team. Customer Service... you fucking suck, badly... sorry, it's true</B><p>As noted by Kreugen, Furor is retiring from online gaming entirely, and will not be moving to <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/">Dark Age of Camelot</a>, <a href="http://www.anarchyonline.com/">Anarchy Online</a>, or anything else.<p>While Furor has not always been the best-loved player in the game, no one can deny his skill at leading one of the most powerful guilds to ever venture into EverQuest.<p>The staff of Mobhunter sends a big thank-you to Furor for all the enjoyment he's provided, and wishes Alex the best in that scary place known as real life.<p>We are sure Fires of Heaven will continue to kick ass and take names, even without Furor.
