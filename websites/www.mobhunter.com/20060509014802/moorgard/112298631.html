Initially verant had planned that these zones would need new spell effects/items in order to breath; however, it has since been changed in order to easy exploration and use of these zones that EB/DMF will instead be all thats needed in order to breath and operate within.<p>Some more spell info:<p>Bards:<p>- Valshire confirmed bards will be the only class able to increase the haste cap beyond it's current setting of 100%, by approx 15-25% (bards songs were not finalized yet so he just threw out likely numbers). This is due to verant *vision* that in order to have max haste possible a player should have all 3 sources of haste: item, spell, bard song. Also he confirmed these haste capping songs will be newly introduced and that current songs will not break the haste cap (sorry Melody of Ervaj still = useless) <br>- AE resistant songs will be made, but they will not have an enormous AoE so that large raids will not be able to depend on only 1 bard to resistance buff everyone attending said raid. <br>- Bards will get a selo's type song (probably at 49/50ish) with a long duration (2.5 minutes i believe he said) in order to easy large zone travel so bards do not need to worry as much about keeping everyone constantly in range for traveling.<p>Beastlord:<p>- Beast lord pet appearance will vary by race: Troll - alligator, Ogre - black bear, Barbarian - white wolf, Iksar - scaled wolf, Vah Sir - tiger.<p>Clerics:<p>- Not really much discussion, however in the future Valshire expressed a desire to add 1 more resist type (energy) to give classes such as clerics and possibly mages more ability to land DD spells on mobs especially at higher levels. This will NOT be in place for Luclin.<p>Druids:<p>- Not much of anything said... a little complaining from some people about the group hp series currently planned for sub-50 but Valshire explained these were made to make druids more group friendly it still leaves Clerics as the best group buffers/healers.<br>- also Life Shield will be replaced as it has been all but finalized that EB/DMF type items will work in vacuum zones *see Zones section*<p>Enchanter:<p>- aggro effecting spells work like the following: when you have the aggro buffer, when a melee hit generates aggro, the buff multiplies the aggro created by a percentage and that becomes the new aggro. the aggro reducer operates the same way, just that it reduces amount of aggro generated. these effects DO NOT simply add an amount of aggro to each action that generates aggro.<p>Example calculations: <br>With a 35% aggro enhancer buff, a melee hit/spell affect that would normally produce 100 points of aggro will now generate 135 points of aggro. With a 25% aggro reducer buff, a melee hit/spell affect that would normally produce 80 points of aggro will  now only generate 60 points of aggro. As far as what percentages the spell effects will have is yet to be determined.<p>Mages:<br>- a lot like druids, not all to much talked about. Confirming with the recent changes to resists magicians should now be able to land spells much more frequently in high end encounters like NToV and that Summon Elemental Blanket will be taken out *see Zones section*<br>- was some minor talk about pets, not much planned to change, he did mention they felt Epic pet was somewhat overpowered but they have no plans on nerfing it.<p>Necromancers:<p>- Valshire expressed interest in possibly making an upgrade to Screaming Terror and confirmed that there will be no more spells in the essence emerald line.<br>- Also like Mages, the roll for necromancers should now be expanded in high end encounters with the recent resist changes as verant never wanted their roll to just be mana batteries in the high end game.<p>Paladins:<p>- Paladins will become the only class in game that will be able to spell cast stun mobs 55-60. Races such as Frost and Storm Giants however, will still be immune to stun as it's a racial ability.<p>Shamans:<p>- Verant will probably not be changing spells drop rates any more on spells like Malo, Torpors, Pox. <p>Shadow Knights:<p>- Shadow Knights target debuff/syphon skills type spells will stack with the necromancers skills. EX (numbers are just used as examples): a syphon ability will take away 25 points from the targets ability score and will add 25 points to each member of that sk's party<p>Wizard:<p>- reiteration on wizard familiar. the familiar CANNOT gain aggro, the familiar will always auto-follow and cannot be given ANY commands to do otherwise, the familiar will always grant the wizards it's abilities no matter the range between the 2 (yes the familiar will fall behind if the wizard has sow and the familiar doesn't), the familiar CAN be buffed but other then AEs they can not take damage, there will be some method to make (probably only the highest lvl familiars) immues to AE, familiars will last (not set in stone) 10 RL in game hours and will zone/camp out/port with the wizard.<br>- Harvest will probably not but made into a series since higher end familiars will aid in mana regen.<p>Spell drops:<p>- Valshire very much liked the idea of specific encounters to gain high end spells such as the The Korucost in Chardok for the Necro Group DMF and would like to do more of this in the future.</B><p>This is the first concise explanation of the enchanter's aggro-affecting spells. I must say, I'm skeptical of these things going live. If the enchanter can keep that much aggro on the main tank, many, many encounters will be trivialized. There will have to be some hefty checks and balances put into place, methinks. On the plus side, enchanters will be very busy throughout big fights. Be careful what you wish for, chanters!<p><B>*** Updated 4:30 PM CST ***</B><p>Duran had <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=fc38e82ad67cf428ff11135eb82aeb10&amp;threadid=32004">more</a> to say about FanFaire over at the Ranger Glade message board. Highlights include:<p>- Jeff Butler reports that melee are now balanced, so don't expect any more major changes.<p>- They may not be done tinkering with cleric aggro (unless, of course, they were jokingly taunting the poor clerics in attendance).<p>- The fourth warder, once dead, will remain so. Rumors of a quest to return the Sleeper to his tomb may be exaggerated.<p>- Veeshan's Peak will be revamped. Get back to camping those key parts!<p>- Verant wants to know what you like about DAoC so that they can rip it o... er, make EQ better.<p>Once again, we'll provide more steaming hot logs of news as they become available.
