<html><head><title>Dissecting the Patch</title></head><body><h1>Dissecting the Patch</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-09-12</p>The <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=976259472">patch message</a> gave its usual breakdown of the changes made to the game, though there are typically a few loose threads that turn up and need to be re-examined.<p>The disappearance of the server population numbers will continue to be debated for a while. Personally, it's not that big a deal for me. I used the number chiefly to determine whether my linkdeath was a server problem or something caused on my end. Verant has decided they want to keep the population data secret, and I'm not going to waste time arguing with them about it.<p>Absor noted that a few items have received <a href="">stealth changes</a> to their appearance. <a href="http://eq.gameznet.com/equipment/bootsofthevindicator.html">Boots of the Vindicator</a> were the first item mentioned, but I'm going to check my bank to see if I can come up with anything else. Why is it that the monk epic gloves <I>still</I> don't have a graphic?<p>Monks are <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=14384.topic">mostly happy</a> with the fix to the feign death bug, though there's always a few that swear something else is broken. Name a class that doesn't jump to those conclusions after a patch. At times, it's even justified (see below). In any case, it's great that such a long-standing and crippling bug has been addressed by Verant. For those who don't know what this bug was all about, it made using the feign death skill while grouped with other players who were on the mob's hate list impossible to do. Fixing this bug will save many monkey lives.<p>Shamans probably got pretty nervous when it was mentioned that their epic effect was going to be &quot;fixed,&quot; and sure enough, Verant managed to introduce a new bug. However, the results may not be all bad. As was <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000308.html">noted</a> by one shaman, the epic effect was changed from a DoT spell to a HoT--heal over time. While you don't want to be casting this on NPCs you are fighting, casting a 1300 HP heal to your groupmate is a nice thing. <B>Problem:</B> you can only cast the epic effect on someone you are fighting, so healing a groupmate won't work. <B>Solution:</B> /duel that groupmate first, then heal to your heart's content. In any case, the bug will be fixed with the next patch, when shamans can get all freaky nasty again.<p>Speaking of nasty, necromancers now have a pet that is immune to fear--high level necros, anyway. Most are <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forumsnew/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=7044&amp;FORUM_ID=1&amp;CAT_ID=1&amp;Topic_Title=SPEC+PET+IMMUNE+TO+FEAR%21&amp;Forum_Title=General+Discussions">pleased</a>, though this class is so used to abuse that, like a victim of battery, they are waiting for the other shoe to drop... across their collective backside.<p>No word from enchanters yet on the &quot;fix&quot; to their mesmerize line. Hopefully things are <B>working as intended (TM).</B><p>Finally, some quest components have apparently been exempted from the trivial loot code found in the Warrens and Stonebrunt Mountains. It's not known yet exactly which components have been affected, or what criteria Verant used to determine which should be. Let the farming commence. You might end up with some pretty <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/mintzy/newitems.html">fancy</a> stuff.<p>
