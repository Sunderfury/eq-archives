Seems she was too eager to give out a nice cloak upon proof of the death of Zlandicar. Verant still hasn't seen fit to return her to her roaming ways.<p>As of last night, the guardian of the Temple of Veeshan--Sontalak--and his first brood kinsman, Klandicar, are taking dirt naps on all servers thanks to the GM staff.<p>The rumor is that there was something about the nasty area of effect spells that these guys cast that was causing Western Wastes to crash. GMs went around on all servers and killed these two tough dragons and replaced them with naked human counterparts (!Sontalak and !Klandicar).<p>Rumors abound that they will be fixed soon, so don't look for conspiracies yet. If Verant feels like returning Klandicar to his previous state of being a pantywaste, they should feel free.<p>Until then, we'll keep our eyes on the western skies.
