				<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>Moorgard is the pseudonym of Steve Danuser&#8211;that&#8217;s me. I currently work in video game design at <a title="My job." href="http://www.38studios.com" target="_blank">38 Studios</a> on an unannounced MMOG. Prior to that, I worked on <em>EverQuest II</em> and its expansions.</p>
<p>I got into this business mostly by accident. Having played computer RPGs such as the <em>Ultima </em>series ever since I got my first Atari 800 computer, I eventually found my way to the original <em>EverQuest</em>. Some friends and I started an opinion site called <a href="http://mobhunter.com/">Mobhunter</a>, which built up something of a following. After getting to know a number of the game&#8217;s devs, I was invited to interview for the community manager position on EQ2. It was my good fortune to be hired and to serve as one of the leads on the EQ2 project.</p>
<p>I spent about two years in that position before transitioning full time into game design. That covers everything from designing zones, to making quests, to assigning appearances to armor. I also, on occasion, wrote a post or two.</p>
<p>After completing my work on the <em>Echoes of Faydwer</em> expansion, I left SOE and accepted a position with Green Monster Games (which became 38 Studios) in Maynard, MA.</p>
<p>I made this site as a place I could post observations and generate discussion. It&#8217;s a big web out there, and this is my little corner of it.</p>
<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ll find the rest of my writing to be more amusing than this page. Good luck.</p>
<p>I can be reached via email: <strong>moorgard</strong> (<strong>at) moorgard (dot) com</strong>.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have many talents in life, but chief among them is being able to blend disparate nonsense into something a tiny group of people will find vaguely interesting.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>This site expresses my personal views, not those of my employer or coworkers. The articles here don&#8217;t represent the opinions of anyone other than me, so don&#8217;t try to attribute what I say to any company I happen to work for. <em>These postings are mine alone, have not been reviewed or approved by my employer (&#8221;38 Studios, LLC&#8221;), and do not necessarily express the views of my employer.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be maintaining this site from home in my spare time, so you don&#8217;t have to worry that my writing here is taking away from balancing your class or fixing your most-hated bug.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, the purpose of this site isn&#8217;t for me to answer questions about the game I work on or the company I work for. While inevitably my articles will refer to the project I&#8217;m working on in various ways, I&#8217;m not going to reveal any secrets or post any details on the game that I wouldn&#8217;t answer on the official forums.</p>
<p>Comments that readers make to any of my articles should be attributed to whoever makes them. I don&#8217;t plan to censor anybody, unless I decide that I hate you.</p>
<p>Basically, life is too short to get bent out of shape about what you read online. And please remember, nobody ever proved they were smarter than someone else by making a post on the Internet.</p>
