In order to help our players avoid these scams, we're taking action in the patch on Tuesday. We first considered popping up a confirmation box when attempting to drop coin on the ground, however upon reflection we could not determine a reason why anyone would want to do this, except perhaps when attempting to &quot;self-trade&quot; items and coin between characters. However dropping things on the ground is as you can imagine an extremely unsafe and unsupported way to trade items, and has created more headaches for players and our CS staff than it has done them good. <p>To that end, beginning on Tuesday the dropping of coinage will no longer be allowed by the client. Players will of course still be able to destroy it if they wish, for instance, to releave themselves of unwanted copper.<p>We look forward to hearing your comments. If there are any reasons that dropping coinage should be allowed that we haven't thought of, please reply and let us know.</B><p>Okay, here's a comment. (I could send it to the Dev Corner board, but then I'd never know if anyone actually read it. By posting it here, I'm at least guaranteed that Kohath, Csenicier, and Furor will read it, so I can feel a bit of satisfaction in that.)<p>This is a lousy change for at least one class: monks. See, we have this lame weight limit that's still a pain in the ass, despite a bit of breathing room given to us by Verant over the past couple of years. Even with a weight limit of 24 at level 60, we're still forced to contend with enough heavy armor and weapons that looting coins can be a hassle sometimes. I can't tell you how many times a day I drop coins on the ground to keep myself under the weight limit.<p>Why not just destroy them? Because, like any sane person, I have the option set to ask for confirmation before I destroy something. That means an extra mouse click, and if you do it as often as a monk does, it adds up to a lot of hassle. So I just drop unwanted coin on the ground instead, which doesn't require a confirmation. Also, you can write your name with coins if you're artistically inclined.<p>I can hear all the boo-hoos from the peanut gallery now. &quot;Poor Moorgard has to click his mouse a few more times... big deal.&quot; But you don't understand how sadistic my guildmates will be about this.<p>These creeps will be changing their plats to coppers at the bank just so they can group with me and type /split 0 0 0 5000. Groupchat will be filled with &quot;BAHAHAHAHAHAHA&quot; about eight times a night because some lame ranger with a Ted Nugent fetish thinks he's clever by doing this over and over and over again.<p>So please, Verant, don't make a change that would only benefit the braindead few in GFay and EC who don't understand how a trade works. If you do, at least add in the functionality that destroying coins NEVER asks for a confirmation. And if you really want to do monks a favor, add an option that allows players to specify which types of coins they want to loot, and make it work for the /split command, too. I'd suggest removing the monk weight limit completely, but after two and a half years of monkhood I know better.<p>In any case, my people deserve protection from the aforementioned vindictive rangers. These people have to get their jollies somewhere, but please don't let it be at our expense.
