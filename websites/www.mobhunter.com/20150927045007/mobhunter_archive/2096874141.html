OF PODS!!!</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-09-20</p>Discussion of the melee balance changes on Test server has gotten completely out of hand. There is an ugly, shameful <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8186.topic">thread</a> on The Safehouse right now, which has no doubt embarrassed many high-level rogues due to the short-sightedness of some posters (both rogue and non-rogue). In fact, don't even read the thing, because it's well past the point of usefulness or of affording reasonable discussion.<p>Absor, in his Fortress of Solitude known as <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Developer|APO|s+Corner&amp;number=1&amp;DaysPrune=20&amp;LastLogin=">Developer's Corner</a>, is able to filter out any amount of noise and post only what he believes to be relevant, so we'll stick with that tranquil stream of discussion for now.<p>In this continuing <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000317.html">thread</a>, Absor made some more clarifications and observations:<p><B>Taunt has come up a lot with players in regard to this. It is not the warrior's job to control all the aggro of the group. It is the group's job to control the aggro of the group. I'm certainly misunderstanding what I'm reading, but I get the impression from the comments that have come in on this issue that warriors want to be able to ensure that the NPC(s) in question never decide to attack anyone but the warrior. Obviously that would make for a silly and boring combat.</B><p>I can't argue with that. In case you haven't figured it out, folks, the high-end game is all about one thing: aggro control. If you can control which person a mob hits--regardless of how much damage the mob does--you can win <B>any</B> fight. While we'd all like warriors to be able to taunt better, if taken to the extreme such a thing would make the game completely boring. Verant isn't looking to do that. Aggro control is the responsibility of <B>every</B> person on a raid, and if you ask me, that's a much more exciting than a guaranteed victory... well, most of the time.<p><B>Rangers and monks will be getting triple attack no sooner and no later than warriors get it.</B><p>That means 60th level, in case you were wondering.<p><B>I've seen it voiced by some rogue players, that rangers and monks are now getting triple attack and they are the only pure melee class without it (warriors already have triple attack).<p>Basically, rogues do not need any increase in damage output. Regardless of other considerations, such as being the only one of the three pure melee classes that doesn't get it (and I can see how that might sound unfair). When the final decision needs to be made, comparing the fact that rogues meet and even slightly exceed our desires for their damage output to the worry that they will be the only pure melee without triple attack, game balance must take precedence over appearance. We're certainly not trying to upset rogue players, but the truth is that rogues just don't need triple attack, and we're not willing to raise the bar for all other melee classes just to give it to them.</B><p>This is one of the big things brought up in that Safehouse thread. Read closely, oh ye who clamor for a rogue triple attack: you already do more damage than intended, so stop asking for more. Verant isn't handing these changes out as toys; they are making them to increase the playability of classes who desperately need an upgrade. Enough with the sour grapes, already.<p>Finally, on the subject of Absor saying balancing casters would be difficult while Kendrick said balancing them would be easy:<p><B>I've seen people taking these two comments out of context and trying to make it seem as though Kendrick and I are at odds with each other in some sort of battle of the pod people.<p>Kendrick is talking about the difference between how hard it is to change code and how hard it is to change content. To make a lot of the melee changes we've got on Test a programmer or three had to be sacrificed to the volcano to get it all done. Most of what I'm guessing would need to be done to make changes to casters would be things that designers do, like spell and database changes and such. I wouldn't be surprised if we had to make a few programmer voodoo dolls, but the coding changes would probably be less extensive.<p>...<p>So, and I'm sorry if this disappoints some folks, Kendrick and I actually get along just fine. We talk to each other, and we find ourselves in agreement over complicated issues more often than we disagree. The office here is not a place of name-calling and teeth gnashing. While there is no shortage of debate, it's not chaos here.<p>Though there is often a hand slapping when it comes to the Friday morning donut feeding frenzy...</B><p>Well, I wasn't implying that Absor and Kendrick were the Krystle and Alexis of the Verant staff or anything. I merely pointed out a seemingly obvious contradiction in statements issued by two separate Verant employees, which I guess technically wasn't a contradiction at all. Fair enough.<p>Maybe someday I'll get to tour the Verant offices and see the good-natured towel-snapping that goes on in the company locker room, or attend some of the group therapy sessions where staffers meet to discuss their feelings. That would be dandy.<p>But if Abashi and Aradune seem like they're getting a bit too touchy-feely, I think I'll have to cut my visit short.
