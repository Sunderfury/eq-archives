				<div class="entry">
					<p><a title="If you don't like what you read at Massively, wait 3 minutes and they'll have a new article up" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/07/30/comic-con-08-38-studios-interview-reveals-ip-announcement-next/" target="_blank">Massively has posted their interview with 38 Studios</a>, featuring Mary Kirchoff (VP of Marketing) and Thom Ang (Art Director).</p>
<p>This article is largely focused on marketing and big-picture plans for the studio. I thought Mary had a couple really good quotes, such as this response to why we&#8217;re doing a fantasy game:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our other perspective on fantasy is that it&#8217;s the most globally accepted medium for conveying epic stories. It&#8217;s accepted over the broadest number of categories in book publishing, which is one of the categories we&#8217;re going to develop our intellectual property inside. We want consumers to enjoy that experience of being in the world 24/7 in different contexts. Fantasy delivers to a global, broad market – just like 38 Studios.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As for when the game name and more detail on the IP will be forthcoming, Mary talked about that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our current plan is to announce the name of the game and launch the IP website (as opposed to the corporate website) about this time next year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the phrase &#8220;our current plan.&#8221; A lot can change in a year, so don&#8217;t get too worked up if those plans change.</p>

					<p>The folks at Ten Ton Hammer also spent some time with the 38 Studios crew at Comic Con, and <a title="Ten tons, and what do you get?" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/39993" target="_blank">wrote up a nice interview</a> in which Scott Cuthbertson (VP of Creative Development) and Thom Ang (Art Director) discussed the art style of Copernicus.</p>
<p>Of course, every gamer knows that what gets created in concept often doesn&#8217;t wind up looking the same way in game. Thom addressed this point well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thom added, “One of the things that we’re doing to ensure this does translate into the actual game environment is that the concept artists who did this are actually the modelers. They’re taking their own paintings and, as artists they’re amazing, but as modelers and world builders they’re also amazing. They’re not having to hand this off to trust someone else to interpret it&#8230; They’re doing their own efficiency tests on it, so they’re involved from the beginning all the way through to end delivery.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For you detail-oriented types, it&#8217;s worth noting that the TTH article included the captions that yours truly wrote for the postcards, but the Zam interview I linked yesterday did not. We&#8217;ll make sure the missing captions get out there.</p>

					<p>At San Diego Comic-Con (<a title="Self reference FTW" href="http://www.moorgard.com/?p=254" target="_self">which I did not attend</a>), the 38 Studios team chatted with a few gaming websites who were covering the event. <a title="I did not draw these.

<p>No, this isn&#8217;t the opening of the information floodgates&#8211;we intend to go back to being quiet for a while. But the convention was a fitting opportunity to show off some of the amazing work of our artists, so we did. Hope you enjoy them.</p>

					<p>Later this week I will be making my first trip to San Diego since leaving SOE. I&#8217;m heading out with a few other people from 38 Studios to attend <a title="Word is they still sell comic books there" href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/" target="_blank">Comic-Con 2008</a>.</p>
<p>No, we won&#8217;t be spilling any beans on Copernicus (our MMO project), so those of you anxious to hear about the game will have to wait. If you get a chance to swing by and say hello, we&#8217;ll be around the McFarlane booth. Photos and autographs with me are only $10 each!</p>
<p>Aside from <a title="Okay, I really want the food more" href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci08_actionfigs.php" target="_blank">cool toy exclusives</a>, the thing I&#8217;m most excited about is being able to buy good Mexican food again. Carne asada overload, here I come!</p>

					<p>We interrupt this vacation/holiday/general malaise update blackout to bring you a link to an <a title="Lots of words at least" href="http://www.mpogd.com/news/?ID=3748" target="_blank">interview</a> that Jason Roberts and I gave to Linda “<a title="Lady with beard = hot" href="http://www.thebrasse.com/" target="_blank">Brasse</a>” Carlson at the ION Conference in Seattle a few weeks back. As you&#8217;ll see, I have honed my community management ability to say lots of words without really giving anything away.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve gotten a favorable response to the interview, despite the fact that it gives few specifics about what we at <a title="Note the revamped website" href="http://www.38studios.com" target="_blank">38 Studios</a> are up to. Actually, if someone went to the trouble of stitching together a few things we&#8217;ve said across various interviews, that person would have enough information to make a pretty good guess about what Copernicus will be. Of course, we&#8217;ve also been vague enough that a number of hypotheses could be made, so I&#8217;m not about to connect the dots for anyone.</p>
<p>Unlike the delight I took in torturing detail-starved fans before EQ2 launched, the reason we&#8217;re being so tight-lipped is not to be smarmy or cagey. We just honestly want to <em>show people what we&#8217;re doing</em> rather than <em>talk about what we plan to do</em>. So as soon as we can do that in a meaningful and concrete way, we will. Until then, you&#8217;ll just have to shake your fist and call us dirty names.</p>
<p>You know, like you do already.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m back in Beantown after taking the red eye from Seattle last night following the conclusion of the <a title="watch for it next year" href="http://www.ionconference.com/" target="_blank">ION Conference</a>. It was a really good show focused on online gaming and MMOs. It was great to meet up with other developers and hear their war stories, as well as talk in person with folks I usually kibitz with through email or blog posts.</p>
<p>One of my favorite bits was a panel looking <a title="Massively had things covered" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/05/15/ion-08-a-five-year-forecast-for-mmos/" target="_blank">five years into the future of MMOs</a>, as discussed by <a title="the Lum speaks" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/05/14/im-old-and-cranky-and-you-should-listen-to-me-about-stuff/" target="_blank">Scott</a> and <a title="A favorite frozen treat" href="http://www.zenofdesign.com/?p=1021" target="_blank">Damion</a> on their blogs. I really want most of what these two guys prophesized to come true, for both personal preference and professional reasons.</p>
<p>Massively also did a <a title="they took more notes than I did" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/05/16/ion-08-taking-an-mmo-community-from-pre-launch-to-live/" target="_blank">lengthy recap of the panel I put together</a>. It was well received by the audience, and I was very pleased with the insightful discussion fostered by my four panelists. I was lucky to get four skilled community managers with a ton of experience and a lot of compelling opinions. My thanks to Craig, Victor, Katie, and Meghan for participating.</p>
<p>The article mentions that I started things off with a rant, which I wrote the night before after attending the MMO 2013 panel and hearing those folks riffing about how little respect community managers get in this industry. So I decided to unleash my inner Moorgard and stir things up a bit to kick off my panel.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t do any slides (h8 u, pwrpoynt) but I am posting the text of my rant for those of you interested. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=225#more-225" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>Just a reminder that next week I&#8217;ll be moderating a panel at the ION Game Conference in Seattle called &#8220;<a title="I'm so damn wordy" href="http://www.ionconference.com/session.php?id=10894" target="_blank">Taking Your Community from Pre-Launch to Live</a>.&#8221; The session is on Thursday, May 15, at 2pm, so swing by and say hello if you happen to be there. I&#8217;ll also be on Jason Roberts&#8217; panel called &#8220;<a title="Dymus is even wordier" href="http://www.ionconference.com/session.php?id=10816" target="_blank">Changing a Live Game: Lessons Learned and Techniques Applied</a>&#8221; in which I will explain how to make people love you while you nerf their classes. That panel is Wednesday, May 14, at 9am (way too early, I know).</p>
<p>Moderating a panel is ideal, because I get to disguise my ineptitude by asking questions of smart people. And if it goes well, I still take all the credit! Muahahahaahaa!!11!! Guess I&#8217;ll just have to fake competence on Dymus&#8217; panel.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will find a way to talk a bit about the importance of community at 38 Studios and all that stuff.</p>

					<p>I had an absolute blast at New York Comic Con. It wasn&#8217;t has hectic as the San Diego version, which made it quite a bit easier to get around while still having a ton of cool stuff to see. There were some great costumes, as well as some really unfortunate ones&#8211;some of which I still see in my nightmares. Hopefully the therapy kicks in soon and I can sleep through the night again.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t been to a fan convention in quite a while, and I&#8217;d forgotten how much I enjoy them. Industry shows are full of people trying to convince you how smart they are or how they have all the answers; fans conventions are full of people who want to have a good time. The thing that energizes me is that these are people who <em>want to believe </em>in something bigger than themselves. They dream of larger-than-life heroes and villains who live in fantastic worlds somehow grander or more perilous than our own. I get such a charge out of being at shows like this, whether the main focus is comics or video games.</p>
<p>As for what I was actually there for, you can watch the <a href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/31233" title="Hint: I'm the obnoxious one." target="_blank">video recap of our panel on 38 Studios&#8217; first year</a>, or read an <a href="http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1905" title="Would have loved a spell check, guys." target="_blank">interview I did with MMORPG.com</a>. Sorry, no sneak peaks at the game just yet, but we did showcase our love of pastries. And really, isn&#8217;t that just as good?</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for the steak, Paul!</p>

<p>Okay, I realize this isn&#8217;t a sports blog or anything, but I&#8217;m pretty sure most people reading this don&#8217;t have a boss who just kicked ass in the World Series, so I wanted to crow a little.</p>
<p>It seems like anytime the announcers  said Curt&#8217;s name, they were prompted to follow immediately with a phrase like &#8220;who isn&#8217;t the pitcher he used to be.&#8221; Well, say what you will about the young Rockies stud, but which pitcher would you have wanted on the mound for you last night? That&#8217;s right, the one who got the win, bitches.</p>
<p>The above picture of Curt coming off the field in the 6th, featured in the <a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/baseball/red_sox/view.bg?articleid=1040563" title="Good article" target="_blank">Boston Herald</a>, is telling. Despite his protestations in press conferences that he&#8217;s not thinking about whether he&#8217;ll be back at Fenway next year, the emotion and appreciation on his face says it all.</p>
