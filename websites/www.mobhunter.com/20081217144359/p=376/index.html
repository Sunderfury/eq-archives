			<div class="entry">
				<p>Like so many others, I have been lured by the call of the Lich King. After drifting off into AoC and WAR for a while, one appreciates just how polished and solid the act of playing WoW is. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s perfect; rather, I mean the fact that there usually aren&#8217;t stupid little annoyances that gnaw away at your urge to play like so many rabid chipmunks.</p>
<p>My main in WoW has been an undead warrior, a character of which I&#8217;ve never been especially fond. As a DPS build, I pretended he was a monk in order to get through the day. As an undead, I pretended he used to be an attractive human (unlike the human models in WoW, which I can&#8217;t stand). You might guess based upon my general malaise that I was a prime candidate to try out the death knight, and you&#8217;d be right.</p>
<p>General impressions and a couple spoilers after the break.<span id="more-376"></span></p>
<p>First off, the death knight intro quests are cooler than anything that I&#8217;ve seen in WoW (or most any MMOG) so far. Built upon their phasing technology, you move back and forth through the zone and see real changes based on the quests you&#8217;ve done. That&#8217;s extremely awesome!</p>
<p>Secondly, the armor that you get looks absolutely badass. I made a blood elf male DK and am completely sold on how he looks. Extra awesome!</p>
<p>Thirdly, the death knight cuts through mobs like a hot knife through butter. There&#8217;s something scandalously appealing about a class that makes you feel like you&#8217;re exploiting the system just by playing it. You can just about mash random buttons and be extremely successful. Super duper awesome!</p>
<p>However, there are negatives that go along with each of these positives. Here&#8217;s where the spoilers come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>After playing through all these cool, dynamic, zone-changing quests, you get dumped into the static, never-changing Outland. Ugh! Give me one freaking 60-70 zone in Wrath so I don&#8217;t have to relive this grind!</li>
<li>The quest line builds up the notion that you really don&#8217;t want to be working for mean old Arthas. You can almost taste your betrayal moment coming&#8230; except it doesn&#8217;t. Instead, your boss decides that he will no longer work for the Lich King, so now you won&#8217;t be working for him either. How rebellious of you&#8211;not!</li>
<li>That awesome DK armor? Yeah, prepare to trade it in for a clown suit as you level through Outland. Personally, I&#8217;m determined to wear my quest gear until I absolutely can&#8217;t anymore, but even so it&#8217;s a bummer to lose out on that badass look. Blizzard, give us vanity slots already!</li>
</ul>
<p>The only saving grace with playing through Outland again is that the overpowered death knight completes quests so much faster than characters did the first time around (especially compared to my cumbersome warrior). Besides just killing quickly, you also get a fast horse with access to a talent that increases your speed to godlike levels. It should take far less time to get to a reasonable level in the BC zones, at which point you can jump over to Wrath and get to the new stuff.</p>
<p>Will the death knight be my new main character? In all likelihood, yes. I already feel more of a personal connection to it than I did to my undead warrior, and the class is just plain fun to play. You can&#8217;t throw a rock in Outland without hitting a dozen death knights, and I&#8217;m sure there will be even more people trying them out once they get their main characters to 80.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a raider or a soloer or anywhere in between, I recommend playing through the death knight starting experience at least once. It features some of the best quests in WoW so far and leaves you with a very intriguing new character to play around with. As for yours truly, you will find me in Outland for a while, but eventually Moordeth will be making his way to the frozen north.</p>
<p>After all, I owe Arthas a visit.</p>

			<p>Outlands has been nerfed multiple times since most people ran their first 60 through it, as has the amount of xp needed to level from 60-70. In addition, Death Knights start with a set of Blue quest gear that is probably comparable to Molten Core or better. All of these probably contribute to the illussion of them feeling overpowered. They really do even out once you get to Northrend.</p>

			<p>The Shadowknight class was my favorite class in the original Everquest. It was my main; a dark elf Shadowknight. I loved everything about that class, from the look to the starting zone to the quests (armor and epic). </p>
<p>The lack of an anti-Paladin/Shadowknight was the primary reason I opted for Everquest 2 instead of WoW when those games were released so close to each other.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, after I getting into EQ2, it was the Paladin that captured me, and not the Shadowknight. But by then I&#8217;d made my gaming choice, and I felt it was too late to switch to WoW (plus I heard terrible things about the WoW Paladin being a total wussy). </p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad to hear WoW brought in a dark knight class. It sounds fun as heck. I know if I had a broadband connection I&#8217;d certainly pick up the game tomorrow and give it a go. Oh well&#8230;</p>

			<p>The idea of time phasing was introduced if I&#8217;m not mistaken by Turbine in Lord of the Rings Online. Each player would start off in their own instance which explained the introductory story, then they would be funneled into a phased &#8220;newbie&#8221; area where they would have to stay until they completed the final quest. Then they&#8217;d be dumped into the world at large. I think this technique has some very good potential if used on a wider scale.</p>
<p>As far as the Death Knight, I feel the class is fundamentally flawed which I have discussed endlessly on my blog. It&#8217;s obvious that Blizzard spent a lot of time and resources on making the DK starting area amazing in order to sell their very first hero class. The problem is that you as a player are forced into committing evil and repugnant acts if you want to progress your character. Too bad that Blizzard didn&#8217;t give players the ability to make moral choices like in Fable &#8212; that would have been revolutionary. With the DK, one gets the feeling that they are on an elaborate amusement park ride with very little if any input from the player.</p>
<p>Of course most players will enjoy playing a DK &#8212; who wouldn&#8217;t want to play Superman? Who also wouldn&#8217;t want to get 55 levels free from Blizzard and start off with a high level character complete with epic mount, free port ability, blue gear, and bad ass graphic and sound effects?</p>
<p>To be honest, the DK feels more like a &#8220;welfare&#8221; class then it does a hero class. There is nothing heroic required of the player in order to play a Deathknight. It&#8217;s very disappointing. Power should always be earned and not bestowed. Clearly the devs at Blizzard have forgotten this core design principle.  In the end the DK is pure gimmickry, used to help market and sell an expansion from a company that has become addicted to their own &#8220;millions served&#8221; press releases.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m planning to keep all my blue starting gear as an Outfitter set called &#8220;vanity&#8221; and wear it every time I&#8217;m walking around town. Sword and all.

			<p>Heh the biggest draw to me as well was because I was absolutly in love with my shadow knight in eq1&#8230; for 5 years I barly played another character.  So I chose to try the DK and Dear god it is awsome&#8230;   I am 71 on my way to 72 now and it is just so much fun&#8230; I am going with a frost tank build ( my server and imm sure many servers ) have tank and healer shortages&#8230; so the only problem ive had getting groups thus far is &#8230;. peoples ignorance to the DK.</p>
<p>Here is a hint for avoiding alot of the dk&#8217;s on your server thought with it being out a few days now it might be a little harder. skip zones after The BS with hellfire I compleatly skipped zangermarsh  and went right to the forrest&#8230; and it was nearly empty YAY I then skipped negrand as well and went right to blades &#8230; I saw 3 people the entire time I was there&#8230; I then went to shadowmoon vally got to 68 and went to northrend. ( at 68 I reccomend doing the starting quests of both 68 - 71  areas very quick and easy quests went from 68 - 69 in 2 hours and 7 min including the travel time ) </p>
<p>the &#8220;clown&#8221; suits in northrend at least for plate does not look bad&#8230; a little on the plain side&#8230; but id MUCH rather loook plain then fugly.</p>

<p>But they remembered an even more important principle: Bring the fun!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy the moral choices thing. This is a <i>death knight.</i> The character isn&#8217;t about moral choices (nor is the WoW storyline, for that matter). It wouldn&#8217;t fit the class. I would, however, have liked for the rebellion against Arthas to have a personal side to it rather than having it just be my character following orders.</p>
<p>Overall, I say poop on you! DKs 4 lyfe, yo!</p>

			<p>I have to agree with your spoiler-filled discussion. I played through the DK quest line myself, as did my wife, and we both loved it. i had a hard time getting my head around the changing zones until you described it as a new technology. Were they instances? Did the zone really change? It was hard to figure out.</p>
<p>Like you, I stopped just as my blood elf DK (we even picked the same race) got to Outland. I expect it&#8217;s hard to put an entire set of content in to level the next ten levels but from what I understand, 40 hours and a quest guide will get you to Northrend pretty quick.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;m really impressed with WotLK. It&#8217;s everything a good MMO should be - except it should be on a console.</p>

<p>This is exactly the attitude a gaming company should take if they want to watch their subscribers drop 95%. This is the sort of thing EQ did for years and now all thats left are a bunch of guilds struggling to find meaning in three years of obsolete content they can&#8217;t defeat.</p>

			<p>Good point about fun. Fun is at the top of the game designers pyramid. Challenge, lore, class design and other gameplay elements should ultimately be subservient to fun. The question is though: what is fun? Is fun getting something for free or is fun working for something? Ah, there&#8217;s the rub.</p>
<p>I agree that Blizzard put a lot of *fun* into the Deathknight. No one can deny that the DK is a triumph of design, effects and even the DK quest/storyline which is masterfully executed &#8212; clearly they pulled out all the stops. Personally I was hoping for more of a transformative personal epic quest where a player would sacrifice their high level character and turn into a Death Knight. I doubt that would have been a problem for most players that have a stable full of maxed out characters. At least that would have been unique and involved some element of cost from the player. </p>
<p>To me the DK, looks like a freebie, loss leader devised to entice players to purchase the expansion: &#8220;Thank you for purchasing Wrath of the Lich King, here is your level 55 Death Knight&#8230;&#8221;. No doubt Blizzard will again break all records. What concerns me is the about the long term impact of hero classes (more coming I&#8217;m sure) on the existing class framework and the overall health of the game.</p>

			<p>I just took advantage of the free 10-day &#8220;welcome back&#8221;.  I rolled up a Night Elf Druid and am having a lot of fun.  My biggest problem with WoW is the art.  But I&#8217;m past that.  I agree&#8230;it&#8217;s easy to play WoW.  AoC was a grind.  WAR is too complex at a time for me when life is too complex.  WoW is just easy to load, logon, read quest and play.  I&#8217;m not sure I will play past the 10-day free &#8220;welcome back&#8221;, especially since GTAIV for the PC is out now.  But who knows?</p>

			<blockquote cite="Wolfshead"><p>The question is though: what is fun?</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s all relative. We used to have these discussions on various message boards and I&#8217;ve always believed you could boil MMO gamers down into two main camps. </p>
<p>The first camp is the group of people want to be entertained. To them, an MMO is no different than a game of chess, a hand of poker, or a match against a buddy in Madden when it comes to entertainment value. It&#8217;s a GAME to them, in the purest sense of the word. Unvarnished entertainment. Fun. And for those people, fun is THE keyword. It&#8217;s not anything else. So the whole risk/reward aspect, or the raid tactics, or whatever, none of those things have nearly as much impact on them as the raw entertainment value of the thing. And the minute their fun gets diminished because of obstacles, they&#8217;re gone.  </p>
<p>The second group of people are more carrot-oriented. It&#8217;s not so much about being entertained as it is working toward a goal. They&#8217;re goal-oriented people. They enjoy overcoming challenges, obstacles; they like feeling like they&#8217;re earning something. They don&#8217;t like tedious tasks and repetitive quests, but they&#8217;ll do it if it means something bigger and grander at the end. These are the people who put together the dragon-slaying guilds and push the limits of the content. </p>
<p>Now, you could put a game of checkers down in front of the two camps and ask them to play each other, and they could potentially have &#8216;fun&#8217;, but for vastly different reasons. A camp 1 player is going to have fun if he just enjoys the act of playing checkers; if the checkers look neat and he feels like he&#8217;s &#8220;winning&#8221; most of the time. A camp 2 player could have fun too - if he&#8217;s achieving his objectives. If there are no objectives, he&#8217;ll make up his own. Like, &#8220;I need to the next six games in a row, or I start over&#8221;. That&#8217;s just the way they operate. </p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve come to believe there are a lot more camp 1 folks than camp 2. And I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s good or bad; it&#8217;s just how it is. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m a camp 2 guy myself. I like challenge, I like risk/reward, I enjoy goal-setting and achievement. I&#8217;m wired that way. But I totally get that there is a another camp of gamers, and they&#8217;re numbers are bigger than mine. And I don&#8217;t have a problem with that. </p>
<p>The smart developers are going to build content for everyone anyway. And that&#8217;s what Blizzard has done.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m loving WotLK so far. I have leveled my ret pally up to 80 already and have been through all the regular dungeons at least once. (Got the achievement too!) </p>
<p>I absolutely love their use of the phasing technology!!!!!!!!!!!!! The most memorable quest for me wasn&#8217;t really a huge dynamic quest or anything really important, but the results and use of the phasing stunned me. In Icecrown through a series of quests you eventually get to one where you are supposed to protect some builders while they build a tower. That&#8217;s right, build a tower. Now, all you really see while you are fighting off mobs is three dwarves swinging hammers in a static location, however, once you have successfully defended them the phasing kicks in. The quest finisher appears, you turn in the quest and all of a sudden a tower appears along with vendors, more quest givers and a flight path. </p>
<p>I was stunned. Sure, I&#8217;ve been through the DK starting quests and I completed the Wrathgate questline which turns the valley into a flame filled wasteland, but I had not even considered them using it to &#8220;add&#8221; new quest hubs and flight paths that weren&#8217;t even there before. </p>
<p>Now I am obsessed with going back and completing all the rest of the quests just to see if there was anything I missed by not doing them.</p>
