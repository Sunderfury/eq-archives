Necromancers have the same issues that make this spell worth while. Why not give this to the necromancer as well. I get tired of recasting pets and medding again.<p>Allot of time wasted.<p>Nastar</B><p>quote:<p>We've heard many compelling arguments for giving this to other pet classes. I have updated Summon Companion on Test Server to be usable by Necromancers, Enchanters, Shaman, and Shadow Knights in addition to Magicians. <p>Necromancers, Enchanters, and Shaman will get the spell at level 44 and Shadow Knights will get it at level 52. <p>- Lawrence Poe<p>While we initially wanted to keep this spell unique to Magicians, one of the practical uses of the spell is to help pet casters get passed any pathing problems they might encounter. We understand that giving this to other classes might bother some folks that play Magicians, this seems to be the best course. The spell, while unique, isn't as much of a balance spell as a convenience spell.<p>Alan</I><p>As the compelling reasons to play a magician have now dwindled down to precisely one (okay, two--if you have the epic), local mages were seen applying for re-education benefits at the nearby Employment Agency. Best of luck, folks. Please decide which race of warrior you'd like to play and move along.
