			<div class="entry">
				<p>It&#8217;s not like I was looking forward to the Olympics. As a kid who never had much interest in televised sports, the Olympics made me a little bitter because they meant that my usual TV shows weren&#8217;t on. While I don&#8217;t bear that grudge anymore, I have never really developed a fondness for the games.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ll be damned if the Olympics aren&#8217;t impossible to turn off. Part of it must be the drama, part the incredible record-shattering physical feats. Whatever it is, you gotta give NBC credit for some really well-paced coverage.</p>
<p>People blame MMOs for causing addiction, but what about the Olympics? I&#8217;m not getting anything done because I&#8217;m too busy wondering if Phelps is going to sweep. There ought to be laws regulating this stuff!</p>

			<p>Its all about the camera, the human body, and drama from sports (war).  There is a reason Michelangelo did sculptures of the human body.  There is a reason most Olympic sports were and in some cases still part of warfare.  This stuff goes back to early man and continues today for a reason.  If it sucked it would not have lasted the centuries.  Technology has finally got a camera where it needed to be, that of one participating in the event and not standing in the stands or listening on the radio.</p>
<p>There many things messed up about the Olympics and one does not have to look much beyond the athlete bodies to see it but that is another discussion for another day.</p>

			<p>I one up that Crack and raise you a soul sucking fiend.  Can you believe watching the Olympics made me grab the Beijing 2008 game? Yes, this game is actually good. <img src='http://www.mobhunter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>But, yeah, the Olympics.  It&#8217;s mind blowing to watch all of these records being smashed.  The gymnastics and swimming pretty much consumes my time.</p>
<p>And yes, Phelps will sweep. The last 2 are a cake walk. But it&#8217;s still awesome to see the kid work his glorified magic.</p>

			<p>Nothing special about the records when swimming in the fastest pools every made.  Add in the new suits and if the records did not fall someone better remeasure that pool.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new pools, which are deeper and now feature 10 lanes so the two outside lanes can remain empty, have also played a role because turbulence has been reduced. It&#8217;s easier to swim fast in smooth water, and waves dissipate quickly into high-tech gutters. The pool in Beijing is also three meters deep, whereas most pools in previous Olympics were only two meters deep. That means a swimmer such as Phelps, who gets a turbo boost off the wall on his turns, can dive deeper and stay under water longer. According to his coach Bob Bowman, that helps him do his dolphin kick for a longer period of time, and helps him go faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More sophisticated pool design has also helped to dissipate wave action that can slow a swimmer. The Olympic pool in Beijing is three meters deep, compared to two meters, or 6 feet, for many racing pools. The added depth is designed to lessen water resistance for swimmers by insulating them from turbulence that rebounds off the bottom of a shallower pool.</p>
<p>For major international competitions, like the Olympics, the pool is 10 lanes wide, instead of eight. The two empty outside lanes serve as buffers, keeping the waves from ricocheting, dispersing them instead to a gutter system that is flush with the surface of the water.</p>
<p>The plastic buoys that serve as lane dividers, or lane lines, are designed to direct water downward instead of outward. The nonskid starting blocks are meant to facilitate a propulsive takeoff, somewhat similar to track and field, which can shave valuable ticks off the clock.&#8221;"</p>

			<p>I can&#8217;t seem to turn it off either.  Even if the pool is fast, many of the records are being wiped out by several seconds - amazing.  But it isn&#8217;t just the swimming.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed practically everything NBC has shown us.  I also think that China is getting a great PR deal in the midst of all of this - watch for the commercials featuring local people and locations, they are very enticing.  I guess it&#8217;s time for the world to get a new look at one of our largest and oldest civilizations.</p>

			<p>The funniest part about the Olympics is how everyone suddenly pretends to care about obscure sports that they only think about&#8230; you guessed it, every four years when the Olympics are on&#8230; *chuckle*</p>

			<p>That&#8217;s true about obscure sports, but really, other than during the Olympics how often do they actually broadcast Women&#8217;s Team Sabre Fencing?  Women&#8217;s Beach Volleyball&#8230; sure - for obvious reasons.  But we don&#8217;t think about so many of the sports most of the time because they are never broadcast or even reported on - except during the Olympics.  Kind of sad really.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m not watching the Olympics on NBC, other than to catch highlights in HD. The commentators won&#8217;t shut up&#8230;or they talk about only the US atheletes no matter how many other countries are in an event. They keep saying the coverage is &#8220;live&#8221; when it&#8217;s clearly hours old&#8230;then they say, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s because we can&#8217;t tell who will be watching it when.&#8221; BS, that <img src='http://www.mobhunter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Instead, I catch the events &#8220;live&#8221; on CBC (the Canadian station). It&#8217;s not HD, which is the only drawback. Their commentators talk about all the athletes in an event and they don&#8217;t seem to hold back events just to pump in more commercials.  For example, the women&#8217;s all-around last night was over at a reasonable hour on CBC, but went till 1AM on NBC. Sheesh!</p>

<p>Much of what is making sport big was in games first.  It is time to games to copy sports for everyone outside of single player mode.</p>
