		<description><![CDATA[Well, believe it or not...at this VERY second I am playing on a classic eq emu.  And, I happen to be tabbed out and surfing the net as I wait for hasten to spawn in rathe mountains (or more precisely, for Brother Z to despawn or be killed).  I won&#039;t say I&#039;m having a great time...and yet, I am.  I truly truly am.  I can&#039;t wait to link the jboots in guild chat and get flooded with &quot;grats&quot;  from friends.  I can&#039;t wait to get questions from folks who get stuck on a part of the quest and share with them the tricks I know that might save some time....EQ is a strange strange beast, and it still captivates me.  

It isn&#039;t just the lore...although, I have always been a lore junkie.  Lore still captivates me.  The story of Hsagra in Velious is one of the most beautiful stories I&#039;ve ever read about in any MMO.  You don&#039;t need to know it---there isn&#039;t a single &quot;quest&quot; that requires you to really know the lore.  It&#039;s easier today than it was 15 years ago, but I have a walkthru open in another window at almost all times.  I can mindlessly move from step to step, hand in to hand in, camp to camp until I finish...never once being required to really read or know anything about anything.  I can also tell you that the first time I realized that Tormax was sitting on a giant-sized throne made from the skull of Hsagra---Yelinak&#039;s mate---I was filled with real hatred to avenge my dragon friends.  Killing Tormax wasn&#039;t just about getting my flowing thought 2 booties.  But it isn&#039;t about the lore.  As you rightly pointed out, the quest system in original EQ was a mess.  There were literally hundreds of unsolved quests and quests that couldn&#039;t be finished because they were broken.  I still have Inquisitor Seru&#039;s Sword of Truth in my bag on live, hoping to someday find out what quest it is for...

Quests in EQ force players to work together on many levels.  Certainly, tactically as cooperative game play goes in any multi-player game.  But also, to truly support each other...sometimes even emotionally because the quests were just dumbly difficult or unfair.  I main a bard on the classic emo that has been waiting to get his epic for almost a year now, but Trakanon (classic, no undead bard yet) is constantly raced to by other guilds that steal him right from under me.  My guildmates know what I am thinking as they race past us to engage first or kill steal the mob away from us.  My pulse races.  My anxiety rises...I have a real physical reaction to what is going on in the game.  And, it happens very frequently in EQ.  Even the most anti-lore player can not escape this drama in classic EQ.  Drama, for all its ills, also makes worlds real.

I&#039;ll also toss this in:  I have no idea if you had any input on writing this, Moorgard.  The House of Ballads quest line from Kingdoms of Amalur is one of the best stories in any role playing game (online, solo, or real pen and paper) that I&#039;ve ever played.  This quest &quot;hooked&quot; me for sure on Amalur.  So, some players definitely thirst for this stuff.  Then again, I&#039;m always a sucker for a good story.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You nailed it, and that&#039;s why you&#039;re the Loregard and I&#039;m just a romantic. ;) While EQ&#039;s quests wouldn&#039;t fly today, the spirit of what they accomplished absolutely can and should be apart of modern MMO design. Dangit Steve, make it happen! :P]]></description>
