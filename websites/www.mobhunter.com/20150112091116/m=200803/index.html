				<div class="entry">
					<p>Design lessons that spring forth from practical experience are much more memorable than those read in books or preached at you on long-winded blogs. Case in point: Cameron Sorden made an <a href="http://random-battle.com/2008/03/25/the-combat-conundrum/" title="Also, killing is gooooood." target="_blank">excellent post</a> illustrating how trying to get away from an established paradigm can often reveal what was appealing about that paradigm in the first place.</p>
<p>For me, this touches on one of the differences between virtual worlds and games (yeah, I still think there&#8217;s a difference&#8211;in design intent if nothing else&#8211;and P. Neva agrees with me, so I must be right). In a world simulation, there would be far-reaching consequences for whether you negotiate or attack, just like there would be in real life. In a game, I want to do whatever is the most fun&#8211;and much of the time, that involves being a badass and killing stuff.</p>
<p>Being a badass is cool. When the Space Invaders made their first move on my bases, I didn&#8217;t want to negotiate a truce; I wanted to blow the hell out of them! MMO combat may get repetitive, but many players still find some measure of satisfaction in it (even while complaining about its dullness).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big believer that, regardless of the theme of your MMO, you want to make it clear that your players are badasses. Now, that doesn&#8217;t just mean one has to be a great fighter; if you&#8217;re smart, you&#8217;ll also provide the means to be a badass crafter, a badass diplomat (cf. Vanguard&#8217;s diplomacy card game), a badass house decorator, a badass cantina dancer, or whatever. Players are not victims at the mercy of the world; they are heroes who actively shape their world&#8217;s destiny.</p>
<p>The challenge for the storyteller in an MMO is to give up enough of that destiny to the players for it to be meaningful while still maintaining control over the big threads. MMOs haven&#8217;t been very good at doing that. Yet.

					<p><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17902" title="Go ahead, count the grammar errors." target="_blank">This article</a> irritated me. <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17963" title="No errors?? Mus' be one of them wryter tipes." target="_blank">This article</a> made me feel better.</p>
<p>I mean, I get what Maxwell is trying to say, even with all the grammar errors. It is true that gameplay should trump story in our medium, because many people will play a great game with a mediocre story while few will tolerate the reverse. But claiming that writers aren&#8217;t worth the trouble is stupid. Like any specialist, they just need to be utilized effectively.</p>
<p>I could write a similar sensationalized piece (with fewer grammar errors, cuz that&#8217;s how I roll) arguing that sound engineers are useless because you can make a super fun game using only stock sound effects, and therefore time spent on fancy audio is wasted. But I&#8217;d be ignorant for doing so, because anyone with a modicum of insight realizes that spending the time creating professional audio for your game is going to make it so much richer and more memorable.</p>
<p>As ever, a lot of this stuff is a matter of degree and is at least somewhat dependent upon the type of game one is trying to create. But to make a broad generalization that writers aren&#8217;t useful in game development is, frankly, an ignorant thing to do. I think the rebuttal piece illustrates the many flaws in the original argument and hopefully helps relegate it to the dustbin.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Often as I eat my lunch I will jump into a battleground in WoW or run a quest or two. Since the servers are usually down on Tuesdays during my lunch hour here on the east coast, I decided it was an excellent opportunity to enjoy a bit of nostalgia and log into EverQuest. After all, it is the ninth anniversary of the MMO I have loved the most, so I&#8217;ve been kind of itching to jump in and take a look around.</p>
<p>I dusted off Sensei Moorgard Ghostfist and proceeded to find my way from Crescent Reach (how the hell did I end up there?) to take my first tour of the redone Highpass Hold, a place I spent a hell of a lot of time back in the day. The sensei entered Highkeep, where he did his duty and cleared out some nasty goblins from the basement. Seeing as how he spent nearly all of levels 19 to 30 in that place, he feels a certain obligation to its inhabitents&#8211;especially since there was no one else in the zone to battle the nasties.</p>
<p>My only real difficulty, aside from the horrible map window, was relearning EQ&#8217;s archaic control scheme. I swear to you, it&#8217;s maddening. Usually the controls make me insane after a few minutes and I log out in a huff, wondering how a modern gamer puts up with them. But by this time I had an audience of coworkers looking on, including our Creator of Worlds, R.A. Salvatore. We chatted about old times, and I amassed a mighty train through Kithicor Forest as I went to have a look around the Commonlands. I stopped to pay my respects to Kizdean Gix, pulverizing him in short order (burn in hell, you bastard!). Then I spotted a hill giant near the toll gate and decided to administer a critical beatdown upon his oversized noggin.</p>
<p>I happened to notice that a couple aggro orcs were chasing me. No big deal; I would handle them after the giant met his maker.</p>
<p>Instead, I glanced up at my health bar to find it receding rapidly. What the hell, orcs in the Commonlands were kicking my butt? I am Sensei Moorgard Ghostfist, holder of the Celestial Fists, defiler of planes, and future Avatar of Tranquility! This is madness!</p>
<p>All of a sudden I was experiencing my first naked corpse run in untold years. And, like all retired monks, I was bound in Plane of Tranquility. Unf.</p>
<p>Okay, take the book to PoK, then use the Freeport stone, and run to my corpse from the other direction. I could handle that. When I realized that the map didn&#8217;t show my corpse, I was again aghast at how spoiled I&#8217;ve become. I ran to the general area of the toll booth and started looking.</p>
<p>Orcs. More of them. Welcome to corpse run number two.</p>
<p>The first corpse run was nostalgic&#8211;funny, even&#8211;but by this point I was just pissed. Why the hell were there blue orcs in the Commonlands who could kill my level 65 monk? So I did a search and <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=128802" title="Google is your friend" target="_blank">found out</a>. Leave it to me to get nostalgic in the midst of some kind of zone event.</p>
<p>This time I was successful, snagging my equipment (how can it take so long to re-equip my gear?) and the naked corpse. Suitably humbled, the noble sensei logged off atop the Commonlands wizard tower.</p>
<p>The moral of the story? You <em>can </em>go home again. But if you do, a gang of overpowered orcs is likely to hand you your ass.</p>
<p>Happy birthday, EverQuest!

<p>Read as far as you can into the comments. I mean, it&#8217;s like watching Springer, but without the cleverness.</p>
<p>There are days I wish I was slightly higher on the schizophrenic scale, because I feel I could be a much more prolific blogger if I was simply bat-shit crazy. Alas, an overly rational mind is my downfall.</p>
<p>Prokofy Neva is the perfect example of what happens when you try to use the Internet to prove you&#8217;re smarter than other people. You. Never. Stop. Posting.</p>
<p>As a result, I present Ms. Neva with the first annual Moorgard.com &#8220;Keeping it real&#8221; award. Well done!<BR></p>

					<p>Tobold recently posted an <a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2008/03/interview-with-gold-seller.html" title="The evil that men do lives after them" target="_blank">insightful (and inciteful) interview</a> with a representative from a US-based RMT service. The subject, Chris Bottomley (you can&#8217;t make this stuff up), speaks eloquently about how much safer it is to deal with an upstanding American firm than its Chinese rivals, and guesstimates at how much Blizzard makes each year from banned accounts purchasing new CD keys and game cards.</p>
<p>Though Tobold is taken some heat from his readers, some of whom seem to feel that reporters who <em>talk to people</em> about stuff are thereby <em>endorsing </em>said stuff (hint: they&#8217;re not), I think it&#8217;s a really good read that presents a side of the whole RMT debate we don&#8217;t hear a lot about.</p>
<p>When the whole gold selling thing came into the attention sphere of MMO gamers, the debate centered on whether it was fair for some players to pay real money as a substitute for in-game achievement. More recently, the focus is on the disruption caused within the game world by gold farmers who spam in public channels, monopolize content, and devalue the gameplay of average people.</p>
<p>So the question is, if the whole disruption angle went away, is the knowledge that someone bought gold for their character really still a problem? The gamer purist in me says yes; the pragmatist says it&#8217;s a minor evil I could live with, considering the alternatives. While there are still some people who shout &#8220;Just make the process of earning gold fun instead of a grind,&#8221; the fact is that <em>any </em>kind of path to achievement is going to be seen as a grind by the person who wants to get to the end result immediately. As long as gold can be traded and used to buy stuff, there will be a demand for gold.</p>
<p>All that said, I can&#8217;t help but find it distasteful for a gold seller to don a white hat and proclaim &#8220;I&#8217;m the good guy! They&#8217;re the ones who mess up your game. You know, those godless Chinese people.&#8221; Blame the other guy all you want&#8211;hell, blame the buyer for wanting the gold in the first place&#8211;but no matter how you slice it, even the God-fearing American gold seller is still helping to enable a behavior that&#8217;s fundamentally counter to the spirit of the game.</p>
<p>We still care about that, don&#8217;t we?

He was a great dog, a friendly and playful sort who remembered me when I&#8217;d come for visits and always wanted me to chase him around the living room. Buddy was a great companion for my brother and was with him through some rough times. He will be greatly missed.</p>
<p>As a kid in Lutheran school growing up, I was taught that animals don&#8217;t have souls and therefore can&#8217;t go to Heaven. I disagree completely. I think that animals are so giving of affection and so bereft of vice and selfishness that their spirits can&#8217;t just disappear into nothingness. I believe that everything good about them goes back into the world in some way, making us all the better for their presence having been among us.</p>
<p>How we treat our pets says a lot about our worth as people. Buddy lived a great life with my brother and nephew, and knew every day that he was loved. Who among us could wish for any more than that?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to you, Buddy. Hope you enjoy pooping in that giant backyard in the sky.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;m late to the party, but there&#8217;s been a <a href="http://www.zenofdesign.com/?p=1018" title="Everything Zen" target="_blank">conversation</a> on <a href="http://random-battle.com/2008/02/22/the-craziness-of-the-aggro-radius/" title="AI is a Battle" target="_blank">MMO mob AI</a> that&#8217;s been going on <a href="http://www.zenofdesign.com/?p=337" title="The way back machine" target="_blank">for a while now</a>. The debate is how to get more &#8220;realistic&#8221; AI into these games, such that NPCs in the world seem to behave more intelligently.</p>
<p>Damion sums it up thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The primary concern of AI in MMOs is to be deterministic, interesting and fun.  Realism is cool if it happens on the way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with his overall assessment that players don&#8217;t actually want <em>realistic </em>AI (oh, how I hate that word being used in relation to fantasy MMOs). They want <em>better </em>AI with just enough variety to make them feel smart for having figured out how to beat the bad guys, because nothing in gaming feels quite as satisfying as besting a challenging opponent. This, by the way, is why PvP and raiding are popular; success gives you the feeling that you&#8217;ve outsmarted another person or solved a puzzle that required complex execution.</p>
<p>There is absolutely a danger that AI can go too far. If you have too much variety in NPC behavior, you reach a point where the majority of your players aren&#8217;t going to be able to predict it reliably. This prevents them from feeling smart and successful, and thus they will not have fun. EverQuest could get away with beating people over the head this way at the turn of the century, but modern games can&#8217;t&#8211;not even WoW.</p>
<p>The trick, then, is striking the balance between offering enough variety in AI to make players feel that they&#8217;re beating smart mobs without overwhelming them and making them feel helpless. Sure, make it feel like they&#8217;re fighting against real people, but make sure it&#8217;s r<em>eal people that are slightly less smart than they are</em>.</p>
<p>Nobody likes randomness in MMOs; they like randomness within highly controlled and predictable ranges. That&#8217;s not just true of AI, but of many systems.
