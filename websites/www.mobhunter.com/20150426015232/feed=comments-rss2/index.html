		<description><![CDATA[Your framing of the Kickstarter relationship as an investor relationship is exactly my objection to this.  As you said, it potentially lets the creators get the necessary funds to build their product (and incidentally minimize if not eliminate their risk) but it really doesn&#039;t treat the person who gives of their money as an investor.

Sure, they may get some token item and a &quot;free&quot; copy of the product but at the end of the day the creators are getting profit and the investors are not getting an actual ROI on their investment.  I&#039;m sure there are a number of good reasons, including legal ones, to not create a true investor relationship but I can&#039;t get over the hurdle of funding somebody and not getting a part of the profits after the fact.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, believe it or not...at this VERY second I am playing on a classic eq emu.  And, I happen to be tabbed out and surfing the net as I wait for hasten to spawn in rathe mountains (or more precisely, for Brother Z to despawn or be killed).  I won&#039;t say I&#039;m having a great time...and yet, I am.  I truly truly am.  I can&#039;t wait to link the jboots in guild chat and get flooded with &quot;grats&quot;  from friends.  I can&#039;t wait to get questions from folks who get stuck on a part of the quest and share with them the tricks I know that might save some time....EQ is a strange strange beast, and it still captivates me.  

It isn&#039;t just the lore...although, I have always been a lore junkie.  Lore still captivates me.  The story of Hsagra in Velious is one of the most beautiful stories I&#039;ve ever read about in any MMO.  You don&#039;t need to know it---there isn&#039;t a single &quot;quest&quot; that requires you to really know the lore.  It&#039;s easier today than it was 15 years ago, but I have a walkthru open in another window at almost all times.  I can mindlessly move from step to step, hand in to hand in, camp to camp until I finish...never once being required to really read or know anything about anything.  I can also tell you that the first time I realized that Tormax was sitting on a giant-sized throne made from the skull of Hsagra---Yelinak&#039;s mate---I was filled with real hatred to avenge my dragon friends.  Killing Tormax wasn&#039;t just about getting my flowing thought 2 booties.  But it isn&#039;t about the lore.  As you rightly pointed out, the quest system in original EQ was a mess.  There were literally hundreds of unsolved quests and quests that couldn&#039;t be finished because they were broken.  I still have Inquisitor Seru&#039;s Sword of Truth in my bag on live, hoping to someday find out what quest it is for...

Quests in EQ force players to work together on many levels.  Certainly, tactically as cooperative game play goes in any multi-player game.  But also, to truly support each other...sometimes even emotionally because the quests were just dumbly difficult or unfair.  I main a bard on the classic emo that has been waiting to get his epic for almost a year now, but Trakanon (classic, no undead bard yet) is constantly raced to by other guilds that steal him right from under me.  My guildmates know what I am thinking as they race past us to engage first or kill steal the mob away from us.  My pulse races.  My anxiety rises...I have a real physical reaction to what is going on in the game.  And, it happens very frequently in EQ.  Even the most anti-lore player can not escape this drama in classic EQ.  Drama, for all its ills, also makes worlds real.

I&#039;ll also toss this in:  I have no idea if you had any input on writing this, Moorgard.  The House of Ballads quest line from Kingdoms of Amalur is one of the best stories in any role playing game (online, solo, or real pen and paper) that I&#039;ve ever played.  This quest &quot;hooked&quot; me for sure on Amalur.  So, some players definitely thirst for this stuff.  Then again, I&#039;m always a sucker for a good story.]]></description>

Dangit Steve, make it happen! :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is good to hear. As a fellow writer myself, I understand the attachment that goes into the work - as what we do is quite a bit different than producing other types of products. Very much like art, we put a lot of ourselves into what we create. Our experiences, our perspective, and even our emotions. Getting that connection severed should definitely be a shock - especially if you were doing it right. (Hint hint, you were!)

It is good to know that EQNext will live on, as a fan of the franchise for one, but also having read the lore and invested my own time, thought, and analysis into it as well. I&#039;m actually very excited to see you blogging (I never knew this thing existed!). It would be a very convenient way to follow your work and career. While I was a bit to busy with life changes (finishing my service in the Marines, getting married, and my first kids being born) to really dive into Amalur - I was keeping a distant eye on it.

Salvatore is one of my favorite writers (though I do think his complex combat choreography is slightly less enjoyable to me than it used to be) and I (still) love his work. Makes a lot of sense why I really enjoyed the Authors you helped select for EQNext lore and the plot and stories you all crafted together. I didn&#039;t know you were on the Amalur project until after I started following you via SOE/EQN.

Best of luck to you sir. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find a new home somewhere on an exciting project. At the very least, maybe I&#039;ll get to play some EQNext with you whenever that project is complete!

Cheers,
Veluux]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, you, Jeff and Dave were my three favorite people at SOE, and I always watched the livestreams you were in. I have never even built in Landmark, but I still got so excited by watching how excited you guys always were. I guess Nova doesn&#039;t realize the value, even in terms of profit, it is to have truly invested employers. Some time ago I bought Amalur, but I didn&#039;t have time to try it out at the time, and I ended up forgetting it, but I&#039;m going to play it now that I know you&#039;ve worked on it. Excited to see where you go next! Thank you Loreguard]]></description>
