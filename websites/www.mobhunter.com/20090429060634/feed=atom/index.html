		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=475"><![CDATA[<p>Cuppy raises what she assumes will be controversial questions about game design bloggers: <strong><a title="Oh no you di'n't!" href="http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=729" target="_blank">Do they know what they&#8217;re talking about? Are they even good designers?</a></strong></p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the controversy? The answer to both questions is <strong>&#8220;Play it safe and assume not.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Which makes you wonder whether I know what I&#8217;m talking about or if I&#8217;m a good designer. And the answer to this question is that <strong>you have no way of knowing</strong>. But we&#8217;ll get to that in a minute.</p>
<p>To Cuppy&#8217;s first point, I think the proof that game designer blogs lack relevance is that 100% of them could vanish from the Internet today and the actual practice of game design would not change one bit. <strong>Not one iota!</strong></p>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t believe me and would rather hear from someone more famous who makes games and blogs, <a title="You just knew he would" href="http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=729#comment-8563230" target="_blank">Raph responded</a> with the following observations:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. There didn&#8217;t use to be so many professional designers blogging. It&#8217;s a relatively recent phenomenon.<br />
2. Even today, most designers DON&#8217;T think in terms of design theory, psychology, emotions, etc. It&#8217;s even more recent than blogging.<br />
3. There are a lot of designers who make good games of a given sort, but can&#8217;t make great ones.<br />
4. There are a lot of designers who make good games of a given sort, but it&#8217;s the only sort they can make.<br />
5. There are a lot of designers who can talk about theory but can&#8217;t develop new theory.<br />
6. There are a lot of designers who talk about theory but can&#8217;t apply it.<br />
7. There are a lot of great designers who don&#8217;t know how to express what they do.<br />
8. There are a lot of good academics and yes, other designers, who can express what great designers do in language that others can understand.<br />
9. There are a lot of really terrible game design blogs. But there are also lots of really good ones. A lot of the good ones are not by &#8220;professional game designers.&#8221;<br />
10. Often, because of points 3-8, it can be very hard to tell a good game design blog from a bad one.<br />
11. Experience is often worth listening to, even when it&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>By the way, I can&#8217;t think of very many truly &#8220;famous&#8221; game designers in game design circles who DO blog.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of those points have truth to them, but that last line is perhaps the most telling. There is something to be said for the old chestnut that if you are good at what you do, you don&#8217;t need to <em>tell </em>people that you&#8217;re good at what you do. That is to say, good designers just shut up and let their work do the talking.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get back to Cuppy&#8217;s second question and my response to it. For the most part, you have no way of judging whether or not I know what the hell I&#8217;m talking about for a couple reasons. One is that <strong>talking about theory is one thing, but implementation is quite another</strong>. That&#8217;s why incredibly smart and articulate people can fail at actually having to make games, and why some people are more famous for what they say than for actually producing quality work. It&#8217;s also a reason why many players can write blogs that are every bit as thoughtful and compelling as people in the industry&#8211;because blogging doesn&#8217;t have the accountability of meeting deadlines and budgets.</p>
<p>Another reason is that, despite the many articles I&#8217;ve written and all the interviews I&#8217;ve given, <strong>you probably don&#8217;t </strong><strong>actually </strong><strong>know what I do for a living</strong>. Nor are you likely to know what specific content or systems any game designer who blogs has actually created. You know what projects we have been attached to and can read the credits to see what titles we were given, but those things tell you almost nothing about what we actually did and whether or not it sucked.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t just make it hard to know which blogs to trust, but also to tell whether someone&#8217;s resume is worth the paper it&#8217;s printed on. There are an awful lot of terrible designers out there with game credits on their resumes who hurt the projects they worked on far more than they helped them. And these kinds of folks are sometimes willing to take credit for good work that they didn&#8217;t even do in order to land a job.</p>
<p>So unless you can point to exactly which zones a designer mapped, which quests he implemented, which dungeon he populated, which dialogue he wrote, which raid he itemized, or other specific details, you&#8217;re pretty much guessing if he&#8217;s just a good salesman or if he actually knows what he&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I do believe there is value (even sheer entertainment) in reading blogs of people making games. Just don&#8217;t take their theories for granted&#8211;pay attention to what happens when they actually have to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>Except for this blog, of course, which you can trust implicitly. But you knew that already!</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=469"><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a pretty good <a title="Ten tons seems excessive" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/66885" target="_blank">article over on Ten Ton Hammer</a> offering a look at the current state of beta testing. As many others have noted, not much testing goes on in the public stages of MMO betas, and the article offers a variety of perspectives from both developers and players.</p>
<p>My old comrade Scott Hartsman chimes in with a voluminous set of observations (without me around to edit him, Scott will just talk forever!) on how a big-budget game can manage to make it into beta and be lacking in the fun department:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a AAA game with 3-4 years of time and money invested, enough  money to support a large team having worked on it for that long.  Games like  this frequently need to go for years before enough pieces come together before  you can start making decisions about what&#8217;s fun and what isn&#8217;t.</em></p>
<p><em>By the  time beta begins, you&#8217;ve made decision after decision that have compounded on  each other.  Your assumptions&#8217; assumptions&#8217; have assumptions about what your  game is.  The whole product, systems, content, operations, marketing, PR,  community ramp, you name it &#8212; is built upon them.  Changing core assumptions  about the product itself is unlikely to be possible without significant delays,  costing progressively more money per month.  (Remember, the months toward the  end of the dev cycle are the most expensive ones by far.)</em></p>
<p><em>The game is,  for the most part, what it is.  You&#8217;re capable of making shifts, but the more  complex the game, the more minor the shifts you can make with any confidence.   If assumptions that you made years ago turn out to be wrong, you&#8217;re left to  scramble, or in most cases, do your best to ameliorate the now-certain  fallout.</em></p>
<p><em>If you haven&#8217;t verified your gameplay at the point of having a  beta, you&#8217;ve already left your fate to chance.  (This is, of course, all  presuming that your game has passed the technical bar in terms of stability,  which is all too often not the case.  And, again, is another flaw with the  launch-big-or-die model.)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The guy from <a title="Knock knock, it's the lawyers from Uglydolls" href="http://www.ohai.com/" target="_blank">ohai</a> speaks true. If you start out with mediocre core gameplay and pile tons of mediocre decisions on top of it, soon you&#8217;ll find yourself in a plate of spaghetti and weaksauce you won&#8217;t be able to escape (how&#8217;s that for mixing metaphors?). For instance, if the act of killing enemies over and over is the centerpiece of your gameplay, then you better make damn sure basic combat feels interesting and cool because otherwise nothing will be able to detract attention from the suckiness.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, I recently had a happy beta experience and felt I should share. I installed the Chinese open beta for <a title="Tower? I hope there's a mage in it" href="http://www.aiononline.com/us/" target="_blank">Aion</a> after finding instructions on how to apply an English-language patch. Considering the hoops jumped through to get the client running in English, I expected a train wreck and was hoping I could at least get a feel for the visuals and gameplay. Instead, I found myself pleasantly surprised that the language stuff worked and the game played smoothly. Though the experience wasn&#8217;t perfect, there was a thoughtful layer of polish to the UI and other elements of the game that I found refreshing. After not expecting much more than a grindfest, I&#8217;m now looking forward to the US version.</p>
<p>So beta&#8211;or live preview, or whatever you choose to call it&#8211;still has the potential to positively influence the market toward your game, so long as you when you lift your skirt what you reveal to the world is solid (ugh, that metaphor is simply uncomfortable).</p>
<p>Look, every shipped triple-A MMO is going to have bugs. These games simply have too many systems and too much content to test every possible use case before launch, and everyone from Blizzard on down spends the first few months after a major release fixing things. And players will accept that, as long as you&#8217;re up front about the issues and the core gameplay experience is rich and enjoyable enough to mitigate the bugs until they&#8217;re stomped out.</p>
<p>But public perception based on that first public showing has a measurable impact on your game&#8217;s ultimate fate.  Now more than ever, major signs of weakness are going to haunt your sales potential for eternity, and even the greatest patches can only do so much to fix that lingering initial perception.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=466"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever actually browsed your junk email folder? Sure, there&#8217;s nasty virus-laden stuff you need to watch out for, but some spammers are including a wealth of inspired writing in their messages that a student of modern poetry can&#8217;t help but find captivating.</p>
<p>Check out this gem, found in a message entitled &#8220;Restore your organs ability and productivity now&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>but let me tell you thats not how it will really go i imagine most kids will want to stay home and play computer games but their moms will make them come and so theyll grudgingly put on a some church pants and skirts so i was wondering if you could help me know how to bring the romance back into our modern life its not really that important no matter the dress or the menu we just want the kids to come to feel the spirit of the temple but its like you said anne when you dont use your imagination to make life beautiful how much you miss what an adventure it is</p></blockquote>
<p>Marvelous! This passage has a stream-of-consciousness quality to it that I admire. I knew many would-be poets at university who had no hope of matching such majesty.</p>
<p>Later in the same email, the author shifts focus to a new subject framed in the context of modern life:</p>
<blockquote><p>breakfast i always have two eggs and salsa always i dont really get sick of it and it would really stink if i did because theres not a lot out there for breakfast actually when you are at your ideal weight and ovulating regularly you can have any kind of whole grain hot cereal without a problem you know steel cut oats etc i am not quite there yet berries and grapes are pretty low on the glycemic index and i have those too oh and i love cottage cheese with fruit grant and i listened and danced to his music on valentines day</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascinating! As an audience, we are enthralled by the narrator&#8217;s candor on her eating and ovulation habits. Yet it is the hint of romance at the end of the passage which truly captivates us, leaving us to wonder as to the identity of &#8220;grant&#8221; and the mysterious composer of the music to which our protagonist danced.</p>
<p>This modern epic draws to a close with yet another slice-of-life observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>do you have to be obsessed with yarn and needles and hooks like i am to think that is the most inviting little space youve ever seen when cate is too scared to go downstairs penny will go with her and everything is all right she lets cate dress her up for weddings or try to ride her or pull her by the tail almost daily and even knowing the torture she will soon endure she gets so excited when cate gets home from school</p></blockquote>
<p>Using yarn and needles as metaphors for our fear of institutions such as weddings and school is beyond brilliant. You&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find social commentary of this caliber among today&#8217;s published so-called poets.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll realize that a wealth of reading wonder awaits in your junk folder. It is perhaps the ultimate irony that beauty and thought of this quality is being relegated to the trash bins of modern culture. The future of our society is alive and well, not within the cold walls of the classroom, but inside the nurturing womb of the spam filter.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=464"><![CDATA[<p>Lum posted articles about two GDC talks, one by <a title="A force of nature" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/03/26/barnett-does-gdc-gdc-survives-the-experience/" target="_blank">Mythic&#8217;s Paul Barnett</a> and the other by <a title="He really did write the worst quest ever" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/03/27/jeff-kaplan-does-gdc-explains-how-not-to-write-quests/" target="_blank">Blizzard&#8217;s Jeff Kaplan</a>. While the articles themselves are interesting, I found the comments sections even more enlightening.</p>
<p>In the former, you have a number of commenters saying what a blowhard Paul is, some of them implying that WAR&#8217;s subscriber numbers are an indicator that Mr. B doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>In the latter, you have a number of commenters saying what a blowhard Jeff is, some of them implying that despite WoW&#8217;s success it&#8217;s clear that Mr. K doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about.</p>
<p>Which to me is yet another amusing example of Why Devs Can&#8217;t Possibly Win. Because if you fall below some community-perceived bar of success then you are a clueless failure, and if you&#8217;re above that bar you&#8217;re out of touch and too afraid of losing profit to innovate.</p>
<p>Despite the occasional exaggeration or bluster, neither of these guys is trying to put himself atop a mountain proclaiming he has the answer to the mysteries of the universe. Ultimately, they state their opinions and observations in public forums because people ask them to. As attending or reading such presentations is an entirely optional undertaking, I find it odd that some folks seem to get angry that these guys are even allowed to speak.</p>
<p>From the <a title="Raph will think it's funny I call him mighty" href="http://www.raphkoster.com/" target="_blank">mighty</a> <a title="I could also have said &quot;blowhards&quot;" href="http://terranova.blogs.com/" target="_blank">intellectuals</a> to the <a title="The lowest of the low" href="http://www.mobhunter.com/" target="_blank">lowly bloggers</a>, we&#8217;re all just trying to inspire discussion about what works and what doesn&#8217;t so that those of us lucky enough to work in the industry can keep doing this for a living and hopefully get better at our craft. If there&#8217;s any value to be had in GDC and its ilk, it&#8217;s that. Sometimes you just have to look past a lot of bullshit to find it.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=460"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, it&#8217;s not technically <em>my </em>book per se, but I did coauthor a chapter with my old (and I do mean <em>old</em>) comrade, Tracy &#8220;Owlchick&#8221; Seamster. The book is called <em>Writing for Video Game Genres: From FPS to RPG</em>, and its contributors come from the Writers SIG of the IGDA. Our chapter is, as you might guess, about writing for MMOGs. The rest of the book covers pretty much any type of video game you can imagine.</p>
<p>Obviously the focus is on writing, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about me jamming a bunch of opinionated design theories down your throat (after all, you get those for free on this blog). If for some reason you find this book appealing, you can pad my wallet with a hefty .002 cents per copy royalty by ordering the book directly <a title="Shameless plug." href="http://www.akpeters.com/product.asp?ProdCode=4179" target="_blank">from the publisher</a>, <a title="No shame at all." href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Video-Game-Genres-FPS/dp/1568814178/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1238125481&amp;sr=1-7" target="_blank">via Amazon</a>, or <a title="Seriously, I need money." href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Writing-for-Video-Game-Genres/Wendy-Despain/e/9781568814179/?itm=1" target="_blank">from Barnes &amp; Noble</a>. Word is it may even show up in your local bookstore at some point.</p>
<p>Let me warn you ahead of time that I had to hold back a bit on some of the details I would have otherwise included had my current project been on the shelves already (have to protect the secret sauce, you know), but I think the stuff Tracy and I put together is nonetheless useful for anyone thinking of becoming a writer for an MMOG.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m most proud of the fact that I now have something tangible to show my mom to explain what I do for a living. Video games she doesn&#8217;t get, but a book she will understand.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=458"><![CDATA[<p>Battlestar Galactica&#8217;s finale has aired. It didn&#8217;t answer <a title="A good list" href="http://io9.com/5174139/12-plotholes-that-must-be-filled-in-the-battlestar-finale" target="_blank">every question we had</a>, but it resolved most of them. Perhaps more importantly, it gave us closure for the characters we&#8217;ve come to care about over the past five or so years.</p>
<p>Plenty o&#8217; spoilers after the break.<span id="more-458"></span></p>
<p>I am pleased with how they wrapped up most of the character arcs. Initially I assumed they&#8217;d kill off one or more main characters (Apollo seemed a likely candidate), but I guess Ron Moore and company preferred the soppy goodbyes.</p>
<p>Accepting the show&#8217;s answers to several of its bigger mysteries requires buying into some pseudo-religious hand waving, and I suppose I did that. The conclusion of Starbuck&#8217;s arc was fine with me (sent back from the dead to lead her people to a new Earth, and after saying goodbye to Lee she just disappears), although I guess we&#8217;ll never be sure where she got that new viper. We are left to assume that the &#8220;in the head&#8221; versions of Six and Baltar were angels of a sort, ensuring that divine will be carried out.</p>
<p>To me the real brilliance of the episode was tying the Cylon colony into the vision of the opera house. That was really well done and felt very satisfying. And I was fine with the discovery of a replacement Earth that turned out to be the planet we inhabit, although I thought it was a bit of a stretch that two planets would have the same continental configuration.</p>
<p>Though there is still one more dose of BSG in our future (&#8221;<a title="I plan to eat a burrito" href="http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b104849_edward_james_olmos_tells_future_of.html" target="_blank">The Plan</a>,&#8221; a TV movie which delves into the Cylon&#8217;s much-alluded to scheme), the show is over. I can&#8217;t help but think about how it will stack up against what I consider the landmark of episodic science fiction: <a title="The gold standard" href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html" target="_blank">Babylon 5</a>.</p>
<p>While B5 made some course corrections along the way (due mostly to cast changes and the uncertainty of whether it would be able to air a fifth season), it fulfilled the promise of playing out a complete storyline that was envisioned in advance. Its special effects are painfully dated and some of the acting is stiffer than cardboard, but the story arc told by the show was spectacular and the writing was often pure poetry.</p>
<p>In contrast, BSG had superb acting and astonishingly good special effects which I believe will hold up well for many years to come, but its writing and charaterization were spotty and it clearly wasn&#8217;t plotted out from the beginning. In the recent SyFy (/giggle) special on the show, Ron Moore even admitted they didn&#8217;t know who the final five were until the team sat down to write the episode that revealed them. As one of those guys who <em>wants to believe</em>, that kind of thing disappoints me.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s my ultimate test. When the final episode of B5 aired, I wept like a baby as a show I loved came to its conclusion and I said goodbye to some beloved characters. When the finale of BSG was done there were no tears; I was satisfied and almost relieved that the show ended without screwing anything up.</p>
<p>So when all is said and done, BSG will be a show that I greatly enjoyed but wasn&#8217;t as satisfying as it could have been. I could have lived with lower production values and a weaker cast if the show had carried through a consistent story and vision. BSG was great television, but there&#8217;s plenty of room for episodic genre fiction that reaches even greater heights.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=433"><![CDATA[<p>On RPG Vault, FusionFall&#8217;s Rich Weil outlines a lot of the reasons <a title="or should I say wishy washy" href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/962/962114p1.html" target="_blank">community management is a much more nebulous position</a> in online gaming than many other development roles. <a title="Talks more about community than most community managers" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/03/13/warcraft-killed-the-community-star/" target="_blank">Lum</a> (honorary community manager) and <a title="Likes to use the word &quot;weenies&quot;" href="http://eatingbees.brokentoys.org/2009/03/13/go-read-this-well-talk-about-afterwards/" target="_blank">Sanya</a> discuss the article and agree with most of what Rich says, and there&#8217;s not much in the piece that I would argue about either.</p>
<p>But I think there&#8217;s more to this general misunderstanding about community management than a lack of metrics or solid job descriptions. The profession also lacks a sense of history.</p>
<p>If you want to judge a designer, artist, or coder on a game he or she has worked on, you can (usually) pick up the game and evaluate it for yourself, or at the very least do some digging into reviews and feedback on the particular aspects of the game linked to this person&#8217;s efforts. To evaluate the work of a community manager, what are you going to do&#8211;dig through years of forum posts? Search out fansite interviews? Google for vague impressions?</p>
<p>The very nature of community management is that it&#8217;s <em>of the moment</em>. These moments have a cumulative effect for members of the community&#8211;they either develop a sense that the community team is listening and actively working on their behalf or decide they&#8217;re useless corporate shills&#8211;but beyond the realm of the player base and dev team, the community manager has a hard time making a clear impression. Unless you were a member of the relevant community at the time, there is little chance you&#8217;ll know anything more than third-hand rumors about what Abashi did to piss off players, or what Sanya did to make the Camelot Herald kick ass, or what Moorgard did or didn&#8217;t say about frogloks. You can read random insinuations posted on message boards by those who may or may not have been there, but often those recollections are made through the hazy veil of selective memory.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re talking about a profession that not only lacks standardized tools, job descriptions, and advancement opportunities (is there a pure community job in gaming anywhere above the director level?), but where new generations of community managers can barely get a sense of what their predecessors have done right or wrong.</p>
<p>Sure, I suppose if someone comes up with a formula for measuring exactly how a community manager&#8217;s efforts impact specific aspects of a particular product, those metrics would help justify the position to those who doubt its value, but we&#8217;ll never entirely get away from the fact that OCR is indeed a touchy-feely affair (as it should be; if it ain&#8217;t touchy-feely, it ain&#8217;t community). Personally, as much as I&#8217;d like to see the next generation of community managers armed with proper standards and metrics, I&#8217;d just as much like to see them endowed with a real sense of what went before so that they can help guide this discipline to a better future.</p>
