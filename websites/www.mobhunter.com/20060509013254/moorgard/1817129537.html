<BR>

<I><B>My character has 255 training points saved up and will level again soon. Is there any error, bug, or problem associated with having more than 256 training points?<BR>

We actually checked this just yesterday. There is no problem if there are more training points than 255.<BR>

Given that you accumulate 5 training points per level, you'd have to go 51 levels without using a training point. Many skills need a point put in them to begin learning them, and others advance so slowly or are so vital to your class that you'd be insane not to dump everything you've got into them.<BR>

The person who asked this question is either an ultra-PLed twink with no skills whatsoever or someone who hates the trainers for his class so vehemently that he's willing to walk around with virtually no class-specific skills. A more likely scenario, however, is that Ester was baited into spending 45 minutes testing and replying to an e-mail about an issue that would affect absolutely no one, ever.
