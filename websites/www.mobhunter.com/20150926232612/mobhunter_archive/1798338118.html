Well, after teasing us for weeks with text messages and hidden commands, the first version of raid exp is now on the Test server.<p>You can read <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4800">all the details</a>, but here are some noteworthy highlights:<p>- Raid leaders and raid group leaders can invite people to join the raid via a new raid window<p>- Everyone in the raid can use the /r chat channel<p>- Experience will be divided amongst members of the raid who are in range of the kill, but exp will be smaller than a single group could get (duh!)<p>- The raid leader determines who has permission to loot mob corpses<p>This system will be a huge benefit to all types of raids. In the Nagafen pickup raid, for example, you are much less likely to have some outsider swoop in and ninjaloot that Cloak of Flames--though being able to trust the raid leader is more important than ever. On uberguild raids, it won't just be those damned wizzy KS groups raking in all the exp anymore. Woohoo!<p>One would presume that the same level restrictions that apply to gaining exp in groups will also apply to raids, but we'll see soon enough.<p>I don't know how anyone who plays EQ would see raid exp as anything but a good thing, though I'm sure the system will undergo some fine tuning for a while. But in any case, the Dev Team gets a hearty thumbs up from us for finally pulling this one off.<p><BIG>More Power to You</BIG><p>Yet <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/">another chapter</a> of the Planes of Power story has unfolded over at the EQLive site. No, this one doesn't make any more sense than any of the other chapters, but you can watch the little animation and read the story anyway.<p>Expect another chapter next week, then the final installment of the story the week after.<p>You might also find this little <a href="http://www.linkdead.com/Planes Of Power 2.5.zip">movie</a> interesting. Verant sent out what amounts to a PoP commercial, but it looks pretty cool and shows some mobs in motion that we haven't seen before.<p><BIG>Here, Have a Cookie</BIG><p>Any puller knows what it's like to enter a room full of shadowknight mobs and get wasted by a couple dozen harmtouches going off all at once. Imagine the sting Absor felt, then, when his post about Spell Casting Fury and Soul Abrasion resulted in hundreds of flames from all over the SK community.<p>In a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=51975">followup message</a>, Absor responds to some of the justified outrage with good news:<p><B>We've taken a second look at these abilities and the changes we proposed making yesterday.<p>We'll be finding a way to make them stack, so that should a critical happen the Life Tap will still check for and add the effects of Soul Abrasion.<p>Thank you for all of your input on the matter.</B><p>That should let SKs rest a bit easier. Now they can stop bitching about wasting AA points and go back to complaining about not being able to tank ubermobs. Order shall return to the universe once again.<p><BIG>EuroDisney It Ain't</BIG><p>Saryahn, one of the Lead GMs for EQ in Europe, sent us a FAQ with details on how the new localized versions of EQ will work, along with fairly good news for those wanting Planes of Power outside the US:<p><B><I>What are the benefits of EverQuest European Version?</I><p>The EverQuest European Version will provide the best gaming experience to European players: <br>&middot; A professional team of 12 Game Masters present 24/7 to organize events and dynamic at more convenient hours!<br>&middot; All European EverQuest gamers will be playing in similar time zones<br>&middot; New methods of payment (national credit card, automatic debit...)<br>&middot; Hotline also accessible at European hours and at a lower cost<br>&middot; Servers located in Europe for improved connection speeds<p><I>What is the release date of EverQuest European Version?</I><p>The European Invasion is planned to begin on November, 21st. But if you want to get a pre-release go of EverQuest European Version, be sure to register to the Beta Tests which will start October 21st!  You can register to the Beta Tests through www.eqloft.com <p><I>When will EverQuest: the Planes of Power be available?</I><p>The highly anticipated EverQuest new add-on, the Planes of Power, will be available at the very same time as the other EverQuest games on November 21st. The English version of EverQuest the Planes of Power will be a dual version, allowing you to choose between playing on the US server or on the new UK server. However, please note that if you want to play The Planes of Power on both the US and the UK servers, then you will have to buy two PoP packs.<p><I>What if I already subscribe to EQ?</I><p>If you are already subscribing to EverQuest US Version and would like to play EverQuest European Version then:<br>- you will have to buy a copy of EverQuest European Version<br>- create a new account for EverQuest European version <br>- you will get one month free subscription<p>Note that you can play and subscribe both to EverQuest US and European versions at the same time, but the two versions (US and European) won't be compatible each other and you will be charged for the US and for the European version. <p><I>Will European versions be compatible with all European servers?</I><p>The different European versions of EverQuest won't be compatible each other. So, if you own a English version, you won't be able to connect to the German or French servers.<p><I>Will EverQuest European Version be a dynamic world?</I><p>Yes! Our 12 Game Masters will be connected 24/7 to provide you the best online experience you've ever had. They will be there to help as well as entertain you by creating various events, all week long... In case you need them, they will be accessible in-game and through EQLoft as well. <p><I>What does localisation mean exactly?</I><p>The interface, registration menus, in game texts (quest, items, spells,...) and chat, everything will be translated to change your way of playing MMOGs. <p><I>Will I be able to transfer my characters from the US to the new European servers?</I><p>We are seriously considering this option. But, at the moment we can't give you any details.</B><p>Some of the translation above is a bit rough, but I don't have time to fix it right now. The movie will start soon!<p>Anyway, this clarifies most of the issues that European players have been wondering about. They will still have to wait an extra month for PoP to appear on store shelves, so preordering through Verant (or having a friend in the US send a copy) is still the best way to venture to the planes alongside everyone else.<p>The Euro servers will definitely be separate from one another due to the language issues. Hopefully character transfer will be an option--I'd suggest letting Ubi Soft know if this feature would be important to you.<p>Okay, that's enough writing for today. Time to go raid the mind of a serial killer or two.
