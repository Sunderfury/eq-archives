Only myself and the petitioner.<p><LI>So I says to myself....&quot;Self? You need to edumacate this fella!&quot; :)<p><LI>(Keep in mind what the overall setting looked like: There I was, in skeleton form, carrying a scythe, FLOATING IN MIDAIR IN A MEDITATING POSITION, with a LARGE dark-brown skeleton named &quot;Gibober&quot; standing behind me. Ummm....No, skippy, I'm not a druid or a shaman.)<p><LI>I say &quot;Wish I could, bro, but I don't have SoW. I'm a Necromancer.&quot;<p><LI>The Petitioner says, &quot;$#*&amp;@#$ dick, sow me already! it's for a cr&quot;</I></UL><p>You won't believe where this thing ends up. Read the whole <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forumsnew/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=5606&amp;FORUM_ID=1&amp;CAT_ID=1&amp;Topic_Title=%22d00d+sow+plz%22%3A++Discovery+of+the+%27%2Fwho%27+Bug%2E&amp;Forum_Title=General+Discussions">story</a> and be prepared to bust a gut laughing. It's a doozy.<p>Too crazy to be true? Maybe. But I wouldn't put anything past an eBay n00b (which is, by the way, the very worst kind of n00b).<p>After you're finished, enjoy a nice <a href="http://www.tahnlu.com/noobie/noobiebegger.html">movie</a>. (I hope at least one of those links works--I think GeoCities might be screwing with them.)<p>Just call it n00b day here at Mobhunter.
