The estimated downtime is 1 hour. We apologize for the inconvenience.<p>The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>No real word on what caused the downtime, but ubermobs that didn't get ganked right away received a pardon from the governor. The emergency patch that was supposed to last 60 minutes ended up being more like three hours, and things still don't seem quite right. Consider the following excerpt from my log:<p>[Mon Feb 25 21:20:29 2002] You have slain a coldain wolfmaster!<br>[Mon Feb 25 21:20:29 2002] Your faction standing with Coldain got worse.<br>[Mon Feb 25 21:20:29 2002] Your faction standing with Coldain got worse.<br>[Mon Feb 25 21:20:29 2002] Your faction standing with Coldain got better.<br>[Mon Feb 25 21:20:29 2002] Your faction standing with Coldain got better.<p>Uh, let's hope another emergency patch isn't in the works. My heart can't take the strain.<p><BIG>Those 120 Points You Have? Well, They're a Bug</BIG><p>If you were wondering what the heck the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1056665184">patch message</a> meant when it talked about &quot;fixing&quot; the amount of alternate experience you get, Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000503.html">clarified things</a> a bit:<p><B>When soloing with 100% of incoming experience going to Alternate Advancement, characters were getting more experience than they had earned. This was a bug.<p>When grouped with less than 100% of incoming experience going to Alternate advancement, characters were getting less experience than they had earned. This, too, was a bug.</B><p>This pretty much confirms what many people suspected: depending on the zone you were in and group makeup, it was actually better exp to solo. The patch changes this, of course. Wizards are <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=13320.topic">reporting</a> that solo exp has been cut by 22% or so--and that sucks.<p>We all know that Verant encourages you to group rather than solo (ask any necro if you need confirmation), but this change is taking things too far. Luclin has been out almost three months, and it took that long to fix this &quot;bug&quot;? Come on. Even if soloers got more exp than intended, the increased downtime most classes experience when soloing offset that. Sure, there are people botting four computers simultaneously to PL one character, but they'll still come out ahead anyway. This change mostly hurts the poor schmucks who don't have much time to hunt for groups, or who don't have a lot of time to play, period.<p>But lest you think that's the only nerf for soloers this patch...<p><BIG>Mushrooms Get Spicier</BIG><p>Looks like Fungus Grove has gotten <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10007.topic">nerfed</a> yet again. When Luclin first opened, this zone was ridiculous; ultra-fast spawn times and wimpy mobs that dropped lots of spells meant that the zone could successfully keep 80-100 people occupied. A while back, both spawn times and item drops were decreased, and lately the zone sees much less traffic. Still, it was a nice place for melee to solo, thanks to mushrooms that cast a lot and didn't land spells very often.<p>Until now.<p>The &quot;Shrieker's Curse&quot; spell that mushrooms proc--a 200 pt. direct damage spell that turns you into a giant mushroom-- is now nearly impossible to resist, even with well over 100 disease resistance. Thus the zone is dead to melee soloers, and perhaps even quad-kiting wizards will have problems. Ironically, maybe the only group that won't hate the zone now is AoE types--a setup Verant worked very hard to make non-viable in Luclin.<p>The combination of changes to the AAXP system is going to turn many players off, and will only fuel the &quot;Verant gives advantages to the people who get there first&quot; crowd.<p>Ah well, what's a patch without stealth nerfs and random bitching.<p><BIG>How Do You Spell...</BIG><p>One of our readers, Remelio Gemweaver of Tarew Marr, was nice enough to send us info on what changes were made in the spdat file: <p><B>Erud Crossing and Marauder's Mire teleport locations changed (loc is neg 1781 x pos 953 for any of you legendary people)<p>Ancient: Legacy of Blades and Ancient: Starfire of Ro were changed into copies of a low level dru / rng spell for no apparent reason and then copied into new locations.  I guess they figure if they don't see them at first maybe they'll quit complaining?<p>Lots of cazic-thule goodness, including an effect that banishes you into the feerrott (loc neg 1450 x neg 110)<p>Also a spell that slows you, but gives you a 700 pt per tick regen - either that's bugged or they're goofy.  Probably both<p>Also what looks like a trap that turns you into a skeleton and possibly either mez's you or fears you going by the description, nothing in the spell effect about that though.<p>New is a spell called Corpse Breath which is a self only water breathing for necros (24) and shadowknights (49) - probably for those places where DMF is turned off.</B><p>Thanks, Remelio! Your name is in lights, as promised. Sounds like some interesting spell changes, especially related to the revamped Cazic-Thule. Speaking of which...<p><BIG>Legends Live, Blah Blah Blah</BIG><p>Stormhammer--the new Legends server--went live today, we hear. Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000498.html">answers more questions</a> about it, or you can read a <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4128">Q &amp; A</a> session, if there's anything about this server you don't know yet and want to.<p>In addition to the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-552675241">new zone</a> that Legends players have access to, they will be the first to experience (read: beta test) the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1899867411">revamped Temple of Cazic-Thule</a>. If you ask me, I'm more interested in the latter than the former, especially with Fungus Grove out of the exp picture. Hopefully the &quot;ghetto&quot; servers see these changes soon.<p>If not, well, at least we have emergency patches.
