So far it&#039;s come in handy once:  kid&#039;s teacher was doing a segment on Beowulf so I took another section they were studying and recorded it so the class could hear what it was supposed to sound like.

Not exactly Prof. Tolkein&#039;s thundering introduction to the subject, but worth something maybe.

I don&#039;t drop by here often so I hope this finds you and Mr. Garibaldi well.]]></description>
