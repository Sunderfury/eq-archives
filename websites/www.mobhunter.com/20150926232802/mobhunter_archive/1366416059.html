<html><head><title>Obligatory Lameness</title></head><body><h1>Obligatory Lameness</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-11-01</p>My, how time flies! It was a few days ago already that Absor posted about Verant's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000367.html">plan</a> to save Sullon Zek:<p><B>Soon, most likely on November 6th barring any problems popping up, we'll be making some changes to Sullon Zek: 1) Experience loss (on all deaths) will be cut in half. 2) There will be an across the board 20% experience bonus for NPC kills.</B><p>Help me out here... is Sullon Zek the <a href="http://www.retrocrush.com/costumes/">roleplaying</a> server, that whack team server, or the one with <a href="http://pub47.ezboard.com/flegionsofdarkness29128frm8.showMessage?topicID=397.topic">gnome monks</a> on it? I can't keep these damn things straight anymore.<p>I know it isn't the Euro server, because Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000368.html">talked</a> about that one separately:<p><B>As you have already seen by the announcement on our EverQuest Live site, we will be opening the Antonius Bayle server for our European players on November 1, 2001. We will be opening a move log from all servers to the new server on November first. We will be giving priority to European players when we move characters, and we will only be accepting a limited number of moves. Obviously we want this server to be used primarily by our European players and we don't want to move so many characters to the server that it becomes too crowded.<p>Here is a schedule for the movelog.<p>11/1/01 - Thursday at 8 am (pst) - Movelog opens.<br>11/5/01 - Monday at 8 am (pst) - Movelog closes.<br>11/6/01 - Tuesday - Moves begin and characters start becoming available to play.<br>11/7/01 - Wednesday - We expect to finish moving the characters and have them all available to play.<p>Due to the sheer volume of players that we expect will be putting in a request to move, we expect to have to cut the list short. Again, priority will be given to European players on a first come, first served basis.</B><p>If you're an American player and want to give yourself a new challenge, /movelog your character over and enjoy the same lag that Euro players have put up with for two years. Plus, with the time difference, you might be able to set your guild up with the ability to KS every ubermob before the regular population is even awake. Then again, you might screw yourself over and never even see an <a href="http://www.billingsgazette.com/archive.php?section=breaking&amp;display=/rednews/2001/03/08/build/breaking/0ronald.inc">ubermob</a> again. You'll have to work that Greenwich Mean Time stuff out yourself.<p>You want more <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000370.html">downtime</a>? You got it.<p>First, a patch that will affect everyone:<p><B>On Wednesday, November 7th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 7 hours.</B><p>Next, server-specific outages, some before the patch and some after:<p><B>On Monday, November 5th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), the Ayonae Ro server will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. The estimated downtime is 6 hours.<p>On Tuesday, November 6th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), the Zebuxoruk server will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. The estimated downtime is 4 hours.<p>On Thursday, November 8th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), the Firiona Vie server will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. The estimated downtime is 4 hours.</B><p>Break out the plows and let the farming begin.<p>Lastly, we have a bit of an incident over on Slow News Day. Snowspinner wrote a <a href="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=89">story</a> centering on some rumors heard from a Verant employee. The gossip included layoffs, Brad's departure, and staff reshuffling. It was a rather bleak piece, really, and though SND (and LtM before it) is well known to be a rabble rouser, this story was bordering on <a href="http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/MGA2KYTDGTC.html">questionable</a>.<p>Verant's own John Smedley was not a fan it either, and fired off a rather angry letter that Snowspinner posted in the <a href="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=91">followup</a> story. Smed's words caused an epiphany of sorts in Snow, who examined the first story again and agreed that it crossed the lines of responsible reporting (coincidentally, a topic I <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=1932999796">touched on</a> earlier this week). Snowspinner sums it up pretty well:<p><B>Verant really seems to be trying to change their customer service, and a lot of things in their company to better serve the customers. I'm glad. But it's a hard road. The GMs at Verant, by all appearances, really do get shat on, whether by their bosses or by the players... My rumor mongering does nothing to help... And so I'm sorry for that.</B><p>Of course, a few rabid rant fans gave Snow a roasting in the SND forums, but there is a certain crowd of controversy-hungry readers that see any use of reason or respect to be a sign of weakness. Convinced that Verant is actually evil and out to get them, these folks won't understand concepts like fairness in reporting or other issues that Snow touched on. And that's too bad. Not unexpected... but still, too bad.<p>Okay kiddies, go stuff yourself with tainted <a href="http://www.brunching.com/toys/toy-candybarmath.html">candy</a> until we post our Halloween events summary.
