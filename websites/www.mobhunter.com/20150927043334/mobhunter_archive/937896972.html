(SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming, today announced deals with Snowblind Studios Inc. and Rapid Eye Entertainment Inc. to create original content for the PC and console markets under the SOE label.   Rapid Eye Entertainment is currently developing a real-time strategy, PC-based EverQuest&reg; game while Snowblind Studios is developing an EverQuest-based product for the PlayStation&reg;2 computer entertainment system.  Further product information will be announced at a later date.<br> <br>&quot;We've made it a point to work closely with leading developers to create the best possible gaming experience,&quot; said Russell Shanks, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Sony Online Entertainment.  &quot;As we expand our product line into new genres, our mission is to deliver compelling content and online capabilities to PC and console systems worldwide.&quot;<p>Combining the experience and the expertise of the SOE development team with other top developers opens the market to new possibilities in gaming.  By expanding into new genres of gaming, SOE is well poised to take advantage of the rapidly growing market that recently broke new ground in entertainment by surpassing movie box office receipts. <p>Founded by Mark Caldwell in June 2001, Rapid Eye Entertainment (www.rapideyegames.com) is a game developer dedicated to expanding gameplay and pioneering new game genres. Caldwell was an original member and leader of the team behind the highly acclaimed Might and Magic&reg; series of role-playing games and the Heroes of Might and Magic&reg; series of turn-based strategy games. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., the company's initial focus is a unique twist in the real-time strategy category. <p>&quot;Rapid Eye is dedicated to working on the cutting edge of gaming,&quot; said Mark Caldwell, founder and president, Rapid Eye Entertainment. &quot;Our partnership with Sony Online Entertainment allows us to work on projects that will change the face of gaming, delivering great new content to a broader group of gamers.&quot;<p>Snowblind Studios, best known for the development of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, a widely successful role playing game for the PlayStation&reg;2 system, is an award-winning entertainment software company founded by industry veterans Ryan Geithman and Brian Sostrom in 1997. Based in Bellevue, Washington, Snowblind Studios has developed titles for Nintendo 64 and the PlayStation&reg;2 system.  <br>&quot;EverQuest has taken the world by storm,&quot; said Ryan Geithman, president, Snowblind Studios.  &quot;We're excited to be working with Sony Online Entertainment to expand the EverQuest phenomenon to new platforms and new audiences.&quot;</B>	<p>That's a lot of hot air, but it comes down to two distinct points:<p>- Rapid Eye Entertainment is currently developing a real-time strategy, PC-based EverQuest&reg; game.<p>- Snowblind Studios is developing an EverQuest-based product for the PlayStation&reg;2 computer entertainment system.<p>The PS2 game is not the aforementioned EverQuest Online Adventures, by the way.<p>So what's the deal? Sony is expanding its franchise, pure and simple. Like <I>Star Trek,</I> EverQuest is becoming a brand name. Old EQ is like the Original Series, and the various expansions are like the movie installments. In a year or so we will have EverQuest 2, which can be thought of as <I>The Next Generation.</I> The PS2 game may end up like <I>Deep Space Nine,</I> the underappreciated stepchild that didn't get much attention but was actually the smartest and best-written of the bunch. Hopefully these two new games won't be the <I>Voyager</I> and <I>Enterprise</I> of the family, with hackneyed plots and cardboard characters.<p>Oh my god... did I just use an extended Star Trek metaphor? I think I hear the geek alarm going off.<p>Anyway, since these games are basically outsourced to third parties, we don't have to worry about Verant's resources being strained too thin by the new additions. As to whether they will be any good or not, well, we have to wait and see. Hopefully SOE isn't pimping out the EverQuest name without some quality behind it.<p>Live long and prosper.<p><BIG>Those Irresistable Pets</BIG><p>Rich Waters stopped by the necro and mage forums to <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=6152">deliver some news</a> on a rather significant change to caster pets:<p><B>We've had a change up on Test for about a week, and I wanted to share it with you guys and see what you think. Here's the basis of the change -<p><I>When a pet is hit with a spell, it uses the resistances and level of it's owner to see if it resists the spell.</I><p>This means that if you're a level 60 magician for instance and you've got on various buffs and gear that raise your resistances, your pet will save vs. spells as if it was also level 60 with your exact resistance scores.<p>Using the owner's level is going to make a huge difference in how well the pet resists harmful spells, and should make a noticeable difference in how well the pets can survive AEs for instance. Allowing the pet to also benefit from your items and buffs means that it will be living a lot longer when fighting casters.<p>There is a drawback to this, although I think the good outweighs the bad. If we go with this new scheme, it will mean that the pet always uses the owner's saves. Some types of pets currently are highly resistant to poison or disease for instance. Going with the new scheme would mean they will potentially not resist those types of spells as well, depending on the owner's resistances.<p>Overall, this change would mean that pets are much more resistant the vast majority of the time. I think this would be a very positive change for pet classes, but I'd like to see what people think before we go ahead with it.</B><p>Nerfo--cough--necromancers <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=5728.topic">and mages</a> are pretty excited about this change, as pets are notorious for falling victim to the AE spells of ubermobs. Pets usually fall into the category of &quot;acceptable losses&quot; on raids because they can't defend themselves well against such <a href="http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_629979.html?menu=news.weirdworld.badtaste">attacks</a>.<p>The downside that Waters mentions does raise some concerns. There is a mob for the shaman epic in City of Mist which all but requires the use of mage fire pets due to their invulnerability to fire-based attacks, as players of that level have a hard time dealing with an 1100-point fire AE. Hopefully this inherent immunity won't be affected by the change in resistances.<p>The biggest boost from this change really comes from using the level of the owner in the pet's saving throw. Far more than the numerical value of a given resistance, level plays a huge part in whether you resist a spell or not.<p>Expect pets to be leading Vex Thal raids very soon.<p><BIG>While You Were Sleeping</BIG><p>Verant snuck an emergency patch on us last night, as mentioned on the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/network_status.jsp">Network Status</a> page:<p><B>On Thursday, July 18th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a brief update. The estimated downtime is 1.5 hours.</B><p>No new files were sent, and the patch was done on short notice, so somebody must have been duping plat in Greater Faydark again. Damn Verant for foiling my evil schemes!
