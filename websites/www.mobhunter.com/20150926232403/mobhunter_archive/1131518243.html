<html><head><title>Comes the Inquisitor</title></head><body><h1>Comes the Inquisitor</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-04-04</p><BIG>Que Seru Seru, Whatever Will Be Will Be</BIG><p><a href="http://www.fohguild.org/index.php">Fires of Heaven</a>, the guild loved and admired by legions of adoring fans, finally took down one of the last remaining ubermobs in the game--Lord Inquisitor Seru. For those of you following the story of Luclin, Seru is like Big Brother, John Ashcroft, and Tipper Gore all rolled into one, trying to impose his twisted ideals of purity upon the masses. In other words, seeing him receive a <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/news/2002/0403/1362902.html">critical beatdown</a> is a good thing.<p>The lewtz, of course, were suitably phat. Aside from a <a href="http://fohguild.org/news/BBoSeru.jpg">bitchin' sword</a> no one can use, there were nice boots, a ring, and whatnot. Whether these rewards were worth the hours and hours of questing needed to obtain keys to Seru's chamber and the bane weapons necessary to do any damage to the big guy is something you'll have to ask Furor and co.<p>Interestingly, it was only days ago that FoH was calling Seru unkillable. Whether Verant decided to gimp the Inquisitor or the kids in FoH just figured out a l337 new tactic is uncertain, but the ultimate result is the same.<p>Here at Mobhunter, we think it's worth <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=15041.topic">talking about</a> when an ubermob dies for the first time, but please, when Seru starts dying on your server (tee-hee), spare us the notification e-mail. If you want to beat your chest about how uber your server is, post it in the appropriate EQ Vault forum, thx.<p>In other ubermob news, <a href="http://www.drow.org/news.shtml">Blood of the Spider</a> is claiming that they completed the Vulak ring of fire in NToV, only to have Veeshan's little love puppet be a no-show:<p><B>Vulak RoF was completed by us on Thursday. Went through all of the waves then BAM! Nothing. Not a damn thing happened. If I wanted blue balls I would have gone to Amanda's house and dry humped for about an hour, but I try to avoid BB since its a shitty feeling. But in the case, &quot;Vulak RoF is working&quot;. Lies.</B><p>Well, that's disappointing, especially for guilds who still had legitimate hopes of encountering Vulak (I'll spare you my personal sob story here). I'm sure BotS were suitably annoyed as well--that RoF in Vulak's dorm room is no picnic.<p><BIG>The Drudge Report</BIG><p>Gamespy has some new <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/screenshots.asp?id=3224">screenshots</a> of the upcoming sequel to Asheron's Call, imaginatively titled Asheron's Call 2 as far as I know.<p>Ordinarily, a sequel to a ho-hum game wouldn't even merit a blip on the radar, but these screenshots are, uh, pretty damn nifty. Nice rounded models, great scenery, and diverse monster types--you'd never know this had anything to do with the original game.<p>Don't get me wrong--AC had a couple neat ideas, like the fealty system and the notion of truly dynamic content. But characters looked stupid, and those little drudge monsters were everywhere... it was a visual nightmare. Fancy graphics don't guarantee a good game, just as crappy graphics don't mean a <a href="http://www.thechosen.com/news/fullnews.cgi?newsid1017352810,85187,">bad one</a>, but screenshots like these ensure that AC2 will at least deserve a peek when it sees the light of day.<p><BIG>Very Crafty, Mr. Thule</BIG><p>The saintly people at <a href="http://www.EQTraders.com">EQ Traders</a> have posted some <a href="http://www.EQTraders.com/secrets/recipes_cazicthule.htm">new trade skill recipes</a> coming out of the revamped Temple of Cazic Thule. Why do I call them saintly? Because you need the patience of one to put as much effort into figuring this stuff out as these folks do. While much improved since the early days, EQ's trade skill system has never been particularly joyful to work with.<p>Then again, I'm not much of a trade skill guy myself--I stick to the &quot;kill&quot; part. Some people love baking and brewing and smithing, and get a lot of satisfaction out of it. Me, I make my own javelins, and I'm happy with that.<p><BIG>Have You Hugged a Mobhunter Today?</BIG><p>In our continuing efforts to make Mobhunter a hipper place to hang out, Kohath performed a patch in the wee hours of the morning that changed a few things on our site. Most of it is behind-the-scenes code improvements that you and I won't really notice, but the most visible difference is that you can now see on the home page how many comments each story has. Not that this is a particularly innovative change, of course, but we'll toot our own horn a bit since there isn't much news anyway.<p>If you have never read our little <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/contact-us.jsp">contact page</a>, you might not be aware that Mobhunter is 100% home-grown code, written by Kohath and Csenicier (see, they really <I>DO</I> have functions here). I just write stuff and make design suggestions, then try to motivate their sorry behinds to actually make the changes I propose. Let me assure you, the phrase &quot;that feature is working as intended&quot; isn't exclusive to Verant, my friends.<p>So if you have design suggestions--such as, say, an <B>article archive page</B> or a <B>site search</B> feature--you should send e-mails to both <a href="mailto:kohath@mobhunter.com">Kohath</a> and <a href="mailto:csenicier@mobhunter.com">Csenicier</a> urging them to make it all happen. Go on, mail them--they like the attention.
