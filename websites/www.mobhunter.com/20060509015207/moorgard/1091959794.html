Behold the wonders that await us all:<p><B>Upcoming for August 6th, 2003<p>It's been a little hectic around here lately, with all the Live, Legends and expansion work going on.  We're busy in that good way, where you get a lot done every day but tomorrow there's just as much to do.<p>New adventure unearthed in Lavastorm!  In the depths of the Lavastorm mountains there is only one ruler.  But even his burning breath and power have their limits.  Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach.  These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden.  Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value.  Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself.  But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted.  Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?<p>We will be adding platinum to the Shared Bank.  In order to allow folks to transfer money between characters on the same account in the same way that they can now transfer items, we will be adding a spot in the Shared Bank for placing platinum.<p>New filters and chat message options will be added.  We have separated pet melee messages into their own category.  You will be able to send them to whichever chat window you want, or filter them out completely in the Options window.  We have also added the ability to send /random messages to any chat window you'd like.  There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, you can't claim that you didn't see the /random that you lost just to force a re-roll).<p>New fletching recipes will be added.  We're adding a few new fletching recipes.  The resultant items will only be usable by Rangers that worship Karana, and will be comparable to their Tunare counterparts.<p>Guktan Illusion will be implemented.  Yup, the long-awaited new illusions will be available.  While the old Illusion: Froglok spell is just as popular as ever, folks have been asking for an illusion based on the new Froglok models.  After our next update, both will be available.<p>Adding summoned Burning Affliction items to the Magician's arsenal.  Four new summoned items with the new Burning Affliction focus ability will be introduced.  This rounds out the Magician's ability to create summoned focus items.<p>/memspellset command will be added.  This new command will allow you to memorize the spell set you indicate (using the corresponding number) from the command line or from a hot button.<p>Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.<br> <br>EQUI_BankWnd.xml<br>EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml<br>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml</b><p>As I've said before, I was a SolB guy (rather than a Guk guy) back in the day, so I love the idea of additional content being added to the Lavastorm area. There are some unused zoneline areas in SolA and SolB, so that could be a possibility. The Morden character was the one used to introduce the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/lore.jsp?page=LDON%20Lore%20Index">lore</a> around the Chardok pocket zone, so maybe this storyline indicates another temporary adventure area rather than a permanent zone.<p>The shared plat slot has been kicking around on Test for a while, and it's obviously a good thing. The less potential for scams, the better.<p>The new filters are great. I have to assume that the pet melee filter is being added solely to accommodate <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-389211046">my needs</a> since obtaining my pet weapon. Mages, necros, and enchanters can all send me a vote of thanks! Next they really need to add a filter for food and drink consumption, because those AE food/drink summons and the resulting chomping/slurping are really annoying.<p>DoT casters will be pumped about the availability of new Burning Affliction items from their local mage. There are only a handful of items currently in game with this effect, so it's definitely a change that was needed until itemization can catch up.<p>Fletching, frogs, and spellset junk round out the changes, and are all fine additions. The team usually likes to sneak in a few extras into the patch as well, so the magic of August 6 shouldn't be completely spoiled by this info.<p>The <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/future_plans.jsp">Future Plans</a> page also saw a bit of an update, but only in one little area:<p><B>Plane of Mischief changes going to the Legends server later next month.  The Plane of Mischief is the home of the trickster, Bristlebane.  One of the most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone is in need of a revamp.  We're looking at it now and plan to have changes ready for Legends later in August.  We'll be keeping the wacky style of the place while at the same time making it a bit more playable.</b><p>This tidbit makes me cringe. I'm absolutely convinced that nothing the devs do to this zone will ever make the hardcore Mischief freaks happy. No zone in the history of EQ has engendered such bitterness and resentment. Sure, it fell victim to nerf after nerf to the point that it wasn't fun anymore, but usually at that point players would give up and leave the zone alone. For whatever reason, the fanaticism around PoM just will not die, and I guess the team finally gave in. But I fully expect that whatever changes are made will fall short of the dreams of Bristlebane devotees.<p>All the other old topics are still on the table, including the melee balance thing (as every melee-oriented message board has already pointed out). You'd think people were getting impatient or something.<p>Anyway, we'll update our Next Scheduled Patch link when we know the time and duration. Until then, enjoy the anticipation.
