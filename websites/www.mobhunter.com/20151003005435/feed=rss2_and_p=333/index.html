		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Back then there were only so many ways to communicate incognito, and now there are virtually limitless ways.&quot;

Which is what they&#039;re looking into, as games can be just another one of those new-fangled ways to communicate.

In the dark ages when I was in military intelligence, we played lots of war games that had a lot of D&amp;D elements, with random dice rolls and the whole bit. During one exercise the OPFOR commander (for whom one of my buddies was providing virtual commo support) came to our table and yelled at us for lousy rolls! Needless to say, the next time it was time to roll for his result, my buddy &quot;happened&quot; to roll snake eyes which cause that commander to lose a unit.

Nowadays, they can do all this sort of stuff without actual dice, using computer games. If folks choose WoW as their medium, that&#039;s part of the new ways to plan and get together with people from all over, for whatever purpose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re a little off the mark here Moorgard.  The military GETS games- both as entertainment, as training, and as public relations.  They&#039;re not fearmongering the games, they&#039;re trying to learn more of them.  Heck, they have an office dedicated to it now.   They&#039;re funding heavily in learning games and in establishing the standards for integrating game engines with simulation.   Heck, the marine corps is developing what&#039;s essentially a &quot;level editor&quot; easy enough for the basic jarhead squad leader to use for virtual sand tables.  They gave there.com (I think) tech to research building fast virtual world models for anywhere in the world.

These guys get games.  They enjoy games.  They see the value in games and they USE games.  

When you do that, and your job involves a healthy dose of paranoia, the next question has to be, &quot;Are THEY using them too?  How?&quot;]]></description>

Yeah I know about WWII broadcasts and such, but this is a different era. Back then there were only so many ways to communicate incognito, and now there are virtually limitless ways.

The first few slides of the presentation make sense, but using WoW as an example just smacks of buying into the fear mongering of those who don&#039;t understand computer games.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually...while it sounds somewhat far-fetched, I think what that guy was getting at is that is that modern warfare includes pop culture elements that might provide useful plan concealment opportunities. If you speak in what will pass as &quot;the In lingo&quot; to most unfamiliar ears it will still sound like gibberish and go undetected.

Kind of like in WWII when the French Resistance would broadcast what sounded like weather or farm-related statements that were really code speak for their operations. &quot;Who *cares* how many cows are in the back 40 at midnight!?&quot; said some later unemployed German broadcast analyst . :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That. Is. Sad.

Ali Akbar doesn&#039;t care about some MMO fantasy world.  Hell, they have enough problems with getting people and resources here.  I would be more concerned with them manipulating American lives.  &quot;The Terrorist Without a Face.&quot;

Even IF they trained online, it wouldn&#039;t be anywhere near what they&#039;d face in a realistic scenario.   That&#039;s like Jack Thompson arguing that FPS game, like Doom, actually train people how to accurately shoot a weapon.  Uh, ok. Someone grab the dummy stick.]]></description>
