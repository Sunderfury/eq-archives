Some Planar Tailoring can only be done in the Tanaan Loom as opposed to the Planar Sewing Kit.  Nothing that was previously made in the Loom was added to the collapsible tailoring kit.  Skills changed were Baking, Sewing, Jewel Craft, and Fletching.<br>- Added gnome cultural recipe book to Ak'Anon.<br>- Changed the weights on Spiritstones to be more in line with Faithstones.<br>- Changed Collapsible Jeweler's Kit to 6 slots from 4.<p>** Zones **<p>- Grummus is much more likely to stay in his home.<br>- Fixed the door to the Ak'Anon zoo, by request of the Zookeeper's Union #23.<br>- Newly created Wood Elf Druids will now make their first appearance in the world much closer to their guild master.<br>- Fennin Ro is now more durable, more in line with the other elemental plane gods.<br>-Rallos Zek now moves considerably faster then before, as do his cohorts. He will also become very, VERY angry should he be removed from his lair(s).  <br>- Skyshrine will once again require a key for exit into the Cobalt Scar.  The fact that the key was not needed was a bug.  We do understand that few people actually walk through this area considering the other methods of transport available, but the dragons aren't leaving their doors open.<p>** Items **<p>- Corrected the inventory icon for the Acrylia Studded Legs and the Two-Handed Practice Sword.</B><p>I thought it would be fitting if SOE decided to give me a birthday present by including some kind of monk upgrade in this patch, but I guess there will be no presents for Moorgard today. Oh well. :(<p>Wizards, however, are prancing about due to the <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=24684.topic">giantsbane fix</a>, which was indeed a long time in coming.<p>Gnomes not only get cultural armor, but also a fixed door in the zoo. Grats nomes!<p>A few bosses in the Planes of Power saw some changes. Grummus probably isn't pullable outside his castle anymore, Fennin Ro in the Plane of Fire might no longer be dying to guilds on their first try, and Rallos Zek is going to yell at players who try to sploit him. Grats PoP mobs!<p>There might be some confusion with the <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=36751.topic">files being downloaded</a> in this patch. Some folks seem to be getting a new inventory window with a charm slot included (potentially screwing up custom UIs, as feared) while others are getting the bigger bank window. I thought I saw the bank being downloaded on Tuesday, but maybe in my groggy state I'm misremembering something. It's possible the same files aren't getting patched in the same order... tough to say.<p>For the most part this wasn't a huge patch, but there was enough stuff included that people shouldn't complain about the additional downtime too much. Maybe.<p><BIG>Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Shamans</BIG><p>Absor made a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=54010">clarification</a> the other day about something that was missed in Tuesday's patch message:<p><B>With the patch on February 4th we fixed a bug with Affliction foci, but we failed to mention it in the patch message. We corrected a bug that was allowing these foci to work for too many spell types, including things like snares and slow. Affliction foci now only work on damage over time spells. <p>We apologize for not mentioning this fix in the patch message. <p>The very high savings in cast time and mana, as well as the extended duration, were planned to only work on damage over time spells. These spells needed more help than all other detrimental spells. The affliction foci for haste and mana are dramatically better (more than twice as effective) than other items of the type. The extension focus is better than any other as well, though not to such a degree. These items are only so much better than others because they were intended only to improve the effect of damage over time spells to bolster their value. <p>We fixed a similar bug in June of 2002. Some time between then and now the bug resurfaced. The bug was fixed while another was being addressed, and because it wasn't the targeted bug fix it didn't make it into the patch message. We certainly wouldn't have left this information out on purpose. <p>We understand that this change has an effect on some players. But these foci have always been intended to work exclusively on DoT spells, and we do not plan to undo the bug fix. We'll look at other detrimental spells and see if there are some lines that should benefit from similar focus items, but that will be done on a case-by-case basis and not by reverting this recent bug fix.</B><p>The <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=a8ff0474113c4ae38aea64778e7b386c&amp;threadid=10593">response from the shaman community</a> was loud and immediate: the vast majority are outraged by this change. Some players have spent the better part of nine months (and copious amounts of platinum) planning their gear around obtaining these focus effects in order to benefit spells like debuffs, slows, and roots. With other changes since PoP's release that have negatively impacted the role of shamans, many are throwing in the towel out of frustration.<p>Yeah, I know, people say that all the time, but in this case it's more than usual.<p>Enchanters are also <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=82936">feeling the impact</a> of this change, as the Affliction focus was benefiting their charms and debuffs as well. Other effects (such as <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3540&amp;source=Test">Focus of Solusek</a>) do still benefit these types of spells, but items with this effect are fairly rare.<p>If you look back at the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-598664989">June patch message</a> to which Absor refers, you will indeed see the following:<p><B>- Spell duration foci designed to affect DoTs (the Affliction line) should now work reliably. <p>- The Affliction focus line should now only be affecting spells that do damage.</B><p>Sure enough, Alan is correct in saying that the Affliction line was never meant to affect spells like debuffs and charms, and the fact that they were doing so was a bug. While it took an <I>awfully</I> long time to be fixed, that doesn't change the facts. Players who take advantage of an obvious bug, regardless of their motives, have to live with the consequences if and when that bug is fixed.<p>That said, I have to agree with the shamans when they say how horribly this situation was dealt with, and SOE <I>really</I> needs to stop handling problems this way.<p>I'm not arguing against fixing bugs and exploits. These things <I>have to</I> be fixed for the good of the game, even if it means players lose something. But communication about these kinds of things needs to improve about 1000% on Verant's part.<p>When you go nine months without fixing a bug, players stop thinking of it as a bug and start to see it as a feature (insert old programmer joke here). They come to accept it as just a part of the game, making character decisions based upon that bug being the status quo. While this is presumptuous of players, they can't really be blamed for doing so.<p>It is completely unreasonable for SOE to mention something in a patch <B>nine months ago</B> and expect people to remember it. When it was clear that this bug had resurfaced (again, MONTHS ago) somebody at Verant should have mentioned that this was due to be fixed. Give players some time to prepare for it--don't just pull the rug out from under them. There was plenty of opportunity for Alan to pop into a Crucible thread and say, &quot;Look guys, please be aware that the Affliction focus was never meant to affect anything besides DoTs. We will be fixing this in the near future, so be aware that the change is on its way.&quot; While there would probably be just as much bitching, at least players couldn't complain that the fix came out of nowhere.<p>This should have been done for wizards and monks a while back, and it should have been done in this case. What makes this whole mess even worse is that the fix wasn't mentioned in the patch message. How many times do major changes get omitted from patch messages? Far too often. No, I don't think it's done maliciously, but it's way, way too sloppy to be acceptable.<p>If this change was a fix to an AA skill, players would see points refunded. Given the fact that players have spent lots of time and money investing in items like the Circlet of the Falinkan and Ceramic Skulls of Decay specifically to benefit debuffs, charms, and slows, these items should be tradable (or craftable) into items with identical stats but a focus effect that would impact the desired spells--maybe a toned-down version of Focus of Solusek or something.<p>The vast majority of players really didn't know this was a bug that was due to be fixed. Making them suffer for it as if they had been consciously exploiting something is wrong, especially when game balance wasn't cited as a mitigating factor in the decision to make the change.<p>I'm sorry, shamans and chanters, that I can't get behind the notion of returning the Affliction line to what it was--bugs need to be fixed, even after months and months. But you are right that this situation was handled miserably, and changes like this shouldn't just be allowed to tumble out of the sky on a regular basis at the expense of so many honest players.<p>Pretty nifty how I probably just alienated both sides of this debate, eh? Kind of begs the question...<p><BIG>How Did You Manage That?</BIG><p>Another Legacy of Ykesha feature recently announced is the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_guildtool.jsp">Guild Management Tool</a>. This dandy little window allows you to see where your guildmates are, whether or not they are online, and make notes about them.<p>Guild leaders and officers get to make public notes about members that will be visible to the entire guild, and gain easy access to commands--including the ability to remove members who aren't online (a long, long overdue feature). Keeping track of defunct members and mountains of alts will be much easier--in the public note space, for instance, you can specify whose alt a given toon is. This tool should eliminate a lot of the guild spying that goes on and will cut down on the need to reform guilds every so often.<p>The only potential downside I see is that guild members can no longer be anonymous to each other. Currently, someone can go /anon or /role and their fellow guildmembers won't have any idea where they are. The positive side of this is that members won't be able to duck out of raids or avoid detection; the negative side is that they sacrifice a bit of privacy during times when they might want to be left alone.<p>Some frazzled cleric, for example, might choose to play his rogue alt for fun some night, only to get a /tell from a guildmember who needs a cleric in an exp group and proceeds to lay a guilt trip on the cleric. Guilds may need to establish some guidelines about the use of the tool to prevent this kind of abuse. The other solution, of course, is to keep some alts unguilded. Or, maybe zone locations of /anon and /role players should only be visible to guild officers and leaders.<p>Despite the possible issues that may arise, this tool should prove to be one of the more valuable additions from the LoY expansion. Thumbs up on this puppy.<p><BIG>Money's Too Tight to Mention</BIG><p>EQ once again surfaces on a &quot;real&quot; news site, as a Slate article examines <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2078053/">economic trends</a> within the game. After a lot of talk from the writer (who obviously isn't a die-hard player by any means), conclusions like this are drawn:<p><B>This may provide the most important lesson of all from the EverQuest experiment: Real equality can obviate much of a democratic government's intervention in a modern economy.</B><p>Zzzzzzzzzzzz... hurmph, a, what? Oh, sorry.<p>I almost hate to link to this thing, lest you all go there and fall asleep like I did, thus failing to finish my sparklingly written article. I guess economics majors might find the piece compelling, but the rest of you should click with care. And have a pillow handy.<p><BIG>Rumors, Innuendoes, and Lies</BIG><p>Every once in a while, threads pop up on various message boards talking about rumors that used to circulate back in the early days of EQ--you know, before everything had been spoiled. The sea monster in Lake Rathe, Mistmoore being in game... all the things old-school players used to discuss in whispers around the campfire.<p>Most of the time you get people who say they were in beta 1 so they know such-and-such about so-and-so, but rarely do we get definitive answers from people who have clear credibility. A <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=27353.topic">recent thread</a> on the Safehouse, however, features a response from Kendrick, former Verant employee and rogue guru, that has some interesting info:<p><B>Anti camp radius was real, and disabled before release. First used in Najena. <p>A cyclops in EK did drop the ring. I know because I put it there. Didn't last long.<p>Mayong was never in the game as an NPC, though there might have been some GM events where he was simulated. There were plans to put him in the game, but in the end the Maestro of Rancor has the model that was going to be used for Mayong.<p>The sea (lake) monster in Lake Rathetear was real, the Megalodon. A huge shark model that had collision issues complicated by pathing issues.</B><p>The anti-camp thing was the idea that if you were too close to a mob's spawn point, the little bugger wouldn't pop, so you had to keep a certain distance. Imagine what the game would be like today if that had stayed in.<p>Threads like this are fun once in a while, especially when someone truly in the know makes a post. While some of this stuff was covered in an EQ newsletter sent out last year, it's still neat to revisit it every so often and hearken back to the days when the game was fresh and new.<p>I wonder how long EQ2's era of unknowns will last. Sadly, probably not as long as some of us would like.
