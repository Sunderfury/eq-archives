					<p>Friday I head down to Philadelphia to attend the <a title="My first rated X summit!" href="http://www.gamexpo.us/summit/" target="_blank">GameX Industry Summit</a>. I&#8217;ll be on a panel Saturday at 4pm titled &#8220;<a title="Longest. Title. Ever." href="http://www.gamexpo.us/summit/details.html#right_1024_1600" target="_blank">Beyond Raids and Ganks: Exploring Next-Gen MMOs   in a non WoW-Killer Context</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>What will I be talking about? How to build a WoW killer, of course!</p>
<p>Okay, not really. Here is the panel description:</p>
<blockquote><p>The MMO is here to stay! Having said that, there is an industry push to introduce new paradigms that take the genre beyond the status quo. In what ways can we create MMOs that innovate within the genre, create new player experiences, and develop deeper, more impacting stories, narrations, and character development? This panel brings together developers working on three new MMOs that are pushing boundaries and innovating beyond established concepts. The panelists will discuss the strengths of the MMO format and then break into how they view the MMO developing, through player experiences, new &#8220;success&#8221; metrics, hybridization of genres, targeted gameplay approaches and developments in story and character.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dang. Hopefully they invited me along to lighten things up with my razor-sharp wit.</p>
<p>Anyway, it should be a fun time and I look forward to meeting my fellow panelists. I won&#8217;t know many folks there, so if you happen to be attending please flag me down and say hello. I&#8217;m usually in a much better mood than I appear, so don&#8217;t be afraid!

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There has been a recent round of blog posts suggesting that current MMOs have <a title="Typical explorer" href="http://www.psychochild.org/?p=810" target="_blank">lost something</a>, that they <a title="Can't afford to squander what you're not prepared to pay" href="http://www.frogdice.com/muckbeast/game_design/the-squandered-potential-of-mmos.html" target="_blank">aren&#8217;t living up to their potential</a>, are in <a title="The revolution will be televised" href="http://tishtoshtesh.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/death-grip-on-the-reins/" target="_blank">desperate need of a revolution</a>, and that power-mad developers are trying to <a title="Use the Force, dude" href="http://tishtoshtesh.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/death-grip-on-the-reins/" target="_blank">lock players on a limited path</a>. Of course, these assertions aren&#8217;t anything new&#8211;posters on entrenched message boards like <a title="Abandon all hope, oh ye who enter" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/" target="_blank">FoH</a> have been saying the same thing for years.</p>
<p>Certainly there is room for entirely new styles of massively multiplayer online games to be developed. We <em>need </em>this kind of development to happen. But the fact is that the Diku MMO is here to stay, if for no other reason that it&#8217;s a popular style of game that millions of people around the world have proven willing to pay money for. So look, just stop whining that the genre is exhausted and out of ideas, because <em>it doesn&#8217;t matter</em>&#8211;even if there are jaded gamers who have had enough of the format and should <a title="Yes, I mean every single one of you" href="http://forums.f13.net/index.php?board=45.0" target="_blank">just move on already</a>, there are millions of new players waiting to take their places.</p>
<p>Rather than abandoning hope for the Diku MMO&#8211;which is about as likely to disappear from the gaming landscape as the FPS&#8211;we should look for ways to address its <a title="Ferrel always has an opinion" href="http://www.epicslant.com/2009/10/problem-with-quest-grind/" target="_blank">shortcomings</a>.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t that there are a lot of quests in these games; it&#8217;s that the quests are often boring, non-heroic, and the only legitimate path of advancement. Worse still, quests in some current titles actually penalize socialization because updates don&#8217;t apply to the whole group. And nobody enjoys ganking a named creature in the wild only to reach a quest hub and receive a mission to kill that very same beastie.</p>
<p>These are solvable problems. Let&#8217;s not do away with the game content Achievers love; let&#8217;s stop penalizing Explorers and Socializers instead. By being thoughtful about our methods of delivering achievement, we should actually feed exploration and socialization. Reward people for encountering mysteries in the wild. Create settings that foster a variety of adventuring outside the linear quest line.</p>
<p>Another topic that comes up a lot is how current MMOs have removed all sense of danger and risk. Again, this is a problem we can solve without going in a completely ridiculous and reckless direction. Simply walking outside the borders of your home town needn&#8217;t mean that everything your character has ever earned is on the line (don&#8217;t worry&#8211;those of you who enjoy that sort of thing will always have niche PvP games to play for however many months of lifespan those titles have). Punitive death penalties may please the hardcore, but they are one of the primary reasons players leave a game.</p>
<p>Instead, find other stakes with real consequences that players can fight for. Make them overcome huge obstacles with a real chance of loss&#8211;but loss that makes them feel like they really tried and want to do better next time, not a loss that makes them feel stupid or unskilled.</p>
<p>Look, a lot of this comes down to content, and making content is expensive&#8211;believe me, I know. But MMO makers are just going to have to bite the bullet on this one. If you read between the lines and pay attention to what the developers of tomorrow&#8217;s MMOs are telling you, several companies are working on addressing these challenges in their own ways (such as BioWare, Trion, and, yes, 38 Studios). There is no universal solution, but developers are trying new things.</p>
<p>While some teams will focus on taking the MMO into bold new directions, others will try to build upon what has proven to work and make it even better. This genre has room for both revolution and evolution, and in fact needs both paths to thrive. Pushing boundaries is healthy, but throwing out the baby with the bathwater would ultimately undermine the considerable progress MMOs have made since the late 1990s.

					<p><a title="Elephants have big poop" href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2009/10/story-of-elephant-sculpture.html" target="_blank">Tobold</a> and <a title="Really big poop" href="http://syncaine.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/your-mmo-wont-have-a-million-subs-sorry-blizzard/" target="_blank">Syncaine</a> are having a debate as to whether the great unannounced MMO from Blizzard will reach a million subs. Both make some interesting points, but of course neither will be proven correct for a long time.</p>
<p>I think both arguments are missing a key element, though.</p>
<p>Especially for those of us who have been playing MMOs for ten years now, we tend to think of the audience as being fairly static. As with most forms of entertainment, it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If the success of the second <em>Star Wars</em> movie trilogy had been predicated on the response to those of us who grew up with the original three films, the newer movies would have been failures or modest successes (after all, many original fans were disappointed in them). On the contrary, the films were huge hits. Why? Because there was a whole new audience that embraced them&#8211;yes, even Jar Jar.</p>
<p>My friend and colleague Bob Salvatore has written a lot of books about dark elves. If his sales were confined to the same people buying every single one of them, he wouldn&#8217;t keep ending up on the New York Times best-seller list. He does. Why? Because new generations of readers are buying his books. While he also retains many readers, his audience is constantly renewed.</p>
<p>Blizzard&#8217;s next MMO project will be a huge success. Why? Because (unless something completely uncharacteristic happens) they will release a very polished game that is a lot of fun to play. Will the 11 million players of WoW buy it? It won&#8217;t matter&#8211;there will be a whole new generation of MMO players who will. Whether it&#8217;s future gamers who are kids now but won&#8217;t be in a few years, or those who feel WoW is too old and entrenched to be appealing, or those who just don&#8217;t care for the Warcraft franchise&#8211; there are a ton of people who will be ready to try something fresh and new.</p>
<p>This is the same reason why the fantasy Diku MMO still works. Jaded gamers on message boards may tire of them, but the genre&#8217;s proven appeal will continue to resonate with new gamers coming into the space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fashionable to complain about Hollywood or the games industry revisiting the same ideas time and again. But the truth is, there are new audience members entering the marketplace of ideas all the time, and what is well-tread ground to you is an open road to them.

					<p>The post on my site that gets the most spam is titled &#8220;<a title="hotness" href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=126" target="_blank">Minnesota MMO Blog Explosion!</a>&#8221; so I figured I&#8217;d make another post with a spammer-friendly title and give the bots a new target.</p>
<p>Anyway, I spent part of my weekend on a panel at the inaugural <a title="Arguably one of the worst designed websites you'll ever see" href="http://www.gameunicon.com/" target="_blank">GameUnicon</a> here in Massachusetts. I was joined by my cohort <a href="http://www.nerfbat.com/">Shwayder</a> and <a title="No, not the BBC chap, although he is British" href="http://elvishparsley.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Justin Webb</a> from <a title="The OTHER MMO developer in Maynard" href="http://www.tencentboston.com/" target="_blank">Tencent Boston</a>. We had an excellent discussion with the seven people in the audience (only one of which was a spouse!).</p>
<p>As proof of our awesomeness at the event, here is a video that Justin and Angela put together.</p>

					<p>On one side of a room, imagine a realistic drawing of a mushroom. On the other side of the room, imagine a realistic drawing of a human penis. Now imagine a line connecting them which is made up of similar drawings, each becoming gradually more stylized.  Somewhere along that line, the mushroom will become indistinguishable from the penis.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced that there are some game artists for whom the ultimate quest is finding that point. I can&#8217;t explain why. But somebody needs to come up with a name for this phenomenon.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>My friend and colleague Jason Roberts (Dymus) is generally a man of few words, so when he says something, it&#8217;s worth your time to listen. He recently made <a title="It's just about the only thing worthwhile in the whole thread" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/24711-green-monster-games-curt-schilling-475.html#post1467589" target="_blank">a post in the 38 thread on FoH</a> which merits further attention, so I am quoting it here. His post was in response to the notion that &#8220;the Next Generation of MMOs is coming&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m quite literal and thus a generation is defined by an iteration and building upon the best of what came before. Since MMO&#8217;s take roughly 5-6 years from inception to completion let&#8217;s use that with the overlap. Given that, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re in the midst of generation 2 and working on generation 3. I&#8217;m also keeping the focus to subscription and &#8216;classic&#8217; style MMO&#8217;s, adding the other branches gets unmanageable and I want to stick to one family tree.</p>
<p>Generation 0:  IRC, play by e-mail, web games, MUD&#8217;s (This is obvious)</p>
<p>Generation 1: (1999-2004) Asheron&#8217;s Call, EverQuest, Ultima Online, Meridian 59, Dark Age of Camelot, Anarchy Online, and others.</p>
<p>Generation 2: (2003-2008) World of Warcraft, EVE Online, EverQuest II, Warhammer, Conan, Star Wars Galaxies, Final Fantasy, Matrix Online, City of Heroes, Vanguard, and several others.</p>
<p>Generation 3: (2009-2014) Whatever Blizzard is making, Star Wars: Old Republic, Whatever Carbine is making, Heroes of Telara, whatever else Trion is making, Copernicus, and others.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s play evolution&#8230;<br />
<strong>Generation 1</strong>: There were three main models that passed on their genes &#8212; Ultima Online, EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot. There were traits that the second generation inherited from all the other games but the primary evolutions in generation 2 came from those three.</p>
<p>What did generation 1 teach us? MMO&#8217;s work. Playing with other people is fun. Raiding is cool. Organized PvP is cool. Emergent gameplay is not always a bad thing. Among a whole host of other things, but it was all new.</p>
<p><strong>Generation 2</strong>: What defines generation 2 is a refinement of the main ideas from the prior generation. In this, one game had one very key adaptation: Accessibility. Other evolutions happened they just were not as successful.</p>
<p>But what has Generation 2 taught us? People like to play &#8216;around&#8217; others but not necessarily always &#8216;with&#8217; others. Accessibility and polish are of critical importance when there are choices. Focus on what your game IS not what it COULD be. (A corollary is that radically changing a game mid-flight is probably a bad idea). Building massive worlds and system generated content to fill them is bad.</p>
<p><strong>Generation 3</strong>: We&#8217;re just starting here. But there are now two generations to learn from. Not all the ideas from generation 1 were refined in generation 2 since they were so overshadowed by the one big adaptation of Accessibility and polish. I think those are a given by now, if you don&#8217;t have that adaptation you can&#8217;t compete in the natural selection. The question is, will Generation 3 hit on anything like that adaptation and be a clear trait to carry forward? Perhaps&#8230; a lot of us are guessing what it could be, and it might be that there is more than a single answer.</p>
<p>What do I think generation 3 teach us? Story (personal and world focused) is more important than people guessed. You can successfully apply the working models to more genres than fantasy. You can make a massively single player game and still be successful. If you don&#8217;t seriously include socialization as a goal you&#8217;ll have a serious retention problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people are still quick to throw the tired phrase &#8220;next gen&#8221; around. When I was community manager on EQ2, I had to constantly hear a certain game being touted as &#8220;third gen&#8221; without any substantive merit as to what that meant, so I really like Jason&#8217;s delineation. It&#8217;s not about technology or platform, but about key adaptations and innovations. After all, building Pong with fancy 3D assets doesn&#8217;t make it a next-gen game. Truly ushering in a new generation is about building upon what went before and adding both polish and some interesting new twists.

					<p>As <a title="I hear they have good steaks down there" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24485" target="_blank">reported by Gamasutra</a>, my old nemesis Owlchick and I will be doing a <a title="It was her idea" href="https://www.cmpevents.com/GDAU09/a.asp?option=C&amp;V=11&amp;SessID=9722" target="_blank">presentation at GDC Austin</a> with the antagonistic title &#8220;Writing for MMOs: You&#8217;re Doing It Wrong.&#8221; Doing the panel was Tracy&#8217;s idea; the title was mine.</p>
<p>I have no idea how we suckered the GDC folks into accepting our proposal. No doubt they&#8217;ll live to regret it. Hopefully we think of a few interesting things to say in addition to rehashing the drivel from our contribution to <a title="I wonder why I haven't gotten a royalty check yet" href="http://www.akpeters.com/product.asp?ProdCode=4179" target="_blank">that book with the horrible cover</a>.</p>
<p>It will be my first trip to Austin and my first presentation at a GDC. <a title="Yeah, I mean you, Hartsman" href="http://www.hartsman.com/" target="_blank">Somebody</a> better buy me one hell of a steak for all this trouble.

<p>tml;dc (too many links, didn&#8217;t click) &#8211; Furor pretty much posted that Vanguard was going to kick ass. I quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This game was fleshed out and built from the ground UP. These guys put so much work into getting the game built that it would be impossible to put everything in this update; and also illegal. Thousands and thousands of pages of gameplay design and documentation &#8211; I’m talking massive BOOKS, full of lore, maps, class descriptions, races, monsters, everything. You won’t see any MOONS popping up out of nowhere in this game. Expansions, additions, extensions, all thoughtfully planned out&#8230;. The folks at Sigil already have a quality product on their hands and I cannot wait until they release some information to the public so all of you can have the pleasure of getting a glimpse of what I got to see during my visit.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of those who tried Vanguard would suggest that the aforementioned quality was noticeably lacking in the final product. So what&#8217;s up? Was Furor lying, or at the very least stretching the truth so that he could stay in the good graces of some old friends?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. I think what happened on his visit was that Furor was presented with stories and visions, plans and ideas. And they sounded good. They had heart behind them. When coupled with some fancy artwork and a workable tech demo, Furor drank the Kool-Aid: he bought into the notion of <em>What Could Be</em>. Needless to say, he wasn&#8217;t alone&#8211;the Sigil forums were dominated for years by those who believed that Vanguard would be The One Game which would rule all others, and were willing to poke anyone who disagreed in the virtual eyeball.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy for fans to hear a passionate developer talk about ideas and begin to believe that they will be brought to life just as described. It can even happen to the very people working on a game! Developers can get so caught up in the game playing in their heads that they lose sight of the reality of the game that actually exists on their hard drives.</p>
<p>What is the ultimate root of this mass delusion? The simple fact that <strong>ideas are cheap</strong>. Even great ones.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a great idea for an MMO. So what? It means nothing unless you can pull it off. That means you must have both the skills necessary to implement it (writing, scripting, populating, coding, modeling, etc.) and the means to put it in game (stable, usable tools). If either your skills or your ability to implement falls short, your great idea will die a death of futility. The Graveyard of Ideas is full of great ones that simply couldn&#8217;t be pulled off.</p>
<p>Once again, it comes down to a simple truism: It&#8217;s all about execution. Do you have the skills to do it? Do you have the means to make it happen? And, if the answer to both those things is yes, do you possess the determination to polish your work to immaculate perfection as well as the strength of will to scrap it entirely if it doesn&#8217;t serve the fundamental pillars of your game?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to pick on poor Vanguard. Any number of failed games (MMOs and non-MMOs alike) could have been used to illustrate my point. Books, movies, music, TV shows&#8230; the same thing happens in every medium. Millions of dollars get thrown around every day on the strength of what someone believes to be a great idea. It&#8217;s not the idea that&#8217;s the gamble; it&#8217;s the ability for the investee to be able to execute it as well as they can talk about it.</p>
<p>By doing a bit of extrapolation, you begin to see why making a great MMO is so damn hard. You can make a successful console game if you execute one truly great idea extremely well. To make a great MMO, you need dozens of interconnected systems all based on great ideas executed extremely well, supported by thousands of iterations of quests, items, appearances, and locations executed to the highest degree of polish and care. All it takes is one major flaw to bring down all your great ideas like a house of cards. On top of that, if you have mediocre people implementing great ideas, those great ideas will end up looking mediocre.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like you can&#8217;t win! Maybe all of us in this business are gluttons for punishment. Or perhaps, for some of us, the possibility of pulling it off is too intoxicating to resist.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not (always) idiocy or incompetence that makes high-profile MMOs fail. It&#8217;s more that a whole bunch of interconnected things all need to go exceptionally right for one of  these games to come together. More often than not, it&#8217;s a few specific weaknesses in crucial areas that cause certain games to be considered a disappointment in the eyes of players.

					<p><a title="Live is not sexy" href="http://www.eldergame.com/2009/07/08/the-warcraft-live-teams-b-squad/" target="_blank">Check out a great post</a> by Eric at Elder Game talking about the cycle a live game goes through as it matures and a new generation of developers comes aboard.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very true that a lot of game developers enjoy shipping a title and then moving on to the next. In the console world this is how it&#8217;s done, of course; the MMO universe operates as a live service after launch, which is something even many seasoned developers are not used to or interested in. So having people move on is an expected part of the process.</p>
<p>The first year after EQ2 launched saw a number of its senior people leave, either for new opportunities within SOE or to other companies. But since the game remained SOE&#8217;s flagship product for some time, the team still had ample resources and plenty of good people on board. And as <a title="because he posts about *everything*" href="http://brokentoys.org/2009/07/10/scott-hartsman-leaves-scott-hartsman/" target="_blank">Lum mentions</a>, <a title="one of the best" href="http://www.hartsman.com/" target="_blank">my friend Scott</a> proved an invaluable presence who led the team to make many popular changes to the game. (Oh, what might have been if only so many of the game&#8217;s formative years of development hadn&#8217;t been squandered&#8230; but what&#8217;s done is done.)</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who&#8217;s done a fair bit of it, fixing other people&#8217;s broken shit is not always fun. I&#8217;m not referring to the kind of stuff where a design decision was made one way and you&#8217;d rather take it another; I mean coming across something horribly broken and convoluted<strong> </strong>that unfortunately crept into the game because at some point quantity was more of a priority than quality. But you do learn an awful lot from the experience, some of which is applicable to starting a new project from the ground up and some of which is not.</p>
<p>New projects are inherently sexy and fun. It&#8217;s a chance to make all new kinds of mistakes instead (you hope!) of repeating old ones. But by the same token, I agree with Eric that there is a lot to be said for working on a live game&#8211;especially if it&#8217;s one you love and want to see get better. But as he notes, a new generation of developers can sometimes be overwhelmed by good intentions and leap to make changes before fully understanding the implications. Hopefully the transition between the &#8220;A&#8221; squad and the &#8220;B&#8221; team is gradual enough that an osmosis of wisdom can occur and leave the new caretakers with everything they need to do the job well.
