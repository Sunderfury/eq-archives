			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in California for the first time in years to attend E3. I haven&#8217;t been to the show since the height of its excess, before it was neutered. Though still manic and bombastic, it feels noticeably less chaotic to me. I have memories (now fond, at the time not so much) of being hoarse each night after trying to shout my demo script for visitors at the SOE booth because I was competing with blaring sound systems from other booths. While communication still requires some effort on the show floor, it seems considerably easier than I remember it.</p>
<p>The show will never again inspire the awe and wonder I experienced the first time I attended, but it&#8217;s cool nonetheless. Activision&#8217;s reveal of the MW3 trailer was a dramatic event that had the crowd breathless in anticipation. Sony and Nintendo hardware had a ton of folks checking it out. Smaller projects drew attention as well&#8211;World of Tanks had an actual tank on display.</p>
<p>The show had its share of underwhelming displays as well, but that&#8217;s to be expected. Overall E3 remains a genuine event, a chance for the games industry to show off a bit in the shadow of Hollywood.</p>
<p>The coolest bit for me was checking out the Reckoning booth and seeing our team demo the RPG. I&#8217;m really excited about players getting to learn more about our world. And seeing the latest trailer playing on EA&#8217;s gigantic booth screen gave me chills.</p>
<p>Guess I&#8217;m just a sucker for the pageantry of it all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s very easy for game designers to come up with lofty, complex ideas. This is especially true for people who take a support role on one project and suddenly find themselves in charge of something on another title; they get the impulse to put their stamp on everything, to show the world how clever they are by embroiling players in complex plots and multi-layered gameplay.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best thing you can do is take a step back and simplify things.</p>
<p>Every night at dinner, I get asked by my toddler, &#8220;Daddy, what did you do at work today?&#8221; My answers vary, but often I mention how I looked at pictures of monsters (character art review), saw some fantastic place (environment art review), read a story about some great battle (narrative review), and so forth. Occasionally I even get to talk about something I wrote myself! If I say I looked at a monster, I&#8217;m asked &#8220;Was he good or bad?&#8221; If I say bad, I&#8217;m asked &#8220;What does he want to get?&#8221; And I usually give a little story about that creature&#8217;s motivations.</p>
<p>After this ritual had been going on a while, it suddenly struck me how incredibly useful this was to me as a storyteller and designer. If I can&#8217;t boil the plots and motivations of our characters down into simple terms that a child can understand, we&#8217;ve probably over-designed the experience&#8211;which means grown-up players won&#8217;t get it, either.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say stories and gameplay have to be written like an episode of Dora the Explorer. The nuances and depth should be there for those who want to delve into them. But at the base level, the primary motivations of your characters and storylines need to be clear and obvious. Otherwise, all the fancy dialogue and pretty graphics won&#8217;t matter, because the drama of your game won&#8217;t resonate with the audience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the whole, 2010 was a fantastic year for new music. A lot of my favorite bands released albums, and a whole crop of new artists showed up with awesome material.</p>
<p>It was a struggle for me to name a single Album of the Year; for the first time since I&#8217;ve been doing this feature, any entry in the &#8220;Gotta Have It&#8221; category could easily have earned the distinction. So please, consider every album in that group a required purchase.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s list comes with a brand new feature: an iTunes playlist showcasing some of my favorite tracks of the year. In addition to picking standout tracks, I tried to create a nice flow from one to another. Let me know what you think.</p>
<p><span id="more-630"></span>&gt;&gt; <strong>Like It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ryan Adams &amp; The Cardinals &#8211; <em>III/IV</em> </strong>- While its not unusual for an artist to have some leftover tracks after the completion of an album of new material, it isn&#8217;t common for there to be two discs worth&#8211;unless the artist in question is Ryan Adams. Fans know how ridiculously prolific he can be, and also know that just because these tracks are &#8220;leftovers&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean they are lacking in quality. In fact, the songs in this double set stand up very well alongside <em>Easy Tiger</em>, the previous album Adams released with The Cardinals.</p>
<p><strong>Local Natives &#8211; <em>Gorilla Manor</em></strong> &#8211; We didn&#8217;t get a new album from Fleet Foxes this year, but Local Natives delivered a record with harmonies nearly as skillful and appealing. This band is no cheap knock-off, though; their song structures and instrumentation have a distinct feel that ventures more into the quirky than the Foxes ever do.</p>
<p><strong>Sleigh Bells &#8211; <em>Treats</em></strong><em> </em>- Combine distorted beats, arena rock guitar, and lilting female vocals that alternate between a hip-hop cadence and alternapop catchiness and you get close to describing the sound of Sleigh Bells. This over-amplified aural odyssey induces an almost trance-like state when you crank it up, and you fall more deeply under its spell after repeated listens.</p>
<p><strong>Band of Horses &#8211; <em>Infinite Arms</em></strong> &#8211; I can&#8217;t exactly lay my finger on why this album didn&#8217;t resonate with me as much as their first two efforts. Perhaps some of the slower songs just sounded, apart from the distinctive vocals, like rote power ballads. Still worth a listen, but I can&#8217;t recommend this disc as highly as I would have liked.</p>
<p><strong>Kanye West</strong><strong> &#8211; <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em></strong> &#8211;  Musically, I agree with the many critics who praise this album as a  work of genius. Lyrically, it&#8217;s a very mixed bag for me. While there are  moments of genuine introspection and insight, they are undermined by  needless posing and misogynous lyrics. I admire a lot about this record,  but I can&#8217;t get myself to love it.</p>
<p><strong>Crowded House &#8211; <em>Intriguer</em></strong><em> </em>- Crowded House will always be one of my favorite bands, and <em>Temple of Low Men</em> still stands as one of my desert island albums. There are songs on <em>Intriguer</em> which stand well alongside their earlier work, but I was left a bit cold by some of the more run-of-the-mill numbers. Nevertheless, if you have an opportunity to see the band live, please take it&#8211;you&#8217;ll not regret a moment of the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Interpol &#8211; <em>Interpol</em></strong><em> </em>- This band stands out from the crowd of similar goth-tinged rock bands by showcasing a quirky side. Just when you think you know where one of their songs is going, it suddenly jerks in another direction. It works better on some tracks than others, and I&#8217;m not sure how long they can keep using the same bag of tricks, but the songs on this eponymous release are catchy and interesting enough to overcome the concern that the band may be going to the well a bit too often.</p>
<p><strong>Philip Selway &#8211; <em>Familial</em></strong><em> </em>- Unless you&#8217;re a  die-hard Radiohead fan, you&#8217;re unlikely to know that Mr. Selway is the  band&#8217;s drummer. That&#8217;s okay; it took a sticker on the album cover  reminding me of such to get me to make this purchase. And I&#8217;m glad I  did&#8211;though its singer/songwriter vibe is a complete departure from the  sound of modern Radiohead, the songs here are potent and enjoyable. The  disc starts off strong and wanders a bit, but it&#8217;s a fantastic first  effort from an artist I hope we get to hear a lot more from.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Love It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Sylvian &#8211; <em>Sleepwalkers</em></strong><em> </em>- This collection of collaborative tracks isn&#8217;t a new album per se, but it combines new material with remixes and some fairly obscure tracks that had been scattered about various projects over the past decade. It makes a pretty good overview of Sylvian&#8217;s recent work, which is to say it touches a wide variety of genres. His solo albums, such as last year&#8217;s <em>Manafon</em>, tend to be very focused on a single sound, while this compilation allowed for a much wider latitude of styles.</p>
<p><strong>Daft Punk &#8211; <em>TRON Legacy Soundtrack</em></strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m not a huge fan of listening to movie scores without their visual context, but this effort by the always interesting Daft Punk is deeply satisfying on its own. They really captured the feel of the film while creating a work that stands up without it. A really great transmedia experience.</p>
<p><strong>The National &#8211; <em>High Violet</em></strong> &#8211; If Interpol and Editors wouldn&#8217;t exist without Joy Division, then the National wouldn&#8217;t exist without the Tindersticks. This band has a brooding, introspective vibe that could easily fall into self indulgence, but their music and lyrics possess enough grace and optimism to ultimately be uplifting. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that they can write a catchy song, either.</p>
<p><strong>Black Keys &#8211; <em>Brothers </em></strong>- This band effortlessly blends influences like pop, blues, and Zeppelin into an irresistibly catchy cocktail of awesomeness. The production work of Danger Mouse brings an extra level of ramshackle polish to the whole affair. If you&#8217;re throwing a party, you need to play this record. Loudly.</p>
<p><strong>Sting &#8211; <em>Symphonicity </em>&amp; <em>Live in Berlin</em></strong> &#8211; Following a lengthy tour by the Police, I was surprised to see Sting release yet another retreading of old material rather than a new album. Yet the results are largely pleasing; Sting&#8217;s songs are well-suited for reinterpretation by an orchestra, and the real treats on both the studio and live discs are the various non-album  tracks sprinkled throughout (such as &#8220;The Pirate&#8217;s Bride,&#8221; an old b-side I co-opted as the basis for a quest in EQ2).</p>
<p><strong>Danger Mouse &amp; Sparklehorse &#8211; <em>Dark Night of the Soul</em></strong> &#8211; Danger Mouse makes yet another appearance on my list as one of the principles of the <em>Dark Night of the Soul</em>. The album features a varied lot of vocalists and contributors, including Suzanne Vega, Iggy Pop, Frank Black, and David Lynch. Darkness pervades the disc, and not in name only; the spectre of death hovers over this project, plagued by the deaths of Mark Linkous (Sparklehorse) and Vic Chesnutt. The latter&#8217;s &#8220;Grim Augury&#8221; is  one of the most unsettling performances I&#8217;ve heard in years.</p>
<p><strong>Broken Bells &#8211; <em>Broken Bells</em></strong> &#8211; When I first heard that James Mercer of the Shins was working on a project with Danger Mouse, I was almost frightened by the potential for greatness. The album did not disappoint. Catchy, provocative, and expertly crafted, this album delivers in spades. If you like the Shins, this one is a no-brainer.</p>
<p><strong>Blonde Redhead &#8211; <em>Penny Sparkle</em></strong> &#8211; If asked to describe Blonde Redhead&#8217;s music, I&#8217;d be somewhat at a loss. Take the cool parts of the Sugarcubes and discard their silliness, combine with the soundscapes of the Cocteau Twins, add in a bit of the Cure&#8217;s melancholy, and you have something approaching this band&#8217;s sound&#8211;though I&#8217;ve still done a poor job explaining how it all meshes together. Blonde Redhead has consistently put out some of my favorite albums of the past decade, and though I think <em>Penny Sparkle</em> gets a bit off track midway through, it is nonetheless a wonderful album by a remarkable band.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Gabriel &#8211; <em>Scratch My Back</em></strong> &#8211; It takes years for Gabriel to deliver a new album, so when I heard that his next project was going to be a selection of cover songs, I was more than a bit irritated. Yet much to my surprise, the songs here are every bit as satisfying as his original material. The limitations imposed by Gabriel upon this work&#8211;classical instruments and no drums&#8211;result in a tight yet varied collection. My favorite is the startling reinterpretation of &#8220;Boy in the Bubble,&#8221; which takes the Paul Simon original into an entirely new realm. A fantastic album.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Jones &#8211; <em>Praise &amp; Blame</em> </strong>- Rising to worldwide fame as a 60s crooner, Jones has been best known in the last couple decades for clever covers and campy pop that has been more popular in Europe than in the States. But it would be a huge mistake to dismiss his talent; <em>Praise &amp; Blame</em> is a collection of bare-bones anthems rooted in blues and gospel touching on themes of love, lust, redemption, and damnation. Jones is 70 years old, but the power of his trademark voice has barely diminished&#8211;he puts vocalists a third his age to shame. This may well be a career-best album for this too-overlooked star.</p>
<p><strong>Sun Kil Moon &#8211; <em>Admiral Fell Promises</em></strong> -  I have waited many years for Mark Kozelek to release an album worthy of the potential of Red House Painters&#8217; debut EP, <em>Down Colorful Hill</em>.  Though I&#8217;ve consistently loved Kozelek&#8217;s work across his various  incarnations, I&#8217;ve found them to be inconsistent or slightly flawed.  Finally, this record delivers everything I could hope for, and more. A  heartbreaking, beautiful album that fulfills all promises. It was worth  the wait.</p>
<p><strong>Editors &#8211; <em>In This Light and On This Evening</em></strong> &#8211; There is no question that Editors live in the house that Joy Division built. Though they&#8217;ve had really strong albums before, this latest effort marks a new creative pinnacle for the band. There isn&#8217;t a wasted track to be found here, and the driving, danceable goth/pop anthems really shine. With a style of music well suited to a smokey club, its time that Editors stepped out into the spotlight.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Gotta Have It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gil Scott-Heron &#8211; <em>I&#8217;m New Here</em></strong> &#8211; Gil Scott-Heron is often filed under jazz, but his work combines spoken word with jazz, hip-hop, blues, and even Leonard Cohen-esque folk. The first time I heard <em>I&#8217;m New Here</em>, I was literally left speechless by its openness and raw emotion. Rarely does an artist lay his life so bare for all to see as is the case here; Scott-Heron talks about his life being raised in a &#8220;broken home,&#8221; and redefines the phrase in the most heart-wrenching and heartwarming way. This is a stunning work of art, with a directness and intimacy that&#8217;s truly moving. A masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey Thorn &#8211; <em>Love and Its Opposite</em></strong> &#8211; Best known as the  vocalist for Everything But the Girl, Thorn has explored styles ranging  from folksy pop to sparse electronica. She puts the whole bag of tricks  into her latest effort, with spectacular results. Tracey has never  sounded better, both in vocal quality and the wit and wisdom she brings  to the work. This album is the work of an experienced artists at the top of her game.</p>
<p><strong>Janelle Monae &#8211; <em>The ArchAndroid</em></strong> &#8211; This album has everything. Literally, everything&#8211;it features just about every style of music you can name, from classical to rap to 60s girl band to hip hop to&#8230; well, you get the idea. It&#8217;s in here, along with a concept storyline that pulls together robots and love songs and&#8230; uh, lots of other stuff. If you haven&#8217;t heard of this album, it&#8217;s probably because traditional record labels have no idea how to market such a schizophrenic work of genius. I&#8217;m probably not helping the case by trying to describe it, so let me boil it down for you: Janelle Monae is fantastic in every possible way, and this masterfully crafted album exists on a plane all its own. Buy it. Buy it now.</p>
<p><strong>Tricky &#8211; <em>Mixed Race</em></strong> &#8211; The best of Tricky&#8217;s solo work drips with a sinister sexuality that makes you feel slightly voyeuristic for listening to it, as if you&#8217;re peering into some darkened room where naughty things are happening. That dirty intimacy works masterfully on <em>Mixed Race</em>, winding snake-like rhythms together with pulsingly memorable riffs. This is an album that shamelessly envelops you, and you&#8217;re all too pleased to let it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Massive Attack &#8211; <em>Heligoland </em></strong>- There aren&#8217;t many bands you can cite as being the artist who brought an entire genre of music into the mainstream, but that&#8217;s exactly what Massive Attack did with trip hop. It has been ages since Tricky&#8217;s former colleagues released an album of new material, and the band&#8217;s had a turbulent history over the years. But none of that matters when you listen to <em>Heligoland</em>, a collection of fantastic songs that lure you into their dreamy soundscape. Once again you&#8217;ll hear breathy vocals by a smattering of contributors, but you almost don&#8217;t notice the disparate collection of singers because the tracks are so cohesive. This album completely reaffirms Massive Attack&#8217;s status as the masters of trip hop.</p>
<p><strong>Arcade Fire &#8211; <em>The Suburbs</em></strong> &#8211; Let me put it simply: With <em>The Suburbs</em>, Arcade Fire has delivered the ultimate indie rock record. I don&#8217;t know what more there is to say, and I have to wonder how the band will possibly top it. The songs here are so well crafted, and the production so finely sculpted while keeping its raw edge, that everything just works. I normally wouldn&#8217;t go so far out on a limb without living with the record for a few years, but I honestly think <em>The Suburbs</em> will be looked back upon as one of the classic albums of this genre, standing alongside discs like <em>Doolittle, Nevermind, Slanted &amp; Enchanted</em>, <em>Reckoning, </em>and many other alternative rock masterpieces. Time will tell, but I think it&#8217;s a pretty safe bet. My album of the year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <em>Cataclysm </em>trailer and news of the 4.0 patch lured me into resubscribing to WoW a couple days ago. After two lunch hours re-familiarizing myself with the game, I was actually enjoying myself and digging the interface improvements.</p>
<p>This morning, I received an email saying my Battle.net account password had been changed. After resetting the password and logging in, my characters were naked. A petition to a GM followed, and this evening I got mail that my items had been restored&#8211;though my account was now locked.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added the iPhone authenticator to my account, and I probably have to wait until next week for my account to be unfrozen. So it goes.</p>
<p>Without the ability to log into WoW tonight as planned, I had time to ponder the lousy life of the account hacker. I tried to picture the poor sap who logged into my characters, only to find them wearing crap gear with very little gold to their names. I mean, I only have one level 80, and he&#8217;s got mediocre instance gear&#8211;maybe a piece or two of heroic anything. My next highest is a level 70 with raid gear from <em>Burning Crusade</em>. How demoralizing it must be working in a basement somewhere, having to strip characters like this of their pitiful equipment.</p>
<p>There is room in my heart for sympathy. So long as I get my account back soon, that is.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a title="The scandal! The infamy!" href="http://ealouse.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/hello-world/" target="_blank">EA Louse blog</a> is all the rage these days, and I&#8217;m sure anyone who visits this site will have encountered many observations on its content already. I can neither confirm nor deny the author&#8217;s assertions, though of course over the years I&#8217;ve heard my share of stories about the dark secrets of various game projects. It&#8217;s a small industry, after all.</p>
<p>This phenomenon&#8211;disgruntled employees <a title="More scandal!" href="http://icefrogtruth.blogspot.com/2010/10/truth.html" target="_blank">venting anonymously</a> for all the world to see&#8211;is hardly new or unique. Any time an MMO or its developer hasn&#8217;t lived up to expectations, someone on the inside has leaked &#8220;the real story.&#8221; You can easily find similar posts by former employees of SOE, Sigil, Cryptic, Origin, and many other dev houses. And of course the fans and watchers of the industry pounce upon these posts and eagerly debate their merits, often with a hearty dose of &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing is, while there&#8217;s a certain amount of irresistible <em>schadenfreude</em> to be gleaned from these tales, one must keep in mind that they&#8217;re often written from a finite perspective. The average employee at a game development house is usually no more privy to the reasons behind the high-level decisions being made than employees in any other industry. There is no shortage of rumors and speculation&#8211;some more rooted in facts than others&#8211;but often enough bits of truth make their way into the mix to seem plausible and even likely.</p>
<p>Assuming that EA Louse believes everything he wrote to be the truth (which is a mighty big assumption to make, but let&#8217;s do so for the sake of argument), that does not mean that everything he wrote is <em>factual</em>. Another person on the same team may agree with some points and disagree with others; that doesn&#8217;t mean this person would be a lair, it just means that their experience and knowledge led them to a different perspective on what the truth is.</p>
<p>Again, I write this post neither to agree nor disagree with EA Louse&#8217;s post. Rather, I write to point out that everyone who posts on the Internet&#8211;me, you, EA Louse, <a title="A rebuttal from Kratos himself" href="http://criminalcrackdown.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-response-to-ea-louse.html" target="_blank">David Jaffe</a>, Perez Hilton, and any other goofball with a blog&#8211;does so from a certain perspective and with some kind of motivation or agenda. We mustn&#8217;t take for granted that truth is an absolute, even if it fills us with delight to believe so (there&#8217;s that old <em>schadenfreude</em> thing again). This is why honest post mortems are so difficult to come by; many of those involved are busy either covering their asses or looking to blame others for mistakes they themselves could have helped to avoid had they put the same degree of passion into fixing problems that they did complaining about them.</p>
<p>No doubt many other perspectives will be forthcoming in the days ahead (some have already been expressed in the copious comments section of the EA Louse blog), but no matter what is said, the objective facts of the situation will probably never be known to the public. Nor should they; even in our gossip-drenched culture, I hope we can collectively realize that it isn&#8217;t our right to know the details of what goes on behind a company&#8217;s closed doors any more than we&#8217;re entitled to know what Brad and Angelina ate for breakfast this morning. The Internet has done funny things to our perspective, to be sure.</p>
<p>That said&#8230; yeah, I got a kick out of reading it, too. I&#8217;m only human, after all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have not given up on blogging, despite all appearances to the contrary. It&#8217;s just that, well, I&#8217;ve been busy.</p>
<p>Lots of great stuff going on at work. As you may have heard, we announced our <a title="There shall be a... oh, you know" href="http://reckoningthegame.com/" target="_blank">first product</a> and have been talking about it at various shows. I know many of you are anxious for more news on the MMO, but our promotional efforts are focused on the RPG right now. All good things to those who wait.</p>
<p>If it counts for anything, I have started (or thought about starting) several articles over the past few months, but never finished writing them for one reason or another. So for your own amusement, please pretend that you read timely, thought-provoking, and highly entertaining posts on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are used video game sales a blight upon the industry?</li>
<li>The subscription MMO isn&#8217;t going anywhere</li>
<li>&#8220;Truth, Lies, and Frogloks: A Cautionary Tale&#8221;</li>
<li>Please buy me an iPad</li>
</ul>
<p>That last one isn&#8217;t really an article; I&#8217;d just love for someone to buy me an iPad.</p>
<p>But honestly, you should really be grateful that you&#8217;re getting a break from my ramblings. You&#8217;ll probably be sick of me again soon enough.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I&#8217;ll be <a title="Damn, I am sexy" href="https://www.cmpevents.com/GDAU10/a.asp?option=G&amp;V=3&amp;id=610243" target="_blank">on a panel at GDC Online</a> next month talking about transmedia stories. Looking forward to it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve heard about Blizzard&#8217;s RealID system, and have seen <a title="Lum provides all the links you need" href="http://brokentoys.org/2010/07/07/realid-scare-mongering-from-a-lot-of-people-with-funny-names/" target="_blank">many of the opinions against the upcoming change</a> to WoW&#8217;s forums.</p>
<p>I think the move is lousy too, for most of the same reasons others have stated. I think ultimately the change is dangerous, both to the customers and to the health of the community. And I say this as someone whose &#8220;real ID&#8221; has been a matter of public record for a number of years now.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another aspect to this I&#8217;d like to talk about which I haven&#8217;t seen discussed so far.</p>
<p>My instinct is that this change will peel away yet another layer of the magic of MMOs: that of being able to pretend you&#8217;re someone else. Sure, anonymity can empower jerks to act like even bigger jerks, but the illusion of the avatar also does great things. It allows disabled gamers to ignore their physical limitations; it allows the meek to act with confidence; it allows the person with an average job and an average life to become a legend.</p>
<p>The danger of connecting MMOs too closely with real life is that it takes away the game&#8217;s function as a vehicle of escape, perhaps even limiting the potential of the game to inspire the imagination. That&#8217;s a heavy price to pay for cutting down on forum spam.</p>
<p>Of course the message boards are technically separate from the game itself, but they represent a big part of the MMO experience for a sizable number of players. That connection is being impacted by the RealID change, which means yet another aspect of the classic MMO experience is being lost&#8211;if you&#8217;re a WoW player, at least.</p>
<p>Now, let me pontificate to MMO developers for a minute.</p>
<p>From personal experience, I know that keeping a gaming forum as useful and troll-free as possible is a huge pain in the ass. Guess what? It&#8217;s also the price you pay for coming to the dance. I don&#8217;t care how big your community is or how many posts you have to moderate&#8211;hire the freaking staff to do the job right. I understand the motive of wanting to create a cleaner environment for your posters, but don&#8217;t take the positive experience away from the good folks in the name of shutting up the asshats.</p>
<p>There is a certain charm in the forum hero known only by a clever handle. The MMOs of tomorrow need to hold onto all the charm they can, not let it slip away&#8211;regardless of the motive.</p>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">
<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">My instinct is that it will  peel away yet another layer of the magic of MMOs&#8211;that of being able to  pretend you&#8217;re someone else.

		<description><![CDATA[What does the original Clash of the Titans have to do with classic MMOs? Find out in this compelling post.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the entire weekend angry that the new <em>Clash of the Titans</em> was so horrible. This was one of the seminal films of my youth, a tale that had nurtured my love for heroic fantasy, and it was utterly ruined by an almost unwatchable farce of a remake.</p>
<p>Monday at work I must have vented my frustration a half-dozen times. At one point, I even proclaimed that I would have been happy if only the film makers had reshot the original script and added updated special effects.</p>
<p>After fuming for a while, I realized I hadn&#8217;t seen the original film in many years. So over lunch I fired up Netflix and bounded over to my instant queue, where I had the old <em>Clash of the Titans</em> waiting for me.</p>
<p>By the time I was 30 minutes in, I realized how utterly wrong I had been. If the original script were shot today, moviegoers would laugh themselves out of the theater. It was bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>So why did I have such fond memories of this film from when I was a kid? While I&#8217;d like to think my tastes in film are more discerning now than when I was a boy, it couldn&#8217;t just be the ignorance of youth. Because despite the movie&#8217;s terrible dialogue and overwrought acting, I had one thing right: the movie told a really good story.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d done was internalize the myth. I&#8217;d taken what was great and resonant about the story and hung onto it, discarding all the nonsense that sticks out like a sore thumb when watching the film today.</p>
<p>We do the same thing with so many aspects of life, including MMOs. Many of us look back on our days in Ultima Online, EverQuest, Asheron&#8217;s Call, and other early online games through the haze of selective memory. We internalize the myths that matter: the long camps that netted a coveted item, the fight to survive a Mistmoore train, your raid wiping and recovering in the wee hours of the morning. These tales are as vivid and vital today as they were when first experienced, and serve as the foundation for countless reminiscences with old friends.</p>
<p>But when I go back to EverQuest to check out the latest expansion or run through a familiar area, the game is virtually unplayable to me. The interface feels archaic, a huge impediment that actually gets in the way of my fun. Yet despite many evolutions over the years, it&#8217;s largely the exact same interface I spent countless hours interacting with.</p>
<p>Interfaces aren&#8217;t memorable. Dialogue and quests fade away.  The myths we internalize are rooted in the heroics of social interaction and the drama of emotional investment. If you can make a game&#8211;or movie, or book, or comic&#8211;with an experience that genuinely moves the audience, you can make something memorable. Because by doing so, you will have touched he myths that lie at the heart of all of us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I, as well as a throng of coworkers, descended upon the first incarnation of PAX East. Though there wasn&#8217;t an official 38 Studios presence (no booth or big announcements this year&#8211;sorry!), our execs were nice enough to give the team the day off to attend opening day of the festivities.</p>
<p>First off, it&#8217;s great to have a major fan-centric gaming event in Boston. The fact that the show sold out for all three days is a testament to how many rabid gamers we have on this side of the country. No question that a show like this was long overdue.</p>
<p>The organizers certainly seemed to have learned a lot from the original PAX in terms of keeping things running smoothly. Though the entrance was a massive choke point (more about this later), once inside things ran like clockwork. It was fast and easy to pick up my badge, and grabbing goodie bags and program guides was a snap. Most of the lower level is a maze-like queue that winds its way toward the second floor, but despite a crowd the line was flowing briskly.</p>
<p>There are some weak points I hope improve next time around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Need a better facility &#8211; The Hynes Convention Center is not a great venue. The entryway was a massive bottleneck compared to more modern facilities. The cement floors and drab walls gave off a prison vibe. It just wasn&#8217;t a pleasant place (although easy access to a decent food court is a plus).</li>
<li>Industry support felt tentative &#8211; The expo floor wasn&#8217;t exactly brimming with exciting booths. Local studio Turbine had a nice area, and a few others (like Realtime Worlds, who showed off APB) did as well. But overall it felt like many big-name publishers had little more than a token presence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps the show&#8217;s proximity to E3 precluded many companies from committing resources, or maybe they just wanted to see how the first year of the show went. Either way, I hope there is more of a big-name presence next year&#8211;and I hope it takes place in a location that better shows all that Boston has to offer.</p>
<p>Overall the arrival of PAX East is a huge boon to gamers and developers alike. I&#8217;m confident the show will be a huge success and will only get better in the years to come.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, March 23, I&#8217;ll be speaking at the <a title="i r a brainiac" href="http://conferences.computer.org/vr/2010/" target="_blank">IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 Conference</a>, taking place in nearby Waltham, MA. The panel is titled &#8220;<a title="so outclassed" href="http://conferences.computer.org/vr/2010/program/panels.html#des" target="_blank">Design for Experience?!</a>&#8221; and if you look at the list of speakers, I am clearly the dumbest guy in the room. I can only assume they had some quota of locals that needed to be filled.</p>
<p>My contribution has the uncharacteristically academic title &#8220;Memorable Experiences in Virtual Worlds.&#8221; Don&#8217;t worry&#8211;I&#8217;m not going all Raphtastic on ya. I&#8217;m building upon the basic premise of my talk with Owlchick last year at GDC Austin, where we asserted that the player&#8217;s stories are more compelling than those made by game designers.</p>
<p>Why does this fit a virtual reality conference? The panel is all about designing user experiences, and I submit that currently the most accessible form of virtual reality is found in massively multiplayer online games. Now I just have to convince the audience of that fact.</p>
