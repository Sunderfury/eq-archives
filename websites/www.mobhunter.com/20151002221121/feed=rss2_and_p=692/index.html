		<description><![CDATA[Glad to see you guys answer the bell like this.  I don&#039;t envy the crunch you guys are likely facing in the coming months, but I&#039;m really looking forward to seeing it all come together....

PS. Now that you&#039;ve spent time on both coasts plus the midwest,  do your Urinal and Stall articles need updating?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve, great video and the setting looks amazing.  You guys NEED to be releasing more information, so many of us have been following this since you and Ryan left SOE, and hearing and seeing nothing.  Make us salivate like ANet has by SHOWING us why we should stay exited for years.

Good stuff, please keep it coming.  Heard you guys were passing on E3, then this week and ugg...  best of luck.

If you build it we will come.]]></description>
