		<description>Jason was always a great guy. You&#039;re absolutely right Ryan, I don&#039;t think he gets enough credit. I tend to forget him because he wasn&#039;t as obvious as Scott, you or Steve. I dealt with you guys regularly but not as much with Jason. I didn&#039;t meet him until later on but he was quite sharp. I thought I saw him on the 38 page. Is that right?</description>

		<description>While Hartsman did a lot when taking the helm on EQII, some people (e.g. Jason Roberts) tend to get far too little of the credit for making EverQuest II such a better game. It took the leadership of Scott Hartsman, the incredible guidance of Jason Roberts, and the dedicated work of dozens of people to get the game into good shape after launch. I&#039;m still proud of what little impact I had on the game, and it will always be a project and experience I look back on fondly.</description>

		<description>I had structured programming crammed into me from the very beginning. But I think C++ tries to circumvent it by hiding code rather than making it more readable. I love C, but not a fan of C++; especialy reading somebody elses code, that&#039;s a nightmare.</description>

		<description>Software maintance is huge but not something taught at schools or even set as an expectation within the industry.  If anything it is a minority that create and build new systems from scratch.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s very fascinating to read about the internal &#039;lives&#039; of MMOs and their developers. Although it may be less exciting (understandably), I think being on a live team is incredibly valuable. You only need to look at the work you guys and everyone did to EQ2 to see how amazing the game became. In many ways, one could argue that it deserves more credit than the intitial creation.</description>

		<description>[...] Eric the Elder Gamer points out that the live team, the team that runs an MMO after it ships, often isn&#8217;t the same group that built it.  Wasn&#8217;t that Scott Hartsman&#8217;s job at SOE?  Anyway, he calls them the &#8220;B-Team,&#8221; at least when it comes to WoW.  Live team people commiserate.
