			<div class="entry">
				<p>In <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=816" target="_blank">last year&#8217;s post</a>, I admitted that I was finally buying more music digitally than on CD. Unsurprisingly, that trend has only escalated in 2014. I bought digital music exclusively except in three cases: 1) it&#8217;s an artist I have a particular fondness for, and I consider their music to be an artifact I wish to own, 2) the CD was cheaper than the digital files, or 3) there was an in-store exclusive version with bonus tracks I desired. That last one is particularly powerful, and Target has proven particularly skilled at grabbing exclusives with a wide variety of artists.</p>
<p>I spent less and less time in record stores, as Amazon has become my shopping destination of choice. What&#8217;s more, their Prime Music library is utterly amazing, and well worth the price of Prime in and of itself. While browsing through pages of thumbnails lacks the tactile pleasure of flipping through music bins, I find the thrill of coming across a great old record and adding to my library nearly as satisfying. And it&#8217;s not just ancient stuff; they have many releases from 2014 that you can grab and enjoy, including several mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado, my list of favorites from another great year of music:<span id="more-835"></span><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Like It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interpol &#8211; <em>El Pintor</em> </strong>- Sometimes a band needs to be away for a while to remind you how much you miss them. Interpol has always lived in the house that Joy Division built, but at their best they have a potency and optimism that belies their darker influences. <em>El Pintor</em> wasn&#8217;t a departure from the band&#8217;s established sound, but that felt to me like a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Adams &#8211; <em>Ryan Adams</em></strong> &#8211; When he released <em>Gold</em> in 2001 and <em></em>Rock N Roll two years later, Adams was poised to become one of the most distinctive songwriters of his generation. I remember reading an interview in which he talked about the high volume of songs he wrote, and how he could release album after album of new material. I thought that sounded like magic. Well, it turned out that while he kept the promise of regularly releasing albums, he rarely managed to reach the heights of those earlier milestones. Still, I buy every record Adams puts out, because I know he&#8217;s capable of greatness. Happily, this year&#8217;s self-titled record harkens back to those classics, and I think it&#8217;s his best effort in a decade. If not quite <em>Gold</em>, it&#8217;s still a valuable addition to his legacy.</p>
<p><strong>Angel Olsen -<em> Burn Your Fire for No Witness</em></strong> &#8211; Olsen&#8217;s record is the darling of many critics&#8217; lists this year, and for good reason. It harnesses the fire of early PJ Harvey while offering more depth. Snarling at times, but the songs have a warmth to them as well. Often stark and harrowing, yet Olsen never drives the listener away.</p>
<p><strong>Chromeo -<em> White Women</em></strong> &#8211; If money was no object and you wanted to book a band to play a high-concept disco party, you&#8217;d hire Daft Punk. But if you wanted to stage a fun, sexy disco soiree, then your money would be better spent on Chromeo. This duo is unabashedly a playful throwback to an earlier age, and in so doing may wind up closer to the spirit of what disco was about in the first place. A great party record, especially if you want to watch your guests get freaky.</p>
<p><strong>Dum Dum Girls &#8211; <em>Too True</em></strong> &#8211; Jangly guitars over female vocals and a bouncy beat describe most of the songs on <em>Too True, </em>a solid turn from this Sub Pop band. At times singer Dee Dee Penny&#8217;s vocals recall Chrissie Hynde or Shirley Manson of Garbage, with a confident, cocky snarl befitting a rock star. Many of the songs project a real sense of fun, making this a really enjoyable album.</p>
<p><strong>Death From Above 1979 &#8211; <em>The Physical World</em></strong> &#8211; After a prolonged absence since their last release, DFA came back with guns blazing this year. Their music is a blend of rock and blues and dance that reminds me of Urge Overkill&#8217;s brief heyday. A band that&#8217;s not afraid to cut loose, but they keep your feet firmly on the dance floor. A welcome return.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Henry &#8211; <em>Invisible Hour</em></strong> &#8211; Every Joe Henry record feels like an artifact, crafted with the same care with which Ken Burns makes a documentary. While Henry usually stays true to form&#8211;quiet songs about flawed characters who might have fallen straight out of a John Steinbeck novel&#8211;there are always so many nuances to his music that it benefits from repeated listening. <em>Invisible Hour</em> is another work of art well worth your scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>Jack White &#8211; <em>Lazaretto</em></strong> &#8211; It always felt to me like the White Stripes were a little overrated, and I&#8217;ve often rolled my eyes at Jack White&#8217;s many Twitter feuds. But there finally came a point where I could no longer deny that the man knows how to make a kick-ass record. <em>Lazaretto</em> is dark and mesmerizing, and just a lot of fun. Maybe I need to go back and give his earlier work another shot.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Messersmith &#8211; <em>Heart Murmurs</em></strong> &#8211; This Minnesota songwriter consistently sells out local venues but deserves a much wider audience. His last several releases have been rock solid, evoking the best of smart, catchy pop music with honesty and depth. A collection of love songs, <em>Heart Murmurs</em> plays with expectations to weave tales of many different types of love. It&#8217;s cleverness that never feels anything less than genuine.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Love It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>St. Vincent &#8211; <em>St. Vincent</em></strong> &#8211; Although I was not overly fond of 2012&#8242;s collaboration with David Byrne, I think the pairing re-energized St. Vincent&#8217;s Annie Clark. Her new record is bombastic and bold, as evidenced by her enigmatic performances on Letterman and SNL. Always offbeat, the latest collection embraces that distinctiveness with a driving set of songs. This record challenges the listener and rewards the effort.</p>
<p><strong>My Brightest Diamond &#8211; <em>This Is My Hand</em></strong> &#8211; Yet another female artist who operates under a <em>nom de plume</em>, MBD&#8217;s Shara Worden is a musical chameleon who can effortlessly shift from chamber to dance music with any number of genres in between. She similarly slinks between emotions in her lyrics, from playful to poignant. Every number is a candidate for a contemporary piece on So You Think You Can Dance&#8211;which, in my book, is high praise.</p>
<p><strong>Hospitality &#8211; <em>Trouble</em></strong> &#8211; Pretty much any band fronted by a smoky-voiced female singer is going to merit a listen from me, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ll fall in love with it. At first, I thought Hospitality might end up in a pile of mediocre releases, but something about <em>Trouble</em> stuck with me. It was probably the Wire-like drone of &#8220;Last Words&#8221; that hooked me, but soon the other songs lured me in. I&#8217;ve returned to this album again and again over the course of the year, and enjoy it more with each visit. Give it a chance and you&#8217;ll mine unexpected depth.</p>
<p><strong>alt-J &#8211; <em>This is All Yours</em></strong> &#8211; This band&#8217;s sound is really hard to pin down. Ranging from electronic to prog to world music, the vocals are often as mercurial as the melodies. But sprinkled in among the many influences are songs that weave their way into your subconscious. Heady stuff, but with a personality that simultaneously welcomes and challenges the listener without being off-putting.</p>
<p><strong>FKA twigs &#8211; <em>LP1</em></strong> &#8211; At turns alluring and unsettling, FKA twigs (ne Tahliah Barnett) defies labels and genres. Sometimes when an artist creates music so resistant to categorization, it comes across as forced. Here, it almost feels like a challenge, as if Barnett is daring you to try to put her in a box. There are hints of classic soul paired with ominous whispers that recall Tricky at his best. Certainly a compelling artist I can&#8217;t wait to see develop further.</p>
<p><strong>Damien Rice &#8211; <em>My Favourite Faded Fantasy</em></strong> &#8211; A songwriter standing onstage and singing his or her heart out is certainly nothing new. But Rice does it like a surgeon, his music stripped to the bare minimum and his lyrics wielded like a scalpel&#8211;deft and precise yet mercilessly sharp. In the eight years since his last album, he&#8217;s lost none of his edge, and cuts most deeply into his own psyche. Every Damien Rice record has moments that stun me with their perceptiveness and vulnerability, so personal that the listener can&#8217;t help but gaze into the mirror as well.</p>
<p><strong>Black Keys &#8211; <em>Turn Blue</em></strong> &#8211; The ever-reliable Black Keys (along with ace producer Danger Mouse) could have simply turned out another collection of radio-ready singles in the vein of their previous mega-seller <em>El Camino</em>. Instead, they released a more brooding, personal record that addresses the challenges and demons which often accompany fame and success. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; there are still hits aplenty, such as the throbbing &#8220;Fever,&#8221; but <em>Turn Blue</em> is not defined by them so much as by introspection.</p>
<p><strong>Warpaint &#8211; <em>Warpaint</em></strong> &#8211; With songs trippy, slow, and sexy, Warpaint weaves an alluring spell. Fans of the xx will find a lot to like here, with spare beats and echoing vocals that pull the listener in. Though this LA ensemble has been around for about seven years, it&#8217;s now that they&#8217;ve found their footing. Thoroughly modern, though at times I hear a (very welcome) hint of the Cocteau Twins or Lush.</p>
<p><strong>TV on the Radio &#8211; <em>Seeds</em></strong> &#8211; While I&#8217;ve found all of TV on the Radio&#8217;s albums enjoyable, &#8220;joy&#8221; is the word that immediately springs to the forefront when listening to <em>Seeds</em>. The songs abound with catchy hooks, and an infectious fervor runs through the record. This is rock at its most spirited and fun, but crafted with satisfying skill.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Gotta Have It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Afghan Whigs &#8211; <em>Do the Beast</em></strong> &#8211; Often when a band is on hiatus for a decade and a half, they come back either diminished or transformed into a new incarnation that is all but unrecognizable. Such is the fear when an act as beloved as Afghan Whigs rises again. Happily, <em>Do the Beast</em> is in every way a worthy successor to previous epics like <em>Gentlemen</em>. From aggro teeth grinders like &#8220;Metamoros&#8221; to slow burners like &#8220;Algiers,&#8221; the Whigs are capable of conveying a startling range of aural sensations. Welcome back, fellas. Stick around a long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>Lana Del Rey &#8211; <em>Ultraviolence</em></strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s possible that Lana Del Rey&#8217;s carefully crafted persona is talked about more than her music. And in fact, that persona is part of the appeal. In my mind, Del Rey is a construct, a theater piece, as much of a disguise as the members of KISS in their makeup. Her lyrics are high-concept costumes, her songs scenes of a play. Whereas <em>Born to Die</em> told the story of a young ingenue discovering that sex can be used as a tool or a weapon, <em>Ultraviolence</em> portrays a more seasoned, cynical character who has achieved success and stands at the height of her powers. Gone are the hip-hop trappings of her previous effort, replaced by rock-tinged torch songs. I hope Lana Del Rey delivers a compelling third act, closing her character&#8217;s story as an aging beauty who reflects on her failings as well as her triumphs. Time will tell how this story plays out, but I&#8217;ll be watching from the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard Cohen &#8211; <em>Popular Problems</em></strong> &#8211; Considering the countless words written about Leonard Cohen in the many decades of his storied career, it&#8217;s unlikely that I&#8217;ll come up with anything original to offer here. All I will say is that, of all his contemporaries, Cohen&#8217;s work feels the most unashamedly human. Our triumphs and our flaws are all on unflinching display. <em>Popular Problems</em> teems with sex and blues and doubt, like all of Cohen&#8217;s best work. Released on his 80th birthday, it feels wizened and reborn all at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Elbow &#8211; <em>The Take Off and Landing of Everything</em></strong> &#8211; Elbow is another group that is hard to classify, bringing Peter Gabriel-esque eclecticism into a modern context. But the songs are the true stars here, with lyrics both introspective and candidly observant. &#8220;I live and die by the hot and cold in strangers&#8217; eyes&#8221; croons singer Guy Garvey, an apt perspective on the life of any artist. The band has been together for 20 years, and the cohesion is evident, yet somehow the music feels fresher than ever. I&#8217;ve played this record countless times over the year, and its depth is always satisfying and astonishing.</p>
<p><strong>First Aid Kit &#8211; <em>Stay Gold</em></strong> &#8211; It may seem improbable for two sisters from Sweden to craft such perfect country-tinged pop songs, but that&#8217;s exactly what has happened on <em>Stay Gold</em>. In fact, I&#8217;m not certain there is anyone else on the planet, in any genre, making harmonies this beautiful. Each sister&#8217;s voice is lovely on its own, but together they are almost hypnotic, startling in their power and warmth. As if that weren&#8217;t enough, their songwriting has improved with each album; their previous effort, <em>The Lion&#8217;s Roar</em>, was replete with memorable gems, but their latest disc is exceptional from start to finish. When I listen to this record, my mind is instantly transported to a vast golden plain where the notes soar like the wind. Utter perfection. My record of the year.
