<html><head><title>Your Weekend Fix</title></head><body><h1>Your Weekend Fix</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-04-26</p><BIG>Console Yourselves</BIG><p>The official <a href="http://everquestonlineadventures.station.sony.com/">EverQuest Online Adventures</a> site is now live, featuring screen shots and a FAQ on the upcoming PS2 game. The design is a lot like the Planes of Power site.<p>Csenicier is the most likely of us Mobhunters to actually buy a PS2, so I'm hoping I'll get to play the game at least a little when it arrives sometime in 2003. My goal is to become high enough level to run to SolB and warn Nagafen that in 500 years he's going to die on a weekly basis if he keeps insisting on carrying around his Cloak of Flames. If I am successful, does that mean CoFs will retroactively disappear from the current game? I better watch some more Star Trek episodes and brush up on my temporal mechanics.<p><BIG>We Know, We Know</BIG><p>Datharius returned to the QA board to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000095.html">inform</a> players that some known issues will be fixed the next time there is new code patched:<p><B>Some issues that we see reported on a very regular basis are:<p>- /yell returning gibberish strings, like &quot; 8^ yells for help from ahead and to the right&quot;<p>- Mobs that deathtouch have a blank shout rather than shouting the name of the player they are deathtouching.<p>- Interrogator quests. There is an NPC who is not spawning properly in South Karana.<p>- Princess Alexandria/Verina Tomb. Princess Alexandria is currently not spawning. Verina Tomb is. <p>All of the above-listed issues are fixed on Test server, and once the new code is ready to go Live, these issues will be resolved on Live as well.</B><p>I'm glad the deathtouch issue will be resolved. I believe firmly that if a mob is going to deathtouch me, it should at least have the common courtesy to get my name right.<p>The promised fixes also include the Complete Heal bug. This killed me for the first time ever last night, so now I actually care about it. Fix it already!!!<p><BIG>The Price of Doing Business</BIG><p>In case you were sleeping, yesterday marked the start of the new pricing scheme for EverQuest, which is based around the $12.95 per month model. Reduced <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/rates/">rates</a> for 12 and 24 month subscriptions are still available, so you might want to take advantage of them while you still can.<p>No, we don't get any kickbacks for saying that, so shut up! You know you're going to keep playing anyway... for 18 more months, at least. It's not like you have anything <a href="http://www.tekzoned.com/spank/">better</a> to do.<p><BIG>Phat Lewtz R Us</BIG><p>Triton's recent first-ever slaying of the Emperor in Ssra Temple resulted in some so-so broken loot. Thankfully, someone at Verant read their <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/">site</a> and made the proper fixes, including major uberfications of the caster robe and the paladin/SK shield.<p>Afterlife took down Vyzh'dra the Cursed for the first time anywhere, which resulted in some <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">uberloot</a> as well, including a 16/20 dagger, a range item with FT6, and a 13/16 beastlord weapon. Waitaminute, a BST-only weapon? Bah, grats Mort on that, I guess.<p>Hey, what's with Afterlife posting loot all of a sudden? Aren't we supposed to figure out drops for ourselves? Did they get a new CEO or something? Did they fire most of their AL Live team?<p>Other Luclin uberitems may see upgrades, too. Rich Waters <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4253">told</a> Casters Realm that lunar itemization is being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-reviews/-/AA9IP6AYACFK5/002-9600378-0679229">reviewed</a>:<p><B>We've been making many changes to improve our processes for designing and itemizing zones and monsters across the board. We have a much better system in place now that should guarantee this problem doesn't come up again. We've got a great crew of designers on the team and I'm confident that players will be very happy with the upcoming fixes. I expect the bulk of the item review to be done in time for the next major patch.</B><p>Okay, so maybe don't hand those junk weapons to Mort just yet.<p><BIG>Forming a Guild Now Easier</BIG><p>A little birdy told us about a new message that guides and GMs received regarding the formation of player guilds:<p><B>Effective immediately, people who wish to create a guild on server do NOT need to have 9 other people present with them. All they need to do is petition for it to be created. They will still have to have the 10 people in chat to approve their guild.<p>I know this is a big change from how we had the done things in the past but let's try to make this transition as smooth as possible. =)</B><p>It's not huge, but it does simplify the whole process a bit. And hey, simplifying tedious processes is a good thing.<p><BIG>Developing News</BIG><p>Casters Realm has a <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4255">transcript</a> of the Producers &amp; Developers panel from the Seattle FanFaire. Most of the news was <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=589254886">covered already</a>, but it's worth reading anyway. Fans of NToV will appreciate the skinny on the infamous Ring of Vulak:<p><B>Take Vulak for example. It worked perfectly on Test. Put onto a full server with a full load and it just doesn't work. So we are working to put in systems so that load doesn't have so much of an impact and we can get our NPC's to do more.</B><p>We don't know what Scott Hartsman really means by NPCs doing more, but it's kinda scary. Maybe mob AI will be added so that Vulak pops and says &quot;Hmmm, there are too many players in my zone for me to function properly. I better DT everyone in this entire wing simultaneously.&quot;<p>Be afraid. Be very afraid.
