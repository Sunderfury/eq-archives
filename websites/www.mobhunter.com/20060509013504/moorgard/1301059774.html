It was something we should have seen coming, but it took us a bit off guard nonetheless:<p><B>In order to update our server for the launch of EverQuest: Shadows of Luclin, all servers will be taken down starting at noon on Monday, December 3rd. They will be brought back up again on Tuesday, December 4th at 8 am (Pacific Time - which is -8:00 GMT).<p>We regret the down time that setting up the new expansion requires. Shadows of Luclin offers some exciting new content as well as a fantastic new graphics engine. We hope that you'll agree with us that Shadows of Luclin is well worth the extended patch time.</B><p>That's right, folks. EverQuest is going to be unavailable for an entire day--at least! With the release of the massive Luclin expansion, who knows what kinks might show up and extend that downtime even further.<p>While some of you already have a few <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=msgview&amp;articleid=128986680&amp;msgid=-364821516">ideas</a> for passing the time, we realize a lot of you might need something else to fill that void usually sated by farming l3wtz in Sebilis.<p>You could play another <a href="http://www.liquid.se/pong.html">game</a> or <a href="http://spyfx.clanpages.com/flash/miniputt.swf">two</a>, which might help distract you. There are <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com/">others</a> you could play, but it probably wouldn't take you a full day to get sick of them.<p>Speaking of games, the good news is that since the patch happens on a Monday, you can take the evening off and watch some <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/mnf/index">football</a>. The bad news, unfortunately, is that it's the Packers vs. the Jaguars, which could be a major suckfest.<p>If you're not into football, there are other things on TV you could watch. One of the top ten shows--on a frighteningly consistent basis--is <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/becker/">Becker</a>. What's the deal with that? I don't know a single person who watches this show, yet it's a huge hit. Must be Ted Danson's new hairpiece or something.<p>There should be some other things you could do... see a movie... attend a play... ask a real live woman out on a date instead of a level 3 druidess in GFay...<p>Aw, who am I kidding? Going a whole day without EQ is gonna suck. It's not as if we <I>can't</I> go a day without playing EQ--we can, honest. But to have it forced upon us this way... it's bound to cause withdrawl. As if Mondays weren't crappy enough, this downtime is going to make it worse.<p>We'll just be hoping that, come Tuesday, Luclin is indeed ready for exploration.<p>That's right, folks. <B>Tuesday!</B> The wait is almost over.
