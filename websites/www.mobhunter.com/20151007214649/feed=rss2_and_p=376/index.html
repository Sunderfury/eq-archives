		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m loving WotLK so far. I have leveled my ret pally up to 80 already and have been through all the regular dungeons at least once. (Got the achievement too!) 

I absolutely love their use of the phasing technology!!!!!!!!!!!!! The most memorable quest for me wasn&#039;t really a huge dynamic quest or anything really important, but the results and use of the phasing stunned me. In Icecrown through a series of quests you eventually get to one where you are supposed to protect some builders while they build a tower. That&#039;s right, build a tower. Now, all you really see while you are fighting off mobs is three dwarves swinging hammers in a static location, however, once you have successfully defended them the phasing kicks in. The quest finisher appears, you turn in the quest and all of a sudden a tower appears along with vendors, more quest givers and a flight path. 

I was stunned. Sure, I&#039;ve been through the DK starting quests and I completed the Wrathgate questline which turns the valley into a flame filled wasteland, but I had not even considered them using it to &quot;add&quot; new quest hubs and flight paths that weren&#039;t even there before. 

Now I am obsessed with going back and completing all the rest of the quests just to see if there was anything I missed by not doing them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;Wolfshead&quot;&gt;The question is though: what is fun?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#039;s all relative. We used to have these discussions on various message boards and I&#039;ve always believed you could boil MMO gamers down into two main camps. 

The first camp is the group of people want to be entertained. To them, an MMO is no different than a game of chess, a hand of poker, or a match against a buddy in Madden when it comes to entertainment value. It&#039;s a GAME to them, in the purest sense of the word. Unvarnished entertainment. Fun. And for those people, fun is THE keyword. It&#039;s not anything else. So the whole risk/reward aspect, or the raid tactics, or whatever, none of those things have nearly as much impact on them as the raw entertainment value of the thing. And the minute their fun gets diminished because of obstacles, they&#039;re gone.  

The second group of people are more carrot-oriented. It&#039;s not so much about being entertained as it is working toward a goal. They&#039;re goal-oriented people. They enjoy overcoming challenges, obstacles; they like feeling like they&#039;re earning something. They don&#039;t like tedious tasks and repetitive quests, but they&#039;ll do it if it means something bigger and grander at the end. These are the people who put together the dragon-slaying guilds and push the limits of the content. 

Now, you could put a game of checkers down in front of the two camps and ask them to play each other, and they could potentially have &#039;fun&#039;, but for vastly different reasons. A camp 1 player is going to have fun if he just enjoys the act of playing checkers; if the checkers look neat and he feels like he&#039;s &quot;winning&quot; most of the time. A camp 2 player could have fun too - if he&#039;s achieving his objectives. If there are no objectives, he&#039;ll make up his own. Like, &quot;I need to the next six games in a row, or I start over&quot;. That&#039;s just the way they operate. 

Over the years, I&#039;ve come to believe there are a lot more camp 1 folks than camp 2. And I don&#039;t think that&#039;s good or bad; it&#039;s just how it is. 

I&#039;m a camp 2 guy myself. I like challenge, I like risk/reward, I enjoy goal-setting and achievement. I&#039;m wired that way. But I totally get that there is a another camp of gamers, and they&#039;re numbers are bigger than mine. And I don&#039;t have a problem with that. 

The smart developers are going to build content for everyone anyway. And that&#039;s what Blizzard has done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just took advantage of the free 10-day &quot;welcome back&quot;.  I rolled up a Night Elf Druid and am having a lot of fun.  My biggest problem with WoW is the art.  But I&#039;m past that.  I agree...it&#039;s easy to play WoW.  AoC was a grind.  WAR is too complex at a time for me when life is too complex.  WoW is just easy to load, logon, read quest and play.  I&#039;m not sure I will play past the 10-day free &quot;welcome back&quot;, especially since GTAIV for the PC is out now.  But who knows?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good point about fun. Fun is at the top of the game designers pyramid. Challenge, lore, class design and other gameplay elements should ultimately be subservient to fun. The question is though: what is fun? Is fun getting something for free or is fun working for something? Ah, there&#039;s the rub.

I agree that Blizzard put a lot of *fun* into the Deathknight. No one can deny that the DK is a triumph of design, effects and even the DK quest/storyline which is masterfully executed -- clearly they pulled out all the stops. Personally I was hoping for more of a transformative personal epic quest where a player would sacrifice their high level character and turn into a Death Knight. I doubt that would have been a problem for most players that have a stable full of maxed out characters. At least that would have been unique and involved some element of cost from the player. 

To me the DK, looks like a freebie, loss leader devised to entice players to purchase the expansion: &quot;Thank you for purchasing Wrath of the Lich King, here is your level 55 Death Knight...&quot;. No doubt Blizzard will again break all records. What concerns me is the about the long term impact of hero classes (more coming I&#039;m sure) on the existing class framework and the overall health of the game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;To be honest, the DK feels more like a “welfare” class then it does a hero class. There is nothing heroic required of the player in order to play a Deathknight. It’s very disappointing. Power should always be earned and not bestowed. Clearly the devs at Blizzard have forgotten this core design principle. In the end the DK is pure gimmickry, used to help market and sell an expansion from a company that has become addicted to their own “millions served” press releases.&quot;

This is exactly the attitude a gaming company should take if they want to watch their subscribers drop 95%. This is the sort of thing EQ did for years and now all thats left are a bunch of guilds struggling to find meaning in three years of obsolete content they can&#039;t defeat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with your spoiler-filled discussion. I played through the DK quest line myself, as did my wife, and we both loved it. i had a hard time getting my head around the changing zones until you described it as a new technology. Were they instances? Did the zone really change? It was hard to figure out.

Like you, I stopped just as my blood elf DK (we even picked the same race) got to Outland. I expect it&#039;s hard to put an entire set of content in to level the next ten levels but from what I understand, 40 hours and a quest guide will get you to Northrend pretty quick.

Overall, I&#039;m really impressed with WotLK. It&#039;s everything a good MMO should be - except it should be on a console.]]></description>

I don&#039;t buy the moral choices thing. This is a &lt;I&gt;death knight.&lt;/I&gt; The character isn&#039;t about moral choices (nor is the WoW storyline, for that matter). It wouldn&#039;t fit the class. I would, however, have liked for the rebellion against Arthas to have a personal side to it rather than having it just be my character following orders.

		<description><![CDATA[Heh the biggest draw to me as well was because I was absolutly in love with my shadow knight in eq1... for 5 years I barly played another character.  So I chose to try the DK and Dear god it is awsome...   I am 71 on my way to 72 now and it is just so much fun... I am going with a frost tank build ( my server and imm sure many servers ) have tank and healer shortages... so the only problem ive had getting groups thus far is .... peoples ignorance to the DK.

Here is a hint for avoiding alot of the dk&#039;s on your server thought with it being out a few days now it might be a little harder. skip zones after The BS with hellfire I compleatly skipped zangermarsh  and went right to the forrest... and it was nearly empty YAY I then skipped negrand as well and went right to blades ... I saw 3 people the entire time I was there... I then went to shadowmoon vally got to 68 and went to northrend. ( at 68 I reccomend doing the starting quests of both 68 - 71  areas very quick and easy quests went from 68 - 69 in 2 hours and 7 min including the travel time ) 

the &quot;clown&quot; suits in northrend at least for plate does not look bad... a little on the plain side... but id MUCH rather loook plain then fugly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The idea of time phasing was introduced if I&#039;m not mistaken by Turbine in Lord of the Rings Online. Each player would start off in their own instance which explained the introductory story, then they would be funneled into a phased &quot;newbie&quot; area where they would have to stay until they completed the final quest. Then they&#039;d be dumped into the world at large. I think this technique has some very good potential if used on a wider scale.

As far as the Death Knight, I feel the class is fundamentally flawed which I have discussed endlessly on my blog. It&#039;s obvious that Blizzard spent a lot of time and resources on making the DK starting area amazing in order to sell their very first hero class. The problem is that you as a player are forced into committing evil and repugnant acts if you want to progress your character. Too bad that Blizzard didn&#039;t give players the ability to make moral choices like in Fable -- that would have been revolutionary. With the DK, one gets the feeling that they are on an elaborate amusement park ride with very little if any input from the player.

Of course most players will enjoy playing a DK -- who wouldn&#039;t want to play Superman? Who also wouldn&#039;t want to get 55 levels free from Blizzard and start off with a high level character complete with epic mount, free port ability, blue gear, and bad ass graphic and sound effects?

To be honest, the DK feels more like a &quot;welfare&quot; class then it does a hero class. There is nothing heroic required of the player in order to play a Deathknight. It&#039;s very disappointing. Power should always be earned and not bestowed. Clearly the devs at Blizzard have forgotten this core design principle.  In the end the DK is pure gimmickry, used to help market and sell an expansion from a company that has become addicted to their own &quot;millions served&quot; press releases.]]></description>

It&#8217;s obvious that Blizzard spent a lot of time and resources on making the DK starting area amazing in order to sell their very first hero class. The problem is that you as a player are forced into committing evil and repugnant acts if you want to progress your character. Too bad that Blizzard didn&#8217;t give players the ability to make moral choices like in Fable &#8212; that would have been revolutionary. With the DK, one gets the feeling that they are on an elaborate amusement park ride with very little if any input from the player.</p>
<p>Of course most players will enjoy playing a DK &#8212; who wouldn&#8217;t want to play Superman? Who also wouldn&#8217;t want to get 55 levels free from Blizzard and start off with a high level character complete with epic mount, free port ability, blue gear, and bad ass graphic and sound effects?</p>
<p>To be honest, the DK feels more like a &#8220;welfare&#8221; class then it does a hero class. There is nothing heroic required of the player in order to play a Deathknight. It&#8217;s very disappointing. Power should always be earned and not bestowed. Clearly the devs at Blizzard have forgotten this core design principle.  In the end the DK is pure gimmickry, used to help market and sell an expansion from a company that has become addicted to their own &#8220;millions served&#8221; press releases.</p>
