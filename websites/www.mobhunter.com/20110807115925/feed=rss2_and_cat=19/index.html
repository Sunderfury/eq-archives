<p>Click on this fancy doodad to have a listen.</p>
<p>Or, you can do one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download it <a title="teh downloadz" href="http://www.nerfbat.com/podcasts/massive6.mp3" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Apart from our usual antics (this time including possibly our most annoying gag ever), all we&#8217;re doing is talking about Lich King. So if all you want to do is hate on WoW, you probably want to skip this one.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those of you holding your breath for the next episode of Massive Guys on Massive Games are&#8230; well, you died a few weeks back. For the rest of you, <a title="It's like two geniuses talking, except the opposite" href="http://www.mmopodcast.com/" target="_blank">Episode 3 is finally available!</a></p>
<p>Listen to this masterpiece of modern podcasting by clicking the audio doodad (assuming I get it working).</p>
<p>Or, you can do one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download it <a title="teh downloadz" href="http://www.nerfbat.com/podcasts/massive3.mp3" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Subscribe to the <a title="Feed me" href="http://www.nerfbat.com/?feed=podcast" target="_blank">podcast feed</a>.</li>
<li>If you like it and want to give us money, <a title="Money" href="http://www.nerfbat.com/donate/" target="_blank">find out how</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because we care about our listeners, we have once again kept the rambling to a mere ten minutes. C&#8217;mon people, you spend longer than that in the john each day. Listening to Shwayder and I is at least as productive, if somewhat less satisfying.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usually I know better than to listen to Shwayder&#8217;s stupid ideas, but he somehow managed to convince me to work together on a podcast. The first episode is up now. Called <a href="http://www.mmopodcast.com" title="How had nobody snagged this domain before?" target="_blank">Massive Guys on Massive Games</a> (the title being the only clever thing about it), its saving grace is that we will keep our episodes to ten minutes or less. So while it&#8217;s a waste of your life to listen to it, it&#8217;s only a very small chunk of your life that you probably won&#8217;t miss anyway.</p>
<p>The broadcast is hosted over on <a href="http://www.nerfbat.com/2008/04/13/podcast-test/" title="Pain. Sheer pain." target="_blank">Nerfbat</a>. Subscribe to future episodes (which, on the bright side, can only get better) via <a href="http://www.nerfbat.com/?feed=podcast" title="A feed... of poison!" target="_blank">the feed</a>. Or just <a href="http://www.nerfbat.com/podcasts/massive1.mp3" title="Download and delete. It's fun!" target="_blank">download the damned thing here</a>.</p>
