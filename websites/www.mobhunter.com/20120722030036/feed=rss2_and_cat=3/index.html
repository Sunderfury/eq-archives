			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a big freaking list. Either I&#8217;m getting worse at narrowing down my choices for favorite albums, or maybe it really was just that good a year. There were a ton of releases I really liked, with an exciting blend of new talent along with reliable veterans making some of their best records in ages.</p>
<p>The downside of this phenomenon is that it takes me a hell of a long time to write this annual music post, and I&#8217;m inherently lazy. But man, there&#8217;s some music here I just really have to talk about. So here we go.</p>
<p><span id="more-669"></span><strong>&gt;&gt; Like It &lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>She Wants Revenge &#8211; <em>Valleyheart</em></strong><em> </em>- Though their latest effort is less consistent than their first two records, there are enough good songs on <em>Valleyheart</em> to justify further faith in the band. When they&#8217;re at their best, they  explore the obsessive/compulsive side of sex and love. When the band  misses the mark, it&#8217;s because they get a bit too self-indulgent. I hope a  little more darkness creeps into their next record.</p>
<p><strong>St. Vincent &#8211; <em>Strange Mercy</em></strong> &#8211; I must admit this was one of the records I was waiting all year to hear, because the last album, <em>Actor</em>, was unadulterated brilliance. <em>Strange Mercy</em> is a bit more grounded and, in places, slower moving than its  predecessor. Still a really strong record, though I&#8217;m not sure anything  could live up to my expectations. Honestly, I&#8217;m trying not to sound like  a downer&#8211;this is great stuff&#8211;but I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s gripped me as much  as I&#8217;d hoped.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Waits -<em> Bad As Me</em></strong><em> </em>- If you&#8217;re intimidated by  the huge and varied back catalog of Tom Waits but want to dive in and  discover what all the fuss is about, <em>Bad As Me</em> makes a fantastic  entry point. Waits sounds as gravelly as ever, and the songs here are as  accessible as anything he&#8217;s done before.</p>
<p><strong>Lights &#8211; <em>Siberia</em></strong><em> </em>- How does a Canadian electronica act make my annual list of favorite records? By releasing an album of catchy, danceable anthems that happen to be great pop songs. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that Valerie Anne Poxleitner has the kind of spare, hypnotic vocals that I find so intriguing.  The production here is tight and direct, emphasizing the charm but  retaining a hint of the bleak landscape that gives the album its title.</p>
<p><strong>The Lonely Island &#8211; <em>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</em></strong> &#8211; Usually, musical comedy albums have a pretty short shelf life for me.  Exceptions to this rule&#8211;including records by Flight of the Conchords  and the Lonely Island&#8211;are because the songs are more than funny; they  are legitimately catchy. To successfully spoof any art form, you have to  understand its principles. The Lonely Island knows its stuff, and  peppers in enough guest stars to keep the album timely and relevant. Did  I mention these are just plain good songs? Sure, some are better than  others, but the stand-outs make the disc worth the listen.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Winehouse &#8211; <em>Lioness: Hidden Treasures</em></strong> &#8211; In a better world, this year&#8217;s list would include Amy&#8217;s second or third new album since her breakthrough <em>Back to Black</em>,  and I&#8217;d be raving about her continued genius. Sadly, we live in this  world, where Winehouse was unable to overcome debilitating addictions  that eventually took her life. So instead we&#8217;re left with bits and  pieces, fragments of what might have been. This is a great collection,  but its flavor is unquestionably bittersweet. Oh, what might have been.</p>
<p><strong>The Airborne Toxic Event &#8211; <em>All at Once</em> </strong>- After a solid  debut album a couple years back, the ATE returned with an even better  follow-up. The influences are quite varied, with some cuts sounding a  bit like Joy Division/early New Order while others are much more joyous  and relaxed. A great alternative pop record that isn&#8217;t ashamed to get  your feet tapping.</p>
<p><strong>EMA &#8211; <em>Past Life Martyred Saints</em></strong> &#8211; Critical darling EMA may  be a young PJ Harvey in the making. She&#8217;s not there yet, but Erika M.  Anderson has all the right ingredients: angst, edginess, and axes to  grind. Her debut solo album is loose enough to take the listener in a  lot of different directions; it will be interesting to see which path  EMA ventures down in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Apex Manor &#8211; <em>The Year of Magical Drinking</em></strong> &#8211; This was  one of the first albums I bought in 2011, and it remained a solid listen  all year long. Apex Manor veers from catchy indie pop to  Replacements-style raunchiness, all with a directness and charm that  feels absolutely genuine. Don&#8217;t let this album slip under your radar.</p>
<p><strong>The Decemberists &#8211; <em>The King is Dead</em></strong> &#8211; There are few  bands in the universe more charming than the Decemberists&#8211;seeing them  live even once will convince you of this. Yet their last couple records  have been a bit disappointing to me, trading the brilliant naivete of <em>Picaresque</em> for heavier-handed, over-produced material. <em>The King is Dead</em> is a return to form, focusing on catchy songs that tell great stories.  That&#8217;s exactly what I hope for from a Decemberists record.</p>
<p><strong>Foo Fighters &#8211; <em>Wasting Light</em></strong> &#8211; Despite Courtney Love&#8217;s  eternal ire, Foo Fighters have released some of the most solid and  dependable alternative/pop records of the last 15 years. Yet rarely have  they felt as well-crafted and complete as this year&#8217;s <em>Wasting Light</em>,  a project rich with the band&#8217;s penchant for catchy hooks and soaring  choruses. Whatever has fueled Dave Grohl&#8217;s ambitions, I hope he consumes  more of it, because this set is catchy and tight with nary a wasted  note. And having the legendary Bob Mould appear on the infectious &#8220;Dear  Rosemary&#8221; was a work of perfect pop genius.</p>
<p><strong>Gillian Welch &#8211; <em>The Harrow &amp; the Harvest</em> </strong>- Welch  has been around a long time, both as a solo artist and as a collaborator  with the likes of Ryan Adams, the Decemberists, and countless others.  Her latest effort is a charming folk/country affair that highlights what  she&#8217;s best at: writing great, moving songs. You&#8217;ll find no artifice  here, but plenty of direct, engaging art.</p>
<p><strong>Zola Jesus- <em>Conatus</em></strong> &#8211; Another relative newcomer, Nika Roza  Danilova blends goth, electronica, and a hint of prog into a layered  sound that belies her years. The sound is so thick in places that you  have to cut through it with a knife, but as you dig deeper you find more  and more that captivates. Treat this record like a treasure hunt or just let the music wash over you&#8211;your choice.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Love It &lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bon Iver &#8211; <em>Bon Iver</em></strong> &#8211; How do you follow up a record as iconic and intensely personal as 2008&#8242;s brilliant <em>For Emma, Forever Ago</em>?  In Bon Iver&#8217;s case, you maintain the emotional heart while expanding  upon the cabin-in-the-woods sound of the first album. This would be a  tricky act for anyone to pull off, but Justin Vernon and crew make it  sound effortless. The fuller production never gets in the way of songs  that just take hold and refuse to let go. Having cleared this sophomore  hurdle, the future is wide open for this band.</p>
<p><strong>Elbow &#8211; <em>Build a Rocket Boys!</em></strong> &#8211; If Elbow had no greater  ambitions than to be a Peter Gabriel cover band, they probably could  have made a pretty good living, since singer Guy Garvey has a rare  ability to match the former Genesis frontman&#8217;s range and tone with eerie  precision. Instead, thankfully, Elbow has opted to make clever and  challenging records that can appeal to the art-house crowd while still  blending into a post-Coldplay world. The songs range from soaring and  inspiring to gritty and burrowing, a balanced blend that conveys an  impressive range of talent.</p>
<p><strong>Brendan Perry &#8211; <em>Ark</em></strong><em> </em>- Maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s  been so long since the last Dead Can Dance record, but there is  something delightful about this album that was lacking on Perry&#8217;s first  solo effort, <em>Eye of the Hunter</em>. Sure, <em>Ark</em> is rich with  Perry&#8217;s signature mopey croon, and the lyrics still dance on the  precipice of pretentiousness, but there&#8217;s also a joyfulness and  immediacy to the songs that I find compelling. The usual array of exotic  instruments and sounds is here, but this time out it&#8217;s tempered by  layered synthesizers and danceable beats. Give this record a shot and  you could find something unexpectedly delightful.</p>
<p><strong>Cults &#8211; <em>Cults</em></strong><em> </em>- If, on first listen, you had  told me that this catchy wall-of-sound record was crafted in the 60s by  legendary producer and psychopath Phil Spector, I probably would have  believed you. But digging deeper uncovers a pop-punk sensibility that  brings this collection of crisp songs into the modern age. If you can  resist shaking your thang to this infectious album, I think there&#8217;s  probably something wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>Iron &amp; Wine &#8211; <em>Kiss Each Other Clean; Morning Becomes Eclectic</em></strong> -  I must confess that, if I had my druthers, I&#8217;d lock Sam Beam in a  room with an acoustic guitar and a four-track recorder and wouldn&#8217;t let  him out until he&#8217;d produced a handful of albums that sounded like the  epic and wonderful <em>Our Endless Numbered Days</em>. While <em>Kiss Each Other Clean</em> proves once again that Beam is as great a songwriter as anyone working  today, its dense production styles makes me long for the less refined  sound of his earlier efforts. The KCRW <em>Morning Becomes Eclectic</em> serves as a testament to the purity of the core songs, as the live  format really makes the material shine. At the risk of sounding like a  musical Luddite, I hope Iron &amp; Wine returns to a more stripped-down  sound in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Bush &#8211; <em>Director&#8217;s Cut; 50 Words for Snow</em></strong> &#8211; To describe Kate Bush as influential is  the greatest of  understatements; you need only look at many of the other acts on this  list to see plenty of examples of how much she has shaped a whole  generation of talent. Though prolific in her early years, she&#8217;s been  heartbreakingly quiet in the past decade plus. So when she released <em>Director&#8217;s Cut</em> earlier in the year, we had to assume that this collection of revised  cuts from two earlier albums would have to tie us over for a few years.  That wasn&#8217;t so bad, since the album brought some much-needed freshness  to some great songs that suffered from 1990s production values. Yet much  to my surprise, Kate was true to her claim that new music would be  coming soon by releasing <em>50 Words for Show</em> before the end of the  year. Despite the title, it&#8217;s not a Christmas album, although winter is  certainly a major thematic element. Instead of carols, you&#8217;ll find  Kate&#8217;s gorgeous voice delivering some lovely new songs, mostly featuring  piano and vocals. Though my favorite of her albums remains the epic <em>Hounds of Love</em>, the new effort has enough interesting twists to prove that Kate has what it takes to inspire yet another generation.</p>
<p><strong>David Sylvian &#8211; <em>Died in the Wool</em></strong><em> </em>- For an artist  who isn&#8217;t fond of looking back on previous work, Sylvian has been doing  a lot of it lately. With this collection, he turns his recent <em>Manafon </em>album  over to composer Dai Fujikura, who took the spare original tracks and  layered in classical arrangements. The strategy mostly works, though I  confess I enjoyed the open feeling of the original recordings in most  cases. Still, the new songs here are standouts, more than justifying the  existence of <em>Died in the Wool</em>.</p>
<p><strong>My Brightest Diamond &#8211; <em>All Things Will Unwind</em></strong> &#8211; Shara Worden has  covered a vast amount of musical ground with her My Brightest Diamond  project, blending elements of rock and pop and classical with her  amazingly distinct vocals. Her latest focuses more on the classical side  of things, but her lyrics&#8211;as well as the music itself&#8211;run the gamut  from thoughtful to playful. The newest album hasn&#8217;t gripped me quite as much as <em>A Thousand Shark&#8217;s Teeth</em>, but this is the kind of record that works its way slowly under your skin and makes the investment worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Gabriel &#8211; <em>New Blood</em></strong> &#8211; Oh look, another aging  artist records classical versions of his old hits. That&#8217;s a formula a  lot of listeners might opt to overlook, but don&#8217;t dismiss this effort so  quickly. As he&#8217;s done before, Gabriel takes what sounds like an old  idea and makes it interesting. There&#8217;s plenty of lush and lovely moments  like &#8220;In Your Eyes&#8221; and &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221;, but the first time I heard  &#8220;Intruder&#8221; I was driving home late on a foggy night and just about peed  my pants at the creepiness of it. Gabriel really did find a way to pump  some new blood into these songs, and the effort is well worth the  listen.</p>
<p><strong>Radiohead &#8211; <em>The King of Limbs; TKOL RMX 1234567</em></strong> &#8211; It was a busy year for Radiohead, with both a new record and a very worthwhile remix set released (they sneaked out a live  DVD as well). There&#8217;s no question the band remains hugely influential,  but are they still fresh and relevant? I say yes&#8211;the songs here are  just so damned compelling that you almost can&#8217;t help but be drawn in.  Radiohead somehow takes a modern sound and layers it with the feel of  jazz improv. It&#8217;s a siren&#8217;s call that consistently makes me want more.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Flag &#8211; <em>Wild Flag</em></strong> &#8211; Music remains inherently tied to image and artifice; that&#8217;s part of its charm as well as its detriment. So when a band comes along that eschews  image and focuses on the simple things that make rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll so great  and enduring, you just have to go with it. The gals of Wild Flag bring  with them an impressive indie rock pedigree, but all that would mean  nothing if the songs here weren&#8217;t so damned awesome. There&#8217;s no fakery  or posing to be found here; simply put, they will rock the shit out of  you. And I think that&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Gotta Have It &lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fleet Foxes &#8211; <em>Helplessness Blues</em></strong> &#8211; After a fantastic  debut album, a group has nowhere to go but down on the next one, right?  In the case of Fleet Foxes, that assumption couldn&#8217;t be more wrong.  Somehow the band manages yet another collection of rousing, touching  songs with vocal harmonies that seem almost impossibly surreal&#8211;like  they come from some other planet. <em>Helplessness Blues</em> has a timeless quality that is both classic and modern. Don&#8217;t question it; just listen.</p>
<p><strong>The Knux &#8211; <em>Eraser</em></strong><em> </em>- On this ridiculously catchy  record, the Knux effortlessly blend hip-hop with the purest pop-punk  sensibility. There is nothing wasted here&#8211;just three chords, catchy  beats, and hooks galore. If it weren&#8217;t for the foul language  necessitating a warning sticker, this album could (and should) have been  all over the radio. I defy you to listen to these songs without tapping  your toes at the very least. More than likely, you&#8217;ll be shaking what  the good lore gave ya.</p>
<p><strong>Florence + the Machine &#8211; <em>Ceremonials</em></strong><em> </em>- At the  risk of repeating myself, here&#8217;s another act that had the potential to  flounder a follow-up to a hugely successful first record, yet managed to  knock it out of the park. <em>Ceremonials</em> takes the best of what  went before and kicks it up a notch. The beats are bigger, the anthems  more anthemic, and the soaring vocals simply rocket out of the  stratosphere. Florence is an artist who, instead of sliding by on past  popularity, took what she&#8217;d earned and poured 100% of it back into her  craft. An amazing album.</p>
<p><strong>TV On the Radio &#8211; <em>Nine Types of Light</em></strong> &#8211; This is another  band that&#8217;s hard to categorize thanks to their effortless blending of  varied musical styles. Yet nothing feels forced or unnatural here; the  band has perfected its own sound that simply works. Underneath it all  are solid songs that rock when they should and are poignant when they  need to be. This album covers an expanse of musical ground, yet it all  just feels right. What a great band.</p>
<p><strong>The Black Keys &#8211; <em>El Camino</em></strong> &#8211; On another collaboration with producer Danger Mouse, the Black Keys deliver their signature blend of blues, funk, and 70s power rock&#8211;this time with a somewhat greater emphasis on the latter. Why change a formula that works? Their songs are catchy and fun, with sexy grooves that conjure Bad Company and even Led Zeppelin in their heyday. The Keys aren&#8217;t reinventing the wheel here, but they have honed their craft and are writing the best songs of their career. This is a great album.</p>
<p><strong>PJ Harvey &#8211; <em>Let England Shake</em></strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if PJ has  been listening to a Matt Johnson marathon, but not since The The&#8217;s  classic albums of the late 80s/early 90s has there been so crisp and  direct a musical criticism of the UK&#8217;s politics and customs. Harvey has  never sounded better, somehow staying absolutely fresh and vital. Proof  that great songs can be both instantly catchy and thought-provokingly  deep. Runner-up for my album of the year.</p>
<p><strong>The Civil Wars &#8211; <em>Barton Hollow</em></strong> &#8211; Once in a while a band comes along that sounds like it&#8217;s been together for a thousand years, where everything they do sounds inherent to their very being, with nothing forced or unnatural. The Civil Wars are such a group. The songs on <em>Barton Hollow</em> are instantly gripping and mesmerizing, rising above a folk/country/pop crowd in effortless and ethereal fashion. Every piece on this record is like a soundtrack to its own film, gripping and personal and haunting. This is one of those records that fills you with wistfulness, longing, and just about every kind of emotion. Throughout the year, this is the one I&#8217;ve come back to time and time again. My record of the year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the whole, 2010 was a fantastic year for new music. A lot of my favorite bands released albums, and a whole crop of new artists showed up with awesome material.</p>
<p>It was a struggle for me to name a single Album of the Year; for the first time since I&#8217;ve been doing this feature, any entry in the &#8220;Gotta Have It&#8221; category could easily have earned the distinction. So please, consider every album in that group a required purchase.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s list comes with a brand new feature: an iTunes playlist showcasing some of my favorite tracks of the year. In addition to picking standout tracks, I tried to create a nice flow from one to another. Let me know what you think.</p>
<p><span id="more-630"></span>&gt;&gt; <strong>Like It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ryan Adams &amp; The Cardinals &#8211; <em>III/IV</em> </strong>- While its not unusual for an artist to have some leftover tracks after the completion of an album of new material, it isn&#8217;t common for there to be two discs worth&#8211;unless the artist in question is Ryan Adams. Fans know how ridiculously prolific he can be, and also know that just because these tracks are &#8220;leftovers&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean they are lacking in quality. In fact, the songs in this double set stand up very well alongside <em>Easy Tiger</em>, the previous album Adams released with The Cardinals.</p>
<p><strong>Local Natives &#8211; <em>Gorilla Manor</em></strong> &#8211; We didn&#8217;t get a new album from Fleet Foxes this year, but Local Natives delivered a record with harmonies nearly as skillful and appealing. This band is no cheap knock-off, though; their song structures and instrumentation have a distinct feel that ventures more into the quirky than the Foxes ever do.</p>
<p><strong>Sleigh Bells &#8211; <em>Treats</em></strong><em> </em>- Combine distorted beats, arena rock guitar, and lilting female vocals that alternate between a hip-hop cadence and alternapop catchiness and you get close to describing the sound of Sleigh Bells. This over-amplified aural odyssey induces an almost trance-like state when you crank it up, and you fall more deeply under its spell after repeated listens.</p>
<p><strong>Band of Horses &#8211; <em>Infinite Arms</em></strong> &#8211; I can&#8217;t exactly lay my finger on why this album didn&#8217;t resonate with me as much as their first two efforts. Perhaps some of the slower songs just sounded, apart from the distinctive vocals, like rote power ballads. Still worth a listen, but I can&#8217;t recommend this disc as highly as I would have liked.</p>
<p><strong>Kanye West</strong><strong> &#8211; <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em></strong> &#8211;  Musically, I agree with the many critics who praise this album as a  work of genius. Lyrically, it&#8217;s a very mixed bag for me. While there are  moments of genuine introspection and insight, they are undermined by  needless posing and misogynous lyrics. I admire a lot about this record,  but I can&#8217;t get myself to love it.</p>
<p><strong>Crowded House &#8211; <em>Intriguer</em></strong><em> </em>- Crowded House will always be one of my favorite bands, and <em>Temple of Low Men</em> still stands as one of my desert island albums. There are songs on <em>Intriguer</em> which stand well alongside their earlier work, but I was left a bit cold by some of the more run-of-the-mill numbers. Nevertheless, if you have an opportunity to see the band live, please take it&#8211;you&#8217;ll not regret a moment of the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Interpol &#8211; <em>Interpol</em></strong><em> </em>- This band stands out from the crowd of similar goth-tinged rock bands by showcasing a quirky side. Just when you think you know where one of their songs is going, it suddenly jerks in another direction. It works better on some tracks than others, and I&#8217;m not sure how long they can keep using the same bag of tricks, but the songs on this eponymous release are catchy and interesting enough to overcome the concern that the band may be going to the well a bit too often.</p>
<p><strong>Philip Selway &#8211; <em>Familial</em></strong><em> </em>- Unless you&#8217;re a  die-hard Radiohead fan, you&#8217;re unlikely to know that Mr. Selway is the  band&#8217;s drummer. That&#8217;s okay; it took a sticker on the album cover  reminding me of such to get me to make this purchase. And I&#8217;m glad I  did&#8211;though its singer/songwriter vibe is a complete departure from the  sound of modern Radiohead, the songs here are potent and enjoyable. The  disc starts off strong and wanders a bit, but it&#8217;s a fantastic first  effort from an artist I hope we get to hear a lot more from.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Love It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Sylvian &#8211; <em>Sleepwalkers</em></strong><em> </em>- This collection of collaborative tracks isn&#8217;t a new album per se, but it combines new material with remixes and some fairly obscure tracks that had been scattered about various projects over the past decade. It makes a pretty good overview of Sylvian&#8217;s recent work, which is to say it touches a wide variety of genres. His solo albums, such as last year&#8217;s <em>Manafon</em>, tend to be very focused on a single sound, while this compilation allowed for a much wider latitude of styles.</p>
<p><strong>Daft Punk &#8211; <em>TRON Legacy Soundtrack</em></strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m not a huge fan of listening to movie scores without their visual context, but this effort by the always interesting Daft Punk is deeply satisfying on its own. They really captured the feel of the film while creating a work that stands up without it. A really great transmedia experience.</p>
<p><strong>The National &#8211; <em>High Violet</em></strong> &#8211; If Interpol and Editors wouldn&#8217;t exist without Joy Division, then the National wouldn&#8217;t exist without the Tindersticks. This band has a brooding, introspective vibe that could easily fall into self indulgence, but their music and lyrics possess enough grace and optimism to ultimately be uplifting. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that they can write a catchy song, either.</p>
<p><strong>Black Keys &#8211; <em>Brothers </em></strong>- This band effortlessly blends influences like pop, blues, and Zeppelin into an irresistibly catchy cocktail of awesomeness. The production work of Danger Mouse brings an extra level of ramshackle polish to the whole affair. If you&#8217;re throwing a party, you need to play this record. Loudly.</p>
<p><strong>Sting &#8211; <em>Symphonicity </em>&amp; <em>Live in Berlin</em></strong> &#8211; Following a lengthy tour by the Police, I was surprised to see Sting release yet another retreading of old material rather than a new album. Yet the results are largely pleasing; Sting&#8217;s songs are well-suited for reinterpretation by an orchestra, and the real treats on both the studio and live discs are the various non-album  tracks sprinkled throughout (such as &#8220;The Pirate&#8217;s Bride,&#8221; an old b-side I co-opted as the basis for a quest in EQ2).</p>
<p><strong>Danger Mouse &amp; Sparklehorse &#8211; <em>Dark Night of the Soul</em></strong> &#8211; Danger Mouse makes yet another appearance on my list as one of the principles of the <em>Dark Night of the Soul</em>. The album features a varied lot of vocalists and contributors, including Suzanne Vega, Iggy Pop, Frank Black, and David Lynch. Darkness pervades the disc, and not in name only; the spectre of death hovers over this project, plagued by the deaths of Mark Linkous (Sparklehorse) and Vic Chesnutt. The latter&#8217;s &#8220;Grim Augury&#8221; is  one of the most unsettling performances I&#8217;ve heard in years.</p>
<p><strong>Broken Bells &#8211; <em>Broken Bells</em></strong> &#8211; When I first heard that James Mercer of the Shins was working on a project with Danger Mouse, I was almost frightened by the potential for greatness. The album did not disappoint. Catchy, provocative, and expertly crafted, this album delivers in spades. If you like the Shins, this one is a no-brainer.</p>
<p><strong>Blonde Redhead &#8211; <em>Penny Sparkle</em></strong> &#8211; If asked to describe Blonde Redhead&#8217;s music, I&#8217;d be somewhat at a loss. Take the cool parts of the Sugarcubes and discard their silliness, combine with the soundscapes of the Cocteau Twins, add in a bit of the Cure&#8217;s melancholy, and you have something approaching this band&#8217;s sound&#8211;though I&#8217;ve still done a poor job explaining how it all meshes together. Blonde Redhead has consistently put out some of my favorite albums of the past decade, and though I think <em>Penny Sparkle</em> gets a bit off track midway through, it is nonetheless a wonderful album by a remarkable band.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Gabriel &#8211; <em>Scratch My Back</em></strong> &#8211; It takes years for Gabriel to deliver a new album, so when I heard that his next project was going to be a selection of cover songs, I was more than a bit irritated. Yet much to my surprise, the songs here are every bit as satisfying as his original material. The limitations imposed by Gabriel upon this work&#8211;classical instruments and no drums&#8211;result in a tight yet varied collection. My favorite is the startling reinterpretation of &#8220;Boy in the Bubble,&#8221; which takes the Paul Simon original into an entirely new realm. A fantastic album.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Jones &#8211; <em>Praise &amp; Blame</em> </strong>- Rising to worldwide fame as a 60s crooner, Jones has been best known in the last couple decades for clever covers and campy pop that has been more popular in Europe than in the States. But it would be a huge mistake to dismiss his talent; <em>Praise &amp; Blame</em> is a collection of bare-bones anthems rooted in blues and gospel touching on themes of love, lust, redemption, and damnation. Jones is 70 years old, but the power of his trademark voice has barely diminished&#8211;he puts vocalists a third his age to shame. This may well be a career-best album for this too-overlooked star.</p>
<p><strong>Sun Kil Moon &#8211; <em>Admiral Fell Promises</em></strong> -  I have waited many years for Mark Kozelek to release an album worthy of the potential of Red House Painters&#8217; debut EP, <em>Down Colorful Hill</em>.  Though I&#8217;ve consistently loved Kozelek&#8217;s work across his various  incarnations, I&#8217;ve found them to be inconsistent or slightly flawed.  Finally, this record delivers everything I could hope for, and more. A  heartbreaking, beautiful album that fulfills all promises. It was worth  the wait.</p>
<p><strong>Editors &#8211; <em>In This Light and On This Evening</em></strong> &#8211; There is no question that Editors live in the house that Joy Division built. Though they&#8217;ve had really strong albums before, this latest effort marks a new creative pinnacle for the band. There isn&#8217;t a wasted track to be found here, and the driving, danceable goth/pop anthems really shine. With a style of music well suited to a smokey club, its time that Editors stepped out into the spotlight.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Gotta Have It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gil Scott-Heron &#8211; <em>I&#8217;m New Here</em></strong> &#8211; Gil Scott-Heron is often filed under jazz, but his work combines spoken word with jazz, hip-hop, blues, and even Leonard Cohen-esque folk. The first time I heard <em>I&#8217;m New Here</em>, I was literally left speechless by its openness and raw emotion. Rarely does an artist lay his life so bare for all to see as is the case here; Scott-Heron talks about his life being raised in a &#8220;broken home,&#8221; and redefines the phrase in the most heart-wrenching and heartwarming way. This is a stunning work of art, with a directness and intimacy that&#8217;s truly moving. A masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey Thorn &#8211; <em>Love and Its Opposite</em></strong> &#8211; Best known as the  vocalist for Everything But the Girl, Thorn has explored styles ranging  from folksy pop to sparse electronica. She puts the whole bag of tricks  into her latest effort, with spectacular results. Tracey has never  sounded better, both in vocal quality and the wit and wisdom she brings  to the work. This album is the work of an experienced artists at the top of her game.</p>
<p><strong>Janelle Monae &#8211; <em>The ArchAndroid</em></strong> &#8211; This album has everything. Literally, everything&#8211;it features just about every style of music you can name, from classical to rap to 60s girl band to hip hop to&#8230; well, you get the idea. It&#8217;s in here, along with a concept storyline that pulls together robots and love songs and&#8230; uh, lots of other stuff. If you haven&#8217;t heard of this album, it&#8217;s probably because traditional record labels have no idea how to market such a schizophrenic work of genius. I&#8217;m probably not helping the case by trying to describe it, so let me boil it down for you: Janelle Monae is fantastic in every possible way, and this masterfully crafted album exists on a plane all its own. Buy it. Buy it now.</p>
<p><strong>Tricky &#8211; <em>Mixed Race</em></strong> &#8211; The best of Tricky&#8217;s solo work drips with a sinister sexuality that makes you feel slightly voyeuristic for listening to it, as if you&#8217;re peering into some darkened room where naughty things are happening. That dirty intimacy works masterfully on <em>Mixed Race</em>, winding snake-like rhythms together with pulsingly memorable riffs. This is an album that shamelessly envelops you, and you&#8217;re all too pleased to let it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Massive Attack &#8211; <em>Heligoland </em></strong>- There aren&#8217;t many bands you can cite as being the artist who brought an entire genre of music into the mainstream, but that&#8217;s exactly what Massive Attack did with trip hop. It has been ages since Tricky&#8217;s former colleagues released an album of new material, and the band&#8217;s had a turbulent history over the years. But none of that matters when you listen to <em>Heligoland</em>, a collection of fantastic songs that lure you into their dreamy soundscape. Once again you&#8217;ll hear breathy vocals by a smattering of contributors, but you almost don&#8217;t notice the disparate collection of singers because the tracks are so cohesive. This album completely reaffirms Massive Attack&#8217;s status as the masters of trip hop.</p>
<p><strong>Arcade Fire &#8211; <em>The Suburbs</em></strong> &#8211; Let me put it simply: With <em>The Suburbs</em>, Arcade Fire has delivered the ultimate indie rock record. I don&#8217;t know what more there is to say, and I have to wonder how the band will possibly top it. The songs here are so well crafted, and the production so finely sculpted while keeping its raw edge, that everything just works. I normally wouldn&#8217;t go so far out on a limb without living with the record for a few years, but I honestly think <em>The Suburbs</em> will be looked back upon as one of the classic albums of this genre, standing alongside discs like <em>Doolittle, Nevermind, Slanted &amp; Enchanted</em>, <em>Reckoning, </em>and many other alternative rock masterpieces. Time will tell, but I think it&#8217;s a pretty safe bet. My album of the year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of my favorite bands didn&#8217;t release new records this year, so I&#8217;d have to say I was a bit disappointed with 2009 overall. Still, there were plenty of gems worth purchasing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting how many live albums showed up on my list. I enjoy live albums when bands add something new to the performance over the studio versions, so you can assume that any live discs that made my list have that element in common.</p>
<p>Without further ado, please enjoy my favorites from the past year. Let me know what you think, and please suggest anything you think I might enjoy.<span id="more-569"></span></p>
<p><strong>Like It</strong></p>
<p>Adam Lambert &#8211; <em>For Your Entertainment</em> &#8211; This record is needlessly over-produced&#8211;Lambert&#8217;s vocals are way too strong to be so buried in the mix&#8211;but there is a core of a really strong album here. When it works, it works big, such as on the title track. But we want to hear Adam, not his producers. I look forward to follow-up efforts that feature his vocals rather than somebody behind the mixing board. Biggest surprise: Lambert often sounds more like Richard Marx than Freddie Mercury.</p>
<p>Muse &#8211; <em>Resistance </em>- This is a solid record from a great band. So why don&#8217;t I love it? Because I feel like this is about the fourth time I&#8217;ve heard this album. There has been little to no evolution across the band&#8217;s last several releases, and there is nothing here that stands out and makes me say &#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard them do <em>that </em>before.&#8221; Muse has a reliable formula at serious risk of going stale, so I hope they can inject a bit of freshness into their next effort.</p>
<p>Bad Lieutenant &#8211; <em>Never Cry Another Tear</em> &#8211; What was the last good New Order record you heard? Well, here&#8217;s one for you. Bernard Sumner&#8217;s new project sounds like a reinvigorated version of his last band, focusing on the beat-combo sound with just a hint of the electronic dance grooves that pioneered an entire genre. I generally hate it when bands are named after movies, but in this case the music wins out.</p>
<p>Grizzly Bear &#8211; <em>Veckatimest </em>- This extremely eclectic record is hard to categorize. With moments ranging from avant-jazz to pop to folk and many other influences in between, Grizzly Bear makes a unique concoction that stands out from the crowd. If you&#8217;re looking for something off the beaten path, check these guys out.</p>
<p>Crystal Method &#8211; <em>Divided By Night</em> &#8211; These hard-driving electronic dance numbers never fail to disappoint, though some feel more innovative than others. The band makes good use of guest appearances by Justin Warfield (She Wants Revenge) and Peter Hook (New Order), but some of the other guests don&#8217;t bring as much to the table. Still, a really good record to drive to.</p>
<p>Flight of the Conchords -<em> I Told You I Was Freaky</em> &#8211; It&#8217;s not quite as fresh or engaging as their first album, just as the second (and seemingly final) season of their TV show wasn&#8217;t as consistently strong as their first. But even so, there is plenty of brilliance to justify purchasing this record. My hope is that the band can focus on writing great songs rather than writing songs that have to fit the plot of a TV episode, and that future endeavors allow the duo&#8217;s musical brilliance to shine.</p>
<p>Mark Kozelek &#8211; <em>Lost Verses Live</em> &#8211; Played live in an intimate setting, these Sun Kil Moon and Red House Painters songs take on a new life over the studio versions. Seeing Kozelek live is one of those experiences you don&#8217;t forget, so every opportunity to capture it on record is worth the effort.</p>
<p>Rufus Wainwright &#8211; <em>Milwaukee At Last</em> &#8211; I love the way Rufus can effortlessly move from campy bombast to startling earnestness. While this live album doesn&#8217;t contain all of my Wainwright favorites, it&#8217;s still a worthy record showcasing one of our best modern troubadours.</p>
<p>The Bravery &#8211; <em>Stir The Blood</em> &#8211; Plenty of bands these days are cashing in on the sounds of New Wave and Power Pop, but few do it as consistently well as the Bravery. Even on first listen to this album, my toes were tapping. This might have made it to the Love It category if I had more time with it, but it came out fairly late in the year so I haven&#8217;t had enough listens to justify the higher ranking just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Love It</strong></p>
<p>Sting &#8211; <em>If on a Winter&#8217;s Night&#8230;</em> &#8211; Sting is protesting loudly that this is a <em>winter </em>album, not a <em>Christmas </em>album, and certainly it is more somber than traditional holiday fair. What makes it work is that Sting is savvy enough to inject just the right amount of pop flair and sing-along melodies to keep it grounded. But for the record, I wish he had gone into the studio with the Police instead.</p>
<p>Leonard Cohen -<em> Live in London</em> &#8211; Leonard Cohen has spent the last 40 years teaching a master class on how to write kick-ass songs, and he doesn&#8217;t look to be letting up in his golden years. With a typically amazing band backing him up, Cohen&#8217;s sardonic brilliance shines through. You&#8217;d swear he doesn&#8217;t sound a day over 74.</p>
<p>Phoenix &#8211; <em>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</em> &#8211; You&#8217;ve probably heard some of this band&#8217;s catchy-but-quirky power anthems on various TV commercials and found it impossible to resist humming along. This was definitely one of the best rock records of the year, though I hope for a more consistent brilliance on their follow-up.</p>
<p>David Sylvian &#8211; <em>Manafon </em>- Sylvian is my favorite solo artist, and I love the experimental direction his work has taken as of late. That said, this record is definitely not for everyone. The minimalist music is often discordant and challenging, often more of a noisescape than a melody. Still, there is something about the lyrics that recalls<em> Secrets of the Beehive</em> for me, and I find the new record to be immensely personal and introspective. Those willing to make the journey away from the mascara-laden days of Japan may find the experience of <em>Manafon </em>as rewarding as I do.</p>
<p>Placebo &#8211; <em>Battle For The Sun</em> &#8211; These glam rockers have been putting out solid records since they started, and their latest is no less a sonic feast. Their sexually ambiguous hedonism is a blueprint for the kind of albums Adam Lambert should be making, laden with biting irony and irresistible hooks. The band has never sounded sharper.</p>
<p>Lisa Germano &#8211; <em>Magic Neighbor</em> &#8211; Best known for her violin duties alongside more rock icons than you can name, Lisa Germano has made a career out of releasing haunting solo albums that showcase her diverse musical skills. From breathy vocals to echoing dance beats, Germano once again reminds us how compelling her understated style can be. <em>Magic Neighbor</em> is the soundtrack to a cabaret for lost souls, the audience serving as ghostly observers to an otherworldly dance.</p>
<p>Andrew Bird &#8211; <em>Noble Beast</em> &#8211; Bird has released a number of records across several labels, all of which are worth the trouble of tracking down (or, I guess, downloading). On his latest, Bird once again explores a number of styles and is as likely to remind you of early Talking Heads as he is to recall Radiohead. Something of a chameleon, the real Andrew Bird is in there for those willing to look&#8211;and you&#8217;ll be rewarded for doing so.</p>
<p>Lily Allen &#8211; <em>It&#8217;s Not Me, It&#8217;s You</em> &#8211; What&#8217;s not to love about Lily Allen? She&#8217;s got the cutest British accent you could ever imagine and croons lilting 60s-esque pop full of frank lyrics about sex and relationships. The music is instantly catchy, but it&#8217;s Allen&#8217;s frank ballsiness that sells the experience. A naughty delight.</p>
<p>Iron &amp; Wine &#8211; <em>Around the Wall</em> &#8211; This two-disc collection of rarities from I&amp;W is a fan&#8217;s wet dream. While comprised of many solid songs that measure up well to the band&#8217;s album tracks, the styles have enough range that I find this set lacking cohesion. On paper, the notion of Iron &amp; Wine covering New Order&#8217;s classic &#8220;Love Vigilantes&#8221; seems brilliant, yet I found the effort a bit forced. Still, these are minor quibbles and anyone who enjoys this excellent band shouldn&#8217;t think twice about picking up this collection. Perhaps I find <em>Around the Wall</em> to be overshadowed by the brilliant&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Gotta Have It</strong></p>
<p>Iron &amp; Wine &#8211; <em>Norfolk 06-20-05</em> &#8211; This live set, quietly released in an unassuming sleeve on Record Store Day (if you don&#8217;t know about Record Store Day, shame on you!), showcases the band at its most engaging. While the recording itself is not technically the best quality, the warmth of the performance shines through like a beacon. The eighteen songs crammed onto this CD distill the charm of Sam Beam&#8217;s work down to a single memorable experience that is not to be missed.</p>
<p>Bat for Lashes &#8211; <em>Two Suns</em> &#8211; Cute girl singing catchy songs about knights and sword fights? Awesome! I can&#8217;t tell you what&#8217;s going on in the mind of songwriter Natasha Khan, but I love the unexpected twists and turns of this record. Part Kate Bush, part Cure, all amazing. A deluxe edition was released later in the year, featuring a second disc of live and bonus tracks. Highly recommended, especially for the standout track &#8220;Daniel.&#8221;</p>
<p>St. Vincent &#8211; <em>Actor </em>- Even more of an artsy experiment than the Bat for Lashes album, this disc by the luminescent St. Vincent (singer/songwriter Annie Clark) is evocative and, at the risk of repeating myself, unexpected. But while the Bat for Lashes record stays largely in the realm of the pop song format, <em>Actor </em>constantly keeps you guessing as to what turn will be thrown at you next. This is a close runner-up for my album of the year.</p>
<p>Joe Henry &#8211; <em>Blood from Stars</em> &#8211; If we&#8217;re fortunate, Heaven will turn out to be a shadowy club where the house band plays a steady, thumping groove that encompasses the best of jazz, blues, folk, and pop craftsmanship without falling into any one style. This band will be led by the creaky wail of Joe Henry&#8217;s plaintive vocals, making even the loneliest of souls feel a bond of kinship. <em>Blood from Stars</em> is another brilliant addition to Henry&#8217;s esteemed catalogue, a gem from one of the greatest songwriters of our time. My album of the year.</p>
<p><strong>In Memoriam</strong></p>
<p>On Christmas Day the great Vic Chesnutt passed away in an Athens hospital. Left partially paralyzed by a car accident at age 18, Vic found he could still strum a guitar and released over a dozen albums, two of which were produced by R.E.M.&#8217;s Michael Stipe. A fixture on the Athens scene, Chesnutt&#8217;s heartfelt songs spoke of hope in an era of pessimism. He will be greatly missed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve long ago lost the ego to think that I can tell you what the &#8220;best&#8221; music of any given year is. Music is far too personal a thing for one blogger to tell you what is good and what isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What I can do, however, is list my favorite music of the year. Hopefully what I write will be descriptive enough to encourage you to buy (as in pay cash money for) some of these albums, whether physical or digital copies. I don&#8217;t need to remind you that the music business is in dire straits as it seeks to reinvent itself, and the one thing we don&#8217;t want to see happen is that it becomes economically impossible for great artists to make a living doing what they do best. So please, buy some of this stuff. Albums listed after the break.</p>
<p><span id="more-324"></span></p>
<p><strong>Like It</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nick Cave &#8211; <em>Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!</em> &#8211; It has been a while since Nick Cave did a lot of shouting. Oh, his recent albums have been every bit as menacing as his earlier work, just in generally quieter ways. Lazarus brings back more of the ranting Cave of old, reminding us that nobody does noir rock better.</li>
<li>We Are Scientists &#8211; <em>Brain Thrust Mastery</em> &#8211; If the Killers had released this record, it would have three Top 10 hits on it. The Scientists are quietly making catchy songs laced with memorable pop hooks, and by all rights should be much more widely known on radio.</li>
<li>R.E.M. &#8211; <em>Accelerate </em>-  One of the bands that defined indie rock eventually became barely relevant, but this record does an awful lot to recapture some of their former glory. Probably their most solid effort since <em>Document</em>.  If they can keep making albums that sound this fresh, I say the boys from Athens should keep at it.</li>
<li>John Legend &#8211; <em>Evolver </em>- Not quite as consistent as <em>Once Again</em>, but Legend&#8217;s voice is so smooth and captivating that I&#8217;d pay to hear him sing the phone book. I feel like a couple of otherwise great songs are burdened by some mediocre (and needlessly crude) raps, but the Al Jarreau-esque vocals can redeem just about anything.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Love It</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gnarls Barkley &#8211; <em>The Odd Couple</em> &#8211; This disc didn&#8217;t receive the attention of its predecessor because it lacked as definitive an anthem as &#8220;Crazy,&#8221; but I think it&#8217;s more solid as an album. The songs remain catchy while delving into some fairly dark and personal subject matter, while the production chops of Danger Mouse are as sharp as ever.</li>
<li>Wire &#8211; <em>Object 47</em> &#8211; I discovered Wire during their second major phase, which really got underway with 1987&#8242;s <em>The Ideal Copy</em>. I&#8217;ve since bought nearly every single release by the band and its individual members, which has led down some incredibly obscure and varied paths&#8211;but they have never failed to intrigue me. After going in a more aggro direction with their last full length, 2003&#8242;s <em>Send</em>, I am very pleased that the band has returned to the quirky, complex, yet infection melodies that first drew me to them.</li>
<li>Ray LaMontagne &#8211; <em>Gossip in the Grain</em> &#8211; A moving mixture of folk and soul, this disc has a quiet power that just kind of washes you away. I still think LaMontagne&#8217;s masterpiece is <em>Till the Sun Turns Black</em>, but I can&#8217;t call this record a disappointment by any stretch of the imagination.</li>
<li>Tom Jones &#8211; <em>24 Hours </em>- The beauty of this album is that it doesn&#8217;t try to be kitchy or modern. It&#8217;s just a great Tom Jones record that sounds like it could fit in the 60s, 70s, or today. These are solid songs sung by one of the greatest voices to ever record popular music. Those looking for a campy sendup need not buy, but anyone looking for a testament to Jones&#8217; amazing voice (still more powerful at age 69 than most modern vocalists) will find a lot to like here.</li>
<li>Ryan Adams and the Cardinals &#8211; <em>Cardinology </em>- I must admit that it&#8217;s been a few years since I&#8217;ve found Adams&#8217; work moving or memorable. Though <em>Gold </em>and <em>Rock N Roll</em> are classics full of great songs, recent discs (including those with the Cardinals) just haven&#8217;t taken hold of me. I&#8217;m happy to say that <em>Cardinology</em> breaks the trend with some catchy numbers that I find myself humming hours after I&#8217;ve heard them.</li>
<li>Santogold &#8211; <em>Santogold </em>- At times sounding like a lost Missing Persons album, this clever mix of 80s synthpop with hip-hop and dancehall is infectious to say the least. It&#8217;s sexy new wave that at times reminds me of Peaches, but it&#8217;s much more radio friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gotta Have It</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bon Iver &#8211; <em>For Emma, Forever Ago</em> &#8211; Recorded in a cabin in Wisconsin, this record is about as glaringly intimate as anything you&#8217;ll ever listen to.  It&#8217;s a startling work awash in layered vocals and guitar with nothing to get in the way of its beauty.</li>
<li>Fleet Foxes &#8211; <em>Fleet Foxes</em> &#8211; Somewhere on the continuum between label mates Iron &amp; Wine and Band of Horses is Fleet Foxes. Combining the folksy intimacy of the former with the soaring melodies of the latter, Fleet Foxes adds distinctly layered vocals to great songs. You can almost go into a trance listening to parts of this record.</li>
<li>My Brightest Diamond &#8211; <em>A Thousand Shark&#8217;s Teeth</em> &#8211; If Kate Bush fell asleep listening to Radiohead, this album would spring whole cloth from her brain. Soaring vocals that sound like they could shatter at any moment but somehow never do. Heavy on the piano and strings, this is one of the most moving discs I&#8217;ve heard in a long time.</li>
<li>Amanda Palmer &#8211; <em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer? </em>- This juggernaut of a record is probably my most listened to of the year. A concept album in presentation if not in execution, <em>Who Killed Amanda Palmer?</em> is a series of cautionary tales that mixes Brechtian theatrics with punk&#8217;s immediacy. I can&#8217;t say enough about how brilliant this disc is. Definitely my album of the year.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, I think 2008 was a really great year for music. I was a bit sad that I didn&#8217;t find any dance or goth stuff that made my list, but time and money get in the way of tryng everything I might enjoy. If you have recommendations for other albums I should check out, please send them my way.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first post-high school job was in a record store. And I do mean a <em><strong>record </strong></em>store. Every Sunday I took inventory of our vinyl LPs so that Daryl, our manager, could send the weekly restock order in.</p>
<p>Though over my lifetime I have bought more CDs than albums (heresy!), I love records. I spent over a decade working in record stores, and if I ever win the lottery or strike it rich in this silly games business I will open my own record store and live out my days quite happily.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why <a title="Breathtaking" href="http://gizmodo.com/5038783/worlds-largest-record-collection-is-worth-50-million-no-one-wants-it-for-3-million" target="_blank">the story of Paul Mawhinney</a> makes me sick and sad and wishing like hell I had $3 million and a place to store his incredible collection of vinyl. I mean, this is literally a historic treasure we&#8217;re talking about here. The thought that he can&#8217;t find a buyer for it stuns me beyond belief.</p>
<p>Mawhinney is absolutely right that there is something magical and inspiring about playing a record album. Besides the distinctive sound, it&#8217;s the extra care they require. You have to love an LP for it to survive the years. You have to be tender to it. You have to love it, and Paul has done that time and time again with his collection. You can see it in his face and hear it in his voice. Playing an album is a ritual, and we are a culture in desperate need of rituals.</p>
<p>Somebody somewhere has to step up and buy this collection. Give Paul Mawhinney the money he is due so he can live out his days happy and content, knowing that his life&#8217;s work will be enjoyed and appreciated for all time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d do it in a heartbeat. Or thirty-three and a third of them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thankfully, David Cook won American Idol. After last night&#8217;s all-out performance by Archie, I was resigned to seeing the younger David winning the year. Perhaps Simon&#8217;s harsh comments actually motivated more viewers to come out on behalf of Mr. Cook. In any case, the right man won.</p>
<p>When I saw the finale was going to be two hours long, I had no intention of watching anything except the last 15 minutes. Of course, I ended up watching the whole thing, and it was actually enjoyable. It was nice to see members of the top twelve who hadn&#8217;t been around in a while, and most of the &#8220;star&#8221; appearances were tasteful.</p>
<p>But come on, be honest: Does anyone actually think that Mike Myers movie looks at all funny? The trailers are painful to watch.</p>
<p>That aside, tonight was the culmination of a good season. I&#8217;ll be back next year.</p>
<p>Now the summer season starts with tomorrow night&#8217;s kickoff of So You Think You Can Dance, which is actually one of my favorite reality shows.</p>
<p>Yeah, I watch too much TV. Hope my copy of Age of Conan gets here soon.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So yeah, I watch American Idol. The show is funny at the start of the season, and you end up getting wrapped up in how the contestants do each week. Top 40 isn&#8217;t my thing, but you have to admire the talent of a lot of these people.</p>
<p>That said, the show is just a TV show to me. I haven&#8217;t bought any Kelly Clarkson or Clay Aiken records (honest!), and I pretty much forget who was on previous seasons. But for the first time, there are people on the show this season whose albums I would actually buy: Jason Castro, David Cook, and Brooke White.</p>
<p>Castro has the exact kind of voice and manner I usually buy, so as long as he holds to a singer-songwriter vibe I&#8217;m there. Cook is ready to be a rock star <em>right now</em>, and as long as he doesn&#8217;t get saddled with some 100-year-old producer who tries to drag him into pop hell he should make a great record. And Brooke&#8217;s voice is just startlingly beautiful; she could sing the instruction manual for a cake decorating kit and put tears in your eyes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already bought a few songs via their in-studio iTunes performances: Castro&#8217;s &#8220;Somewhere Over the Rainbow,&#8221; Cook&#8217;s &#8220;Billie Jean&#8221; and &#8220;Eleanor Rigby,&#8221; and Brooke&#8217;s &#8220;Jolene.&#8221; That cross-marketing thing has to be a goldmine for them.</p>
<p>In other TV news, Hell&#8217;s Kitchen continues to be the best thing ever. I try to model my management style after Gordon Ramsay, as Shwayder will attest.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my all-time favorite bands, <a href="http://www.american-music-club.com/" title="I'm sick of drink, so why am I so thirsty?" target="_blank">American Music Club</a>, releases a new album this week called <em>The Golden Age</em>. Haven&#8217;t heard anything from it yet, but I will be in line at the record store to pick it up.</p>
<p>(Yes, you heartless young bastards, I buy CDs. I don&#8217;t buy MP3s unless I have no choice but to do so. I&#8217;m stubborn; bite me.)</p>
<p>Like me, singer Mark Eitzel is a sardonic old man. I find that charming. Unlike me, he&#8217;s a clever songwriter. I&#8217;m also quite certain he can drink me under the table.</p>
<p>The band is known for their meditations on the downtrodden and disenfranchised, but don&#8217;t call them emo. Here&#8217;s a snippet from the AMC site to tell you why.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course there are many reasons why. 1) AMC refutes the label of &#8216;Emo Pioneers&#8217;. For the record they hate Emo and have never been on the soundtrack for any W.B. network show. (yet) 2) Dark music is for people who are healthy enough to take it &#8211; and AMC want to appeal to all people &#8211; including the sick. 3) Mark Eitzel comments: &#8220;What will my neighbors in my retirement community think? How will I charm the nurse that tends to me? I want to fill my mouth with sugar and spit it on everyone when I talk. I want to cover the world with chocolate cake icing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In case you&#8217;re too lazy to follow the link to their site to check them out, I shall use the magic of the internet to embed a gaggle of their songs for you to check out. If you don&#8217;t like them now, wait until your next relationship ends, get really drunk, and give them another go. Trust me on that one.<span id="more-196"></span></p>
<p>Here ya go.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was a snotty record store employee (instead of a snotty game designer), I used to make up lists of what I considered to be the best albums of each year. It&#8217;s one of the things record store people are best at&#8230; like sneering.</p>
<p>These days I don&#8217;t pretend to be the authority on which music is best, but I can at least post some of the records I listened to a lot this year. The following appear in no particular order.<span id="more-174"></span></p>
<p><strong>Iron &amp; Wine &#8211; The Shepherd&#8217;s Dog</strong> &#8211; A bit of a different sound from previous efforts, reminiscent of Not Drowning, Waving. But the core of Sam Beam&#8217;s work remains: great, incredibly moving songs.</p>
<p><strong>PJ Harvey &#8211; White Chalk</strong> &#8211; PJ focuses on piano instead of guitar, but the results are as intense as ever. Still one of the most influential artists in rock.</p>
<p><strong>She Wants Revenge &#8211; This Is Forever</strong> &#8211; Sounds a bit more produced than their debut album, but the gritty sex, drugs, and beats are still there. These are the songs I&#8217;d write if I had halfway decent recording equipment.</p>
<p><strong>The Shins &#8211; Wincing the Night Away</strong> &#8211; Pretty much a perfect pop record. What other band can get you humming along to a tune about losing a limb?</p>
<p><strong>Crowded House &#8211; Time on Earth </strong>- My favorite of their efforts remains <em>Temple of Low Men</em>, but it&#8217;s great to have (most of) the band back.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Henry &#8211; Civilians</strong> &#8211; Madonna&#8217;s brother-in-law never fails to deliver the goods. Like all his records, this one is meant to be listened to in a smoke-filled room with whiskey in hand.</p>
<p><strong>The Crystal Method &#8211; Drive</strong> &#8211; As advertised, a great disc for playing in the car. I know this isn&#8217;t hardcore enough for some techno fans, but these guys know how to back up their beats with catchy melodies.</p>
<p><strong>Blonde Redhead &#8211; 23</strong> &#8211; Simply one of my favorite bands. Offbeat songs that get into your head with two unique vocalists.</p>
<p><strong>Wire &#8211; Read &amp; Burn 03</strong> &#8211; One of the all-time-great bands, constantly reinventing themselves. I&#8217;m happy to say that this EP is more song-oriented than the previous entries in this series. I look forward to more.</p>
<p><strong>Interpol &#8211; Our Love to Admire</strong> &#8211; Took a while to grow on me, but then a lot of good records take time. It&#8217;s worth the investment.</p>
<p><strong>Editors &#8211; An End Has a Start</strong> &#8211; A more accessible version of Interpol, but every bit as solid a record. Narrowly edges out the previous entry for the Ian Curtis award.</p>
<p><strong>Suzanne Vega &#8211; Beauty &amp;  Crimes</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;ve been a fan since her first record (that&#8217;s before &#8220;Luka&#8221;) and have seen her live several times. One show, I swear she looked right into my eyes for most of the show. True story.</p>
<p><strong>Band of Horses  &#8211; Cease to Begin</strong> &#8211; I think this is a stronger record than their previous effort. Something about this whole album is just transcendent. Absolutely moving.</p>
<p><strong>Rufus Wainwright &#8211; Release the Stars</strong> &#8211; One of today&#8217;s greatest cabaret singers, with songs ranging from personal and touching to uproarious and fun. I still need to pick up his Judy Garland record.</p>
<p>I know I could list more, but that&#8217;s what was handy on my &#8220;play these discs a lot&#8221; shelf. If I file the discs away too soon, they get lost in my collection. Ask Shwayder to inventory my CD library sometime.</p>
