<html><head><title>Tuesday News Day</title></head><body><h1>Tuesday News Day</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-05-07</p><BIG>Prancing Enhanced Twofold</BIG><p>Bards on Test server are <a href="http://pub118.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=4194.topic">reporting</a> that they've finally received new drum and lute graphics. There are new animations for the Luclin models, but as of now old models are stuck with faulty animations. Some bards are <a href="http://pub105.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=13803.topic">complaining</a> that the new instruments are too big for their delicate hands, but we think they <a href="http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/keepersoflife60368/images/drum.JPG">look</a> pretty dandy.<p>Bards ask for so little, and their songs are broken half the time, so it's nice of Verant to give the class such a fancy treat. Hopefully they'll also get a pretty new armor with Planes of Power--something that befits their prancing ways.<p><BIG>The Skin Trade</BIG><p>Those dilligent folks at <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/">EQ Traders</a> are hoping that tomorrow's patch brings the huge wave of new recipes that was promised as &quot;real soon now&quot; from Verant. In the meantime, they've found some newer recipes such as <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_brewing.htm">skull ale</a> and other delights.<p>There is also the potential (maybe) for brewed gate potions:<p><B>Meanwhile, Lyssabeth discovered brewed essences using zone-specific fish, and several other members of the community have helped sort out recipes and narrow down trivials. We've discovered brews that correspond to most of the druid port zones, but not all of them. Of course, we still have only guesses as to the eventual function of these essences, but ...</B><p>Shamans of the world, unite against this threat to your alchemy dominance! What's next, porting pottery? Oh, wait, there kind of is already.<p>How anyone derives satisfaction from figuring out new trade skill combinations is completely beyond me, but I'm glad these peeps are around. I have the feeling I'll be chumming up with them regularly when EQ2 rolls around, as I'll need to buy a new set of leather armor every few days when the old one decays.<p><BIG>The Frame Game</BIG><p>Someone is having a bit of fun with <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=1350811501">eBay</a>, it seems. Paladins are chattering about a pretty obvious <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=15468.topic">hoax</a> in which somebody went to great lengths to make an auction that looks like Kreugen of Fires of Heaven is selling his account.<p>While there's no reaction from the paladin in question yet, to say it's unlikely that he'd sell his account in this manner is an understatement. Besides, the paladins noticed several inconsistencies in the item descriptions that indicate some n00b is simply trying to get Kreugen banned. Sorry, lamer, you did a hell of a lot of typing for nothing.<p>While on this subject, I just wanted to point out how funny fake disclaimers like this are:<p><B>The person buying my account, is buying my personal time, that I have spent developing my character, on this account. The person buying my account, is not buying any intellectual property of Verant, Inc. or Sony Interactive. The purpose of this auction is to transact the time I have spent developing my character, to another person so that they may continue to develop and play my character on this account. If you are a member of the Station Network, Verant Inc., Sony Interactive Inc., eBay, or any of their affiliated companies, you are not allowed to purchase this account.</B><p>That's like trying to sell a stolen car and saying &quot;I am not selling the car itself, just the time I spent acquiring it.&quot; Sorry, genius, the law doesn't work that way. But it would be funny if you tried to use that logic with the cops. It would certainly save us all the time spent reading your fake auctions.<p><BIG>A Medly of Stuff We Don't Care Much About</BIG><p>Stormhammer has some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000568.html">scheduled downtime</a>. To make up for this interruption of premium service, players on Legends get their own zone named after them. Lake of Ill Omen will henceforth be known as &quot;Lake of Phatlewtz D'Pharmer&quot;... New Zek and FiVi server rules are <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000562.html">forthcoming</a> and will be posted soonish. Further <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000566.html">discussion</a> of the new rules took place, at which point we got all itchy and had to leave the room... Who is more offensive: <a href="http://espn.go.com/boxing/news/2002/0503/1377497.html">Mike Tyson</a> or <a href="http://www.silverladder.com/literature/humor/canadians/ihate1.htm">Canadians</a>? We at Mobhunter actully find both of them <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/features/featuregen.asp?pid=665">uncool</a> and <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/twotower/">ridiculous</a>. We bet Tyson would beat Canada by knockout in the fourth, however... probably after a bit of groin biting.<p>
