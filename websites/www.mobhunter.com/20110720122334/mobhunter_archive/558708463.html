This should not have changed any of the gameplay functionality of the hate list, with one exception. We've rewritten the functionality of the hate list so that creatures will no longer forget people that they are angry with. There were some cases where characters under some circumstances could evade the hate list and never suffer agro for their actions. That should no longer be possible.</B><p>Not that clarification was really needed, of course. Rangers <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=6f06b079f5fcc2076338dc25e027fc2a&amp;threadid=21307">noticed something had changed</a> right off the bat, with many reports of even standard archery getting them summoned by mobs. Some wizards claimed that <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=25853.topic">critical hits were causing chaos</a> in terms of aggro, and many casters were finding that they had to modify their spell strategy to avoid unwanted attention. Alan provided a <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=25853.topic&amp;start=60&amp;stop=60">further comment<a/>:<p><B>The only gameplay change we intended was the way that the Hate list used to forget people (people doing damage at range). That's it.<p>So you will very likely see changes in the way agro works if you are in a raid-sized group (60+ characters) and you are doing ranged damage. Keep that in mind when looking at what is happening. I'll keep my eyes on the things folks report, and if something else is going on we'll certainly look at it. But keep in mind that there are certainly situations that will, and were meant to change for large numbers of people on the hate list when posting or writing me about what you experience.</B><p>It sounds like the impact isn't just limited to raids, as exp groups are reporting similar issues. The thing to keep in perspective is that the hate list changes have only been live for one day. Players will need time to adapt the way they fight to the new system. The bottom line is that people are now responsible for the damage they do--and this is a very good thing for the game.<p>However, this change makes another nagging issue even more crucial: taunt has to be improved, and I don't mean in a month or two--I mean like <B>now.</B> It is completely fair and reasonable for players to be held accountable for their aggro, but only if the classes that are supposed to be able to help diffuse that aggro have the capability to do so. Right now, they do not, and the hate list change has made this one of the most critical game balance issues currently on the plate.<p>The new hate list code fixes part of the problem. Now it's time to concentrate efforts on the other part. That taunt button needs to be effective, and it needs to happen today.<p><BIG>The Pollen Path</BIG><p>Another major part of the patch was a change to mob pathing. So far the response has been <A HREF="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=38354.topic">mostly positive</A>, and many zones with previously horrendous pathing are very much improved.<p>One group not happy, however, is necros, who report that pathing changes have <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=16515">negatively impacted fear kiting</a> in a lot of situations. Instead of mobs kind of stumbling back and forth as before, they tend to make a beeline away from the caster. Some necros are simply advising that paying more attention to where and when fear kiting is used will take care of most potential problems, but again it comes down to the class adapting its strategies.<p>Of course, other necros may counter that they've had to do far too much &quot;strategy adaptation&quot; throughout the history of EverQuest, and honestly it's hard to argue with that opinion.<p><BIG>How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?</BIG><p>Enchanters are confirming (sorry for no link, ench board is down atm) many of their suspicions about the charm changes. Resist modifications have made pets a bit harder to charm, the spells don't last as long, and exp is obtained at a much slower rate. Some chanters are even advocating a return to grouping--imagine that! Even after the changes, though, soloing with charmed mobs is still a viable option for the class, which was basically the goal all along.<p>Less pleased are (once again) necromancers, who have found that charming undead via their Word of Terris spell is <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=16495">nearly impossible</a>. The reason? Necros can't debuff the MR of mobs like enchanters can, so WoT gets resisted a lot. Soloing in the Crypt of Decay is out the window--at least by means of charmed pets. Again, necros soloing CoD for vast exp gains was one of the key reasons for the changes to charm, but necros really shouldn't lose the ability altogether. Perhaps they need to find the right class to partner with...<p><BIG>Party at the Monastery</BIG><p>Shocking as it may be, the majority of monks are <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=38328.topic">extremely satisfied</a> with the changes made to their mitigation abilities. They're surviving pulls better, able to do a limited amount of tanking, and some can even solo a bit once again. It's almost disconcerting to see so many happy posts on the monk board, but it's a long overdue sight.<p>An unannounced (and unintended) monk change that went live with the patch was <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=55087">mentioned</A> by Alan on Dev Corner:<p><B>We are hearing reports that Feign Death is causing NPCs to always and completely forget about the person using FD.  If this is indeed happening (and we're checking into it now), it was an unintentional change.</B><p>For those who don't remember, this is the way feign death used to work before it was changed a couple years back, and is in fact the way it has always worked on mobs level 32 and lower. As you'd expect, there is some <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=38341.topic">debate</a> about the merits of the new/old feign death. Some monks would like this &quot;mistake&quot; to remain in game, while others point out that it actually makes some pulls harder than before.<p>Personally, I think the 100% mem wipe makes sense for the skill, and actually brings it more in line with its original intent--a means of increasing the user's survivability in a bad situation. This is especially true in light of rogue and bard abilities to remove themselves completely from the hate list of mobs, which the pre-patch feign didn't always do. However, the biggest argument against the mem wipe with FD is that it completely removes accountability for damage done to mobs--which was the point of the whole hate list revamp in the first place. In any case, hopefully the dev team weighs the pros and cons of leaving FD the way it is now before rushing to revert it back to its previous state.<p>What remains unclear is how this change, if unintended, made it to the live servers. Monks have known feign death was behaving this way on Test server for <I>weeks</I> now, and had posted about it repeatedly. Test monks claimed to have <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=38341.topic&amp;start=6&amp;stop=6">filed bug reports and petitions</a> in game, yet the feign change went live anyway. Clearly this one fell through the cracks in a major way, and the team needs to figure out why.<p><BIG>Other Things Found in the Patch...</BIG><p>A couple changes to mob behavior should make melee classes quite happy. First off, a lot of upper-level exp mobs were changed such that they don't enrage anymore. This was a <I>huge</I> DPS killer for melee, because it basically required them to stop attacking and stand there so that they didn't die to ripostes. Secondly, AoE rampage seems to be gone from some (if not all) boss mobs, replaced by a single-target rampage that allows for much greater participation in fights. Suddenly, melee who had to either use ranged attacks or try to hover at the very edge of rampage range can now feel like they're a part of the fight again. Some bosses might need tuning to take the higher player damage output into account, but such changes would be more than worth it if more players feel like they're making a difference.<p>Guilds killing the Emperor in Ssra Temple were upset to find that <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=13077.topic">planar rifts aren't dropping</a> for the Vex Thal key quest. GMs seemed to be caught off guard by the issue and weren't quick to offer assistance, but clearly this is a bug that requires fixing.<p>In &quot;unkillable&quot; mobs news, Jaled Dar's shade in Dragon Necropolis was <A HREF="http://www.drow.org/news.cgi">taken down</A> by the Drow guild. Like many quest mobs, old Jaled had no loot, but he did have a fitting death message. So if you enjoy killing mobs with a jillion hitpoints, there's now a way for you to raise your faction with Trakanon and hang out in his lair. I'm sure he'd welcome the company.<p>As I mentioned yesterday, an update to EQW is now available, so you can <a href="http://www.eqwindows.com/eqw235.zip">download the file</a> and enjoy an alternative windowed mode for EQ that many prefer over the native version. It's also the only way you can currently two-box on a single machine, making it all but a necessity for some players.<p>Keep the comments on the patching coming, either by posting below or by <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">dropping me a line</a> and giving me the 411. <a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3571">Unexpected changes</a> can be interesting.
