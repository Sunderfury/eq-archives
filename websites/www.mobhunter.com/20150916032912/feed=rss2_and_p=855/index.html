		<description><![CDATA[This is good to hear. As a fellow writer myself, I understand the attachment that goes into the work - as what we do is quite a bit different than producing other types of products. Very much like art, we put a lot of ourselves into what we create. Our experiences, our perspective, and even our emotions. Getting that connection severed should definitely be a shock - especially if you were doing it right. (Hint hint, you were!)

It is good to know that EQNext will live on, as a fan of the franchise for one, but also having read the lore and invested my own time, thought, and analysis into it as well. I&#039;m actually very excited to see you blogging (I never knew this thing existed!). It would be a very convenient way to follow your work and career. While I was a bit to busy with life changes (finishing my service in the Marines, getting married, and my first kids being born) to really dive into Amalur - I was keeping a distant eye on it.

Salvatore is one of my favorite writers (though I do think his complex combat choreography is slightly less enjoyable to me than it used to be) and I (still) love his work. Makes a lot of sense why I really enjoyed the Authors you helped select for EQNext lore and the plot and stories you all crafted together. I didn&#039;t know you were on the Amalur project until after I started following you via SOE/EQN.

Best of luck to you sir. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find a new home somewhere on an exciting project. At the very least, maybe I&#039;ll get to play some EQNext with you whenever that project is complete!

Cheers,
