				<p>Yes, I admit it. I’m a slow updater. Back in the old Mobhunter days, I used to crank out at least an article a week, sometimes several if the occasion merited such a feat. But back then I was bluffing my way through fantasy sports, junk mail, or proofreading jobs that didn’t consume so much of my attention. These days I am busy just about all the time. And when I’m not busy, I’m picking on Blackguard, which is a full-time job in and of itself.</p>
<p>So anyway, I’ll try and get better at writing these things, especially since it’s fun to do. Time to fire up some pop culture, baby.<span id="more-8"></span></p>
<p><strong>(Butter)Fly on the Windscreen</strong></p>
<p>Last weekend I drove to Phoenix to visit some of my siblings and their associated families. The drive takes five or six hours, depending on your need for speed and the number of times you need to stop and visit poorly maintained rest areas.</p>
<p>I like drives that last several hours. There is something cathartic about being alone with your thoughts, the music blasting as the road bleeds by. You get time to reflect and think about life in a way that you can’t when you’re scrambling to finish update notes or debating the finer points of raid mobs with Roger Uzun. I know most of you don’t do those exact things on a daily basis, but hopefully you get my meaning.</p>
<p>Springtime in the desert is amazing. Some of you might picture the stretch of highway between the two cities as desolate, but in truth it’s far from it. The desert is alive with color and energy, bursting with flowers in bloom as you pass from the mountains outside San Diego through the dunes near the state line to the saguaro-dotted landscape outside Phoenix.</p>
<p>Early on in the drive I noticed lots of butterflies fluttering along the road. That’s nice, I thought. After all, who doesn’t like butterflies? Especially the monarch, with its spotted wings and bright colors.</p>
<p>Well, I still like butterflies. But I don’t like them so much when I’m going 90 miles and hour and they begin to splatter my windshield and decorate the grill of my vehicle with the remains of their aforementioned wings. Those stately monarchs make huge yellow splotches as they thud against the glass, spackling my view with the trails of their innards. Seriously, I got hit by hundreds of big, juicy butterflies.</p>
<p>So I returned to San Diego on Sunday with an extensive butterfly collection. Trouble is, it’s going to take me several car washes to rid myself of it.</p>
<p><strong>Rock Covers What Again?</strong></p>
<p>Last Thursday, as video game aficionados know, marked the launch of the PSP. The release of any new game or system is like a holiday around our offices. Coders and designers who normally shuffle around muttering about bugs they need to squash or expansion features they need to finish suddenly chatter and giggle like schoolgirls, all excited over the new game they’re about to experience. I saw it happen when Doom 3 and Half-Life 2 came out, as well as when the Nintendo DS launched. But it was an order of magnitude bigger on Thursday.</p>
<p>People were wandering the halls wirelessly battling one another in rounds of golf, car races, and dungeon battles. I think about half the company ate lunch at the food court in the local mall on Thursday so that they could descend upon the EB afterwards. (I was only there for the food… honest!)</p>
<p>As I’ve mentioned before, one of the things that struck me as soon as I took this job was the depth of game knowledge the people in our company have. I thought I was a total geek back in the days of my beloved Atari 2600, but my coworkers have gaming pedigree that puts me to shame. Heck, the guy I share an office with, Steve George, used to own his own video game store where he pestered a frequent shopper named John Smedley into giving him a job. And I think Bruce Ferguson, one of our producers, is so old that he was around when Rock, Paper, Scissors was invented. But I digress.</p>
<p>The cool thing is that I’ll get to observe this phenomenon time and time again, whether it’s Half-Life 3 or Xbox 2 or PS3. I’m very lucky to have a job where people get to have fun and are actually encouraged to embrace that geeky kid that exists deep down in all of us. And even if I’m not the cutting-edge gamer I was back when Coleco was king, at least I can hitch a ride to the food court and soak in some of the magic.</p>
<p>By the time I get around to my next installment of this little ramble fest, the season finale of Battlestar Galactica will have aired, so you can look forward to one of the greatest mysteries of all time: what Moorgard stores on his TiVo. Bet you can’t wait for that one.
