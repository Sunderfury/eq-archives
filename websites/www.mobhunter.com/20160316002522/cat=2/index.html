	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Following a few months of convalescing after the big layoff, I now begin the next phase of my career. I have accepted a position at Blizzard Entertainment working on World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting step for me. Blizzard has a proven track record of shipping quality products, and as a longtime lover of MMOs, it&#8217;s a thrill to go to work on the most successful title my favorite genre has ever seen. It will be a huge honor and challenge to try to make my own mark on the game. An added bonus is reuniting with a bunch of my former 38 colleagues who also work at Blizzard. This is going to be fun!</p>
<p>For reference, the title of this post refers to the big milestones in my career since moving into game development. Phase one was starting at SOE back in 2003. Phase two was helping found 38 Studios in 2006. Phase three was my return to SOE in 2012. Phase four begins now, in May of 2015.</p>
<p>Many folks would be happy to have enjoyed just one of those experiences, so I count myself as very fortunate to be given the opportunity to continue my journey. Thanks for all your support over the last few months, and I hope I can count on it going forward.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I first heard of Kickstarter, the proposition seemed straightforward and awesome. A smaller developer has a great idea and huge passion but can&#8217;t find a publisher willing to front their modest budget, so they fire off a campaign and let the market decide whether it&#8217;s worth backing. The developer has a team in place ready to go, knows the tech required to pull it off, and really only requires the cash. Seems ingenious. And frankly, since that isn&#8217;t the realm of game development I spend my time in, I really didn&#8217;t give it a lot of thought beyond that.</p>
<p>But after some high-profile Kickstarter debacles in which funded projects failed to deliver or required more than their initial ask, crowdfunding has come under increased scrutiny. As it should be&#8211;when you contribute to a campaign, you are an investor, and you shouldn&#8217;t be throwing your money into a black hole. Certainly the stumbles have caused me to rethink my initial perception.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was generally understood all along and I&#8217;m only just now getting it, but clearly Kickstarter is often less about &#8220;Money is the final piece I need to make this game, can I please have some?&#8221; and more about &#8220;We have this awesome idea and need your money to have even a chance of making it.&#8221; Which can be okay, so long as the expectation of funding hope rather than enabling completion is clear up front.</p>
<p>The problem is, it&#8217;s rare to see a campaign present itself that way. For me, a lot of it comes down to the promises being made. If you&#8217;re part of the team that has planned the project out and just needs $500k to make the game, then it is very prudent (and fun) to add stretch goals for what happens if you actually bring in $600k, $700k, and so forth. But if your ask is essentially for seed money to attract the <em>real</em> investors, then that initial crowdfunding goal is about making a vertical slice or demo, and anything beyond that should really only have the stretch goal of, you know, making a deeper, more polished demo. When you look at the perks being offered to higher-level contributors on such projects, you tend to see the same vanity items and feature creep common to just about every campaign.</p>
<p>Again, maybe I&#8217;m just naive for only now realizing this. But if the following point isn&#8217;t clear to you already, I hope you at least take away this one thing from my post: Giving a million bucks in seed money to keep a developer&#8217;s lights on while they seek out the $20+ million they <em>actually</em> need to make their game is <em>orders of magnitude</em> more risky than funding a three-person team that only needs a bit more cash to make it to the finish line. Yes, the world is full of rich investors, but&#8211;trust me on this&#8211;finding the right people willing to invest in making games (especially MMOs) is no easy feat. In the meantime, <strong>your</strong> hard-earned green is feeding those developers. This is high-risk investment, folks. Don&#8217;t do it unless you have  money to lose.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding asks like this can be done responsibly and in a way that frames expectations correctly, but transparency&#8211;especially upfront&#8211;is absolutely crucial. Know what you&#8217;re getting into before you give anyone your money is the foundation of smart business. Seeing a developer with passion is great and something we all want to encourage, but make sure that passion has a clear and achievable plan behind it. Cool ideas are common and cheap; it&#8217;s proper execution that&#8217;s rare and expensive.

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=861" rel="bookmark">The Right Amount of Story</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes people assume that, because I specialize in narrative design, I think every game needs to be saturated with story. But in fact, I look at it from the opposite point of view: What is the minimum amount of story needed for the game being made?</p>
<p>Excess story is a waste of resources and potentially gets in the way of play. Hey, I&#8217;m a gamer too, and I don&#8217;t like clicking through needless dialogue or extraneous cut-scenes any more than you do. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t love well-done dialogue and cut-scenes, because when used correctly, they are powerful tools that can enhance your experience. But I like to focus on finding the most concise path to conveying the most effective story. And often that means doing less, not more.</p>
<p>Of course, some types of games demand a big, sprawling narrative. The <em>Mass Effect</em> series wouldn&#8217;t be what it is without complex dialogue trees and detailed cinematics; they&#8217;re part and parcel of the experience. But <em>Frogger</em> wouldn&#8217;t be any more fun if you understood the protagonist&#8217;s childhood or explored the world&#8217;s political struggles; it&#8217;s enough to know you&#8217;re playing a frog who needs to cross roads and rivers to get home. Building games like <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Landmark</em> are another type that benefits from having a loose narrative at best, allowing the player to imagine as much (or as little) story as they like.</p>
<p>The nature of the sandbox MMO is to eschew formal narrative in favor of free-form play. That doesn&#8217;t mean your world shouldn&#8217;t have a rich and detailed backstory. On the contrary, I&#8217;d argue that sandboxes benefit from deep histories even more than structured narrative games do, because it provides a wealth of story for players to find on their own. Bits of story are embedded in the world awaiting discovery instead of being served up on a quest-journal platter.</p>
<p>But it all comes back to finding the right fit for the game you&#8217;re working on. As much as creating the tale itself, the role of a narrative lead is to pare the story down to its minimalist core. Part of being a memorable storyteller is being a judicious editor.

		<p>At 6pm PST on July 31, 2014, the servers for Vanguard: Saga of Heroes went dark. I wasn&#8217;t on the team that originated the game at Sigil, but I served as its Creative Director for a number of months upon my return to SOE in 2012.</p>
<p>It was a series of unlikely events that led to me working on Vanguard. I&#8217;d just spent the last five-and-a-half years on Copernicus, which was built on fresh tech and the best art assets an MMO had ever seen. After four months on the job hunt, I&#8217;d accepted a design job at a studio focused on console and mobile titles when I got the call inviting me back to SOE.  Though I was looking forward to trying my hand with other types of games, MMOs are my first love, and the idea of reuniting with old friends in San Diego was a big draw. I knew my ultimate destination would be the EQNext team, but I was asked to first help with an attempt to revitalize Vanguard. After weighing my options, I returned to San Diego determined to do my best for a game with one of the most storied histories in the genre.</p>
<p>Working on Vanguard was never easy. It was an aged title by the time I got to it, and although faster PCs allowed it to run better than it had back at its 2007 release, it was still plagued by technical problems resulting from architectural decisions made early on. Its content was a mess, ranging wildly in quality from inventive to abysmal. There were significant bugs everywhere, many of them years old. And while the design tools put a lot of flexibility into developers&#8217; hands, its many idiosyncrasies intersected with a database awash in the detritus of years of half-finished work. Every bug we fixed seemed to come with an unintended side-effect. Change the name of an item and some unrelated field would get zeroed out. Adjust one stat and other variables would be altered without telling you. Lack of version control meant you had to hunt through screen shots or ask players what an item used to be like before it got unintentionally nerfed. There were a lot of days when I would literally sit with my head in my hands, flummoxed at how some feature or another could possibly have been implemented in such a convoluted way.</p>
<p>And yet, I grew to love the game. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=822#more-822" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Into the Sunset: Eulogy and Tribute</span></a>

		<p>Later this week I&#8217;ll be participating in <a title="Sorry, it's sold out" href="https://www.soe.com/soelive/" target="_blank">SOE Live 2013</a> (the event once known as Fan Faire) in lovely Las Vegas. It&#8217;s at Planet Hollywood this year, so it will be interesting to be in a new venue.</p>
<p>This will be the biggest SOE fan gathering in a number of years, no doubt in large part because of the big reveal of EverQuest Next. I&#8217;ve been on the EQN team for a number of months now, contributing to narrative and game design. There&#8217;s a lot of really cool and different things happening, so I&#8217;m excited to see the public&#8217;s reaction.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be participating on two panels: the World of EQN, which is Friday at 5pm, and the Lore of EQN panel on Saturday at 2pm. Be sure to say hello if you&#8217;re attending. Even after the reveal I won&#8217;t be able to answer every question, but we&#8217;ll finally be out of the black box at least.</p>
<p>Buying me drinks won&#8217;t get me to say anything I shouldn&#8217;t&#8230;but you&#8217;re welcome to try!

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After playing some Guild Wars 2 for a while, I finally decided to fire up Mists of Pandaria and see what WoW has been up to. Although I had a higher-level death knight, I decided to yank my good-old level 70 arms warrior from retirement (the undead fellow who still decorates the banner of this site) and see how I fared.</p>
<p>Checking out Pandaria on this guy, of course, required that I play through Lich King and Cataclysm as well. This dampened my enthusiasm, as I&#8217;d already played through a lot of that stuff on my death knight, and I hate repeating content. So I opted for dungeon finder, and found myself having a ball. As the ultimate non-commitment tool, dungeon finder allowed me to sail through XP and gear acquisition without having to repeat the Lich King quests I&#8217;d previously completed. And if I screwed up, it was no big deal&#8211;it wasn&#8217;t like I&#8217;d ever see any of the people I was grouped with again. The Wrath dungeons are a lot of fun, so I enjoyed myself quite a bit, and my warrior was 80 in no time.</p>
<p>Playing through Cataclysm was less fun. The XP curve from 80 to 85 was slower, and I found the dungeons in this expansion far less enjoyable. It&#8217;s not that they were more difficult really; it&#8217;s that the same tricks seemed to be used over and over, as I was endlessly looking for burning spots on the ground to avoid. To pad my XP gains, I ended up playing through the whole underwater zone as well, which I found abysmal (pun intended). I mean, it was fine and all, but the design of the quests felt a little uninspired. The one exception was the naga city where you enter a vision and play through the invasion that had happened there&#8211;I thought that was a cool line with a nice payoff. I was surprised how buggy the content was after all this time, though. Because Blizzard does such a nice job of polishing their work, any problem really stands out. I ran into several places where I had to abandon quests and do them over again because a trigger didn&#8217;t work right or something. Still, all things considered, it was far beyond the level of polish most MMOs attain. I hit 85 and was forced to leave, even though I would have liked to check out Deepholm. I flew around that zone and it looked fantastic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently level 87 in Pandaria, and so far I&#8217;ve been extremely impressed. Both the solo content and the dungeons have been really well done. Cut scenes and cinematics are regularly worked into the content, and the pacing feels very nice. The WoW team has gotten a handle on using phasing to effectively tell stories and show change. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything, but the culmination of the Jade Forest quests was extremely impressive. This zone felt like the best example of storytelling I&#8217;ve seen in any MMO to date&#8211;newer titles included.</p>
<p>At this point, the biggest negative I can point out is that WoW feels burdened by its aging quest mechanics. The whole paradigm of walking into a hub and loading up my quest journal feels so old and dated. I much prefer the GW2 approach of entering an area and being given objectives relevant to what I can see going on around me. Instead of being ordered to kill 10 of this and collect 8 of that, I&#8217;m urged to defend the keep, drive out the centaurs, and other goal-oriented play. It&#8217;s a distinction purely of presentation&#8211;you end up collecting X of this and killing Y of that&#8211;but one method makes the world feel much more alive than the other. The rare moments in WoW when I can forget about the quest journal and just engage with the content are by far my favorites.</p>
<p>Not sure what I&#8217;ll do when I hit the level cap, but for now I&#8217;m very much enjoying my return to Azeroth&#8211;monkey poop and all.

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=797" rel="bookmark">Satisfying Psychological Needs</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I was reading an article called &#8220;<a title="Because we all need psychoanalysis" href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-04-08-the-psychological-appeal-of-violent-shooters" target="_blank">The Psychological Appeal of Violent Shooters</a>&#8221; and thought it had some interesting correlations to MMOs.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In their book, Glued to Games: How Video Games Draw Us In and Hold Us Spellbound, Rigby and Ryan describe &#8220;self-determination theory,&#8221; a fairly well established framework that aims to describe why people pursue certain voluntary activities. In part, self-determination theory says that people are motivated to engage in activities to the extent that they satisfy three psychological needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Competence &#8211; progressing in skill and power.</li>
<li>2. Autonomy &#8211; being able to choose from multiple, meaningful options.</li>
<li>3. Relatedness &#8211; feeling important to others.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The article asserts that most shooters do a pretty good job of meeting these three needs, although studies indicate the games could be just as satisfying without all the blood and headshots. It&#8217;s worth a read.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about how MMOs come at the three needs outlined above.</p>
<p><strong>Competence</strong></p>
<p>One could argue that the entire <a title="Hello, father." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD" target="_blank">DikuMUD</a> style (which was a dominant influence on EverQuest, and therefore most of the MMOs that followed it) is built to satisfy this need: you gain levels or skills, hunt for new and better items, take on increasingly more powerful opponents, <em>ad infinitum</em>. And certainly if you look at early games in the genre, they allowed for the types of emergent gameplay that made players feel skilled and powerful. As an EQ monk called upon to pull in Plane of Fear, Temple of Veeshan, or for raids like the Avatar of War, I felt pride in the skills I possessed which made me better than the average player of my class.</p>
<p>However, one of the frequent complaints about MMOs&#8211;particularly as they age&#8211;is that they&#8217;ve been &#8220;dumbed down&#8221;, made easier for less-skilled players to succeed at. The long list of changes to WoW&#8217;s talent system is an often-cited example of this trend.</p>
<p>We have to admit that MMOs today get mixed marks in this category. Accessibility is a key pillar of most triple-A MMO projects so that the game has the best chance possible of recouping its extravagant budget, and in the process, player competence typically isn&#8217;t a priority target for developers&#8211;even though they often claim that it is. Accessibility is the enemy of player competence.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p>
<p>Using the article&#8217;s definition of this word, MMOs get mixed marks here as well. On the good side, MMOs tend to give players multiple types of content to choose from: leveling up a character solo, doing group dungeons, raiding, crafting, PvP, pet battles, house decorating, dungeon designing, collecting, achievements, and other forms of play are common in MMOs. That&#8217;s a nice variety not present in most other genres.</p>
<p>However, once you delve into each path in detail, it&#8217;s apparent that autonomy isn&#8217;t really present. Most paths in triple-A MMOs, be they narrative-based or achievement-focused, tend to be very linear and without a lot of choice. You might be able to pick which zone you go to at a given level range or which instance you&#8217;ll run, but once that decision is made, you&#8217;re locked in. You can&#8217;t choose how to solve a quest. You can&#8217;t choose the strategy for killing a boss. You can&#8217;t make up your own recipes for making items. You&#8217;re limited to a certain type of housing item or paint color.</p>
<p>MMOs are better at giving you the illusion of autonomy rather than the reality of it. Problems tend to get solved once, and then that becomes the <em>de facto</em> strategy for achieving the desire result (and you get yelled at if you try a different approach). While there are certainly exceptions to this trend, they are few and far between&#8211;at least among triple-A titles.</p>
<p><strong>Relatedness</strong></p>
<p>Importance to others is where MMOs shine. Just about every aspect of MMO gameplay is done better by other genres of games&#8211;shooters are better at fast action, single-player RPGs are better at telling cinematic stories, etc.&#8211;but at least so far, nobody beats MMOs at the social aspects. (Note: This is changing fast! Developers, plan your careers accordingly.)</p>
<p>Skilled players are crucial to a raiding guild. Helpful crafters are the cornerstone of any social guild. Nice people willing to help out someone in trouble allow for those priceless moments of player-to-player interaction that make these games so sticky. Players are the glue that hold MMOs together.</p>
<p>And yet, even MMOs don&#8217;t get a perfect mark here. WoW&#8217;s dungeon finder is the best (worst?) example I can think of. While I have fun jumping easily into content and leaving with shiny new items, all I do is select my role and get pulled into the adventure with a bunch of other players I don&#8217;t know and probably won&#8217;t say a word to unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong. WoW can get away with it because they have so many players and so much to do in the game, yet for smaller titles this would be a terribly depersonalizing experience. Automated matchmaking gets players to the content faster, but ultimately undermine relatedness. When the appeal of the content runs out, players are left with fewer social times to the game itself. This leads to churn, which most MMOs that aren&#8217;t named World of Warcraft are unlikely to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While current MMOs have a lot going for them, in many ways they have strayed from the early principles that actually satisfied competence, autonomy, and relatedness really well. High production values and expensive cut scenes don&#8217;t make up for these losses. The more you try to force an MMO to feel like another type of game, the less it feels like a distinct genre and the farther you get from the core experiences that made MMOs so popular.</p>
<p>It should be noted that most of my observations above are focused on triple-A themepark MMOs. There are certainly smaller, independent projects that are doing a better job of hitting these marks. Ultimately, it may be refocusing on these core principles that returns the MMO genre to its glory days; if not, its best features will likely be absorbed into other genres. Depending how you look at things, this has already happened and will only escalate from here.

		<p>Looks like it&#8217;s been a while since I posted anything that wasn&#8217;t mopey. A rough few months will do that to you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to be able to deliver happier news: I am once again gainfully employed, at the place where my career in games began: Sony Online Entertainment. I lead the design team as Creative Director on Vanguard, which has recently been converted into a free-to-play title.</p>
<p>It was an unexpected turn of events that led me back. Truth be told, I&#8217;d accepted a position at another company in a different state, but an old friend called with an offer I couldn&#8217;t refuse. Though I&#8217;d been away nearly six years, the folks at SOE have made me feel very welcome&#8211;a fantastic feeling.</p>
<p>So, why SOE? And why Vanguard?</p>
<p>Though being part of an epic collapse after years spent working on a large-scale MMO tends to have a negative effect on one&#8217;s psyche, ultimately I love this genre and couldn&#8217;t bear to stay away from it. There&#8217;s simply no challenge in game development like it. And yes, it&#8217;s risky, but when it works it&#8217;s very satisfying. I loved my time at SOE and made many great friends, so being asked back was a true honor.</p>
<p>As for Vanguard, I have a certain personal history with the title. I was community manager on EQ2 while Vanguard was in development, and I heard from a lot of people who told me how the latter was going to stomp all over the former. But despite some initial hard feelings over that flack, I couldn&#8217;t help but root for Vanguard; as an old-school EQ fanboy, it sounded like the type of game I really wanted to play. I was genuinely disappointed at the state of the game at launch and how it dwindled soon after.</p>
<p>But things change. After surviving with almost no development support for years, the conversion to free-to-play has breathed new life into the game&#8211;enough that SOE has made a serious commitment to it. Thus the hiring of folks like me, as well as bringing back some others who&#8217;ve worked on Vanguard in the past. It&#8217;s a lean, dedicated team made up of people who love the game and want to see it live up to its potential. Especially after the events of recent months, that&#8217;s the kind of redemption story I can really get behind.</p>
<p>Working on a live game again feels good, and making my way back to the <a title="My new turf!" href="http://forums.station.sony.com/vg/forums/list.m" target="_blank">forums</a> is exciting too. I&#8217;ve even got FanFaire&#8211;er, <a title="In Vegas, natch." href="http://www.soe.com/soelive/" target="_blank">SOE Live</a> this week!</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to homecomings&#8230; and happier days.
