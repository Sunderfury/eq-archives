Why is it called &quot;Lucy&quot;? I dunno, I just work here. Anyway, Lucy is all about posting new and modified spell data for both the Test and live servers. You can find some pretty interesting stuff just snooping around after a patch.<p>If you tuned in to Lucy today, you got a special treat--a list of Test server spells that looked an awful lot like new stuff for the Planes of Power expansion. More significant than just being new, though, is that some of the spells had level limits up to 65.<p>I'd love to point you to the page that details the spells, but hours later it mysteriously vanished from the Lucy site. Fortunately for us, folks over at the Fires of Heaven board posted <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=793daa51f384b8ed3f54b75187bec4a7&amp;threadid=2822">some of the spells</a>, and later on <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/">Casters Realm</a> put together a list.<p>The notion of whether levels would/should be raised with PoP has been hotly debated pretty much since the expansion was announced. Clearly there has to be progression in the game, and with loot seemingly already surpassing the level where more will equal better, where else is there to go but levels?<p>On the other hand, levelling sucks. It's largely time-consuming exp hunting just like we've done for the past nine months for AA skill points. And what about all the content that was trivialized by raising the limit to 60 with Kunark? Is Verant going to have to put a level limit on the dragons in NToV so that exp groups don't start farming them?<p>Let's just ease back from the panic button for a second. Verant is well aware of the massive balance screwup that resulted from RoK, and it sure seems like they don't want to go through that again. I'm betting they have something up their sleeves to prevent level 65 clerics from duoing the Avatar of War.<p>What are their alternatives? Well, the idea of &quot;planar levels&quot; certainly seems like an option--new levels that only have an effect in the Planes of Power. I'm lukewarm on this idea, as it still involves exping... unless they do something really creative. Like, say, you make it through the third plane and accomplish some quest with an NPC there that requires items from each of the previous planes and boom, you're level 61. Then you fight your way through the next three planes, and boom, 62. So on and so on, until you turn level 65 just before entering the biggest, baddest plane of them all.<p>What is the benefit of a system like this? You avoid mindless experience hunting but still get real advancement--<I>as a guild.</I> You don't have to worry about friends passing you by, because you'd be advancing simultaneously with them. In this case, limiting the benefit of additional levels would be okay, because you'd be gaining them in a different way that doesn't feel like a constant kick in the groin.<p>Is this actually going to happen? Sorry to break it to you, but Verant won't tell me what's going on any more than they'll tell you. So feel free to post your planar advancement ideas, knowing full well--just as I do--that it's too damn late for Verant to do anything about it, even if you had the best idea in the world.<p>Makes you feel almost as powerless as an actual world leader, doesn't it?<p><BIG>Old Bones, New Tricks</BIG><p>Speaking of the old days... remember when necros were the ultimate uberclass? They could solo like machines, had insanely powerful pets, and could /pwn anybody in a duel. If you went into just about any zone in the old world you'd find a necro racking up the exp and loots.<p>Then necros got nerfed. And nerfed. And nerfed. Then they got an epic with a duck's head. Then they got nerfed again.<p>The final straw was the advent of the new skeleton model in Shadows of Luclin. For whatever reason, necros hate it with a passion, and resent the fact that they lost skeletal diversity--the new model has only one color, whereas they used to get that spookier rust-colored pet when they got a bit higher level. Almost more than any other change to their class, necros have been clamoring for more pet options--and have repeatedly been shot down.<p>Turns out somebody on the necro board figured out how to switch back to the pre-Luclin global file and <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=8233">get the old skeletons back</a>... mostly. They're still only one color, and there are some, uh, issues with other models, but most people can get back the original pet and its animations. This has lead necros to call for a switch to be added for their pets just like mages have, giving the option to use the old models or the new ones. It has also lead to the usual &quot;Absor lied to us!&quot; complaints.<p>Hey, I'm all for letting necros pick what they want their pets to look like. Personally, I think the Luclin skeleton model is about ten times cooler than the old one, but that's just me. And being the faithful VAK that I am, I was about to defend Absor and suggest that he probably just reported what he was told... until I uncovered this transcript of a secret conversation between John Smedley, Rich Waters, and Alan. Check this out:<p><B>Smed: Alan, we called you here today to bring you on board with our latest program to get necros to quit.<p>Waters: They've hurt the game long enough, and our only option is to finally force them away. We'll replace their silly looking skeleton pets with more detailed models that look better and use more pixels. It will drive them insane!<p>Absor: That's brilliant, guys! I hate all necromancers so much, and can't wait for them to quit! But won't they just ask for a switch or something so they can keep the old models?<p>Smed: Argh, they've outsmarted us again! Oh, those damned, dirty necros!<p>Waters: Don't panic, Smed. I'll have my whipping boy, Scott Hartsman, come up with some technobabble excuse about how the global file is too full of beastlord pets to include any more skeleton models. In the meantime, Alan, just tell them it can't be done.<p>Absor: You mean... lie to them?<p>Smed: Hell yes! Lie to them! Lie to them all! Mwahahahaha!<p>Waters: Mwahahahahaha!<p>Absor: Mwah... um, okay.</B><p>There you have it--proof positive of Verant's anti-necro conspiracy. When will these villains learn that they can't hide from Mobhunter's powerful lantern of truth?<p>Anyway, use that gimmick to turn on the old skeleton models if you want to, as long as you don't mind seeing wizard familiars as naked humans and shaman pets getting all tiny again. As the necros say, whatever flips your tombstone.<p><BIG>Play Nice Policy--Not</BIG><p>The rules of any MMORPG are designed to make gamers treat each other fairly. Too bad those same rules don't apply to the companies who design the games.<p>The snoops over at the Unknown Player found evidence of a <a href="http://www.unknownplayer.com/archive/02/09/11/1107.php">questionable marketing strategy</a> on the part of Ubi Soft, makers of the much-anticipated (and <a href="http://www.unknownplayer.com/archive/02/09/11/1106.php">long-delayed</a>) Shadowbane. Seems like the Ubi folks were trying to encourage a little mud slinging: <p><B>Now, imagine our surprise when we saw the latest marketing campaign by Ubi Soft for Shadowbane. Alongside the hip logo of &quot;Mercilessly Multiplayer&quot; was a description for a contest where fans could win prizes from Ubi Soft if they just went onto the forums of their competitors and posted articles saying how &quot;Superior&quot; Shadowbane was to all else. To prove you did it, you would have to cut/paste the text of what you wrote and send it to Ubi Soft's marketing department to be entered to win.</B><p>Other people in the industry, such as Mythic's Mark Jacobs, were none too pleased, and Ubi Soft seems to be backing off the idea. Probably a wise move.<p>I mean, you don't see us telling you that <B>all other EQ sites suck and you should only read Mobhunter from now on.</B> We don't play dirty like that.<p><BIG>I Want My PTV</BIG><p>The paladins are restless these days. Since clerics became uber melee soloers, pallys have begun to feel a little unloved. I think it has something to do with their lower cap on the bash skill.<p>A poster over on the Paladins of Norrath board has <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm21.showMessage?topicID=184.topic">expressed his frustration</a> in song. Proving once and for all that paladins are the Weird Als of EverQuest, this little ditty is sung to the tune of &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; by Dire Straits. Here's a snippet:<p><B>Now look at them clerics that's the way you do it<br>You whine like druids on their EZB<br>That ain't workin' that's the way you do it<br>Melee for nothin' and clicks for free<br>Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it<br>Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb<br>Maybe get a blister on your CH finger<br>Maybe get your hammer from Rhag 1<p>We gotta kill real mobs for our weapons<br>Emporer, Seru, NToV<br>We gotta give up spells for our melee<br>We gotta give up melee for our spells</B><p>Please note that if you don't know what &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; sounds like, you're too young to be reading this site. Go look at Beanie Babies or something.<p>Rumor is that druids are composing a song called &quot;Give Us Heals Now&quot; to the tune of the Village People classic &quot;YMCA.&quot; I'm sure you don't want to miss that.
