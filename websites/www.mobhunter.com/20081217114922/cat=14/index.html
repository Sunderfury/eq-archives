				<div class="entry">
					<p>On Thursday I&#8217;m making the cross-country flight to California to attend <a title="As if they need me to pimp this event" href="http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon/?rhtml=y" target="_blank">BlizzCon 2008</a>. A couple of us from 38 Studios will be there in relation to a project called <a href="http://www.azerothadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Azeroth Advisor</a> which you may have <a href="http://www.massively.com/2008/10/03/38-studios-acquires-mmo-newsletter-tailored-to-player-characters/" target="_blank">caught wind about</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be walking the show floor, chatting with gamers and soaking in the sights. And yeah, we&#8217;ll be taking notes so that one day when we have Copernicus fan events, they will be just as exciting as BlizzCon.</p>
<p>Oh, and I want that polar bear!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again: I much prefer fan events over industry gatherings. There is no substitute for meeting players face to face&#8211;even if they&#8217;re not players of a game I&#8217;m working on. So if you see a couple geeks wandering around in 38 Studios gear, be sure to say hello.</p>
<p>Edit: <a title="Wizards. Cyborgs." href="http://www.azerothadvisor.com/public/media" target="_blank">These videos</a> tell you everything you want to know about the Azeroth Advisor newsletter. And more.</p>

					<p><a href="http://eatingbees.brokentoys.org/2008/09/15/what-i-did-for-love/" target="_blank">Sanya is absolutely correct in this post</a>. A big part of being an effective community manager is possessing a genuine love the player base.</p>
<p>This is why, if asked to choose between attending an industry conference or a player-centric event, I&#8217;ll hang with the players every time. During my time on EQ2, there was literally nothing more energizing than attending a Fanfaire and interacting face to face with people passionate about the game. And the best developers on the team always felt the same way.</p>
<p>Love is at the core of community management; love for the players, love for the game, love for the team. Despise any of them and you will burn out and suck at your job.</p>

					<p>Cuppy <a title="She likes the ponies" href="http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=447" target="_blank">posted some thoughts</a> on the <a title="It's WAR, after all" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/09/08/smashmouth/" target="_blank">recent debate</a> concerning whether or not Mythic&#8217;s Mark Jacobs should have posted the response he did to the <a title="Scene of the crime" href="http://onlinegamesareanichemarket.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/oh-what-a-night-late-on-sunday-back-in-008/" target="_blank">EU beta issues on his blog</a>. Her points are correct and reasonable, and I agree with them in spirit just as I do with <a title="Hell yeah!" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/09/08/smashmouth/#comment-38625" target="_blank">Amber&#8217;s rant </a>in the comments section.</p>
<p>However, in many cases the realities of community management are different from the ideals of it. The simple fact is that CEOs and execs get to say what they want whenever they want, and community managers just have to deal with it.</p>
<p>Believe me, it makes any CM crazy when he or she spends hours slaving over the exact wording of a post on a touchy subject only to have an Unstoppable Force leap onto the forums and drop a bomb that stirs up a hornets nest. It&#8217;s especially frustrating when you know that, no matter how well-intentioned the post was, the Unstoppable Force will only be personally engaged with the subject in question until he tires of it, at which point it becomes entirely the community manager&#8217;s mess to clean up.</p>
<p>(You might be assuming that I have found myself in such situations in the past. Perhaps this is true; I refuse to name names. Instead, we&#8217;ll just use hypothetical initials for this fictitious Unstoppable Force. Let&#8217;s randomly choose the initials &#8220;JS.&#8221;)</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s a fellow team member or even a producer who makes a post you wish they wouldn&#8217;t have, you can (and should) call them on it and try to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again. When it&#8217;s someone way up the food chain that does it, you should still call them on it. But be prepared for the fact that, no matter how positively they respond to your feedback, nothing will stop them from doing the same thing again.</p>
<p>This is the reality in this age where it&#8217;s easy for anyone to post their thoughts directly to the player base. Part of the job of the community manager is to remind the Unstoppable Force of the consequences of his posts, even if it doesn&#8217;t seem to do any good at the time. Eventually, you hope, something will sink in.</p>
<p>But the would-be community manager should have no illusions; this WILL happen to you, and you&#8217;re being paid to deal with it. You&#8217;re only in control until someone higher up the food chain swoops in and poops all over your picnic. It is in no small part how you deal with such situations that defines how well you do your job.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;m back in Beantown after taking the red eye from Seattle last night following the conclusion of the <a title="watch for it next year" href="http://www.ionconference.com/" target="_blank">ION Conference</a>. It was a really good show focused on online gaming and MMOs. It was great to meet up with other developers and hear their war stories, as well as talk in person with folks I usually kibitz with through email or blog posts.</p>
<p>One of my favorite bits was a panel looking <a title="Massively had things covered" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/05/15/ion-08-a-five-year-forecast-for-mmos/" target="_blank">five years into the future of MMOs</a>, as discussed by <a title="the Lum speaks" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/05/14/im-old-and-cranky-and-you-should-listen-to-me-about-stuff/" target="_blank">Scott</a> and <a title="A favorite frozen treat" href="http://www.zenofdesign.com/?p=1021" target="_blank">Damion</a> on their blogs. I really want most of what these two guys prophesized to come true, for both personal preference and professional reasons.</p>
<p>Massively also did a <a title="they took more notes than I did" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/05/16/ion-08-taking-an-mmo-community-from-pre-launch-to-live/" target="_blank">lengthy recap of the panel I put together</a>. It was well received by the audience, and I was very pleased with the insightful discussion fostered by my four panelists. I was lucky to get four skilled community managers with a ton of experience and a lot of compelling opinions. My thanks to Craig, Victor, Katie, and Meghan for participating.</p>
<p>The article mentions that I started things off with a rant, which I wrote the night before after attending the MMO 2013 panel and hearing those folks riffing about how little respect community managers get in this industry. So I decided to unleash my inner Moorgard and stir things up a bit to kick off my panel.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t do any slides (h8 u, pwrpoynt) but I am posting the text of my rant for those of you interested. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=225#more-225" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>Just a reminder that next week I&#8217;ll be moderating a panel at the ION Game Conference in Seattle called &#8220;<a title="I'm so damn wordy" href="http://www.ionconference.com/session.php?id=10894" target="_blank">Taking Your Community from Pre-Launch to Live</a>.&#8221; The session is on Thursday, May 15, at 2pm, so swing by and say hello if you happen to be there. I&#8217;ll also be on Jason Roberts&#8217; panel called &#8220;<a title="Dymus is even wordier" href="http://www.ionconference.com/session.php?id=10816" target="_blank">Changing a Live Game: Lessons Learned and Techniques Applied</a>&#8221; in which I will explain how to make people love you while you nerf their classes. That panel is Wednesday, May 14, at 9am (way too early, I know).</p>
<p>Moderating a panel is ideal, because I get to disguise my ineptitude by asking questions of smart people. And if it goes well, I still take all the credit! Muahahahaahaa!!11!! Guess I&#8217;ll just have to fake competence on Dymus&#8217; panel.</p>
<p>Anyway, I will find a way to talk a bit about the importance of community at 38 Studios and all that stuff.</p>

					<p>I had an absolute blast at New York Comic Con. It wasn&#8217;t has hectic as the San Diego version, which made it quite a bit easier to get around while still having a ton of cool stuff to see. There were some great costumes, as well as some really unfortunate ones&#8211;some of which I still see in my nightmares. Hopefully the therapy kicks in soon and I can sleep through the night again.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t been to a fan convention in quite a while, and I&#8217;d forgotten how much I enjoy them. Industry shows are full of people trying to convince you how smart they are or how they have all the answers; fans conventions are full of people who want to have a good time. The thing that energizes me is that these are people who <em>want to believe </em>in something bigger than themselves. They dream of larger-than-life heroes and villains who live in fantastic worlds somehow grander or more perilous than our own. I get such a charge out of being at shows like this, whether the main focus is comics or video games.</p>
<p>As for what I was actually there for, you can watch the <a href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/31233" title="Hint: I'm the obnoxious one." target="_blank">video recap of our panel on 38 Studios&#8217; first year</a>, or read an <a href="http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1905" title="Would have loved a spell check, guys." target="_blank">interview I did with MMORPG.com</a>. Sorry, no sneak peaks at the game just yet, but we did showcase our love of pastries. And really, isn&#8217;t that just as good?</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for the steak, Paul!</p>

					<p>Thought I would let folks know about a couple upcoming appearances by yours truly, in case anyone attending would care to buy me drinks and/or throw stuff at me.</p>
<p>On Sunday, April 20, I&#8217;ll be on a <a href="http://www.nycomiccon.com/app/homepage.cfm?appname=100453&amp;moduleID=2525&amp;LinkID=29982&amp;campaignid=61372448&amp;iUserCampaignID=38274317" title="3pm, I think" target="_blank">panel at NYC Comic Con</a> with several other folks from 38 Studios. No, we won&#8217;t be spilling the beans on Copernicus; the panel, arranged by the good folks at <a href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/" target="_blank">Ten Ton Hammer</a>, focuses on the crazy stuff that goes on during the first year of a new game dev studio&#8217;s existence, and what it&#8217;s like to build an MMO based on the vision of people like R.A. Salvatore and Todd McFarlane.</p>
<p>May 13 to 15, I&#8217;ll be in Seattle for the ION Conference, where I&#8217;ll be <a href="http://www.ionconference.com/speaker.php?id=10868" title="Coast to coast Moorgard!" target="_blank">moderating my own panel and speaking on another</a> that was organized by my design cohort, Jason &#8220;Dymus&#8221; Roberts. My panel focuses on taking a community from pre-launch to a live game, while Jason&#8217;s is about lessons learned from making major changes to a live MMO.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been to either New York City or Seattle, so these should be exciting trips. If you&#8217;re at either or both shows, be sure to swing by and say hello. Just leave the rotten vegetables at home, please.</p>

					<p>Lum <a href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/03/31/why-do-you-gotta-make-me-hurt-you-baby/" title="A fine mess" target="_blank">posted some observations</a> on recent community interaction issues that have beset EQ2. Mr. Jennings asserts several points:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;This is a good example of why, as a game developer, you ideally should never let anyone in an MMO know who you are, ever. And you absolutely shouldn’t let people know that you work on the game they play.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;(And it goes without saying, you shouldn’t then cheat, or send out patch notes a week early on your guild message board, or just simply attract the attention of the appropriate gender in your Ventrilo channel with your el33t access, or anything ethically sleazy like that.)&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;For most developers this isn’t an issue, because, frankly, after working on an MMO for 5 years or so, the absolute last thing they want to do is look at it in their limited free time.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree with the second, but disagree with the other two completely, and posted as much in his comment section. But why should I allow such deep, insightful paragraphs to wallow away on someone else&#8217;s site? So I&#8217;m copying and pasting them here so that I get a unique blog entry out of it. I&#8217;m efficient like that, so read on. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=208#more-208" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>
