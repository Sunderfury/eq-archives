According to Lord, things are coming along swimmingly on the project:<p><B>We have a really good schedule. It's hard to say which point of the project we're at because it's all scheduled out. I can show you where we're at on a particular aspect. But it's going along really well. It feels so good that you're waiting for the other shoe to drop. It's going so great and we're so excited about it, what bad thing is going to happen. Hopefully I won't break my leg tonight.</B><p>Well that sounds great, and... um, what? You have a really good schedule but you don't know what point you're at because the schedule is so good? But shouldn't you... I mean, isn't that what a schedule is for, so you can know where you are on the project?<p>Anyway, the interview doesn't reveal anything groundbreaking about PoP, and we're still excited about the expansion--even if that paragraph is confusing.<p><BIG>Healthier, Happier Pets?</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000621.html">discussed</a> the latest patch to Test server today, which is really long and filled with UI customization info that most of you don't need. Here's a snippet:<p><B>We wanted to first thank those of you that are putting our UI and the Bazaar to the test.<p>We have good/bad news for those of you that have been modifying the UI. The bad news first you say?<p>Today we've made a change that might require you to change your modifications.<p>The good news is that we're adding another level of customization to the UI.<p>We're turning many of the existing displays into labels. This will make it possible for you to put these numbers anywhere you want them on your customized interface. For those of you that aren't worried about modifying the interface, just be aware that we've changed the way the interface deals with things like your character name, class, level, attributes and all that. Please let us know if you see anything odd about any of the numbers or names displayed.</B><p>Okay, big whoop, right? Well, check out this set of labels that you can customize:<p><B>Group Pet 1 Health Pecentage = 40<br>Group Pet 2 Health Pecentage = 41<br>Group Pet 3 Health Pecentage = 42<br>Group Pet 4 Health Pecentage = 43<br>Group Pet 5 Health Pecentage = 44</B><p>It appears that group members will be able to see the health of other members' pets--a handy feature indeed. Hopefully us lame melee types (who can't do anything about it anyway) can toggle the pet health bar off.<p>Absor also mentioned another <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000622.html">scam warning</a> that some poor saps must have fallen for. Alan put his new mantra in big, bold letters, so we will, too: <B>Never give out your password.</B> Really. Don't do it.<p><BIG>Oh, the Humanity!</BIG><p>I've never understood it, really, but rogues just aren't happy unless they have every single racial illusion item available. No matter what race they originally rolled, rogues will guilt trip you into helping them camp in the most godawful places for the chance to become a gnome or an Erudite or whatever.<p>Must be a self-loathing thing. Or maybe they like to <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=852.topic">roleplay</a> every <a href="http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=879.topic">now and then</a>.<p>Rogues can look like most of the playable races through illusion masks, but they've never been able to pull off what Pinnochio and Mr. Data both tried so hard to achieve--to become human. Well, now all it takes is a trip to Vex Thal and your favorite rogue can become <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11526.topic">just that</a>.<p>Instead of a mask, though, the effect is found on a pretty nice helm that is all/all, which troubles a few of those completist rogues. Not only will few of them ever see this item, but they'd have to compete against all other classes for it. Boo hoo.<p>I wonder what would happen if I got the helm and used the effect. Would I keep my appearance or change into some generic brown-haired NPC-looking monk? Only one way to find out...<p><I>Vex Thal, here I come!</I> Well, someday.<p><BIG>War(riors)--Good God, Ya'll--What Are They Good For?</BIG><p>So this innocuous little <a href="http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthetavern.showMessage?topicID=907.topic">discussion</a> started over on the Steel Warrior board talking about how warriors have seen a decrease in power relative to other classes. The great melee balancing of yore used the warrior class as the control group for changing all the others (except rogues), in the process making monks, rangers, paladins, and shadowknights more useful and powerful than they previously were. The thread's author points out some of the current weaknesses of the warrior class:<p>- Lack of reliable taunt, aside from the Area Taunt AA skill<p>- Lack of warrior-only equipment that really enhances the special abilities of the warrior<p>- Powerful weapons given to other classes that are supposed to melee less effectively than a warrior<p>- Magic, melee, and archery crits given to other classes that make warrior damage look like a joke<p>So this thread carries on for a while, with both good and not-so-good points being made, when our old buddy Furor from Fires of Heaven makes a post about how warriors are obsolete (inspiring a <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1854">splinter thread</a> on the FoH board):<p><B>Our class is now valued in effectiveness by the weapons we wield. We cannot mitigate damage better than any other melee class and as a matter of fact monks actually tank better than us - this should scare you... a lot. <p>My guilds top monk has over 4500 hps unbuffed. That is more than 95% of the warriors that play Everquest at level 60, if not more. As a matter of fact, our monks exclusively tank Rampage from Ssra to VT and everything and everywhere in between. We don't tell them to feign, we heal them - it's efficient, easy, and almost foolproof to keep them alive and on the page. <p>What do you do as a warrior in an experience group? If you want to know the truth, the answer is you bring the EXP/min down, whereas almost ANY other class in your spot would bring more exp to the group at a faster pace. <p>To add insult to injury, without any gear we are totally ineffective but on top of that, we need MASSIVE amounts of gear to be partially effective and at the level I play, it's become posturing. <p>Our top monks could tank any mob in this game better than I could with less healing and far greater damage output. The only way I can even be effective versus them is to have hate generating weapons, which were made as a result of my whining about our pathetic lack of taunt pre-Luclin release and then once I have hate, I tank worse than them (thanks @#%$ skill levels and no block skill) and rely on my cleric rotation to keep my 7700 hps flowing - woopedy do.</B><p>Some pretty bold statements there--not that Furor is known as the master of subtlety, of course. But he does bring up some interesting points.<p>Now it's not as if monks are suddenly going to start tanking the Avatar of War or anything. Some mobs simply hit so hard and so fast that a warrior's larger hitpoint pool and the use of the defensive discipline--arguably Verant's greatest blunder in the whole Kunark expansion and the reason class balancing became necessary--are simply mandatory. (If FoH would like to prove me wrong, of course, and supply proof of a monk successfully acting as main tank on an AoW kill, I will happily give pedicures to all of the guild's members.)<p>So on the one hand, Furor is using a pretty extreme example when talking about monks who have 4500 HP unbuffed, because there aren't many of them. But that doesn't take away from the fact that he has some valid concerns. The issue first becomes evident, I think, when you look at NToV gear. The leap a guild makes from going to regular Kunark/Velious equipment to NToV stuff is amazing--suddenly you have monks and rogues with more than 1400AC without even trying, massive hitpoint gains, and incredibly good weapons. Now I'm personally not on the level of Vex Thal gear that those FoH folks are, but let me tell you a little story that actually illustrates Furor's point pretty well.<p>Recently I helped a friend kill some level 55 druid epic mob that you basically need a single group for. Now I'm a monk with some pretty <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=157849">nice gear</a>, though far from the best of the best in game. Our tanks for the fight were supposed to be a level 60 warrior and a level 60 shadowknight from some other guild that had never been to NToV or seen any of the harder Luclin fights. So these two debated over who should be main tank, and I didn't really say anything, though I knew from the weapons they were using that they'd have a hard time taking aggro from me. So we start the fight, and almost right away the mob is on me and stays on me, and we kill it pretty easily. After the battle is over, the SK asks me how many hitpoints I had. My response made both him and the warrior laugh--I had far more HP and AC than either of them.<p>What does that prove? Well, Furor's point does have some validity. If you are putting together an exp group or a small, single group raid, are you going to pick a warrior in average gear or a monk/rogue in really good gear? How about a paladin wielding a 37/30 sword? If you are making the most efficient group possible, the choice is clear.<p>Which brings us to a rather tricky spot. How do you modify warriors in such a way that they can have some uniqueness and do what they do better without trivializing the game?<p>I absolutely believe that if you were to enhance warrior taunt such that a warrior can control aggro at any given moment, then the game is over. Finito. Done. There has to be some challenge to the ubermob fight, and aggro management is the linchpin.<p>Yet here you have the warrior, the class ostensibly designed to be your main tank, that is so utterly reliant on gear and a handful of skills to do its job. In a world where the mana pool of healers is becoming deeper and deeper all the time, thus limiting the need for and effectiveness of a three-minute discipline and a thousand extra hitpoints, what do you do to make them feel needed?<p>I don't know. For all the valid points that warriors raise in these threads, you can go to the rogue or paladin or monk or shadowknight boards and see just as many counterpoints on how those classes pale in comparison to warriors in one way or another. But then, isn't that the point of class balance? That some classes excel at some things while taking a back seat in others?<p>What has to be answered, then, is not whether the warrior should have advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other classes, but whether those advantages and disadvantages are such that the player has a valid and complelling reason to play a warrior (or any other class of their choosing) at any given stage of the game. That is the essence of balance, my friends. And it's what makes the concept--and it's proper execution--so frightfully complicated.
