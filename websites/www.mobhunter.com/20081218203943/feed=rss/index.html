		<title>Itemization Nostalgia</title>
		<description>There's a great thread over at Fires of Heaven asking posters to list their favorite weapons and armor from any MMOG. Not surprisingly, the original EverQuest dominates the list.

Partly this is because the FoH board has its roots firmly in EQ, but there's more to it than that. EverQuest had ...</description>

		<title>The Knight Who Was Death</title>
		<description>Like so many others, I have been lured by the call of the Lich King. After drifting off into AoC and WAR for a while, one appreciates just how polished and solid the act of playing WoW is. That's not to say it's perfect; rather, I mean the fact that ...</description>

		<title>Ensuring More Timely Blog Updates</title>
		<description>I'm as guilty as anyone: bloggers who don't update their sites very often. What a slap in the face to the community!

Well, now there's a solution to ensure that all blog writers get those updates done fast: Write or Die.

Genius! </description>

		<title>Don&#8217;t Be Stupid. Vote.</title>
		<description>I'm not going to tell you who to vote for. Frankly, you shouldn't be looking for political advice on a gaming blog.

But this is an important election, one that will directly shape the future of the next decade. Issues will be decided in the coming years that will affect America's ...</description>

		<title>Playing the Hero</title>
		<description>The BioWare Austin folks are talking a lot about Star Wars: The Old Republic. And they should, because it's without question one of the most anticipated MMOGs on the horizon, thanks in no small part to BioWare's reputation for making quality games.

Besides meditating on the size of one's lightsaber, a ...</description>

		<title>Back on the East Coast</title>
		<description>Wow.

An obvious exclamation to use after returning from BlizzCon, but it fits. This was an amazing event in so many ways. Anyone savvy enough to find this blog doesn't need me to point to the multitude of links recapping the show (Massively alone wrote like a hundred articles), but suffice ...</description>

		<title>Con Artistry in Anaheim</title>
		<description>On Thursday I'm making the cross-country flight to California to attend BlizzCon 2008. A couple of us from 38 Studios will be there in relation to a project called Azeroth Advisor which you may have caught wind about.

We'll be walking the show floor, chatting with gamers and soaking in the ...</description>

		<title>Handy Acronyms</title>
		<description>The blokes at Rock, Paper, Shotgun posted a list of PC gaming acronyms packed with several chuckles. The one that made me laugh out loud was the definition of RPG:
While many games ask you to play a role, the only ones that earn this title are those that ask you ...</description>
