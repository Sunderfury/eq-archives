It would be nice if some of the shows were east coast more often since a huge gaming community exists.</description>

		<description>I was very happy with my Alienware laptop until the fan that cools the graphic card stopped working.  I tried getting a new fan from Alienware, but that model has been discontinued and they no longer have replacement parts.  So now it sits on my desk like a $3000 paperweight while I occasionally and unsuccessfully search through eBay and aftermarket laptop part sites for a new fan.

I&#039;m probably not going to be buying from Alienware again.</description>

		<description>OMG! I went through the exact same sequence of events as you! Even the one day offer for the HP! This is so weird..
Well, the only difference is that i&#039;m sitting on my hands, as its a toss between the M11x or the rumored refresh of the Macbook Pros.
please PLEASE give your thoughts on playing Dragon Age: Origins, currently playing it on my M1730 (Yes 17&quot;, and yes its not a nice companion to take with you through customs, its so big and fat that the supplied tray used for scanning carry-ons can&#039;t fit. It actually scratched the bottom panel, my heart teared a little...) thanks!</description>

		<description>Tom H. - I have not had a single crash with it. Granted, I wouldn&#039;t say I&#039;ve pushed the hardware yet in terms of gaming, but I&#039;ve had quite a few productivity applications open at a single time without issue.

Naladini - The biggest difference I feel as far as screen size is height. I keep most of my applications and games on my larger PC in windowed mode anyway, so running things full screen on the M11x keep the width about the same. But the shorter vertical resolution does take a bit of getting used to.

Scott - The power supply is much smaller and lighter than that of my 17&quot; laptop, but I have not weighed it. I&#039;ll see if I can find data on that.</description>

		<description>Is it reliable? Work bought our entire team M17x with Windows 7 at the start of the year, and I&#039;ve been averaging 1 BSOD per week ever since (including one between drafting and submitting this comment).</description>
