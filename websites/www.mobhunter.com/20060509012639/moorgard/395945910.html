First off, take a gander at the most recent patch message:<p><B>/testbuff - We are adding a new command for use only on the Test server. /testbuff will raise the level of your character to 25 if it was below level 25. It will also provide the character with all appropriate spells as well as a balanced set of items for their class. This will help testers who want to try out a problem with characters of different classes or who are just starting out on the Test server. <p>Spell Descriptions - We are adding a much more informative spell description window to Test today. All of the spell description should be available except for Druid and Beastlord spells, which we will add soon. We will also be adding descriptions for spells available from items in a little while. Please make sure that the spell descriptions appear for all spells but those mentioned above, and please let us know if you have any suggestions or comments about the descriptions.</B><p>That /testbuff command is simply long overdue. There have been many occasions where I've wanted to log onto Test and try out some new feature or zone, but I simply don't have time to level up a character over there. Allowing people to start out at 25 at least lets players test some content without jumping through quite as many hoops as usual.<p>SOE often gets criticized for not making proper use of Test server, and rightfully so. The problem is, right from the start Verant allowed Test to evolve into a real community, so they can't do some things necessary to have a true testing environment. For instance, the player base should be completely wiped out on a regular basis--whenever the current testing cycle is completed. This would allow new features to constantly be tested without fear of players making a permanent home there. Also, the /testbuff command should be variable. If SOE wants a high-level zone like Veksar tested, they wipe all existing characters and set /testbuff so it creates a level 65 character in say NToV-quality gear. Players can log in, play around, and really give the content a run-through with the levels intended for it. Or if SOE decides to introduce a level 30-ish dungeon, /testbuff would create level 30 characters with appropriate equipment. Because the player database would be wiped regularly, they wouldn't have to worry about twinking or people ruining content in other ways. If those level 65 toons wanted to have their way in Befallen, let them--they'll be wiped in a couple weeks anyway.<p>Unfortunately, /testbuff can't be allowed to make level 65 characters now because that would interfere with the community that exists on Test. But it's not too late to change things. SOE could do something like offer free server transfers (with gear) for anyone currently on Test to the server of their choice, or they could move the population en masse whenever they open up another new server. This would allow them to utilize Test server as a true testing environment, which frankly the game desperately needs.<p>As for the spell description thing, that's pretty cool too. It should save AllaKhazam's and Casters Realm some bandwidth, anyway. Now they just need to add the same thing for focus effects so that casters can quit asking &quot;what's that do?&quot; in guildchat every time an item drops.<p><BIG>You Slotty Little Brat</BIG><p>Also on Test right now is a nifty new feature--<a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=39249.topic

">shared bank space</a>. Characters have two new slots in their bank that are shared between all characters on that account. Want to transfer some food and gear to your new alt? Stuff it in a bag, stick it in your shared space, and log in the other character. The goodies will be there waiting for you.<p>Naturally, nodrop items can't be traded this way--sorry folks. But even so, this is an extremely handy feature that a lot of people will like. Even better, it should cut down on petitions claiming that somebody was ripped off during an item transfer. Hey, if nothing else, you're getting two extra bank slots... free of charge this time.<p><BIG>That Our Flag Was Still There</BIG><p>I'll admit it. When I first heard that SOE was intending to remove flag requirements for tier 2 and 3 zones in Planes of Power, I thought to myself, &quot;Well of course. I knew they were going to do that months ago, ever since that day in the shower.&quot; Honestly, all kinds of people assumed that flag restrictions would drop someday on a lot of pre-elemental planes, and it seemed like an entirely reasonable thing to do.<p>But the more feedback I read from players, the more convinced I became that this was a bad idea. No, I'm not talking about complaints from ubers that had put so much effort into flagging their guild and now saw that time as wasted. What really moved me was people in small guilds (like Mobhunter's poster boy, Ximix) who had worked their bottoms off getting their guild keyed for as many zones as they could and felt a real sense of accomplishment for doing so. Even more convincing were complaints from people who don't have a single PoP flag yet that didn't like the idea, because they would never be able to experience the satisfaction of earning the reward of access to new zones.<p>Well, SOE seems to have saved me the trouble of further editorializing on the issue by implementing a <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13581

">slightly different approach</a> currently on Test server. Instead of simply unlocking the zones, tier 2 now has a minimum level of 55 and tier 3 has a minimum level of 62 for entrance. And smartest of all, there is no free flag for Tactics--the zone will remain accessible only through flagging or the key quest.<p>This move is a pretty good compromise, as it still requires people to reach a goal to enter the planes in question, and should keep out players who aren't of the appropriate level for those places. After all, seeing a level 49 person LFG in Halls of Honor isn't good for anyone, really. As for Tactics, we said before that allowing people to run rampant while the Rallos Zek script is executing was a horrible idea, so keeping the place keyed is really a relief for guilds at that level of the game.<p>One last little note concerning Test before we move on: Mages are pleased to see their fire pets are casting a <a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=4461&amp;sid=0c0d735e68f395093cbe6433b935f337">smarter selection of spells</a>. That's right, the little devils now cast Ice Comet, among other things. Grats to the happy pet owners.<p><BIG>Hit It and Quit It</BIG><p><a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=39240.topic

">Monks are disturbed</a> over a post in SOE's Technical Help forum. A poster asked why he still got an <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/042002.html">extended 1018 message</a> after he used /q to exit the game but didn't get it when he disconnected his router. The response:<p><B>Intentionally making yourself go LD will have that effect. I don't suggest trying to make yourself go LD or crash, there is code written into the game that prevents you from loggin right back into the game if you /q, to prevent people from avoiding deaths.<p>Regards,<br>Roger Sewell<br>Sony Online Entertainment</B><p>This came as quite a surprise to monks, since they (and other FD classes) typically use the /q command to ensure that they've cleared aggro after a bad pull--a fairly common practice, since feign doesn't memwipe mobs reliably. Of course, some monks are poo-pooing the whole discussion, saying a good puller doesn't need such a crutch, but trust me, it does come in handy. I remember fondly the time I survived a bad Aary pull in NToV and told my guild it was safe to log clerics back in and begin rezzing. Since the big bad dragon had reset, it was surely safe to stand... uh... oops. Coffins, anyone?<p>(On the plus side, I gained a <I>huge</I> number of RKP [raid kill points] that day. What? You didn't know monks earn points every time they cause a raid wipeout? Well, now maybe you understand the class a bit better.)<p>At any rate, some see /q as an exploit. But, um, it is a command in the game, after all. It certainly shouldn't keep someone out 15 minutes--I doubt it gets used for exploits all that often. Then again, it seems we can just pull the plug and accomplish the same thing.<p><BIG>I'm All Out of Witty Time Puns, So Just Read</BIG><p>It's no secret that uberguilds are having issues in Plane of Time--in fact, Furor seems to have bumped up his retirement early and is transitioning his site into a <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/html/index.php">commercial for World of Warcraft</a> (gotta admit, those screens look sweet). While it's still difficult to assess the content problems without experiencing them personally, we have a better idea about what exactly is going on.<p>Discussions in the <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=37b20dcd9800d521b6443e6a5f87f439&amp;threadid=7169">FoH forums</a> and on the <a href="http://www.townrebels.org/">Township Rebellion site</a> say the same thing. To advance to the next phase, five trials of 18 people each must be completed in a 50-minute window. That's a total of <I>90 people</I> needed for the content, since attempts to recycle players in multiple events was met by <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=740db83d3b0abb492b89ad5d189965a2&amp;threadid=7152">harsh GM intervention</a>. What's more, each of those groups of 18 has to be pretty damn tough in its own right--as in everyone has to be at the absolute top of their game.<p>Granted, players at the endgame should have their shit together, but this demand is a little extreme. Mostly because it's ridiculous to require 90 people when the maximum size of a raid is 72 players. The days of zergfests are supposed to be behind us, remember? Requiring 90 people to do <I>anything</I> in EQ is a horrible decision.<p>Lenardo from Monkly Business seems to have come up with a clever theory as to why this happened. Back when the raid size was 60, maybe the Time trials were created with five teams of 12 players in mind. When the raid size was expanded to 72, the events were retuned to require three groups each, without the designer realizing that it increased the required number of people to 90.<p>Perhaps if only two of the events needed 18 and the other three were tuned for 12, that would be a worthwhile compromise, since it would bring the total to 72. This may even be the way the zone is intended to be done--not being there myself, I can't say for sure. But in any case, if 90 people are actually required to complete the first phase of the zone, then I can't really blame anyone for quitting the game in frustration, because that simply is an unfair demand.<p>We'll be watching the other Time guilds to see if they're making progress. After all, beating the impossible is their business. Sitting around and talking about it is ours--for now, at least.<p>Sunday. Sunday. Someday.
