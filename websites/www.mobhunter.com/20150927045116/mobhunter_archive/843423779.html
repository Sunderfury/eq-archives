If the servers stay up too long, the kobolds in Stonebrunt Mountains gain artificial intelligence and raid NToV in an attempt to spawn Vulak and gain phat l3wtz. Thus, Verant has no choice but to power those suckers down every week or two. Anyway:<p><B>On Thursday, March 7th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 6 hours.<p>- The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>Six hours is a pretty standard window, so don't expect a full caster balancing or anything.<p><BIG>Suggested Mage Spell: Summon Muzzle</BIG><p>Yeesh, talk about long-winded. Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000511.html">answered some questions</a> from the nice folks at the Mage Compendium, and his response turned into <I>Moby Dick.</I><p>Rather than post the whole thing here and run our bandwidth bill into next Thursday, here's a collection of my favorite answers from Absor:<p><B>Yes.<p>Yes, it will. I don't know when.<p>It is now.<p>I don't know.<p>That would be nice. We're looking into it.</B><p>I'm no expert, but it looks like mage problems are solved. Grats mages!<p>Erm, okay, okay. Maybe you want to read what <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=4013.topic">mages have to say about it</a>.<p><BIG>And the Award for Most Insane Paladin Goes to...</BIG><p>Sick... sad... wrong. Those are the words that come to mind when you hear the tale of Iustus, a paladin on Tarew Marr who <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=14693.topic">completed every class ability</a> in his AAXP skills.<p>Actually, old Iustus should be congratulated. That's quite  a feat, even when using multiple bots to PL your main. What he'll do now with all his free time is uncertain, but it has to be more fruitful than spending 9 hours a stretch killing skeletons someplace. It just has to be.<p>By the way, don't ask me to add up how many points that is. Just don't.<p><BIG>The Moss Snake is Awakened</BIG><p>A reader named Eliyas tipped us off to a very important <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/017879.html">thread</a> over on the Newbie Zone board that deals with the ethical implications of killing a notorious beast:<p><B>Lets say you FINALLY make it to North Qeynos and no one is camping the moss snakes. What happens if your guild wakes one up? Will the zone crash? Lets say luck is with them and they keel it. What kinda loot should they expect? Is this a one billion time only event?</B><p>Needless to say, the appropriate response followed:<p><B>Hey dont kill it, that is so irresponsible. I want my ph4t l3wt. If you kill the moss snake then the bats will never, respawn -never. I think it shows a complete lack of respect for others on your server, just because my guild is not able to kill this Mob yet, shouldn't mean we should be denied the potential rewards. You Sux0rs</B><p>It's a good read--thanks, Eliyas!<p>See, just like I promised: short and sweet.<p>Moorgard tired. Moorgard sleep now.
