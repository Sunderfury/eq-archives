		<description><![CDATA[Hey, man.  Good post, and I&#039;m so sorry you&#039;ve taken such a rough hit.  I&#039;m glad you shared it, though.  I started my own company not too long ago and I have a few dozen folks depending on me for  jobs.  There are times I when have a little self-pity-party at the stress of keeping all those people employed and dealing with the drama inherent in any such situation, but reading this helped to remind me why I do it and what it means to them.

But a word of encouragement.  You&#039;re a rock-star and you&#039;re good at what you do.  You won&#039;t be out of work long because quality people of any skill-set are always hard to find and extremely valuable.  The project lives on in the lessons you learned and carry forward, and the friendships you formed.  Pride isn&#039;t something you find through accomplishment, it&#039;s something that you find when reflecting over the scars of your defeats.

Good luck, sir.  I don&#039;t believe you need luck, but my well-wishes are with you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a guy who worked in the games industry for a few years, I&#039;ve experienced *some* of this kind of thing, but every time I read a story like this, I end up scratching my head.

Why do people stay in this industry?  Does any story of employment in the games industry ever end well?  The studio I worked for had numerous layoffs, long period of zero pay and more.  I got off the train before I could get fired and moved to a more stable industry.  Why do you guys keep at it?

If you thought you had a long-term, secure job in this industry, why oh why did you think that?

If it&#039;s just a matter of, &quot;that&#039;s how the games industry is,&quot; then why all the sob stories?  Did you go through life blissfully ignorant with the attitude of, &quot;it won&#039;t happen to me?&quot;  

If you&#039;re resigned to living a life of migrant workers, moving from one studio and title to the next, why do you complain when it happens to you?  

It&#039;s got to be one of the above and I don&#039;t understand any of them.  I do know this: anyone who continually returns to such a horrible business, where good people are used up and spit out when a) the studio runs out of money or b) the project ends, is like Rhianna going back to Chris Brown and deserves no sympathy.

Anyway, I don&#039;t mean to flame anybody, I just don;t understand the mentality of people who stay in this business and would love a better explanation instead of more sob stories when the next golden cow keels over.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can certainly sympathize.  Started a little venture to build a game called Stargate Worlds a number of years ago, only to have my dream hijacked, diverted to pay for all manner of questionable things, mismanaged into the ground, etc., over six VERY painful years, and then &quot;suddenly&quot; go bankrupt on ship day for a lesser product put out in a desperate attempt to keep the dream alive.  

The pain of personal loss and betrayal is very real.  Worse is the pain of seeing so many great people hurt.  The teams that were working so hard to build something special.  The investors eagerly dumping in the cash.  The fans hungry for the game of their dreams.  All of it hurts.

Letting go is the hardest part of a dream, family and wonderful life.  But, it&#039;s the only way to move on to a new dream, new family, new wonderful life.  Difficult times are ahead, as you and others from 38 seek employ.  But you will find it, and find those new families, and new dreams.  I have, and am richer for all of the experience, even the very worst of it.

Though none of this happens by accident, I&#039;ve found seeking payback or recompense for the &quot;on purpose&quot; acts that lead to such disaster never really pans out, and is a waste of time.  Moving on and rebuilding into something better... that&#039;s a much better curative than anything else, anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a former athlete i know what it&#039;s like to put every fiber of your being into something and then have it turn to dust before your very eyes despite your best efforts. I just wanna say how much i think this sucks and how bad I feel for everyone involved ya part of it is the money but ultimately its about the people who become like family. I really hope you land on your feet and just remember as long as you have the desire to make something great its never truly over , best of luck to everyone putting the pieces back together and hopefully moving on to great things down the road.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many of us have been through similar experiences and it never gets any easier.  I hope this one doesn&#039;t prevent you from staying in the industry, but rather empowers you and everyone else who went through it to improve the chances for success next time.  It&#039;s a tough business, but I think it&#039;s worth it.  I hope you do to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What an emotional expression. It may be hard for some people to understand this &quot;loss&quot; you describe as going well beyond just your co-workers, but into the work itself, the art, the concepts, the stories and characters, all unrealized. So sorry all this crapola has gone down for you guys - I&#039;m a gamer and tried to make sense of the stories in the news. What a mess. As an artist, I&#039;ve known a small taste of this loss when I misplaced a valued sketchbook full of ideas, drawings etc and never found it again. You and your kindred will find new dreams to chase and build and you will succeed, maybe not as big as Amalur, but big enough to fire your creative spirit. Hang in there and pick up the pen and pencil and turn to a new fresh page in the book!]]></description>
