Instancing refers to the spawning of multiple versions--or instances--of certain content so that multiple raids can attempt it independently of one another. For example, if an encounter with BossX is instanced, a guild that wants to attempt him can do so without needing sole access to that spawn. Win or lose, another guild can come along and try BossX as well--they'd just get a different instance of the encounter.<p>Sounds nifty and neat, right? This way guilds don't have to fight over spawns--everybody gets a fair shot at the content. And yet, instancing is not without its critics.<p>Why would anyone be against instancing? Well, on some level, EverQuest has always been about competition. As guilds advance through the game, they invariably compete against other guilds for content. Ever since Nagafen and Vox became organized events, guilds have raced each other to control content. In the early days, this lead to many servers having some kind of rotation system. This week guild A gets Fear, next week guild B gets it, and so forth.<p>However, as more and more boss mobs were added to the game, rotations became less and less common. Instead, we began to see more of a stratification of players, as hardcore gamers joined together to form uberguilds that dominated high-end content. Even as early as Kunark, it became much more common to see two or three guilds racing for VS and Trakanon, because it took the most dedicated players on the server to beat them. When Velious arrived with its multiple paths of high-end content, guilds were able to spread out a bit more and competition was lessened for a time. It didn't take long, though, for the most desirable targets to cause competition to heat up again.<p>Just like in real life, competition in EQ can be a positive thing. It has the ability to bring out the best in people, to make them work together and accomplish goals by being the best they can be. Of course, competition can bring out the dark side of people as well, which has lead to much friction and heartache. And with Velious, a new kind of content came along that introduced even more conflict in the game: the bottleneck.<p>Kunark introduced keyed content to EQ, but it was Velious that made it a bottleneck. You had a high-level zone filled with high-demand loot--Sleeper's Tomb--that required a key to enter. The only way you could get a key (initially) was by killing First Brood dragons. Thus, guilds wanting that content had to compete against one another for a handful of spawns in order to gain keys for the zone... one member at a time.<p>Luclin made it even worse. Once again, the reward zone--Vex Thal--was locked, and the bottleneck (aside from a ridiculously long key quest) was the Emperor in Ssra Temple. Although multiple members could complete VT keys with one Emp kill, it was still a one-week spawn that uberguilds tried to monopolize. After all, why share Vex Thal with another guild if you could successfully keep them out of the zone by beating them to Emp every week?<p>Planes of Power brought bottlenecks to a whole new level. Because progression in PoP was tied to killing a series of mobs in a particular order, there are multiple points where one guild can stymie another by preventing the second guild from killing a necessary target. There are also many &quot;blowable spawns,&quot; meaning a boss encounter that is initiated by killing a trigger mob. One guild can keep another from attempting the encounter by killing the trigger and simply letting the timer run out, which prevents the encounter from being attempted again until the trigger is back up--which can take days.<p>So along comes instancing to solve all these problems, right? Well, not everyone thinks so. A lot of people like the competitive aspect of EQ, and argue that instancing dumbs things down too much. They don't want to see EQ become an ubermob-on-demand system where players can order up whatever content they want, when they want it.<p>They have a point. EverQuest is, after all, a <I>massively multiplayer</i> online game. If people want content all to themselves without working for it, there are plenty of single-player adventure games that should suit them. A big part of the appeal of EQ has always been that the people who put in the most time and effort reap the biggest rewards. Uberguilds <I>should</i> have access to content that others don't because the uberguilds have worked harder for it. Without those kind of rewards, players lose their motivation to beat the high-end content, and I suspect a lot of people would lose interest in the game.<p>But instancing isn't about taking challenges away. It does level the playing field a bit, but in a good way. Why? Because too often in EQ, beating content isn't always a matter of skill and dedication, but is simply a matter of who gets to it first.<p>Anyone who has read Mobhunter long enough to remember my editorial on boss spawns and time zones knows that I'm vehemently opposed to one group of players gaining an advantage over another simply based upon where they live in the world. Someone who lives in California and works 9 to 5 everyday might be a more skilled player than someone who lives in New York and works the same hours, but the New York resident is going to have greater access to content simply because he's in an earlier time zone. That's wrong on a lot of levels, but it has the greatest impact when it comes to bottlenecks. If an east coast guild and a west coast guild are equally skilled, the east coast guild will advance faster because it will be able to raid earlier than its counterpart. That isn't competition based on skill or craft--it's based on a clock.<p>Instancing can be a boon in bottleneck situations. If you can beat an encounter, then you can beat the encounter--without having to worry about someone getting to it before you do. Instancing eliminates time zone advantages and brings the focus back to skill and teamwork, where it should be.<p>Don't get me wrong--instancing isn't a cure-all that should be applied to every encounter. In fact, it should be used sparingly and with great care, only in situations that are potential bottlenecks--cockblocks, to use the vernacular--or that are designed around specialized content (something I'll discuss shortly).<p>For example a common opinion right now is that Plane of Time should use instancing. This is because, based upon the design of the zone, it's really meant for one guild to complete as a series of encounters. Allowing more than one guild to access the same content isn't a matter of competition--it invites leapfrogging and spawn stealing. Now of course, the obvious solution is a rotation system, or at the very least an agreement that once one guild initiates the Time encounter then another guild cannot enter. However, instancing the zone would avoid a lot of hard feelings and potential conflicts--and would cut down on customer service issues to boot.<p>There are other PoP encounters that would benefit greatly from instancing. The most obvious are the Rallos Zek script and the elemental gods themselves, all of which are blowable spawns and potential bottlenecks. While having short respawn timers upon failure is a good way to prevent intentional blocking, the fact remains that guilds can still be prevented from progressing simply because another guild logs on earlier than they do. Again, this isn't competition--it's an artificial advantage that shouldn't have the ability to dominate the game.<p>So why not just go back and instance everything? Why not instance the Avatar of War, and Temple of Veeshan, and Lord Seru, and Yelinak, and Sleeper's, and even Inner Acrylia? After all, where once two or three guilds competed for that content on most servers, now you have a dozen or more choking on the same mobs. Their progress is being slowed by the fact that they can't kill enough targets due to the competition, right?<p>As I said, instancing isn't a magic bandage designed to heal all wounds. Stratification based on player skill and guild strength is good for the game, because it allows players to always have goals. You shouldn't be able to walk up to a trigger, stick a quarter in the slot, and spawn an encounter whenever you want so that you can zerg the mob over and over until you win. Most encounters should still encourage competition between guilds because it can be a healthy thing. And as more guilds advance, in general more content should open up all the time.<p>To be effective, instancing must be tightly controlled. Tied to any instanced encounter there must also be a flag/timer system. That is, if a guild attempts a given encounter, they should be prevented from retrying it along standard respawn rules. They shouldn't be able to spawn another instance right away and try again; they should have to wait three days or seven days, or whatever the proper respawn time should be. The whole point of instancing is not that a guild should have unlimited shots at content, but rather that one guild's actions shouldn't impact another guild's ability to try the same fight.<p>Another misconception about instancing is that it would allow too many guilds to reach the same level too quickly. This belief is based on the assumption that all guilds raid the same way and have the same level of skill--which of course is a flawed perspective. Even if, for example, the Emperor in Ssra was an instanced encounter, it doesn't mean that any guild can just waltz up and beat it. In fact, I'd argue that you'd have a very small increase in competition for Vex Thal as a result of it. Although some guilds would get there faster than under the current system, beating the Emp still requires long hours of play, a high degree of skill, and sufficient numbers to pull off the victory. There will always be a finite number of players and guilds who meet those standards, and so access to the reward would still be limited by the same factors it is today.<p>Instancing needn't just be limited to boss mobs, of course. Quests offer another compelling use for this technique. Say you have a scripted event that is designed for a single player or group. With instancing, you can transport the intended number of people into the encounter and introduce content specific to that number of players. No more designing a quest for six people only to have two dozen show up; instancing allows precisely tuned content to reach the intended audience. Some of this was tried in PoP (think the Justice trials and the hedge maze in Nightmare), but with mixed results. Instancing could make quest encounters much more interesting.<p>Let's look to the future and consider instancing in EverQuest 2. Say you have a boss mob encounter that is instanced. Only the new generation of uberguilds can beat the encounter, so instancing in this case still only allows the most skilled players to gain access to that loot. Then a year later, an expansion comes out that raises the level cap. Suddenly you have many more guilds capable of killing the original boss mobs, because now the increase in player power has overcome some of the need for skill. Doesn't instancing mean that uber items will flood the servers too quickly?<p>This is where smart design and clever itemization have to come into play. Expansions should always introduce new, more desirable loot that renders the old stuff obsolete. Guilds taking on the newest level of content shouldn't care at all how many people have access to the older encounters, because the new items should always be more beneficial to them. We can see this in EQ today; no guild in the elemental planes or Time should care how many people raid NToV, because loot in the older zones has been rendered obsolete. In this case, as long as items are designed correctly and risk versus reward is properly maintained, instancing will have no downside to players who continue to put the most time and effort into the game.<p>Casual players can benefit from instanced encounters as well. In EverQuest today, it's hard for a casual guild to organize a Saturday night raid, for example, because there might well be no viable targets up for them to attempt. If a few non-uber encounters are instanced, then a given guild can always know that there will at least be a couple things for them to do regardless of what other guilds have already killed. This would be a huge plus for casual players who often get frustrated today, and such a taste for raiding might in fact whet the appetites of casual players and encourage them to play more frequently.<p>Clearly, instancing needs to be handled carefully in order to work properly for everyone involved. However, when used within the parameters defined above, instancing benefits everyone at all levels of the game. There are potential downsides, but it's becoming very clear that instancing is the future of online gaming. Designers will bear an even greater responsibility to make sure the technique is used to its full potential.
