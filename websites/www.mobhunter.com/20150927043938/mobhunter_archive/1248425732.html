A few posts here and there, sure, but not like it used to be.<p>As if instinctively sensing our craving for mildly interesting news, Alan came through in spades last night, offering up a handful of posts that reminded us of the good old days.<p>First he talked <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52275">more about the AA point refunds</a> that we mentioned in yesterday's update:<p><B>The refund will not remove any prerequisites. So, if after the refund you do not have enough General Ability points to purchase Archetype abilities, you will not be able to purchase those abilities. You'll need to spend enough on General Ability points first. <p>The same applies to abilities like Cannibalization, Gather Mana, and Mind and Body Rejuvenation. If you have these abilities you will need to repurchase Mental Clarity 3 in order to use them. Mental Clarity is only being refunded because it is a requirement for Mana Burn, and those with other abilities that have this as a prerequisite probably should just repurchase Mental Clarity 3...<p>Innate Regeneration is being refunded due to a change we made to that ability a while ago. Innate Regeneration, when it was first introduced, granted two points of regeneration per level in the ability to Trolls and Iksar. We reduced that to one point per level in the ability. We decided to allow those that purchased this ability when it was more powerful for those two races to choose to spend those points elsewhere, if they wish. <p>To be clear, we are refunding Mana Burn because we are changing the ability as described in the recent Development Update. We are refunding Mental Clarity 3 only because it is required to gain Mana Burn. We are refunding Innate Regeneration because of the earlier change made to the way it affects Iksar and Trolls. And we are refunding Quick Summoning because of the changes to the Rods of Mystical Transvergence, also noted in the Development Update. Many mages purchased Quick Summoning exclusively to expedite the use of these Rods, and so we are restoring those points to them to place where they wish. <p>Again, let me remind you that after the patch on October 16th some people will have more than 30 AA points unspent. It is important that you have no more than 30 unspent points on your characters before the patch on the 21st.</B><p>Seems to remove any doubt as to the reasons for these refunds. Next Absor made a post about <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52276">the best place to stick</a>--er, install EQ:<p><B>EverQuest is designed to run out of a directory. The patcher looks for an installation in a directory, and won't recognize the game installation if you have copied the files directly to the root of your drive. <p>The 'root' of your hard drive is the top of all your directories. It's C:, the top level directory, from which all other directories branch down. And, well, it's just not a good idea to store game files (or most other files, for that matter) on the root without good reason. <p>So if you are running EverQuest off of the root of a hard drive (it can be any hard drive, C:, D:, or whatever), you'll need to place the files into a directory on the root drive in order for the game to run.</B><p>Frankly, this one kind of boggles me. Who the hell would install <I>any</I> program in the root directory of a drive? For Pete's sake, EQ (like every other piece of Windows software on the planet) practically <I>begs</I> you to be installed into a nice, orderly directory. Why fight it? Frankly, I can't have much sympathy for anyone who does this.<p>Finally, Absor warned of an upcoming <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52277">change to naked corpse timers</a> that you should probably pay attention to:<p><B>Due to an increasing number of 'corpse spammers', we will be reducing the time that an empty player character corpse will remain in the world. Empty PC corpses will disappear after three real life hours. This starts after the patch on October 16th, so it's a good idea to deal with any resurrections you wish for those corpses before the patch.</B><p>Awwww, you had to go and nerf people's corpse art, didn't you! Anyway, at least they didn't make the timers on naked corpses as short as it used to be. Of course, it seems so long ago that I can't even remember how much time you used to have...<p>Thus ends Absor's posting frenzy. Don't worry, VanFans; I'm sure he'll be back in force once PoP comes out.<p><BIG>I Can Name That God in Two Notes!</BIG><p>So Verant came up with this idea to promote Planes of Power where they send all the different EQ sites pictures of one god each day this week and supply a clue as to its identity, then you get to guess the name of the mystery god. No, you don't win any prize for correctly doing so, since anyone who knows how pictures in a Web browser work will figure it out anyway. The only one who gets a prize is Kohath, who wins a bigger bandwidth bill.<p>Since we're lazy and don't create a separate story for every freaking little news tidbit that comes along, we're combing the gods of Monday and Tuesday into one package. Anyway, here are the clues, and just click on the thumbnails to see the big pics:<p><TABLE border="0" cellpadding="2"><TR><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Terris_Thule_01.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Terris_Thule_01s.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Terris_Thule_02.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Terris_Thule_02s.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Terris_Thule_04.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Terris_Thule_04s.jpg"></a></TD></TR></TABLE><p><I>&quot;I haunt the innocent as they rest.&quot;</I><p><TABLE border="0" cellpadding="2"><TR><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Mith_Marr_02.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Mith_Marr_02s.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Mith_Marr_03.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Mith_Marr_03s.jpg"></a></TD><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Mith_Marr_04.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/images/pop/Mith_Marr_04s.jpg"></a></TD></TR></TABLE><p><I>&quot;I bear ultimate truths throughout the world of Norrath.&quot;</I><p>Now <I>that's</I> what a paladin should look like!<p>While the concept may be a bit cheesy, we'll take any opportunity we can to look at new PoP screenshots. So shut up, already.<p><BIG>Humble Pie</BIG><p>The folks over at HomeLan scored an <a href="http://www.homelanfed.com/index.php?id=9671">interview with Rod Humble</a> in which the Verant bigwig discusses Planes of Power and other delights. There's nothing much of note, really... same old stuff we hear in most such interviews. Certainly nothing worthy of a <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/images/screenshots/october_02/10_14/q-vene_quote.png">quote of the day</a> or anything.<p>Rod again mentions how competition has only helped grow EQ's playerbase. This is sort of interesting in light of Mythic's recent <a href="http://www.mythicentertainment.com/press/oneyear.html">announcement</a> that 500,000 people have played Dark Age of Camelot. Mind you, only 200,000 still subscribe to it, but that's beside the point! In other Camelot news, there's some expansion for DAoC coming out that apparently adds Vah'Shir and Iksar as playable races or something. Then again, I could be wrong--I don't keep up on that stuff.<p><BIG>And in Case You Weren't Sick of It Already...</BIG><p>This coming Friday, CBS's news program <I>48 Hours</I> will be looking into the case of the Wisconsin EQ player who shot himself. I dread seeing it; hopefully the program conflicts with something else I watch so I won't have to catch it. Maybe afterwards I'll check the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/48hours/main3410.shtml">48 Hours Web site</a> for their fair, unbiased summary.<p>Yeah, right.<p>I guess CBS was filming at the most recent FanFaire, so expect shots of sweaty overweight guys with pictures of dragons on their t-shirts. The real question is this: Why didn't CBS ask to interview me? I'm a star, damn it!<p>[insert sound of crickets]<p>Errmmm, anyway, watch it if you want to. I have more important things to do.<p>/em crosses another day off his countdown to PoP calendar
