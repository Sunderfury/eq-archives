Bored with the outlaw lifestyle of the Zeks? Is the wild and wacky ruleset on Sullon too tame for your tastes?<p>Well, there's hope for you. Verant may (or may not--it's so, so hard to say) have some new servers in the works that should satisfy your craving for something completely different.<p>Here's a look at some of these servers and what they have to offer you, the rabid EQ junkie.<p><B>The Uberguild Server</B> - These are actually made to order. You and your fellow uberguild members can pay $50 each per month to have your own personal EverQuest server. That's right, folks--you and your l33t forces will have your own server, complete with uncontested mobs that SPAWN ON DEMAND! This super service will allow you to farm gear to your heart's content. And, since having the best equipment means nothing without loads of admirers to gawk at you, Verant staff members will play level 1 n00bs who will, at your discretion, come up and inspect you and tell you how much you /own every other guild. For an extra $250/month, Verant will provide a rival guild who will fail to kill mobs before you beat them, allowing you to take screenshots of these failed attempts so that you can mock the rival guild and make yourselves feel even more special.<p><B>The Nerfomancer Server</B> - When you log on to this server to create a character, you'll find that your only option is to make a level 60 necromancer. The very best gear--plus your duck stick--will be provided. However, players may abandon this server when they find that the only zones they can access are on Velious, and that there is no one else around for them to feed mana to. Expect to see lots of feign death and twitching, along with a lot of bored liche pets.<p><B>The Pharm Server</B> - Players may be taken aback to find that they can only create druids on this new server, but will be pleased to know that all zones will be considered to be outdoors. Refusal to quad-kite will be a banable offense, and all players are expected to spend at least 50% of their playtime auctioning items in Greater Faydark. Through a special arrangement with <a href="http://www.eqprices.com/">EQ Prices</a>, an item ticker will appear at the bottom of your inventory window that will scroll the current maximum prices you should be asking for your l3wtz. Failure to ask at least 20% higher than these prices will result in a warning being placed on your account.<p><B>The Socialist Server</B> - In an effort to provide an environment where players are truly equal, this server has an interesting twist: no one can advance a level until everyone else on the server has enough exp to advance as well. Any excess experience points earned will go into a &quot;community chest&quot; that will be distributed among your less-fortunate comrades who don't earn exp as fast as you do. When you finally reach level 60, you can be proud that the entire state--er, I mean server--has worked together to achieve this noble goal. On the downside, the only thing to drink will be vodka, and loaves of bread will cost 5,250pp.<p><B>The No-Class-Envy Server</B> - As a means to curb the &quot;my class sucks so much worse than yours&quot; syndrome, this new server will have no classes and will feature a single playable race. Characters will have full access to the weapons and fighting techniques of every class. All spells will be usable by any player. Teleportation will be trivial, so your plate-wearing tank/mage will have no trouble seeing the world. Harmony between the players is virtually assured. (Waitaminute, my bad. This server already <a href="http://www.uo.com/visitor/">exists</a>. Pardon the intrusion.)<p>Have you heard about any more upcoming servers not mentioned here?
