		<description><![CDATA[I worked directly under Steve, and Curt also demonstrated personally to me that he is a caring and passionate leader. Realistically, we should have had major layoffs months before this event. And legally, the company was obligated to warn the staff ahead of time. It&#039;s almost unfathomable how poorly 38 Studios&#039; demise was handled by whoever had insight into the financial situation.

I don&#039;t know who screwed up or not besides Curt, and I don&#039;t want to play that game. We just don&#039;t know exactly what happened. It was a great job while it lasted, but it&#039;s going to take years for some of us to recover financially and shift our careers. If we had played to get on base instead of swinging for the fences, we wouldn&#039;t have struck out.]]></description>
