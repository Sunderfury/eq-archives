Somehow, between the time PoP was in beta and the time it went live, this new feature stopped working properly. Thanks are in order to both the Shaman community and our testing department for feedback, /bugs, and following it through. <p>(Time for my monthly pitch: /bugs really do get read. The more objective details the better. There are quite a few of us who have them mailed to us every day, because we want to keep in touch with what matters to people outside of our own groups of friends.) <p>One thing that I would like to explain -- It's definitely not intended to be a &quot;slow cap&quot; when it's working properly. The best slow still has the largest effect. <p>Nothing here was intended to change the relative balance between the slowing classes. In other words, even on slow-mitigated NPCs, a Shaman using his best Slow will have the most impact. It's just a matter of how much of a given spell takes effect. <p>That said, it's absolutely logical for slowing classes to feel that this aspect of their class' balance had been altered vs certain NPCs in the world. <p>In some respects, that might be true. However, this was implemented as an alternative to the option that designers faced before, which was making certain NPC's unslowable entirely. We like to think that this offers a much better alternative to the absolute of &quot;Don't bother casting this spell at all.&quot; <p>The spells will still help, and once the feature is fixed, they will once again return to having a measurable and useful impact. <p>What it comes down to is this: There are some NPCs where we would prefer that slowing be a &quot;good&quot; thing for a group to have, but not powered to the point of completely wimping a given NPC. <p>It's another way to add flavor to the game, without removing an ability entirely by adding considerably more harsh immunities. <p>Separately, I also agree that there should be some type of message indicating when these spells don't have the generally expected effect -- That's something that we really should have gotten in there, and we'll do that. <p>The feeling of casting a spell and not getting any type of feedback at all really isn't a great one. </B><p>Shamans are pleased to finally get some confirmation on the problem, and to know exactly how Verant intends for things to work. For now, shamans might want to try landing lower-level slows on mobs so that they can at least be slowed a bit.<p>The implementation of a cap on slows is a fine idea--or will be, once it works right. There are lots of boss mobs in PoP with low hitpoints that would be utterly trivialized by slowing them 75%. Limiting the effectiveness of slows while still maintaining the balance between classes that can pull the trick off allows for content to be varied and more fun. Now just get it working!<p><BIG>Patchy-Cake, Patchy-Cake, Baker's Man</BIG><p>Verant snuck an unexpected patch onto us the other night:<p><B>November 4, 2002  3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>- Monk fists as hand-to-hand weapons now scale to 15 damage/20 delay at level 65.<p>- Corrected a bug with a few spells that were group or ranged but would only work on the caster.<p>- Corrected faction issues with some form changes (illusions).<p>- Fixed the Magic and Stealth manual quests in Plane of Knowledge.<p>- Changed how Force Shield, Barrier of Force and Manaskin interact with Beastlord mana regeneration spells.</B><p>Nothing too major, at least on the surface. Some welcome bug fixes, and of course the change to monk fists continues to be the biggest non-issue going right now.<p><BIG>Levels Are Overrated Anyway</BIG><p>We've been getting a fair amount of mail lately from people who have encountered an experience loss since PoP came out. These folks were making steady progress to 65, only to log in at some random time to find themselve back in level 60 (or worse). Verant knows about the bug, and Absor <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52556">provided a way to detect it</a> before it causes damage:<p><B>There is a rare but nasty bug in our system right now. We're working on a fix for it now, but it is important that you know about it until we can get it fixed. <p>There is a rare problem that can cause people to not be credited with all of the expansions that they own. This may cause you to be unable to access a character in an expansion zone. If it believes you are missing Planes of Power you will not be able to gain experience past level 60, or past level 50 if you are missing all expansions. This may cause a loss of experience for some characters in rare instances. <p>Please double check to make sure that you have the correct expansions listed when you log in. <p>If you do not, return to the login screen and try logging in again (and again check to make sure you have all appropriate expansions listed). Logging back into the server should restore your access to the expansions, but make certain to check. <p>For those people who have been affected by this bug -please /petition or use the <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/">Contact Your GM link</A> so we can restore your character.</B><p>Having the bug fixed would be better, but a way to avoid it is something, anyway.<p><BIG>Who's Afraid of the Big Blue Wolf?</BIG><p>Once in a while, graphics in EQ tend to wig out for no apparent reason. You might recall that after a recent patch, Shadowhaven had pictures of lutes on the walls for a lot of people. Well even after that was cleared up, some folks started seeing wolves and beastlord pets with blue bodies and pink heads and stuff. Absor gives <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52587">an explanation</a> and provides the solution:<p><B>If you are seeing odd looking wolves it could be related to your texture cache. If you are seeing the odd wolves and have texture cache turned on, then you should delete all of the *.txc files in you EverQuest directory. This should return your wolves to normal.</B><p>Doing this will make your loading times longer initially, since EQ will be building new texture cache files for you. Once that's done, though, it will be bye-bye to blue wolves. If you find you miss them, just see your local shroom dealer and you'll be back in business.<p><BIG>You CAN Take It with You</BIG><p>In one of those rather shocking little announcements Verant has been sneaking on us as of late, the company announced <a href="http://eqpocket.station.sony.com/">EQ for the Pocket PC</a>.  Now of course this isn't the online version we all know and mostly love, but rather a single-player title with three installments.<p>So no, you can't farm exp while typing away on your Pocket PC. But you can look at naked elves, and that's the next best thing.<p><BIG>Touch Me in the Morning</BIG><p>The free trial download of <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/eqim.jsp">EQIM</a> is now available, allowing you to reach out and touch fellow players without having to log in to the game.<p>Seems to be working pretty well so far. I was getting tells in game from several people, including an old friend messaging me from his backup PC because his EQ comp recently died. For situations like this, EQIM could be very handy.<p>There is no announcement yet on pricing. Personally, I still think this program should be free. After all, it's practically guaranteed to draw people into the game even more. Folks sitting at work and hearing what their guild is up to will want to log in as soon as they get home. Why would Verant want to charge for something that's going to keep people playing?<p>Besides, I still don't see how they'd be able to make much cash on this thing, since people get most of the functionality through message boards and other instant messenger programs anyway. Better to look at this as an investment in keeping players interested than as a way to make a tiny bit of extra cash. It will be worth more to them in the long run to keep it free.<p><BIG>Living in Harmony</BIG><p>In another recent visit to a class board, Scott Hartsman let bards know some of the <a href="http://pub105.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=15671.topic">details</a> on the effect that charisma has on lull and harmony spells:<p><B>We don't usually get too far into specifics in favor of people discovering the usefulness themselves. <p>Unfortunately, with an ability as subtle as this one, Charisma's impact is hard to discover, and would likely continue on into the annals of EQ history as &quot;useless.&quot;<p>That said -- On the Lull/Harmony series, which has recently been rewritten, there are two checks, as I imagine most everyone knows already. <p>1) Is the effect resisted? (what this parse shows)<br>2) If the effect *is* resisted, will the NPC get angry and tell its friends that it's time for a BardSnack(tm), or will it ignore what just happened?<p>Charisma is the sole determinant in the second check. It doesn't affect the first.<p>As for the in-game justification: If it likes you enough, it might find itself compelled to forgive you for trying to pull a fast one on it.</B><p>I'm sure fans of the harmony line will find that useful. But me, I didn't really need to know. I can lull people to sleep via news articles just fine, even with my relatively low charisma.<p>By the way, if anyone catches the pop-culture reference of this newsbit's title, you'll make me a very happy person.
