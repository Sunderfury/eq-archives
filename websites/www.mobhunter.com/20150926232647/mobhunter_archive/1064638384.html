Data seems to be indicating that the Spell Casting Mastery 3 AA skill isn't working as advertised. SCM3 is supposed to increase the caster's chance to use their specialization, resulting in less fizzles and a shot at a lower mana cost.<p>There are some <a href="http://seq.sourceforge.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1958">hard numbers</a> over on that evil ShowEQ site, but you can check out the opinions of <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=12188">clerics</a>, <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=28907.topic">druids</a>, and <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=21109.topic">wizards</a> for further evidence.<p>Granted, sometimes the natural reaction after any patch is to think that some skill isn't the same anymore or that some ability got nerfed. But there is a lot of compelling evidence here that SCM3 did indeed get broken, and there may be additional problems with the mana preservation effect. We wouldn't be so paranoid, but after paladins had LoH silently nerfed, bards received el shaftola once again, and <B>I lost 7 hitpoints with absolutely no explanation,</B> casters have a right to be concerned.<p>Was this a scheme designed to make the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=234821473">Planar AA skill</a> Advanced Spell Casting Mastery more attractive? Or was it just another error in code? There isn't a general patch scheduled this week to fix anything, although lots of <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/scheduled_downtime.jsp">individual servers will be brought down</a> for maintenance. Until there is an official response from Verant, the testing will continue.<p><BIG>Speaking of Official Responses...</BIG><p>On Sunday, no less, John Smedley dropped me an e-mail to address recent concerns that Mobhunter covered regarding the distribution of Planes of Power in Europe and other non-US areas. Rumors have been flying around that localized versions of PoP would be the only opportunity to buy the expansion, forcing many players to either change servers or not upgrade. Smed gives his side:<p><B>Moorgard,<p>I wanted to clear up some misconceptions that are floating around:<p>1) European and UK players WILL be able to get Planes of Power on or around October 21st. We will be offering Planes of Power on a Pre-Order basis to these customers and will attempt to keep the shipping costs extremely reasonable to make sure they don't have to pay a ton to get it sent over.<p>2) We are still working out the exact date of the launch of Planes of Power in the UK and Europe with our partners at UbiSoft. The rumors swirling around now are just that. <p>We very much value our European and UK customers.. we're simply coordinating all of this with the launch of the new localized service with UbiSoft.<p>More information will follow.<p>Thanks very much,<p>John Smedley<br>Chief Operating Officer<br>Sony Online Entertainment</B><p>It should ease readers' minds a bit to know that they will be able to obtain honest, legal copies of the regular version of Planes of Power on the same date the game is released in the US. Nobody will be forced to switch servers or start new characters. That's good news.<p>To take advantage of same-language support, some players may indeed want to use the new localized servers and the specialized EQ software. But at least that will be a choice, and not something forced down anyone's throat.<p>We won't consider the matter closed until all the details are final, but hopefully the spotlight we helped focus on this issue will ease the concerns of non-US-based players.<p><BIG>Viewer Mail</BIG><p>I always thought it was stupid and petty of NBC to prevent David Letterman from using the phrase &quot;Viewer Mail&quot; when he moved his show to CBS, which resulted in him changing the name of the popular Friday segment to &quot;The CBS Mailbag.&quot; As an homage to Dave, we will use the old name when we periodically take a gander at what some of our readers have sent to us.<p>A fella named Kujo wrote in with concern over the wizard's place in the universe:<p><I>Dont you think its a little disinfranchising to the Wizard class that we are a one dimentional class and still only handfulls of us have obtained a luclin NUKE 1 year after the expansion while no other class suffers with thier class defining spell drops?</I><p>Hey, I can appreciate that every caster wants every spell available to his class. That's part of the game, after all. But to call the wizard class &quot;disenfranchised&quot; in any way is like complaining because your Corvette only has one gas pedal. Even without Elnerick's Electrical Rending or Garrison's Superior Sundering, the wizard is a powerful and multi-dimensional class that is very versatile--and racks up the exp in a hurry, to boot. Sorry, but if you're looking for pity on wizards, you've come to the wrong place.<p>A French reader named Brumadar (uh, sorry about all those French jokes) wrote recently to lament the loss of the Gems game. While the last patch answered this problem for him, he wanted to know something else:<p><I>As i'm talking about lost features: will Project M been ever done someday? or is it lost in eternity?</I><p>Project M, as you may remember, was a fun little experiment in which players could create mosters for characters. You could be a fire beetle, for example, and fight against newbies. Though you could only go up a few levels and were restricted on what zones you could play in, it was well received by the player base.<p>So what happened? As a server GM explained it, some players took things a little too far. Though they couldn't speak as a monster, players managed to devise a kind of sign language with which they coordinated their efforts to hunt young characters. The GM told me, &quot;As soon as I saw dozens of fire beetles chasing newbies across the zone, I knew Project M would never go live.&quot; Oh well, it was a nice idea.<p>An enchanter named Nadia wrote in asking why Mobhunter has discriminated against her class:<p><I>why is enchanter the only class MISSING from your sidebar?</I><p>You are correct that we do link to class-specific sites and boards for every class except the enchanter. The reason is that Casters Realm was originally the site for enchanters, and we provide a link to them already. However, we will investigate other enchanter boards, or will at the very least put up a more direct link to CR's enchanter forum, which is kind of buried in their message board hierarchy.<p>Hey, it took us eight months to give in to the pleading of beastlords and put up a link to their board, so you shouldn't feel too bad, Nadia!<p>Finally, Amy writes in pointing out a possible error (gasp!) in one our recent articles:<p><I>did you mean to have a link to britney spear's interest in lesbian porn when you reported about the hot changes in the everquest patch on thursday?</I><p>Amy is actually referring to <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=1550366215">last Monday's update</a>, in which I linked to an article on <a href="http://www.suntimes.co.za/2002/08/25/backpage/back01.asp">Britney's supposed interest</a> in the aforementioned porn. Yes, it was intentional, Amy. You see, from time to time, we have been known to sneak  humorous or interesting links into our stories that don't necessarily have anything to do with EverQuest, but that might inspire a chuckle, or make you wonder what the hell some people are thinking.<p>Besides, when god smiles down upon us enough to combine &quot;Britney Spears&quot; and &quot;lesbian porn&quot; in the same sentence, we cannot help but stand up and take notice.<p>We hope you've enjoyed this trip into the Mobhunter mailbag. As always, <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">keep those cards and letters coming</a>. It may take us months to answer them, but it's not like you have <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/toltanus/">anything better to do</a> anyway.
