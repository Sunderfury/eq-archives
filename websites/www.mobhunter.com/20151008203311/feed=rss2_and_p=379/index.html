		<description><![CDATA[LMAO your not the only ones who sing DEATH KNIGHT... the first day after the expansion came out me and my little bro were saying that all day...

I agree with the story being a good buildup to a let down... but If thats how they wanted to end it... I would have changed the story a bit... making it so unlike most death knights you retain a mesure of your own will and Morgrain eventuially picks up on this... Having some free will of his own... and threw the corse of the build up you learn more of who you were before hand, and eventuially agree to join in with Mor agienst the LK&gt;.

My Dk is currently 76  and I still feel just as powerfull, except for 1 ( 4) man quest Ive been able to solo everything in my path so far.  Tanking is absolutly a BLAST because I honestly donot feel like I am Tanking but that Imm doing signifigant dammage while keeping all the mobs focused on me.  

As to DK being op I am torn on that.  On one hand I agree seeing the things that I am able to do like killing the group mobs solo or in a instance when not tanking and the group is wiping vs a pull or boss... and I am able to do the whole last man standing and finish off the mob or boss while everyone else is dead.  ( healing for over 4k on death strike crits is amaizing ).  but on the other hand... Ive been in groups with other dk&#039;s 2 nights ago in the nexus being the most recent... I was the tank and 2 dk;s were dps ( and dps specced ) I out did both of them combined. ... so to me its more of a class if your very good the class is OP but if your not.... the class is very under performing.

My biggest gripe with the DK is that the general populus has no effin clue what we can and cant do and most of my invites are A to dps instead of tank ( so they can play with what they know over the unknown ) or B I get the 20 questions rutine before the invite ( my guess is they are still looking for a diff class tank during this ) or C people have played with a bad DK or 2... and have the huntard mentality twards them.

So in effect please please please for your game put in a SK / DK type class because the wow DK... has recindled my love for MMO&#039;s]]></description>
