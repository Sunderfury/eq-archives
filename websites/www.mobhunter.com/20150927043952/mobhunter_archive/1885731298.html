Here's what happened.<p>We had to emergency patch to remove an evil duping bug. I'm not going to detail that out, as those details aren't pertinent to the tale at hand.<p>We were also patching to remove some bard stacking problems. There was a way that a bard could, basically, cheat the system and double up on buffs.<p>To fix this problem we changed the way that spells cast from items work for bards. Bards using items that cast spells (not songs) will have those spells act just like regular spells, where they were acting like songs before. Bard songs stack with just about anything, and spells have their own sets of stacking rules. Bards casting spells from items were able to ignore the stacking restrictions of those spells.<p>We changed that. Bards using spells from items will find that they stack just like the spells normally do, not like bard songs.<p>However, one of the components of the patch didn't make it to the servers.<p>That component is the one that tells songs cast off of items to act like songs, not spells.<p>Ok, this is getting complicated. Basically, right now songs cast from items are acting just like spells cast from items, and are trying to stack like spells not like songs. This is causing a lot of item-cast songs to not stack as they should.<p>Having just brought the servers down, we are very reluctant to do so again right away. We're not sure when the update needed to fix this will happen, but it might not be until the next regular patch. Please bear with us until we can get this patched. It took us a long time to remove this 'perk', so maybe you can forgive us for taking a little while to fix the fix...<p>Alan</B><p>Non-bards among you may be wondering what that even means. Let me give you an example.<p>Dain Frostreaver IV in Icewell Keep drops a dandy little item called a <a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/triplatedgoldhacklehammer.html">tri-plated golden hackle hammer</a>. It has a right-click effect that casts <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=610">Arch Shielding</a>, a self-only wizard spell that give a HP, AC, and magic resist buff.<p>This buff is nice, but it doesn't stack with Focus or the talisman line from a shaman. So the Dain's hammer is great for melees who solo, or for use as an insta-click item when fighting mobs that dispell, but the buff itself doesn't get much use on raids when a shaman is along.<p>Bards, however, had this apparently unintended &quot;feature&quot; that caused items which cast spell effects--like the hammer--behave as if the spell was a song, meaning the buff was able to stack with some spells that it wouldn't for other classes. So a bard with the Dain's hammer could get Focus from a shaman *and* use the buff from the Dain's hammer, benefitting from both spells.<p>This &quot;feature&quot; was, however, unintended, and has been &quot;fixed&quot; as part of the emergency patch.<p>However, a new problem has arisen. A bug has been introduced in the aforementioned patch, and now when bards use items that play songs, these songs stack as if they are spells instead--meaning the bard gets even *less* stacking than intended. This &quot;feature&quot; will be corrected in the next patch.<p>The bards over at EQDiva haven't really <a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=1960.topic">said much</a> yet, but I'm sure they'll start soon.<p>Note that the monk epic plays a bard song as its effect, but so far there's no word that monks have been affected.<p>Absor would no doubt think I was picking on him if I pointed out the unusually negative implications of his choice of words: <B>&quot;...a bard could, basically, cheat the system and double up on buffs.&quot;</B><p>I'm sure Alan didn't mean to imply that bards were actually cheating by making use of a very useful ability. After all, there's no way a bard would know their spell-stacking advantage wasn't &quot;working as intended.&quot; No doubt he just made a poor choice of words in this case. As I said, he's usually pretty careful about this kind of stuff.<p>In any case, there will no doubt be some <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8211.topic">fallout</a> from this change, as there has been for just about every move Verant has made lately.<p>So what else is new, right?
