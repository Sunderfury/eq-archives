					<p>I had an absolute blast at New York Comic Con. It wasn&#8217;t has hectic as the San Diego version, which made it quite a bit easier to get around while still having a ton of cool stuff to see. There were some great costumes, as well as some really unfortunate ones&#8211;some of which I still see in my nightmares. Hopefully the therapy kicks in soon and I can sleep through the night again.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t been to a fan convention in quite a while, and I&#8217;d forgotten how much I enjoy them. Industry shows are full of people trying to convince you how smart they are or how they have all the answers; fans conventions are full of people who want to have a good time. The thing that energizes me is that these are people who <em>want to believe </em>in something bigger than themselves. They dream of larger-than-life heroes and villains who live in fantastic worlds somehow grander or more perilous than our own. I get such a charge out of being at shows like this, whether the main focus is comics or video games.</p>
<p>As for what I was actually there for, you can watch the <a href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/31233" title="Hint: I'm the obnoxious one." target="_blank">video recap of our panel on 38 Studios&#8217; first year</a>, or read an <a href="http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/1905" title="Would have loved a spell check, guys." target="_blank">interview I did with MMORPG.com</a>. Sorry, no sneak peaks at the game just yet, but we did showcase our love of pastries. And really, isn&#8217;t that just as good?</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for the steak, Paul!</p>

					<p>So yeah, I watch American Idol. The show is funny at the start of the season, and you end up getting wrapped up in how the contestants do each week. Top 40 isn&#8217;t my thing, but you have to admire the talent of a lot of these people.</p>
<p>That said, the show is just a TV show to me. I haven&#8217;t bought any Kelly Clarkson or Clay Aiken records (honest!), and I pretty much forget who was on previous seasons. But for the first time, there are people on the show this season whose albums I would actually buy: Jason Castro, David Cook, and Brooke White.</p>
<p>Castro has the exact kind of voice and manner I usually buy, so as long as he holds to a singer-songwriter vibe I&#8217;m there. Cook is ready to be a rock star <em>right now</em>, and as long as he doesn&#8217;t get saddled with some 100-year-old producer who tries to drag him into pop hell he should make a great record. And Brooke&#8217;s voice is just startlingly beautiful; she could sing the instruction manual for a cake decorating kit and put tears in your eyes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already bought a few songs via their in-studio iTunes performances: Castro&#8217;s &#8220;Somewhere Over the Rainbow,&#8221; Cook&#8217;s &#8220;Billie Jean&#8221; and &#8220;Eleanor Rigby,&#8221; and Brooke&#8217;s &#8220;Jolene.&#8221; That cross-marketing thing has to be a goldmine for them.</p>
<p>In other TV news, Hell&#8217;s Kitchen continues to be the best thing ever. I try to model my management style after Gordon Ramsay, as Shwayder will attest.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>So I&#8217;m chatting with my old buddy Kohath the other day, and he asks how things are going at 38 Studios. I tell him it&#8217;s great fun and we&#8217;re all really positive about what we&#8217;re doing. Kohath, glass half empty sort that he is, tells me that he worries about the future of MMOs. Specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You guys have an uphill battle differentiating yourselves from all the other MMOs that no one cares about.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At first I laughed his comment off, because I usually spend more time considering all the good games that we will one day have to compete against. But after thinking about it, I wonder if he&#8217;s right: Could the prevalence of crappy MMOs turn people away from the genre so that they never end up seeing the good ones? <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=213#more-213" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>Usually I know better than to listen to Shwayder&#8217;s stupid ideas, but he somehow managed to convince me to work together on a podcast. The first episode is up now. Called <a href="http://www.mmopodcast.com" title="How had nobody snagged this domain before?" target="_blank">Massive Guys on Massive Games</a> (the title being the only clever thing about it), its saving grace is that we will keep our episodes to ten minutes or less.

					<p>Thought I would let folks know about a couple upcoming appearances by yours truly, in case anyone attending would care to buy me drinks and/or throw stuff at me.</p>
<p>On Sunday, April 20, I&#8217;ll be on a <a href="http://www.nycomiccon.com/app/homepage.cfm?appname=100453&amp;moduleID=2525&amp;LinkID=29982&amp;campaignid=61372448&amp;iUserCampaignID=38274317" title="3pm, I think" target="_blank">panel at NYC Comic Con</a> with several other folks from 38 Studios. No, we won&#8217;t be spilling the beans on Copernicus; the panel, arranged by the good folks at <a href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/" target="_blank">Ten Ton Hammer</a>, focuses on the crazy stuff that goes on during the first year of a new game dev studio&#8217;s existence, and what it&#8217;s like to build an MMO based on the vision of people like R.A. Salvatore and Todd McFarlane.</p>
<p>May 13 to 15, I&#8217;ll be in Seattle for the ION Conference, where I&#8217;ll be <a href="http://www.ionconference.com/speaker.php?id=10868" title="Coast to coast Moorgard!" target="_blank">moderating my own panel and speaking on another</a> that was organized by my design cohort, Jason &#8220;Dymus&#8221; Roberts. My panel focuses on taking a community from pre-launch to a live game, while Jason&#8217;s is about lessons learned from making major changes to a live MMO.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been to either New York City or Seattle, so these should be exciting trips. If you&#8217;re at either or both shows, be sure to swing by and say hello. Just leave the rotten vegetables at home, please.</p>

					<p>Proof positive that the <a href="http://mobhunter.com/moorgard/" title="Glory days, my children" target="_blank">Mobhunter tradition</a>  of transforming the face of MMOs is alive and kicking! SOE has once again caved in to a <a href="http://mobhunter.com/001562.html" title="Loral must be drunk with power" target="_blank">carefully crafted and insightful post</a> on my old stomping grounds, dropping dungeon key requirements from the Ruins of Kunark through Prophecy of Ro expansions (at least on the Test server). This time it was the mighty pen of Loral Circlelight who precipitated the revolution instead of yours truly (who, we must not forget, once <a href="http://mobhunter.com/moorgard/-389211046.html" title="I wish the image links still worked" target="_blank">successfully campaigned to have his ball surgically altered</a>).</p>
<p>As  Loral&#8217;s article points out, EverQuest <em>still </em>has a plethora of key requirements after all these years. Blizzard has set a pretty compelling precedent for making older content more accessible as a new stuff is on the immediate horizon. It&#8217;s well past time that EQ followed suit, even if a flood of anger is sure to follow from some of the diehards. For fun, watch the forum threads and count how many times the following phrases appear:</p>
<ul>
<li>dumbing down the game</li>
<li>trivializing my guild&#8217;s accomplishments</li>
<li>letting down your most loyal players</li>
<li>n00b friendly</li>
<li>welfare epics</li>
<li>GG SOE WTF</li>
<li>WoWification</li>
</ul>
<p>Ah, the glorious predictability of community backlash!</p>
<p>By the way, as a developer I realize this change was probably on the table for some time, so Loral&#8217;s article may have just been a case of fortuitous timing. But the fansite guy in me wants to emphasize that the MMO universe needs fans of these games who care enough to champion causes both big and small. Developers really do read and respond to well-reasoned arguments from the community, so please keep the tradition alive.</p>

					<p>Cuppy wrote a <a href="http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=355" title="/wave guildie!" target="_blank">nice piece on WoW&#8217;s quests</a>, using words like &#8220;hideous,&#8221; &#8220;uninspiring,&#8221; &#8220;repetitive,&#8221; &#8220;redundant,&#8221; and &#8220;fun.&#8221; She&#8217;s right, on all counts, though I am powerless to explain CuppyLogic to you. Trust me, just go with it.</p>
<p>At the time both WoW and EQ2 were in development, quests seemed like the natural progression of MMO gameplay. You had a game called Ever<em>Quest</em> which buried its quests under an adversarial interface and often horribly obscure content design. As the next generation of MMOs became a reality, it was a no-brainer that questing should be immediate and accessible as a means to drive gameplay and immerse the player in lore. Instead of hiding the game&#8217;s story away behind NPC dialogue that could only be unlocked by guessing the super-secret password, we would serve it up in a shiny new quest journal. It was gonna be awesome!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t anticipate a couple things. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=209#more-209" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>Lum <a href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/03/31/why-do-you-gotta-make-me-hurt-you-baby/" title="A fine mess" target="_blank">posted some observations</a> on recent community interaction issues that have beset EQ2. Mr. Jennings asserts several points:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;This is a good example of why, as a game developer, you ideally should never let anyone in an MMO know who you are, ever. And you absolutely shouldn’t let people know that you work on the game they play.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;(And it goes without saying, you shouldn’t then cheat, or send out patch notes a week early on your guild message board, or just simply attract the attention of the appropriate gender in your Ventrilo channel with your el33t access, or anything ethically sleazy like that.)&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;For most developers this isn’t an issue, because, frankly, after working on an MMO for 5 years or so, the absolute last thing they want to do is look at it in their limited free time.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree with the second, but disagree with the other two completely, and posted as much in his comment section. But why should I allow such deep, insightful paragraphs to wallow away on someone else&#8217;s site? So I&#8217;m copying and pasting them here so that I get a unique blog entry out of it. I&#8217;m efficient like that, so read on. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=208#more-208" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>
