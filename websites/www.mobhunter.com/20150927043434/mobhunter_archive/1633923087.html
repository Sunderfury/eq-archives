First, there was a site called EQ Monks, and it had a very popular message board, the remnants of which <a href="http://pub18.ezboard.com/fmmrpgdiscussionmonks">still exist</a> today. This site was run by a guy named Korzon--at least I think that's how he spelled it, because he later changed his name to &quot;Q&quot; (thx ST:TNG) and tried to sell the popular message board for $37.29, three rubber bands, and a bean burrito. The outraged monk community screamed &quot;How dare you try to sell our birthright!&quot; and out of the ashes of a bitter dispute came a site called The Dojo.<p>Now, the Dojo was run by a skillful and sardonic writer who called himself the Sensei. He championed the cause of poor monkeys everywhere and did a very good job of holding the class together. Trouble is, he started to believe his own press clippings a bit too much, and crossed that delicate line that exists between community advocate and aimless ranter. At about the same time there was a nasty incident between some posters on his message board, which led to a cascade effect that resulted in the burning down of The Dojo and caused the Sensei's move to a mountain retreat somewhere in the Andes.<p>So another long-time monk named Zadkiel stepped up and created a site called <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/">Monkly-Business</a>, and rallied the troops to follow his banner onto the last, best message board for monkdom. The MB message board has been a good source of info for both neophytes and uberd00ds, and stands up well alongside the best message boards of other classes.<p>Which brings us up to current events. Zadkiel, who retired from EQ about three months ago, is broke and holding the rights to a very popular site and message board. If this had been the dot-com glory days of a few years back, Zad would be riding his own IPO wave and shopping for his third beach house. Instead, he can't afford Christmas presents for his family.<p>Thus, Zadkiel has put a huge <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessageRange?topicID=19226.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25">for sale</a> sign on Monkly-Business, hoping to at least get back a fraction of the money he has spent to maintain his site.<p>Now, Zad isn't going to sell to just any old million--er--thousandaire. Here are the details:<p><B>Now, because the site is so dear to me, I'm not going to sell it to any old Joe who doesn't care about the site, who only cares about the hit rates (which are VERY high) and wants to slap advertising all over it. I want the site to continue on the way it is. For that reason, I am not going to stick it on ebay or anything like that, instead, I am going to sell it to the community.<p>I want $1500 for the site.<p>For that $1500 you will get:<p>1) Ownership of the domain name, which runs out in September 2002 (I bought it for 2 years).<p>2) Full ownership of the ASP code that runs the site...<p>3) Full ownership and access to the server holding the site, that includes direct access to the databases which hold all the data, and FTP access codes.<p>4) Admin rights to this board ...<p>[less-interesting stuff omitted]<p>7) Full rights to the name 'Monkly Business' and any artwork associated with the site for the purposes of merchandising...<p>8) I will also throw in my Account. Whoever takes ownership of the site will also get Zadkiel the character. Zadkiel is a level 60 monk on the Xegony server with 'decent' equipment.</B><p>So, if you have a grand and a half burning a hole in your pocket, this is the fast track to instant monkly fame, right? Well, after pages and pages of responses, the overall thinking seems to be to go with a more democratic plan:<p><B>My hope is that the community can pick one person to be the person who will take over the site from me, and that you will then organise and raise funds however you want to do it to raise the $1500 to buy the site from me to hand over to the new owner.</B><p>It seems like there are worthy candidates to take over the job, and I'm sure the monk community will pick up the tab so that Zadkiel can give out more than a few lumps of coal this season. This seems like a much better plan, as having Zadkiel advertise the fact that he was willing to break the EULA by in effect selling his account wasn't the wisest part of the whole plan.<p>Mobhunter's financial department was looking into buying the Monkly-Business site, but then we realized that all we have under the tree for our own families are some orange peels and moldy bread. Oh well, dot-coms like ours are sure to become hot commodities again soon, right?<p>Right?<p><BIG>I Wonder If Karana Cries at Night</BIG><p>In the spirit of reminiscing, let's think back once more to the good old days, when Aradune--known to us mortals as Brad McQuaid--strode through the Verant offices and put his unique stamp upon communication with the huddled masses of playerdom. We at Mobhunter miss those &quot;Ask Brad&quot; columns, and more than anything miss the human face that Mr. McQuaid put on SOE's corporate machine.<p>Brad is gone now, but Allakhazam has a really nice <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/news/sdetail414.html?story=414">interview</a> with the once and former Avatar of Karana. Yeah, this interview is old news, but Kohath and Csenicier slacked so hard while I was gone that they didn't post a link to it. Just as well, since now I get to talk about it.<p>I won't post too much of the interview here, since you've most likely read it already, but Brad's discussion about what areas of EQ he'd redesign if he could is noteworthy:<p><B>Skill Advancement: This should have to do with choices more so than it does... reaching your skill caps on most of your important skills soon after you level, each and every time, isn't really what we were looking for. Making decisions and deciding to focus on different skills was more in line with what we'd wanted. <p>Damage, AC, and HP: I don't think these three turned out to be equally important, especially at higher levels. They should have been much more so. Same with stats and resistances: they should be more important. <p>Bottom Feeding: This is still an area that bothers me, although attempts to address it were not very popular. I think, however, that had it been addressed at launch players would be used to it and the game a better one. <p>Meditation and other Downtimes: There's too much downtime, but I'd not advocate eliminating it as some others probably would; rather, I'd reduce it a bit and come up with more things to do during that 'rest time' in-between battles. Players need a break from the action... time to discuss what went wrong or right, time to use the restroom or grab a soda. The socialization that occurs during 'downtime' is extremely important and I don't think non-stop Diablo-style combat is good for MMORPGs. That said, when you find out people are finishing Robert Jordan novels while playing EQ, you know things are a bit extreme. <p>Empty Cities/Zones: The world builders spent a lot of time creating interesting, detailed cities, yet many are ignored - there's simply not enough gameplay oriented reasons to use them. Also, many of the older dungeons need to be revamped and made more popular again. I hate to see so many interesting and beautiful zones underpopulated and therefore under-enjoyed.</B><p>Why is this so interesting? Because Brad is in the planning stages for his next MMOG, and we're of the belief that if anyone can catch lightning in a bottle twice, it's Brad. His observations about EQ's shortcomings are right on, and we think he might just be able to come up with the game that could finally drag us kicking and screaming away from our beloved Norrath. Lord knows the current crap--I mean crop--of games competing with EQ isn't going to do that.<p>So rock on, Brad. My only complaint is that it should have been Tann doing that interview...<p><BIG>Oober Noows Lost</BIG><p>It seems Fires of Heaven's association with the Noows message board has <a href="http://www.noows.com/showthread.php?s=d2685bf07f0dcc062edc49f779ef0165&amp;threadid=4776">ended</a>. Those of you who alternate between cold and hot flashes--hating FoH one minute and drooling over their l33tness the next--will have to look for another site to flame them.<p>And if that isn't a cue for a Furor post, I sure as hell don't know what is. Unless he's off hunting for relics in Cam--<p>Nah, couldn't be.
