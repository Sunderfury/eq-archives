					<p>When 38 collapsed, I was deeply depressed. In addition to the usual stresses&#8211;finding a job, providing for your family, the self-doubt&#8211;I was plagued by the nagging sense of work left unfinished. Sure there was a game still in progress, but even more than that was this rich universe of stories that, aside from <a title="Ghosts aplenty" href="http://amalur.wikia.com/wiki/Amalur_Wiki">Reckoning</a>, were going to go untold. Though the story of Amalur was in every way a team effort, I took it personally. It felt like my life&#8217;s work was ripped away, utterly out of my control. It still sits on some hard drives in Rhode Island, songs left unsung. And though it still haunts me, I&#8217;ve come to terms with it.</p>
<p>Being let go from SOE/Daybreak is a different feeling. Yes, all the usual stresses are there, but at least the project I was on continues. I respect and like the designers still on the project, and I know work I did will see the light of day, even if it ends up being different from how I might have done it. Things are in good hands. And yeah, I regret that I won&#8217;t be there in the trenches as those stories come to life, but at least I can point to a body of work (the <a title="Novellas and short stories." href="https://www.everquestnext.com/media?category=ebook">EQN ebooks</a> we&#8217;ve released) as tangible evidence of my contribution. I can make peace with that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting the job search again, but I&#8217;m in a much more positive, healthy space than I was last time. While looking for work isn&#8217;t what I&#8217;d call an ideal process, things could be a lot worse. Trust me.

					<p>Today I was released from Daybreak Game Company, which is to say the entity that was Sony Online Entertainment. I&#8217;d been back for about two-and-a-half years following 38 Studios&#8217; collapse, and they were very kind to offer me a position on Landmark and EverQuest Next. I had a great time and worked with fantastic people, and I&#8217;m sad to see that come to an end. But the thing about this business is that the connections you make last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Jobs come and go. Some are terrific; others less so. But relationships endure. No matter what line of work you do, if you work hard and support those around you, good things will come your way. It&#8217;s proven true across the various careers I&#8217;ve had.</p>
<p>I poured my heart into the story for EQN, just as I did for Amalur before it. Norrath is in good hands, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what Daybreak achieves.

					<p>I&#8217;ll soon be heading up to Vegas for yet another SOE Live. I&#8217;m pretty excited, as we&#8217;ve got some great panels on fiction and the content of EQNext.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also terrified, because I&#8217;ll be on stage in front of several thousand people to talk during a small portion of the keynote speech. I love doing panels, but standing in the spotlight of the big stage is another thing altogether. It&#8217;s early in the morning on Friday, so with any luck I&#8217;ll be too tired to be nervous. Sadly, though, Vegas and luck don&#8217;t usually go hand in hand for me.</p>
<p>These shows are a ton of work, but seeing the reaction of the fans makes it all worth it. I know that sounds cliche, but it&#8217;s actually true. So come say hi if you&#8217;re there, I&#8217;d love to chat!</p>

					<p>There were layoffs today at SOE. I was not among them, but it was a shitty day anyway. It&#8217;s something that happens way too often in our industry. My personal scars are still fresh, and the events of today have made old wounds ache once more.</p>
<p>Some of the layoffs hit very close to home&#8211;many folks had been fixtures at SOE a long time, and were doing great work. I don&#8217;t know the logic behind who was let go and who wasn&#8217;t&#8211;that&#8217;s the kind of thing companies don&#8217;t go into detail on. It is what it is.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m very glad to still have a job, I can&#8217;t help but feel a bit of survivor&#8217;s guilt. Why them and not me? I try not to dwell on it, because doing so accomplishes nothing. Better to spend that mental energy trying to help those folks make connections and find a safe place to land. Assuming there&#8217;s any safe place, I mean.</p>
<p>I remain in the games industry, even through the heartbreak of days like today, because it&#8217;s immensely fulfilling on a creative level and I feel that my best work on MMOs is still ahead of me. Yet events like this make me wish my destiny was more in my own hands and less at the mercy of others.

					<p>There are various dates one can identify with the death of 38 Studios. You could cite the day the company failed to pay its employees. You could choose the date the company declared bankruptcy. For me, 38 Studios was about the team and the friendships we shared, so I mark May 24 as the point it ended&#8211;the day we were officially laid off and walked out of our office together for the last time.</p>
<p>As one of my former colleagues recently noted, in some ways it feels like barely any time has passed; in other ways, it feels like a hundred years. There remains a surreal quality to the whole thing, a disbelief that it ever really happened. Yet there are reminders of it everywhere in my life, reminders that leave a sense of unfinished business.</p>
<p>The studio and its most recognizable faces still turn up in the news regularly. Most recently, the lawsuit against Curt and others involved in the bond deal has made headlines, along with an article saying that the IP and assets are finally going up for sale. The former is a farce grounded in political posturing, an attempt to shift blame away from politicians who want to be reelected. I&#8217;m confident the truth will come to light.</p>
<p>The latter is more personal. My blood and dreams flow through Amalur; the lack of closure has left me unsettled. The prospect of someone finally buying the work that my friends and I put so much of ourselves into leaves me with mixed feelings. Copernicus will never see the light of day, at least not in the form we intended it to take. Some buyer with an engine and a suitable back-end could take the considerable assets we created and plug them into their game, instantly owning some of the best looking characters, environments, and animations on the market. While much of the focus in the press has been on the MMO, another possibility often overlooked would be to take the work the BHG team had done on pre-production for Reckoning 2 and release a sequel. The first game was well-reviewed and it continues to attract players, so there&#8217;s definitely money to be made if a company could do it right. But with the key members of both teams spread across the globe, the chances of pulling off a successful product are slim at best. After all, it&#8217;s the teams who truly make their games shine&#8211;not assets on a hard drive.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I&#8217;d love to see something finally come about from all the work we did. But if the result is some stranger butchering our material and slapping the Amalur logo on shoddy work, I&#8217;d rather the assets just fade away into the mists of time. I can only hope that if someone does buy it, they treat it with the respect it deserves and realize they&#8217;ve acquired something pretty special. We&#8217;ll soon find out.</p>
<p>Today I read that it takes half the duration of a relationship to finally get over it. If that&#8217;s true, I&#8217;ve got at least a couple more years before I can truly move on. But that&#8217;s okay; despite the challenges and pain I&#8217;ve felt since it ended, the memories and friendships forged at 38 continue to enrich my life, and have given me countless lessons to draw upon in my career going foward.</p>
<p>It was all worth it&#8230; every beautiful, heartbreaking minute.

					<p>Looks like it&#8217;s been a while since I posted anything that wasn&#8217;t mopey. A rough few months will do that to you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to be able to deliver happier news: I am once again gainfully employed, at the place where my career in games began: Sony Online Entertainment. I lead the design team as Creative Director on Vanguard, which has recently been converted into a free-to-play title.</p>
<p>It was an unexpected turn of events that led me back. Truth be told, I&#8217;d accepted a position at another company in a different state, but an old friend called with an offer I couldn&#8217;t refuse. Though I&#8217;d been away nearly six years, the folks at SOE have made me feel very welcome&#8211;a fantastic feeling.</p>
<p>So, why SOE? And why Vanguard?</p>
<p>Though being part of an epic collapse after years spent working on a large-scale MMO tends to have a negative effect on one&#8217;s psyche, ultimately I love this genre and couldn&#8217;t bear to stay away from it. There&#8217;s simply no challenge in game development like it. And yes, it&#8217;s risky, but when it works it&#8217;s very satisfying. I loved my time at SOE and made many great friends, so being asked back was a true honor.</p>
<p>As for Vanguard, I have a certain personal history with the title. I was community manager on EQ2 while Vanguard was in development, and I heard from a lot of people who told me how the latter was going to stomp all over the former. But despite some initial hard feelings over that flack, I couldn&#8217;t help but root for Vanguard; as an old-school EQ fanboy, it sounded like the type of game I really wanted to play. I was genuinely disappointed at the state of the game at launch and how it dwindled soon after.</p>
<p>But things change. After surviving with almost no development support for years, the conversion to free-to-play has breathed new life into the game&#8211;enough that SOE has made a serious commitment to it. Thus the hiring of folks like me, as well as bringing back some others who&#8217;ve worked on Vanguard in the past. It&#8217;s a lean, dedicated team made up of people who love the game and want to see it live up to its potential. Especially after the events of recent months, that&#8217;s the kind of redemption story I can really get behind.</p>
<p>Working on a live game again feels good, and making my way back to the <a title="My new turf!" href="http://forums.station.sony.com/vg/forums/list.m" target="_blank">forums</a> is exciting too. I&#8217;ve even got FanFaire&#8211;er, <a title="In Vegas, natch." href="http://www.soe.com/soelive/" target="_blank">SOE Live</a> this week!</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to homecomings&#8230; and happier days.

				<div class="entry">
					<p>As of today, everyone at 38 Studios Providence and Baltimore has been laid off.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very sad end to nearly six years of great work. Despite the odds, I believed in the dream we all shared. I believed with all my heart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure the public will ever know the beauty of what we built&#8230; that&#8217;s maybe the hardest part of it all. We snuck out a pretty, but dated, environment fly-through and a few key images, but there is so much more that would take your breath away. I truly hope you get to see it, in some form.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what will happen to Amalur. It will no doubt be tied up in various legal proceedings for some time, both game assets and the intellectual property as a whole.</p>
<p>As people lay blame and the commentators turn a heartbreaking situation into the latest industry punchline, some will probably portray the team as a bunch of screw-ups who couldn&#8217;t ship a game. The story has so, so much more to it than that. In short order, you will start hearing truths, half-truths, and lies, as well as things that are true from a certain perspective. In the end, perspectives are what makes up history&#8230; real truth lies in the midst of it somewhere.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday I&#8217;ll talk more about my perspective&#8230; but not today.</p>
<p>Today, I mourn for what almost was. Because believe it or not, we came <em>so close </em>to pulling it off.</p>
<p>On to the next dream.

<p>Why is this cool? Well, it&#8217;s like being paid to play demos for two of the best games of 2012. It&#8217;s also cool because of the thought and attention put into this idea. The details were lovingly nurtured, down to the symbols that appear on the armor. There&#8217;s a story in everything.</p>
<p>Reckoning is the gateway to <a title="The one true world." href="http://www.amalur.com/" target="_blank">Amalur</a>, the setting for our upcoming MMO as well. I&#8217;m proud to have worked on these games, and can&#8217;t wait until they&#8217;re in players hands!</p>

					<p>This is a big freaking list. Either I&#8217;m getting worse at narrowing down my choices for favorite albums, or maybe it really was just that good a year. There were a ton of releases I really liked, with an exciting blend of new talent along with reliable veterans making some of their best records in ages.</p>
<p>The downside of this phenomenon is that it takes me a hell of a long time to write this annual music post, and I&#8217;m inherently lazy. But man, there&#8217;s some music here I just really have to talk about. So here we go.</p>

					<p>Don&#8217;t get around much anymore&#8211;in blog posts, I mean. But hey, as long as I can stay ahead of <a title="Lazier than I am!" href="http://www.hartsman.com/" target="_blank">Hartsman</a> (who, as a big-money executive, does no actual work and thus lacks any excuse for not blogging), I figure I&#8217;m doing okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m headed down to New York Comic Con this week for a panel scheduled on Friday at 1:30 pm called <a title="Come one, come all" href="http://nycc11.mapyourshow.com/5_0/sessions/sessiondetails.cfm?ScheduledSessionID=1BAFC8" target="_blank">Creating a World Worth Saving</a>. I&#8217;ll be joining our own Creator of Worlds, R.A. Salvatore, plus Andrew Auseon and Ian Frazier from the <a title="Hey, you can preorder it" href="http://www.reckoning.com" target="_blank">Reckoning</a> team. We&#8217;ll talk both theory and practice of how you develop a world meant to span a whole ecosystem of products, and in specific about how we used those principles to craft the narrative of the RPG.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still <em>slightly </em>too early to reveal hard facts about our MMO, but I&#8217;ll sneak some storyline tidbits in there. Until our PR guy tackles me and drags me from the stage, that is.
