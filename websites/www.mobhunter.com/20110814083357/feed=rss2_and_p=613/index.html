		<description>1) No. Just like used car sales are not a blight on car companies.
2) I agree but... I think the question is the &quot;pure&quot; subscription mmo dead, in which case I&#039;d say yes. Hybrid sub/micro is the future.
3) Is it why you should never acccept a &quot;temporary relocation to rathe mountains&quot; because it means you&#039;ll get stuck there? Poor frogs. 
4) I just bought an m11x mostly based on your glowing review. Trust me, the iPad is nice but it&#039;s development has stalled and I&#039;d wait for apple to release gen2. 

P.S. Post more! Hire an assistant to evangelize the RPG!</description>

		<description>I bet you can&#039;t.

Actually, I chose the title because it&#039;s the name of an episode of The Prisoner. I had no idea they stole the title from High Noon, but that makes perfect sense!</description>

		<description>Interesting that you chose the 1st line of &quot;High Noon&quot; as your post title.  I can&#039;t help but wonder if that&#039;s supposed to be a clue about something.  Or it could just be that you&#039;re torn between duty (work) and love (of blogging), just as the song describes.  Guess I shouldn&#039;t overthink things, no?

And believe me, I can completely see the &quot;Truth, Lies, and Frogloks&quot; post in my mind already ;)</description>

		<description>&quot;I know many of you are anxious for more news on the MMO, but our promotional efforts are focused on the RPG right now&quot;

I don&#039;t really believe the MMO will ever happen at this point, but especially so if the RPG doesn&#039;t go yard. And what promotional efforts? That generic video? Another piece of concept art?</description>
