There are eight on <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/filters/products/screenindex/0,11104,559826,00.html?page=1">page one</a> and three more on <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/filters/products/screenindex/0,11104,559826,00.html?page=2">page two</a>. Click those links and take a gander at some freaky planar mobs.<p>People who want to sue Verant make a big deal out of phrases like &quot;EverCrack,&quot; but we really do have to wonder what sort of narcotics the PoP design team was on when they came up with some of these mobs. The gargoyle/demon thing is downright creepy, and the multi-mouthed lobster-beast is freaking gross!<p>Still, if the l3wtz are ph@t enough, the nightmares are worth it. At least, that's my motto.<p>It's good that we're seeing some odd looking new NPCs in PoP. Luclin was a little light on new models, when you think about it. Aliens, six-armed guys, robes, mushrooms, and red tribal brutes are everywhere. I don't like it when models get reused over and over. Frogloks, anyone?<p>Okay, that's enough of a news break for now. Thanks to SGD for the tip. Have a good weekend!
