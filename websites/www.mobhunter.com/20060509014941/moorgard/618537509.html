However, with a charmed pet, I have a good reason to buy this spell. Thanks for any input.<p>Logix Spybreak<br>55th Dark Elven Enchanter<br>Ayonae Ro</B><p>No, it's not going to work on charmed pets. As several people have noticed, it would lead to the spell being used as a substitute for Call of the Hero and a other possible abuses, such as summoning NPCs to a safe spot to kill them.<p>Tsnoi wrote:<p><B>&quot;Provide me a roleplaying reason why Enchanters now have the ability to Summon. Then give me access to other Summoning abilities.&quot;<p>Absor, let me answer this, please? Enchanters have always had limited summon abilities. Unlike other casters, the enchanter can summon a life essence and attach it to his tiny daggers thereby enchanting them to serve as a pet. This same force that is bound to the pet originally can be &quot;resummoned&quot; from somewhere in the zone back to you. I don't see why summoning a creature back to you would be any harder than creating that creature in the first place.<p>Notice, even though the mage might be considered the best summoner in the game, many classes have summon abilities. All magic uses learn a bit of each school of magic though they learn to use them quite diffently. After all, a lot of the spells are all about how you look at them. Fear could be viewed as summoning fright from deep within the targets mind, and enduring breath may summon air directly into the targets lungs. Enchanters learn these because their studies focus on spells that effect things all ready in existence even though they are the exact same spells used by other classes (thats why one version of the spell can be scribed by any class that accesses that spell.) So you already have access to other summon spells if you wish to view it that way, but you will never have access to some of the spells that other classes have spent their lifetime researching.</B><p>People never seem to believe me when I tell them that it's easy to come up with an in-context reason for anything. This one is pretty easy. I like yours. But for me it's just as easy to say that the enchanter just recreates the pet at the new location, pulling its energy out (he put it there afterall) to use to form the new one.<p>Slibus wrote:<p><B>Is giving all pet casters Summon Companion your solution to the pathing problems/bugs that have existed in your game for the better part of it's existance?<p>Between that, and the upcoming nerf of Call of the Hero, every mage 55+ will be quitting out of frustration.</B><p>It's certainly helpful for dealing with pathing problems, yes. And, yes, that's the only reason we're passing it out to other classes.<p>Does this mean that we are not working on fixing pathing problems? No. It means that we recognize that they exist and want to make dealing with them easier. Keep sending us pathing issues and we'll keep fixing them.<p>But don't tell me that handing this spell out to others is ruining Magicians. It's not. As for the potential change to Call of Hero... we don't even know what that will be, if anything, so I think it's a little too early to be worried about that.<p>Alan</I><p>Personally, I don't think it's <i>ever</i> too early to be worried when you see your class's unique abilities start dwindling away (*cough* monks *cough*), but I don't draw a Sony paycheck so what do I know?<p>As for pathing bugs, well, those just don't ever go away. You'd think Verant would have mastered the pathing process by now, but then you see some of the zones in Velious (*cough* Icewell *cough*) and you realize that pathing bugs will be around for as long as the game is.
