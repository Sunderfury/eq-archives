		<description><![CDATA[60k is pretty impressive, but be careful what you wish for with more presence. 

If its a good conference, you don&#039;t want it to wind up on a 3 year curve. eg. Next year, a few bigger names will drop in, the year after that, a few more, along with a throng of media. Wait, media&#039;s here? We need a bigger stage and a new demo. After that, fans tend to stop coming as publishers start to focus on entertaining the media types rather than the fans..

This happens in many industries, just replace fans with customers, and media with Consultants. When the consultants outnumber the buyers, its time to get out of the conference.]]></description>
