That sounds great, but unfortunately it <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-743524237">doesn't work too well</a>--or at all, if you're the owner of an AMD CPU.<p>Absor provides a good description of the UseUmbra=false tweak and explains why it probably won't help you after all: <p><B>Here's the deal with this UseUmbra thing. It will indeed affect the game if you add this line to your eqclient.ini file (under the [Defaults] section). It, basically, disables Umbra functionality.<p>Let me try to explain when it might be useful to set add this line to your eqclient.ini file.<p>Turning off Umbra can have a big impact on the performance you see indoor Luclin zones. If you frequent such zones, adding this line and setting it False will probably be a bad thing.<p>If you don't have Luclin installed, then adding the line and setting it to false might be of some use to you, at least for a while (*I'll explain that later).<p>But for most situations it's not really possible for me to guess how it will affect you, since so much of performance is based on hardware and drivers. But you can certainly experiment with this switch if you'd like. For most people you will be better off not messing with it at all.<p>*(This is later) - We currently have some .dlls on the Test server that enhance the functionality of Umbra. For the most part setting this to False disables tools that improve your performance. With the fix we have on Test many of the issues that people are seeing seem to be corrected (hitches when people zone in and poor framerates). It is also very likely that some day soon we will be setting that UseUmbra switch programmatically and ignoring any setting in the eqclient.ini file so that you can get the best performance based on the zone you are in.<p>So please feel free to use this setting if you think it helps your system. But be aware that setting it False will probably harm your performance with indoor Luclin zones.<p>Alan</B><p>I concur with Absor. I tried this tweak and played in Fungus Grove, and my performance went right down the crapper. It seems indoor Luclin zones are tied to Umbra, whether it works for your CPU or not.<p>The one thing that did improve greatly was zoning. I mean, moving from zone to zone took a fraction of the time it usually does. Unfortunately, the massive slowdown in those indoor Luclin zones made me disable the feature. There's too much indoor fun there to mess around.<p><BIG>Seru! Seru Very Much!</BIG><p>Over on Ayonae Ro server, Lord Inquisitor Seru--xenophobe, racist, and attempted murderer--was dispatched from the safety of his sanctum after a <a href="http://pub42.ezboard.com/fayonaerofrm1.showMessage?topicID=1560.topic">45-minute fight</a>. Sweet battle, and the loot must have been incredible, right?<p>&quot;Incredible&quot;--in the sense of something that isn't credible--is a good word for it. For instance, an item called Sword of Truth dropped, a 75/45 1HS weapons with loads of stats. The downside? It can't be equipped by anyone. Besides the sword, a tunic with -99AC and other negative stats. Nice, eh?<p>What's going on? Has Verant turned out to be just plain mean? Not exactly. See, the way you're supposed to get up to Seru's room is to complete a quest for a key. Unfortunately, the quest doesn't seem to be in the game at this point. But thanks to the way Verant designed his tower, you can be gravity fluxed into it and bypass the quest. To ensure that this &quot;exploit&quot; isn't rewarded, Verant changed Seru's loot from being the best stuff in the game into the jokes that dropped on Ayonae Ro (it seems Seru has died several times in the past, but the stats on the original loot didn't make the rounds).<p>Is gag loot the future of high-end encounters that Verant hasn't fine-tuned yet? I guess we'll see. In the meantime, we have a few item suggestions for Abashi and company:<p>- A 100% weight-reducing bag that weighs 90 stones<p>- A caster mask that gives 200 mana but has Effect: Human Sight (i.e. night blindness) which cannot be overwritten<p>- A BP with 150AC that randomly casts Translocate: Tox Forest on your group members<p>We could go on all day, but I think we've given Verant enough suggestions for itemizing ubermobs. Can't wait to see the &quot;Bag of Moorgard&quot; in game!<p><BIG>How Much Do the <I>Flying</I> Horses Cost?</BIG><p>Snipp--Mobhunter reader and gnome warlord of the Bertoxxulous server--told us a <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9493.topic">story</a> about how a bug in the Plane of Sky allowed his little pony to fly him between islands that are otherwise accessible only with keys or by having your corpse summoned. It's fitting, I guess--if there's anyone who would come up with a way to make a pony fly, it's a gnome. Expect the nerf to arrive any day now.<p>Thanks for the story, Snipp.
