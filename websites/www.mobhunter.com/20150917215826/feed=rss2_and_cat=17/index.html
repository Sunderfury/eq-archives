				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a few months of convalescing after the big layoff, I now begin the next phase of my career. I have accepted a position at Blizzard Entertainment working on World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting step for me. Blizzard has a proven track record of shipping quality products, and as a longtime lover of MMOs, it&#8217;s a thrill to go to work on the most successful title my favorite genre has ever seen. It will be a huge honor and challenge to try to make my own mark on the game. An added bonus is reuniting with a bunch of my former 38 colleagues who also work at Blizzard. This is going to be fun!</p>
<p>For reference, the title of this post refers to the big milestones in my career since moving into game development. Phase one was starting at SOE back in 2003. Phase two was helping found 38 Studios in 2006. Phase three was my return to SOE in 2012. Phase four begins now, in May of 2015.</p>
<p>Many folks would be happy to have enjoyed just one of those experiences, so I count myself as very fortunate to be given the opportunity to continue my journey. Thanks for all your support over the last few months, and I hope I can count on it going forward.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When 38 collapsed, I was deeply depressed. In addition to the usual stresses&#8211;finding a job, providing for your family, the self-doubt&#8211;I was plagued by the nagging sense of work left unfinished. Sure there was a game still in progress, but even more than that was this rich universe of stories that, aside from <a title="Ghosts aplenty" href="http://amalur.wikia.com/wiki/Amalur_Wiki">Reckoning</a>, were going to go untold. Though the story of Amalur was in every way a team effort, I took it personally. It felt like my life&#8217;s work was ripped away, utterly out of my control. It still sits on some hard drives in Rhode Island, songs left unsung. And though it still haunts me, I&#8217;ve come to terms with it.</p>
<p>Being let go from SOE/Daybreak is a different feeling. Yes, all the usual stresses are there, but at least the project I was on continues. I respect and like the designers still on the project, and I know work I did will see the light of day, even if it ends up being different from how I might have done it. Things are in good hands. And yeah, I regret that I won&#8217;t be there in the trenches as those stories come to life, but at least I can point to a body of work (the <a title="Novellas and short stories." href="https://www.everquestnext.com/media?category=ebook">EQN ebooks</a> we&#8217;ve released) as tangible evidence of my contribution. I can make peace with that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting the job search again, but I&#8217;m in a much more positive, healthy space than I was last time. While looking for work isn&#8217;t what I&#8217;d call an ideal process, things could be a lot worse. Trust me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I was released from Daybreak Game Company, which is to say the entity that was Sony Online Entertainment. I&#8217;d been back for about two-and-a-half years following 38 Studios&#8217; collapse, and they were very kind to offer me a position on Landmark and EverQuest Next. I had a great time and worked with fantastic people, and I&#8217;m sad to see that come to an end. But the thing about this business is that the connections you make last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Jobs come and go. Some are terrific; others less so. But relationships endure. No matter what line of work you do, if you work hard and support those around you, good things will come your way. It&#8217;s proven true across the various careers I&#8217;ve had.</p>
<p>I poured my heart into the story for EQN, just as I did for Amalur before it. Norrath is in good hands, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what Daybreak achieves.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also terrified, because I&#8217;ll be on stage in front of several thousand people to talk during a small portion of the keynote speech. I love doing panels, but standing in the spotlight of the big stage is another thing altogether. It&#8217;s early in the morning on Friday, so with any luck I&#8217;ll be too tired to be nervous. Sadly, though, Vegas and luck don&#8217;t usually go hand in hand for me.</p>
<p>These shows are a ton of work, but seeing the reaction of the fans makes it all worth it. I know that sounds cliche, but it&#8217;s actually true. So come say hi if you&#8217;re there, I&#8217;d love to chat!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were layoffs today at SOE. I was not among them, but it was a shitty day anyway. It&#8217;s something that happens way too often in our industry. My personal scars are still fresh, and the events of today have made old wounds ache once more.</p>
<p>Some of the layoffs hit very close to home&#8211;many folks had been fixtures at SOE a long time, and were doing great work. I don&#8217;t know the logic behind who was let go and who wasn&#8217;t&#8211;that&#8217;s the kind of thing companies don&#8217;t go into detail on. It is what it is.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m very glad to still have a job, I can&#8217;t help but feel a bit of survivor&#8217;s guilt. Why them and not me? I try not to dwell on it, because doing so accomplishes nothing. Better to spend that mental energy trying to help those folks make connections and find a safe place to land. Assuming there&#8217;s any safe place, I mean.</p>
<p>I remain in the games industry, even through the heartbreak of days like today, because it&#8217;s immensely fulfilling on a creative level and I feel that my best work on MMOs is still ahead of me. Yet events like this make me wish my destiny was more in my own hands and less at the mercy of others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are various dates one can identify with the death of 38 Studios. You could cite the day the company failed to pay its employees. You could choose the date the company declared bankruptcy. For me, 38 Studios was about the team and the friendships we shared, so I mark May 24 as the point it ended&#8211;the day we were officially laid off and walked out of our office together for the last time.</p>
<p>As one of my former colleagues recently noted, in some ways it feels like barely any time has passed; in other ways, it feels like a hundred years. There remains a surreal quality to the whole thing, a disbelief that it ever really happened. Yet there are reminders of it everywhere in my life, reminders that leave a sense of unfinished business.</p>
<p>The studio and its most recognizable faces still turn up in the news regularly. Most recently, the lawsuit against Curt and others involved in the bond deal has made headlines, along with an article saying that the IP and assets are finally going up for sale. The former is a farce grounded in political posturing, an attempt to shift blame away from politicians who want to be reelected. I&#8217;m confident the truth will come to light.</p>
<p>The latter is more personal. My blood and dreams flow through Amalur; the lack of closure has left me unsettled. The prospect of someone finally buying the work that my friends and I put so much of ourselves into leaves me with mixed feelings. Copernicus will never see the light of day, at least not in the form we intended it to take. Some buyer with an engine and a suitable back-end could take the considerable assets we created and plug them into their game, instantly owning some of the best looking characters, environments, and animations on the market. While much of the focus in the press has been on the MMO, another possibility often overlooked would be to take the work the BHG team had done on pre-production for Reckoning 2 and release a sequel. The first game was well-reviewed and it continues to attract players, so there&#8217;s definitely money to be made if a company could do it right. But with the key members of both teams spread across the globe, the chances of pulling off a successful product are slim at best. After all, it&#8217;s the teams who truly make their games shine&#8211;not assets on a hard drive.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I&#8217;d love to see something finally come about from all the work we did. But if the result is some stranger butchering our material and slapping the Amalur logo on shoddy work, I&#8217;d rather the assets just fade away into the mists of time. I can only hope that if someone does buy it, they treat it with the respect it deserves and realize they&#8217;ve acquired something pretty special. We&#8217;ll soon find out.</p>
<p>Today I read that it takes half the duration of a relationship to finally get over it. If that&#8217;s true, I&#8217;ve got at least a couple more years before I can truly move on. But that&#8217;s okay; despite the challenges and pain I&#8217;ve felt since it ended, the memories and friendships forged at 38 continue to enrich my life, and have given me countless lessons to draw upon in my career going foward.</p>
<p>It was all worth it&#8230; every beautiful, heartbreaking minute.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looks like it&#8217;s been a while since I posted anything that wasn&#8217;t mopey. A rough few months will do that to you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to be able to deliver happier news: I am once again gainfully employed, at the place where my career in games began: Sony Online Entertainment. I lead the design team as Creative Director on Vanguard, which has recently been converted into a free-to-play title.</p>
<p>It was an unexpected turn of events that led me back. Truth be told, I&#8217;d accepted a position at another company in a different state, but an old friend called with an offer I couldn&#8217;t refuse. Though I&#8217;d been away nearly six years, the folks at SOE have made me feel very welcome&#8211;a fantastic feeling.</p>
<p>So, why SOE? And why Vanguard?</p>
<p>Though being part of an epic collapse after years spent working on a large-scale MMO tends to have a negative effect on one&#8217;s psyche, ultimately I love this genre and couldn&#8217;t bear to stay away from it. There&#8217;s simply no challenge in game development like it. And yes, it&#8217;s risky, but when it works it&#8217;s very satisfying. I loved my time at SOE and made many great friends, so being asked back was a true honor.</p>
<p>As for Vanguard, I have a certain personal history with the title. I was community manager on EQ2 while Vanguard was in development, and I heard from a lot of people who told me how the latter was going to stomp all over the former. But despite some initial hard feelings over that flack, I couldn&#8217;t help but root for Vanguard; as an old-school EQ fanboy, it sounded like the type of game I really wanted to play. I was genuinely disappointed at the state of the game at launch and how it dwindled soon after.</p>
<p>But things change. After surviving with almost no development support for years, the conversion to free-to-play has breathed new life into the game&#8211;enough that SOE has made a serious commitment to it. Thus the hiring of folks like me, as well as bringing back some others who&#8217;ve worked on Vanguard in the past. It&#8217;s a lean, dedicated team made up of people who love the game and want to see it live up to its potential. Especially after the events of recent months, that&#8217;s the kind of redemption story I can really get behind.</p>
<p>Working on a live game again feels good, and making my way back to the <a title="My new turf!" href="http://forums.station.sony.com/vg/forums/list.m" target="_blank">forums</a> is exciting too. I&#8217;ve even got FanFaire&#8211;er, <a title="In Vegas, natch." href="http://www.soe.com/soelive/" target="_blank">SOE Live</a> this week!</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to homecomings&#8230; and happier days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of today, everyone at 38 Studios Providence and Baltimore has been laid off.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very sad end to nearly six years of great work. Despite the odds, I believed in the dream we all shared. I believed with all my heart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure the public will ever know the beauty of what we built&#8230; that&#8217;s maybe the hardest part of it all. We snuck out a pretty, but dated, environment fly-through and a few key images, but there is so much more that would take your breath away. I truly hope you get to see it, in some form.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what will happen to Amalur. It will no doubt be tied up in various legal proceedings for some time, both game assets and the intellectual property as a whole.</p>
<p>As people lay blame and the commentators turn a heartbreaking situation into the latest industry punchline, some will probably portray the team as a bunch of screw-ups who couldn&#8217;t ship a game. The story has so, so much more to it than that. In short order, you will start hearing truths, half-truths, and lies, as well as things that are true from a certain perspective. In the end, perspectives are what makes up history&#8230; real truth lies in the midst of it somewhere.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday I&#8217;ll talk more about my perspective&#8230; but not today.</p>
<p>Today, I mourn for what almost was. Because believe it or not, we came <em>so close </em>to pulling it off.</p>
<p>On to the next dream.</p>

<p>Why is this cool? Well, it&#8217;s like being paid to play demos for two of the best games of 2012. It&#8217;s also cool because of the thought and attention put into this idea. The details were lovingly nurtured, down to the symbols that appear on the armor. There&#8217;s a story in everything.</p>
<p>Reckoning is the gateway to <a title="The one true world." href="http://www.amalur.com/" target="_blank">Amalur</a>, the setting for our upcoming MMO as well. I&#8217;m proud to have worked on these games, and can&#8217;t wait until they&#8217;re in players hands!</p>
<p>The time draws near&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a big freaking list. Either I&#8217;m getting worse at narrowing down my choices for favorite albums, or maybe it really was just that good a year. There were a ton of releases I really liked, with an exciting blend of new talent along with reliable veterans making some of their best records in ages.</p>
<p>The downside of this phenomenon is that it takes me a hell of a long time to write this annual music post, and I&#8217;m inherently lazy. But man, there&#8217;s some music here I just really have to talk about. So here we go.</p>
<p><span id="more-669"></span><strong>&gt;&gt; Like It &lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>She Wants Revenge &#8211; <em>Valleyheart</em></strong><em> </em>- Though their latest effort is less consistent than their first two records, there are enough good songs on <em>Valleyheart</em> to justify further faith in the band. When they&#8217;re at their best, they  explore the obsessive/compulsive side of sex and love. When the band  misses the mark, it&#8217;s because they get a bit too self-indulgent. I hope a  little more darkness creeps into their next record.</p>
<p><strong>St. Vincent &#8211; <em>Strange Mercy</em></strong> &#8211; I must admit this was one of the records I was waiting all year to hear, because the last album, <em>Actor</em>, was unadulterated brilliance. <em>Strange Mercy</em> is a bit more grounded and, in places, slower moving than its  predecessor. Still a really strong record, though I&#8217;m not sure anything  could live up to my expectations. Honestly, I&#8217;m trying not to sound like  a downer&#8211;this is great stuff&#8211;but I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s gripped me as much  as I&#8217;d hoped.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Waits -<em> Bad As Me</em></strong><em> </em>- If you&#8217;re intimidated by  the huge and varied back catalog of Tom Waits but want to dive in and  discover what all the fuss is about, <em>Bad As Me</em> makes a fantastic  entry point. Waits sounds as gravelly as ever, and the songs here are as  accessible as anything he&#8217;s done before.</p>
<p><strong>Lights &#8211; <em>Siberia</em></strong><em> </em>- How does a Canadian electronica act make my annual list of favorite records? By releasing an album of catchy, danceable anthems that happen to be great pop songs. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that Valerie Anne Poxleitner has the kind of spare, hypnotic vocals that I find so intriguing.  The production here is tight and direct, emphasizing the charm but  retaining a hint of the bleak landscape that gives the album its title.</p>
<p><strong>The Lonely Island &#8211; <em>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</em></strong> &#8211; Usually, musical comedy albums have a pretty short shelf life for me.  Exceptions to this rule&#8211;including records by Flight of the Conchords  and the Lonely Island&#8211;are because the songs are more than funny; they  are legitimately catchy. To successfully spoof any art form, you have to  understand its principles. The Lonely Island knows its stuff, and  peppers in enough guest stars to keep the album timely and relevant. Did  I mention these are just plain good songs? Sure, some are better than  others, but the stand-outs make the disc worth the listen.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Winehouse &#8211; <em>Lioness: Hidden Treasures</em></strong> &#8211; In a better world, this year&#8217;s list would include Amy&#8217;s second or third new album since her breakthrough <em>Back to Black</em>,  and I&#8217;d be raving about her continued genius. Sadly, we live in this  world, where Winehouse was unable to overcome debilitating addictions  that eventually took her life. So instead we&#8217;re left with bits and  pieces, fragments of what might have been. This is a great collection,  but its flavor is unquestionably bittersweet. Oh, what might have been.</p>
<p><strong>The Airborne Toxic Event &#8211; <em>All at Once</em> </strong>- After a solid  debut album a couple years back, the ATE returned with an even better  follow-up. The influences are quite varied, with some cuts sounding a  bit like Joy Division/early New Order while others are much more joyous  and relaxed. A great alternative pop record that isn&#8217;t ashamed to get  your feet tapping.</p>
<p><strong>EMA &#8211; <em>Past Life Martyred Saints</em></strong> &#8211; Critical darling EMA may  be a young PJ Harvey in the making. She&#8217;s not there yet, but Erika M.  Anderson has all the right ingredients: angst, edginess, and axes to  grind. Her debut solo album is loose enough to take the listener in a  lot of different directions; it will be interesting to see which path  EMA ventures down in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Apex Manor &#8211; <em>The Year of Magical Drinking</em></strong> &#8211; This was  one of the first albums I bought in 2011, and it remained a solid listen  all year long. Apex Manor veers from catchy indie pop to  Replacements-style raunchiness, all with a directness and charm that  feels absolutely genuine. Don&#8217;t let this album slip under your radar.</p>
<p><strong>The Decemberists &#8211; <em>The King is Dead</em></strong> &#8211; There are few  bands in the universe more charming than the Decemberists&#8211;seeing them  live even once will convince you of this. Yet their last couple records  have been a bit disappointing to me, trading the brilliant naivete of <em>Picaresque</em> for heavier-handed, over-produced material. <em>The King is Dead</em> is a return to form, focusing on catchy songs that tell great stories.  That&#8217;s exactly what I hope for from a Decemberists record.</p>
<p><strong>Foo Fighters &#8211; <em>Wasting Light</em></strong> &#8211; Despite Courtney Love&#8217;s  eternal ire, Foo Fighters have released some of the most solid and  dependable alternative/pop records of the last 15 years. Yet rarely have  they felt as well-crafted and complete as this year&#8217;s <em>Wasting Light</em>,  a project rich with the band&#8217;s penchant for catchy hooks and soaring  choruses. Whatever has fueled Dave Grohl&#8217;s ambitions, I hope he consumes  more of it, because this set is catchy and tight with nary a wasted  note. And having the legendary Bob Mould appear on the infectious &#8220;Dear  Rosemary&#8221; was a work of perfect pop genius.</p>
<p><strong>Gillian Welch &#8211; <em>The Harrow &amp; the Harvest</em> </strong>- Welch  has been around a long time, both as a solo artist and as a collaborator  with the likes of Ryan Adams, the Decemberists, and countless others.  Her latest effort is a charming folk/country affair that highlights what  she&#8217;s best at: writing great, moving songs. You&#8217;ll find no artifice  here, but plenty of direct, engaging art.</p>
<p><strong>Zola Jesus- <em>Conatus</em></strong> &#8211; Another relative newcomer, Nika Roza  Danilova blends goth, electronica, and a hint of prog into a layered  sound that belies her years. The sound is so thick in places that you  have to cut through it with a knife, but as you dig deeper you find more  and more that captivates. Treat this record like a treasure hunt or just let the music wash over you&#8211;your choice.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Love It &lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bon Iver &#8211; <em>Bon Iver</em></strong> &#8211; How do you follow up a record as iconic and intensely personal as 2008&#8217;s brilliant <em>For Emma, Forever Ago</em>?  In Bon Iver&#8217;s case, you maintain the emotional heart while expanding  upon the cabin-in-the-woods sound of the first album. This would be a  tricky act for anyone to pull off, but Justin Vernon and crew make it  sound effortless. The fuller production never gets in the way of songs  that just take hold and refuse to let go. Having cleared this sophomore  hurdle, the future is wide open for this band.</p>
<p><strong>Elbow &#8211; <em>Build a Rocket Boys!</em></strong> &#8211; If Elbow had no greater  ambitions than to be a Peter Gabriel cover band, they probably could  have made a pretty good living, since singer Guy Garvey has a rare  ability to match the former Genesis frontman&#8217;s range and tone with eerie  precision. Instead, thankfully, Elbow has opted to make clever and  challenging records that can appeal to the art-house crowd while still  blending into a post-Coldplay world. The songs range from soaring and  inspiring to gritty and burrowing, a balanced blend that conveys an  impressive range of talent.</p>
<p><strong>Brendan Perry &#8211; <em>Ark</em></strong><em> </em>- Maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s  been so long since the last Dead Can Dance record, but there is  something delightful about this album that was lacking on Perry&#8217;s first  solo effort, <em>Eye of the Hunter</em>. Sure, <em>Ark</em> is rich with  Perry&#8217;s signature mopey croon, and the lyrics still dance on the  precipice of pretentiousness, but there&#8217;s also a joyfulness and  immediacy to the songs that I find compelling. The usual array of exotic  instruments and sounds is here, but this time out it&#8217;s tempered by  layered synthesizers and danceable beats. Give this record a shot and  you could find something unexpectedly delightful.</p>
<p><strong>Cults &#8211; <em>Cults</em></strong><em> </em>- If, on first listen, you had  told me that this catchy wall-of-sound record was crafted in the 60s by  legendary producer and psychopath Phil Spector, I probably would have  believed you. But digging deeper uncovers a pop-punk sensibility that  brings this collection of crisp songs into the modern age. If you can  resist shaking your thang to this infectious album, I think there&#8217;s  probably something wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>Iron &amp; Wine &#8211; <em>Kiss Each Other Clean; Morning Becomes Eclectic</em></strong> &#8211;  I must confess that, if I had my druthers, I&#8217;d lock Sam Beam in a  room with an acoustic guitar and a four-track recorder and wouldn&#8217;t let  him out until he&#8217;d produced a handful of albums that sounded like the  epic and wonderful <em>Our Endless Numbered Days</em>. While <em>Kiss Each Other Clean</em> proves once again that Beam is as great a songwriter as anyone working  today, its dense production styles makes me long for the less refined  sound of his earlier efforts. The KCRW <em>Morning Becomes Eclectic</em> serves as a testament to the purity of the core songs, as the live  format really makes the material shine. At the risk of sounding like a  musical Luddite, I hope Iron &amp; Wine returns to a more stripped-down  sound in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Bush &#8211; <em>Director&#8217;s Cut; 50 Words for Snow</em></strong> &#8211; To describe Kate Bush as influential is  the greatest of  understatements; you need only look at many of the other acts on this  list to see plenty of examples of how much she has shaped a whole  generation of talent. Though prolific in her early years, she&#8217;s been  heartbreakingly quiet in the past decade plus. So when she released <em>Director&#8217;s Cut</em> earlier in the year, we had to assume that this collection of revised  cuts from two earlier albums would have to tie us over for a few years.  That wasn&#8217;t so bad, since the album brought some much-needed freshness  to some great songs that suffered from 1990s production values. Yet much  to my surprise, Kate was true to her claim that new music would be  coming soon by releasing <em>50 Words for Show</em> before the end of the  year. Despite the title, it&#8217;s not a Christmas album, although winter is  certainly a major thematic element. Instead of carols, you&#8217;ll find  Kate&#8217;s gorgeous voice delivering some lovely new songs, mostly featuring  piano and vocals. Though my favorite of her albums remains the epic <em>Hounds of Love</em>, the new effort has enough interesting twists to prove that Kate has what it takes to inspire yet another generation.</p>
<p><strong>David Sylvian &#8211; <em>Died in the Wool</em></strong><em> </em>- For an artist  who isn&#8217;t fond of looking back on previous work, Sylvian has been doing  a lot of it lately. With this collection, he turns his recent <em>Manafon </em>album  over to composer Dai Fujikura, who took the spare original tracks and  layered in classical arrangements. The strategy mostly works, though I  confess I enjoyed the open feeling of the original recordings in most  cases. Still, the new songs here are standouts, more than justifying the  existence of <em>Died in the Wool</em>.</p>
<p><strong>My Brightest Diamond &#8211; <em>All Things Will Unwind</em></strong> &#8211; Shara Worden has  covered a vast amount of musical ground with her My Brightest Diamond  project, blending elements of rock and pop and classical with her  amazingly distinct vocals. Her latest focuses more on the classical side  of things, but her lyrics&#8211;as well as the music itself&#8211;run the gamut  from thoughtful to playful. The newest album hasn&#8217;t gripped me quite as much as <em>A Thousand Shark&#8217;s Teeth</em>, but this is the kind of record that works its way slowly under your skin and makes the investment worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Gabriel &#8211; <em>New Blood</em></strong> &#8211; Oh look, another aging  artist records classical versions of his old hits. That&#8217;s a formula a  lot of listeners might opt to overlook, but don&#8217;t dismiss this effort so  quickly. As he&#8217;s done before, Gabriel takes what sounds like an old  idea and makes it interesting. There&#8217;s plenty of lush and lovely moments  like &#8220;In Your Eyes&#8221; and &#8220;Mercy Street&#8221;, but the first time I heard  &#8220;Intruder&#8221; I was driving home late on a foggy night and just about peed  my pants at the creepiness of it. Gabriel really did find a way to pump  some new blood into these songs, and the effort is well worth the  listen.</p>
<p><strong>Radiohead &#8211; <em>The King of Limbs; TKOL RMX 1234567</em></strong> &#8211; It was a busy year for Radiohead, with both a new record and a very worthwhile remix set released (they sneaked out a live  DVD as well). There&#8217;s no question the band remains hugely influential,  but are they still fresh and relevant? I say yes&#8211;the songs here are  just so damned compelling that you almost can&#8217;t help but be drawn in.  Radiohead somehow takes a modern sound and layers it with the feel of  jazz improv. It&#8217;s a siren&#8217;s call that consistently makes me want more.</p>
<p><strong>Wild Flag &#8211; <em>Wild Flag</em></strong> &#8211; Music remains inherently tied to image and artifice; that&#8217;s part of its charm as well as its detriment. So when a band comes along that eschews  image and focuses on the simple things that make rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll so great  and enduring, you just have to go with it. The gals of Wild Flag bring  with them an impressive indie rock pedigree, but all that would mean  nothing if the songs here weren&#8217;t so damned awesome. There&#8217;s no fakery  or posing to be found here; simply put, they will rock the shit out of  you. And I think that&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Gotta Have It &lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fleet Foxes &#8211; <em>Helplessness Blues</em></strong> &#8211; After a fantastic  debut album, a group has nowhere to go but down on the next one, right?  In the case of Fleet Foxes, that assumption couldn&#8217;t be more wrong.  Somehow the band manages yet another collection of rousing, touching  songs with vocal harmonies that seem almost impossibly surreal&#8211;like  they come from some other planet. <em>Helplessness Blues</em> has a timeless quality that is both classic and modern. Don&#8217;t question it; just listen.</p>
<p><strong>The Knux &#8211; <em>Eraser</em></strong><em> </em>- On this ridiculously catchy  record, the Knux effortlessly blend hip-hop with the purest pop-punk  sensibility. There is nothing wasted here&#8211;just three chords, catchy  beats, and hooks galore. If it weren&#8217;t for the foul language  necessitating a warning sticker, this album could (and should) have been  all over the radio. I defy you to listen to these songs without tapping  your toes at the very least. More than likely, you&#8217;ll be shaking what  the good lore gave ya.</p>
<p><strong>Florence + the Machine &#8211; <em>Ceremonials</em></strong><em> </em>- At the  risk of repeating myself, here&#8217;s another act that had the potential to  flounder a follow-up to a hugely successful first record, yet managed to  knock it out of the park. <em>Ceremonials</em> takes the best of what  went before and kicks it up a notch. The beats are bigger, the anthems  more anthemic, and the soaring vocals simply rocket out of the  stratosphere. Florence is an artist who, instead of sliding by on past  popularity, took what she&#8217;d earned and poured 100% of it back into her  craft. An amazing album.</p>
<p><strong>TV On the Radio &#8211; <em>Nine Types of Light</em></strong> &#8211; This is another  band that&#8217;s hard to categorize thanks to their effortless blending of  varied musical styles. Yet nothing feels forced or unnatural here; the  band has perfected its own sound that simply works. Underneath it all  are solid songs that rock when they should and are poignant when they  need to be. This album covers an expanse of musical ground, yet it all  just feels right. What a great band.</p>
<p><strong>The Black Keys &#8211; <em>El Camino</em></strong> &#8211; On another collaboration with producer Danger Mouse, the Black Keys deliver their signature blend of blues, funk, and 70s power rock&#8211;this time with a somewhat greater emphasis on the latter. Why change a formula that works? Their songs are catchy and fun, with sexy grooves that conjure Bad Company and even Led Zeppelin in their heyday. The Keys aren&#8217;t reinventing the wheel here, but they have honed their craft and are writing the best songs of their career. This is a great album.</p>
<p><strong>PJ Harvey &#8211; <em>Let England Shake</em></strong> &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure if PJ has  been listening to a Matt Johnson marathon, but not since The The&#8217;s  classic albums of the late 80s/early 90s has there been so crisp and  direct a musical criticism of the UK&#8217;s politics and customs. Harvey has  never sounded better, somehow staying absolutely fresh and vital. Proof  that great songs can be both instantly catchy and thought-provokingly  deep. Runner-up for my album of the year.</p>
<p><strong>The Civil Wars &#8211; <em>Barton Hollow</em></strong> &#8211; Once in a while a band comes along that sounds like it&#8217;s been together for a thousand years, where everything they do sounds inherent to their very being, with nothing forced or unnatural. The Civil Wars are such a group. The songs on <em>Barton Hollow</em> are instantly gripping and mesmerizing, rising above a folk/country/pop crowd in effortless and ethereal fashion. Every piece on this record is like a soundtrack to its own film, gripping and personal and haunting. This is one of those records that fills you with wistfulness, longing, and just about every kind of emotion. Throughout the year, this is the one I&#8217;ve come back to time and time again. My record of the year.</p>
