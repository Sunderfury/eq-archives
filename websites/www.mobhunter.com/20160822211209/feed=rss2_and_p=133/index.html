		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I&#039;m pretty much under the assmption that Tony is dead. Everything adds up really well. When I saw the flashback to the boat scene, something started nagging at me about it but I got lost in the rest of the episode and let it slip away.

The more I think about it, I feel it was really well done. I like endings that aren&#039;t completely spelled out for me, so long as enough clues and consistency are there to give me something to fill in the blanks myself. I think in this case, we were given ample context to make that last ten seconds of the episode meaningful.]]></description>

Come to think of it, that earlier episode discussing the &quot;everything goes black&quot; made me think of GoodFellas, when Ray Liotta&#039;s character is arrested in his driveway:

Henry Hill: &quot;For a second I thought I was dead. But, when I heard all the noise I knew they were cops. Only cops talk that way. If they&#039;d been wiseguys I wouldn&#039;t have heard a thing. I would&#039;ve been dead.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m amused at how &quot;pissed off&quot; people were at the ending of Sopranos (it&#039;s a tv show, cmon people). I personally thought it was pretty ingenius.
I&#039;m even more amused that you created a two-paragraph blog that somehow incorporates hiring an artist, reality show dance contests, and the Sopranos without batting an eye.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A former roommate of mine from college was on &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; in the first season.  He received comments from the judges ranging from &quot;you must be fun to watch at the clubs&quot; to &quot;I thought it was a bit spazzy&quot;.  

He looked heartbroken when he heard it all, and I swear he had tears in his eyes, but he gave his props and then headed off to backstage without any real drama at all.  

If you remember him, it was Tony Peltier.  Good guy.  But yeah, he dances slightly spazzy.  (But yes, he was fun to watch at the clubs, too)  ;)]]></description>
