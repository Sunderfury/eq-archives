May also reduce the &quot;hitch&quot; when other players zone in, though it probably won't remove it completely<p>- May reduce the cases where some players experience a performance reduction after being in a zone for a while<p>- Fixed a bug that was causing some portions of spell effects and the &quot;bolts&quot; in bolts spells to not show up.<p>- Generally improve stability.<p>How these changes affect individuals will vary, but we hope that this will improve game performance a bit over all.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>Ah, finally, some news we can sink our Coterie fangs into: the promise of increased performance!<p>Someone at Verant just read that sentence and panicked. &quot;Gah! We didn't promise anything! GAH!&quot; Oh, but surely we all know that anything stated in a patch message or on the EQ Forums is considered a blood oath by the unwashed masses of EverQuest players--and one has only to attend a FanFaire to know how true that &quot;unwashed&quot; statement is. So, does this patch stand up to the inflated hopes we all have?<p>I didn't have a lot of time to test things last night, but I'll share my findings so far. Once again, I'm running a 1gHz Athlon, 768 megs RAM, and a GeForce 3.<p>Logging in inside Fungus Grove, I ran from FG==&gt;TS==&gt;Katta==&gt;TM==&gt;GF==&gt;Acrylia. Without a doubt, my zoning times decreased noticably. And while I didn't measure <a href="http://www.fraps.com/">framerates</a>, it did seem that I was getting a slight improvement. Katta in particular seemed faster, but then it might have been because I was the sole person in the whole zone. (On a side note, I hope I'm not the only one who thinks there should be a little more intra-Luclin teleportation available. Seeing a beautiful zone like Katta go to waste simply because it's so far out of the way is a real shame.)<p>No, there wasn't a night-and-day difference in performance, and I'm probably a fool to dream that one day I'll log in and the graphics will suddenly be zippy. All the more reason to keep eyeing a CPU upgrade, I suppose, though I think the notion of having to beef up my computer again for this silly game is somewhat <a href="http://www.modernhumorist.com/mh/0201/ray/">absurd</a>.<p>The line in the patch message I find most interesting is that it &quot;May reduce the cases where some players experience a performance reduction after being in a zone for a while.&quot; Personally, I find that performance generally <I>increases</I> the longer I'm in a zone--especially Fungus Grove, for some reason. Then again, that may be because I've spent some sickeningly long stretches in FG killing those damned mushrooms.<p>Anyway, please post your results as to whether the patch did any good for you, and be sure to include a little data on your system. I'm curious whether this patch was geared more towards the AMD problems or whether performance on the Intel chips increased as well.
