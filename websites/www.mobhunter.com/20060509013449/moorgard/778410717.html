<html><head><title>Reader Mail</title></head><body><h1>Reader Mail</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-01-09</p>Okay, so this isn't the most original concept in the universe. Readers send in questions, we answer them. Yawn.<p>But hey, Absor makes a living doing it, so why not us? If nothing else, it should give those of you who think I'm <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=1098977988&amp;msgid=-1230586752#message">applying for a job</a> a little fuel for the fire.<p>Since I'm catching those who sent in letters off guard (you didn't expect your questions to show up on the site, did ya?), I won't use full names. In the future, please include a character name if you send in a question.<p>The first question comes from Chris:<p><B>I'm wondering if you know anything about when a new regular server might be released, not like FV or PVP servers but a real new one.....</B><p>I have absolutely no idea when a new server might come online, but I don't expect any for quite some time--if ever. With the addition of the Luclin expansion, there are so many zones now that even high-level players can afford to stretch out a bit. In the days when 1/4 of the player base could be found in Lower Guk and SolB (and later, Sebilis and Karnor's Castle), it made sense to add new servers. But with Velk's Lab, Chardok, Howling Stones, Fungus Grove, Maiden's Eye, and other zones available, players have lots of elbow room. Zones simply aren't overcrowded anymore--for the most part.<p>EverQuest's subscriber base would probably have to increase substantially for us to see brand new servers coming up. I don't expect that will happen for a while, unless a split server comes into play.<p>Next question:<p><B>Moorgard,<p>I have no idea if you can help me or not. Over the last month I've been trying to get a answer from VI to a very simple question, but I have never received any response whatsoever. I have contacted GM's, email, the forum, everything and not received the slightest notification that I have been heard.<p>As a last attempt I thought that just maybe you would know someone you can talk to direct at VI that can provide a answer. Hell it's worth a try, right?<p>The question? &quot;When will the Character Transfer Service become active again&quot;?<p>At the start of the launch of SoL they took it down for two weeks, it's now six weeks away and the web site still only mentions the original two weeks.<p>Any help you can provide would be most welcome.<p>Thanks<p>Logansan<br>58 Paladin Xev</B><p>I wish we had someone at Verant in our back pocket, but unfortunately we have to scrounge for our answers just like the rest of you do (we just have more time and resources to be able to do it). My speculation is that, with the fourth-quarter coffers overflowing thanks to Luclin sales, Verant is more concerned with keeping those customers happy--and gaining new ones--by ironing out problems with the expansion. While I'm sure they want your $50, moving characters isn't on top of their list right now.<p>Hopefully one of our readers at Verant will see this and light a fire under the appropriate ash can.<p>Our final question for this inaugural edition of Mobhunter Mailbag is a doosy:<p><B>Moorgard,<br> <br>Why does Verant insist on leaving out /curtsey?  This is a HUGE mistake for anyone claiming to be a role playing game that allows you to play a female.  I have seen that Verant recently added /nudge, and other emotes that should NOT come before creating the ability for a woman to be proper.  This bothers me.  <br> <br>I have submitted many requests through e-mail and the EQ developer forum, and have NEVER seen, or heard of anything.  So I started a post in the Newbie forum to see what other people thought.  I was sure to mention that EQs competition has this /emote, even though I named nothing specific.  The thread was locked after only 8 posts.  <br> <br>I am beginning to think that there are a few reasons for the thread being locked, and this request going undone, and ignored for so darn long.  They include:<p>- Verant not caring. <br>- No Verant employees know what a curtsey is, and have no girlfriends to ask. <br>- Verant not having a talented enough artist to pull it off.<p>More seriously:<p>- That there is no distinction between male and female characters in EQ, and Verant would rather make it a male only &quot;emote&quot; world since they screwed up and never made the sex thing a role playing factor.  (This is why all NPCs call you a that, this and them, instead of him or her.  It just doesn't know!) <br>- It is already in development, and they don't want to spoil it.  (Yeah, right!)<p>I am sure that this post got locked because it looked as if the public was agreeing with me, and it would soon become VERY evident that EverQuest is a game that simply forgot the female, unless you are referring to the gargantuan breasts that the female characters seem to have.  (My Gnome Enchantress wears a helmet and wrist guards because she falls over forward all too often now...)  I have included a link to this post.  I would start another one, however, I don't want to get banned, for showing Verant seems to have a lack of respect toward real life females or female characters.<br> <br>What do you think?  It seems that us little EverQuest subscribers just get warnings when we make a good point, but you EverQuest web operators get a response back because Verant becomes worried about a tarnished image.  With this on the table, please use your leverage to help us female, and female character playing people do more then bow, allow us to be proper women!<br> <br>(I am beginning to think that there is no curtsey, and only a bow because Sony thinks it should be that way...  What is next?  No female character will be allowed to walk closer then 2 steps behind any male character in the game?)<br> <br>Link to locked post:<br> <br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/014851.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/014851.html</a><br> <br>Quala Kai of the Guild Amazons (A female only guild)<br>Level 52 Enchantress<br>Vallon Zek</B><p>Now that's a pretty good point. Sure, EverQuest is largely one big boy's club, but we shouldn't neglect the ladies out there--even the ones being played by fellas.<p>I'd love to see high elves curtsey. It seems like just the kind of formal thing they'd do. Erudites--maybe, though they might think themselves beneath such common ritual. I could see a dark elf wizard wanting to curtsey--just before she casts ice comet on you. For wood elves and barbarian women it might not make a lot of sense, being wild outdoorsy types and all, but I'm not sure if Verant can make emotes that are specific to race or gender.<p>Then again, why shouldn't males be allowed to curtsey? The sexes are equal, right? Besides, don't tell me a male high elf enchanter doesn't look attractive in a robe. He should be allowed to feel pretty and curtsey if he wants to.<p>So how about it, Verant? Add /curtsey to the game. If nothing else, you'll be making your female players happy.<p>That's it for the first edition of Mobhunter Mailbag. Notice how I didn't have any actual answers to the questions asked? Luckily for you, I speculate for free. So keep those questions <a href="mailto:support@mobhunter.com">coming in</a>, and we'll answer them periodically.
