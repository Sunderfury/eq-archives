			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s <a title="And it's flame free!" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/37038-favorite-mmorpg-weapon-item.html" target="_blank">a great thread</a> over at Fires of Heaven asking posters to list their favorite weapons and armor from any MMOG. Not surprisingly, the original EverQuest dominates the list.</p>
<p>Partly this is because the FoH board has its roots firmly in EQ, but there&#8217;s more to it than that. EverQuest had memorable items because, at least in the early days, it had no rules. Modern MMOGs like WoW and EQ2 have pretty strict item creation guidelines which give designers a set budget to spend when creating weapons and armor. Sure, the high-end game has great loot with effects that make you drool over them, but there are very few that stand out as truly unique or indispensable. They simply hold you over until the next level cap increase, when even the uberest of loot will be replaced.</p>
<p>EQ also started with no level restrictions on items. This had the interesting effect that there was no stigma associated with wearing an item you got at level 30 when you were level 50. Many of the most desirable items were hard to get because they came from rare spawns, not necessarily because they were raid drops or from the highest-level dungeons.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s game designers will tell you that original EQ&#8217;s itemization was broken. You want players to feel like they&#8217;re making steady progress, leaving old gear behind while shooting for the new stuff. But broken or not, no other MMOG has made me put as much time into planning my gear as EQ did. I had a three-ring binder full of printouts listing items I longed to get. While I do pay attention to certain gear in WoW, it&#8217;s really only raid drops that are worth paying attention to. As far as regular gear goes, you can pick up stuff you need as you quest, level grind, or PvP.</p>
<p>Modern itemization is technically &#8220;better&#8221; in that it is balanced and offers measurable progress. But there is an undeniable magic to items that break the rules and really stand out in players&#8217; hearts and minds. It may be true that there will never be another major MMOG that features the Wild West itemization of old EQ. But maybe, just maybe, there will be games that break the rules every so often and create some gear that remains memorable.</p>
<p>Oh, and my vote? Gotta be the Shroud of Longevity and Celestial Fists, because obtaining those two items alongside my guildmates gave me the greatest sense of accomplishment in any MMOG I&#8217;ve played. Although I have to give props to the Flowing Black Silk Sash and the Hero Bracers (the latter which I farmedÂ  incessantly so that I could afford the former), and the original granddaddy of raid loot: the Cloak of Flames.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like so many others, I have been lured by the call of the Lich King. After drifting off into AoC and WAR for a while, one appreciates just how polished and solid the act of playing WoW is. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s perfect; rather, I mean the fact that there usually aren&#8217;t stupid little annoyances that gnaw away at your urge to play like so many rabid chipmunks.</p>
<p>My main in WoW has been an undead warrior, a character of which I&#8217;ve never been especially fond. As a DPS build, I pretended he was a monk in order to get through the day. As an undead, I pretended he used to be an attractive human (unlike the human models in WoW, which I can&#8217;t stand). You might guess based upon my general malaise that I was a prime candidate to try out the death knight, and you&#8217;d be right.</p>
<p>General impressions and a couple spoilers after the break.<span id="more-376"></span></p>
<p>First off, the death knight intro quests are cooler than anything that I&#8217;ve seen in WoW (or most any MMOG) so far. Built upon their phasing technology, you move back and forth through the zone and see real changes based on the quests you&#8217;ve done. That&#8217;s extremely awesome!</p>
<p>Secondly, the armor that you get looks absolutely badass. I made a blood elf male DK and am completely sold on how he looks. Extra awesome!</p>
<p>Thirdly, the death knight cuts through mobs like a hot knife through butter. There&#8217;s something scandalously appealing about a class that makes you feel like you&#8217;re exploiting the system just by playing it. You can just about mash random buttons and be extremely successful. Super duper awesome!</p>
<p>However, there are negatives that go along with each of these positives. Here&#8217;s where the spoilers come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>After playing through all these cool, dynamic, zone-changing quests, you get dumped into the static, never-changing Outland. Ugh! Give me one freaking 60-70 zone in Wrath so I don&#8217;t have to relive this grind!</li>
<li>The quest line builds up the notion that you really don&#8217;t want to be working for mean old Arthas. You can almost taste your betrayal moment coming&#8230; except it doesn&#8217;t. Instead, your boss decides that he will no longer work for the Lich King, so now you won&#8217;t be working for him either. How rebellious of you&#8211;not!</li>
<li>That awesome DK armor? Yeah, prepare to trade it in for a clown suit as you level through Outland. Personally, I&#8217;m determined to wear my quest gear until I absolutely can&#8217;t anymore, but even so it&#8217;s a bummer to lose out on that badass look. Blizzard, give us vanity slots already!</li>
</ul>
<p>The only saving grace with playing through Outland again is that the overpowered death knight completes quests so much faster than characters did the first time around (especially compared to my cumbersome warrior). Besides just killing quickly, you also get a fast horse with access to a talent that increases your speed to godlike levels. It should take far less time to get to a reasonable level in the BC zones, at which point you can jump over to Wrath and get to the new stuff.</p>
<p>Will the death knight be my new main character? In all likelihood, yes. I already feel more of a personal connection to it than I did to my undead warrior, and the class is just plain fun to play. You can&#8217;t throw a rock in Outland without hitting a dozen death knights, and I&#8217;m sure there will be even more people trying them out once they get their main characters to 80.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a raider or a soloer or anywhere in between, I recommend playing through the death knight starting experience at least once. It features some of the best quests in WoW so far and leaves you with a very intriguing new character to play around with. As for yours truly, you will find me in Outland for a while, but eventually Moordeth will be making his way to the frozen north.</p>
<p>After all, I owe Arthas a visit.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not going to tell you who to vote for. Frankly, you shouldn&#8217;t be looking for political advice on a gaming blog.</p>
<p>But this is an important election, one that will directly shape the future of the next decade. Issues will be decided in the coming years that will affect America&#8217;s economic and strategic place in the world. This is big stuff.</p>
<p>It falls upon all of us to exercise our right and make informed decisions in the upcoming election. That means looking beyond who has the smoothest soundbites or who does the more convincing job of slamming his opponent and focusing on which candidate you believe will best lead us to a prosperous future.</p>
<p>One great thing about the presidential race is that, unlike some recent elections, I think both candidates are good men who sincerely care about their country and its people. They differ greatly on how they think we should go about fixing what is broken, but neither is completely right nor completely wrong; if that were the case, there wouldn&#8217;t be so many intelligent people on both sides of the political aisle.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave decisions like this in someone else&#8217;s hands. Too many good people have fought and died to give us the opportunity that so many take for granted on election day. Don&#8217;t be one of those sad statistics. Invest the effort into examining the issues and taking a hard look at where you stand. Your voice only counts if you use it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be stupid. Vote.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The BioWare Austin folks are talking a lot about Star Wars: The Old Republic. And they should, because it&#8217;s without question one of the most anticipated MMOGs on the horizon, thanks in no small part to BioWare&#8217;s reputation for making quality games.</p>
<p>Besides meditating on <a title="The Force was REALLY generous to this one" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/47423" target="_blank">the size of one&#8217;s lightsaber</a>, a major point of emphasis that the devs focus on is the role of the player as hero. For instance, the lead writer discusses <a title="That's a mighty big slug" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/10/24/the-old-republic-unveiled-leveling-sidekicking-and-questing/" target="_blank">making the player feel heroic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daniel Erickson, Lead Writer BioWare Austin:</span> The k&#8217;lor&#8217;slug is 20 feet tall, and horrible, and can eat your face &#8230; and that&#8217;s what you fight at level one as a Sith. The first thing you ever fight in the game is that thing. And you never do anything less heroic than that. There are no bunnies, no rabbits, no snakes &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>A noble goal, that of relieving players of the burden of killing all those tens of rats. This has caused many to consider the role of the hero, including <a title="Link to a lesser blog" href="http://38pitches.com/2008/10/24/mmo-design-and-development/" target="_blank">some folks I happen to know</a>. But while I agree with the general goal of making the player feel heroic, there&#8217;s a lot more to it than just the type of creatures they fight.<span id="more-369"></span></p>
<p>Players feel awesome for a variety of reasons in MMOGs. There is a distinction between making someone feel like a hero, giving them a sense of accomplishment, or making them feel like a badass.</p>
<p><strong>The Hero</strong></p>
<p>Heroes are extraordinary people who do amazing things that the average person can&#8217;t. Traditionally this has been a rather weak area in MMOGs, simply because of the very properties of the game.</p>
<p>A quest giver may beg your character to fight back the orcs that threaten his village, which seems a worthy task for a hero. But sooner or later you realize that if you don&#8217;t fight back the orcs, someone else will. Worse yet, killing a certain number of orcs may complete your quest, but the orcs just respawn and threaten the village again. in order to feel like a hero, the game needs to give consequences for your actions or the lack thereof.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario instead. The village is being overrun by orcs, and if the players don&#8217;t successfully defend the village against incursion over the course of the invasion, the villagers will be driven out and orcs take over. All of a sudden the player&#8217;s choice becomes meaningful; they can see an outcome based upon their actions or inactions, and their world is changed as a result.</p>
<p>Scenarios like this are one-time-use bits of content, and as such are usually regarded as too expensive for MMOG makers to undertake except in rare circumstances. But the games that really want to play up the role of the hero will find ways to make the investment. Without it, heroism in these games will continue to feel shallow.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishments</strong></p>
<p>Making the player feel they accomplished something worthwhile with their time is different than making them feel like a hero, but is just as rewarding. Such moments become even more memorable if the player feels like these goals were set by themselves rather than having them dictated to them.</p>
<p>The run from Freeport to Qeynos is a good example. Nobody gave you a quest at level one to make this journey, but staring at the EverQuest world map inspired many players to make the trip. Those who survived, especially after suffering wrong turns and horrific deaths, had a story they tell with relish to this day.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; achievements like those recently introduced by WoW are cool. But they don&#8217;t compare to the adventures players undertake on their own, for no other reason than to see what happens. Game designers inspire these accomplishments by making a game world with enough depth to allow players to tell their own stories and imagine their own adventures.</p>
<p><strong>Being the Badass</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re serving a greater cause or helping your fellow man. Sometimes you just want to smash stuff in the face.</p>
<p>A surefire way to engage players is to allow them to unleash carnage. Drop them in a room full of zombies with a machine gun (or a katana, or a chainsaw) and let them go to town. Few things feel as gratifying in a video game as mowing through a sea of opponents and coming out the other end bathed in the blood of your fallen enemies.</p>
<p>This feeling can be tied to heroic acts, but doesn&#8217;t have to be. The Harclave buff in EQ2 is a great example of making the player feel like a badass. With that buff, the player cuts a swath through a dungeon teeming with group mobs that don&#8217;t stand a chance. In fact, it&#8217;s just about impossible for the player to die. People played through this Splitpaw dungeon over and over again because it felt so freaking fun.</p>
<p><strong>Balance is Key</strong></p>
<p>Storytelling is about rising and falling action. You can&#8217;t just crank the volume up to eleven and expect to sustain that buzz indefinitely. For the heroic and badass moments to have significance, you also need quieter moments of reflection to consider what you&#8217;ve accomplished.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say you need to give players boring crap to do, but MMOGs are about more than chopping up opponents non-stop. One of the great social elements of EQ was the downtime between fights, which allowed players to bullshit with one another while ramping up for the next encounter. Though EQ took downtime to extremes, the complete lack of it in other games has had a palpable effect upon the way they build lasting communities.</p>
<p>So while the goal of never giving players a less imposing nemesis than a 20-foot slug is cool, that&#8217;s certainly not the only way to inspire feelings of heroism in your player base. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on what made you feel like a hero or a badass, or what kinds of accomplishments you felt most proud of in your MMOG career.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow.</p>
<p>An obvious exclamation to use after returning from BlizzCon, but it fits. This was an amazing event in so many ways. Anyone savvy enough to find this blog doesn&#8217;t need me to point to the multitude of links recapping the show (Massively alone wrote like a hundred articles), but suffice it to say that Blizzard has applied their usual polish and class to this event. Knowing the massive undertaking required to put on an SOE FanFaire, I am stunned by the effort it took to pull off BlizzCon. In ways it reminded me of the excitement and energy of the E3 of old, without most of the excess and eventual decadence.</p>
<p>After standing in line about a half hour I even got to play Diablo 3, and let me assure you that it rocks.</p>
<p>I must admit, the frenzy of BlizzCon and the launch of the 3.0 patch has me in a quandary as to whether I should return to WoW now or wait for Wrath in a month. I&#8217;d like a little time to get to know my class again (since they basically rewrote the talents of just about everybody), but I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;d actually <strong><em>do </em></strong>in the game. I don&#8217;t want to roll an alt, and any gear I&#8217;d acquire on my main will be instantly obsolete in Northrend. I suppose I could try to make enough cash to finally get my epic flier, but I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s enough to keep me interested.</p>
<p>This dilemma is partly fueled by the fact that my playtime in WAR has been dragging a bit lately. After exhausting the tier 2 content in chaos, I ran through the dark elf area. I feel the quest design and populationÂ  leave a little to be desired, and I&#8217;ve found myself frustrated more often than entertained. I still find the marauder much more to my taste than WoW&#8217;s warrior, so I&#8217;m not sure what I want to do yet.</p>
<p>Hey, it&#8217;s good to have options at least!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday I&#8217;m making the cross-country flight to California to attend <a title="As if they need me to pimp this event" href="http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon/?rhtml=y" target="_blank">BlizzCon 2008</a>. A couple of us from 38 Studios will be there in relation to a project called <a href="http://www.azerothadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Azeroth Advisor</a> which you may have <a href="http://www.massively.com/2008/10/03/38-studios-acquires-mmo-newsletter-tailored-to-player-characters/" target="_blank">caught wind about</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be walking the show floor, chatting with gamers and soaking in the sights. And yeah, we&#8217;ll be taking notes so that one day when we have Copernicus fan events, they will be just as exciting as BlizzCon.</p>
<p>Oh, and I want that polar bear!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again: I much prefer fan events over industry gatherings. There is no substitute for meeting players face to face&#8211;even if they&#8217;re not players of a game I&#8217;m working on. So if you see a couple geeks wandering around in 38 Studios gear, be sure to say hello.</p>
<p>Edit: <a title="Wizards. Cyborgs." href="http://www.azerothadvisor.com/public/media" target="_blank">These videos</a> tell you everything you want to know about the Azeroth Advisor newsletter. And more.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The blokes at Rock, Paper, Shotgun posted <a title="*giggle*" href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/10/01/understanding-pc-games-acronyms/#more-3630" target="_blank">a list of PC gaming acronyms</a> packed with several chuckles. The one that made me laugh out loud was the definition of RPG:</p>
<blockquote><p>While many games ask you to play a role, the only ones that earn this title are those that ask you to play a role that would socially ostracise you if other people found out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, good stuff.</p>
