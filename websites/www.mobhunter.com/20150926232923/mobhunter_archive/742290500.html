Somebody explain to me what the deal is with the recently butch Firiona Vie riding around on <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/screenshots/index.asp?id=3412">horseback</a>? By the time Luclin comes out, we expect her to be sporting a full-blown <a href="http://www.pigeonfun.com/mulletpix/randomarchive/archive2/mullet01.jpg">mullet</a> while wearing an Indigo Girls t-shirt.<p>Of greater interest is the <a href="http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/previews/sep01/luclin.html">interview</a> conducted by GamesDomain with Verant's Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler. Read the whole thing; it's well done.<p>Our favorite excerpts, as always:<p><B>Similar to the most recent expansion, Scars of Velious, Luclin will feature three factions, between which players are free to choose. Unlike Velious, in which the factions were a natural progression, each one more powerful than the others, the three Luclin factions -- Vah'Shir (cat-people), good combine empire and evil combine empire -- will supposedly be equal in power and reward. Again all three cities will be a combined town/dungeon, where players can hunt as well as quest, trade, and set up as a home base. <p>In general, the zones won't be as huge as those in previous expansions, an aim being to hopefully increase their accessibility to players. However amongst the improvements planned for the expansion was a massive increase to the clipping plane, to over 1 mile in-game distance. It was admitted, however, that with the new clipping plane out to maximum, there was no computer on the market that would be able to run many of the zones in Shadows of Luclin.<p>...<p>GD: There are rumours of a new communication system to be included with Shadows of Luclin -- a more raid-friendly communications system -- any truth in them? <p>BM: That's not necessarily going to be associated with Luclin. That kind of enhancement or additional functionality is to be patched in over time. We don't have a solid timeframe on that yet - probably, realistically soon after Luclin since we're still busy working on Luclin at this time. But it is a future plan - linking groups together into larger multi-groups to facilitate communication on a raid. <p>JB: In addition to that, we're planning the ability to separate your chat channels into separate windows. For instance, you can have your combat chat in one separate window, your guild chat in another; these would be independently sizeable and moveable around your screen, so you can give emphasis to tells, or whatever. <p>BM: Yeah, it's one of the infrastructures that'll be going in, probably right around Luclin that we're going to build on. We're continuing to build on with evolving the user interface. It changed around Velious, and got a lot better, resolution independent. Now we're going into the next step - we're going to start recording multi-language, multi-character sets, as Jeff noted, filtering chat into different windows, make it a much more flexible experience. We're doing a lot of things, not just with the interface, but with Luclin in general, as you'll see. Because these games are around for two, three or four years, you need to keep them up to date with technology - back when we designed Everquest, we had no idea it would be exceeding resolutions of 640x480. Voodoo 1 was just coming out, we have to go back periodically and revisit the technology and the interface, the graphic options, things like that.<p>...<p>GD: Ok, another question: If you could make Everquest again, what would you do differently? To put it in context, when we asked Gordon Walton (Ultima Online) the same question he said he'd rather put five million dollars on the floor and burn it right there and then, than make it again. <p>BM: Really? Wow! No way, I'd love to make Everquest again. And you never know what we're working on in the future -, Sony Online is extremely committed to massively multiplayer games.</B> <I>[Editor's Note: I really just put this quote in because I love what Walton said about UO. Hehehehe.]</I><p>Like I said, just read the whole thing. There are hints about the future of the EverQuest franchise, a dicussion on evil Combine pancakes, and some reflection on the means of communicating with the players.<p>Any other big computer game shows coming up before Luclin ships?
