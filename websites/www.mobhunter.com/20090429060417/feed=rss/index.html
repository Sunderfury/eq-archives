		<title>Just Another Valueless Blog Post</title>
		<description>Cuppy raises what she assumes will be controversial questions about game design bloggers: Do they know what they're talking about? Are they even good designers?

Where's the controversy? The answer to both questions is "Play it safe and assume not."

Which makes you wonder whether I know what I'm talking about or ...</description>

		<title>You Beta You Beta You Bet</title>
		<description>There's a pretty good article over on Ten Ton Hammer offering a look at the current state of beta testing. As many others have noted, not much testing goes on in the public stages of MMO betas, and the article offers a variety of perspectives from both developers and players.

		<title>Spam: the New Poetry</title>
		<description>Have you ever actually browsed your junk email folder? Sure, there's nasty virus-laden stuff you need to watch out for, but some spammers are including a wealth of inspired writing in their messages that a student of modern poetry can't help but find captivating.

Check out this gem, found in a ...</description>

		<title>Broken Toys: Size Doesn&#8217;t Matter</title>
		<description>Lum posted articles about two GDC talks, one by Mythic's Paul Barnett and the other by Blizzard's Jeff Kaplan. While the articles themselves are interesting, I found the comments sections even more enlightening.

In the former, you have a number of commenters saying what a blowhard Paul is, some of them ...</description>

		<title>Buy My Book, Please</title>
		<description>Okay, it's not technically my book per se, but I did coauthor a chapter with my old (and I do mean old) comrade, Tracy "Owlchick" Seamster. The book is called Writing for Video Game Genres: From FPS to RPG, and its contributors come from the Writers SIG of the IGDA. ...</description>

		<title>Galactica: It Is Accomplished</title>
		<description>Battlestar Galactica's finale has aired. It didn't answer every question we had, but it resolved most of them. Perhaps more importantly, it gave us closure for the characters we've come to care about over the past five or so years.

Plenty o' spoilers after the break.

I am pleased with how they ...</description>

		<title>Happy Birthday, EverQuest!</title>
		<description>Ten years ago today, a game launched that would have a huge impact on my life in more ways that I can count. It was a big, beautiful, maddeningly imperfect game that would become an obsession. But more than anything, it gave me countless hours of fun.

Thanks to everyone who ...</description>

		<title>A Discipline Without History</title>
		<description>On RPG Vault, FusionFall's Rich Weil outlines a lot of the reasons community management is a much more nebulous position in online gaming than many other development roles. Lum (honorary community manager) and Sanya discuss the article and agree with most of what Rich says, and there's not much in ...</description>

		<title>In Retrospect, My Day Wasn&#8217;t So Bad</title>
