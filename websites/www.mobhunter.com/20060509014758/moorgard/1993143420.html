We'll be catching up on most of the code changes we haven't been able to make lately, so we're anticipating that there will be a need to bring up the servers, check them out, then bring them back down for polishing and perhaps a bit more feed for the hamsters.</B><p>This is the patch with the major changes to the storage systems for guild data and other critical stuff. Verant delayed patching any code changes because they wanted to be as sure as possible that the new junk works--because we all know what would happen if our character data is screwed in any way. Picture villagers with pitchforks and torches storming the Verant castle.<p>Because the data structures will be patched, lots of code-based bugs that were on hold can finally be fixed, so we can expect issues like the complete heal bug to go away. I also heard a rumor that Verant will be introducing some top-secret <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20020501/ap_on_sc/remote_controlled_rats_2">new technology</a> to make clerics function better... but that's just a rumor.<p><BIG>Caught in Your Web</BIG><p>Hammerfel's design team was busy yesterday, scrambling to get the new <a href="http://everquest2.station.sony.com/index.jsp">EverQuest 2</a> and the revamped <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/">EverQuest Live</a> sites up and running.<p>The new EQ Live looks much better than the old one, and seems to load a bit faster on the crappy machine I use at work. There are probably a few dozen of those silly Easter eggs hidden about, but I'll be damned if I'm going to trace my mouse around every page looking for them!<p>The EQ2 site is well worth exploring, despite its obviously sparse current content. Hey, the game is 18 months off, what do you expect? Besides some killer screen shots (um, is that picture of the castle <I>really</I> a screen shot?), there is a very interesting <a href="http://everquest2.station.sony.com/letter.jsp">letter</a> from John Smedley. You should read the whole thing, but here are the highlights:<p><B>We plan on keeping EverQuest running for a long time to come, and those plans include adding more and more features into the game as well as future expansions. In the near term, you can look forward to a completely revamped interface. This interface is going to dramatically change the way people play EverQuest. We're getting rid of the old framed full-screen interface and replacing the entire thing with an extremely modifiable set of windows. Users will be able to customize the interface with their own artwork, and decide for themselves what they want on the screen... including things like the Experience Bar and a pet health indicator. We're also adding in all kinds of new abilities such as launching separate chat windows and simple inventory control. In addition to the interface, you'll also see an all-new particle system that will allow for some spectacular spell effects. We plan on enhancing EverQuest for a long time to come, not letting it grow stale. A lot of people have invested an incredible amount of time in EQ, and we understand and respect that. We're not going to reward that by turning off EQ in order to get everyone to play EQII .<p>We've worked out a very great storyline and transition path for those players that choose to check out EQII . We will be announcing the specifics of how descendants of your character(s) will carry on the family name well into the Age of Destiny that EQII is set in. There are a lot of other things that we plan on doing that will give our players a real sense of continuity in Norrath. All of this is in the cards and will be revealed over the next 6-12 months.<p>I also want to announce that many of our Legendary Subscribers will be the first to experience EverQuest II in its Beta sometime next year. We will be giving preference to longtime Legends Subscribers, so my suggestion is that if you're interested in EverQuest Legends, sign up now. After Legends players, longtime EQ subscribers will be eligible for a phase of the Beta as well. I realize this information is somewhat vague, and the onlyreason for that is we don't have an exact date just yet, but we should sometime later this year.</B><p>I'm sure there will be an uproar over the &quot;buy Legends to play the beta&quot; policy. The only thing that irks me about it is that, in theory, you want your best players testing your new game, and obviously the majority of the best players are not confined to Stormhammer. I think longtime EQ subscribers should have at least as much priority for getting into the beta as Legends folks. After all, the fact you pay an extra $27 a month doesn't make you qualified to be a beta tester.<p>The reassurances of support for &quot;EQ Classic&quot; are, well, reassuring. We'll be able to tell how serious they are based upon when the next expansion is announced. If Verant stays true to form, the next add-on would be unveiled sometime around December.<p>Is Verant really going to compete against itself with two different products? Why not? From their perspective, getting you to pay for either game is a victory, so it's in their best interests to keep EQ Classic alive for all those who can't or won't upgrade their PCs to run the new game. Besides, they know damn well that the majority of us who subscribe to EQ2 will keep our old accounts active, at least for a while. If nothing else, we'll want to chat and visit with old friends who aren't quite ready to make the journey forward in time. We'll also want to return to our level 60 characters sometimes and feel uber again. Hey, everyone will need a break from dying over and over to the fancy new orc pawns in EQ2.<p><BIG>Speaking of Upgrades...</BIG><p>Remember back last year when we talked about upgrading our PCs for Luclin? I moved from a P3-450 to a 1 gHz Athlon, and even then Luclin's performance wasn't everything I'd hoped. It still isn't--even with a GeForce 4. Oh sure, it's fine most of the time, but there are plenty of places where frame rates slow to a crawl with any of the new models on.<p>Being a hardware geek and longing for the best performance possible, I've been tracking prices on processors around the 2.0 gHz neighborhood for a while now. My intention was to upgrade again when these processors reached a certain point, but now I've officially put those plans on hold.<p>Why? Because of EQ2, frankly. Look at those screen shots. Even with a completely redesigned engine (that will hopefully be much more efficient than Luclin's), we'll need some serious horsepower to run the game smoothly.<p>I've decided to wait at least a year before I touch my motherboard and processor again. By that time, processors should be well into the 3 gHz range, and I bet the upper end of 2 gHz processors will be a real sweet spot in terms of price/performance. Plus, if nVidia stays true to form, the GeForce 5 will be all over the shelves by then, with whatever new features they dream up to lure you to their newest card.<p>Maybe a system overhaul with components like these will be enough to run EQ2 well.<p>Maybe.
