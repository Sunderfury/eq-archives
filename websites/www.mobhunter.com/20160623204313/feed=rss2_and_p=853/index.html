		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, you, Jeff and Dave were my three favorite people at SOE, and I always watched the livestreams you were in. I have never even built in Landmark, but I still got so excited by watching how excited you guys always were. I guess Nova doesn&#039;t realize the value, even in terms of profit, it is to have truly invested employers. Some time ago I bought Amalur, but I didn&#039;t have time to try it out at the time, and I ended up forgetting it, but I&#039;m going to play it now that I know you&#039;ve worked on it. Excited to see where you go next! Thank you Loreguard]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best of luck, Steve.  This genre is becoming a tough one to stomach.  I can&#039;t imagine what it must be like from your end.  I&#039;m starting to feel like there just won&#039;t be another universe as rich and broad as what we have continually hoped for.  But in any case, I look forward to seeing what you set out to accomplish next.  Thanks for giving it a shot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the reasons I was looking forward to EQNext was because you were one of the people shepherding it; you know so much about the Everquest world due to your excellent work on Everquest 2 (still one of the best MMO&#039;s in existence, for however much longer it exists).  I thought layoffs would happen after the acquisition, but releasing you is a terrible mistake on their part.  Good luck!]]></description>
