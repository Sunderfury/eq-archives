Mostly he dismissed some of the more esoteric reasons that players brought up to keep coins dropping, such as marking a path, leaving treasure for newbies, forcing a character save, etc. Then he mentioned my personal crusade on behalf of monks:<p><B>Here is the biggest area of concern, monks. I've, obviously, received a fair number of comments from monks. It is easier to drop coins than to destroy them.<p>We are looking into the possibility of setting up a command for destroying coin, something along the lines of '/destroycoin copper' that would just destroy all copper in your inventory. We will also be looking into the idea of limiting the coin you loot or split. So you could use a command to tell the game never to let you loot certain coin types and to never accept them as part of a split, most likely destroying the coins in the process. These are things we'd like to do and may tackle in the future.<p>I know that doesn't help now. But stopping the scamming is a priority, as it should be. It has to take precedence over convenience.</B><p>So Absor posted the exact solutions we want, but told us we're going to have to wait a while for them. Has this trade scam really come out of the blue so suddenly that this change is required right this second? I guess so.<p>Absor also chimed in with a bit of info for those who have such poor typing skills that they managed to type &quot;/movelog yes&quot; accidentally:<p><B>Our Movelog does not have a &quot;/movelog no&quot; function for canceling your decision to move. That is something we'll look into in the future. In the meantime for the move to Antonius Bayle we will be allowing people to 'cancel' their movelog to the Antonius Bayle server IF you send an email to here or send an email directly to eqmail@soe.sony.com with a subject line Cancel Movelog BEFORE Wednesday at 1 pm (pst) - which 21:00:00 Wed Nov 07 2001 in GMT, I think. As long as the email arrives before 1 pm our time we won't move your character. You must provide your station name and the name of the server that you moved from and to (no, don't send us your password). Please also clearly state that you would like to cancel your move to the server and make certain that the subject of your email is Cancel Movelog.<p>Alan</B><p>If only it was that easy to escape EuroDisney.<p>Have you played a monster on Test server yet?
