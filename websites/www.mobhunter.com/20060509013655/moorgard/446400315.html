Most of the models that you turn into using minor illusion (maybe all of them) were built to be stationary. They don't have any animations, and they used to cause people to get stuck all over the place when you could move. They would sometimes cause people to fall under the world too. There wasn't any way to fix it so that all of the beds and barrels in Norrath were able to function while animated, so the best solution was to prevent people from moving with the spell.<p>Alan</I><p>Not much to say here, but I hope you enjoyed having *TWO* musical references in the title of this article.<p>It's what I get paid for, ladies and gents.
