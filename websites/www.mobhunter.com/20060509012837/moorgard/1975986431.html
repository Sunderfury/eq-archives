Well, Brad may be gone, but now we have <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/eqlive/indev.jsp">Developer's Corner</a>, which has just given us something akin to Brad's musings--albeit without a face or a name:<p><B>Since the launch of The Shadows of Luclin, EverQuest has attracted many new players, giving us our largest number of subscribers ever. <p>Given the sudden arrival of so many new adventurers into the world of Norrath, which greatly exceeded our expectations, we've taken time to enrich the EverQuest experience at lower levels.<p>At the same time, we're in the process of making a number of changes aimed at improving the game for players of all levels. Stay tuned to this page for a more detailed report.<p>Some of the changes we are making are substantial and sweeping, others are more cosmetic and fun. At their core they all have the same goal: To allow more entertaining and less frustrating access to the rich and rewarding world for which EverQuest is famous.<p>We had assumed that such design revisions for lower levels would not be necessary for a three year old game. Indeed, we had already begun a great task designed primarily for the most seasoned of adventurers, which we will explain soon. However, our upsurge in new subscribers has convinced us otherwise. <p>This update is the first of several designed to revise the entry game of EverQuest. These changes should make our many new adventurers' journeys and tales even more exciting. To our many new adventurers in Norrath we say, &quot;Welcome!&quot;<p>We sincerely hope that our loyal EverQuest veterans will be pleased by the changes in the coming weeks aimed specifically at the higher levels. <p>In addition, we would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our customers, both old and new, for their support since the launch of Luclin. We hope you have noticed the many improvements we have made over the past months. However, we are certainly not done fixing problems and updating content as you will see in the months to come.<p>Thank you for helping the population of Norrath reach new heights. The adventure has just begun!<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>What the hell does all that mean? We don't know. Frankly, we're a bit scared--but excited, too.<p>Verant doesn't release subscriber data anymore, so we just have to believe them when they say that Luclin has brought more new players than ever--even though we were all pretty sure EQ was due to be hitting a plateau where it wouldn't see much subscriber growth at all.<p>Nathan Pearce--SOE's Director of Web Presence--said it this way when he sent us the announcement above:<p><B>It may not sound like much, but I suggest keeping a close eye on everquestlive.com in the next few days. There are some changes in the works that I, as a player (51 Cleric and 51.9 Warrior), will really enjoy, and I bet you will too.</B><p>Even Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000519.html">chimed in</a> to assure readers that these changes are something new and mysterious:<p><B>These are changes that are coming next week, not something that's already in. We just wanted to give a heads up about what was coming. We'll update you later with more details when we get all of our virtual ducks in a row.</B><p>So when will we see these big changes? Well, just maybe...<p><BIG>Here, Patchy Patchy</BIG><p>You might see some major changes on Tuesday:<p><B>On Tuesday, March 19th, at 12AM PST, (8AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 8 hours. <p>- The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>Yep, 8 hours is a major downtime, which means a bigger than normal patch. If things hold true to recent form, that also means follow-up patches the next day or two afterwards.<p>Just think how many Vulaks that would be, if he hadn't been placed so far out of reach. /sighs longingly<p><BIG>More Spell Junk</BIG><p>Jahaar (a.k.a. Rich Waters) once again posted in the <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008111-4.html">cleric forum</a> regarding further spell changes for our favorite healers:<p><B>Thanks for the feedback, I've been reading it all and pondering it. If I don't get to your post, it doesn't mean it was a bad idea at all - just some ideas are easier to accomplish, and some would need a lot of thought before they went in.<p>There were some good points raised all around, and here are some additional things that are up on Test Server now-<p>Judgement: Increased the damage to 925 points for the same 325 mana cost. Prior to the change, the spell was not a reasonable upgrade to Reckoning.<p>Enforced Reverance: Increased the damage to 300 points for the same 200 mana cost. Other aspects of the spell are unchanged. This should make it a useful upgrade to Sound of Force.<p>The concerns about people being confused by the names of the new Resurrect spells are quite valid. The programming team is going to see about adding the percent of experience returned to the Resurrection consent box. <p>As with anything on Test server, there's no guarantee it will make it to Live, but rest assured the EQ team is hard at work on improving the game.</B><p>Besides that, Casters Realm is <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4161">reporting</a> that druid, wizard, and shaman spells also got some tweaks on Test. The most substantial of these--the shaman group buff line--sees increases ranging from 5 to 26 stat points, which is pretty major. Shamans are <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=7630b4a838e1e90a214108d4a7e50890&amp;threadid=20753">excited</a>, and rightfully so, as their group buffs had lagged significantly behind the single buff versions.<p>Druids get a single-target version of Protection of the Glades, and they're <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=26729.topic">happy</a>, too. But the best part of this spell is the name: Protection of the Cabbage. I guess that's some kind of druid inside joke, because wood elves everywhere have been seen giggling and snickering non-stop.<p>Who isn't happy? I bet you can guess. Go on, just guess... Yep, you got it! Mages, <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=4187.topic">of course</a>. Even though it is obvious that their class will receive adjustment, the fact that they didn't get it first has a few of them complaining that clerics are now more powerful nukers than they are. Yes, they are bitching about clerics.<p>At the rate this is going, I'll never survive the upcoming caster balancing. Have my straightjacket waiting, please.<p><BIG>Stewed Lizard, Anyone?</BIG><p>Absor also wanted to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000513.html">assure tradeskill people</a> that recipes found in the new Temple of Cazic-Thule are indeed working:<p><B>Those recipes have been checked and double-checked. They work. It's just a matter of getting the right items in the right place at the same time. Everything that is an actual recipe does work, you'll just have to keep working on interpreting those journals.</B><p>Of course, in any message board thread anywhere that discusses this post, some yahoo will bring the old &quot;that's what they said about alchemy!&quot; argument. Poor Absor--and any other Verant spokesperson for the next 100 years--will never live that down. If Alan ever needs a warm fuzzy, though, he can always read the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000517.html">gratuitous praise</a> thread he started.<p><BIG>Chicken or the Egg?</BIG><p>In a rather surprising move, somebody is making a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000518.html">pencil-and-paper version</a> of our favorite game:<p><B>Atlanta, GA - White Wolf Publishing and Sony Online Entertainment Inc. announce a summer 2002 release of a pen and paper role-playing game, based on the immensely popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game, EverQuest&reg;.</B><p>Somebody better tell these guys that they have this whole process backwards. See, computer games are supposed to be based on popular pencil-and-paper games, not the other way around. What's next... novels based on movies?<p><BIG>We Forgot to Mention...</BIG><p>It was three years ago this week that EverQuest hit store shelves and changed the face of online gaming forever. Some days you love it, some days you hate it, but everyone reading this site has been affected in a major way by the existence of this game and the very real social world it created.<p>Our hats are off to everyone at Verant for making this such an interesting ride. Thanks, guys and gals. We can't wait to see what the future holds.
