We guess, we all guess, about what exactly it is that most players want, but nobody actually knows.<p>As for that sort of spell... no, I don't think such a spell will be created. For the same reason that we don't plan to add a summoning suppression type spell. There are, sadly, cases where summoning is an important way to prevent certain exploits. We don't plan to create spells that prevent summoning.<p>Alan</I><p>Absor gives the polite response here. I'll give an impolite one.<p>Our good friend Run does not, in fact, speak for the majority of players. At least, not the majority of players who have brains.<p>Oh, sure, the first time you fight a fire giant and get summoned, you think it's the end of the world. Of course, once yard trash in Sebilis starts summoning you, you're supposed to figure out that it's not that big a deal.<p>Why? Well, most of the time you are getting summoned across the room you're fighting in. Sure, you might get beaten to death by multiple summons, but even if you do, your corpse is right there. Corpse recovery is part of the game, and as long as it's easy just STFU and deal with it--or stay in Crushbone.<p>The time when CR <I>does</I> become a nightmare is when--you guessed it--a mob gates and then summons. Like, for instance, when you get jumped by a dragon in Western Wastes and proceed to beat her down, only to have her gate away when she reaches a sliver of health. Then, all of a sudden, your forces are summoned one by one clear across the zone to the dragon's spawn point.<p>Getting summoned is part of the game. Sometimes it's even kind of cool. But having a mob gate away from you is <b>never</b> any damn fun. And that's what makes the upcoming anti-gate spell so great.<p>Thanks, Absor, for nipping a n00b idea in the bud. Even if you were a little too polite about it.
