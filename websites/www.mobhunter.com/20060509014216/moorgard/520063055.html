Instead, read it <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000210.html">here</a>.<p>The Reader's Digest version: Brad listed why he thinks Conquest exploited Sleeper's Tomb, and Conquest responded with reasons why they think they didn't. To be fair, both sides had pretty good arguments, and Verant came off a <b>lot</b> better by revealing this information.<p>The issue boils down to intent (hey, that's what they always talk about on <a href="http://www.studiosusa.com/laworder/">Law &amp; Order   </a>). Did Conquest intend to exploit the zone or not? Part of their justification is that just about every Naggy/Vox raid exploits the same pathing issues that Verant is mentioning here, with seemingly no consequences. But does that justify Conquest's acknowledgement that they did knowingly exploit certain issues?<p>Make up your own minds, lemmings. At the very least, read the exchange and you will learn a lot about hate lists, aggro, and pathing bugs--stuff you will need to know if you ever get past level 24 and become l33t.<p>The ultimate moral of the story, is, perhaps, to watch what you say in guildchat, because Verant <b>is</b> watching.
