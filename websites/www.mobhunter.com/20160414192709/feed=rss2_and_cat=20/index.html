				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most of the time since I accepted the EQ2 community manager position at SOE, my old Mobhunter site has been in the capable hands of <a title="See Mike's smiling face" href="http://www.mikeshea.net/" target="_blank">Mike Shea</a>, a.k.a. <a title="That's a lot of writing!" href="http://mikeshea.net/loral/" target="_self">Loral Ciriclight</a>. Mike did a fantastic job keeping the spirit of the site alive, and over the years helped inspire many positive changes to good old EverQuest.</p>
<p>Recent changes to his life and gaming habits have caused Mr. Shea to decide that it&#8217;s time for him to <a title="/wave Loral" href="http://mobhunter.com/001569.html" target="_blank">step down as the writer for Mobhunter</a>. Mike will continue to write for his own site, so his fans should be sure to bookmark the address noted above. I&#8217;d like to personally thank Mike for his dedication and great work over the years. It always filled me with pride that the Mobhunter tradition continued on long after I was gone. (You can fumble through both my and Loral&#8217;s articles on the new <a title="Linked at the top of this page" href="http://www.moorgard.com/?page_id=284" target="_self">Mobhunter Archives page</a>).</p>
<p>Rather than turn the old site over to another writer or let the domain drift away into the nether, I&#8217;ve decided to take up the Mobhunter mantle for this blog. Moorgard.com is being re-branded as Mobhunter, which will become the primary domain in about a week. I have to admit, even though it&#8217;s just a cosmetic change, I&#8217;m very excited about writing under the Mobhunter banner once again!<span id="more-301"></span></p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m going back in time or anything. Just as Mobhunter evolved under Mike&#8217;s direction, my writing isn&#8217;t going to instantly return to my old style. I&#8217;m older now, and not quite as much of a pain in the ass as I used to be (my coworkers and wife may well disagree). Though I look back on my original articles with a great deal of fondness, I also recognize how presumptive I was about many things and how little I actually knew about making games.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more seasoned now, and I mean that will all the same connotations Commander Riker hated when Troi applied the word to him in &#8220;<a title="One of the best episodes" href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/The_Best_of_Both_Worlds_(episode)" target="_blank">The Best of Both Worlds</a>.&#8221; But the fact is, I&#8217;m just a different person than I was seven years ago when the original Mobhunter first saw the light of day. And besides, having passed through the looking glass into game development, it would be disingenuous of me to try to sound like I did all those years ago&#8211;though I do sometimes miss the shouting matches with Furor.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope folks indulge me in my return to Mobhunter, even if it&#8217;s just a slightly different twist on my home for the last several years, Moorgard.com. It&#8217;s like slipping on a favorite old coat that I haven&#8217;t worn in a long time.</p>
<p>That musty smell? Yeah, it&#8217;s me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s not often that a single post can be articulate, nerdy, informative, funny, and fascinating all at once, but James Wallis manages to hit every one of those marks in <a title="Good stuff" href="http://www.spaaace.com/cope/?p=111" target="_blank">an article analyzing the virtual world of Azeroth from a scholarly perspective</a>.</p>
<p>As someone who designs the geography of game worlds, I enjoyed the data gathering aspects of this article. And as a writer who appreciates a tongue-in-cheek approach while <a title="An oldy but a goodie" href="http://mobhunter.com/moorgard/292602756.html" target="_blank">sounding</a> very <a title="It's about pooping" href="http://mobhunter.com/moorgard/-376381988.html" target="_self">serious</a>, the post made me chuckle.</p>
<p>You can also check out a video of Wallis&#8217; live presentation <a title="In case you can't read" href="http://www.spaaace.com/cope/?p=108" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>(Note: The title for this article is drawn from one of the most fabulous posts ever made on the EQ2 forums, which sadly no longer seems to exist. In it, the author was ranting about something and cited a bunch of crazy crap to back up his claims, adding the classic phrase &#8220;Also, I am a scientist.&#8221; Which is brilliant on so many levels, and still makes Shwayder and me chuckle to this day.)</em></p>
