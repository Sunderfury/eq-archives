Last I heard from JC, a couple days after it went down, we've lost our ISP for the site. He was supposed to have a temp page back up in a day or two, but that's running a bit behind. As soon as I find out what the status is, I will drop a mail your way.<p>~Akaran D, Editor, GameZnet.com<br>~J. &quot;DeHawk&quot; Smith</B><p>This is good news. Far too many EQ sites have fallen by the wayside recently.<p>EQ'Lizer is a great &quot;spoiler&quot; site. I really hate using that term, because it has such a negative connotation. It's an information site--and a favorite of mine. These guys are good about authenticating items before making them go live, unlike <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">similar</a> sites. It's also easy to find what you need; I refer to their bestiary often to get the stats on something that just dropped from a dragon or a god.<p>When we get an updated URL, we'll pass it on to you.
