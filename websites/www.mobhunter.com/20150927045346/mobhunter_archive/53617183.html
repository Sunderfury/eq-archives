Why, I'm gonna file a petition! I'm gonna hold a demonstration! I'm gonna... uh...<p>What's that, Absor?<p><B>If you are running under the Windows 95 operating system and, therefore, can no longer play EverQuest, and your account was in good standing as of December 3, 2001, you may be entitled to receive a refund of the purchase price for the EverQuest product(s) you recently bought and any subscription money paid for the period December 4, 2001 onward.</B><p>See the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000437.html">fine print</a> for details on how to get your money back. Or, how about this--you step up to 1998 technology and freaking upgrade to Win98. I mean, seriously, what sort of gamer is using buggy old Win95 for anything?<p>Granted, I suppose there are some folks who love Lower Guk and just want to stay there without upgrading to DirectX 8.1. Fine, I suppose. But seriously, Win95 was just the beta version of Win98--the most stable of the Windows operating systems built on the DOS core. Nobody has any excuse not to have 98SE--at a minimum--on their systems.<p><BIG>From the Patch Desk</BIG><p>Here's a real shocker:<p><B>On Tuesday, December 18th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch.

Consider this case, for example:<p><I>&quot;Hi, my name is Bobby, and my guild killed Cazic Thule 37 times in the last month. I also collect navel lint and eat my own poopies.&quot;</I><p>One day these daily patches will end, and people like Bobby will get the help they so richly deserve. Hurry, Verant--for Bobby's sake.<p><BIG>AMD = DOA?</BIG><p>Verant sent out a lovely press release that's sure to delight Athlon owners everywhere:<p><B>SAN DIEGO, CA December 17, 2001 - Sony Online Entertainment Inc., a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming has joined forces with Intel Corporation to bring the largest community of online gamers the best gaming experience available.  The two companies are working together to enhance the graphics of EverQuest&reg;, the most successful massively multiplayer online role-playing game, for Intel&reg; Pentium 4 processor-based systems by offering higher frame rates and smoother animations.<br> <br>&quot;Working with Intel will allow us to deliver the best possible online experience for today's gamer,&quot; said Scott McDaniel, vice president of marketing, Sony Online Entertainment.  &quot;Gamers are a savvy group of people, always looking for new games and equipment.  Through programming teamwork and expertise we are able to significantly enhance the gaming experience for Intel Pentium 4 owners.&quot;  <p>Designed to provide the graphical and technical specification necessary for today's 3D graphic display, the Intel Pentium 4 processor will provide the ultimate gameplay experience available.  With the improved graphics of EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin, which sold more than 120,000 units in its first 24 hours of availability, gamers are in for a rich, immersive role-playing experience.<p>&quot;Intel is pleased to be working with Sony Online Entertainment to optimize EverQuest for Pentium 4 processor-based systems&quot;, said Deborah Conrad, Vice President, Intel Solutions Marketing Group.  &quot;A Pentium 4 processor based system is the ideal EverQuest gaming platform, giving gamers the speed and fluidity they want.&quot;</B><p>What does all that mean? It's hard to say. Despite my deliberately goading headline, AMD owners shouldn't be sweating too much. I mean, how many <a href="http://www.electrotank.com/games/playGames.asp?gameID=34">games</a> can you name that require MMX, let alone features of the Pentium 4?<p>If there turn out to be some whiz-bang Luclin effects that only work on the P4 chip, then those of us with Athlons can start <a href="http://www.nfl.com/ce/recap/0,3762,NFL_20011216_JAC@CLE,00.html">throwing stuff</a>, but until then let's just keep our cool and see this whole thing for what it is--probably just so much marketing hype. There are far more <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/december_01/12_14/hinammer.jpg">disturbing</a> things in the universe to worry about.
