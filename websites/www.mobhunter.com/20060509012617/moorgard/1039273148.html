And WTF is a Sleeper?&quot;</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-08-01</p>The Sleeper is awake, and nobody knows what it means.<p>Verant needs to realize that they have exactly the same problem with virtually every major in-game event they try to have. A few reports trickle out, and news might leak to <a href="http://eqvault.ign.com/">EQ Vault</a> or something, but no one knows the context or repercussions of the event. Look at the stuff happening in the Karanas. Aside from a few plot threads, does anyone know what's really going on?<p>The only way people will get immersed in the <b>story</b> of EverQuest--if that's really a goal of Verant--is for Verant to post summaries of in-game events on their Web site as soon as they happen.<p>In-game newspapers are not enough. Hints on <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/hht/index.jsp">Harpy's Head Tavern</a> are not enough. We want full disclosure of these events, complete with screenshots, as soon as they have been carried out on the servers. Make these summaries nice and clear, so even knuckleheads like me can figure it out.<p>I, and many others, desperately want to believe that there is a story to this game that runs deeper than a static conflict between the Freeport Militia and the Knights of Truth. The battle of Bloody Kithicor was well done, but in the more than two years since the game went live, events like this one are far too few and way too far between.<p>The Sleeper is awake. I hope that means more than just another corpse run for those who happened to be caught in the big guy's wake on one night of their EQ lives.
