		<description><![CDATA[Well, call me a socialist (you should, since I am), but it&#039;s a shame that folks in your industry don&#039;t form labor unions and fight to win  contracts that guarantee pay, vacation, benefits, and so forth, allowing you at the least a seat in bankruptcy court. 

You can&#039;t say with a straight face that unions would have &quot;too much power&quot; in a workplace like a game studio, where wealthy backers and corporations call all the shots. Having a union there would help to equalize that power imbalance...not enrich mythical &quot;fat cat union bosses.&quot; I&#039;m bitter for you as well brother Moorgard. I wish you all the best at your eventual new workplace which will be, I fear, at the whims of the market too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[...] [Source] If you have been following gaming news, you probably would have read about the downfall of 38 Studios, the developer behind the single-player RPG, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. The in-development MMO version, codenamed Project Copernicus, was canned as well. Over the past few months, a couple of in-game videos on the MMO game were shown, and here is yet another new one. &#160;  &#160; According to the source who worked on the project, there are also systems which will be driven by player choices as well, leaving a permanent change on the game. If you missed the previous news, Nexon was supposedly 1 of the potential investors for the game.

		<description><![CDATA[Well I am bitter that I&#039;ll never get the month of salary, unpaid vacation, and expense checks owed to me, but I&#039;ve accepted that. I&#039;m mournful that we won&#039;t get to finish our game, but I&#039;ve come to accept that too.

Despite the lingering sadness of these posts, I am moving on. I&#039;ll soon be announcing much happier news: the next phase of my career.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I waited for this game, and now I&#039;ll mourn it along with the sad circumstances surrounding its demise.
I wish there were some fully featured videos available. Especially some showing combat and exploration, even with rudimentary rendering only. Right now it&#039;s a lot of pretty stuff to look at, but unfortunately we still haven&#039;t seen the meat of the game - and I so wish I could showcase that meat to my doubting friends.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pretty nice video.   You can begin to imagine what a close to release trailer might look like... really special.  I wonder how this game would have stood up to the current and future behemoths of the surely crazy triple-A MMO landscape.  If it had made it to launch, polished, and F2P... definitely a winner, but we will never know.

I&#039;m sad to see your writings turn ever so slightly bitter and remorseful MG, even though noone could ever blame you for feeling that way.  Your writings whether about a game you&#039;re involved with or just a news post from the old Everquest days, have always been fascinating and enjoyable.  And for many people, reading about a game they won&#039;t play for a while or can never play, in this case, was often just as enjoyable or moreso than the game itself, and that&#039;s down to people like you.

I hope you find your way.]]></description>

Don&#039;t know what the gameplay would have been like, and of course that is important, but I sure would have liked to give this a run.]]></description>
