That's All, Just &quot;Patch&quot;</BIG><p>In a few hours from the time I write this, the servers will be down for another patch:<p><B>On Tuesday, December 11th, at 12AM PST, (8AM GMT), all servers will be coming down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 4 hours.<p>The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>Not a lot of info there, but hopefully this patch brings some much-needed positive changes rather than just another nerf of the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=99227894">AAS</a>. Abashi posted over the weekend about solving some of the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000422.html">issues with AMD processors</a>, but my AMD system was still having lag and framerate issues as of last night.<p>I don't know if my problems are because of my processor or because the code wasn't ready for prime time. Just fix it, k?<p>And as frustrating as all this has been, let's just remember that EQ isn't the only game to ever make a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=20419722&amp;replies=362">huge blunder</a>.<p><BIG>Don't Forget to Wipe</BIG><p>Also getting &quot;patched&quot; tonight is Verant's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Technical+Help&amp;number=3&amp;DaysPrune=20&amp;LastLogin=">Technical Help</a> board, which as you might imagine is being overrun with problems posted by upset players. The solution: wipe them out--all of them!<p><B>Hello Folks,<br>Do to the fact that we are going to be having a few patches in the next week in order to try to keep some order here on the boards and to better organize the amount of data we are receiving here we will be &quot;wiping&quot; the boards after every patch. <br>We are not doing this to ignore any issues that exist but rather so we can see who has not been fixed by the patch(s).<p>Some of you may still be having issues that we are going to be working on and some of you may issues that will need to be resolved by you, with our help, and so if you have posted and found your message deleted we apologize and we want to assure that we are only doing this in order to serve you better. <p>========================<br>Brad Griffin<br>Customer Service Rep<br>Sony Online Entertainment/<br>1-858-537-0898 <br>========================</B><p>Hehehe, the grammar cop in me can't resist this one: &quot;Do to the fact...&quot;<p>I guess keeping order on the boards is important, though wiping never makes anyone happy.<p>Okay, I'm getting uncomfortable with potential metaphors here, so let's just move on to the next subject, shall we?<p><BIG>Face Dances Tonight</BIG><p>Have you picked a new face for your Luclin-enabled characters yet? Well, snap to it, soldier, because your window of opportunity is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000414.html">closing soon</a>, according to Absor:<p><B>Right now a player can change his character's face as often as he or she likes. Once we have all of the problems with the /facepick command ironed out, we will be removing that complete freedom. However, players will always have a one-time chance to change the faces of existing (pre-Luclin) characters.<p>We don't know when this will happen, as it's dependent on getting a few bugs ironed out.<p>Alan</B><p>I must confess, the whole facial selection thing is a big deal for me, as I care a lot about how Moorgard looks. I've changed his face countless times, and after I finish this article I just might log in and change it once again. But unlike Joan Rivers' cosmetic dabblings, our little plastic surgery experiment can't go on forever, so you'd best pick something you like and stick with it.<p>I wonder if I can follow my own advice...<p><BIG>Do You Have the Stones for It?</BIG><p>The way porting to Luclin is supposed to work is that you run up to a greater spires, ask the scion for a transport stone, and wait for the spell to be cast that takes everyone holding a stone within the transport circle to the Nexus. Well, one of our readers--Jiksaw Puzl, a wizard from the Tunare server--told us that he was ported from both DL and GFay without holding a stone. Being the ace reporter that I am, I went to the NK spires last night to test this out and was indeed ported without holding a gem.<p>Just a warning to any of you who may be hanging around watching the sunset only to find yourselves on the moon, I guess. On the other hand, it's a cool way to escape one of those nasty GFay pixie trains, if you manage to time it properly.<p><BIG>A Party in Venril's Pants</BIG><p>Another reader--Sutekh of Mith Marr--reports that a recent kill of Venril Sathir netted a new type of leggings: <B>Wild Lord's Trousers--AC 6, STR 5, DEX 5, STA 5, WIS 8, AGI 5, HP 50, MANA 10, Effect: Health, wt. 0.5, BST only, all beastlord races.</B><p>The monk in me can't help but point out that VS has <B>never</B> dropped leggings for my class, and since most every monk-only item has been converted to be beastlord usable, it seems only fair that these leggings be BST/MNK. Not that many of us would wear pants that are AC 6 anymore, but it's the principle of the thing.<p><BIG>Cheapest Headache in Town</BIG><p>Savvy shoppers among you have already found that Circuit City is selling Shadows of Luclin for $12.99 this week. Yet another of our readers submitted a way to get it even cheaper:<p><B>Okies, I found something interesting today when I brought my receipt and Circuit City advertisement to Electronics Boutique.<p>First, Circuit City Luclin is $12.99 and Best Buy $19.99.<p>1) EB price matching policy is 110% of the difference in an EB Voucher.<br>2) They have a $10.00 Rebate Voucher.<p>$29.99 (my price) - $17.00 (Price Difference) - $1.70 (10% Difference) - $10.00 Rebate  ==== $1.29 <p>Note: This does not include Tax.  Also, it does apply to EB online.  They do match the price after you purchase Luclin.<p>Buy Luclin for $1.29  Tax Not Included.<p>Uuena Van Light<br>Xegony<br>Level 57 Wizard</B><p>That's just enough math to make my head sore, but if you feel adventurous, go for it.
