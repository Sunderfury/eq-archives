Well, that's the joy of Christmas shopping, isn't it? But rather than standing in long lines at the mall this season, we at Mobhunter have the luxury of doing our shopping online.<p>Take a peak under our Christmas tree and see a few of the presents we bought for some folks you may be familiar with. The real trick was figuring out who's been naughty and who's been nice...<p><BIG>THE NICE</big><p><B>Verant -</b> This was the toughest one to call. They gave us so many toys to play with this year--Shadows of Luclin being chief among them--that you'd think Santa would be kind. But considering that so many of those new toys were broken--once again, Shadows of Luclin in particular--they dropped a few notches on the naughty/nice scale. But rather than a lump of coal, we decided to buy Verant what it needs most: a new beta testing program. What's that, you say? They already have a 400,000+ user beta program? Hmm, glad we saved the receipt.<p><B>Mythic -</b> Another tough call on the naughty/nice scale. On the one hand, this bunch of upstarts took away Lum the Mad from us and tried to put Verant out of business (well, they had dreams about it, I'm sure). On the other hand, their ability to precisely mimic so many of EverQuest's features while improving--significantly, in some cases--upon them actually drove Verant to ameliorate EQ. For that fact alone, we decided to put them on our shopping list. The gift: more content designers, since they seem to have a nice engine but not many places to go with it. We also bought them a big container of solvent, with which they can hopefully dissolve the glue holding down their relics.<p><B>Brad McQuaid -</b> Aradune's only clearly naughty act was waving good-bye to us and riding off into the sunset; but he has the chance to redeem himself if he strikes gold twice and develops a new online game that improves upon EverQuest in every conceivable way. As this is a pretty tall order (though not beyond his capabilities), we're giving Brad one of the things he needs most: a crack team of designers and content writers to design the most kick-ass MMORPG ever. We'd like to give Brad the other things he needs--boatloads of cash and worldwide distribution--but given the state of the Mobhunter treasury, I'm afraid our good wishes will have to suffice.<p><BIG>THE NAUGHTY</big><p><B>Winona Ryder -</b> We had some nice presents picked out for this lovely actress (we still have a warm place in our hearts for her work in <I>Heathers</i>), but it turns out everything we bought for her was found in her bag by store security. Thus, we're returning all the goodies we purchased and are filling her stocking with coal and a box of pencils. Better luck next year.<p><B>Osama bin Laden -</b> Our gifts: a bullet in the brain and a hand grenade up the ass--not necessarily in that order. Die, you heinous prick.<p>Not wanting to end our list on a bitter note, here's one more for the road:<p><BIG>THE NICEST</big><p><B>Our readers -</b> We're going to give you the only gift we really can: our honest opinions, our best efforts at finding information, and as much truth as we can squeeze out of this crazy universe known as EverQuest. Oh, and one other thing, which comes with a big bow on it: our thanks for being here.<p><B>Whatever your nation or religion, have a great Christmas season!</b>
