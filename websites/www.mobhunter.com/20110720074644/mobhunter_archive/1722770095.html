Aside from maybe Sanctus Seru, the towns weren't built to be raided, making them more like Old World zones than those on the frozen continent of Velious.<p>This was proven recently by the <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9290.topic">slaying of the Vah'Shir king</a>. The royal kitty didn't drop any <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_1723000/1723583.stm">booty</a>, and promptly respawned two minutes later.<p>Odd. You'd think he would drop a ball of yarn, and maybe a partially digested mouse or two.<p><BIG>It's a Wonder There Aren't Coke Machines on Luclin</BIG><p>There's a New York Times article on <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nyt/20011231/tc/expanion_sought_for_online_games_1.html">the future of online gaming</a> floating around that discusses what the market might be seeing in the near future in terms of growth. A familiar name surfaces to make a prediction:<p><B>&quot;We're looking at a market we think has 700,000 active consumers right now,&quot; said Kelly Flock, chief executive of Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;That's minuscule, but it seems to be growing. If we can get to 30 million households considering online gaming, you'll have a business worth $300 million a month in revenue. That's a $3.5-billion-a-year business, and that seems possible.&quot;</B><p>The article talks about the upcoming Sims and Star Wars online games, and how these are seen to be major forces in the market to come. The Sims angle will definitely be hot, as this line of games has been around for some time with little sign of burning out.<p>However, the real winner is going to be Star Wars Galaxies. The very fact that this game takes place in the universe of Lucas means that untold numbers of people will be buying this game. Mark my words: <I>SWG is going to make EverQuest's subscription numbers look like a joke.</I> People who never touched a computer before will buy one just to play this game.<p>The online games of the future--much like the feature films of today--will become an advertising opportunity:<p><B>Electronic Arts executives said they had already been approached by well-known companies who would like their products placed in the online versions of the Sims games, although they would not disclose the names of those companies, or the nature of the discussions.<p>Mr. Koenig, the NPD analyst, said he, too, had heard murmurs of possible advertising arrangements in online games. &quot;You might have a storefront for Domino's Pizza in the game, and you could click on it and order a pizza for delivery to your house,&quot; he said. &quot;That would be incredible. At that point, we're only a step away from virtual reality.&quot;</B><p>Well, I don't know what Domino's has to do with reality, as their ingredients certainly don't taste like anything indiginous to this world, but you get the point. In 2002, expect to see King Tormax holding a giant can of Hormel Chili, Lord Nagafen wearing a fab mock turtleneck from The Gap, and Tunare modeling the latest lingerie from Victoria's Secret.<p><BIG>The Uberest Plane, Bad Mages, and Other Patch Tricks</BIG><p>There was yet <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/netstat/downtime.jsp">another emergency patch</a> on December 28th. Truthfully, we've become so desensitized to patches lately that we let this one just kind of roll off our backs. But it turns out there were a couple changes worth noting.<p>The changes to the north wing of Temple of Veeshan--which Verant had forewarned us about ages ago--were finally brought to <a href="http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm12.showMessage?topicID=166.topic">fruition</a>. A roaming drake and wurm now patrol the area around the Plane of Mischief entrance, making the old safe spot for Call of the Hero <a href="http://www.noows.com/showthread.php?threadid=4782&amp;perpage=15&amp;pagenumber=7">not so safe</a> anymore.<p>Which leads to one question: what the hell is PoM in the game for, anyway? Quest drops now suck, and the resulting armor is so far out of whack in terms of the old Risk vs. Reward formula that anyone bothering to go there now is flat out nuts. If this plane was really intended to take a raid-level force of NToV-capable people to even enter it, then the rewards should be on par with or better than any loot that drops on the way to the zone-in. Those rumors of alternate entrances that float around in random zones better turn out to be true, or else there's really no reason to have Mischief in the game anymore.<p>Anyway, the real reason for the &quot;emergency&quot; patch was probably a neat little trick that an <a href="http://farkle.20megsfree.com/">enterprising mage</a> named Farkle Jackson made famous. It seems there was a way to use (read: exploit) Eye of Zomm to create a limitless supply of pets. A mage with enough willpower could create his own rabid pet army and march upon the camps of the enemy--and Farkle did just that. While entertaining, this same technique could be used to make the lives of other players miserable, not to mention unbalance the game, so Verant no doubt acted quickly to squash this bug.<p>Some mages might get <a href="http://www.andreasen.org/bartle/test.cgi">testy</a>, but aside from a nerf of funny Web sites, there isn't a real downside to this fix.
