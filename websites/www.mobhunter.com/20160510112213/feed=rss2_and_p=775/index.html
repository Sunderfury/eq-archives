I wish you all the best luck and glad to see you back in development! I thoroughly encourage you rip off err pay homage to guild wars 2 because that game has done a great job at some core mmo problems.

		<description><![CDATA[Congrats on the gig in familiar surroundings. You didn&#039;t even throw in the lack of a winter season as a reason to head back to San Diego in October, that&#039;s probably a good sign. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad to see you back at SOE...VG is one of the great MMOs that has yet to reach its full potential.  I had reactivated my account a few weeks ago, and am even more confident that it will be heading in the right direction again now that you&#039;re there.  Good luck in the new job!]]></description>
