		<description>I feel your pain. I have in the layoff seat. I have been the one that had to walk out a laid off coworker. I avoid it twice so far at the current job I love. There usually no rhyme or reason for selection it seems to me. Just so odd organic algorithm.</description>

		<description>I do hope it eventually makes it to market daylight in a pleasing way. Assuming a purchaser didn&#039;t recruit back key talent .... wouldn&#039;t the game still be looking at a 3+ year cycle to learn, assimilate, and then finalize?


I agree the court stuff as it stands is pretty awful,  but to step back from 38 Studios .... one thing that this process illustrated, the US doesn&#039;t have enough protections for employees in this kind of situation.  If a company is withholding money from an employee&#039;s paycheck for benefits, and then not paying those benefit providers ... there really needs to be a legal notification to the employees when the first payment is missed.  (I&#039;m on the fence about criminal liability for the executives choosing not to pay those bills).   It&#039;s not just 38 where this has happened, Hostess had a similar issue where the management group wasn&#039;t making pension payments, but was deducting money from paychecks for it.   That&#039;s theft from where I&#039;m sitting, plain and simple.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ll have to disagree on the GW2 questing style. I like the personal quests in GW2 but once those sort of ran out, I just felt like I was wandering from spot to spot, doing heart quests, collecting vistas or talents while waiting for an event to trigger/start.

It sounds like there was a lot to do, but it wasn&#039;t things I enjoyed for a length of time. Vista jump puzzles? Bleh. Talent/trait battles? Pretty much a stomp the NPC with all the other people there to get their trait (in the odd occasion it was more about clicking on a spot). The events, themselves, weren&#039;t all that spectacular and were pretty repetitive.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, in no way am I saying WoW questing is better - it isn&#039;t. I just don&#039;t think GW2&#039;s mechanism warrants the credit it is getting... unless you&#039;re an explorer type. It really caters well to people that like exploring.

I&#039;m still waiting for something that suites me.</description>

		<description>I wonder if it be possible to commune with my dear brother after so many moons have passed.  Long ago we faced challenge and adventure together and forged a bond worthy of legend.  The north wind has never ceased its blowing old friend.  A vergence was sensed by me in the cool afternoon breeze and honor compelled me to heed its call.  Let us see if you remember the old ways and the code that was established in ancient days long past.  I shall meditate on this and hope that proves to be so.  Perhaps your chi will be stirred as well great one.

I Am Splos!  Hear Me Roar!</description>

		<description>To be clear, I wasn&#039;t complaining about dungeon finder. I have been playing a fair amount of WoW again lately, and I use it a lot--especially at lunch time. It&#039;s extremely good at what it does, particularly with the layers of polish about putting you back exactly where you left off in the &quot;regular&quot; world.

I&#039;m just pointing out that it&#039;s a tradeoff. You are sacrificing relatedness for content accessibility. I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s a bad trade; clearly WoW does just fine with it. I&#039;m just saying it&#039;s a conscious design choice that goes beyond the arguments I often hear against it, like how it ruins exploration or the sense of worldliness.</description>

		<description>The balancing act is sizing the MMO so &quot;bite sized&quot; content runs of 30 minutes or less isn&#039;t considered a cop-out or a let-down in some way.  WoW&#039;s concept of the &quot;lunch time battleground&quot; was a very good one and a huge part of it&#039;s initial success.

Quick, Automated grouping is part of what enables that.  Running LDoN, a strong group could clear some missions in 30 minutes, and you could string 2-3 sessions together relatively quickly. Doesn&#039;t sound so bad, right?  How long did it take you to assemble that strong group? Have trouble finding a healer, wipe a couple of times, etc, and you&#039;re at 90 minutes and haven&#039;t done anything yet besides get frustrated with the random folks you&#039;ve manually paired yourself with.

The real problem in the equation is that there&#039;s a decent chunk of players who *need* the automated functions to properly experience content in the game in the time they have.  Then, you get the min-max crowd jumping in as well because its just faster. 

Limiting the number of runs you can make in instances, particularly for free players, is one option. Not enabling some instances for auto-grouping is another.   To do it right though, you have to allow some extra time to move content into the queuing system as new stuff gets released.

And I don&#039;t care if its an old fashioned pick up group or an automated match maker, the odds of me not talking are low. :)</description>
