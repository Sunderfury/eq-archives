I have ran into many monks that have not been able to find these guys. I have had many friends with the trackng skill to see if they can find these guys. No one can find them any more. So i started checking other message boards. I have seen that this is an issue in all servers it seems like. I am sure it has something to do with the up and coming war. The gnolls are gathering to attack Qeynos and what not. I am going to start searching other zones for these guy but it would be nice if it was mentined by the quest giver or some how communicated. I know the point of quest is to search for your prey but when the prey we used to search for gets taken out or moved a little hint would be nice so we don't waste alot of time campng an area where they don't roam in any more. I have an idea maybe where they are but I was wondering if you could at least give some sorta hint to where these guys have gone too. THANKS</I><p>Well after much searching and repoping of zones we have finally found that the mobs are completely missing.<p>One of our developers is working on putting those npc's back. I will post when it will be patched.<p>Thank you everyone for all the input and information, it made tracking down this problem much easier.<p>Ester</B><p>Moving the named gnoll mobs into South Karana was never that great an idea, as it took a zone with too many rare spawns as it is and made it even worse. Ah, for the good old days when the shamans were found inside Paw. I sat outside one of those rooms for three days waiting for that sucker to pop.<p>Kudos to all those monks who continue to do the headband/sash quests in hopes of attaining the Robe of the Lost Circle, even though Verant has provided a l33t workaround that they refuse to fix. I say that if they can put in a quest for Ghoulbane then they can add an Iksar-specific quest for the RotLC and make Brothers Qwinn and Zephyl stop dropping their loot. They are, unless I am horribly mistaken, the only quest mobs in the game who drop their quest reward when killed without giving any negative faction hit whatsoever.<p>Anyway, thanks, Ester, for working on this problem.
