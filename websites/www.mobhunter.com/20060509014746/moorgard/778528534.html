(&quot;This ability does not work with bard songs.&quot;)<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>Hey, what do you know, they fixed some <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=1714944980&amp;msgid=2061126595#message">bard issues</a>. I don't know if that was what was so urgent <I>[natural botanicals]</I>... maybe some <a href="http://news1.iwon.com/article/id/171137|oddlyenough|03-20-2002::07:48|reuters.html">really interesting loot</a> was dropping in a newbie zone somewhere and needed to be nerfed.<p>In any case, I long for the days of simple patches that don't need a follow-up (or several). Now that many mobs don't show up on patch day, a lot of high-level folk end up not doing a heck of a lot.<p><BIG>Mages Take Over the Game</BIG><p>Over on the Fires of Heaven message board, the ever-popular Furor went on a bit of a <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=481">tear</a>, stating his opinion that the new mage-summonable caster focus items throw the game completely out of whack. Basically, mages can summon items with abilities that reduce casting time, save on reagent consumption, and increase damage output (among other things). These summoned trinkets are quickly replacing NToV-level items for many casters, since even the best mana/stat items can't come close to making the difference that these focus items do.<p>Mages, for <a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=4378.topic">their part</a>, want to defend their new functionality--and who can blame them? While previous tells to mages consisted of &quot;coh plz thx&quot; and &quot;rod plz thx,&quot; mages are now getting tells from wood elf druids along the lines of &quot;Ohhh, please, you handsome mage, may I have one of those pretty bracers you can summon? They make me feel soooooo sexy!&quot;<p>Do these items completely unhinge any sense of balance left in the game? In the typical Sebilis exp group, not really. But in a NToV or Ssra Temple raid, you have to admit they do. The big question is whether Verant will be satisfied with the current difficulty of high-end encounters with summoned focus items taken into account, or if there will have to be significant re-tuning to properly balance the game.<p>While I'd hate to see anything further taken away from mages (CoH in Luclin, anyone?), the big picture does have to be considered, and the overall health of the game needs to be the priority. If summoned items can make a guild that couldn't break Fear last week suddenly able to spawn Vulak, then something definitely has to be re-evalutated.<p>Hopefully it can be done in such a way that mages can retain their newfound usefulness without trivializing every raid-type encounter in the game. After all, mages need druid cyber, too.<p><B>Update:</B> Our spdat guru, Remelio, sent us the following note about the patch today (he was helped by a <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10400.topic">thread</a> at the Safehouse. Seems Verant was quick to change a few things...<p><B>Modified Effects:<p>- Jedah's Lesser Conservation - Something was added to this? - Not new, but this only works on spells less than 12<p>- Jedah's Conservation - Something was added to this? - Not new, but this only works on spells less than 44<p>- Jedah's Greater Conservation- Something was added to this? - Not new, but this only works on spells less than 60 (which would explain why I saw no benefit from wearing it and casting KEI)<p>- Gallenite's Minor Destruction - Something was added to this? - Not new, but this only works on spells less than 34<p>- Gallenite's Destruction - Something was added to this? - Not new, but this only works on spells less than 52<p>- Gallenite's Major Destruction - Something was added to this? - Not new, but this only works on spells less than 60<p>- Naki's Lesser Pernicity - Now only effects spells with cast time greater than 4 and less than 9.5 - Not new, but this only works on spells less than 29<p>- Naki's Charm of Pernicity - Now only effects spells with cast time greater than 4 and less than 9.5 - Not new, but this only works on spells less than 51<p>- Naki's Greater Pernicity - Now only effects spells with cast time greater than 4 and less than 9.5 - Not new, but this only works on spells less than 60 <p>Notes: When the cast reduce rings were working on spells greater than 9.5, it did work on reducing the cast time on KEI, a level 60 spell, so maybe these mean less than or equal to 60 instead of less than 60?</B><p>Let the cries of &quot;Verant is at the beck and call of the uberguilds&quot; begin. With a little effort, I'm sure you can find a way to blame Mobhunter, too.<p><BIG>Tinting Gets Proper</BIG><p>I reported yesterday that I was having problems getting the new armor tinting to work--skin colors were turning black. Well, today I got a helpful e-mail from one of those Verant guys:<p><B>You're right - It broke mine, too.  We just haven't changed the recommended drivers list yet.<p>We'll be updating Ge2/Ge3 &quot;recommended&quot; to ver 27.20<p><a href="http://www.guru3d.com">www.guru3d.com</a> --  your new best friend. ;)<p>Scott Hartsman<br>Technical Director, EverQuest</B><p>After downloading the newer drivers, I was properly tinted and ready to go. Here's a comparison of the bugged look alongside the correctly tinted version:<p><TABLE border="0" cellpadding="5"><TR><TD><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/blackmoor1.jpg"></TD><TD><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/nonblack.jpg"></TD></TR><TR><TD><H5>Moorgard dons his ninja outfit and begins looting bone chips in West Freeport.</H5></TD><TD><H5>Moorgard slips into something more comfortable and pours you a glass of wine.</H5></TD></TR></TABLE><p>Thanks much for the assist, Scott, as well as to all the Mobhunter readers who lent me a hand. Even though it's nice to have things working, that tinting bug did look pretty cool.<p>The command, once again, to activate this is: <B>/dopropertinting on</B>--after which you have to log out and come back. Remember, not all video cards will support this feature, though most any current one should.<br>
