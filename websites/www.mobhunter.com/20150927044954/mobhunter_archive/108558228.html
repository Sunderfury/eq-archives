The estimated downtime is 5 hours.</B><p>Whoopee, another day that Euro/Asian guilds get a free shot at ubermobs before the US players can log on. There's an editorial brewing here, if I ever get around to writing it.<p><BIG>EverQuest, Circa 1992</BIG><p>I think it was about ten years ago that I finally made the transition from having GEnie as my main online connection to using a regular dialup ISP (I had just retired my faithful Atari ST in favor of an uber 486DX-33 with a whopping 4 megs of RAM). In those days, there weren't a lot of Web sites with fancy graphics consuming oodles of bandwidth--the standard 2400 baud modem wasn't real keen on processing that much data.<p>In the modern age of broadband, of course, sites tend to flood you with image-heavy pages, and the EQ Live site is no exception. People on dialup connections have suffered through long load times just to see when the next patch would be, for instance.<p>These folks--as well as others who prefer their pages served without bells and whistles--will rejoice at the new <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/lowsrc/">Low Source</a> version of the EQ Live site. Nathan &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pearce and his band of Web jockeys have taken a gigantic leap back in time to the days of HTML 1.0, when Web pages gave you text without bulky graphics.<p>This is nice, even for those of us on cable modems and DSL lines, because we get the info we want fast--<B>without those annoying pop-up ads on the regular EQ Live site.</B> Get rid of those crappy Intel ads, already.<p><BIG>Monks For Sale</BIG><p>We reported to you earlier that <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/">Monkly Business</a> had decided not to fork over the cash for renewing its Gold status with EZBoard, thus cramming Gator ads down the throat of anyone trying to access the message board. However, a sponsor has come forward to take over ownership of the site and pay for the Gold status.<p>You'd think this would be a good thing that would make monks everywhere jump up and down with glee. Instead, many see it as a dark day for the monk community--and a harbinger of sorrow for player communities everywhere.<p>Why the negative reaction? Because the person taking over the monk site is none other than Jonathan Yantis--who also happens to own Mysupersales.com, a site that sells EQ items for real-world cash.<p>In his first address to the monk community, Yantis <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=34780.topic">tries to assure readers</a> that things will remain pretty much as they have been. The moderators stay the same, the boards stay the same--only a small link to his other site will be on each page. That doesn't sound so bad, right?<p>Well, many monks don't like it. First off, Mysupersales is by its very nature a violation of the EULA, which makes some folks wonder whether SOE employees will give the monk boards less credibility as a result. But more than that, it establishes a dangerous precedent. Will every message board community in trouble be bailed out by a player auction site? Is this some sort of plan to legitimize questionable business practices by putting on a nice-guy face for the player population?<p>Whether this saves the monk community or damns it remains to be seen. Many have seen the Monkly Business site as being in a downward spiral for the past couple of years, as it has gone from an informative and helpful community to an overmoderated twink-fest dominated by rude and selfish players. Other see this simply as a function of the EQ player base as a whole, as overpopulation has brought out the worst in many.<p>Whatever your opinion on the community itself, the arrival of Yantis leaves a bad taste in our mouths. Mobhunter will be keeping an eye out for what effects this might have down the road.<p>Now go eat some pumpkin pie, for heaven's sake.
