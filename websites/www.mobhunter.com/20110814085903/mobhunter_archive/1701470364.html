Will the NPC's be getting the anti-gate spells?<p>Thuldorn</I><p><B>No, NPCs will not be getting this spell (and not so much because we don't want them to, but more for technical reasons). And, no, these spells will not work on player characters in PvP either, for the same technical reasons.<p>Because of the fact that the spell would be a problem to code to work on player characters, we've never needed to discuss whether or not we want it to work on player characters... I think it would be fun, but that's just me. :)<p>Alan</B><p>Absor does like to shake us up every once in a while, doesn't he? Not that evac gets called in many uber-raids anyway, but can't you just picture your friendly neighborhood druid attempting to save the whole party from certain doom only to have some bok shaman charge up and stop her gate?<p>That would really add to my roleplay experience.<p>Anyway, we can all rest easy that--for now, at least--mobs won't be gaining this advantage. I'm keeping my eye on that Poe guy, however.
