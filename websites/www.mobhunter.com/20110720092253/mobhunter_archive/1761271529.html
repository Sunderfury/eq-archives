Previously, especially toward the high end, it's no secret that many caster NPCs were considered free targets. They spent the majority of their time casting ineffective spells, and frequently the same ones over and over again.<p>Originally, they were given exemptions to the normal spellcaster rules to make up for their shortcomings. It only makes sense that the average NPC should be a challenge for the people who can gain experience from its demise. However, we think it should instead feel like they're playing from the same rulebook as player spellcasters. <p>Making them challenging within a similar framework to the one that players use, we feel, provides for more rewarding victories. Conversely, let's face it, the argument, &quot;Of course NPCs cheat -- They're NPCs.&quot; really doesn't make anyone feel better when they've just gotten themselves obliterated. Yes, dying is painful, but doing so in a fair fight is much more tolerable.<p>None of this is an attempt at &quot;Making EverQuest Universally Harder.&quot; We'd like our NPCs be a little smarter than they were previously, yet an encounter with them should still feel challenging, but fair.<p>In last week's patch we introduced a significant enhancement to the &quot;Challenging&quot; half of that, which from observations on the Test server appeared to be mostly fair. However, we feel confident enough in the NPCs' newfound strengths that we've taken a look at some of the special bonuses that they get just for being an NPC.<p>With that in mind, we've internally tested some changes to address the &quot;Fair&quot; half, and they'll be available for public testing on the Test server over the next few days, in the hopes of reaching a balance between player and spellcasting NPC. Ideally, we would like to have a balance which leaves them a challenge; something to be mindful of, but not inordinately unfair. <p>There are some that we're still internally debating, but we all agree that we'd like to see them in action in front of a wider audience before we make any final decisons. <p>* NPCs are now bound by the same Line of Sight rules as player characters. (An NPC must be able to &quot;see&quot; you to hit you with a spell.)<p>* Neither NPCs nor player characters will use mana on targeted spell casts that do not connect due to Line of Sight. <p>* NPCs are now bound by spell casting distance rules. Meaning, an NPC's spell will no longer connect from halfway across the zone. (We want spellcasters to be challenging -- Not a deathtrap that a person has no ability to run away from.)<p>* NPCs now have a chance to be interrupted by normal combat when casting newer spells.<p>* NPCs that are extremely green have had their potential casting damage reduced using a similar mechanic to the one that player characters' level differences use. <p>* NPC Wizards no longer have an inherent bonus to their fire and cold based spells. They appear to be doing just fine on their own.<p>* Most NPCs that had previously had their spellcasting level inflated to make up for poor spell selection have been brought back into line with their actual level.<p>* NPCs no longer automatically get free access to rarely dropped spells, such as Garrison's Superior Sundering and Funeral Pyre of Kelador.<p>* We've begun looking at NPC pure caster hit points and melee damage, and will continue to watch how this plays out over the coming weeks, making adjustments in some cases. Some adjustments are already visible on the test server.<p>Even this balance may not yet be where we'd like it, but please rest assured that it will continue to be tuned. Most of us enjoy playing the game as well, and what we would like to see in our own playtime is NPCs that are a reasonable challenge.</B><p>For all the people who cried about how mobs were made way too tough with the recent NPC caster changes, this list should provide some relief. Once again, these are some realistic changes--NPCs <I>should</I> behave more like people do. Hey, that's the whole idea of artificial intelligence, right?<p>After coming out yesterday in favor of the changes to NPC casters in the last patch (and getting a new anus chewed for my troubles), you may be surprised to find out I am also in favor of these upcoming changes. Why? Because, kiddies... <I>they make sense.</I> Do you get it yet? I'm against both making the game randomly easier <I>and</I> randomly harder--I like major game alterations to have a purpose. Achieving the proper balance between players who cast spells and their NPC counterparts is a worthy purpose indeed.<p>You seem to forget, I play this game, too. And I've cursed as loudly as anyone when trying to get away from some lame caster NPC who somehow has the power to nuke me from 1,000 yards away. Abilities like that aren't fair, and it seems like the game code has finally advanced far enough that such unrealistic crutches are no longer necessary.<p>Now, how about another NPC caster change that makes sense: when a monk/necro/SK successfully feigns death while an NPC is casting on them, the caster should duck and stop casting. Why? Because that's what players do when they see a mob die. If a mob believes the player to be dead, why would they waste precious mana nuking a corpse?<p>Get to work, bagel boy.<p><BIG>It's Not Just for Treehuggers, You Know</BIG><p>Exploration of Jaggedpine Forest continues on Test server, and it turns out that rogues get a little treat. Residents of the Safehouse are <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11268.topic">reporting</a> that yet another illusion mask has turned up--this time half-elf.<p>Rogues got a little snobby in the thread--apparently stooping to become a half-elf really puts them out--but let me remind you all that female half-elves are among the hottest in the game. Can you say &quot;thong&quot;? I knew ya could.<p>Besides, no matter how much they whine about it, you know the rogues will go after those masks anyway. They can't sleep at night unless they have the whole freaking set of illusions. Bards want the masks, too... those dirty lute whores.<p>Get it? &quot;Lute whores&quot;? /giggle<p><BIG>I Don't Give a Damn 'Bout My Reputation</BIG><p>In a catastrophically bad move, Verant has reversed a long-standing policy on not allowing characters to change their first names--as long as you meet their price. Over on the EQLive site, the company's new <a href="https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_renames/">Name Change Service</a> has a Web page that gives the details.<p>The price: $49.95 per account. Unless, of course, you're a Legends subscriber... in which case it's free (and has been for a while).<p>Why is this such a horrible move? Because Verant had it right the first time: the reputation you build in EverQuest should stick with you. Allowing a character to have its name changed--along with a quick face change, which still hasn't been locked down--means that any slimeball who can't get a group due to being universally hated can join the Norrathian witness protection program and start fresh with a new identity.<p>What's more, this decision seems tailor made for those who buy and sell accounts on eBay. Now anyone who obtains an account in this manner can, by and large, escape any negativity that might have driven the owner to sell in the first place. Granted, the character might be recognizable to others because of its equipment; changing my name to &quot;Vakvak&quot; won't help me because I'd still be recognized based on what gear I wear (and also because I'm so damned sexy). For many accounts, though, this wouldn't be an issue.<p>C'mon, Verant. This service is cheesy--and I'm <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=17452.topic">not the only one</a> who thinks so. Some Web-based <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4354">gimmick</a> to look up former names isn't the answer, either. There are only a few legitimate cases where a player's name should be changed (such as being the victim of stalking), and those should be handled by the GM staff for free.<p>What's next... class/race/deity changes--buy two, get one FREE!!!<p><BIG>What Mobhunter Owes You</BIG><p>I take flack here for what I write from time to time, which is to be expected. Despite the fact that we bring you EverQuest news, Mobhunter is mostly an opinion site--and mostly my opinion, at that. Opinions are like... umm, belly buttons--everybody's got one. And when yours clashes with mine, some of you let me know... often in very vocal fashion. And we like that. If we didn't, we wouldn't let you reply to articles.<p>There is, however, a growing misconception of why Mobhunter is here. We've never really drafted a &quot;mission statement,&quot; but if we did, it would probably read something like our link on the EQLive site (which I wrote, btw): <I>The insider's choice for opinions on the news and events in and around Norrath.</I><p>Opinions on news and events--that's what we do. That's what I write. My opinions. Not Verant's. And not yours.<p>Some of you think that if I don't try to antagonize Verant at every turn--or worse yet, if I dare to agree with them--that I'm in their pocket. Since when does agreeing with someone mean that you are kissing up to them? Do you kiss up to everyone with whom you happen to agree on a given topic? If so, there's probably a whole lot of people you better warn to pucker up, because odds are you share an opinion or two with the folks around you.<p>Long ago, someone accused me of selling out in an effort to get a job at Verant--again, because I happened to agree with something the company said. Truth be told, I've never asked Verant for a job, nor have they even hinted at offering me one... despite the frequent and runnning jokes about it. That is not to say I wouldn't love a job in the MMORPG industry--so would you... don't <I>even</I> try to tell me otherwise--because getting paid for what I currently do for free would be fantastic. But I don't compromise what I write in order to make that happen. If Verant or Sigil or Mythic (yeah, right) or those guys making that Shadowbane thing want to hire me, then they can tell me what to write. Until then, I write whatever the hell I want to--and that's what Mobhunter is all about.<p>We're not here to be the champion of your cause. I get e-mail all the time asking me to help such-and-such a class, or to report on a Ragefire KS, or to squeal on some reported abuse by a GM. I always check into these cases, but almost never write about them. Why? Because they usually don't affect the balance of the game--which is always my foremost concern. Sometimes I do pick up a cause this way, as I did in the case of increasing the drop rate on high-end shaman spells. That, I thought, was an issue that <I>did</I> affect game balance adversely, and I was pleased to help address it.<p>So the point to my babbling is this: Mobhunter is not here to be what you, Verant, or anyone else wants us to be. We are, I'm fairly certain, the <B>only</B> major EverQuest site that is 100% independent--we don't have a single advertiser or sponsor to whom we are beholden in any way, nor do we ask you for a donation. Everything we write, we write for ourselves, for our own amusement. Hopefully you will enjoy it as well and can take something useful from it, in which case it was worth your time to visit. If not... well, sorry, but that's just too bad. This is our site, and we do things the way we want to do them.<p>Thanks for reading Mobhunter, and as always, we value your feedback. But I'm not here to kiss anyone's ass--not even yours.
