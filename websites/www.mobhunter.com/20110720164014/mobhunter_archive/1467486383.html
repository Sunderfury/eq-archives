Yep.&quot;<p>I started the massive download early Sunday as I watched the Vikings crash to another humiliating defeat. Sunday night, after my usual dose of EQ, I decided to give Camelot a spin.<p>I tried several times to run the thing, and kept locking up, so I gave up for the night. After consulting with friends, I was told I'd have to disable <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com/">ZoneAlarm</a> to play DAoC. Lame.<p>Monday, after undertaking a post-patch hunt with my guild and finding out how much Yelinak enjoys chomping on my newly uberfied monkly buttocks, I turned off my trusty firewall and entered the world of Camelot.<p>Now, let me make something clear here. I didn't read any help files, and didn't go to any sites to learn how to do anything. I had a rough idea of realms and such, and I knew I wanted to try out a friar, so I picked my realm and set about making my character.<p>I must say, character creation is very slick. It's basically a cooler version of EQ's process. Further, I was very impressed with how the character models looked, and the number of faces available. You can pick your hair color, too.<p>I couldn't make the friar I wanted, though. Only Britons (don't sue me over spelling mistakes, cuz I ain't fixing 'em) can be friars, so I had to settle for a less-exotic Moorgard than I wanted. Anyway, I made my avatar and entered the world.<p>Of Camelot, I can only say this: the screenshots don't do the game justice. The textures and shadows of the landscape are much, much prettier than EverQuest's. The jagginess of Norrath is replaced by a smoother, rounder world. The only really lame thing about the landscape is the trees, which use the old Antonica &quot;X&quot; method attempting to show depth. Boo.<p>I figured out how to look in my inventory. I figured out how to drop my mace and shield on the ground. I figured out--through trial and error--how to pick them up again. Now it was time to fight.<p>I ran outside to get a closer look at the bad guys roaming about. The way the mobs move (I saw some bugs and brownie things) is very smooth. I clicked on a brownie, and was told he was aggressive to me. Cool. ATTACK!<p>erm. ATTACK!!<p>uh... ATTACK!!!<p>Okay, so I had no idea how to attack the damn thing. Why wouldn't the 'A' key work? And herein, boys and girls, is the only bit of design advice I can give to up-and-coming game makers...<p>If you are so obviously and completely trying to duplicate an existing game, and moreover, if your target market is the very people who play said game, then MAKE THE FREAKING COMMANDS THE SAME!!!<p>So there I was, running around the pretty green hills, unable to kill the brownie who was taunting me. About this time, a cutthroat started chasing me and made me quite dead. I floated around a while until the game told me to try the /release command, at which point I was ported back to town. Neat trick, that. The game also told me that /quit would camp me out, which I did. I tried a second character just for kicks, and had similar results.<p>Total time spent in Camelot: about 45 minutes. Is this enough time to evaluate an MMORPG? Of course not. That's why this isn't a review, despite the title of the piece.<p>And I know what you're going to say. &quot;RTFM, gimp, and you would've had a lot of fun!&quot; Maybe that's true. In fact, it probably is. But I guess I was looking for a quick buzz and a furiously low learning curve. DAoC merits more time than I was willing to give it--which, apparently, was 45 minutes.<p>I'm not going to buy the game. Norrath is Moorgard's home, and the home of his friends, so that's where he's staying. But it was fun to run around a new, pretty landscape for a night. Especially considering that I didn't have to pay for it.<p>Okay, DAoC fans, let the catcalls begin!
