				<h2><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=315" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The Crucible Called WAR">The Crucible Called WAR</a></h2>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>I think that Warhammer Online&#8217;s arrival, more so even than Age of Conan&#8217;s, is showing who has <a title="Self-reference is the best!" href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=271" target="_self">outgrown</a> the classic fantasy MMORPG and who still enjoys the genre.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ll preface this by saying I&#8217;M NOT IN THE BETA YET, so I&#8217;m basing my observations off watching the game being played by someone else (*sob*) as well as the posts coming from a variety of bloggers.)</p>
<p>In one corner we have people like <a title="I prefer uncommon sense" href="http://commonsensegamer.com/?p=822" target="_blank">Darren</a> and <a title="Brent's secret is that HE'S A VIRGIN" href="http://www.virginworlds.com/pg.php?n=10103" target="_blank">Brent</a>, who see WAR as offering the same old DIKU gameplay, and (they feel) in most ways not as well as WoW. They are both, however, excited about SOE&#8217;s next batch of games which they feel are bringing some innovation to the MMOG space: FreeRealms, the Agency, and DC Universe Online (and I&#8217;m looking forward to all these games too).</p>
<p>In the other corner we have <a title="He dares to be excited about the game" href="http://www.keenandgraev.com/?p=1334" target="_blank">Keen</a> and others who are happy that WAR seems to be just what they wanted. They cite the almost universally lauded public quests, but for a lot of these people it&#8217;s the RvR alone that will hold their interest long term.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the middle we have <a title="He's always objective, like a robot." href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2008/08/whats-difference.html" target="_blank">Tobold</a> and <a title="What a grouch!" href="http://www.thegrouchygamer.com/?p=147#more-147" target="_blank">Genda</a>, who are taking a more objective stance on what WAR brings to the table. I particularly enjoyed Tobold&#8217;s theory that WAR will do a lot more to foster player community during the leveling process than WoW has by virtue of its social systems.</p>
<p>As I wrote before, it&#8217;s okay for some folks to have grown tired of this type of game. There&#8217;s no shame in saying so. But those same people need to realize that there&#8217;s no shame in enjoying a familiar game style and lauding a few well-thought-out advancements.</p>
<p>Look, WAR is unlikely to win over the average poster at <a title="The epicenter of smarm" href="http://www.f13.net/" target="_blank">f13</a>, because those folks are more jaded than a Chinese gift shop. But I think Warhamer Online is going to do quite well with fans of the genre, so long as it remains as engaging as it seems to be at the lower levels and it doesn&#8217;t feature broken PvP like AoC. I&#8217;ll be particularly interested whether it brings some socialization back to MMOGs, which have increasingly become solo experiences.</p>
<p>Sometimes a little is enough (THAT&#8217;S WHAT SHE SAID&#8230; oops, sorry). MMOGs don&#8217;t have to be revolutionary to be successful, and at the end of the day delivering a few new ideas on top of a polished and familiar core experience may be enough to satisfy a sizable fanbase. Time will tell if this is true of WAR, or if the public as a whole is looking for the same revolution that some longtime gamers are advocating.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m hoping for both.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Both <a title="He's a media superstar!" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/08/19/an-important-nda-announcement/" target="_blank">Scott &#8220;News For Lunch&#8221; Jennings</a> and the MMOG news avalanche that is <a title="In the time you're reading this, they posted 3 more stories" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/08/20/mythic-warhammer-online-contributors-to-go-uncredited/" target="_blank">Massively</a> commented on a <a title="Call me the mad linker" href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54263" target="_blank">Shacknews piece</a> in which Mark Jacobs spoke concerning WAR&#8217;s credits:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Over the years, we&#8217;ve had hundreds of people work on the game, and we thank everyone who helped us bring our Warhammer passion to life, but only current employees that have continued until the end will be credited in the final game.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The article includes comments from a former employee that make things sound a bit shady, but I did want to mention one aspect of this issue that I haven&#8217;t seen brought up yet.</p>
<p>I think contributors who leave a project before launch should be included in the credits, <strong><em>provided that their work is actually present in the product at launch.</em></strong></p>
<p>Many MMOGs are in development for years, and people often come and go from a team during that time for a variety of reasons. Someone might do work on the game early on, or shoddy work along the way, that is later replaced with something better. In such cases, I don&#8217;t think the studio should be required to include that person&#8217;s name in the credits (although nothing will stop such a developer from including the game on his or her resume).</p>
<p>So I wouldn&#8217;t jump to any conclusions based solely on the Shacknews article, because we don&#8217;t know all theÂ  details on the work done by the anonymous former employee cited as a source. But regardless of the circumstances in this case, I am in favor (as you might imagine) of having standards in place so that those who are due credit properly receive it.</p>

					<p>Apparently a new type of mount is being added to WoW in Wrath of the Lich King: <a title="Oi." href="http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=13299.0" target="_blank">the Hog</a>.</p>
<p>Frankly, this type of thing makes it increasingly less likely that I&#8217;ll be interested in playing much WoW after the expansion comes out.</p>
<p>Look, I understand that WoW is full of slapstick gags, puns, and real-world references. It&#8217;s part of the game&#8217;s style, and it certainly has an appeal to many gamers. As much as I hate knowing she&#8217;s in the world, I can ignore Haris Pilton pretty easily. But I won&#8217;t be able to ignore gangs of gnomes riding past me on motorcycles.</p>
<p>The helicopter flying mount made by engineers was pushing it for me. Once Azeroth has the motocycle, what&#8217;s next? When will I be able to get a Hummer to drive around in, or a Maserati? (Come on, just imagine the cross marketing potential!)</p>
<p>Am I the only person in the world who wants to play the game so mesmerizingly portrayed in Blizzard&#8217;s intro cinematics? Frankly, I much prefer that dramatic and awe-inspiring style over the game that actually gets installed on my hard drive. And it gets increasingly harder to pretend I&#8217;m playing that idealized Azeroth when I see stuff like this becoming more prevalent in the game.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>When I was a wee one, I enjoyed watching <a title="If you didn't grow up in Minnesota, you're a heathen" href="http://www.lunchwithcasey.com/" target="_blank">Casey &amp; Roundhouse</a> and <a title="This was before that damn Elmo" href="http://pbskids.org/sesame/" target="_blank">Sesame Street</a>. They were great shows with silly humor that also taught kids a lot of important lessons.</p>
<p>But great as they were, at some point I stopped watching. I didn&#8217;t need to hear songs about the alphabet or counting to ten anymore; I had already learned that stuff. So I moved on to different types of programs.</p>
<p>I have a question, though. Why didn&#8217;t those shows change their format to grow with me? The characters from Sesame Street could all be in their 30s like I am, cracking racy jokes and teaching me about 401k plans and enlarging prostates. I mean, the show has changed a lot, introducing many new characters over the years, but it hasn&#8217;t changed to suit <em>me</em>. What gives?</p>
<p>This is essentially the same question a number of veteran MMO players ask, especially after spending years in a particular game. They say things like &#8220;Blizzard better wake up and change WoW, because giving us more of the same old thing won&#8217;t keep me logging in.&#8221; But these folks have forgotten why Sesame Street has remained vital for so long. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=271#more-271" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>Warhammer Online&#8217;s creative director, one Mr. Paul Barnett, is currently <a title="Oh no he didn't!" href="http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/gdc-is-narrowminded-combative-experience-says-ea-dev--/?biz=1" target="_blank">taking</a> some <a title="Oh yes he did!" href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/barnett-slams-gdc-for-being-combative-and-narrow-minded" target="_blank">heat</a> for comments made in a <a title="Never short on opinions, this one" href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/07/02/barnett-on-why-i-dont-go-to-gdc/" target="_blank">Rock, Paper, Shotgun interview</a> in which he explained why he doesn&#8217;t attend GDC. You&#8217;ll notice that some of the harshest backlash toward Paul is coming from industry press, which benefits from positive buzz for GDC and other shows like it, while <a title="A different opinion" href="http://commonsensegamer.com/?p=736" target="_blank">independent outlets</a> are a bit more sympathetic to what Barnett has to say.</p>
<p><a title="Yeah, quite out of context" href="http://www.destructoid.com/gdc-is-full-of-ultimately-stupid-ideas-says-ea-s-barnett-94012.phtml" target="_blank">Some headlines</a> are taking Barnett&#8217;s comments out of context. He&#8217;s not attacking the show outright (he said <em>some people</em> say things that are stupid, not condemning the entire conference), rather that it isn&#8217;t something he sees personal benefit from attending. I think what Barnett is getting at is that shows like GDC have become far more focused on networking, looking for jobs, peddling middleware, and raising money than on innovative thinking&#8211;something he believes more prominent at shows like LIFT.</p>
<p>But as we&#8217;ve seen lately, those who question industry icons&#8211;regardless of intent&#8211;tend to ruffle feathers and make themselves targets. With all the floundering since the loss of its flagship expo, the video games business remains a bit protective of its institutions. Barnett is just the latest to take heat for questioning the status quo.</p>

					<p>It&#8217;s not often that a single post can be articulate, nerdy, informative, funny, and fascinating all at once, but James Wallis manages to hit every one of those marks in <a title="Good stuff" href="http://www.spaaace.com/cope/?p=111" target="_blank">an article analyzing the virtual world of Azeroth from a scholarly perspective</a>.</p>
<p>As someone who designs the geography of game worlds, I enjoyed the data gathering aspects of this article. And as a writer who appreciates a tongue-in-cheek approach while <a title="An oldy but a goodie" href="http://mobhunter.com/moorgard/292602756.html" target="_blank">sounding</a> very <a title="It's about pooping" href="http://mobhunter.com/moorgard/-376381988.html" target="_self">serious</a>, the post made me chuckle.</p>

<p><em>(Note: The title for this article is drawn from one of the most fabulous posts ever made on the EQ2 forums, which sadly no longer seems to exist. In it, the author was ranting about something and cited a bunch of crazy crap to back up his claims, adding the classic phrase &#8220;Also, I am a scientist.&#8221; Which is brilliant on so many levels, and still makes Shwayder and me chuckle to this day.)</em></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Lots of attention lately has been focused on the quality of writing in MMOs and other games, so I imagine that a number of would-be writers would see this as a great time to jump into the industry. Over on F13&#8217;s game dev board, I <a title="I believe in recycling" href="http://forums.f13.net/index.php?topic=13468.0" target="_blank">responded to a thread</a> started by a poster confused about the term &#8220;narrative designer&#8221; and how that differs from a writer. In the interest of thrift and the desire for relevant blog topics that don&#8217;t have to do with Richard Bartle, I thought I&#8217;d present an updated version of my thoughts here.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. There&#8217;s a huge push right now for telling better stories in MMOs, so naturally most people assume that means hiring really good writers.</p>
<p>But I would point out an important distinction. I think it&#8217;s even more crucial to hire really good <em>storytellers</em>. There&#8217;s a difference. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=233#more-233" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A bit of a nerd fight erupted in the blogosphere recently as a <a title="linkee" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/06/20/richard-bartle-on-how-hed-make-world-of-warcraft-better/" target="_blank">Richard Bartle interview on Massively</a> caused eyebrows to crinkle, and when <a title="How dare you!" href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2008/06/wow.html" target="_blank">some folks</a> <a title="The nerve!" href="http://www.keenandgraev.com/?p=1103" target="_blank">raised questions</a> about Bartle&#8217;s <a title="Tobold = New Guard" href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2008/06/public-figures.html" target="_blank">current</a> <a title="Pompous jackass!" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/06/21/richard-bartle-is-a-hardcore-killer/#comment-37004" target="_blank">relevance</a>, such <a title="Hey look, discussion!" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/06/21/richard-bartle-is-a-hardcore-killer/" target="_blank">discussion</a> was met with <a title="Such a company man!" href="http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=414" target="_blank">rebuttal</a> or <a title="Oh noes, I've been called out!" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/06/21/richard-bartle-is-a-hardcore-killer/#comment-37018" target="_blank">backlash</a>.</p>
<p>What this boils down to is that you have the Old Guard protecting their sacred cows, and the New Guard (many of whom have World of Warcraft as their primary or sole point of reference) questioning their elders. This pattern should sound familiar, because it happens in every generational shift around pretty much every art form. Congratulations to the MMO industry for finally being old enough to have a generational gap!</p>
<p>The Old Guard must come to terms with the fact that this is the natural order of things, and they need to stop getting pissy about it. Youth questions its elders; that&#8217;s how progress happens. People should stop feeling like they need to pounce on anyone who dares question Bartle&#8217;s position in history, for <a title="Moooooooooo" href="http://waaagh.wordpress.com/2008/06/21/im-feeling-snarky/#comment-968" target="_blank">as he himself noted in a response to this mess</a>, he&#8217;s relevant for as long as people think he is and are willing to pay him for his input. That seems fair to me.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m at it, there are two other old school truisms I&#8217;d like to take some shots at. Hey, I&#8217;m on a roll, so why not? <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=235#more-235" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>It took only hours for the <a title="Let the weirdness begin" href="http://www.spore.com/ftl" target="_blank">Spore creature creator</a> to be used to make <a title="Makes me feel dirty, and not in a good way." href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/?p=1947" target="_blank">very unsafe for work, very disturbing porn-like images</a> known as &#8220;Sporn.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to believe that Will Wright knew this would happen. After all, everyone knows that porn drives all things on the Internet. But I wonder if he realized how quickly we&#8217;d see giant penises shooting purple clouds or multi-legged creatures seemingly self-fertilizing themselves.</p>
