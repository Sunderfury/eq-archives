		<description><![CDATA[Very very cool Steve. You were one of my favorite devs at SOE. I don&#039;t care for the Landmark workshop as I believe it boarders the fine line of speculative work, but I loved watching it when you were going to be on just to listen to your lore stories. I wish Landmark could have had more lore. 

I am thrilled to see you at Blizzard. I played wow for 10 years (vanilla high warlord hunter) and quit this year because removing scatter shot, hunters mark, scare beast and pet abilities was too much for me, those spells are iconic to the class and it just felt boring without them. Your employment at Blizzard though gives me a reason to come back. 

What I find ironic, is that the Blizzard Wow juggernaut just got stronger with you. I love some of the people at Daybreak, but really....they dont stand a chance now. Good luck man, I wish you the best :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice! WoW could use some fresh faces right now, with the seeming lack of content; especially after blizzard announced that they have doubles their team. I suspect that many are working on future expansions, but the current one needs to live up to its hype. Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations, Moorgard!  I have been following you since the Original EQ days on this site, and I&#039;m thrilled you&#039;ll be leaving your mark on World of Warcraft.  I would really encourage you to consider how disorganized players are abandoning the game in droves now and the impact that this has to the community ecosystem of Azeroth. The recent remedies appear to be focused just on building more organized gameplay, but rewarding solo content and pick-up content that could easily translate into a casual, high-performing raiding experience is what made Wrath of the Lich King the high watermark for WoW.  I hope you will use your influence as a Game Designer to build rewarding solo content that is not soul-crushingly repetitive and grindy. Best of luck to you!]]></description>

Glad you found something quickly, and with Blizzard no less :)  Been a quietly lurking cheerleader of yours since the early EQ2 days, and especially through the whole Copernicus phase.  Looking forward to see what you do in phase four.]]></description>
