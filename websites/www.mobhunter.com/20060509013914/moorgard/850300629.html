Personally, last night was my worst since the day of the launch--massive packet loss, two system crashes, frame rates of the 3-5 per second variety... it flat-out sucked.<p>Well, another tip has surfaced that might finally offer some relief. No, this didn't come from Verant, though it was <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/016658.html">posted</a> on the Technical Help board. Take a peek at this potential fix for sound and frame rate issues, courtesy of a player named Kikai:<p><B>I got this from another thread (Thanks, jimala!), tried it, and it improved my sound tremendously. I still have some snap, crackle, pop, but overall, it sounds MUCH better. I haven't been able to stay on long enough to see if it does away with the frame lag/sound lag issues I've been having, but I DID stay on long enough to have a sword and spell battle with an earth elemental during a thunderstorm, and it sounded fantastic! Try it, and see what it does for you!<p>&quot;Q: My game starts slowing down or stuttering and the hourglass spins constantly, making gameplay almost unbearable at times! What can I do?<br>A: Microsoft left the Debug Mode activated in Directx 8 and 8a for DirectSound. This consumes vast quantities of CPU cycles, and also increases the possibility for creating software/hardware conflicts.<br>Download the Microsoft DirectX Control Panel applet:<br><a href="http://www.gamevoiceclub.com/Download/dxapplet.zip"> http://www.gamevoiceclub.com/Download/dxapplet.zip</a><br>Extract to:<br>....WindowsSystem<br>go into Control Panel, click on your (newly installed) DX applet go to the DirectSound tab and slide the debug slider all the way to the left to disable debug mode. reboot your computer and restart the game.<br>Note: This works with DX 8.1 but very occasionally it may already be switched off in that version.<br>While this has been shown to help those experiencing mild to crippling stutter-chop problems while using DirectX 8, it has also helped clear up graphical anomalies and sound conflicts.&quot;</b><p>I'm on this stupid Macintosh at work, so I can't personally verify how well this fix works, but posts in the thread indicate a lot of promise.<p>Soundblaster cards have historically been a cause of system problems. While in this case Microsoft appears to bear some of the blame, don't let Creative off the hook. Unlike the video card market--which updates its drivers on a very consistent basis--Creative tends to release a sound card driver, with maybe one revision, and then forgets about it.<p>Creative's drivers aren't stable enough to sit for a year or more without updates. Unfortunately, there isn't enough competition in the sound card market to make them sweat much if their drivers get out of date. Just another example of poor customer treatment in this industry.<p>Anyway, I'll try the fix tonight and see if it helps the crap performance I've been getting.<p><BIG>You Don't Say...</big><p>Rogues don't just complain about nerfs and such. Sometimes they just like to have fun conversations--even with NPCs.<p>Over in the Safehouse forums, folks noticed some interesting <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9183.topic">NPC dialogue</a> that has been popping up in certain Luclin zones. The rogue class's best friend at Verant--the man known as Kendrick--had this to say on the matter:<p><B>I put 410 unique agro, death, and victory messages in Sanctus Seru. That's 410x3.<p>Collect them all!</b><p>I get lost in the multiplication tables somewhere around 4 x 5, but this sounds like a lot of emotes to me. If only I had some mechanical device that could <a href="http://home01.wxs.nl/~bigwilly/picz/britneys_breasts.swf">calculate numbers</a> for me...<p><BIG>Wizards Whining? Way!</big><p>Not all casters complain, but a few seem to be vocal enough to create an unfortunate stereotype known as the Whiney Caster. Take wizards, for example. For some, it's not enough that their class does massive damage and has the greatest port utility in the game. This unhappy minority of wizards vocally complains about any change that could impact their class in any way--even if it saves them harassment by us poor melees.<p>Thus, a few members of the glass-is-half-full crew managed to see the addition of Soulbinders as an <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=10516.topic">attack by Verant</a> upon some sacred cow of casterdom. Despite the fact that receiving requests for binds has been cited as an annoyance by many casters over the years, now suddenly it's a treasured player interaction that's meant to be savored. Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed in the message board thread, as well as in a similar <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=26177.topic">druid discussion</a>.<p>Take a deep breath. Adding melee binding in city zones does not destroy the balance of the game. Okay, exhale. Now move along.<p><BIG>Curse Thee, Foul Paladin</big><p>A new <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13545.topic">remove curse spell</a> has been found to drop off a named mushroom in Echo Caverns, and this has paladins excited (then again, it doesn't take much to get a pally going--I think it's that whole vow-of-chastity thing).<p>While the exact uses of this spell aren't known, we're all hoping that it will take care of some of those nasty DoTs that Luclin boss mobs seem to have--you know, 10,000,000 damage over 100,000 ticks and such.<p>Personally, I think it's a shame that clerics, shamans, and druids can also scribe this spell. It would be neat for paladins to have more unique utility roles in game, and removing nasty spell effects would certainly be one of them.<p><BIG>Stocking Stuffers</big><p>I could have hidden these links and been all subtle-like, but I decided to be giving, considering the season and all.<p>Just when you think we know everything about our planet, something <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1551/912879.html">big and scary</a> comes along to remind us humans that we ain't so tough. The depths of the ocean contain many forms of life that we have absolutely no clue about, but it's beginning to look like Jules Verne knew what he was talking about after all.<p>Many of you have probably seen <I>The Lord of the Rings</i> already, and helped contribute to the <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/eo/20011221/en/_quot_lord_of_the_rings_quot_rings_up_millions_1.html">mad cash</a> the film raked in on its first day. As if EverQuest didn't draw enough inspiration from Tolkien's epic, the folks who do those PvP comics have found <a href="http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20011220">another way</a> to unite these two cultural phenomena. Thanks for the chuckle, folks.
