Sure enough, some new animations turned up on Test server briefly that were met mostly with mixed reviews. That's why we were surprised to log in the other day and see a patch message on the live servers:<p><B>We have updated the Run, Walk and Turn animations for the Luclin models.  As you can tell, new animations require a lot of data.  We're sorry for the size of the update, but we think you'll like the changes.</b><p>Well, not many people were really complaining about how they looked when they ran, walked, or turned, but we figured hey, it's a start. Then we looked at some of the animations...<p>Uhhhhhh.<p>Iksars ran like chickens. Most other races ran like apes. Barbarians ran so oddly that their facial hair didn't want to stay attached to their faces. High elves were doing this crazy shoulder rotation thing that I can't even describe to you.<p>Later that night, we got yet another patch message:<p><B>We apologize for this second download today, however, incorrect versions of these animation files were sent in the transition between test and live.<p>We hope to have this matter straightened out in the next couple days, and will likely tweak a couple animations due to the community's reaction while we're at it.  <p>Once you've finished downloading, everything should be as it was before today with the exception of Dwarven Males and Gnomish Females.  Those will not automatically revert if you updated EverQuest earlier today.</b><p>Oops indeed. The 28.8 crowd isn't happy that they'll be patching those files a third time, so hopefully the results will be worth it. Admittedly, I did like the new human running animation, but walking was just a slightly slowed down version of the same thing. When turning I kind of looked like I was doing the <A HREF="http://www.songexpressions.net/curly.html">Curly Shuffle</a>, but then I never had a problem with the way I turned before.<p>As we've stated numerous times, what we're all really waiting for is new combat animations. But this is an okay start, and as long as our facial hair stays attached, we can adapt to pretty much any style of running that SOE can dream up.<p>I think we're all just kind of spoiled by the way character models move in upcoming games like EQ2 and WoW. The next generation of MMORPGs is going to have some <I>sweet</i> combat moves.<p><BIG>Any Port in a Storm</big><p>Over on the monk board, a <A HREF="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=39844.topic">problem</a> has come to light that some users are unable to zone into Plane of Tactics. Turns out the issue is linked to what port number SOE is using:<p><B>Plane of Tactics can use UDP port 1434 for connections (apparently, zone servers chooes semi-random port upon startup).<p>That is the same port by MS SQL Server (and related software like MSDE). A worm, called &quot;SQL Slammer&quot;, propogated via a SQL Server vulnerability and cause quite a mess on the internet. Some ISPs chose to close UDP 1434 in response.<p>I called Verizon support and verified they have blocked this port. Further, they have no plans or timetable for reopening it.<p>PoTactics is now 100% inaccessible to some players, and will remain so as long as Microsoft, the ISPs, and SoE keep pointing fingers at each other instead of fixing the problem.<p>Edit: also other zones, if you zone and suddenly get disconnected--- that is EQ chosing port 1433 or 1434.... </b><p>Just to be clear, I'm no network guru; that's what I have Kohath around for. So I asked him to clarify that mess, and he elaborated:<p><B>Basically, the Plane of Tactics is using the same &quot;signature&quot; (technically a port number) as the SQL Slammer worm.  The SQL slammer worm was the fastest-spreading virus in Internet history. It caused widespread problems, including making large parts of the Internet unusable.  As a result, many ISPs have chosen to specifically disable communications using this signature.  The Plane of Tactics is unavailable to people using those ISPs.</b><p>Be sure to thank Kohath for writing his first Mobhunter contribution in about a year.<p>For those who are as network challenged as yours truly, <A HREF="http://www.camden411.com/tcpipfaq/ports.html">ports</a> are like numbered doorways that servers and PCs talk through. Certain ports have somewhat predetermined functions, while others are basically open. But ISPs or firewalls can block certain port ranges, which can cause communication problems between systems. And that's what's happening here.<p>Lenardo from the monk board brought the matter to Scott Hartsman's attention, and Hartsman provided a response:<p><B>We do already know about the port issues.  There are actually many more than 1434 that are blocked.  <br> <br>The problem is that whenever we pick a new port range, we end up with a bigger problem.  As an example, when we moved to 9000-9100 where no known problems exist, a couple weeks ago, we ended up with 5% of the test players not being able to connect.  <br> <br>We'll be moving to a different static range sometime in the near future, that's hopefully compatible with everyone's provider.  Finding that range has been quite the challenge.</b><p>Ah, the fun of the Internet. I'm completely the wrong guy to offer a solution to this problem, but I'm sure some of you tech geeks--er, I mean network gurus--reading this will be able to post some meaningful responses below.<p>I'm just gonna go watch myself run while you do that. Wheeeeeeeee!<p><BIG>King of Thieves--and Disconnects</big><p>Speaking of connection woes, folks over on the Bristlebane server seem to be having more than their share. During US prime-time hours, disconnects are leading to rampant 1017 errors, to the point where many users are finding EQ almost unplayable. The SOE types on the Technical Help board are <A HREF="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/042976.html">investigating</a>, but nothing concrete has turned up yet. The issue is clearly on Sony's side, not that of the end users.<p>This has been a problem for a month or so, and it's not just limited to Bristlebane. On my home server, the relatively uncrowded Xev, a few players run into this problem periodically. More common lately is one of the symptoms that 1017s are on the way: when there's a 15-second lag between the time you send a tell and the time you see it onscreen, it's an omen that a disconnect might be approaching. I've had guildmates go linkdead and be unable to log in for a while, until finally coming back to find themselves reverted to their last save position. Most of us on Xev never see it get much worse than that, but people on other servers are reporting varying levels of severity.<p>Until the cause is isolated, we don't have much more than speculation as to the cause. But you might want to keep your fingers and toes crossed in the hopes that the problems don't become more widespread.<p>Then again, this might all just be a bad joke on the part of Bristlebane himself. You know, kind of like how he made his home plane all sucky and stuff.<p><BIG>The Art of Talking While Saying Very Little</big><p>It seems like ages since Brad McQuaid slipped the surly bonds of Sony and ventured off to do his own thing by forming Sigil Games Online with Jeff Butler and other ex-EQ types. Since then, Sigil has kept a pretty low profile, aside from hiring away some old-school devs to join the new team. But recently the silence has been broken... at least sorta.<p>Sigil's site has a <a href="http://www.sigilgames.com/000067.php">new interview with Brad</a> in which Verant's former honcho talks mostly about game design theory. But what about the specifics of the company's first product? This is as much as you're going to get:<p><B>Soon, I promise! We're dying to start talking too, trust me. Some of the best times I had developing EQ were interacting with and supporting the player community - I look forward to returning to this role (as do many other Sigil people).</b><p>Sounds like something will be announced Real Soon Now(TM), which could mean anytime this decade. Actually, I'd anticipate an announcement before EQ2 hits the shelves and before WoW threatens to enter some kind of actual beta. It would seem to be a good idea to get word of Sigil's new game out in the marketplace before the hype of the next crop of games threatens to drown it out. Expect Sigil to tip its hand in the next few months.<p>C'mon, Bradmeister, show us what you got!<p><BIG>The Lynch Mob Rides Again</big><p>Speaking of stuff that sucks, yet another <A HREF="http://www.lcsun-news.com/Stories/0,1413,115%257E7444%257E1456835,00.html">badly written piece of crap</a> masquerading as a legitimate news story surfaced recently, with some <A HREF="mailto:jsimmons@lcsun-news.com">yahoo</a> from a New Mexico newspaper/site yammering on about how evil EverQuest is. I mean, check out this gem of a quote:<p><B>For most, video games are a temporary way to escape from life. But for some of the 400,000 people who play EverQuest, it becomes their life.</b><p>Hey, <A HREF="http://www.local6.com/news/2277296/detail.html">pinhead</a>, not <I>everyone</i> who plays EQ is a freaking addict. Sure, I am, and everyone in my guild is, but I've met some folks here and there who...<p>Er, anyway, I hate to even draw attention to this junk, but it still gets under my skin. So feel free to drop this joker a line and let him know that you aren't nearly as much of a loser as he makes you out to be. Also be sure to point out that he's writing his &quot;news&quot; in New Mexico of all places, and with his thimble-full of talent he isn't likely to get a job anywhere else soon. Although you might suggest he apply at the <I>New York Times.</i>
