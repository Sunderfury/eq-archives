Verant uses this server to see how new spells will impact the existing game, so expect lots of tweaks and fine-tuning with all of them.<p>Here's some highlights discovered so far for a few different classes.<p><a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=4fb6cd483cf6e273d8aad956cfdf9261&amp;threadid=27921"><B>Rangers</B></a>:<p>Hawk Eye <br>Classes: Rng (L15) <br>Skill: Instantaneous <p>Named Ranger's Defense <br>Damage Shield by 2 (L30) <br>Increase Armor Class (AC) from 11 (L30) to 12 (L40) <br>Classes: Rng (L30) <p>Natures Precision <br>Increase Attack (ATK) by 15 (L39) <br>Classes: Rng (L39) <p>Falcon Eye <br>Classes: Rng (L52) <p>Call of the Falcon <br>Classes: Rng (L54) <br>Spell cast on you: Your arrows buzz with an avian presence. <p>Mark of the Predator <br>Increase Attack (ATK) by 20 (L56) <br>Classes: Rng (L56) <br>Allowable Targets: Full Group <p>Eagle Eye <br>Classes: Rng (L58) <p>Named Ranger's Protection <br>Increase Current Hitpoints by 150 (L60) <br>Damage Shield by 6 (L60) <br>Increase Armor Class (AC) by 33 (L60) <br>Increase Total Hit Points by 150 (L60) <br>Classes: Rng (L60) <br>Allowable Targets: All <p>Rangers would get some pretty nice upgrades here. The level 60 Protection spell is a nice upgrade to Call of Earth. Rumors persist of a lure-based snare, but rangers are still tracking that ellusive beast.<p><a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=5433.topic"><B>Wizards</B></a>:<p>O'Keils Embers (12) - 3 pt. damage shield/10 fire resist<br>Summon Minor Familiar(19)<br>Elnerick Entombment of Ice (34) - root with 300ish damage<br>Summon Lesser Familar(49)<br>Summon Familiar(54)<br>Decession (56) - evac to (-1,-1) in zone<br>Garrison's Roaming Vision (58) - perhaps an Eye of Zomm upgrade<br>Summon Greater Familiar(60)<p>There is some speculation on what a &quot;familiar&quot; is going to be. Most wizards don't want a pet, but would prefer a familiar to be a creature that follows them around (though they can't give it commands) and either performs tasks, buffs, or enhances the wizard's mana pool in some way. There will also, of course, be the Luclin teleport spell(s), but any port spells won't count against the 10 new class spells promised.<p><a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=f784a8ac44040cefacad4d3e1cb55bce&amp;threadid=14898">Shamans</a>:<p>Shaman spells found include a low-level group strength buff, grow (look for giant gnomes blocking the exit of Sol B), a low-level bear form, a level 49 Focus variant, a combination disease and poison cure, a new poison direct damage spell, a new group regrowth (2 levels before druids get theirs), a new poison DoT, and group Focus and SoW.<p>Sounds like < level 50 shamans are please, > level 50 shamans are not. From my experience, shamans want to slow mobs better, and nothing along those lines has surfaced yet.<p>Some other tidbits:<p>Enchanters get a new metal enchantment: Luclinite. Let dreams of 7 AC/75 HP rings commence.<p>Shadow Knights have a new line of spells called the 'Scream' line. It is unkown if <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Friends/bios/Courteney_Cox_Arquette.html">Courtney Cox Arquette</a> has anything to do with it.<p>Druids get a group version of the 'Skin' spells. More impressively, they get a spell called Heirophants Preservation, a level 58 spell that apparently stops corpse decay.<p>Necros get spells that slow undead. An interesting twist and a useful addition to their abilities, perhaps. Since not many epic mobs are undead, though, this may just turn out to be another tool to solo in Lower Guk.<br>
