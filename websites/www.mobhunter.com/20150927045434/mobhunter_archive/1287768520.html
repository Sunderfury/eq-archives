Maybe</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-04-23</p><BIG>The Sequel Cometh?</BIG><p>Last week you no doubt read our <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=695683699">report</a> on the mysterious new Web sites that surfaced after following a trail of breadcrumbs started in Verant's most recent newsletter. This trail lead to two rather interesting places: <a href="http://www.nektulos.com/">www.nektulos.com</a> and <a href="http://www.wailingcaves.com/">www.wailingcaves.com</a>. The sites herald a big announcement coming in May, and provide a <a href="http://ojaste.dhs.org/~shariin/images/nektulos2.jpg">pretty picture</a> or <a href="http://ojaste.dhs.org/~shariin/images/wailing.jpg">two</a>.<p>Speculation has raged on what these portents mean. Could they be for a new zone? A new expansion? Or something more?<p>We're gonna go with the last choice, and we'll tell you why.<p>One of our readers posted a very interesting <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=589254886&amp;msgid=1493819732#message">tidbit</a> when replying to yesterday's update (see, you should read those messages after all):<p><B>PC Gamer just released this months issue with Everquest2 article. www.neriak.com and www.wailingcaves.com are EQ2 URL's.<br>Its being released Oct 2003, and NO you cant import your EQ char to EQ2. Level cap is 100.</B><p>That in and of itself (especially from an anonymous poster) doesn't qualify as cold, hard facts. But we're betting Mr. Anonymous is right on the money--just follow that trail of evidence.<p><B>1. The Big Announcment in May.</B> New zones--especially freebies--don't rate their own Web sites. These sites don't have anything to do with the Planes of Power, and Verant isn't going to announce another expansion with one already in the works. The PS2 game has already been announced, so it can't be that. There has to be a new product in the works.<p><B>2. The Images.</B> At first those pretty pictures look like paintings, or maybe renderings. But we're betting those are <I>screenshots</I>. Impossible, you say? Do the lighting and shadows seem way too perfect? Think again. Take a look at the <a href="http://starwarsgalaxies.station.sony.com/media/screenshots.jsp">Star Wars Galaxies screenshots</a> if you haven't lately. There is some absolutely incredible graphics work being done for this game, and Verant's next RPG flagship product would have imagery on the same level.<p><B>3. The Poems.</B> If you look at the poem included in the Verant newsletter, you'll notice it mentions that &quot;A new world will beckon / No longer concealed.&quot; Since the PS2 game is not technically a new world, and it has been announced already, these lines don't work at all. Plus, the poem at the Nektulos site tells you to &quot;Prepare for a future yet to unfold.&quot; The PS2 game is set in the past. What is the future? EverQuest 2.<p><B>4. The Strategy.</B> While EverQuest plus another expansion or two would be a viable product for some time, it can't last forever. The Luclin engine may be robust enough to trounce Dark Age of Camelot and other current competition, but it's not going to stand up to <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a>, <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/screenshots.asp?id=3224">Asheron's Call 2</a>, and whatever it is that Brad McQuaid's <a href="http://www.sigilgames.com/">Sigil Games Online</a> has in the works. Yes, EverQuest 2 would be in direct competition with EverQuest, but it's much wiser for Verant to move its customers from one product to another rather than sit around while its customer base gets poached by other companies.<p>The claim about PC Gamer has some credibility, too. It's not uncommon for game companies to give &quot;exclusives&quot; to certain gaming magazines, and Verant has worked with PC Gamer before. The next issue of the magazine is due in early May, which would coincide with the May timeline that the Nektulos site provided. Aside from Mr. Anonymous, has anyone else out there gotten this advance copy of PC Gamer? If not, one might wonder if we have someone from the magazine staff reading our site and feeling the desire to contribute.<p>While this is all just speculation, of course, the facts do add up. Thus, Mobhunter is going out on a limb and predicting that next month Verant will announce EverQuest 2 on the heels of a feature article in PC Gamer. If we're wrong, you can shackle us in the town square and pelt us with tomatoes. But if we're right... aw hell, you'll probably pelt us with tomatoes anyway.<p><BIG>Triton Takes Down The Emperor</BIG><p>Povar's resident uberguild, <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/">Triton</a>, has been stalking the Emperor in Ssra Temple for a while now. What's taken so long? Because the timesink--er, I mean strategy--that Verant devised for killing this big bad mob requires the use of Shissar bane weapons, which require agonizingly long camps to obtain in and of themselves.<p>Well, last night my former servermates managed to finally take the snake down, and phat lewts followed. More importantly, the last big piece to the Vex Thal key was found, as <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10813.topic">confirmed</a> by my homegirl Kastrina. Expect &quot;/who all Triton&quot; to list members in Vex Thal before too long. Grats, Triton.<p>Now the Emperor officially falls into the category of mobs that no longer qualify as news when they die, so don't bother telling us about it if your server manages to use the l337 strategy that Zaar provides to whip the snake.<p>Hmmm, that sounds kinda dirty.<p><BIG>Prayers and Whispers</BIG><p>Casters Realm <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4241">talked to</a> Rich Waters--you know, the guy handling spells since Lawrence Poe moved over to the EverQuest 2 team /wink--about recent the shaman slow aggro bug:<p><B>When we changed the melee slow spells to be removable with Cure Disease, it had the side effect of increasing the amount of hate that was generated when you slowed a monster.  To fix this, we've added a hate reduction effect to the spell to bring it back down to the hate it used to cause when you cast it.  When this version of the spell goes live, it will generate the same amount of hate it used to before we added the disease component, but still be removable with Cure Disease.</B><p>Waters also commented on the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=589254886">spell changes</a> that recently surfaced on Test server:<p><B>The 'Portal' spells are another project and won't be castable by players. <p>The 'Prayer' spells are associated with some new trade skill work we're doing.   I've just added over a thousand recipes to various tradeskills, and expect to see those go live in a couple weeks.  These new recipes expand on various cultural tradeskills, fill in some gaps in tradeskill progression, and raise the bar significantly for grandmaster tradesfolk.  Many of the new recipes create items of a much higher quality than previously available, and I expect they'll be in high demand.    <p>In addition to the recipes I added, Yakatizma has plans to smooth out the skill gain progression and make some adjustments to the trivial levels of many older recipes.</B><p>The trade skill folks will be happy to hear that. We need more player-crafted items that are actually useful.<p>Okay, that's it for today. Let the pelting commence.<br>
