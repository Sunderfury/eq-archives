		<description>I haven&#039;t seen the new Clash of the Titans yet but I share your sentiments in regards to the original movie. As a child, I was completely enthralled with the storyline. My roommate rented the old one recently and I only watched the very beginning and was surprised by how different it seemed. I like to think that I&#039;m an imaginative person, but I doubt that I&#039;ll ever be as creative as when I was a little kid. Sometimes, the less you know, the more you see. And that&#039;s why being a noob in EQ or WoW is much more exciting than creating an alt. Faydark used to be a mysterious place to explore. Trying to find my corpse in the dark after being killed by a pixie trickster was terrifying (not an exaggeration), despite being only a few yards away from Felwithe. Whenever I return to Faydark, it&#039;s as though it&#039;s lost most of it&#039;s magic, it&#039;s character. MMOs need to find a way to keep players in that kid full of wonder mode because the best stories are &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; the ones told by NPCs.</description>

		<description>Absolutely agree. Nostaliga is such a powerful thing. I tried playing Anarchy Online again last year and I gave up after battling for hours trying to get my controls and UI to work the way I wanted. I couldn&#039;t even figure out how to zoom out :( I guess we just take too much for granted these days and lament about the &quot;good ol&#039; days&quot; with clouded judgement :)</description>

		<description>So far I&#039;m seeing about 50% of fond childhood memories as still being &quot;quality&quot; today. The ones that are still cool are nice to see every once and a while. The ones that aren&#039;t can be very depressing, as in: wow, what was I thinking.

Clash, I still like, mainly because I enjoy the art of special effects without computers.

Voltron ... cool tech, cool toys, but wow, what awful plotlines.

The Hobbit ... ouch.

Secret of Nimh ...  Awesome.</description>

		<description>I remember very early EQ Abashi (the original Community Rep) commenting that everquest was a chat channel where you played a game between conversations. 

I remember my fun times with people and places far more then the &quot;event&quot; being fun itself. I&#039;d venture to say some of my most memorable times were doing things like wiping to idiots aggroing CT in fear or dying because someone opened the HoT door in Temple of Veeshan not the actual dynamic of the game.

I think if WoW has one epic failure it&#039;s the lack of community it fosters. The game is so fast paced and so &quot;button mashing&quot; that it discourages people to get to know each other, maintain regular groups and build up those &quot;relationships.&quot;

Oh on the topic... I loved the movie The Dark Crystal growing up and always considered it truly great... but rewatching it now I think I remember the excitement of being a kid and seeing it through those eyes more then the actual movie being great.</description>

		<description>Ha!  I was reluctant to see the remake because I recalled the horrid original, but I thought the remake was great.  Those scorpions!  Medusa in her burning pit of a home.  Sam Worthington is a far superior hero than  *eek* Harry Hamlin could be.  I can&#039;t resist Liam Neeson in anything either. The Kraken was horribly done though.</description>

		<description>I was underwhelmed by the new Clash.  It wasn&#039;t the look of the film: I rather liked some of the set pieces (Olympus and Medusa&#039;s Lair) and action sequences (Scorpions) which took the original Clash and took their concept to the next level.  It was the hurried middle act really disappointed me.  You&#039;ve been introduced to this motley crew of soldiers and mercenaries who are only given just enough background and dialog to make their eventual danger/sacrifice a fraction more meaningful than a Star Trek red shirt.  It&#039;s disappointing, to say the least.

I wasn&#039;t expecting Fellowship of the Rings, but I wanted to spend more questing with those men, the hero, exploring their relationships and the world around them, and not just rushed to away to a CG finale that felt anything but epic.</description>

		<description>It&#039;s a shame the new movie apparently (I haven&#039;t seen it yet) tries and fails to rewrite the original for today&#039;s &quot;perceived&quot; audience. The original CotT might be dated and a little corny, but I really enjoyed the story and the characters. Oh and the music! I&#039;m 50 minutes in on my refresher watch, I don&#039;t even feel it is as dated as you say, Moorgard. It just....added whimsy and heart to an epic and brutal tale.

I do concur with your ultimate conclusion, though. I have tried to return to the ghosts of MMO&#039;s past. It is never as you remember. We simply aren&#039;t the same gamers we once were. The landscape has forever changed. It&#039;s sad in a way. I&#039;m just gonna blame WoW.</description>

		<description>I, like you, love the original Clash. And I&#039;ve watched it as recently as this past summer. Yes, it&#039;s a bit corny, but it tells a great story. I thought Massawyrm, from AICN, wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aintitcool.com/node/44470&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;one of the better reviews on the new Clash of the Titans&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The original CLASH is a love story, an adventure about a boy, born of a god and a mortal, who sets out to find his destiny only to find it in the eyes of the world’s most beautiful woman. So he sets out to win the heart and hand of that woman by going on one of the greatest adventure’s ever embarked upon. He must, when all is said and done, kill a fellow demi-god, behead a Gorgon and slay the Kraken – all in the name of love.&quot;

This version of CLASH, on the other hand, is not at all about love. It’s the story of a boy who is very angry at his dad. After watching his loving adopted father killed by his real dad’s evil brother, he sets out to murder the gods – which tangentially causes him to want to save Andromeda – but not because he likes her. Instead, killing the Gorgon will weaken Hades and allow Perseus to kill him personally. What follows is a series of action sequences in which Sam Worthington (playing Jake Sully without the wheelchair) runs around bitching about his dad and refusing the gifts and favors of the gods while everyone around him (essentially substitute Argonauts) are killed off brutally while begging him to stop being such a whiny bitch and just accept their help.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Stephen King is fond of saying and writing, Story is king. 

End of discussion.</description>
