Since these files are quite large, we will only be placing one per day on the patcher.  It is recommended that you patch Velious daily to avoid having to download them all at once.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>What will the changes be? Hard to say. I wouldn't expect anything sweeping, but who knows.<p>Fashion victims like me are biting our fingernails with anticipation.<br><hr align=center width="90%" size=0><p><b>Update:</b> According to Kendrick, the gist of the new armor is <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousecontractsbountiesjobsquestsetc.showMessage?topicID=2348.topic"><big>no more man boobs!</big></a>.  Hooray! (Kendrick is on the dev team.) - Kohath<br><hr align=center width="90%" size=0><p><b>Update: Boobless armor confirmed<p>All you have to do is run the Velious patcher. As the message says, the files are kinda big, so if you plan to patch, it's probably a good idea to do it each time you log in, so you can get the data in smaller bunches.<p>The patch is mostly to fix the, um... protrusions... on some of the male Velious breastplates. We're removing the 'man boobs' from some of the armors.<p>Alan</b><p>Thanks Alan - Kohath
