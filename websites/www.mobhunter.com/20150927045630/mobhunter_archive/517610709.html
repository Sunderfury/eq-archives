The estimated downtime is 5 hours.</B><p>Hopefully this one occurs as planned.<p><BIG>Still Waters Run Deep</BIG><p>Rich Waters--designer and producer of various things in the EQ universe--was kind enough to answer a couple questions for us recently. First, we wanted to clarify why the 4/1 patch was cancelled:<p><B>We delayed the patch to hammer out a few bugs with the new pathing and hate code - both those systems impact the game globally and we wanted to take the time to make sure they were working very well.  With fan faire, we had a big interruption in our normal testing and dev time and didn't want to rush such big changes.</B><p>Pundits proclaiming the patch put-off as some grand April Fool's joke will have to find conspiracies elsewhere, I guess. Personally, I find the notion of taking an extra week to test such major gameplay changes to be somewhat comforting.<p>You may recall that last week some <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2003-04-01%2002:00:12">interesting new effects</a> showed up on Lucy that looked an awful lot like melee abilities. With names like Power Bash, Savage Kick, and Sturdiness, these entries grant a variety of attacks, damage shields, and defensive capabilities. We asked Rich what the story was:<p><B>The melee-looking effects on Test server are related to some research one of the designers is doing to improve the variety of interesting loot for melee classes.  He's got some good ideas that we're hoping to use to spice up the effects for characters who are maxing out in all the standard areas. If we get a set we're happy with, we're likely to add them to end-game bosses first since that's where the lack of variety for melees is most pronounced.</B><p>Those who had been hoping for revamped disciplines or new AA abilities will probably be disappointed, and no doubt the playah hatahs will cry that SOE is once again catering to the uber crowd by adding these effects to end-game loot first. The decision to try it this way is logical, however, given the fact that most melee in high-end encounters are finding themselves with literally no role due to the devastating AE effects and rampage that a lot of boss mobs use. By tuning the high end and balancing downward, they can hopefully avoid major balance problems along the way.<p>It's difficult to tell from the Lucy summaries exactly how much of an impact these new effects would have on the game, but anything to spice up content for the melee classes would be most welcome. After playing EQOA, I've just about convinced myself that the best course of action would be to add a mana bar to all melee classes and tie various abilities to it. Doing so would add variety to the game and would require more strategy than simply where to stand and when to hit the autoattack button. While such a change sounds like a major alteration to gameplay, it really isn't any more startling than many other changes introduced in the last couple years.<p>Finally, Waters offered this comment about how easily miscommunications can occur after a FanFaire:<p><B>Fan faire's panels are interesting things.  The game is so large and complex, it's hard for any single developer to know the definitive intent and answer for all the questions that may randomly come up.  In house, we work as a team with several specialists.  When people encounter a question they can't answer in daily work, they can always ask someone else on the team who does know.  That's a luxury that we don't have available at fan faire.  Add to that the potential confusion from miscommunication or misinterpretation of some answers, and what makes it back to message boards is often not exactly the information we hoped to present.  I'd like to find better ways of communicating with players this year, as I think that's very good for everyone involved.</B><p>Clearly, Absor needs to get off his butt and type transcripts faster--or they need to hire an intern or something to do the grunt work. Basically, anything that shortens the time between what we <I>heard</I> was said and what <I>actually</I> was said would be a good start.<p>Thanks to Rich Waters for taking the time to respond to us.<p><BIG>A Beastly New Home</BIG><p>Those who had been lamenting the fact that the beastlord message board has been missing in action will be relieved to know that a <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/feqbeastlordfrm1">temporary replacement</a> is in place until their PHHB board can be resuscitated. If you have existing links to the old message board you might as well delete them, as the reconstructed board will have a new URL.<p>In other message board news, we just got word of a new <a href="http://www.rodcetnife.org/">Rodcet Nife</a> community, as well as a new hangout for <a href="http://pub62.ezboard.com/bfeigned29111">uber monks</a> to trade secrets.<p>The latter board, by the way, is not to be confused with <a href="http://www.feigndeath.com/">Feign Death</a>, a monk board that sprang up after the Yantis buyout of Monkly Business. FD did just as its name implies when it failed to draw much attention or many users, though it still exists today. Maybe a <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=30814.topic&amp;index=72">recent statement</a> from Absor making it clear that he won't post on MB while Yantis owns it will drive some action Feign Death's way, or perhaps rumors of negotiations to drive the big Y out of monksville will prove true and allow Alan to talk directly to monkeys once again.<p><BIG>Bayle-ing Us Out</BIG><p>You may recall that in a <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-1078152027">recent story</a> we mentioned the problems that the Kane Bayle server was having in regards to zone crashes, particularly with Vex Thal. We received this update from Greldon, the leader of one of the KB guilds affected by the problem:<p><B>I can't thank you enough for bringing up the issue. surprisingly enough, they did some maintenance on the zonebox. Now the 5 zones on that box do not crash anymore, and for the first time we've cleared vt with no crash. Now, 4 new zones started crashing repeatedly, but i could not care less if burningwoods/akeva/letalis/maidens eye crash like hell now =p (i bet they just swapped the zones from a faulty computer to a working one)</B><p>While we would hope that <I>none</I> of the KB zones would consistently be crashing, we're glad if we helped bring the issue some attention. Hopefully the questionable hardware is replaced so the entire server can be stable.<p>That's it for today. The article may be short, but hey, it's cheaper than a Sunday paper.
