Got any pictures? Did you have fun?<p><B>Plenty of interesting ideas. I've already compiled a summary and passed it on to the team.<p>I didn't take pictures, and avoided being in any when I could. Hopefully we'll have some up on our web site soon...<p>Everyone from SOE that attended seemed to have had a great time. I know I did.</B><p>I guess the SoE contingent wasn't being camped by those Tallon Zek PKers. Glad to hear it, Alan.<p><BIG>If You Can't Login, Go Watch a Sitcom</BIG><p>No server outage this week, but there is a brief bit of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000469.html">downtime</a> tonight:<p><B>On Tuesday, January 29th, at 1AM PST, (9AM GMT), the Login Server will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. No new logins will be allowed during this downtime however those already in game will not be affected and should be able to play normally. The estimated downtime is 30 minutes.<p>The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>Not that there's much point in reporting this, since by the time most of you read it, the login server will be back up.<p>At least, <I>that's what they want you to think...</I> [insert evil laugh here]<p><BIG>I've Got a Title by the Tail It's Plain to See</BIG><p>Absor posted <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000470.html">at length</a> on Dev Corner regarding the AAXP title debacle that affected poor <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-2101121781">Master Bahter</a>.<p><B>Scott is talking about a switch that the GMs can use to correct issues like the one that Bahter has. He's not talking about a switch that would allow players to turn off their titles. Those are two different issues. In this case we need the GM switch to correct this naming issue (though I suspect it only affects a single or a very small number of players), so that such players are not inconvenienced by the introduction of these titles. Allowing players to turn off their titles doesn't solve the problem, it actually would make it worse. This would allow a player (and I'm certainly not saying that Bahter would do this) to toggle on and off the combination, which allows that combination to exist against the naming policy. We need to be assured that the name can't exist.<p>That means that even if we had both a player and a GM toggle for titles, the GM toggle would overwrite the player one. A GM could toggle off Bahter's title (Master) and the player would not be able to turn it back on.<p>So, with all of the other stuff we're working on right now, the GM one would have to come first.<p>I hope that made sense.</B><p>What about the whole /shownames command thing?<p><B>There are some switches now available for those that want to customize how other people's names appear.<p>The problem for Bahter is that his title needs to not display to anyone, regardless of their setting. It can't be dependent on how others set their names, but on how his name looks to everyone. So it has to be set for his character, regardless who sees him.<p>...<p>This works on what you see, not what you show to others. A subtle but important difference.</B><p>So if I ask real nicely, will a GM turn off my title for me?<p><B>Absolutely not. When this feature is added for the GMs, it will only be used for the rare instance of the character with a name that violates the naming policy when combined with a title. It's not a very efficient use of our GMs time to run around turning off titles.<p>Alan</B><p>Wow, I bet that's more than you ever wanted to know about AAXP titles. It's pretty clear that a tad more thought should have gone into the whole system; after all, I shouldn't have to show a title if I don't want to (and I don't). Ah well, now that some naughty names are turning up courtesy of these titles, I'm sure the fix will be in soon. This takes time away from the team fixing bard issues, of course, but that's a pretty fair trade.<p><BIG>Take My Horse--Please!</BIG><p>Players who wanted to get rid of their horses found the new NPCs in the Bazaar who talk about buying bridles, but were confused by the fact that these NPCs aren't merchants. Turns out selling your horse requires a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000472.html">quest</a>:<p><B>The NPCs that talk to you about purchasing your bridle are not merchants. They are quest NPCs. Each of them tells you which bridles he will take. You just hand him the right kind and he'll give you an item of value that you can sell to a vendor.</B><p>Absor continued the horse news by addressing a player's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000473.html">concerns</a> that his horse isn't living up to expectations:<p><B><I>I read about the comment here about the cost of horse and that a horse is more of a status rather than an upgrade. Well thats pretty fine with me.<br>But still there are some issues of which , levitation will not work on them, /follow still boots us to desktop, people cannot cast beneficial buffs on me they get a message i am too far away even if i am next to them, we cannot drag corpse, If you start casting a spell you cannot interupt it exept you have to move around to stop it casting.<br>I mean i paid like 32k for this horse , i striped down 2 of my twinks to get it, I am not asking these to be fixed now but at least give us an update with all the bugs they got. <p>Trex Della`Vallett</I><p>You can now levitate on a horse (or, better, with a horse). Changed last patch.<br>/follow no longer boots people. Fixed last patch.<br>The out of range thing is being looked at.<br>I'll mention the corpse thing, I'm not sure if you're supposed to be able to drag them or not on a horse.<br>The duck thing is being looked into.<p>Alan</B><p>We were worried that selling broken horsies might be <a href="http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&amp;query=Enron+Ethics">unethical</a>, but it seems like any outstanding issues will be taken care of soon.<p>There you have it, an all-Absor News Roundup. Was it thrilling? No. Death-defying? No. But at least it wasn't <a href="http://slate.msn.com/default.aspx?id=2061246&amp;device=">total crap</a>... we hope.
