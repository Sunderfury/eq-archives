				<div class="entry">
					<p>The inaugural <a title="Summit up, yo!" href="http://www.gamexpo.us/summit/" target="_blank">GameX Industry Summit</a> last weekend was a great time. Naturally there were a few hiccups&#8211;being the first time the show was held&#8211;but the content of the event was terrific.</p>
<p>A few of my favorite bits were the Saturday afternoon keynote by Chris Foster of Harmonix, a post mortem on cinematics work by Coray Seifert of Kaos Studios, and a talk on the motivations behind acquiring virtual goods by Bernard Yee of CaféMom.com.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the best talk was the panel I was on, moderated by Alexander Macris of  Themis Group and featuring Damon Alberts of  Burst Online Entertainment and Lee Hammock of Fallen Earth. In all seriousness, our varied backgrounds made for a very diverse panel. The similarities in our answers were as interesting as the different perspectives each of us brought to the table. Alexander did a great job moderating and taking input from the audience. The crowd was really engaged and asking some great questions.</p>
<p>I enjoy shows that include a mix of industry and fans, and this summit had a nice balance. I got to meet some cool industry types but also got to hang out with some students and others who&#8217;d like to get into the industry. Hopefully I had some worthwhile advice for a few of them.</p>
<p>I was also surprised by how much activity there was on the expo floor. There were some honest-to-goodness game show booths there for titles like Dante&#8217;s Inferno, as well as online celebrities such as several members of the Guild. There were a lot of people who came just to hang out and play games, which is always neat to see.</p>
<p>The facility and surrounding area were a bit on the dismal side (no places that sold a real cheesesteak close by), so hopefully if the show is a success they can move to a better spot next year. But even as if it stays in the same location, I recommend the event highly. With PAX East debuting next year, the east coast is gaining ground as a major center of gaming.

					<p>Friday I head down to Philadelphia to attend the <a title="My first rated X summit!" href="http://www.gamexpo.us/summit/" target="_blank">GameX Industry Summit</a>. I&#8217;ll be on a panel Saturday at 4pm titled &#8220;<a title="Longest. Title. Ever." href="http://www.gamexpo.us/summit/details.html#right_1024_1600" target="_blank">Beyond Raids and Ganks: Exploring Next-Gen MMOs   in a non WoW-Killer Context</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>What will I be talking about? How to build a WoW killer, of course!</p>
<p>Okay, not really. Here is the panel description:</p>
<blockquote><p>The MMO is here to stay! Having said that, there is an industry push to introduce new paradigms that take the genre beyond the status quo. In what ways can we create MMOs that innovate within the genre, create new player experiences, and develop deeper, more impacting stories, narrations, and character development? This panel brings together developers working on three new MMOs that are pushing boundaries and innovating beyond established concepts. The panelists will discuss the strengths of the MMO format and then break into how they view the MMO developing, through player experiences, new &#8220;success&#8221; metrics, hybridization of genres, targeted gameplay approaches and developments in story and character.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dang. Hopefully they invited me along to lighten things up with my razor-sharp wit.</p>
<p>Anyway, it should be a fun time and I look forward to meeting my fellow panelists. I won&#8217;t know many folks there, so if you happen to be attending please flag me down and say hello. I&#8217;m usually in a much better mood than I appear, so don&#8217;t be afraid!

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There has been a recent round of blog posts suggesting that current MMOs have <a title="Typical explorer" href="http://www.psychochild.org/?p=810" target="_blank">lost something</a>, that they <a title="Can't afford to squander what you're not prepared to pay" href="http://www.frogdice.com/muckbeast/game_design/the-squandered-potential-of-mmos.html" target="_blank">aren&#8217;t living up to their potential</a>, are in <a title="The revolution will be televised" href="http://tishtoshtesh.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/death-grip-on-the-reins/" target="_blank">desperate need of a revolution</a>, and that power-mad developers are trying to <a title="Use the Force, dude" href="http://tishtoshtesh.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/death-grip-on-the-reins/" target="_blank">lock players on a limited path</a>. Of course, these assertions aren&#8217;t anything new&#8211;posters on entrenched message boards like <a title="Abandon all hope, oh ye who enter" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/" target="_blank">FoH</a> have been saying the same thing for years.</p>
<p>Certainly there is room for entirely new styles of massively multiplayer online games to be developed. We <em>need </em>this kind of development to happen. But the fact is that the Diku MMO is here to stay, if for no other reason that it&#8217;s a popular style of game that millions of people around the world have proven willing to pay money for. So look, just stop whining that the genre is exhausted and out of ideas, because <em>it doesn&#8217;t matter</em>&#8211;even if there are jaded gamers who have had enough of the format and should <a title="Yes, I mean every single one of you" href="http://forums.f13.net/index.php?board=45.0" target="_blank">just move on already</a>, there are millions of new players waiting to take their places.</p>
<p>Rather than abandoning hope for the Diku MMO&#8211;which is about as likely to disappear from the gaming landscape as the FPS&#8211;we should look for ways to address its <a title="Ferrel always has an opinion" href="http://www.epicslant.com/2009/10/problem-with-quest-grind/" target="_blank">shortcomings</a>.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t that there are a lot of quests in these games; it&#8217;s that the quests are often boring, non-heroic, and the only legitimate path of advancement. Worse still, quests in some current titles actually penalize socialization because updates don&#8217;t apply to the whole group. And nobody enjoys ganking a named creature in the wild only to reach a quest hub and receive a mission to kill that very same beastie.</p>
<p>These are solvable problems. Let&#8217;s not do away with the game content Achievers love; let&#8217;s stop penalizing Explorers and Socializers instead. By being thoughtful about our methods of delivering achievement, we should actually feed exploration and socialization. Reward people for encountering mysteries in the wild. Create settings that foster a variety of adventuring outside the linear quest line.</p>
<p>Another topic that comes up a lot is how current MMOs have removed all sense of danger and risk. Again, this is a problem we can solve without going in a completely ridiculous and reckless direction. Simply walking outside the borders of your home town needn&#8217;t mean that everything your character has ever earned is on the line (don&#8217;t worry&#8211;those of you who enjoy that sort of thing will always have niche PvP games to play for however many months of lifespan those titles have). Punitive death penalties may please the hardcore, but they are one of the primary reasons players leave a game.</p>
<p>Instead, find other stakes with real consequences that players can fight for. Make them overcome huge obstacles with a real chance of loss&#8211;but loss that makes them feel like they really tried and want to do better next time, not a loss that makes them feel stupid or unskilled.</p>
<p>Look, a lot of this comes down to content, and making content is expensive&#8211;believe me, I know. But MMO makers are just going to have to bite the bullet on this one. If you read between the lines and pay attention to what the developers of tomorrow&#8217;s MMOs are telling you, several companies are working on addressing these challenges in their own ways (such as BioWare, Trion, and, yes, 38 Studios). There is no universal solution, but developers are trying new things.</p>
<p>While some teams will focus on taking the MMO into bold new directions, others will try to build upon what has proven to work and make it even better. This genre has room for both revolution and evolution, and in fact needs both paths to thrive. Pushing boundaries is healthy, but throwing out the baby with the bathwater would ultimately undermine the considerable progress MMOs have made since the late 1990s.

					<p><a title="Elephants have big poop" href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2009/10/story-of-elephant-sculpture.html" target="_blank">Tobold</a> and <a title="Really big poop" href="http://syncaine.wordpress.com/2009/09/30/your-mmo-wont-have-a-million-subs-sorry-blizzard/" target="_blank">Syncaine</a> are having a debate as to whether the great unannounced MMO from Blizzard will reach a million subs. Both make some interesting points, but of course neither will be proven correct for a long time.</p>
<p>I think both arguments are missing a key element, though.</p>
<p>Especially for those of us who have been playing MMOs for ten years now, we tend to think of the audience as being fairly static. As with most forms of entertainment, it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>If the success of the second <em>Star Wars</em> movie trilogy had been predicated on the response to those of us who grew up with the original three films, the newer movies would have been failures or modest successes (after all, many original fans were disappointed in them). On the contrary, the films were huge hits. Why? Because there was a whole new audience that embraced them&#8211;yes, even Jar Jar.</p>
<p>My friend and colleague Bob Salvatore has written a lot of books about dark elves. If his sales were confined to the same people buying every single one of them, he wouldn&#8217;t keep ending up on the New York Times best-seller list. He does. Why? Because new generations of readers are buying his books. While he also retains many readers, his audience is constantly renewed.</p>
<p>Blizzard&#8217;s next MMO project will be a huge success. Why? Because (unless something completely uncharacteristic happens) they will release a very polished game that is a lot of fun to play. Will the 11 million players of WoW buy it? It won&#8217;t matter&#8211;there will be a whole new generation of MMO players who will. Whether it&#8217;s future gamers who are kids now but won&#8217;t be in a few years, or those who feel WoW is too old and entrenched to be appealing, or those who just don&#8217;t care for the Warcraft franchise&#8211; there are a ton of people who will be ready to try something fresh and new.</p>
<p>This is the same reason why the fantasy Diku MMO still works. Jaded gamers on message boards may tire of them, but the genre&#8217;s proven appeal will continue to resonate with new gamers coming into the space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fashionable to complain about Hollywood or the games industry revisiting the same ideas time and again. But the truth is, there are new audience members entering the marketplace of ideas all the time, and what is well-tread ground to you is an open road to them.
