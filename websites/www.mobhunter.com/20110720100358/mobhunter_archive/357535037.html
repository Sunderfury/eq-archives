Weakling of News Updates</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-01-16</p><BIG>Holy Swords, Batman!</BIG><p>Absor made an un-holy <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000456.html">announcement</a> yesterday:<p><B>We have reviewed Ghoulbane and SoulFire and will be making some changes to these items with the next patch.<p>Ghoulbane will become No Drop and SoulFire will require the proper Race/Class to activate.<p>We wanted to make you aware of these changes before we made them. These weapons are really intended to be holy weapons, and these changes should make them exclusive to Paladins. We will also be reviewing the quest to make certain that it is working after the patch.<p>Alan</B><p>While most of us yawned and turned on <I>Oprah,</I> paladins started <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13928.topic">buzzing</a>. Of course, it took about 4 minutes for the thread to deteriorate into a discussion about why their epic sucks, why Verant hates paladins, etc.<p>Why make these changes at this point? Well, the Ghoulbane change is probably because it's now a quest sword, and most quest results are nodrop. As for Soulfire, the change is more of a nerf to a l33t powergamer tactic. See, Soulfire comes with several charges of Complete Heal, and the item can be activated from inventory. That means anyone who does the quest and gets a Soulfire can cast CH--something that comes in handy in certain high-end encounters and PvP situations. By changing this item, Verant causes no harm to paladins yet eliminates a questionable healing tactic.<p>It's kind of too bad that Verant has to spend time on quests that are years old while so much new content remains to be addressed, but we'd probably get a response about how &quot;those issues are being addressed by two totally different teams&quot; or something. The cynical among you will comment on how Verant never misses an opportunity to nerf a l33t powergamer.<p>Well, go on--say it!<p><BIG>Bazaar Happenings</BIG><p>No, there isn't any word on when the Bazaar functionality will be implemented. Players have been promised the ability to buy and sell in autonomous fashion for a while now, but most of us have been unsure of how exactly this upcoming feature is going to work.<p>I guess we should have been paying more attention. The Mage Compendium has had a <a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/Commands/Bazaar_Commands.htm">list of Bazaar commands</a> up for some time, and it certainly looks interesting. Personally, I'd love to see some sort of graphical front end for doing searches (a window that would allow you to check boxes or select from drop-downs, for example) to avoid lots of typing. But whatever the format, it will be neat when we have it.<p>One change that has happened to the Bazaar--at least on Test--was submitted to us by a reader named Finkle:<p><B>Not sure if you guys already know, but on the test server there are currently new NPCs in the stables in the bazaar. When hailed, they ask if you are selling <insert color here> horse and they will give you a fair price. I couldn't get any response after that though =/.</B><br> <br>Sounds like Kohath's <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-289594857">plea</a> for a horse return policy may be coming to fruition. As with all things on Test, of course, time will tell.<p><BIG>The Other Butler Did It</BIG><p>We got word from a source in the guide program that Michelle Butler--wife of EQ's former producer, Jeff--has stepped down from her postion as a manager of Verant's customer service department.<p>We're not clear whether Mrs. Butler has accepted another position at Verant/SoE, or if she has left to join her husband in Brad McQuaid's <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=2104502843">new venture</a>. In fact, we don't know if leaving was her idea or Verant's. But whatever the case, we'll miss her hard work.<p>Verant hasn't confirmed this story, of course--but then, they still haven't announced Jeff's departure. Not that a company typically makes a big deal out of it when an employee quits, but well, you know how we reporters like confirmation and all.<p>Aw hell, someone at the Safehouse will probably just say we stole the story from them anyway.<p><B>*** Update ***</B><p>A little birdy sent me the following via e-mail concerning Michelle Butler's job:<p><B>I can confirm that she is actually taking a position in the Development team at SOE/Verant on &quot;An exciting new Project&quot; (Direct quote from her) ... she posted the above quote prominently on the guide board.</B><p>Exciting new project? Hmm...<p>By the way, notice how I keep my sources confidential? If you have important news, can prove it's legit, and ask for anonymity, I won't rat you out. In fact, I'm immune to most forms of torture, thanks to those years I spent in prison. So <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">drop me a line</a> anytime you've got the inside story.
