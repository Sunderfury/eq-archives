			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to post a few points of clarification about the Copernicus (Kingdoms of Amalur) teaser that was recently <a title="leaky pants" href="http://kotaku.com/5924410/the-trailer-you-werent-supposed-to-see-for-a-game-youll-never-play" target="_blank">leaked to Kotaku</a>. After we released the environment fly-through video in the last days of 38 Studios, there were a lot of misconceptions about what the video was intended to be, and I don&#8217;t want the same fate to befall this piece.</p>
<ul>
<li>This teaser video was a work in progress, from the illustrations to the game footage to the audio. It was a rough cut to get the pacing right; pretty much every asset would have been reworked or replaced by the time it went final. In fact, there were some tweaks to the script that had been made, but we never got around to recording the updated read-through.</li>
<li>The finished teaser was intended to be released at the time of the MMO&#8217;s announcement. It likely would have been accompanied by a video of gameplay footage, or possibly with a live hands-on demo depending on when and where it was first revealed.</li>
<li>The logo at the end was based upon the <a title="it's Wikipedia, so it must be right" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros" target="_blank">ouroboros</a>, an ancient symbol of the cyclical nature of the universe. This symbol has great significance to the story of Amalur, a world trapped in an unending cycle of creation and destruction. And yes, we had this symbol before the Elder Scrolls Online announced using a similar logo (that&#8217;s what you get for basing your IP on classic themes).</li>
<li>The illustrated style showcased in the teaser was something you would have seen throughout the game. Our cinematics team was packed with amazing illustrators, and we were using animation like this to introduce our races and tell little bits of history you&#8217;d encounter as you traveled through Amalur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing this video posted online gives me a mix of emotions. On the one hand, I love this teaser and am very proud of the work it represents. On the other hand, it makes me sad to be faced once more by what could have been.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to get these points across because it would be unfair to the cinematics or audio teams for anyone seeing this to think it represented a final version of a trailer. Even though it&#8217;s really cool, it would have been spectacular by the time we were done with it. I wish you could see it with the same context we did on the inside of the studio, through the eyes of a passionate team that wanted to make something really special.</p>
<p>I still miss that world something fierce.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of today, everyone at 38 Studios Providence and Baltimore has been laid off.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very sad end to nearly six years of great work. Despite the odds, I believed in the dream we all shared. I believed with all my heart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure the public will ever know the beauty of what we built&#8230; that&#8217;s maybe the hardest part of it all. We snuck out a pretty, but dated, environment fly-through and a few key images, but there is so much more that would take your breath away. I truly hope you get to see it, in some form.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what will happen to Amalur. It will no doubt be tied up in various legal proceedings for some time, both game assets and the intellectual property as a whole.</p>
<p>As people lay blame and the commentators turn a heartbreaking situation into the latest industry punchline, some will probably portray the team as a bunch of screw-ups who couldn&#8217;t ship a game. The story has so, so much more to it than that. In short order, you will start hearing truths, half-truths, and lies, as well as things that are true from a certain perspective. In the end, perspectives are what makes up history&#8230; real truth lies in the midst of it somewhere.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday I&#8217;ll talk more about my perspective&#8230; but not today.</p>
<p>Today, I mourn for what almost was. Because believe it or not, we came <em>so close </em>to pulling it off.</p>
<p>On to the next dream.</p>

<p>This is just a glimpse of the world of Amalur as it comes alive in our MMO, codenamed Project Copernicus.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t get around much anymore&#8211;in blog posts, I mean. But hey, as long as I can stay ahead of <a title="Lazier than I am!" href="http://www.hartsman.com/" target="_blank">Hartsman</a> (who, as a big-money executive, does no actual work and thus lacks any excuse for not blogging), I figure I&#8217;m doing okay.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m headed down to New York Comic Con this week for a panel scheduled on Friday at 1:30 pm called <a title="Come one, come all" href="http://nycc11.mapyourshow.com/5_0/sessions/sessiondetails.cfm?ScheduledSessionID=1BAFC8" target="_blank">Creating a World Worth Saving</a>. I&#8217;ll be joining our own Creator of Worlds, R.A. Salvatore, plus Andrew Auseon and Ian Frazier from the <a title="Hey, you can preorder it" href="http://www.reckoning.com" target="_blank">Reckoning</a> team. We&#8217;ll talk both theory and practice of how you develop a world meant to span a whole ecosystem of products, and in specific about how we used those principles to craft the narrative of the RPG.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still <em>slightly </em>too early to reveal hard facts about our MMO, but I&#8217;ll sneak some storyline tidbits in there. Until our PR guy tackles me and drags me from the stage, that is.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I&#8217;m headed back to the Big Apple with several 38 Studios cohorts to take part in a <a title="hells yeah" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/62128" target="_blank">panel discussion</a> at <a title="NYCC" href="http://www.nycomiccon.com/App/homepage.cfm?moduleid=2577&amp;appname=100453" target="_blank">New York Comic Con</a>. The theme of the panel is &#8220;MMO Development: Year Two.&#8221; It&#8217;s a follow-up to last year&#8217;s panel in which we talked about, uh, year one of the studio.</p>
<p>So this raises the question of exactly why we&#8217;re travelling to the heart of Yankee country when we&#8217;ve made clear that we&#8217;re not going to unveil the details of Copernicus this year. Well, first of all, Ten Ton Hammer asked us to do it and we like those guys. Second, it gives the MMOG fan a peek behind the curtains at how development works. Finally, its Comic Con! We&#8217;re geeks at heart and love to soak it all in.</p>
<p>If you happen to be attending the show and would like to say hello, our panel starts at 1:45pm on Saturday. I&#8217;ll be wearing my <a title="You know you want to see it" href="http://the-adventurers-club.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/adam_hughes_power_girl3_1.jpg" target="_blank">Power Girl</a> costume.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="If you don't like what you read at Massively, wait 3 minutes and they'll have a new article up" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/07/30/comic-con-08-38-studios-interview-reveals-ip-announcement-next/" target="_blank">Massively has posted their interview with 38 Studios</a>, featuring Mary Kirchoff (VP of Marketing) and Thom Ang (Art Director).</p>
<p>This article is largely focused on marketing and big-picture plans for the studio. I thought Mary had a couple really good quotes, such as this response to why we&#8217;re doing a fantasy game:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our other perspective on fantasy is that it&#8217;s the most globally accepted medium for conveying epic stories. It&#8217;s accepted over the broadest number of categories in book publishing, which is one of the categories we&#8217;re going to develop our intellectual property inside. We want consumers to enjoy that experience of being in the world 24/7 in different contexts. Fantasy delivers to a global, broad market – just like 38 Studios.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As for when the game name and more detail on the IP will be forthcoming, Mary talked about that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our current plan is to announce the name of the game and launch the IP website (as opposed to the corporate website) about this time next year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the phrase &#8220;our current plan.&#8221; A lot can change in a year, so don&#8217;t get too worked up if those plans change.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The folks at Ten Ton Hammer also spent some time with the 38 Studios crew at Comic Con, and <a title="Ten tons, and what do you get?" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/39993" target="_blank">wrote up a nice interview</a> in which Scott Cuthbertson (VP of Creative Development) and Thom Ang (Art Director) discussed the art style of Copernicus.</p>
<p>Of course, every gamer knows that what gets created in concept often doesn&#8217;t wind up looking the same way in game. Thom addressed this point well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thom added, “One of the things that we’re doing to ensure this does translate into the actual game environment is that the concept artists who did this are actually the modelers. They’re taking their own paintings and, as artists they’re amazing, but as modelers and world builders they’re also amazing. They’re not having to hand this off to trust someone else to interpret it&#8230; They’re doing their own efficiency tests on it, so they’re involved from the beginning all the way through to end delivery.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For you detail-oriented types, it&#8217;s worth noting that the TTH article included the captions that yours truly wrote for the postcards, but the Zam interview I linked yesterday did not. We&#8217;ll make sure the missing captions get out there.</p>

<p>No, this isn&#8217;t the opening of the information floodgates&#8211;we intend to go back to being quiet for a while. But the convention was a fitting opportunity to show off some of the amazing work of our artists, so we did. Hope you enjoy them.</p>
