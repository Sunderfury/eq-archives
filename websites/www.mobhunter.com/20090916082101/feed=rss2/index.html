			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From my 10th floor hotel room, it seems like I can see about a thousand miles. Austin is flatter and greener than I expected. Also more humid, which may explain the green.</p>
<p>Our AGDC presentation is at 1:30pm Tuesday. Owlchick and I spent the afternoon polishing the slides (yeah yeah, we were supposed to have the final version done a couple weeks ago) so I think it will go well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to lunch with Hartsman and hope to see other old friends from SOE. Should be a good time.</p>
<p>If the presentation tanks, at least there will be BBQ. Oh yes, there will be BBQ.</p>

<p>Anyway, I spent part of my weekend on a panel at the inaugural <a title="Arguably one of the worst designed websites you'll ever see" href="http://www.gameunicon.com/" target="_blank">GameUnicon</a> here in Massachusetts. I was joined by my cohort <a href="http://www.nerfbat.com/">Shwayder</a> and <a title="No, not the BBC chap, although he is British" href="http://elvishparsley.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Justin Webb</a> from <a title="The OTHER MMO developer in Maynard" href="http://www.tencentboston.com/" target="_blank">Tencent Boston</a>. We had an excellent discussion with the seven people in the audience (only one of which was a spouse!).</p>
<p>As proof of our awesomeness at the event, here is a video that Justin and Angela put together.</p>

Now imagine a line connecting them which is made up of similar drawings, each becoming gradually more stylized.  Somewhere along that line, the mushroom will become indistinguishable from the penis.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced that there are some game artists for whom the ultimate quest is finding that point. I can&#8217;t explain why. But somebody needs to come up with a name for this phenomenon.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend and colleague Jason Roberts (Dymus) is generally a man of few words, so when he says something, it&#8217;s worth your time to listen. He recently made <a title="It's just about the only thing worthwhile in the whole thread" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/24711-green-monster-games-curt-schilling-475.html#post1467589" target="_blank">a post in the 38 thread on FoH</a> which merits further attention, so I am quoting it here. His post was in response to the notion that &#8220;the Next Generation of MMOs is coming&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m quite literal and thus a generation is defined by an iteration and building upon the best of what came before. Since MMO&#8217;s take roughly 5-6 years from inception to completion let&#8217;s use that with the overlap. Given that, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re in the midst of generation 2 and working on generation 3. I&#8217;m also keeping the focus to subscription and &#8216;classic&#8217; style MMO&#8217;s, adding the other branches gets unmanageable and I want to stick to one family tree.</p>
<p>Generation 0:  IRC, play by e-mail, web games, MUD&#8217;s (This is obvious)</p>
<p>Generation 1: (1999-2004) Asheron&#8217;s Call, EverQuest, Ultima Online, Meridian 59, Dark Age of Camelot, Anarchy Online, and others.</p>
<p>Generation 2: (2003-2008) World of Warcraft, EVE Online, EverQuest II, Warhammer, Conan, Star Wars Galaxies, Final Fantasy, Matrix Online, City of Heroes, Vanguard, and several others.</p>
<p>Generation 3: (2009-2014) Whatever Blizzard is making, Star Wars: Old Republic, Whatever Carbine is making, Heroes of Telara, whatever else Trion is making, Copernicus, and others.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s play evolution&#8230;<br />
<strong>Generation 1</strong>: There were three main models that passed on their genes &#8212; Ultima Online, EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot. There were traits that the second generation inherited from all the other games but the primary evolutions in generation 2 came from those three.</p>
<p>What did generation 1 teach us? MMO&#8217;s work. Playing with other people is fun. Raiding is cool. Organized PvP is cool. Emergent gameplay is not always a bad thing. Among a whole host of other things, but it was all new.</p>
<p><strong>Generation 2</strong>: What defines generation 2 is a refinement of the main ideas from the prior generation. In this, one game had one very key adaptation: Accessibility. Other evolutions happened they just were not as successful.</p>
<p>But what has Generation 2 taught us? People like to play &#8216;around&#8217; others but not necessarily always &#8216;with&#8217; others. Accessibility and polish are of critical importance when there are choices. Focus on what your game IS not what it COULD be. (A corollary is that radically changing a game mid-flight is probably a bad idea). Building massive worlds and system generated content to fill them is bad.</p>
<p><strong>Generation 3</strong>: We&#8217;re just starting here. But there are now two generations to learn from. Not all the ideas from generation 1 were refined in generation 2 since they were so overshadowed by the one big adaptation of Accessibility and polish. I think those are a given by now, if you don&#8217;t have that adaptation you can&#8217;t compete in the natural selection. The question is, will Generation 3 hit on anything like that adaptation and be a clear trait to carry forward? Perhaps&#8230; a lot of us are guessing what it could be, and it might be that there is more than a single answer.</p>
<p>What do I think generation 3 teach us? Story (personal and world focused) is more important than people guessed. You can successfully apply the working models to more genres than fantasy. You can make a massively single player game and still be successful. If you don&#8217;t seriously include socialization as a goal you&#8217;ll have a serious retention problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people are still quick to throw the tired phrase &#8220;next gen&#8221; around. When I was community manager on EQ2, I had to constantly hear a certain game being touted as &#8220;third gen&#8221; without any substantive merit as to what that meant, so I really like Jason&#8217;s delineation. It&#8217;s not about technology or platform, but about key adaptations and innovations. After all, building Pong with fancy 3D assets doesn&#8217;t make it a next-gen game. Truly ushering in a new generation is about building upon what went before and adding both polish and some interesting new twists.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is going to get a little link-crazy, so pay attention.</p>
<p>Over in <a title="They love that Scott guy" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/39576-scott-hartsman-gallenite-free-agent.html" target="_blank">a thread on FoH</a> about <a title="Bio" href="http://www.hartsman.com/about/" target="_blank">Scott Hartsman</a> <a title="Obai" href="http://www.hartsman.com/2009/07/10/going-out-on-top/" target="_blank">leaving Ohai</a>, <a title="Another former coworker of mine" href="http://virtualgunmen.douglasdesign.org/" target="_blank">Illucide</a> <a title="Nice linkage, Noel" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/39576-scott-hartsman-gallenite-free-agent-9.html#post1452542" target="_blank">referenced</a> an old post from <a title="Holy shit, could he put more references to himself in game?" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Alex_Afrasiabi" target="_blank">Furor</a> on his <a title="Maybe they should have set up shop in Carlsgood instead" href="http://www.fohguild.org/archive.php?page=32" target="_blank">visit to Sigil</a> when <a title="I don't think the Sigil name is even on this page" href="http://vanguard.station.sony.com/" target="_blank">Vanguard</a> was still in its very early stages.</p>
<p>tml;dc (too many links, didn&#8217;t click) &#8211; Furor pretty much posted that Vanguard was going to kick ass. I quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This game was fleshed out and built from the ground UP. These guys put so much work into getting the game built that it would be impossible to put everything in this update; and also illegal. Thousands and thousands of pages of gameplay design and documentation &#8211; I’m talking massive BOOKS, full of lore, maps, class descriptions, races, monsters, everything. You won’t see any MOONS popping up out of nowhere in this game. Expansions, additions, extensions, all thoughtfully planned out&#8230;. The folks at Sigil already have a quality product on their hands and I cannot wait until they release some information to the public so all of you can have the pleasure of getting a glimpse of what I got to see during my visit.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of those who tried Vanguard would suggest that the aforementioned quality was noticeably lacking in the final product. So what&#8217;s up? Was Furor lying, or at the very least stretching the truth so that he could stay in the good graces of some old friends?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. I think what happened on his visit was that Furor was presented with stories and visions, plans and ideas. And they sounded good. They had heart behind them. When coupled with some fancy artwork and a workable tech demo, Furor drank the Kool-Aid: he bought into the notion of <em>What Could Be</em>. Needless to say, he wasn&#8217;t alone&#8211;the Sigil forums were dominated for years by those who believed that Vanguard would be The One Game which would rule all others, and were willing to poke anyone who disagreed in the virtual eyeball.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy for fans to hear a passionate developer talk about ideas and begin to believe that they will be brought to life just as described. It can even happen to the very people working on a game! Developers can get so caught up in the game playing in their heads that they lose sight of the reality of the game that actually exists on their hard drives.</p>
<p>What is the ultimate root of this mass delusion? The simple fact that <strong>ideas are cheap</strong>. Even great ones.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a great idea for an MMO. So what? It means nothing unless you can pull it off. That means you must have both the skills necessary to implement it (writing, scripting, populating, coding, modeling, etc.) and the means to put it in game (stable, usable tools). If either your skills or your ability to implement falls short, your great idea will die a death of futility. The Graveyard of Ideas is full of great ones that simply couldn&#8217;t be pulled off.</p>
<p>Once again, it comes down to a simple truism: It&#8217;s all about execution. Do you have the skills to do it? Do you have the means to make it happen? And, if the answer to both those things is yes, do you possess the determination to polish your work to immaculate perfection as well as the strength of will to scrap it entirely if it doesn&#8217;t serve the fundamental pillars of your game?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to pick on poor Vanguard. Any number of failed games (MMOs and non-MMOs alike) could have been used to illustrate my point. Books, movies, music, TV shows&#8230; the same thing happens in every medium. Millions of dollars get thrown around every day on the strength of what someone believes to be a great idea. It&#8217;s not the idea that&#8217;s the gamble; it&#8217;s the ability for the investee to be able to execute it as well as they can talk about it.</p>
<p>By doing a bit of extrapolation, you begin to see why making a great MMO is so damn hard. You can make a successful console game if you execute one truly great idea extremely well. To make a great MMO, you need dozens of interconnected systems all based on great ideas executed extremely well, supported by thousands of iterations of quests, items, appearances, and locations executed to the highest degree of polish and care. All it takes is one major flaw to bring down all your great ideas like a house of cards. On top of that, if you have mediocre people implementing great ideas, those great ideas will end up looking mediocre.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like you can&#8217;t win! Maybe all of us in this business are gluttons for punishment. Or perhaps, for some of us, the possibility of pulling it off is too intoxicating to resist.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not (always) idiocy or incompetence that makes high-profile MMOs fail. It&#8217;s more that a whole bunch of interconnected things all need to go exceptionally right for one of  these games to come together. More often than not, it&#8217;s a few specific weaknesses in crucial areas that cause certain games to be considered a disappointment in the eyes of players.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very true that a lot of game developers enjoy shipping a title and then moving on to the next. In the console world this is how it&#8217;s done, of course; the MMO universe operates as a live service after launch, which is something even many seasoned developers are not used to or interested in. So having people move on is an expected part of the process.</p>
<p>The first year after EQ2 launched saw a number of its senior people leave, either for new opportunities within SOE or to other companies. But since the game remained SOE&#8217;s flagship product for some time, the team still had ample resources and plenty of good people on board. And as <a title="because he posts about *everything*" href="http://brokentoys.org/2009/07/10/scott-hartsman-leaves-scott-hartsman/" target="_blank">Lum mentions</a>, <a title="one of the best" href="http://www.hartsman.com/" target="_blank">my friend Scott</a> proved an invaluable presence who led the team to make many popular changes to the game. (Oh, what might have been if only so many of the game&#8217;s formative years of development hadn&#8217;t been squandered&#8230; but what&#8217;s done is done.)</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who&#8217;s done a fair bit of it, fixing other people&#8217;s broken shit is not always fun. I&#8217;m not referring to the kind of stuff where a design decision was made one way and you&#8217;d rather take it another; I mean coming across something horribly broken and convoluted<strong> </strong>that unfortunately crept into the game because at some point quantity was more of a priority than quality. But you do learn an awful lot from the experience, some of which is applicable to starting a new project from the ground up and some of which is not.</p>
<p>New projects are inherently sexy and fun. It&#8217;s a chance to make all new kinds of mistakes instead (you hope!) of repeating old ones. But by the same token, I agree with Eric that there is a lot to be said for working on a live game&#8211;especially if it&#8217;s one you love and want to see get better. But as he notes, a new generation of developers can sometimes be overwhelmed by good intentions and leap to make changes before fully understanding the implications. Hopefully the transition between the &#8220;A&#8221; squad and the &#8220;B&#8221; team is gradual enough that an osmosis of wisdom can occur and leave the new caretakers with everything they need to do the job well.</p>
