		<description><![CDATA[I do hope it eventually makes it to market daylight in a pleasing way. Assuming a purchaser didn&#039;t recruit back key talent .... wouldn&#039;t the game still be looking at a 3+ year cycle to learn, assimilate, and then finalize?


I agree the court stuff as it stands is pretty awful,  but to step back from 38 Studios .... one thing that this process illustrated, the US doesn&#039;t have enough protections for employees in this kind of situation.  If a company is withholding money from an employee&#039;s paycheck for benefits, and then not paying those benefit providers ... there really needs to be a legal notification to the employees when the first payment is missed.  (I&#039;m on the fence about criminal liability for the executives choosing not to pay those bills).   It&#039;s not just 38 where this has happened, Hostess had a similar issue where the management group wasn&#039;t making pension payments, but was deducting money from paychecks for it.   That&#039;s theft from where I&#039;m sitting, plain and simple.]]></description>
