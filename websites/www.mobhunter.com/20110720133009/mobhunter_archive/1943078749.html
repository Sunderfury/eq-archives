Check out the details:<p><B><I>Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures</I><br>All pets now think of mesmerized creatures as being dead. Pets will not break mez, will not attack mesmerized creatures, and will forget any hate they had towards a mesmerized creature.<p>In short, if a monster gets mesmerized, your pet will forget about it and stop attacking it. This is good for all pet classes, and especially handy for Enchanters, who can now trust their pets to not break every mez as soon as it lands.<p><I>Pets are neutral to monsters</I><br>Monsters will not attack your pet first. All monsters see your pet as a neutral creature, and will leave it alone unless your pet attacks something. This means if your pet wanders off, it won't bring a train of monsters back with it. <p>Keep in mind, if your pet chases a fleeing monster, other monsters may still attack it. Your pet is only treated as neutral while it is not acting in a hostile manner.<p><I>Pets no longer take experience in most situations</I><br>In the past, pets would take a full share of experience if they did the most damage to a creature. We've changed this rule as follows -<p>* Pets take ZERO experience from a creature, unless no player does damage to that creature. <p>* Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature - if no player does damage to that creature.<p>This means that your pet takes no experience from you or your group unless your pet kills a monster with no help from players. <I>As long as you or your groupmates do damage to a monster, your pet will take ZERO experience.</I><p>Due to the high potential power of dire charmed pets, they will continue to take a share of the experience. In the worst case, dire charmed pets will take a full share of experience - this is the same as it's always been. <p>The amount of experience taken by a dire charmed pet scales based on how much damage the pet does. If the dire charmed pet is doing the majority of the damage, it's experience share gets larger. If you or your group are doing reasonable damage to a monster, a dire charmed pet will not take much experience. The more damage you do, the less experience a dire charmed pet will take. In most situations, dire charmed pets will take less experience than they did previously.<p>As with all pets, if a dire charmed pet does the majority of damage, and no player does any damage, the dire charmed pet will take 75% of the experience from the kill.</B><p>Enchanters especially should be dancing in the isles, as well as anyone who groups with chanters very often--which is probably just about everyone. Although I'm sure the days of a necro telling an enchanter, &quot;Sorry my pet broke mez and got you killed. BTW, can you haste him plz?&quot; will be sorely missed. Oh, wait, all the necros retired. Insert the surviving pet class of your choice into the quote above, please.<p>The non-aggro wandering pet is a godsend, too. No more will you be grouped in Sebilis and say, &quot;Hey, didn't our mage have a pet around here somewh--HOLY @#$% TRAIN!!!&quot;<p>Waters didn't explicitly state when these pet changes would go live, which means they could go into effect as soon as Wednesday's patch. If not, considering the fluffing that pet classes got in Waters's message, the poor casters anxiously awaiting their balancing will surely rise up in revolt.<p><BIG>Speaking of the Patch...</BIG><p>Something that is virtually certain to be included in Wednesday morning's patch is the next batch of tradeskill changes that Yakatizma <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornersmithing.showMessage?topicID=5412.topic">posted</a> about on EQ Traders. The trivial level on many items has been lowered, in effect making them easier to create, impacting the progression that many would-be tradeskillers use to advance their skills.<p>As anyone who has undertaken a tradeskill in EQ knows, raising your ability level involves hours of tedious work in which you spend lots of money to make unwanted items that you sell back to vendors at a loss in hopes of seeing the coveted &quot;You have become better at...&quot; message. EQ Traders has numerous <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/learn.htm">guides</a> for advancing your skills, all of which will become obsolete with a new system of trivials.<p>The type of player that's sweating these changes most is the person who has tradeskills forced upon them for purposes of a quest. Seru and Shissar bane weapons both require high levels of smithing, and of course quests like the Coldain rings and shawls require the use of tradeskills, too. How the new trivial levels will affect these players remains to be seen.<p>Tradeskills are finally coming into their own, which is great to see. Players can now make and sell highly desirable items--the idols that port priests to their temples and the fierce heraldic armor for warriors are simply amazing--which is good for the economy and the game. The notion of requiring players to learn high-level tradeskills in order to complete quests is somewhat dubious, but then I guess you can always choose simply not to do the quest.<p>As for me, I think I'll take up cheese making. Sure, it may not have the glamor that it did a couple weeks ago, but I figure since I create so much cheese on this site that I might as well do it in game, too.<p><BIG>The Great Goblin Upgrade</BIG><p>Everlore <a href="http://www.everlore.com/#8">reports</a> that Bloodgill goblins in Lake of Ill Omen recently got a makeover. You can check out <a href="http://syndication.8m.net/gob1.jpg">some</a> <a href="http://syndication.8m.net/gob2.jpg">new</a> <a href="http://syndication.8m.net/gob3.jpg">pics</a> of the now blue gobbies  with their finny (finnish?) appearance.<p>Goblin representatives in Runnyeye and SolA are reportedly furious, demanding to know when their models will be upgraded. To which a Verant designer was overheard to respond, &quot;You guys have 50 hitpoints--you're not worth patching a whole zone for.&quot;<p>Thanks to one of our readers, Lerisanne of Saryrn, for pointing us to those pics.<p><BIG>The Most Terrifying Link, Ever</BIG><p>Normally I just sneak little humorous links into my articles and let you discover them for yourselves, but this one is so out of the ordinary that I felt it deserved its own heading.<p>I've been terrorizing my guildmates with this link for several days now, and many are reporting sleeplessness, night terrors, and a general loss of bowel control. Consider this a warning: Mobhunter cannot be held responsible for mental or physical defects caused by the viewing of this link.<p>There is some, uh, nakedness on this site, though it's not the type that's likely to get you fired at work for viewing it. More likely, your coworkers will either run away in fear and disgust or else be doubled over with laughter.<p>Without further ado, I'd like to introduce you to my new hobby: <a href="http://www.superdus.co.uk/portfolio/bodypainting2/spiderman.html">body painting</a>.<p>Don't say I didn't warn you.<br>
