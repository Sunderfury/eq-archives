He has since said that it was time for him to move on, work in a smaller company again, etc.<p>Now, it seems Brad will have a bit of company.<p>Mobhunter has learned through a reliable source (who wishes to remain anonymous) that Jeff Butler--EverQuest's producer--has announced his departure.<p>What is the immediate effect on the EQLive team? It seems Gordon Wrinn--a.k.a. Abashi--would likely be the man in charge.<p>Jeff's departure can't help but make us wonder whether his wife, Michelle Butler--one of Verant's customer service managers--will be going as well.<p>As to the reasons for Jeff's departure... well, we've learned our lesson about speculating. We'll let Mr. Butler make a statement when he's ready.<p>We wish Mr. Butler the best of luck.<p><BIG>*** UPDATED 9 PM CENTRAL 1/4/02 ***</big><p><I>Tann provided us with the following:</I><p>I managed to track down Brad McQuaid for a response about the Jeff Butler resignation that was reported.<p>I only had one real question for Mr McQuaid and he responded directly and honestly....<p>Tann : Mobhunter recently learned that Jeff Butler has resigned from EQ,  it seems rather strange to say the least the &quot;names&quot; of people leaving.  Any comments?  You know people are certain that you are stealing all of these people to create a new company.   <p>Brad : I'm not stealing anybody, but Jeff Butler did resign to join me in my new venture, yes.<br>
