Not only do you kill l33t mobs, you do so with a great sense of humor.<p>To give you a taste of <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/view_player.php?player_id=11">Tigole</a>'s wry wit:<p><i>Here it is folks, everything you ever wanted to know about the supposedly, end-all-be-all zone of the Scars of Velious expansion.  That's right I am going to spill the beans on Sleepers Tomb, the zone many will dream about but only a few will ever see. If you're not one for spoiler sites, I suggest you stop reading now. . .it could forever scar your Everquest experience.  I'm now going to walk you step by step through the amazing zone that is Sleeper's Tomb.<p>First off you must gather a worthy force.  I suggest a group around 127 or so.  We've cleared the zone with 126 once but it was living hell.</i><p>If you don't know why that's so damn funny, it's time to get the hell out of Crushbone and try a real raid. In any case, read the full story <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/index.shtml">here</a>.<p>Another interesting tidbit shows up farther down the page in the story about the Statue. We all know that the English language is in a constant state of evolution, but this might be pushing it a bit too far. Tigole has taken the incident that resulted in the guild <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-520063055">Conquest getting disbanded</a> and has made a new word. Apparently, &quot;Conquest-ed&quot; is now a synonym for being exploited.<p>I kind of like this new word, though I think it better to go with the simpler form of &quot;Conquested.&quot; The capital letter and the context of the word in the sentence should be enough to make the meaning clear.<p>Thanks for increasing our vocabulary, Tigole!
