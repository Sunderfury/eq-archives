It didn't take long for screams of &quot;WTF!?!?&quot; to be heard ringing throughout the dungeons of Norrath as frustrated players vented about being squashed by mobs that suddenly got hold of a bigger can of whoopass.<p><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=28634.topic">Thought Horror Overfiend</a> and <a href="http://pub138.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11921.topic">Grieg</a> seemed to cause particular distress, though just about any mob with an AoE spell had to be approached differently. Guilds that had begun to make headway into NToV, for instance, suddenly found themselves needing to beef up on the resist gear--a lot. Even upstarts like that punk third warder in Sleeper's Tomb were being crotchety.<p>Of course, not all mobs were made tougher. The biggest badass of all--the Emperor in Ssra Temple--turned into a <a href="http://pub138.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11917.topic">big creampuff</a> when he became slowable. Uberguilds reacted quickly to that one, you can be sure.<p>Overall, the new resist changes kinda suck. On the one hand, the system <I>is</I> working more like it probably should have been all along. It's just that you have to wonder whether such a sweeping change is a good idea at this point. Maybe we're all just too set in our ways. Or maybe we're lazy and we don't like swapping out resist gear. /em points at himself<p>Another issue that has crept up is the change to the experience curve. Some folks over on that naughty ShowEQ site were parsing the changes, and thought they discovered inequities in the system. Scott Hartsman--EQ's tech guru--decloaked and (gasp!) <a href="http://seq.sourceforge.net/showthread.php?s=82d67a10450768306232b5b2fb1984ef&amp;threadid=1878">posted</a> in their forums to state that the supposed results were flawed:<p><B>Parsing doesn't tell the whole story unless you know how those numbers are being generated. <p>...What you're seeing is the effect of the post-50 &quot;hell level&quot; rebalancing modifier. You're forgetting to take that modifier into account. We fixed this the same way we fixed levels 35-50. <p>...You really should have been using AA this entire time, which isn't subject to hell level modifiers, and you'd find the numbers are exactly the same as before any of the patches. <p>Or, you might want to try it with a level 59 character, in which case you'd see something to the effect of 20% *more* experience per kill. <p>If you're going to insist on snooping data, at least take some pride in your work and do it right. :) <p>I generally wouldn't bother with this, but snooping information, then interpreting it incorrectly, then using it to rile up others really doesn't help anyone.</B><p>A Verant higher-up posting on the SEQ boards is unusual, to say the least. But at any rate, the experience changes--especially after the recent fix--seem to be working okay.<p><BIG>Break out the Bug Spray</BIG><p>A <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5284">recent change</a> to the eqstr_en.txt file might signal the advent of something folks have been awaiting for a long time--raid experience. There are a whole bunch of new text strings for joining a raid, leaving a raid, etc. Hopefully shared raid experience will be on the way soon. My exp bar can use the help!<p>Is there anybody who doesn't think shared raid exp is a good idea? Okay, you wizards put your hands down. Anyone else? Didn't think so.<p><BIG>Slightly Less Epic</BIG><p>Absor's sole post as of late has been to <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=51603">address a change</a> to the druid epic. Was the removal of the snare component a mistake?<p><B>It was indeed intentional. Druids have been requesting that change for a while now. I apologize for missing it in the patch message, it certainly was something we should have mentioned.</B><p>Druids <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=28625.topic">generally approve</a> of the change, though they'd like something else added to compensate. Like a DT, or complete heal proc, or something equally simple.<p><BIG>De Planes! De Planes!</BIG><p>Yet another <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/prologue.jsp">prologue</a> has been added to the Planes of Power Web site, continuing the story that will lead to the opening of the upcoming expansion. This one features a naked female wood elf looking at herself in a pool of water.<p>Pool of water? If I was a naked female wood elf, I'd never leave the house!<p>Anyway, I can't tell any better than you can what the hell these obscure texts are supposed to mean. I'd say we have about a 50% chance of it all making sense by the time the last chapter rolls around. Some of us are still working on figuring out the whole Luclin story.<p>By the way, Verant also let us know that the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/beta_public.jsp">PoP beta has begun</a>, but you and I don't get to check it out. It's a closed beta. I guess I can stop sending roses to Rich Waters every day. /sigh<p><BIG>If the Straightjacket Fits...</BIG><p>Who is the most legitimately insane person in all of Norrath? Xarpolis. Why? <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=20492.topic">Check this out</a>.<p>I don't even want to <I>think</I> about how long that took. Somebody needs to get this guy some help. Fast.<p>That's almost as insane as those dirty Canadians <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=20494.topic">banning caffeine from Mountain Dew</a>. I mean, if there's ever been a reason to go to war with our neighbors to the north, THIS IS IT!<p>Besides, I think they have just enough French in their blood to make them surrender right away. At least until their Dew gets caffeinated, that is. Then they might start getting feisty.<p><BIG>Stars and Stripes for Norrath</BIG><p>One of my friends and guildmates on Xev, a mage named Nalaneni Feh'linth, is fond of making art with summoned items. To honor the significance of this day, Nala put together a couple of creations that I think are pretty darn neat.<p><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/images/nalaflag.jpg"><p><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/images/nalausa.jpg"><p>Thanks for the hard work, Nala!
