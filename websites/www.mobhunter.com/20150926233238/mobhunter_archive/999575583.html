Because Verant is being extra cautious about not screwing up the new database structures (or whatever it is they're doing), this week's patch is a little lacking. It also appears to be dated incorrectly:<p><B>April 23rd, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p>NOTE:  We are unable to patch &quot;code&quot; right now because we are in the middle of making some changes to the basic structure of the game.  This will delay fixes for system bugs and updates (such as Alternate Advancement Abilities and /commands).  Please be patient until we can get these much-needed changes finished.  Because these changes affect things such as the database that stores player characters, we're taking care to make these changes the right way.<p>** Items **<p>- Faun hooves are now stackable<br>- Storm Reaper Initiate Scimitar is now magic<br>- Moss Toe Bracer is no longer Lore<br>- Bracer of the Stoutdeacon is no longer Lore<br>- Infected Rat Livers are no longer No-Drop<br>- Shadowsong Cloak now also grants a hit point bonus<br>- Sambata Boulder now has a range value and can be thrown<br>- Spear of Foresight no longer has a range value (it is primary hand only)<br>- Rod of Identification now has 20 charges<br>- Patriarch Claws can now be used by Beastlords<br>- Crystalline Silk Threads are now stackable.<p>** Spells **<p>- Casters of slow spells recently given a disease component (such as Shiftless Deeds and Turgur's Insects) should no longer attract undue attention to themselves. <br>- Raised the price to purchase Phantom Plate scroll to be more in line with others of that spell line<br>- The following Spells are now usable by Beastlords: Serpent Sight(19), Enduring Breath(29), Levitate(39) and Talisman of Tnarg(53)<br>- Changed the way Circle of Summer stacks with other spells<br>- Changed Torrent of Fatigue so that it actually replenishes stamina for the caster instead of taking it away<br>- Cure Blindness should work now<br>- Changed Koadic's Heightened Focus to better stack with other mana regeneration spells <p>** Trade Skills **<p>- Cazic Thule tradeskill items are no longer No Drop  <p>** Quests **<p>- Halfling Toes should now be available<br>- The Dark Elven Cleric Guild Summons should show the proper text now<br>- The Dark Elf Wizard Guild Summons should show the proper text now<br>- Unholy Silk Bracer recipe should be correct now</B><p>Mmmm.... infected rat livers. /drool<p>Lots of trade skill items got updated, as well as some spell and uberloot effects. Things like the CH bug fix will still have to wait. [insert extra witty comments here to satisfy the &quot;we need witty banter&quot; crowd]<p>Our good friend Remelio Gemweaver also provided us with a list of changes to the spdat file--you know, that spell thing. Follow this <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=604683359">link</a> to view them. Thanks again, Remelio!<p><BIG>Mo' Downtime</BIG><p>The server maintenance schedule was also <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000551.html">updated</a>:<p><B>On Sunday, April 28th, at 7PM PDT, (3AM Monday morning GMT), the Antonius Bayle server will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. The estimated downtime is 8 hours.<p>On Monday, April 29th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), the Rallos Zek and Rathe servers will be brought down for scheduled maintenance. The estimated downtime is 8 hours for the Rathe and 11 hours for Rallos Zek.</B><p>I guess it takes longer to patch a Zek server. Those l337 PvP tactics must make the <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/pga/gallery/20020421/1019436850lpga_longs_drugs_rcp107.html">hardware</a> tougher to manage or something. Do you think the Zek server boxes try to PK the bluebie server boxes when the network admins aren't looking?<p><BIG>A Table Before Me in the Presence of Mine Enemies</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000550.html">recapped</a> some of what happened at the Seattle FanFaire, and came up with this observation:<p><B>You know, that's an interesting idea... maybe we could host a panel with the fan sites, let them field questions about what it's like to run a site. As you might have noticed, our table space is often limited. But it sure wasn't hard to find most of those guys, just head to the loudest party.</B><p>Loudest party? Mobhunter wasn't there, Alan. You have no *idea* about loud.<p>It would be kinda fun to have a fan site panel like that. I can just hear the introductions now...<p><I>And on my left, we have Allakhazam. [applause] Next, from Casters Realm, we have Baelish. [applause] From Mobhunter, meet Moorgard. [crickets chirp]</I><p>Okay, so maybe it wouldn't be so fun. It would be interesting to see if anyone had the stones to call me a VAK to my face, though.
