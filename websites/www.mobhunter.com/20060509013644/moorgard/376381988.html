<html><head><title>The Stall</title></head><body><h1>The Stall</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-07-07</p>As noted previously, the politics of <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=292602756">urinal usage</a> are elaborate indeed. But they pale in comparison to the even more subtle complexities of behavior related to that other prominent public restroom fixture: the stall.<p>Female readers will no doubt have their own opinions on the stall, and will likely come to somewhat differing viewpoints on the proper etiquette for the situations we shall examine today. While owing somewhat to the distinction in attitudes and practices between men and women, the disparity in customs can more properly be attributed to the fact that women spend all their public restroom time (aside from washing and preening, of course) within the stall. This familiarity, coupled with the more sensitive nature of female washroom habits, breeds a very different restroom culture. As I have spent little appreciable time inside public women's lavatories, my examination will be confined to practices inside the typical corporate American men's room.<p>To most males, the stall is the ultimate bastion of freedom within the office environment. It is the one place the average man can be assured of absolute privacy and peace. Behind the locked door of the stall--and in any restroom outside of perhaps some twisted throwback junior high bathroom, the stall must indeed have a lockable door--corporate man can bask in precious solitude.<p>Yet no matter how posh the restroom in question might be, certain situations can arise which threaten the sanctity of the stall. It is these dilemmas we shall scrutinize, in an effort both to cope with the ordeals that arise and hopefully prevent them from occurring in the future.<p>Stalls are generally one of two types: regular or handicapped-accessible. It is to the laws designed to protect the rights of the disabled that restroom inhabitants owe a great debt, for in general parlance the handicapped stall is often known as &quot;first class.&quot; This is due to the stall's larger size and generally better lighting, giving an open, airy feeling of freedom not often present in the more cramped quarters of normal stalls. Given the choice, I know few men who prefer regular seating to that of first class.<p>Since men's rooms are equipped with urinals for the ease of liquid waste removal, one might assume that stalls are solely devoted to the excretion of fecal matter. In reality, however, it is inevitable that some men will use the stall--either by force or by choice--for the urinary process. It is not uncommon for all urinals to be occupied at a given time. During such situations, a gentleman may elect to use the stall rather than wait for an available urinal (though some, including myself, would propose that if one of the men at said urinals is in the act of either tapping or flushing, one should stand at a discreet distance behind the man and wait for him to move on). Additionally, one might suffer feelings of stage fright (please see previous article) and thus choose the stall as a means to avoid potential embarrassment.<p>In such situations, stall use for urination is acceptable. However, some minimum standards of politeness must be maintained. Lifting the seat on the toilet before urinating is an absolute requirement. While males were gifted with generally good control over their excretory streams, direction is never an absolute. Stray hairs or fibers can misdirect the flow and cause unintended spraying, leaving the toilet seat a speckled shambles. Additionally, splash-back is a common concern when relieving oneself into the toilet bowl--in fact, this is why properly domesticated husbands have usually been trained by agitated spouses to sit down when urinating in their home bathrooms. There is scarcely anything more disturbing than entering a stall for some quality personal time only to find the toilet seat decorated by yellow droplets left behind by the inconsiderate haste of a previous inhabitant.<p>It is chiefly for this reason (as well as stray rectal hairs that might collect upon the toilet) that I choose to line the seat of whatever stall I enter with a protective layer of toilet paper. While some men are fine with lowering their trousers and plopping their hindquarters thoughtlessly upon the stool, I dislike the notion of some of my most private and delicate skin touching the same area as that of a potentially unwashed stranger. Proper papering also serves as some measure of protection against the disconcerting &quot;warm seat&quot; phenomenon that occurs when the stall has been recently occupied by another user.<p>As most men's rooms do not come equipped with a seat-cover dispenser--and because said covers usually don't fit the seat in question anyway--I find it best to use a five-piece pattern of tissue to protect the seat. This includes one long piece down the length of each side, one diagonal on each curve at the back, and one piece crossing the latter two at the top. This coverage pattern protects exposed skin almost completely from anything save a lingering wet spot; additional pieces of tissue can be employed to remove those. If a complete seat covering is not practical due to the urgency of the situation, one can usually get by with a quick but thorough wiping of the seat before sitting. It is only in the most dire of emergencies that a gentleman will perch atop an unwiped, unprotected throne.<p>(As an aside, the practice of covering the seat with toilet tissue achieves another benefit: you ensure that there is enough paper present to fulfil its more traditional role. There are few experiences in the universe more disconcerting than finishing a messy bit of business only to find the toilet tissue dispenser lacking. The best one can hope for in such a situation is a completely empty bathroom so as to make a quick dash into the next stall for paper, or, failing that, to have a compassionate fellow in the adjoining stall who can pass you a sympathy ration. Failing either case, the distasteful alternatives--magazines, newspapers, junk mail, low denominations of currency--are too unpalatable to discuss further.)<p>Another requirement for preserving the sanctity of the stall is the no-talking policy. If two men who know each other enter stalls simultaneously, there should be no conversation while either is inside. Not only does such dialogue violate the principle of the stall as a refuge of solitude, but it potentially ruins the concentration of another individual who might require focus to achieve his desired excretory result.<p>While I had hoped the following tangent would never need to be expressed at the professional restroom level, unfortunately it must be stated clearly and with conviction: <I>Do not enter a stall while talking on your cellular phone, and do not answer your phone while in the stall.</i> Amazingly, some uncouth individuals do not grasp the simplicity of this common-sense edict. There is no matter in the universe pressing enough to require its discussion while engaged in the act of defecation. Would you speak to your mother at such a moment? Your spouse? Your child? Then have the courtesy not to subject even the most casual of callers to such an indignity. That, gentlemen, is what voicemail is for.<p>Among the courtesies one should extend to other patrons of the stall is discretion during unavoidable audible outbursts. A common part of the waste-removal process is a release of bodily gases, which can range from near silence to being quite loud in nature. When one is inside the restroom and the inhabitant of a stall lets loose a billowing explosion of flatulence, it behooves those involved to avoid juvenile laughter or other childish reactions. After all, next time you find yourself in need of a public stall, you may well be the one on the receiving end of an unwelcome thrust of laughter.<p>Similarly, when one inhales the inevitable aroma of a stall inhabitant's fecal deposit, the civilized man will refrain from making vocal comments as to the unpleasant nature of the scent. Such odors are part and parcel of stall usage, and any user of a public restroom must be prepared for that eventuality. Conversely, as there is usually no form of air freshener present in a men's room, it falls upon the deliverer of such unpleasantries to initiate a &quot;courtesy flush&quot; even if the excretory process is not yet complete. This polite gesture makes life somewhat easier upon the current and future inhabitants of the restroom, and creates a fresher atmosphere for the initiator of the reek. A rule of thumb in this situation is that your bowel movement smells about twice as bad to others as it does to you, so bear this in mind when debating whether or not a courtesy flush is appropriate.<p>Finally, there is yet another common-sense principle that I must nonetheless make absolutely clear: <I>Always, always, always wash your hands before leaving the bathroom.</i> Not only is this practice polite and well-mannered, but it helps avoid the spread of fecal matter and the associated bacteria that accompanies it. Regardless of how carefully one cleans any soiled areas down below, there is always the chance that, while wiping one's nether regions, your hand might brush accidentally against a stray glob of scat. Without proper washing, said material may be transferred to any number of surfaces, including the hands of those you might find yourself greeting. (It is for this reason that I loathe shaking hands with anyone I don't know quite well, but that is perhaps a topic for another time.)<p>Hopefully this exploration of excretory rituals has proven valuable to you, and will inform your usage of public restrooms in the future. Combined with urinal etiquette, these principles should enhance your appreciation of men's rooms and the functions you perform within them.<br>
