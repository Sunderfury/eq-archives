You know... 989 Studios... EverQuest cost $9.89 per month to play... it was a neat little &quot;in&quot; joke. Well, as a crooner from Manchester once sang, &quot;That joke isn't funny anymore.&quot; <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000526.html">Absor says</a>:<p><B>Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, we will be increasing our subscription rates in April. Effective April 25, the new monthly subscription rate will be $12.95/month. <p>We will continue to offer discounts from the new rate plan on multi-month subscriptions. The new price for a 3-month subscription will be $35.85 and a 6-month subscription will now be $65.70. <p>You don't have to do a thing; you will automatically be migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription plan when your current subscription plan expires.<p>HOWEVER, for a limited time only (from April 10 through April 24, 2002), you may extend your current subscription for an additional 12 or 24 months by signing up for the new EQ 12 or 24 month plan - and reap great savings off of the new rates:<p>* Extend for 12 months for $109 US - and get a 30% discount off of the new monthly rates!<p>* Extend for 24 months for $190 US - and get a 39% discount off of the new monthly rates!<p>Now is the time to lock in these rates, so don't miss out.<p>For more information visit <a href="http://www.everquest.com/rates">www.everquest.com/rates</a></B><p>Well, I guess we should have seen this coming. Did we really expect to stay at under $10 per month forever? Everything goes up in price, right? I mean, movies don't cost what they did three years ago, houses don't cost the same, etc. So, rationally, we should just roll with it.<p>On the other hand, $3.06 more a month times 420,000 subscribers--okay, for the sake of argument, let's subtract the supposed 8,000 Stormhammer people and say 412,000--that's a lot of green.  In the neighborhood of $1.25 million per month, depending on the type of plan people choose.<p>Have costs really gone up that much? I mean, the cost of hardware has gone down... the cost of bandwidth probably hasn't changed much... what has gone up, exactly? Salaries? Rent? Inflation has been virtually nonexistent sine 1999, so that can't be a big factor.<p>It has to come down to personnel. Which begs the question: what will my $3.06 buy me? Will we have a bigger customer service staff now? On the &quot;ghetto&quot; servers, I mean--Legends is supposed to pay for itself.<p>Look, I don't mind a &quot;cost of doing business&quot; increase every once in a while. Raising the monthly fee a buck or two is pretty reasonable. And hell, $3 plus change a month isn't going to affect my bottom line one bit, nor anyone else's in the EQ gaming universe.<p>But there is a principle here. That $3.06 must represent something close to a doubling of the current profit model of EverQuest. Why now, when we just paid for an expansion in December and are set to pay for another six months from now, do they need this extra cash?<p>I'm not going to whine about this, and it's ridiculous to threaten to quit a game we get so many hours of enjoyment from over a mere $3. But I do think more of an explanation than &quot;the increased costs of running the EverQuest game&quot; should be given, and I do think we should expect some enhanced service based on the size of the increase.<p>Maybe owning the hearts and minds of a half million players isn't enough for Sony. Maybe they want EverQuest to not only be a success, but a powerhouse moneymaker as well. Hauling in an extra <B>$15 million dollars per year</B> would certainly help accomplish that.<p>EverQuest is still a great deal, even at $12.95 a month. But being able to raise a twink to level 10 in the blink of an eye isn't worth $3 more a month from me--I need something a little more tangible. And I'll be watching to see if I get it.
