Included are lots of tatooed troll variants (some living, some dead) and other minions who serve the clan.<p>If you look closely, you'll find a picture of me in disguise as I was infiltrating the troll stronghold (the handwraps give me away). You'll also see a photo of the future Mrs. Moorgard, looking hot and trashy in a strappy blue number. ROWRRRRR!<p>Um, anyway, most of the new mobs are of course variants of existing models, which is fine. After putting a ton of work into new models for PoP, we didn't really expect to see a ton of new creatures in the five zones of this extension thingy.<p>Hey, quit staring at the future Mrs. Moorgard! She's all mine, you drooling punks!<p><TABLE><TR><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/HumFPirate03.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/HumFPirate03s.jpg" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><I>Mrs. Moorgard swings her sword.</I></TD></TR><TR><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/LuggaldRobe05.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/LuggaldRobe05s.jpg" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><I>Robe dude runs around.</I></TD></TR><TR><TD><A HREF="http://www.linkdead.com/TrollBoss03.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/TrollBoss03s.jpg" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><I>A troll that just might not get the crap beaten out of him by a froglok.

The extension should have been called &quot;The EverQuest Utility Pack--Plus a Few New Zones,&quot; because that's a much more accurate indication of what you'll be getting for your money.<p>Last week the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_cartography.jsp">cartography system</a> was unveiled for LoY, and it looks fairly impressive. Lots of tools are included for making your own maps, and thanks to keeping track of the z-axis, you'll actually be able to navigate multi-layer dungeons without looking at a cluttered mess.<p>Lazy people like me will be glad to know that the map data should be exchangeable between players, so you won't have to map the whole world yourself. Supposedly one of the former ShowEQ people worked on this feature, making the file format very similar to that illicit program's mapping functions.<p>Will this fancy new gizmo replace my beloved books of maps printed out from <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/">EQ Atlas</a> and other sources? No way, sparky. While the cartography thing will be handy, it won't give you the level of detail that Muse and others have spent so long accumulating.<p>The page showing new LoY mobs should be released later today, so watch this space for an update.<p><BIG>Big Lizard in My Backyard</BIG><p>Just in case you didn't notice the latest patcher graphic, you might want to take a gander. It shows one of our fine froggy friends riding a rather bulky lizard.<p>According to our gal Lucy, looks like this reptilian pony is called a <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=3813&amp;source=Test">drogmor</a>. No word yet on whether Mr. Ed will be froglok-only or if all races will have a chance to ride the new beast.<p>Yet another model added to the heretofore jam-packed global file, I guess. Some of us would rather see that space used for new armor graphics, while others would prefer a wider variety of pets, but I guess SOE wants to save room for things that make money, such as cute lil' froggies and big lumpy dewbacks--er, drogmors. Let's just hope EQ2 has a lot more space for global models and textures, because the limited looks available to the Luclin models have long since worn thin.<p><BIG>My Name Is MUD</BIG><p>Tired of bitching about all the problems in EverQuest? Think you can do better? Well, here's your chance. We were sent the following press release:<p><B>The MUD-Dev Mailing List Presents the<br>First Annual MUD-Dev Conference<p>Saturday, March 8th, 2003,<br>09:45 AM - 6:00 PM, San Jose<p><a href="http://www.kanga.nu/MDC/">http://www.kanga.nu/MDC/</a><p>MUD-Dev presents the MUD-Dev Conference, a daylong conference about MUD game design, development and implementation and related topics.... <p>The MUD-Dev Conference will be a real-time, face-to-face complement to MUD Dev, a well-known email list that covers MUD game design and development and is distributed to a large and growing number of game developers in multiplayer online games. It will provide a tight feedback loop between presenters and audience for discussing MUD development, and will include peer review, presentations, technology and system demonstrations. The MUD-Dev Conference will continue to build and widen the MUD-Dev community by providing the informal discussion, socializing and networking that we have all been asking for.</B><p>So all you have to do is spend the day at this conference and you can build an online world of your very own. Just be sure to let me beta test it for you so I can tell you how much you suck.<p><BIG>Moooooooooney</BIG><p>A <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2003/02/11/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm">recent article</a> at CNN Money talks about EverQuest Online Adventures and SOE's moneymaking machine in general. I know, I know, like we need more articles talking about how successful EQ has become.<p>Of note, however, is the little-publicized fact that SOE has cancelled Sovereign after working on it for many many years. You know, for as many times as I've seen that game mentioned, I couldn't tell you one thing about it. And maybe that was part of the problem.<p>Anyway, reports are that EQOA is pretty decent. The <a href="http://everquestonlineadventures.station.sony.com/">official Web site</a> gives a good rundown of the game and provides access to the discussion forums. The downside is that a lot of the <a href="http://everquestonlineadventures.station.sony.com/races.jsp">character models</a> are a bit, shall we say, less than detailed, but I guess they had to make sure that lag would be bearable on large-scale encounters.<p>Csenicier actually has a PS2 with the online connection junk, so if we can lay our hands on a copy of the game we will give it a spin and see how we like it.<p><BIG>Bane There, Done That</BIG><p>Of all the &quot;EQ killers&quot; that have been in the works for ages, there is one that keeps getting brought up as offering something Verant never gave its customers: PvP that works. Well, you might just get your chance to check out this long-heralded game (assuming you weren't already in the very large beta) at the end of March, as that's when <a href="http://shadowbane.ubi.com/">Shadowbane</a> is due. No, seriously. That's when it's supposed to be out, they say. This time around.<p>After all the damage DAoC was supposed to do to EverQuest and didn't, I'm skeptical that Shadowbane--whenever it comes out--will have much of an impact. Yes, it will be a better game than DAoC and will almost certainly have more content than Asheron's Call 2 does, but I just don't know that any game with a PvP focus will have the widespread acceptance that EQ has attained.<p>Sure, you can see that plenty of people love fighting against other players in real time--the success of Quake 3 and similar games proves that. But I have a theory that this kind of conflict doesn't appeal as much to fans of the fantasy game genre. See, part of the reason we play EQ is that we want to be heroes. We want to slay the big bad, save the maiden, and be admired by others. It's hard to feel valiant when some 14-year-old kid just nuked you and laughs &quot;d00d I /ownz0red u!&quot; as he stands mockingly over your corpse.<p>I don't think the Zek servers have low populations just because PvP isn't implemented well in EQ; I think it just isn't a big draw to the kind of people who play this game. I'm sure Shadowbane will amass an audience, and hopefully there's enough other content to keep players interested. But unless there's a hook for all types of players, I just don't see how the game will appeal in the long term to anything more than a niche of an already niche market.<p>Of course, I could be wrong. But really, that happens so seldom...
