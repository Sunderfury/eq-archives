Perfect!</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-07-31</p><BIG>Patch of the Day</BIG><p>The severs went down in the wee hours of the morning in a hastily announced patch--at an earlier-than-usual time to boot. Here's the patch message:<p><B>July 30, 2002  12:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>We apologize for updating the servers on such short notice.  As a bonus, /hitsmode functionality is now available in the new UI.  Please check out the context (right-click) menus from New UI Chat windows.  Hopefully this version is somewhat easier to understand. :)<p>** General Enhancements and Tweaks **<p>- NPC and PC names display settings should be saved between sessions.<br>- Bazaar Search Window is now resizable.<br>- Disabled Begging and Stealing in the Bazaar<br>- The New UI Train window no longer cuts off any skill names for INT casters.</B><p>Along with the typical updates to eqgame.exe and spell data, this update included some new versions of files in the uifiles default folder. As I was watching them download, it occurred to me that an awful lot of people are using custom UI files now, and thus the window changes &amp; fixes wouldn't take effect, because custom UIs use a different directory that you make yourself.<p>Since none of the files downloaded were windows that I had modified, I just copied the new files into my custom UI directory. You will want to do this, too. The files involved are:<p>window_pieces02.tga<br>gemicons02.tga<br>EQUI_TrainWindow.xml<br>EQUI_TextEntryWnd.xml<br>EQUI_SkillsWindow.xml<br>EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml<br>EQUI_Animations.xml<br>EQUI.xml<p><I>Edit: I ran the patcher almost right after the server went down and the above files were downloaded. A bit later additional files were added, which include:</I><p>SIDL.xml<br>EQUI_SocialEditWnd.xml<br>EQUI_SelectorWnd.xml<br>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml<br>EQUI_BazaarWnd.xml<br>EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml<p>You can just use Windows Explorer to sort by the most recently modified files in the default directory and copy those to your custom folder.<p>If you don't stick the updated files into your custom UI folder, you will probably crash when you try to use the /Bazaar search function. A poster over on the Fires of Heaven board <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2169">discusses the issue</a>:<p><B>the /bazaar crashing bug is caused by the animations.xml file and the bazaar search window (verant added a new image so ANY mod that uses an older animations.xml will crash with /bazaar) <p>im pretty sure this bug affects the vertical buff box mod for one. <p>the new image is called A_SqrButton (the stupidass background behind the ItemName/Price/Seller list), or something similar <p>just thought all of the people who are crashing should know about it <p>Quartz UI 1.2 (with bazaar patch+others) is released @ <a href="http://www.eqskins.com/">EQSkins.com</a> or the <a href="http://skins.machin-shin.net/">quartz UI</a> site</B><p>The Quartz UI is really slick. It's the very fancy one with curved lines and vastly reorganized windows, but it makes me woozy to look at it.<p>Anyway, if you crash when using the Bazaar, check for an updated version of whatever UI you are using, or copy over the new files yourself. Clearly there needs to be a better way to update the xml files for people who are using custom UIs, because making users manually copy files each time they're patched is bound to create problems.<p><BIG>Tomb Be or Not Tomb Be</BIG><p>You no doubt read the coverage of the Sleeper's Tomb revamp over on Legends. But since we're devout Kerafyrm groupies here at Mobhunter, we wondered whether or not the non-premium servers will be getting this content as well. So we asked Rod Humble, Executive Producer of an awful lot of products that have &quot;EverQuest&quot; in the title, what the scoop was:<p><B>Yup, the Sleeper's revamp will hit regular servers. Not sure about the timeline, but probably about the same length as Jaggedpine [was exclusive to Stormhammer]. By which time we should have something new for Legends.</B><p>We also asked him whether revamps to zones like Veeshan's Peak, Nurga, and Droga were really happening or if those are just rumors. Rod didn't want to give specifics, but he did say this:<p><B>Actually, the team is pretty jazzed about doing revamps so I wouldnt rule out any zone. As a perma-lowbie casual gamer I have really enjoyed the newbie zone changes in the past months in particular, which seem to have helped our many recent new newbies (is &quot;new newbies&quot; proper English?) progress a lot faster than used to be the case.</B><p>I'd consider that good news. While early zone revamp efforts such as Paw and Runnyeye produced mixed results, the redesigned Temple of Cazic Thule was really well done, and the new stuff added to the newbie zones that Rod mentioned seems to be well received. It's a bit early to judge how the ST revamp is working out, but the changes show a lot of promise.<p><BIG>Check Your Bags at the Door</BIG><p>While the new UI is tremendously great, a few bugs have been creeping up now and again. Of particular note is one brought up by those ever-prancing bards--a rather serious one, as it involves <a href="http://pub105.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=14582.topic">losing items</a>. While no clear pattern is visible, bards do seem to be hit particularly hard, perhaps because of all the item switching they do.<p>Others are reporting item loss <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=30167.topic">on corpses</a>, and I've known of at least one guildmate of mine that this has happened to. There was no mention in today's patch message about the problem, so it's too early to tell whether or not it has been fixed.<p>Please, if you die, be 100% sure that all your items are recovered from your corpse. We'd even recommend taking a quick run through your inventory when you log in, just to be safe. If you find anything is missing, petition immediately, because the servers do keep records of what items you have.<p><BIG>We've Got Spirit, Yes We Do</BIG><p>Absor <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=19124.topic">dropped in</a> over at Graffe's wizard board to let the frail casters know that Verant is aware of faction issues involving their epic quest and that the matter is being looked into. It seems doing the epic is ruining the Truespirit faction of those involved, which comes back to bite them in the buttocks when trying to help with the shaman epic and so forth.<p>Alan was concerned that swarms of pasty wizards would be assailing him about this issue at the upcoming FanFaire in Boston. Well, who can blame him? Wizards might weigh only 98 pounds each, but getting enough of them in one place would make anyone nervous. You never know what's hidden in those robes.
