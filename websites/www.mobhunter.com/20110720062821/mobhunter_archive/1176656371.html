I've pleaded in big bold letters for Verant to listen to me, but I've never really said why I think this is so important.<p>Clearly, player advancement is <B>the</B> chief method of keeping people hooked on EverQuest. Yes, talking with friends and cybering the local leather-clad druid are fun, but ultimately it's the thrill of improving our little avatars that drives us to keep playing. Player advancement comes in several flavors: gaining levels, obtaining new equipment, adding new spells, and (with Luclin) learning new abilities.<p>Of these, gaining levels is the most straightforward. There is a maximum level in this game, and you want to reach it. (By the way, I don't for a second believe the people who claim not to have any desire to be level 60; those who do so have other reasons that they simply don't want to face--but that's another editorial.) If you were level 50 when Kunark was released, you know firsthand the frenzy as players sprinted to reach level 60, and all the resulting pressure from not wanting to be a second-class player by lagging behind your friends.<p>So yes, there is a psychological factor in not wanting the level cap raised. If it is, then powergamers will race to reach the new cap, no matter how hard it is to attain, while more casual players will feel like they've been left in the dust. Well, you might say, the current alternate advancement system introduces a similar disparity--some players have more than 100 points while others have only a handful. Doesn't this also provoke resentment and discontent?<p>To an extent, yes, but there's a major difference. The AAXP system, which offers players significant ways to upgrade their characters, nonetheless has the feeling of being optional. That is, not getting a ton of AAXP points isn't going to make you a lesser character--you just won't have every possible skill. And that's okay... it's livable.<p>Like it or not, levels are <B>mandatory.</B> You <B>must</B> level if you want to enjoy high-end content. Why? Because due to the way EverQuest was coded, <B>levels make the most significant impact on a character's performance.</B> More than stats, more than armor or weapons, more than spells, more than resist gear. Levels. Period.<p>Your level affects all kinds of things, from aggro radius to base hit points to your ability to resist spells. Facing a level 50+ mob, a level 50 player in the best resist/AC gear is going to take more spell/melee damage than a level 60 player in far inferior equipment. That's just a fact of the way the game was made. There is a reason guilds post minimum level requirements in their recruiting rules, and it isn't to be exclusive or elite; quite simply, level 60 players are the most effective.<p>There is a huge number of level 60 players right now. If the cap was raised to 65 or 70, every one of them--<I>every one of them</I>--would feel absolutely compelled to level, because they would know with complete certainty that reaching the new cap would be a requirement for effectively facing the high-end mobs introduced in the Planes of Power. For one of the uberest guilds in the game--Afterlife, Fires of Heaven, Legacy of Steel, etc.--this isn't really an issue. Their members, virtually to a person, devote so much time to the game that needing to gain another five or ten levels would be trivial, and would end up providing them tangible benefits. Thus, raising the level cap does help the &quot;evil powergamer&quot; stereotype that people bat around.<p>But there is a very steep dropoff after that. My guild, for instance, is the second most powerful guild on my server, yet we have a large number of members who could be defined as &quot;casual gamers.&quot; These are people who, despite being level 60 and having AAXP skills, don't necessarily play every single night and don't devote every second of our free time to gaining more exp. The thought of raising the level cap has caused no small number of players in my guild to state that they would flat-out quit if the level cap was raised. Why?<p>Because levels rule all. Levels are mandatory. And rather than face a mad rush to gain five or ten levels or, alternately, to feel like they were letting the guild down by not obtaining them, they'd rather just quit the game. EverQuest is supposed to be about fun, not about pressure. Yes, a certain amount of pressure is needed in life, but too much is too much. A higher level cap = pressure. Lots of it.<p>Psychological impact aside, there is an obvious downfall to raising the level cap again: the trivialization of existing content. What happened to Vox, Nagafen, SolB, Lower Guk, Fear, and Hate when Kunark came out? They became jokes. Check out <a href="http://bcope1.www6.50megs.com/monk/guides/solb.html">this guide</a> to SolB that was written back in the day (there used to be separate versions for the fire giants and efreeti run, but I don't know what became of them). Before Kunark, the Stone Spider room represented risk, even for a full group of level 50s. Now I run out of spawns soloing it when I get bored enough to go there. A few 60s can do the fire giants or efreeti with almost no risk, and of course Nagafen and Vox became so trivial that Verant had to invent a new gimmick to prevent them from being farmed.<p>To their credit, the folks at Verant seem to understand the potential balance problems, and don't intend to risk making NToV the next zone where you hear shouts of &quot;camp check&quot; and find individual groups camping each dragon spawn point, along with some level 70 monk soloing flurry drakes. And yet, Verant is already promising &quot;Further character progression making players even more powerful&quot; in PoP. They have to do something, and seem to be leaning towards a system that would make any levels or extra abilities be planar only. That is, you might be level 70 in the Plane of Disease, but in the old world, Kunark, Velious, or Luclin you would function as a level 60. That solves the problem of trivializing content, but still leaves open the psychological downfalls of raising the level cap. And I still don't like it.<p>I'd be much more in favor of another skill tree being added to the game: Planar Skills. This could simply be another button on your AAXP menu, and you could devote whatever experience you gain into your exp bar, your AAXP bar, or your Planar bar. To avoid making existing content too easy, these abilities would only function in the Planes of Power. What kinds of skills should be included? Hey, I can't solve all of Verant's problems. (Well, maybe I <I>could,</I> but...)<p>Or how about items that have powerful effects--similar to focus items, or maybe HP/regen items for melee--that require you to have a certain number of Planar Skill points to activate? Like maybe some nice bracer that gives 7 HP/tick of stackable regen if you have 10 PSXP points, but only acts like a regular bracer without them. If Verant is feeling ambitious, they could do some fancy coding. Say you have 20 total PSXP points. You put on a regen bracer that requires 10 points to use, so now you have 10 left over in your pool. You put on some boots that let you run at SoW speed which require 7 PSXP points, so now you have 3 left over. This means you can't wear those cool new gloves that add +10% to dodge because they require 8 PSXP points to activate. Better get more points!<p>Basically, I'm in favor of just about any system that keeps advancement optional. The Planes of Power expansion is clearly designed for high-level players, but it shouldn't be exclusive to the uberest of the uberguilds. Yes, you should reap more rewards if you put more time and effort into the game, but you shouldn't be made to feel like you're a second-class citizen just because you can't keep up with the demands of a video game.<p>I don't envy the task Verant has ahead of them. Balancing content alone is tricky enough, and throwing either new levels or a new skill system into the mix makes things downright dangerous. They blew it with Kunark and threw the game completely out of balance, and it's only now that the mess is finally getting cleaned up. To Verant's credit, the AAXP system was one of the highlights of Luclin, which gives me hope that they can pull it off again with the Planes of Power. My fingers are crossed.<p>Just please, don't raise the level cap. Please.
