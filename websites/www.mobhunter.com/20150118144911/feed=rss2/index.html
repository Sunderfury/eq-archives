			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=816" target="_blank">last year&#8217;s post</a>, I admitted that I was finally buying more music digitally than on CD. Unsurprisingly, that trend has only escalated in 2014. I bought digital music exclusively except in three cases: 1) it&#8217;s an artist I have a particular fondness for, and I consider their music to be an artifact I wish to own, 2) the CD was cheaper than the digital files, or 3) there was an in-store exclusive version with bonus tracks I desired. That last one is particularly powerful, and Target has proven particularly skilled at grabbing exclusives with a wide variety of artists.</p>
<p>I spent less and less time in record stores, as Amazon has become my shopping destination of choice. What&#8217;s more, their Prime Music library is utterly amazing, and well worth the price of Prime in and of itself. While browsing through pages of thumbnails lacks the tactile pleasure of flipping through music bins, I find the thrill of coming across a great old record and adding to my library nearly as satisfying. And it&#8217;s not just ancient stuff; they have many releases from 2014 that you can grab and enjoy, including several mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado, my list of favorites from another great year of music:<span id="more-835"></span><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Like It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interpol &#8211; <em>El Pintor</em> </strong>- Sometimes a band needs to be away for a while to remind you how much you miss them. Interpol has always lived in the house that Joy Division built, but at their best they have a potency and optimism that belies their darker influences. <em>El Pintor</em> wasn&#8217;t a departure from the band&#8217;s established sound, but that felt to me like a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Adams &#8211; <em>Ryan Adams</em></strong> &#8211; When he released <em>Gold</em> in 2001 and <em></em>Rock N Roll two years later, Adams was poised to become one of the most distinctive songwriters of his generation. I remember reading an interview in which he talked about the high volume of songs he wrote, and how he could release album after album of new material. I thought that sounded like magic. Well, it turned out that while he kept the promise of regularly releasing albums, he rarely managed to reach the heights of those earlier milestones. Still, I buy every record Adams puts out, because I know he&#8217;s capable of greatness. Happily, this year&#8217;s self-titled record harkens back to those classics, and I think it&#8217;s his best effort in a decade. If not quite <em>Gold</em>, it&#8217;s still a valuable addition to his legacy.</p>
<p><strong>Angel Olsen -<em> Burn Your Fire for No Witness</em></strong> &#8211; Olsen&#8217;s record is the darling of many critics&#8217; lists this year, and for good reason. It harnesses the fire of early PJ Harvey while offering more depth. Snarling at times, but the songs have a warmth to them as well. Often stark and harrowing, yet Olsen never drives the listener away.</p>
<p><strong>Chromeo -<em> White Women</em></strong> &#8211; If money was no object and you wanted to book a band to play a high-concept disco party, you&#8217;d hire Daft Punk. But if you wanted to stage a fun, sexy disco soiree, then your money would be better spent on Chromeo. This duo is unabashedly a playful throwback to an earlier age, and in so doing may wind up closer to the spirit of what disco was about in the first place. A great party record, especially if you want to watch your guests get freaky.</p>
<p><strong>Dum Dum Girls &#8211; <em>Too True</em></strong> &#8211; Jangly guitars over female vocals and a bouncy beat describe most of the songs on <em>Too True, </em>a solid turn from this Sub Pop band. At times singer Dee Dee Penny&#8217;s vocals recall Chrissie Hynde or Shirley Manson of Garbage, with a confident, cocky snarl befitting a rock star. Many of the songs project a real sense of fun, making this a really enjoyable album.</p>
<p><strong>Death From Above 1979 &#8211; <em>The Physical World</em></strong> &#8211; After a prolonged absence since their last release, DFA came back with guns blazing this year. Their music is a blend of rock and blues and dance that reminds me of Urge Overkill&#8217;s brief heyday. A band that&#8217;s not afraid to cut loose, but they keep your feet firmly on the dance floor. A welcome return.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Henry &#8211; <em>Invisible Hour</em></strong> &#8211; Every Joe Henry record feels like an artifact, crafted with the same care with which Ken Burns makes a documentary. While Henry usually stays true to form&#8211;quiet songs about flawed characters who might have fallen straight out of a John Steinbeck novel&#8211;there are always so many nuances to his music that it benefits from repeated listening. <em>Invisible Hour</em> is another work of art well worth your scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>Jack White &#8211; <em>Lazaretto</em></strong> &#8211; It always felt to me like the White Stripes were a little overrated, and I&#8217;ve often rolled my eyes at Jack White&#8217;s many Twitter feuds. But there finally came a point where I could no longer deny that the man knows how to make a kick-ass record. <em>Lazaretto</em> is dark and mesmerizing, and just a lot of fun. Maybe I need to go back and give his earlier work another shot.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Messersmith &#8211; <em>Heart Murmurs</em></strong> &#8211; This Minnesota songwriter consistently sells out local venues but deserves a much wider audience. His last several releases have been rock solid, evoking the best of smart, catchy pop music with honesty and depth. A collection of love songs, <em>Heart Murmurs</em> plays with expectations to weave tales of many different types of love. It&#8217;s cleverness that never feels anything less than genuine.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Love It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>St. Vincent &#8211; <em>St. Vincent</em></strong> &#8211; Although I was not overly fond of 2012&#8242;s collaboration with David Byrne, I think the pairing re-energized St. Vincent&#8217;s Annie Clark. Her new record is bombastic and bold, as evidenced by her enigmatic performances on Letterman and SNL. Always offbeat, the latest collection embraces that distinctiveness with a driving set of songs. This record challenges the listener and rewards the effort.</p>
<p><strong>My Brightest Diamond &#8211; <em>This Is My Hand</em></strong> &#8211; Yet another female artist who operates under a <em>nom de plume</em>, MBD&#8217;s Shara Worden is a musical chameleon who can effortlessly shift from chamber to dance music with any number of genres in between. She similarly slinks between emotions in her lyrics, from playful to poignant. Every number is a candidate for a contemporary piece on So You Think You Can Dance&#8211;which, in my book, is high praise.</p>
<p><strong>Hospitality &#8211; <em>Trouble</em></strong> &#8211; Pretty much any band fronted by a smoky-voiced female singer is going to merit a listen from me, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ll fall in love with it. At first, I thought Hospitality might end up in a pile of mediocre releases, but something about <em>Trouble</em> stuck with me. It was probably the Wire-like drone of &#8220;Last Words&#8221; that hooked me, but soon the other songs lured me in. I&#8217;ve returned to this album again and again over the course of the year, and enjoy it more with each visit. Give it a chance and you&#8217;ll mine unexpected depth.</p>
<p><strong>alt-J &#8211; <em>This is All Yours</em></strong> &#8211; This band&#8217;s sound is really hard to pin down. Ranging from electronic to prog to world music, the vocals are often as mercurial as the melodies. But sprinkled in among the many influences are songs that weave their way into your subconscious. Heady stuff, but with a personality that simultaneously welcomes and challenges the listener without being off-putting.</p>
<p><strong>FKA twigs &#8211; <em>LP1</em></strong> &#8211; At turns alluring and unsettling, FKA twigs (ne Tahliah Barnett) defies labels and genres. Sometimes when an artist creates music so resistant to categorization, it comes across as forced. Here, it almost feels like a challenge, as if Barnett is daring you to try to put her in a box. There are hints of classic soul paired with ominous whispers that recall Tricky at his best. Certainly a compelling artist I can&#8217;t wait to see develop further.</p>
<p><strong>Damien Rice &#8211; <em>My Favourite Faded Fantasy</em></strong> &#8211; A songwriter standing onstage and singing his or her heart out is certainly nothing new. But Rice does it like a surgeon, his music stripped to the bare minimum and his lyrics wielded like a scalpel&#8211;deft and precise yet mercilessly sharp. In the eight years since his last album, he&#8217;s lost none of his edge, and cuts most deeply into his own psyche. Every Damien Rice record has moments that stun me with their perceptiveness and vulnerability, so personal that the listener can&#8217;t help but gaze into the mirror as well.</p>
<p><strong>Black Keys &#8211; <em>Turn Blue</em></strong> &#8211; The ever-reliable Black Keys (along with ace producer Danger Mouse) could have simply turned out another collection of radio-ready singles in the vein of their previous mega-seller <em>El Camino</em>. Instead, they released a more brooding, personal record that addresses the challenges and demons which often accompany fame and success. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; there are still hits aplenty, such as the throbbing &#8220;Fever,&#8221; but <em>Turn Blue</em> is not defined by them so much as by introspection.</p>
<p><strong>Warpaint &#8211; <em>Warpaint</em></strong> &#8211; With songs trippy, slow, and sexy, Warpaint weaves an alluring spell. Fans of the xx will find a lot to like here, with spare beats and echoing vocals that pull the listener in. Though this LA ensemble has been around for about seven years, it&#8217;s now that they&#8217;ve found their footing. Thoroughly modern, though at times I hear a (very welcome) hint of the Cocteau Twins or Lush.</p>
<p><strong>TV on the Radio &#8211; <em>Seeds</em></strong> &#8211; While I&#8217;ve found all of TV on the Radio&#8217;s albums enjoyable, &#8220;joy&#8221; is the word that immediately springs to the forefront when listening to <em>Seeds</em>. The songs abound with catchy hooks, and an infectious fervor runs through the record. This is rock at its most spirited and fun, but crafted with satisfying skill.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Gotta Have It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Afghan Whigs &#8211; <em>Do the Beast</em></strong> &#8211; Often when a band is on hiatus for a decade and a half, they come back either diminished or transformed into a new incarnation that is all but unrecognizable. Such is the fear when an act as beloved as Afghan Whigs rises again. Happily, <em>Do the Beast</em> is in every way a worthy successor to previous epics like <em>Gentlemen</em>. From aggro teeth grinders like &#8220;Metamoros&#8221; to slow burners like &#8220;Algiers,&#8221; the Whigs are capable of conveying a startling range of aural sensations. Welcome back, fellas. Stick around a long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>Lana Del Rey &#8211; <em>Ultraviolence</em></strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s possible that Lana Del Rey&#8217;s carefully crafted persona is talked about more than her music. And in fact, that persona is part of the appeal. In my mind, Del Rey is a construct, a theater piece, as much of a disguise as the members of KISS in their makeup. Her lyrics are high-concept costumes, her songs scenes of a play. Whereas <em>Born to Die</em> told the story of a young ingenue discovering that sex can be used as a tool or a weapon, <em>Ultraviolence</em> portrays a more seasoned, cynical character who has achieved success and stands at the height of her powers. Gone are the hip-hop trappings of her previous effort, replaced by rock-tinged torch songs. I hope Lana Del Rey delivers a compelling third act, closing her character&#8217;s story as an aging beauty who reflects on her failings as well as her triumphs. Time will tell how this story plays out, but I&#8217;ll be watching from the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard Cohen &#8211; <em>Popular Problems</em></strong> &#8211; Considering the countless words written about Leonard Cohen in the many decades of his storied career, it&#8217;s unlikely that I&#8217;ll come up with anything original to offer here. All I will say is that, of all his contemporaries, Cohen&#8217;s work feels the most unashamedly human. Our triumphs and our flaws are all on unflinching display. <em>Popular Problems</em> teems with sex and blues and doubt, like all of Cohen&#8217;s best work. Released on his 80th birthday, it feels wizened and reborn all at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Elbow &#8211; <em>The Take Off and Landing of Everything</em></strong> &#8211; Elbow is another group that is hard to classify, bringing Peter Gabriel-esque eclecticism into a modern context. But the songs are the true stars here, with lyrics both introspective and candidly observant. &#8220;I live and die by the hot and cold in strangers&#8217; eyes&#8221; croons singer Guy Garvey, an apt perspective on the life of any artist. The band has been together for 20 years, and the cohesion is evident, yet somehow the music feels fresher than ever. I&#8217;ve played this record countless times over the year, and its depth is always satisfying and astonishing.</p>
<p><strong>First Aid Kit &#8211; <em>Stay Gold</em></strong> &#8211; It may seem improbable for two sisters from Sweden to craft such perfect country-tinged pop songs, but that&#8217;s exactly what has happened on <em>Stay Gold</em>. In fact, I&#8217;m not certain there is anyone else on the planet, in any genre, making harmonies this beautiful. Each sister&#8217;s voice is lovely on its own, but together they are almost hypnotic, startling in their power and warmth. As if that weren&#8217;t enough, their songwriting has improved with each album; their previous effort, <em>The Lion&#8217;s Roar</em>, was replete with memorable gems, but their latest disc is exceptional from start to finish. When I listen to this record, my mind is instantly transported to a vast golden plain where the notes soar like the wind. Utter perfection. My record of the year.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also terrified, because I&#8217;ll be on stage in front of several thousand people to talk during a small portion of the keynote speech. I love doing panels, but standing in the spotlight of the big stage is another thing altogether. It&#8217;s early in the morning on Friday, so with any luck I&#8217;ll be too tired to be nervous. Sadly, though, Vegas and luck don&#8217;t usually go hand in hand for me.</p>
<p>These shows are a ton of work, but seeing the reaction of the fans makes it all worth it. I know that sounds cliche, but it&#8217;s actually true. So come say hi if you&#8217;re there, I&#8217;d love to chat!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A look back at my time on Vanguard, and my feelings now that the game has gone dark.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 6pm PST on July 31, 2014, the servers for Vanguard: Saga of Heroes went dark. I wasn&#8217;t on the team that originated the game at Sigil, but I served as its Creative Director for a number of months upon my return to SOE in 2012.</p>
<p>It was a series of unlikely events that led to me working on Vanguard. I&#8217;d just spent the last five-and-a-half years on Copernicus, which was built on fresh tech and the best art assets an MMO had ever seen. After four months on the job hunt, I&#8217;d accepted a design job at a studio focused on console and mobile titles when I got the call inviting me back to SOE.  Though I was looking forward to trying my hand with other types of games, MMOs are my first love, and the idea of reuniting with old friends in San Diego was a big draw. I knew my ultimate destination would be the EQNext team, but I was asked to first help with an attempt to revitalize Vanguard. After weighing my options, I returned to San Diego determined to do my best for a game with one of the most storied histories in the genre.</p>
<p>Working on Vanguard was never easy. It was an aged title by the time I got to it, and although faster PCs allowed it to run better than it had back at its 2007 release, it was still plagued by technical problems resulting from architectural decisions made early on. Its content was a mess, ranging wildly in quality from inventive to abysmal. There were significant bugs everywhere, many of them years old. And while the design tools put a lot of flexibility into developers&#8217; hands, its many idiosyncrasies intersected with a database awash in the detritus of years of half-finished work. Every bug we fixed seemed to come with an unintended side-effect. Change the name of an item and some unrelated field would get zeroed out. Adjust one stat and other variables would be altered without telling you. Lack of version control meant you had to hunt through screen shots or ask players what an item used to be like before it got unintentionally nerfed. There were a lot of days when I would literally sit with my head in my hands, flummoxed at how some feature or another could possibly have been implemented in such a convoluted way.</p>
<p>And yet, I grew to love the game.<span id="more-822"></span></p>
<p>This was due almost entirely to the small but passionate group of players who managed to look beyond the mess and find the beauty in Vanguard. I don&#8217;t mean how the game looked, although Vanguard did have some of the loveliest vistas you could find in an MMO thanks to its sprawling open world (environments generally looked better from a distance than they did close up). No, these players found beauty in the challenge and adversity that had quickly whittled Vanguard&#8217;s audience down from respectable box sales to a small crew of diehards.</p>
<p>These hardy souls stuck with the game through long periods of neglect when literally no new content appeared. Sure, they had their moments of bitterness, and rightfully so, but their bond with one another outweighed the negatives. They did their best to recruit new players to the game, but poor performance and lingering bugs meant not a lot of those visitors stuck around.</p>
<p>The free-to-play renaissance gave Vanguard a chance. A team was built up and the game was dusted off. Work was done under the hood to support the FTP model, and attention was paid to the starting experience in order to make new players coming in a bit more welcome. Veterans became hopeful&#8211;or at least cautiously optimistic. I came on board after the game went free and some content updates had already rolled out. We had a tech director who knew his stuff, a veteran producer, a talented art director, and a team of people who wanted to see Vanguard succeed. Many of them had been there during the Sigil days and had long wanted to give the game the chance it deserved.</p>
<p>For a time, our chances looked good. Being on Steam brought us attention and some new faces. The in-game store had periods of decent sales. We had a promising trajectory to build upon.</p>
<p>Sadly, it didn&#8217;t last.</p>
<p>In the years that Vanguard languished, the MMO landscape had kept moving. When Vanguard was released, there were still only a handful of active MMOs on the market, but it didn&#8217;t take long before new massively multiplayer titles were crawling out of the woodwork. Players had more and more choices all the time, many of them taking the genre in different directions (or at least featuring significantly higher production values) while Vanguard stood still. It was hard to attract players when there were so many newer, shinier alternatives.</p>
<p>Ultimately there were just too many gaping holes to patch. A major revamp of the network code came too late to help build an audience. And with the state the game was in, adding polished content was simply too costly and time-consuming given the size of our audience. The team shrank as most of us were shifted to other games, and I joined the team making EQNext and Landmark.</p>
<p>While sunsetting a game is inevitably going to cause hurt feelings among players, the truth is that SOE gave the game a lot of chances. Most other companies would have pulled the plug after the initial downturn in subscriptions. Instead, the game was kept alive for over seven years, and fans who wanted a challenging open world MMO had a place to call home for an awfully long time.</p>
<p>By any objective benchmark, Vanguard was never a great game. But the love we have for MMOs isn&#8217;t about benchmarks&#8211;it&#8217;s about heart. And the game&#8217;s promise, its potential, took hold in the hearts of a core group of fans. They loved the experience despite its flaws, and found those moments of beauty to cling to. In the end, Vanguard was about community and camaraderie, about pride in overcoming adversity together. And it&#8217;s that kind of abiding passion that makes me so proud and excited to work on MMOs, because no other type of game has quite the same potential.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to say I logged in for the game&#8217;s final hour. I helped summon people to an unreleased zone to show them a bit of what might have  been and got the chance to say farewell to many friends. It was bittersweet, to be sure, but I choose to remember the sweet.</p>
<p>Rest well, Vanguard. You&#8217;ve earned your place among the stars.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back when I worked in record stores, my boss Daryl used to tell me that as long as there was something among Tuesday&#8217;s new releases that he could fall in love with, he knew he hadn&#8217;t overstayed his time on the job. I can&#8217;t say that I find a new record to love every week, but I think there&#8217;s enough new stuff to like each year that I still enjoy creating this list of favorites.</p>
<p>This is the first year I bought more music digitally than I did on CD. This is mostly due to having moved away from the East Coast and the excellent Newbury Comics chain, my weekly haven for both music and comics. Even though I live pretty close to the wonderful Lou&#8217;s Records in Encinitas, life is busy enough that I don&#8217;t make it there too often. The other factor is that I&#8217;ve really embraced Amazon&#8217;s Cloud Player, which makes it ridiculously easy to access my music across devices.</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado, here&#8217;s my favorites for what&#8217;s proven to be an excellent year of music.<span id="more-816"></span></p>
<p><strong>&gt; &gt; Like It &lt; &lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Civil Wars &#8211; <em>The Civil Wars</em></strong> &#8211; Their last album, <em>Barton Hollow</em>, was my favorite of 2011. Though their sound is as pristine and precise as ever, why don&#8217;t I regard this album more highly? Perhaps the public turmoil that all but broke up the band weighed down the chemistry and charm the duo once shared. Whatever the case, this album strikes all the right notes and boasts a handful of standout songs, but its heart doesn&#8217;t quite hold up.</p>
<p><strong>Lorde &#8211; <em>Pure Heroine</em></strong> &#8211; To be honest, I don&#8217;t know how to feel about Lorde. As a teen pop singer dominating the charts, I wonder if her dark, brooding image is genuine or carefully crafted. Maybe it&#8217;s both. In any case, what I can&#8217;t deny is that I like the minimal arrangements of these songs as much as the formidable hooks themselves. If she doesn&#8217;t fall into self-parody, Lorde just might become a musical force that&#8217;s going to be around a while. And hey, there&#8217;s certainly been a lot of far worse stuff on the charts lately.</p>
<p><strong>Goldfrapp &#8211; <em>Tales of Us</em></strong> &#8211; This collection of torch songs with a pulsing beat is more mellow than some of her previous work, but it makes an excellent album to just chill out and enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Shelly In Athens &#8211; <em>At Home</em></strong> &#8211; This was a good year for female-led dark synth groups, and Keep Shelly falls into that satisfying middle ground between the manic turbulence of Crystal Castles and the driving pop of Chvrches. Brooding and sexy, with a bit of an edge.</p>
<p><strong>Nine Inch Nails &#8211; <em>Hesitation Marks</em></strong> -Returning from a (sort of) lengthy hiatus during which he was anything but dormant, Trent Reznor released the Nine Inch Nails album you pretty much expected him to make. The songs are solid, the lyrics are personal, and the music stays current and relatively safe. Good, but not as great as I&#8217;d hoped it would be.</p>
<p><strong>Phoenix &#8211; <em>Bankrupt!</em></strong> &#8211; The French group Phoenix delivered yet another album of satisfying power-pop that gets your feet tapping and head bobbing.</p>
<p><strong>Placebo &#8211; <em>Loud Like Love</em></strong> &#8211; These stalwarts of androgynous alterna-glam are still getting it done. Worth it for the sexy swagger of &#8220;Rob the Bank&#8221; alone.</p>
<p><strong>Small Black &#8211; <em>Limits of Desire</em></strong> &#8211; Unabashedly harkening back to the New Romantic era of 80s synth-pop, these grooves are poppy and accessible enough to sound both familiar and fresh. The standout track here is &#8220;Breathless,&#8221; though there are others worth the money as well.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Jones &#8211; <em>Spirit in the Room</em></strong> &#8211; A mix of gospel songs and covers of the likes of Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen, the amazing Mr. Jones still possesses a voice most young pop stars should envy. &#8220;Bad As Me&#8221; is the perfect song to sum up an amazing career.</p>
<p><strong>Toro Y Moi &#8211; <em>Anything in Return</em></strong> &#8211; Though there&#8217;s a lot of funky goodness to groove along to in this catchy set, at times it feels a bit all-over-the-place. There&#8217;s a hint of Steely Dan in some of these tracks, and I consider that a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Atoms for Peace &#8211; <em>Amok</em></strong> &#8211; Another Radiohead side project, this disc sees Thom Yorke&#8217;s familiar lilting vocals paired with Flea&#8217;s insistent bass lines. Very good, but at some point the sonic similarity of these songs starts to work against them just a bit.</p>
<p><strong>The Olms -<em> The Olms</em></strong> &#8211; Though most of Pete Yorn&#8217;s solo work doesn&#8217;t move my needle, there&#8217;s something about the 60s feel of this collaboration with J.D. King that I find particularly appealing. Catchy pop with a hint of gloom about the edges.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &gt; Love It &lt; &lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Janelle Monae &#8211; <em>The Electric Lady</em></strong> &#8211; The funky and gorgeous Ms. Monae delivers yet another futuristic concept album disguised as catchy R&amp;B that even the most reluctant booty can&#8217;t refuse. Though perhaps just a half-step off the grandeur of <em>The Arch-Android</em>, this record&#8217;s eclectic mix of styles brings a genuine smile to my face. Despite some pretty formidable guest stars, Monae shines front and center. Also, it&#8217;s about robots and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Daft Punk &#8211; <em>Random Access Memories</em></strong> &#8211; You couldn&#8217;t go anywhere in the first half of the year without hearing about Daft Punk and their rather ingenious media campaign (before Miley started stealing all the attention by just being naked). While I wouldn&#8217;t say <em>Random Access Memories</em> is revolutionary, it takes the four-on-the-floor disco beat and hones it to pop perfection. Endearing guest turns from the likes of Giorgio Moroder and the amazing Paul Williams just reinforce how much there is here to love.</p>
<p><strong>Sting &#8211; <em>The Last Ship</em></strong> &#8211; The music of the Police helped me survive high school, and Sting&#8217;s first several solo albums remain favorites. But for the past decade, Sting has released a series of live and eclectic (almost novelty) albums far from the pop sensibilities that made him famous. So when I heard he was releasing an album of songs written for a Broadway musical, I nearly shrugged it off. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. <em>The Last Ship</em> is Sting&#8217;s most genuine album since <em>The Sou</em>l Cages, a record it shares a lot of thematic ground with. In these tales drawing on Sting&#8217;s youth in the Newcastle shipyards, we meet characters who feel honest and real, centered on relatable tales of love and family. These are good songs that feel genuine, a welcome return to form that hopefully Sting can carry forward into future material.</p>
<p><strong>Bosnian Rainbows &#8211; <em>Bosnian Rainbows</em></strong> &#8211; Fans saddened by the hiatus of The Mars Volta may take solace in the rise of Bosnian Rainbows, whose debut album is at turns catchy, driving, and challenging. They feed off the energy and bite of early Blondie, Berlin, and even Missing Persons without falling into pop schmaltz.</p>
<p><strong>Caitlin Rose &#8211; <em>The Stand-In</em></strong> &#8211; I challenge you to listen to this record without picturing yourself downing whiskey in a forlorn honky-tonk. Rose has that classic country croon that is both mesmerizing and heartbreaking, with a smoky sexiness that drives its way directly into your ear holes. Down one for me.</p>
<p><strong>David Bowie &#8211; <em>The Next Day</em></strong> &#8211; Though he was never truly gone, the return of David Bowie was one of the most welcome surprises of 2013. His absence might have been timed just exactly right to remind us all how crafty and brilliant a songwriter Bowie remains. Echoes of his glam days are knowingly mixed with both self- and world-awareness that bring an air of honesty that few artists today have the credibility to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Daughter &#8211; <em>If You Leave</em></strong> &#8211; Mix spare guitars, haunting synth washes, and dusky female vocals and you&#8217;ll pretty much guarantee me to listen. But the songs of Daughter transcend the parts, culminating in a mesmerizing mix that reminds me of early Cat Power records. Also well worth purchasing are the <em>His Young Heart</em> and <em>The Wild Youth</em> EPs.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds &#8211; <em>Push the Sky Away</em></strong> &#8211; Nick Cave long ago traded his thunderous wailing for a more quiet, subtle kind of menace&#8211;well, mostly&#8211;but he still sounds like a preacher spinning ominous cautionary tales from a shadowy pulpit. His recent records contrast those dark tales with a fragile beauty, proving how deft a touch the Bad Seeds retain after all these years together. The closing title track brings this record to a satisfying conclusion that leaves me hungry for more, and with an artist of Cave&#8217;s longevity, that&#8217;s saying something.</p>
<p><strong>Jail Weddings &#8211; <em>Meltdown: A Declaration of Unpopular Emotion</em></strong> &#8211; If you take the aforementioned fury of Nick Cave and wrap it up in some 50s doo-wop and rockabilly as filtered through the Cramps, you have an idea of what Jail Weddings is all about. &#8220;Why Is It So Hard to Be Good?&#8221; is a standout track that captures the essence of this excellent band, as shifting tempos build to a danceable beat that makes you want to howl with reckless abandon. It all feels slightly naughty, which is part of what makes it so damn good.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &gt; Gotta Have It &lt; &lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elvis Costello and the Roots &#8211; <em>Wise Up Ghost</em></strong> &#8211; An artist with as many varied collaborations as Costello has had might come across as needy or desperate, but albums co-penned with the likes of Burt Bacharach and Allen Toussaint portray a genuine love for music in all its forms and styles. <em>Wise Up Ghost</em> is no exception; what might have looked like an aging pop star hitching his wagon to a younger, hipper train instead feels like a genuine partnership of musical equals&#8211;even contemporaries. This has as much to do with the Roots as Costello, for ?uestlove and crew share the same broad tastes and appreciation for musical history as their collaborator. The result is a set of catchy, intelligent songs with tight production and virtuoso musicianship. This one&#8217;s not to be missed.</p>
<p><strong>Savages &#8211; <em>Silence Yourself</em></strong> &#8211; I had assumed, upon hearing <em>Silence Yourself</em> for the first time, that Savages must be made up of veterans of various punk, pop, and hardcore bands. You&#8217;ll have to forgive me for being mistaken; this band of newbies attacked with such blistering force, burning from the first bar, that it only made sense that they&#8217;d been around the scene forever. While you&#8217;ll hear echoes of Siouxsie and Wire and other bands both retro and modern, the sharpness and fury is all the band&#8217;s own. I love how this record at first feels like a bristling challenge, but soon starts to feel familiar&#8211;like you&#8217;ve earned your way to listen to it. I&#8217;ve played the hell out of this album and always find something satisfying about it.</p>
<p><strong>Arcade Fire &#8211; <em>Reflektor</em></strong> &#8211; While by no means the band&#8217;s sophomore effort, <em>Reflektor</em> does bear some of the trappings of second-album syndrome. After the critical and commercial success of <em>The Suburbs</em>, how was the band going to move forward? Would they produce something lackluster like the Killer&#8217;s second album? Or would they spiral into self-indulgence a la U2&#8242;s Zooropa? Personally I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve done either, though they seem to willingly and delightfully dance on the precipice of the latter. Songs like the title track ground themselves in disco beats, while dub (the reggae kind, not dubstep) weaves its way through several songs as well. Yet the indie rock pillar of the band remains strong, and the songs themselves never get lost even when the trappings skirt the edge of excess. At the end of the day, this is a great record of powerful songs worthy of Arcade Fire&#8217;s name.</p>
<p><strong>Chvrches &#8211; <em>The Bones of What You Believe</em></strong> &#8211; The thing I find so compelling about this album is the layers. On the surface, Chvrches offers danceable electronic catchiness that is instantly likeable and could easily occupy a spot atop the pop charts. But the more you listen, the more a depth and vulnerability cuts through, pulling you in and wrapping you up in nuances often absent from others of this ilk. There is power and urgency here, both in the washes of sound and in Lauren Mayberry&#8217;s vocals. Since its release, <em>The Bones of What You Believe </em>has gone from a record I would throw on for a lark to an album I seek out and dive headlong into. That&#8217;s why&#8211;even in the face of stiff competition from veteran favorites&#8211;it&#8217;s my record of the year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were layoffs today at SOE. I was not among them, but it was a shitty day anyway. It&#8217;s something that happens way too often in our industry. My personal scars are still fresh, and the events of today have made old wounds ache once more.</p>
<p>Some of the layoffs hit very close to home&#8211;many folks had been fixtures at SOE a long time, and were doing great work. I don&#8217;t know the logic behind who was let go and who wasn&#8217;t&#8211;that&#8217;s the kind of thing companies don&#8217;t go into detail on. It is what it is.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m very glad to still have a job, I can&#8217;t help but feel a bit of survivor&#8217;s guilt. Why them and not me? I try not to dwell on it, because doing so accomplishes nothing. Better to spend that mental energy trying to help those folks make connections and find a safe place to land. Assuming there&#8217;s any safe place, I mean.</p>
<p>I remain in the games industry, even through the heartbreak of days like today, because it&#8217;s immensely fulfilling on a creative level and I feel that my best work on MMOs is still ahead of me. Yet events like this make me wish my destiny was more in my own hands and less at the mercy of others.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Later this week I&#8217;ll be participating in <a title="Sorry, it's sold out" href="https://www.soe.com/soelive/" target="_blank">SOE Live 2013</a> (the event once known as Fan Faire) in lovely Las Vegas. It&#8217;s at Planet Hollywood this year, so it will be interesting to be in a new venue.</p>
<p>This will be the biggest SOE fan gathering in a number of years, no doubt in large part because of the big reveal of EverQuest Next. I&#8217;ve been on the EQN team for a number of months now, contributing to narrative and game design. There&#8217;s a lot of really cool and different things happening, so I&#8217;m excited to see the public&#8217;s reaction.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be participating on two panels: the World of EQN, which is Friday at 5pm, and the Lore of EQN panel on Saturday at 2pm. Be sure to say hello if you&#8217;re attending. Even after the reveal I won&#8217;t be able to answer every question, but we&#8217;ll finally be out of the black box at least.</p>
<p>Buying me drinks won&#8217;t get me to say anything I shouldn&#8217;t&#8230;but you&#8217;re welcome to try!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are various dates one can identify with the death of 38 Studios. You could cite the day the company failed to pay its employees. You could choose the date the company declared bankruptcy. For me, 38 Studios was about the team and the friendships we shared, so I mark May 24 as the point it ended&#8211;the day we were officially laid off and walked out of our office together for the last time.</p>
<p>As one of my former colleagues recently noted, in some ways it feels like barely any time has passed; in other ways, it feels like a hundred years. There remains a surreal quality to the whole thing, a disbelief that it ever really happened. Yet there are reminders of it everywhere in my life, reminders that leave a sense of unfinished business.</p>
<p>The studio and its most recognizable faces still turn up in the news regularly. Most recently, the lawsuit against Curt and others involved in the bond deal has made headlines, along with an article saying that the IP and assets are finally going up for sale. The former is a farce grounded in political posturing, an attempt to shift blame away from politicians who want to be reelected. I&#8217;m confident the truth will come to light.</p>
<p>The latter is more personal. My blood and dreams flow through Amalur; the lack of closure has left me unsettled. The prospect of someone finally buying the work that my friends and I put so much of ourselves into leaves me with mixed feelings. Copernicus will never see the light of day, at least not in the form we intended it to take. Some buyer with an engine and a suitable back-end could take the considerable assets we created and plug them into their game, instantly owning some of the best looking characters, environments, and animations on the market. While much of the focus in the press has been on the MMO, another possibility often overlooked would be to take the work the BHG team had done on pre-production for Reckoning 2 and release a sequel. The first game was well-reviewed and it continues to attract players, so there&#8217;s definitely money to be made if a company could do it right. But with the key members of both teams spread across the globe, the chances of pulling off a successful product are slim at best. After all, it&#8217;s the teams who truly make their games shine&#8211;not assets on a hard drive.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I&#8217;d love to see something finally come about from all the work we did. But if the result is some stranger butchering our material and slapping the Amalur logo on shoddy work, I&#8217;d rather the assets just fade away into the mists of time. I can only hope that if someone does buy it, they treat it with the respect it deserves and realize they&#8217;ve acquired something pretty special. We&#8217;ll soon find out.</p>
<p>Today I read that it takes half the duration of a relationship to finally get over it. If that&#8217;s true, I&#8217;ve got at least a couple more years before I can truly move on. But that&#8217;s okay; despite the challenges and pain I&#8217;ve felt since it ended, the memories and friendships forged at 38 continue to enrich my life, and have given me countless lessons to draw upon in my career going foward.</p>
<p>It was all worth it&#8230; every beautiful, heartbreaking minute.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After playing some Guild Wars 2 for a while, I finally decided to fire up Mists of Pandaria and see what WoW has been up to. Although I had a higher-level death knight, I decided to yank my good-old level 70 arms warrior from retirement (the undead fellow who still decorates the banner of this site) and see how I fared.</p>
<p>Checking out Pandaria on this guy, of course, required that I play through Lich King and Cataclysm as well. This dampened my enthusiasm, as I&#8217;d already played through a lot of that stuff on my death knight, and I hate repeating content. So I opted for dungeon finder, and found myself having a ball. As the ultimate non-commitment tool, dungeon finder allowed me to sail through XP and gear acquisition without having to repeat the Lich King quests I&#8217;d previously completed. And if I screwed up, it was no big deal&#8211;it wasn&#8217;t like I&#8217;d ever see any of the people I was grouped with again. The Wrath dungeons are a lot of fun, so I enjoyed myself quite a bit, and my warrior was 80 in no time.</p>
<p>Playing through Cataclysm was less fun. The XP curve from 80 to 85 was slower, and I found the dungeons in this expansion far less enjoyable. It&#8217;s not that they were more difficult really; it&#8217;s that the same tricks seemed to be used over and over, as I was endlessly looking for burning spots on the ground to avoid. To pad my XP gains, I ended up playing through the whole underwater zone as well, which I found abysmal (pun intended). I mean, it was fine and all, but the design of the quests felt a little uninspired. The one exception was the naga city where you enter a vision and play through the invasion that had happened there&#8211;I thought that was a cool line with a nice payoff. I was surprised how buggy the content was after all this time, though. Because Blizzard does such a nice job of polishing their work, any problem really stands out. I ran into several places where I had to abandon quests and do them over again because a trigger didn&#8217;t work right or something. Still, all things considered, it was far beyond the level of polish most MMOs attain. I hit 85 and was forced to leave, even though I would have liked to check out Deepholm. I flew around that zone and it looked fantastic.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently level 87 in Pandaria, and so far I&#8217;ve been extremely impressed. Both the solo content and the dungeons have been really well done. Cut scenes and cinematics are regularly worked into the content, and the pacing feels very nice. The WoW team has gotten a handle on using phasing to effectively tell stories and show change. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything, but the culmination of the Jade Forest quests was extremely impressive. This zone felt like the best example of storytelling I&#8217;ve seen in any MMO to date&#8211;newer titles included.</p>
<p>At this point, the biggest negative I can point out is that WoW feels burdened by its aging quest mechanics. The whole paradigm of walking into a hub and loading up my quest journal feels so old and dated. I much prefer the GW2 approach of entering an area and being given objectives relevant to what I can see going on around me. Instead of being ordered to kill 10 of this and collect 8 of that, I&#8217;m urged to defend the keep, drive out the centaurs, and other goal-oriented play. It&#8217;s a distinction purely of presentation&#8211;you end up collecting X of this and killing Y of that&#8211;but one method makes the world feel much more alive than the other. The rare moments in WoW when I can forget about the quest journal and just engage with the content are by far my favorites.</p>
<p>Not sure what I&#8217;ll do when I hit the level cap, but for now I&#8217;m very much enjoying my return to Azeroth&#8211;monkey poop and all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reading an article called &#8220;<a title="Because we all need psychoanalysis" href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-04-08-the-psychological-appeal-of-violent-shooters" target="_blank">The Psychological Appeal of Violent Shooters</a>&#8221; and thought it had some interesting correlations to MMOs.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In their book, Glued to Games: How Video Games Draw Us In and Hold Us Spellbound, Rigby and Ryan describe &#8220;self-determination theory,&#8221; a fairly well established framework that aims to describe why people pursue certain voluntary activities. In part, self-determination theory says that people are motivated to engage in activities to the extent that they satisfy three psychological needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Competence &#8211; progressing in skill and power.</li>
<li>2. Autonomy &#8211; being able to choose from multiple, meaningful options.</li>
<li>3. Relatedness &#8211; feeling important to others.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The article asserts that most shooters do a pretty good job of meeting these three needs, although studies indicate the games could be just as satisfying without all the blood and headshots. It&#8217;s worth a read.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about how MMOs come at the three needs outlined above.</p>
<p><strong>Competence</strong></p>
<p>One could argue that the entire <a title="Hello, father." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DikuMUD" target="_blank">DikuMUD</a> style (which was a dominant influence on EverQuest, and therefore most of the MMOs that followed it) is built to satisfy this need: you gain levels or skills, hunt for new and better items, take on increasingly more powerful opponents, <em>ad infinitum</em>. And certainly if you look at early games in the genre, they allowed for the types of emergent gameplay that made players feel skilled and powerful. As an EQ monk called upon to pull in Plane of Fear, Temple of Veeshan, or for raids like the Avatar of War, I felt pride in the skills I possessed which made me better than the average player of my class.</p>
<p>However, one of the frequent complaints about MMOs&#8211;particularly as they age&#8211;is that they&#8217;ve been &#8220;dumbed down&#8221;, made easier for less-skilled players to succeed at. The long list of changes to WoW&#8217;s talent system is an often-cited example of this trend.</p>
<p>We have to admit that MMOs today get mixed marks in this category. Accessibility is a key pillar of most triple-A MMO projects so that the game has the best chance possible of recouping its extravagant budget, and in the process, player competence typically isn&#8217;t a priority target for developers&#8211;even though they often claim that it is. Accessibility is the enemy of player competence.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p>
<p>Using the article&#8217;s definition of this word, MMOs get mixed marks here as well. On the good side, MMOs tend to give players multiple types of content to choose from: leveling up a character solo, doing group dungeons, raiding, crafting, PvP, pet battles, house decorating, dungeon designing, collecting, achievements, and other forms of play are common in MMOs. That&#8217;s a nice variety not present in most other genres.</p>
<p>However, once you delve into each path in detail, it&#8217;s apparent that autonomy isn&#8217;t really present. Most paths in triple-A MMOs, be they narrative-based or achievement-focused, tend to be very linear and without a lot of choice. You might be able to pick which zone you go to at a given level range or which instance you&#8217;ll run, but once that decision is made, you&#8217;re locked in. You can&#8217;t choose how to solve a quest. You can&#8217;t choose the strategy for killing a boss. You can&#8217;t make up your own recipes for making items. You&#8217;re limited to a certain type of housing item or paint color.</p>
<p>MMOs are better at giving you the illusion of autonomy rather than the reality of it. Problems tend to get solved once, and then that becomes the <em>de facto</em> strategy for achieving the desire result (and you get yelled at if you try a different approach). While there are certainly exceptions to this trend, they are few and far between&#8211;at least among triple-A titles.</p>
<p><strong>Relatedness</strong></p>
<p>Importance to others is where MMOs shine. Just about every aspect of MMO gameplay is done better by other genres of games&#8211;shooters are better at fast action, single-player RPGs are better at telling cinematic stories, etc.&#8211;but at least so far, nobody beats MMOs at the social aspects. (Note: This is changing fast! Developers, plan your careers accordingly.)</p>
<p>Skilled players are crucial to a raiding guild. Helpful crafters are the cornerstone of any social guild. Nice people willing to help out someone in trouble allow for those priceless moments of player-to-player interaction that make these games so sticky. Players are the glue that hold MMOs together.</p>
<p>And yet, even MMOs don&#8217;t get a perfect mark here. WoW&#8217;s dungeon finder is the best (worst?) example I can think of. While I have fun jumping easily into content and leaving with shiny new items, all I do is select my role and get pulled into the adventure with a bunch of other players I don&#8217;t know and probably won&#8217;t say a word to unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong. WoW can get away with it because they have so many players and so much to do in the game, yet for smaller titles this would be a terribly depersonalizing experience. Automated matchmaking gets players to the content faster, but ultimately undermine relatedness. When the appeal of the content runs out, players are left with fewer social times to the game itself. This leads to churn, which most MMOs that aren&#8217;t named World of Warcraft are unlikely to overcome.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While current MMOs have a lot going for them, in many ways they have strayed from the early principles that actually satisfied competence, autonomy, and relatedness really well. High production values and expensive cut scenes don&#8217;t make up for these losses. The more you try to force an MMO to feel like another type of game, the less it feels like a distinct genre and the farther you get from the core experiences that made MMOs so popular.</p>
<p>It should be noted that most of my observations above are focused on triple-A themepark MMOs. There are certainly smaller, independent projects that are doing a better job of hitting these marks. Ultimately, it may be refocusing on these core principles that returns the MMO genre to its glory days; if not, its best features will likely be absorbed into other genres. Depending how you look at things, this has already happened and will only escalate from here.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About the only thing you can rely on me to blog about these days is my annual favorite music post. But for the first time, this post has been in danger&#8211;not due to my laziness, but because of my pocketbook.</p>
<p>As anyone reading this knows, 2012 was not the kindest of years to me or my family. Being out of work for one third of the year, I wasn&#8217;t in a position to buy new music for most of the second half of 2012. Though I caught up on a number of releases once I had a few paychecks behind me, there&#8217;s still a long list of music that I just haven&#8217;t been able to pick up yet. I eventually broke down and made a sizable Amazon order (some for physical copies, some digital) since I no longer have my beloved Newbury Comics to visit in person. I haven&#8217;t actually made it to a proper record store since moving to San Diego, which is fairly shameful.</p>
<p>So all apologies to those artists I haven&#8217;t purchased discs from yet: Amanda Palmer, Scott Walker, Best Coast, Bruno Mars, David Byrne &amp; St. Vincent, Bob Mould, and many others. I&#8217;ll get to you as soon as I can. I hope you can live with the disappointment of not being on Steve Danuser&#8217;s year-end list.</p>
<p>Anyway, please consider this posting a regretfully abridged version of my true musical favorites. As usual, I use the Cold Stone Creamery rating system to divide up my selections. Perhaps I&#8217;ll make a follow-up post early in 2013 to tack on a few more titles. Until then, these are the discs I&#8217;ve been turning to time and again over 2012&#8211;a year my soul was in need of music more than ever before.</p>
<p><span id="more-783"></span></p>
<p><strong>&gt; &gt; Like It &lt; &lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paul Banks &#8211; <em>Banks</em></strong> &#8211; When an iconic voice from a familiar band makes a solo record, there is a dangerous line to be trod; it risks coming off as a watered-down version of what the band delivers, or it feels like a desperate attempt to be different. But on <em>Banks</em>, the vocalist of Interpol manages to walk unique ground without, for the most part, falling back on the familiar formula of his band. If there had never been an Interpol, this would still be a really good record worth buying.</p>
<p><strong>Rufus Wainwright &#8211; <em>Out of the Game</em></strong> &#8211; Wainwright is undoubtedly the greatest cabaret singer of his generation&#8230; not that there are a lot of cabaret singers on the scene these days. His voice has never faltered, though I confess his last album&#8211;<em>All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu</em>, a tribute to his mother&#8211;didn&#8217;t resonate with me. I was glad to see Rufus return to form with a fun, sprawling record, even if it doesn&#8217;t quite reach the heights of his soaring <em>Want One</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Tracey Thorn &#8211; <em>Tinsel and Lights</em></strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s unusual for a Christmas album to make my year-end list, but Tracey Thorn&#8217;s voice is so gorgeous and enrapturing that I&#8217;d probably put a recording of her reading the phone book on my annual list. But in all seriousness, this tasteful mix of originals and covers is a wonderful collection that is playable throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>The Shins &#8211; <em>Port of Morrow</em></strong> &#8211; It may sound like a backhanded compliment to say that the Shins are one of alternative music&#8217;s most reliable bands, but I don&#8217;t mean it in a negative way. When you buy one of their albums, you know you&#8217;re going to get quirky, well-crafted pop songs that you can hum along to, with the occasional hook or catchy line that flirts with brilliance. The songs become warm and familiar, if not totally memorable, but that&#8217;s okay&#8211;even without a deeper connection, it is nonetheless satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>The Chieftains &#8211; <em>Voice of Ages</em></strong> &#8211; This venerable Celtic group has made a ton of albums, most of which over the last decade or two have featured swarms of contemporary guest stars of various musical genres. Voice of Ages is no exception, with appearances by Bon Iver, The Civil Wars, The Decemberists, The Low Anthem, Punch Brothers, and many more. Most of the 15 tracks blend the folksy influences of the modern artists with the genuine stuff of the Chieftains. Lovely, and well worth listening to.</p>
<p><strong>The Lumineers &#8211; <em>The Lumineers</em></strong> &#8211; The influence of folk upon popular music has been extremely visible in recent years, to the point where a backlash may be rising among the too-hip-for-this crowd. But that doesn&#8217;t stop the Lumineers from delivering a delightful collection of songs that tip their hat to a folk influence while still feeling fresh and modern.</p>
<p><strong>Norah Jones &#8211; <em>Little Broken Hearts</em></strong> &#8211; Ms. Jones has always had a lovely voice, but it&#8217;s this collaboration with producer extraordinaire Danger Mouse that takes those talented pipes to another level entirely. <em>Little Broken Hearts </em>has a pulpy, film noire quality that comes off like vintage cool meets post-modern pop. It&#8217;s one of those records where, if you didn&#8217;t know the artist, you&#8217;d struggle to guess whether it was made today or 40 years ago. And that&#8217;s pretty damn cool if you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &gt; Love It &lt; &lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dead Can Dance &#8211; <em>Anastasis</em></strong> &#8211; Brooding, pretentious, and lovely, Dead Can Dance has always been greater than the sum of its two principal&#8211;and very talented&#8211;parts. After a long absence, Perry and Gerrard return with a sound that has aged well; <em>Anastasis </em>plugs seamlessly into the band&#8217;s esteemed catalog while still sounding like a record made in 2012. Fans didn&#8217;t hesitate to buy it, but this album deserves a fresh look from a broader audience.</p>
<p><strong>Garbage &#8211; <em>Not Your Kind of People</em></strong> &#8211; If you look at my CD library, you&#8217;d find that Garbage occupies a not-insignificant amount of shelf space. Having collected their many singles and rare compilations, they were one of my favorite bands of the late 90s/early 2000s. They&#8217;ve come back in 2012 without missing a step, and though others have copied the mix of confidence, sexiness, and catchy hooks, I&#8217;ll take the original any day.</p>
<p><strong>Aimee Mann &#8211; <em>Charmer</em></strong> &#8211; In a year when I had to be conscious of spending money, buying a new Aimee Mann record is a no-brainer. Mann&#8217;s records are deliciously crafted, blending soaring choruses with razor-sharp lyrics. Never a note or nuance wasted. <em>Charmer</em> is the kind of album that makes you want to become a musician while simultaneously making you realize you could never be this good.</p>
<p><strong>Light Asylum &#8211; <em>Light Asylum</em></strong> &#8211; If you&#8217;ve ever listened to Ministry&#8217;s mid-80s masterpiece <em>Twitch</em> and found yourself wondering what a true follow-up would have sounded like, then let Light Asylum answer the question for you. This is dark, aggressive dance pop with throbbing industrial undertones. It eschews slick production in favor of gritty immediacy&#8211;it feels like the kind of record a couple of musicians could make in their garage, and that&#8217;s a big part of the charm.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Orton &#8211; <em>Sugaring Season</em></strong> &#8211; Another old favorite returning after a lengthy absence, Orton&#8217;s voice remains warm and distinctive while adding new layers of wisdom and experience. Though I miss the electronic experiments she undertook earlier in her career, the instrumentation on this record is interesting and varied.</p>
<p><strong>Beach House &#8211; <em>Bloom</em></strong> &#8211; Delivering a sound that is shimmering and warm, this band is aptly named. <em>Bloom </em>washes over you like waves crashing against the shore&#8211;that&#8217;s not just a metaphor; if you close your eyes as you listen, you can almost feel it.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Kiwanuka &#8211; <em>Home Again</em></strong> &#8211; This wonderful blend of jazz, funk, folk, and soul sounds as if it could have been recorded in the 60s or 70s&#8211;that is to say, the cool parts of the 60s and 70s, not the kitchy parts. The instrumentation is great, but Kiwanuka&#8217;s voice is the real star here; he could give a young Stevie Wonder a run for his money.</p>
<p><strong>&gt; &gt; Gotta Have It &lt; &lt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lana Del Rey &#8211; <em>Born to Die</em></strong> &#8211; Just to get this out of the way, let&#8217;s be clear: Lana Del Rey is a character, a deliberately sculpted facade. This obvious fact&#8211;coupled with a shaky live performance on SNL&#8211;caused the lovely Ms. Grant to receive her share of backlash, but such theatrics fall well within the bounds of pop music tradition. I c0uld care less about the phenomenon; what wins me over about Lana Del Rey is how brilliantly constructed her music is. The catchy hooks and sharp production blend seamlessly with a Nancy Sinatra-like playfulness. On the surface the lyrics may seem obvious or even trite, but there is a brilliance to them that takes a while to fully appreciate. Del Rey juxtaposes hip-hop stereotypes with lines cribbed from Nabokov. She paints a dreamy, gloomy, disenchanted view of life, all delivered with the hint of a wry smile. <em>Born to Die</em> has been followed up by a series of singles and the <em>Paradise</em> EP, all well worth seeking out. As long as she can find new characters to play, I think Lana will be around for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>The xx &#8211; <em>Coexist</em></strong> &#8211; Trippy, sexy, cold, and romantic, the xx deliver a sophomore LP that lives up to all the promise of their first. The band has no fear of stretching out their grooves, filling their songs with achingly quiet moments that are every bit as captivating as the louder ones. It feels like this entire record could play out upon silken sheets in a breezy bedroom, an intimate affair that you just can&#8217;t walk away from. Shadowy yet warm, mysterious yet familiar. A really great record.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal Castles &#8211; <em>III</em></strong> &#8211; Of all the albums on my 2012 list, Crystal Castles delivers the most unadulterated audio assault. With a different production style, this might be nothing more than a charming, catchy dance record. But when cranked up to appropriate volume, its overwhelming distortion and pulsing grooves not only melt your eardrums, but threaten to warp reality itself. I&#8217;m not exaggerating; driving home late one night, free of any intoxicants in my bloodstream, I blasted this collection of songs and I thought the car was being bent by a black hole. A gorgeous record full of dangerous beats&#8211;listen with caution.</p>
<p><strong>First Aid Kit &#8211; <em>The Lion&#8217;s Roar</em></strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s hard to understand how country music evolved from Patsy Cline and Hank Williams to what gets played on the radio these days, but if popular country sounded more like First Aid Kit, I&#8217;d be wearing cowboy boots and a big ol&#8217; belt buckle. This band captures the charm and songwriting acumen of a young Dolly Parton, delivering simple, soaring tunes that make your feet tap and your heart yearn for quieter days. To dismiss this record as retro is to miss out on something modern and beautiful. It&#8217;s a sweeping, lovely collection of well-written songs that deserves to be played on any radio station, whether you call it country, pop, or alternative.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard Cohen &#8211; <em>Old Ideas</em></strong> &#8211; &#8220;I love to speak with Leonard. He&#8217;s a sportsman and a shepherd. He&#8217;s a lazy bastard living in a suit.&#8221; He also happens to be a bona fide musical treasure, and <em>Old Ideas</em> is, in my opinion, his best album since I&#8217;m Your Man. Nothing else need be said.</p>
<p><strong>Silversun Pickups &#8211; <em>Neck of the Woods</em></strong> &#8211; I must admit that on first listen I missed the early Smashing Pumpkins-like wash of guitars that so dominated their last record, Swoon, but the Pickups soon won me over with the slightly different direction taken by <em>Neck of the Woods</em>. While experimenting with some new sounds and textures&#8211;including one track with a bassline that recalls Peter Hook of New Order&#8211;the strength of the band&#8217;s songwriting hasn&#8217;t changed. This is indie rock at its finest.</p>
<p><strong>Bat For Lashes &#8211; <em>The Haunted Man</em></strong> &#8211; The naked image of singer/songwriter Natasha Khan on the album cover is an apt metaphor for <em>The Haunted Man</em>, as well as a stark contrast to it. The picture is raw and unretouched, much like the openness and directness of the songs, yet the music is anything but black and white. Sometimes direct, sometimes swirling and ephemeral, this is a record that is obscure enough to be interesting but catchy and danceable enough to be accessible. There is a refreshing simplicity that keeps the music honest, and I&#8217;m already rabidly awaiting Khan&#8217;s next effort.</p>
<p><strong>Mumford &amp; Sons &#8211; <em>Babel</em></strong> &#8211; When a band starts out small and obscure only to find themselves seemingly everywhere at once, there is a risk that their core fanbase will be alienated by mass appeal. And so it is with Mumford &amp; Sons, whose last album began as an alterna-folk darling only to sell millions while being played in every tavern and frat house across the U.S. Their follow-up, <em>Babel</em>, is a rollicking collection that happens to be radio friendly in the extreme. Though the snotty former record-store clerk within me is tempted to turn my nose up at such success, the music lover in me wins out&#8211;the songs here, which range from catchy foot-stompers to introspective examinations of love and faith, are just too damn good to be a snob about. This band deserves every bit of attention and success they get.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Eitzel &#8211; <em>Don&#8217;t Be a Stranger</em></strong> &#8211; If the music world were fair and just, Mark Eitzel would routinely be mentioned in the same breath as Michael Stipe, and American Music Club would have made as much money as R.E.M. But life isn&#8217;t fair, and Eitzel has arguably done a much to sabotage his 0wn career as help it. His songs can be awkwardly named, prone to goofiness, and perhaps too numerous; yet they can be startlingly beautiful, deeply moving, and sharply personal. Perhaps the problem is that you never know which Eitzel you&#8217;re going to get&#8230; then again, that&#8217;s part of his charm. In any case, following a near-fatal heart attack, Mark Eitzel has delivered one of his most tightly crafted and meticulously produced solo albums of his career. This is an excellent record of great songs that deserves to be heard.</p>
<p><strong>Cat Power &#8211; <em>Sun</em></strong> &#8211; Early Cat Power records resonate with a ghostly sparseness that parallels the troubled personal life of their creator, Chan Marshall, whose sidewinding career has at times caused her to walk away from songwriting and performing altogether. But whatever Marshall&#8217;s current mental state, there is no trace of fragility on <em>Sun</em>. It is a booming, in-your-face affair that demands the attention of the listener. The songs remain firmly in the alternative camp while borrowing the lyrical cadence of hip-hop, a boldness perhaps fostered by her forays into soul music for her covers album <em>The Greatest</em>. After seeing Cat Power&#8217;s influence on so many artists, it&#8217;s great to have her back again, more vibrant than ever.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Buchanan &#8211; <em>Mid Air</em></strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s been said that while the Velvet Underground didn&#8217;t sell a lot of records, everyone who bought one started their own band. You could likely say much the same about Scottish band the Blue Nile, with the additional footnote that those who were already in bands probably covered one of their songs. The pace at which the Blue Nile has released music is notoriously slow, and singer Paul Buchanan is as much to blame as any other factor. When it seemed that his band had finally stalled out, Buchanan released a solo album of brief, almost fragmented songs&#8230; or, some might argue, fragments of songs, with most barely reaching two minutes in length, featuring breathlessly spare arrangements relying almost exclusively on whispered vocals and soft piano. To me, this is a strength rather than a weakness. The songs on <em>Mid Air</em> are the perfect distillation of what makes the Blue Nile great, and the spareness allows your own mind to fill in the musical gaps. This is one of the most touching records I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>The Ting Tings &#8211; <em>Sounds from Nowheresville</em></strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s rare that I use the word &#8220;sassy&#8221; to describe anything, but that&#8217;s the adjective that pops into my head when I think of the Ting Tings. Everything about <em>Nowheresville</em> is bold and brazen; it&#8217;s loud, aggressive, incessantly catchy, and imminently likable. There&#8217;s something for everyone here, as the band dips into No Doubt-like pop ska on one number before flying into 80s synth-pop on another, only to sprinkle bits of hip-hop into the next. When I&#8217;ve needed an album to yank me out of the dumps&#8211;and that&#8217;s happened plenty of times in 2012&#8211;the Ting Tings never let me down. My record of the year.</p>
