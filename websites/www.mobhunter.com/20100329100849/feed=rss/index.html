		<title>PAXing East Coast Style</title>
		<description>Today I, as well as a throng of coworkers, descended upon the first incarnation of PAX East. Though there wasn't an official 38 Studios presence (no booth or big announcements this year--sorry!), our execs were nice enough to give the team the day off to attend opening day of the ...</description>

		<title>Speaking at VR 2010 Conference</title>
		<description>On Tuesday, March 23, I'll be speaking at the IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 Conference, taking place in nearby Waltham, MA. The panel is titled "Design for Experience?!" and if you look at the list of speakers, I am clearly the dumbest guy in the room. I can only assume they ...</description>

		<title>Alienware M11x &#8211; A Practial Review</title>
		<description>I began researching netbooks--small laptops aimed mostly at Web browsing--several months ago. I do a fair bit of traveling, and while I love my current machine, lugging the 17" beast through airports has never been what I would call a treat. Not to mention the fact that a large notebook ...</description>

		<title>Industry Reset Buttons</title>
		<description>The hot industry trend is evangelizing social games. Many took up this habit fairly recently, playing catch-up at shows like DICE last week. The Kosters of the world have been atop their social soapboxes for years.

The aspect I find interesting is that a number of, shall we say, developers of ...</description>

		<title>Wisdom Worthy of Dusting Off This Blog to Restate</title>
		<description>Truer words have never been spoken.
"I'm going to go out on a limb here, and assert that setting a realistic scope is one of the most difficult challenges an MMO producer will face."
Lum understates his point. He shouldn't.

Scope is a balancing act. When making an MMO that seeks to evolve ...</description>

		<title>My Favorite Music of 2009</title>
		<description>Many of my favorite bands didn't release new records this year, so I'd have to say I was a bit disappointed with 2009 overall. Still, there were plenty of gems worth purchasing.

It's also interesting how many live albums showed up on my list. I enjoy live albums when bands add ...</description>

		<title>I Was Not, in Fact, Mugged in London</title>
		<description>Yesterday one of my web email accounts was compromised and someone sent a mass email to my contact list saying that I had been mugged in London and was deprived of all my cash and credit cards, and that if someone couldn't wire me cash I would be thrown out ...</description>

		<title>Stop Copying Our Totally Original Designs!</title>
		<description>It's a widely known fact that Blizzard invented the achievement-based fantasy MMO, and one of WoW's producers has given an interview to PC Zone magazine explaining why copying this unique blueprint is a bad idea.

When World of Warcraft sprang wholecloth from the minds of Blizzard back in 2004, there simply ...</description>

		<title>To All the Turkeys Out There</title>
		<description>Happy Thanksgiving! I have a tremendous amount to be thankful for--a healthy family, a job I love, and great friends to cherish.

Soon I'll be posting my year-end music roundup, and may even have a thing or two to say about game design sometime. Have a happy holiday, everyone. </description>

		<title>I Have Been to the Summit, and It Was Good</title>
		<description>The inaugural GameX Industry Summit last weekend was a great time. Naturally there were a few hiccups--being the first time the show was held--but the content of the event was terrific.

A few of my favorite bits were the Saturday afternoon keynote by Chris Foster of Harmonix, a post mortem on ...</description>
