This product will not be available in stores.  This extension will include some great new gameplay features, as well as new zones for characters ranging from level 35 up to level 60.<p>Legacy of Ykesha Features include:<p>A new playable race: Frogloks<br>Enhanced Looking For Group Tool<br>New Cartography System<br>New Magic Item slot: Charms<br>Armor Dyes<br>Dozens of new creatures<br>Expanded bank capacity<br>New zones<br>New spells<p>For more information, please visit www.legacyofykesha.com<p>*** Patch Information ***<p>** Gameplay/Features **<p>- With our last patch and the patch today, we've significantly reduced the amount of bandwidth that EverQuest needs to use, even in large raid or extremely-crowded-zone situations.<br>- Fixed a problem with tints not properly updating when armor is removed.<br>- Fixed a bug with character faces displaying incorrectly to other players when you zone in after them.<br>- Fixed resurrection timer that was counting down against the 3 hour limit when player was not logged in. <br>- Corrected a problem with health and movement updates being delayed.<p>** Spells **<p>- NPCs will now notice Druid and Shaman Percentage Heal spells in a manner similar to traditional healing spells.<br>- Removed the chance for slow spells to be reversed from the 17 NPCs that had this ability.<br>- Fixed a bug that was preventing Curses, Diseases, and Poisons from being removed.<br>- Raised all recast times below 2.25 seconds up to 2.25 seconds.  This is a change in the spell data as the first part of a two-part change needed to correct the &quot;Recast time not met&quot; problem.  More information is available at the Developer's Corner at www.everquest.com.<p>** Alternate Advancement/Special Abilities **<p>- The range on the Bard Ability &quot;Boastful Bellow&quot; has been increased slightly.<br>- Fixed a bug with Harm Touch that was not allowing it to increase the standard amount per level over level 60.<p>** User Interface **<p>- Fixed a bug with effects in the Songs window.  They were not getting removed on the client when the bard was dispelled.<br>- Introduced new Story window.  The purpose of this window is to provide story updates in a readily available location.  ALT-N toggles the window.  You can select to have the window pop up when new story elements are added if you wish.<br>- Item Links are once again creatable from Items and from other Item Links.  Please do not attempt to &quot;mine&quot; the servers for undiscovered items.  Links now have a built-in mechanism to prevent those who would go on fishing expeditions by sending up many bad links in an attempt to discover new items.  These invalid links are logged, as are the accounts of those who create them.<br>- Added an optional confirmation box before spending AA points.  To turn on this confirmation box, please check the Options window.<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Sage Quests in Plane of Knowledge have been fixed.<br>- The event to fight Bertoxxulous in the Crypt of Decay will reset 4 to 6 hours after the event is failed.  It will respawn normally if the event is won.<p>** New/Changed Interface Files **<p>- EQUI_StoryWnd.xml (actually added with the Jan. 9th patch)<br>- EQUI_OptionsWnd.xml</B><p>In addition to all the expected bug fixes detailed in our last story, SKs get a little boost to Harm Touch and bards see their recently nerfed AA ability get a small boost. The change to the Bertox event is nice, and the fix to the corpse rez timer is very much welcome.<p>Okay, time to talk about LoY.<p>The idea of a download-only expansion is long overdue (this also explains why it was priced at only $18 when it accidentally found its way to the EQ store yesterday). I was a bit startled to see the patcher give me the option of pre-downloading files--a very nice touch indeed. Eliminating the need for packaging and printed manuals (as well as production of CDs) should cut down on distribution time by quite a bit. Guess we'll find out soon when the expansion will actually be available.<p>As for features, the playable froglok race was not unexpected. Given the popularity of the froglok illusion spell (Povar's Triton guild has basically made it a raiding requirement, I think), players should enjoy making little froggie alts. We hope SOE keeps the froglok models pretty much the way they are now rather than bulking them up along the lines of most Luclin models. All that's necessary is the ability to display armor, throw in some skin and eye color options, and add a bunch of animations.<p>While on the subject, here's hoping SOE pays attention to that poll they conducted a few months back and <B>adds new character animations to the Luclin models.</B> The majority of them are either jerky, silly, or just plain poorly done. 2HB, anyone? Didn't think so. <I>Please, please, please</I> fix them.<p>The other features don't sound groundbreaking, but are cool nonetheless. More bank space, better LFG options, some kind of mapping ability, and being able to dye armors sounds promising. A new item slot sounds great--more stats!--but every single custom UI will have to be redone to accomodate it.<p>Mid- to upper-level players that this expansion is geared towards should be pleased, as it answers many of the criticisms of Planes of Power. But I must confess I was hoping for at least a couple 61-65 exp zone options. The actual number of places a level 65 person can exp in PoP is painfully small.<p>The <a href="https://store.station.sony.com/digitalDistribution/digitalDistribution.jsp?SKU=EQLOY-DD-SW0303-LOYDID">product page</a> at the EQ store gives a few more details, and lists the availability date as <B>February 24.</B> That's pretty fast! Also of note is the following disclaimer from said page:<p><B>Expect heavy patch server load, difficulty connecting and the possibility of unscheduled downtime on the live date and for a few days thereafter. Expect that patches may be large and take significant time to download.</B><p>Modem users may not be happy about the download-only thing, but I'm sure enterprising sorts can figure out a means to get those files another way. Sounds like most of it will download bit by bit in the coming weeks anyway.<p>No word on the number of zones or what other features will be included. Information on this extension (not expansion, apparently) will be released over time rather than all at once.<p><B>*** Updated ***</B><p>The official <a href="http://www.legacyofykesha.com">Legacy of Ykesha</a> site has been updated with info on <a href="http://www.legacyofykesha.com/f_froglok.jsp">frogloks as a playable race</a>. They have enhanced swimming, breathing, and ultravision, and can be clerics, shamans, wizards, warriors, and paladins.<p>If you listen, you can almost hear the shouting on the paladin boards from here.<p>According to <a href="http://www.legacyofykesha.com/f_froglok-detail.jsp">froglok lore</a>, it sounds like the barbarians are the offspring of Erollisi Marr being implanted with Mithaniel Marr's &quot;Gift of Life.&quot; Mithaniel and Erollisi being brother and sister, you realize. Seems that incest isn't forbidden by the paladin code of conduct.<p>There are also screenshots and .avi files of the [sigh] new froglok models. Admittedly, they look pretty promising, though I'll always be fond of the old look. Sounds like Guk will be the starting city for froglok player characters, so maybe the upper zone will see a bit of revamping before the expansion goes live.<p>More details to follow, I'm sure.<p><BIG>Recast Redux</BIG><p>Those who panicked when they saw all the changes to recast timers on Lucy should take some comfort in the <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53662">explanation</A> posted on Dev Corner:<p><B>We've made some changes to spell recasting delay with the patch on January 15th. This change may seem worse than it actually is, so we wanted to be sure it's well explained to avoid unnecessary concern. <p>When a player casts a spell in EverQuest, their spell gems grey out and become unusable for a period of just over two seconds. After these two seconds have passed, the spell gems ungrey and can be used again. Some specific spells have longer than the minimum 2.25 seconds recasting delay, and they take longer before they are ready to be cast again. However, no spell was legitimately recastable in less than 2.25 seconds. <p>With the old EverQuest interface, the minimum recast delay was enforced on the game client and it worked well. With the introduction of the new interface though, we've run into issues where your spell gems would ungrey and appear ready sooner than the minimum recast delay. When this happened, players would sometimes get the message &quot;Recast time not met&quot; when they tried to cast a spell, and the spell would fail. This is very annoying for players, and can certainly be dangerous in many situations. <p>We've applied that 2.25 minimum recast delay directly to the spell data. Most spells already had more than the minimum recast delay, but those that did not have now been changed. In many cases, this makes it appear that a spell that used to have no recast delay now has 2.25 seconds recast delay. In actual use though, nothing has actually changed - in the past, casters always had to wait 2.25 seconds for the spell gems to become ready, and the wait will be the same now, it just appears differently in the spell data. <p>This change isn't intended to make spell casting slower or more difficult. Now that we've fully transitioned to the new interface it's simply the best way to continue enforcing the same delay that's always been there. <p>This is the first part of a two-part change that we're making to correct the &quot;Recast time not met&quot; issue. The next step needs to be made in code and should appear on the Test server soon.</B><p>Awww, no big evil plan to screw over casters. Damn. The Dev Team is just going to have to try harder next time.<p><BIG>One Boat Full Already</BIG><p>The slight controversy that has surrounded the recent SOE/Ubi Soft free Euro character transfer offer hasn't stopped the British server from <A HREF="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/news_section/newsview.jsp?story=53661">filling up</A> in record time:<p><B>Thank you for your interest and support of the free Euro Character Transfer. We have achieved our goal of 1000 moves to the UK based server, Venril Sathir. We are no longer accepting request for free moves to this server. <p>Free Character moves are still being offered for the French and German based servers, Sebilis and Kael Drakkal respectively.<p>Once we meet our goal of 1000 moves to all three servers, this offer will end. After which time, anyone wanting to transfer a character to a new server may do so through our standard Character Transfer Service according to the <A HREF="https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves/">current rules and prices</A>.<p>Once again, thank you for your interest in this special offer.</B><p>We hope that all ten uberguilds who moved to the VS server will be very happy together.<p>In all seriousness, it will be interesting to see the effect of these moves upon the current population. I'd also be curious to find out if any large guilds decided to move to the new servers, so if you have any such juicy gossip feel free to post it below.<br>
