Here we will explain how these changes may affect your system's ability to run this expansion. The new specifications are listed below:<p>Required Specs:<p>- Windows(r) 98/2000/ME/XP <br>- Pentium(r) II 400Mhz or greater <br>- 256 MB RAM <br>- 16 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&amp;L (i.e. Nvidia GeForce/GeForce 2) <br>- DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card <br>- 28.8 K+ Internet connection <br>- 4X speed CD-ROM <br>- 450 MB+ hard drive space<p>Note: Although technically below the minimum specs, players with 128 MB of RAM will still be able to run Luclin by turning off the new character models.<p>Recommended Specs:<p>- Windows(r) 98/2000/ME/XP <br>- Pentium(r) III or greater <br>- 512 MB RAM <br>- 32 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&amp;L (i.e. Nvidia GeForce 2 or greater) <br>- DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card <br>- 56.6 K+ Internet connection <br>- 16X speed CD-ROM <br>- 1.5 GB+ hard drive space<p>Note: DirectX 8.0 or greater is required. System requirements subject to change as the game progresses. <p>*Internet Play*<p>EverQuest is an internet-only game, requiring players to connect to Sony Online Entertainment servers via their own Internet connection for which they are responsible. Additional online fees and valid credit card required.<p>EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin is unique as an expansion to an existing product. Rather than simply more zones, more items, and more encounters, Shadows of Luclin goes several leaps further and includes an almost entirely new graphics engine, and with that engine, new player character models which change the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the world dramatically.<p>In creating these new player characters, the goal was to provide the highest quality models ever seen in a first person game. Every model was made extremely detailed, in many cases ten times the complexity of the original models in EQ. Rather than simply &quot;catch up&quot; with current technology, Shadows of Luclin raises the bar even higher. <p>*Minimum Required RAM*<p>The amount of memory required to display 40 all-new models with high quality textures, realistic bone structures, etc., greatly increased polygon counts and as such we have changed our minimum memory requirement to 256MB of RAM, and our recommended to 512MB of RAM. <p>Although technically below minimum specifications, EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin WILL run with 128M of ram, and you will be able to see all the new zones, the new race (Vah Shir) and the new class (Beastlord) without much decrease in performance. However, if you want to see all the new models you will need at least 256MB of RAM. Even at 256MB you may need to modify new graphical options we will be providing. If you want smooth performance and fast loading times, we recommend that you get 512MB of RAM. <p>Additional menus are added for those with 256MB of RAM to tune which models are loaded (among many other options we will be providing), further increasing performance. For example, you may choose to see the Troll Male but not the Ogre Female. Fewer new models will reduce the amount of memory EverQuest requires. <p>We understand that this may be upsetting to those caught off guard by the increase in memory requirements. But rather than reducing the detail of the character models we have in order to display them all at lower quality with 128MB RAM, with only minor improvements for players with 512MB of RAM, we felt it better to create models that would remain &quot;high quality&quot; for years to come.<p>*Hardware T&amp;L*<p>Along with these changes, a new graphics engine which supports hardware T&amp;L is included. If you have a graphics card with hardware T&amp;L, you should see much higher frame rates in all zones, not just Shadows of Luclin zones. However, some older cards may have trouble displaying all the new player models with their increased polygon counts. This is why we recommend a GeForce 2 or better video card. See your video card manufacturer's website to determine if your card includes hardware T&amp;L support. A list of models supported in EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin will be presented on the official EverQuest website very soon.<p>Again, no features of EverQuest: Shadows of Luclin will be lost even at 128M of RAM, except for the ability to see the new player models. The rest of the rich world, along with the new graphics enhancements, will work. The Shadows of Luclin still has more zones, more new NPCs, and more exciting encounters than any other expansion, as well as a new class AND a new race to enjoy. As you upgrade your computer to 256MB and 512MB of RAM, and obtain future graphics cards, your EverQuest experience will be enhanced right along with them.<p>***<p>Please visit http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/sysreq.jsp to review this note, along with a number of screenshots, in your browser.<p>- The EverQuest Team</B><p>----------------------------------------<p>So, what do you think? Is Verant planning for the future, or alienating users in the present? The final judgement will have to wait until we actually play the game, of course, but you don't have to go very far into any EQ message board to see lots of <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=20659.topic">frustration</a> and <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=17559.topic">concern</a>.<p>Perhaps a better question is this... If Shadows of Luclin--a.k.a. EverQuest 1.5--has requirements this hefty, what are they designing EQ2 to be run on?
