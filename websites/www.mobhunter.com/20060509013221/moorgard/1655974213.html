<html><head><title>Few and Far Between</title></head><body><h1>Few and Far Between</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-10-29</p><BIG>Ze Planes, Seven Days In</BIG><p>Planes of Power has officially been released for a week now, and despite the cries of an unhappy minority, it's working pretty well. There hasn't been that much downtime, and the expansion seems to have done the trick of providing new content for higher-end players while still giving lower-level folks some value.<p>Not everything is perfect, of course. Spell drops are hard to come by, though it seems that since the first tier of planar zones (Disease, Innovation, Nightmare, Justice) were brought down yesterday afternoon, parchments have started dropping rarely off common mobs. This should ease the minds of casters a bit at least. Now if only they could avoid getting duplicate spells.<p>Loot drops are also a bit suspect right now, especially off the first tier planar bosses. On the plus side, we aren't seeing rabid MUDflation out of the gates; on the negative side, mobs that take quite a bit of effort to get to and kill are not paying off very well for the time put in. If the loot situation doesn't show improvement in tier two and beyond, we're going to start getting nervous. But at the very least, PoP should make all the NToV farmers thankful for easy mobs that still drop money loot.<p>There also seems to be a legitimate bug in some people's exp bars. Several threads have <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=0602f2ddb3d0b8635d64b6b2751c0831&amp;threadid=7196">popped up</a>, including over on Verant's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/033094.html">Tech Help board</a>. It seems some folks are dying in level 61+ and are having their exp bars freeze up. Some are even claiming to have been delevelled down to 50. There has been no official acknowledgement yet, but hopefully Verant is investigating the case.<p><BIG>Mister Fister</BIG><p>Over on the monk board, parsing seems to indicate that <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=33809.topic">bare fists at 65</a> have become rather potent weapons. Preliminary data shows that a naked human monk's fists are in the neighborhood of being 18/20 weapons.<p>Now before other melee cry foul over monks getting some rather godly weapons for free, keep in mind that not many monks would even use them, for a couple reasons. First, most level 65 monks would have access to some pretty nice weapons, and even if 18/20 is a better ratio, such monks would be remiss to throw away weapons that give 100hp or more plus stats. Second, using bare fists means that the monk cannot have his epic equipped, as the epic turns the monk's bare fists into 9/16 weapons.<p>Some monks are managing to whine about the free upgrade, since it would &quot;force&quot; them to abandon their beloved epic--something most other classes did well over a year ago. These monks want Verant to upgrade their epics for free, or at least remove whatever makes their fists 9/16. Maybe these monks also want fries and a milkshake, too.<p>Honestly, even if this data is correct it's going to have zero impact on the game, aside from giving nice weapons to whatever non-uberguild monks manage to reach 65. Seeing monks whining about this being a bad thing in any way, shape, or form is laughable, and my own class earns Mobhunter's &quot;Whiner of the Week&quot; award.<p><BIG>Quadding Doth Not Be Valorous</BIG><p>Over on Test server, a <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=22385.topic">recent change</a> signals the end of  free-flowing exp for quadders. Mobs in the Plane of Valor are being upgraded such that soloers won't be able to kite there. Given the high level of the mobs involved, this is a reasonable change.<p>Hey, I'm all for people getting good exp--now more than ever. But for a couple classes to be able to do this while others have to beg for groups is clearly unbalanced.<p>Valor, by the way, is a tier two plane, meaning you have to gain access to it through questing and such. In the case of Valor, you get in by succeeding at a trial in the Plane of Justice. While not easy, these trials can be a lot of fun. Except for the dying over and over trying to learn them part.<p>Okay, that's all for this slack news update. Hey, I'm sneaking this in on a coworker's computer over lunch, so don't yell at me about typos. Once I'm settled, news updates should once again be a little more free-flowing. Oh, I bet you're drooling.
