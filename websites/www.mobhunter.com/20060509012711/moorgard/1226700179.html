We apologize but the Character Transfer service is temporarily down for maintenance. We are hoping to bring it back Online shortly.<br>Many requests have been received and we are processing them as quickly as possible, but because of the volume, some character transfers may take up to three weeks to complete. <br>Thank you for your continued support. <p>-The EverQuest Team</B><p>How many people on message boards everywhere were complaining about the outrageous price Verant was charging for this service?<p>Not as many as are taking advantage of said service, it would seem.<p>Maybe the real reason for the delay is that Brad needs three weeks to decide whether to buy a summer home in the Hamptons or a ski lodge in Aspen. Heck, with the fat bonus he's got to be getting for wildly increasing Verant's revenue, maybe he'll just buy them both.
