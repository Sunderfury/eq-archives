		<description><![CDATA[I think the problem is that we assume this movie is for us first and foremost, instead of being a welcoming for new fans; a place for them to jump in. And we forget that we&#039;re not looking at this movie through our young, naive eyes anymore. When it was first released, there was nothing like it (visually -- there was everything like it storywise).  TFA now is a reflection of the society we live in where 140 characters tells a story. There are so many ridiculous plot holes in this movie. So many astounding leaps required of the audience&#039;s suspension of disbelief. But in the moment, it works. In the moment, when I was sitting with my 7yo daughter on my lap and when she came out of the theatre and told me how much she loved Rey and Poe, I was very, very happy to be able to -- not pass this torch -- but share it with her. 

More practically speaking, Star Wars was initially Lucas fanboying over the stories he loved, and then it became him selling toys. It&#039;s no different now, though more hands are in the pot, grabbing at that cash. I&#039;d like to believe that even though money is the top priority, those involved in the resurgence of this legacy have put their heart and soul into it because they love Star Wars too. 

That said, I am cautiously optimistic about where things will go for the future movies now that everything has been established. I hope it does slow down a bit to tell a proper story that doesn&#039;t rely on convenient coincidental plot devices and bigger explosions. Abrams sucked in the newcomers and established fans with all sorts of questions to ponder. I don&#039;t want the next movies to fill in all the blanks as the prequel tried to, but I do hope for more depth and meaning in those blanks.

		<description><![CDATA[I felt a lot of ambiguity in my enthusiasm, some sense that they were trying to borrow a bit too much to ground the new movie, and had a couple WTF moments (so that was The New Republic, was it?), but I also have to ask myself if I have changed over time.  What could have possibly pleased me these days?  After the original, and then The Empire Strikes Back, everything has been a step down, both in quality and in my ability to feel a part of it.  That TFA was a step up from the prequels should make me happy enough and maybe it will get tuned over the ongoing series.  I still had a good time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Finally, yes! Thank you Steve. I agree with you completely. I might even take it a little bit further and say there were parts that were so downright horribly written, horribly directed, to the point they make me wonder how Abrams will possibly escape the same treatment Lucas received for similar choices.]]></description>
