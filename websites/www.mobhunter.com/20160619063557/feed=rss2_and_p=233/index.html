		<description><![CDATA[I fully agree with you in that we are not using all the tools available to us when narrating stories in MMOs, but considering how much you have to spend on creating an interesting cut-scene, within a beautiful environment, with long animation sequences to narrate an event visually (the way most would like to see it done) and comparing that to a single written sentence, with a time/capital cost of less that 1/100 of the first choice, I can understand why many developers are forced to pick the second option, and the fact that we go for the cheaper options despite knowing that player crave for great visuals and epic scenery is a growing problem in the entire game industry. Game companies nowadays are made up of a small number of managers who care mostly about costs, and who have little understanding for narrative aesthetics, and a large number of &quot;real&quot; developers, who are either too junior to have developed that sense, or who wield too little power to actually turn their highest ideals into realities. In MMO development, the sheer volume of work is so great, that focusing on the quality of each single part/quest simply becomes unfeasible from a cost point of view. Sad but true: we are mass-producing games nowadays, and just like any other mass-produced product, quality and at some point, variety will suffer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting post, Moorgard.

I&#039;ve recently come to a similar realization, not necessarily about MMOs, but about Pen and Paper games as well. 

I&#039;m sure you know the 4th Edition of D&amp;D was released not long ago, and I&#039;ve since been working on a new campaign for my friends to run through using my own world. While I had written plenty of material on the world and its inhabitants before, I found that when preparing a campaign to be played through you are really quite limited when it came to using actual words - you don&#039;t want to bore your players to death reading excessive descriptions and narrative. I quickly adapted to this new style of storytelling using the same methods you mentioned: dungeon details, environmental clues, monster visuals and personalities, and item drops all became tools I had to use to slowly ease in the overall theme and message of the area. 

That being said, I completely agree with your assessment that MMORPG writers need to be able to do more than weave together fancy sentences which most players wont read anyway. Coming up with ways to blanket an entire area or zone in the lore you are trying to get across is much more effective.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really have to agree.  The later Elder Scrolls games also fell victim to the &quot;walls of text&quot; phenomenon, featuring screen after screen of text in books, letters, etc that was used to flesh out the lore of the world -- but was oh-so-boring to play though.

I think that the classic &quot;Out of this World&quot; was a great example of storytelling -- and nobody spoke at all (at least, not in a language one could understand)!]]></description>
