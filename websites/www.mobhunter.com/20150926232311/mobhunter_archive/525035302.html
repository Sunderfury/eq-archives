<html><head><title>Once More Unto the Breach</title></head><body><h1>Once More Unto the Breach</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-11-20</p><BIG>Full of Sound and Furor</BIG><p>Progress through the Planes of Power is continuing at a feverish pace. Over on the Veeshan server, the notorious <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/html/index.php">Fires of Heaven</a> guild (who really, really want you to know that they weren't in the beta) has just clobbered Solusek Ro, gaining access for the first time to the Plane of Fire.<p>While wizards <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=23095.topic">lament</a> the lack of class-specific loot on their patron deity, others are expressing <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=12381.topic">concern</a> that guilds are progressing through the expansion too quickly.<p>While a handful of guilds are moving fast, I don't think there's cause for concern yet. PoP is unlike other expansions in that you can't just waltz into most zones--you need to work your way to them. Just because the majority of the zones have been accessed doesn't mean they all will be &quot;solved&quot; so quickly. If you think back to Velious (a more fair comparison to PoP than Luclin is), while most zones were accessible fairly quickly, it took a while for the content to be finished.<p>Of course, if Plane of Time is cleared one month from now, I'll eat my words. Personally, I'm hoping there will be some AoW-like encounters that cause even the uberguilds to fail and fail and fail again before finally conquering the big bad.<p><BIG>Fizzle Me Not</BIG><p>Paladins got excited over what appeared to be a <a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=17220.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25">snare spell</a> showing up on Test server. Though paladins drooled, Absor was quick to explain the error of their ways:<p><B>We don't have any intention of giving Paladins snare. The spell that's presently being parsed is part of an internal test of fizzle rates as they affect hybrid classes. So the first part of the title of this thread is rather appropriate.</B><p>The title of the thread? &quot;Don't jump to conclusions, but...&quot;<p>At any rate, looking at hybrid fizzle rates is a good thing. While hybrids shouldn't be quite as good at spell casting as the &quot;pure&quot; classes, they shouldn't completely suck, either.<p>Hey, did I just say hybrids completely suck? /ducks<p><BIG>Life Without Head</BIG><p>Part of the big patch yesterday was a revamp to Skyshrine. Lord Yelinak got some new roommates, who brought some new loot along with them. But it seems old Yelly's treasure trove has dried up just a bit, as he <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?s=f28a855feaeea41c5c38ba06ad118873&amp;threadid=14161">no longer drops his head or talisman</a>--the latter of which was used to make a key to Sleeper's Tomb.<p>The ST key change may be intentional. Since the revamp to Sleeper's, the plot to the place has changed. The dragons are getting anxious about Kerafyrm being loose, and there's some tie-in with the giants that is <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=5643.topic">long and complicated</a>. It may have something to do with why certain giants now drop ST key talismans, but reading about the whole thing makes my head hurt--and only serves to remind me how bungled the whole Sleeper storyline was.<p>Why Yelinak would no longer drop his head, though, is quite a mystery. Must be some new kind of dragon magic that leaves a headless corpse behind, apparently. Crafty dragons!<p><BIG>Sword No More</BIG><p>Another recent change (not really from yesterday's patch) is the nerfing of the drop rate of the fabled <a href="http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm12.showMessage?topicID=2061.topic">windblade</a>. <p>This 50/44 axe was dropping like candy in Halls of Honor, and since it wasn't no-drop there were tons of them flooding the market. Prices in the Bazaar on many servers were dipping to 20k or less--unheard of for a weapon of this quality. Paladins and SKs especially were in heaven (as much as SKs can ever be, I guess).<p>After the zone was taken down a few nights ago, however, campers have reported almost no drops of the blade, sending prices back up to the 75k range that you might expect for a weapon with those stats. While many are complaining that the nerf was uncalled for, there are a lot of folks who found the easy accessibility of the weapon to be unbalancing.<p>Verant wasn't as quick about this nerf as one might have thought they would be. Maybe they wanted to give the common people a little taste of uberness--if only for a little while.<p><BIG>You Are the Words, I Am the Tune</BIG><p>Over on the EQ Live site, some handy <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52825">mp3 player tips</a> were posted to help you get the most out of this dandy little freebie. For instance, here's how to add a whole bunch of songs to your playlist at once:<p><B>You can use wildcards when specifying files to load. For example, if you click &quot;Add&quot;, browse down to C:MyMusic, then type &quot;*.mp3&quot; in the edit window portion of the File Selection Window, then click &quot;Ok&quot;, the Music Player Window will attempt to add all files in the C:MyMusic directory that end in mp3.</B><p>This is much appreciated, since adding songs one by one is the suck. While this isn't the fanciest mp3 player you can lay your hands on, it ain't bad, either.<p>And of course we know you aren't playing any illegally obtained mp3 files, right? I wouldn't want to have to sick the Recording Industry Tyrants of America on you.
