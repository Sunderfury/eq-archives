				<div class="entry">
					<p>There&#8217;s <a title="And it's flame free!" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/37038-favorite-mmorpg-weapon-item.html" target="_blank">a great thread</a> over at Fires of Heaven asking posters to list their favorite weapons and armor from any MMOG. Not surprisingly, the original EverQuest dominates the list.</p>
<p>Partly this is because the FoH board has its roots firmly in EQ, but there&#8217;s more to it than that. EverQuest had memorable items because, at least in the early days, it had no rules. Modern MMOGs like WoW and EQ2 have pretty strict item creation guidelines which give designers a set budget to spend when creating weapons and armor. Sure, the high-end game has great loot with effects that make you drool over them, but there are very few that stand out as truly unique or indispensable. They simply hold you over until the next level cap increase, when even the uberest of loot will be replaced.</p>
<p>EQ also started with no level restrictions on items. This had the interesting effect that there was no stigma associated with wearing an item you got at level 30 when you were level 50. Many of the most desirable items were hard to get because they came from rare spawns, not necessarily because they were raid drops or from the highest-level dungeons.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s game designers will tell you that original EQ&#8217;s itemization was broken. You want players to feel like they&#8217;re making steady progress, leaving old gear behind while shooting for the new stuff. But broken or not, no other MMOG has made me put as much time into planning my gear as EQ did. I had a three-ring binder full of printouts listing items I longed to get. While I do pay attention to certain gear in WoW, it&#8217;s really only raid drops that are worth paying attention to. As far as regular gear goes, you can pick up stuff you need as you quest, level grind, or PvP.</p>
<p>Modern itemization is technically &#8220;better&#8221; in that it is balanced and offers measurable progress. But there is an undeniable magic to items that break the rules and really stand out in players&#8217; hearts and minds. It may be true that there will never be another major MMOG that features the Wild West itemization of old EQ. But maybe, just maybe, there will be games that break the rules every so often and create some gear that remains memorable.</p>
<p>Oh, and my vote? Gotta be the Shroud of Longevity and Celestial Fists, because obtaining those two items alongside my guildmates gave me the greatest sense of accomplishment in any MMOG I&#8217;ve played. Although I have to give props to the Flowing Black Silk Sash and the Hero Bracers (the latter which I farmedÂ  incessantly so that I could afford the former), and the original granddaddy of raid loot: the Cloak of Flames.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Like so many others, I have been lured by the call of the Lich King. After drifting off into AoC and WAR for a while, one appreciates just how polished and solid the act of playing WoW is. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s perfect; rather, I mean the fact that there usually aren&#8217;t stupid little annoyances that gnaw away at your urge to play like so many rabid chipmunks.</p>
<p>My main in WoW has been an undead warrior, a character of which I&#8217;ve never been especially fond. As a DPS build, I pretended he was a monk in order to get through the day. As an undead, I pretended he used to be an attractive human (unlike the human models in WoW, which I can&#8217;t stand). You might guess based upon my general malaise that I was a prime candidate to try out the death knight, and you&#8217;d be right.</p>
<p>General impressions and a couple spoilers after the break. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=376#more-376" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>The BioWare Austin folks are talking a lot about Star Wars: The Old Republic. And they should, because it&#8217;s without question one of the most anticipated MMOGs on the horizon, thanks in no small part to BioWare&#8217;s reputation for making quality games.</p>
<p>Besides meditating on <a title="The Force was REALLY generous to this one" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/47423" target="_blank">the size of one&#8217;s lightsaber</a>, a major point of emphasis that the devs focus on is the role of the player as hero. For instance, the lead writer discusses <a title="That's a mighty big slug" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/10/24/the-old-republic-unveiled-leveling-sidekicking-and-questing/" target="_blank">making the player feel heroic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daniel Erickson, Lead Writer BioWare Austin:</span> The k&#8217;lor&#8217;slug is 20 feet tall, and horrible, and can eat your face &#8230; and that&#8217;s what you fight at level one as a Sith. The first thing you ever fight in the game is that thing. And you never do anything less heroic than that. There are no bunnies, no rabbits, no snakes &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>A noble goal, that of relieving players of the burden of killing all those tens of rats. This has caused many to consider the role of the hero, including <a title="Link to a lesser blog" href="http://38pitches.com/2008/10/24/mmo-design-and-development/" target="_blank">some folks I happen to know</a>. But while I agree with the general goal of making the player feel heroic, there&#8217;s a lot more to it than just the type of creatures they fight. <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=369#more-369" class="more-link">Continue Reading &raquo;</a></p>

					<p>Wow.</p>
<p>An obvious exclamation to use after returning from BlizzCon, but it fits. This was an amazing event in so many ways. Anyone savvy enough to find this blog doesn&#8217;t need me to point to the multitude of links recapping the show (Massively alone wrote like a hundred articles), but suffice it to say that Blizzard has applied their usual polish and class to this event. Knowing the massive undertaking required to put on an SOE FanFaire, I am stunned by the effort it took to pull off BlizzCon. In ways it reminded me of the excitement and energy of the E3 of old, without most of the excess and eventual decadence.</p>
<p>After standing in line about a half hour I even got to play Diablo 3, and let me assure you that it rocks.</p>
<p>I must admit, the frenzy of BlizzCon and the launch of the 3.0 patch has me in a quandary as to whether I should return to WoW now or wait for Wrath in a month. I&#8217;d like a little time to get to know my class again (since they basically rewrote the talents of just about everybody), but I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;d actually <strong><em>do </em></strong>in the game. I don&#8217;t want to roll an alt, and any gear I&#8217;d acquire on my main will be instantly obsolete in Northrend. I suppose I could try to make enough cash to finally get my epic flier, but I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s enough to keep me interested.</p>
<p>This dilemma is partly fueled by the fact that my playtime in WAR has been dragging a bit lately. After exhausting the tier 2 content in chaos, I ran through the dark elf area. I feel the quest design and populationÂ  leave a little to be desired, and I&#8217;ve found myself frustrated more often than entertained. I still find the marauder much more to my taste than WoW&#8217;s warrior, so I&#8217;m not sure what I want to do yet.</p>
<p>Hey, it&#8217;s good to have options at least!</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=346" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Innovation Is a Moving Target">Innovation Is a Moving Target</a></h2>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p><a title="He's a blog star" href="http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2008/09/why-dont-we-play-innovative-games.html" target="_blank">Tobold made a post</a> pointing out the cruel irony of gamers: they clamor for innovative new games even as they spend most of their money buying franchise titles and sequel after sequel. From a big studio perspective, where there are thousands of people on the payroll and big fancy offices to justify, it&#8217;s hard for them to take risks like small indie studios can. So what players really want to see is for indie studios to make games that go mainstream, even though they will end up despising the indie studios for their success.</p>
<p>The music industry worked much the same way (when there <em>was </em>a viable music industry, I mean). Hair metal bands dominated the charts in the late 1980s. When Nirvana released <em>Nevermind </em>in 1991, it was hardly the first record of its kind; the band built upon the foundations laid by the Meat Puppets, Sonic Youth, and dozens of other indie bands that toiled in commercial obscurity. Yet <em>Nevermind </em>signaled a paradigm shift in popular music, and suddenly alternative and grunge overthrew hair metal. Labels raced to sign every Nirvana clone they could as what had been seen as innovative became mainstream. Of course there was nerd rage backlash against Nirvana for selling out, but that comes with the territory for any indie darling that hits the big time.</p>
<p>The same thing will happen with MMOGs. Some small studio will eventually release a product that is seen as a breath of fresh air from what has gone before and will be accessible enough to strike commercial gold. Dozens of companies will attempt to duplicate its success by releasing similar games. And the nerd rage will target the original game as being mainstream corporate blandness while the masses demand something else new and innovative.</p>
<p>So to sum up this analogy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultima Online is the Meat Puppets</li>
<li>EverQuest is Sonic Youth</li>
<li>World of Warcraft is Nirvana&#8217;s <em>Nevermind</em></li>
<li>Warhammer Online is <a title="Everything Zen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_(band)" target="_blank">Bush</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, WAR doesn&#8217;t merit such cruelty, but you get the idea. (Sorry, Paul.)</p>
<p>From a consumer perspective, innovation comes with a price tag: slogging through many near-misses before something surfaces that is both innovative and appealing to a mass audience. And almost as soon as it happens, that once-innovative product gets passed over by those looking for the next big thing.</p>

					<p><a title="You can't make this stuff up" href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/09/world-of-warcra.html" target="_blank">Wired is reporting</a> that a professor at the National Defense University (am I the only one who didn&#8217;t know there even <em>was </em>a National Defense University?) gave a <a title="Seriously. NOT MADE UP." href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/files/OSC-TOAVS.ppt" target="_blank">presentation</a> on virtual worlds which included a fictional scenario of how terrorists might use the raid lingo of World of Warcraft to disguise a plot to blow up the White House.</p>
<p>I am nearly baffled beyond words.</p>
<p>Who in their RIGHT FRAKKING MIND would assume that terrorists would go to the trouble of disguising their work in some elaborate code within WoW&#8217;s chat system when they have things like&#8211;oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8211;cellular phones and text messages? What moron would think that fighting NPCs in a DIKU game is *ANYTHING* like blowing up people in real life? How detached from reality would you even have to be to consider this even remotely likely?</p>
<p>Okay, I&#8217;ll grant you that if, while nosing around in Second Life, you notice that someone has built a scale replica of Washington and is testing ways to blow it up, it&#8217;s worth looking into. But I can guarantee you that Osama Bin Laden has not avoided capture because he&#8217;s in his mom&#8217;s basement farming boar skins in Hellfire. I&#8217;m shocked that there isn&#8217;t a slide in this presentation insisting that Chinese gold farmers are just a cover for military strategists plotting a full-scale invasion of the US.</p>
<p>The best part is that WE PAID FOR THIS. With actual tax dollars. If I can find any upside, it&#8217;s that it may be possible to write off my WoW subscription by noting on my tax return that it&#8217;s being used in the War on Terror.</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;ve got to get back to monitoring the trade channel in Ogrimmar. WE CAN&#8217;T LET THE TERRORISTS WIN!</p>

					<p>Cuppy <a title="She likes the ponies" href="http://www.cuppycake.org/?p=447" target="_blank">posted some thoughts</a> on the <a title="It's WAR, after all" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/09/08/smashmouth/" target="_blank">recent debate</a> concerning whether or not Mythic&#8217;s Mark Jacobs should have posted the response he did to the <a title="Scene of the crime" href="http://onlinegamesareanichemarket.wordpress.com/2008/09/08/oh-what-a-night-late-on-sunday-back-in-008/" target="_blank">EU beta issues on his blog</a>. Her points are correct and reasonable, and I agree with them in spirit just as I do with <a title="Hell yeah!" href="http://brokentoys.org/2008/09/08/smashmouth/#comment-38625" target="_blank">Amber&#8217;s rant </a>in the comments section.</p>
<p>However, in many cases the realities of community management are different from the ideals of it. The simple fact is that CEOs and execs get to say what they want whenever they want, and community managers just have to deal with it.</p>
<p>Believe me, it makes any CM crazy when he or she spends hours slaving over the exact wording of a post on a touchy subject only to have an Unstoppable Force leap onto the forums and drop a bomb that stirs up a hornets nest. It&#8217;s especially frustrating when you know that, no matter how well-intentioned the post was, the Unstoppable Force will only be personally engaged with the subject in question until he tires of it, at which point it becomes entirely the community manager&#8217;s mess to clean up.</p>
<p>(You might be assuming that I have found myself in such situations in the past. Perhaps this is true; I refuse to name names. Instead, we&#8217;ll just use hypothetical initials for this fictitious Unstoppable Force. Let&#8217;s randomly choose the initials &#8220;JS.&#8221;)</p>
<p>When it&#8217;s a fellow team member or even a producer who makes a post you wish they wouldn&#8217;t have, you can (and should) call them on it and try to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again. When it&#8217;s someone way up the food chain that does it, you should still call them on it. But be prepared for the fact that, no matter how positively they respond to your feedback, nothing will stop them from doing the same thing again.</p>
<p>This is the reality in this age where it&#8217;s easy for anyone to post their thoughts directly to the player base. Part of the job of the community manager is to remind the Unstoppable Force of the consequences of his posts, even if it doesn&#8217;t seem to do any good at the time. Eventually, you hope, something will sink in.</p>
<p>But the would-be community manager should have no illusions; this WILL happen to you, and you&#8217;re being paid to deal with it. You&#8217;re only in control until someone higher up the food chain swoops in and poops all over your picnic. It is in no small part how you deal with such situations that defines how well you do your job.</p>
