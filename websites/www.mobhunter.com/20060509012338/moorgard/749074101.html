Myself and Skrip have thought long and hard recently about the future of GameZNet and where we want to go with it. When it was all said and done we have decided that we will begin accepting offers on the GameZNet Network and that we will be moving on to greener pastures.<p>The ad market has suffered through a lot this year, yet we have somehow been able to churn a profit in every month but one this year. In the end it's not really a financial decision for us here, but a decision based on our need to seek new challenges and to have the ability to dedicate ourselves 100% to our new fields.<p>As a result we will be selling GameZNet to the highest bidder. This includes all Above and Beyond Technologies owned web sites. That includes popular web sites such as EQ'Lizer, Consoleparty, TA Universe, Unit Universe, GameZView, GameZCheat, MMO.GameZNet, Camelot Guild, etc. It also includes domain names we have been sitting on such as GamesPimp, GameZPimp, PSXers, GameZPortal, SovereignUniverse and others. Our network of web sites has served a minimum of six million ads every month since June of 1999.</B><p>Wow. It's been a rather tough time for EQ Web browsers everywhere. <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/">Allakhazam</a> began offering some of its services for a fee. Lum the Mad announced its upcoming <a href= http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=1992970300">departure/transformation</a>. And now there's the intention of our beloved EQ'Lizer to change hands.<p>If you need a scapegoat, blame the downfall of the dot-com phenomenon, because we all know that EverQuest--and the gaming industry in general--is more vital than ever. When the previous mana-from-heaven cashflow that ad banners once generated went down the tubes, lots of sites went down with it. The survivors, it seems, have had to make some hard choices.<p>Where does that leave Mobhunter, you ask? Well, we don't have plans to bid on GameZNet, if that's what you're wondering--unless they'd accept a trade for items on the Xev server, in which case we can set them up with a full set of bronze and maybe a yak or two--although the thought of changing our site name to <B>GameZPimp</B> does have a certain visceral <a href="http://www.victoriassecret.com/">appeal</a>.<p>Seriously now... Mobhunter is just a little tyke at this point, but our bandwidth needs keep growing all the time. We don't run any banner ads, and barely promote the links we stick into our stories through which you can order games and such. But at some point we're going to need to make the site pay for itself at least in part, especially if readership continues to grow.<p>But in any case, you won't be seeing Mobhunter up for sale at any time in the future. Any staff of <a href="http://www.threestooges.com/photos/index.htm">goofballs</a> could make a site just like it, so why would anyone bother to buy us, anyway?
