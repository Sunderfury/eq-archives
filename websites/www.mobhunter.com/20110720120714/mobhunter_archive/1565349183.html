Your corpse will be around for 7 days, but being online accelerates the timer. So you could actually be online for 12 hours and offline for 3.5 days and your corpse will go bye-bye. So don't do that.<p>I could report a bit of <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000304.html">Sullon Zek news</a>, but I won't, because SZ gets entirely too much attention.<p>Well, okay, I give in. Absor said he isn't going to reveal how Verant determines which team controls a zone, for fear that the wannabe l33t will cheat in some way to swing the balance to their team. And he's right.<p>Sorry, this isn't much of a roundup. But it's the weekend, so you get to relax, have a <a href="http://www.siscom.net/~zipp/Beer.jpg">drink</a>, and enjoy the return of one of the great <a href="http://www.nfl.com/schedules/">treasures</a> our society has to offer.
