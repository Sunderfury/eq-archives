					<p>I recently bought the first season of Star Trek (The Original Series, of course) on Blu-Ray. It&#8217;s very cool, because you can switch between watching the episodes with the original special effects or the nicely redone versions they syndicated a couple years back. Unlike most revisions to classic shows, the updated effects took nothing away from the episodes and were handled very tastefully.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy a lot of series on DVD, but the original Trek is definitely worth the purchase. This spiffy set makes me wish another of my favorite science fiction shows would receive the same treatment: Babylon 5.</p>
<p>B5 is perhaps the best written show of its kind, groundbreaking in that it was plotted out as a complete story intended to run five seasons. Its themes and characters hold up exceptionally well, but its special effects look horribly dated. If it&#8217;s hard for me, a die-hard fan, to stomach the ancient Amiga-era CGI, it would no doubt be tough for a modern audience used to the glorious effects of Battlestar Galactica to get past them.</p>
<p>Releasing a remastered Blu-Ray and DVD of Babylon 5 with new CGI would allow the show to stand the test of time and catch on with a new audience. Is it likely to happen? Who knows. Though the show always struggled in the ratings, it has sold extremely well on DVD and prompted Warner Brothers to fund further TV movies and DVD projects (including a couple attempts at follow-up shows). In fact, Warners keeps flirting with the idea of a theatrical film, though it&#8217;s still uncertain as to whether it will happen. If B5 does make it to the big screen, reviving the franchise with a remastered DVD set would be a natural promotion for a movie.</p>
<p>So while I won&#8217;t hold my breath for B5 being revamped, I can look forward to seasons 2 and 3 (yes, even 3) of Trek to grace my LCD screen. And that&#8217;s not a bad thing at all.</p>

					<p>I get emotional over Star Trek.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, our fuzzy old TV could catch about six stations: the three networks, PBS, a local independent, and maybe a UHF channel or two. Although the local station ran blocks of monster/horror movies on the weekends, there wasn&#8217;t much else on the airwaves for a skinny nerd to call his own.</p>
<p>The glorious exception was reruns of Trek&#8211;The Original Series, which at the time was The Only Series. I devoured those episodes, watching them again and again. I cried every time Captain Kirk had to let Edith die in order to save the timeline, and cheered every time he beat the Gorn. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and all the rest were a lifeline to me. No other fictional world before or since has had such a profound impact on my life, shaping my imagination and giving me an ideal to strive for.</p>
<p>When I was older I embraced the movies, TNG, DS9, and to a lesser extent the other shows. Though there was plenty of mediocre moments in those hundreds of hours of Trek, there were also some profoundly moving experiences. No matter how many times I&#8217;ve seen The Wrath of Khan, those scenes between Kirk and Spock leave me a blubbering mess. Shatner&#8217;s acting takes plenty of well-deserved knocks, but when he chokes on his words as he eulogizes Spock, I think it&#8217;s one of the most touching moments on film.</p>
<p>So when I heard plans to relaunch the franchise with a new cast taking on the classic roles of the original Trek, I was more than skeptical.</p>
<p>Happily, my fears were put to rest in the first five minutes of the film. It&#8217;s wonderful; go see it. It&#8217;s not just a great Trek film (possibly&#8230; <em>possibly</em>&#8230; the best of them all), it&#8217;s a great movie. I loved it.</p>

					<p>I hate saying it as much as you hate me for saying it, but it&#8217;s true. In what should be the best of its seasons, Battlestar Galactica&#8217;s final batch of episodes has been mostly dreadful.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t complain so much were it not for another show that is making its peers pale in comparison. The show you should be watching: Lost.</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There are two kinds of people in the world: Letterman people and Leno people.</p>
<p>Jay Leno is a funny guy, and he has bits that make me chuckle, but I mourn where he&#8217;s taken <em>The Tonight Show</em> from what it once was. This television tradition now feels like a bowl of bland jello, and it remains to be seen if Conan O&#8217;Brien will be able to restore any of its former glory.</p>
<p>David Letterman, to me, is the heir to the great lineage of talk show tradition. It&#8217;s ironic, because in his NBC days he was seen as the reckless young agitator, but today he is the elder statesman. Though he&#8217;s taken on a more conventional role in some ways, he&#8217;s now in a position where he doesn&#8217;t have to care what other people say or do.</p>
<p>If you need any evidence that Letterman is at the top of his game, witness the train wreck that was last night&#8217;s interview with Joaquin Phoenix. In one of the most bizarre and uncomfortable moments ever seen on television, you can observe Letterman at the beginning of the interview almost debating whether or not to swoop in for the kill on this actor who is obviously just completely gone. It doesn&#8217;t take Dave long to decide, what the hell, I&#8217;m going for it.</p>
<p>Check out the full interview below, and <a title="The Glover clip is still a classic" href="http://weblogs.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/blog/2009/02/letterman_joaquin_phoenix_wors.html" target="_blank">this page</a> has other great moments from Letterman&#8217;s past that have him serving as ringmaster for some mind-bogglingly odd television moments.</p>

					<p>It saddened me not a little this week to read that <a title="A piece of history" href="http://www.startrekexp.com/" target="_blank">Star Trek the Experience</a>, a museum/theme ride that has been in the Las Vegas Hilton for over a decade, <a title="Boldly going into retirement" href="http://trekmovie.com/2008/06/29/star-trek-the-experience-closing-in-september/" target="_blank">will be closing this September</a>.</p>
<p>I am sorry to see it go, not only because I am a lifelong Trek fan (however dated some of the multimedia stuff was, the collection of memorabilia was first rate) but because of the countless Fanfaire memories forever associated with the place. I&#8217;ve attended many SOE gatherings at the Hilton, and Quark&#8217;s Bar was always the epicenter where fans and devs could hang out together. Many a <a title="Don't believe what the page says--one person can drink this!" href="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Warp_core_breach_(beverage)" target="_blank">Warp Core Breach</a> has been consumed while discussing the latest patch or sharing war stories of a raid gone wrong.</p>
<p>There are hints that the Experience may be reopened elsewhere. Certainly if the <a title="Click the red dot for some kind of ARG" href="http://www.startrekmovie.com/" target="_blank">franchise relaunch film</a> is a hit, you can expect to see all kinds of updated Trek in the media. But for us diehards, the original STE will be remembered fondly as a Mecca to which we could make our nerd pilgrimage, a place where we could share our fandom and not feel so alone in the galaxy. It was a place of hope and dreams, and we need more of those in this life, not fewer of them.</p>

					<p>Thankfully, David Cook won American Idol. After last night&#8217;s all-out performance by Archie, I was resigned to seeing the younger David winning the year. Perhaps Simon&#8217;s harsh comments actually motivated more viewers to come out on behalf of Mr. Cook. In any case, the right man won.</p>
<p>When I saw the finale was going to be two hours long, I had no intention of watching anything except the last 15 minutes. Of course, I ended up watching the whole thing, and it was actually enjoyable. It was nice to see members of the top twelve who hadn&#8217;t been around in a while, and most of the &#8220;star&#8221; appearances were tasteful.</p>
<p>But come on, be honest: Does anyone actually think that Mike Myers movie looks at all funny? The trailers are painful to watch.</p>
<p>That aside, tonight was the culmination of a good season. I&#8217;ll be back next year.</p>
<p>Now the summer season starts with tomorrow night&#8217;s kickoff of So You Think You Can Dance, which is actually one of my favorite reality shows.</p>
<p>Yeah, I watch too much TV. Hope my copy of Age of Conan gets here soon.</p>
