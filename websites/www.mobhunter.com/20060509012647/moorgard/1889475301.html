I really, really did.<p>But the road trip from Minneapolis to the Sunshine State did not appeal to Kohath and Csenicier. They cited concepts like &quot;practicality&quot; and &quot;fiscal responsibility&quot; as reasons not to drive down. My best attempts to convince them otherwise failed, so we are stuck here amidst the cooling winds of autumn. Bleh.<p>A big /rude to Kohath and Csenicier. I wish I was at FanFaire!<p>Anyway, Absor will be there, as will most of the Verant staff.<br>/rude Verant staff! /envy Verant staff!<p>You'd think that before he left, Absor would have dropped some juicy news on us--something we could chew on for a few days. No such luck, unfortunately.<p>Here's some horse crap, most of which you probably knew already:<p><B>Most likely horses will not be allowed to function indoors. There are just too many situations that could make problematic for horses indoors, not the least of which might be stuffing the rider into the roof of a low ceiling. They will probably disappear when you zone into an indoor location.<p>When you die the horse will probably disappear. He will also probably disappear when you dismount, but you will indeed be able to dismount. You'll be able to 'call' your horse back when you need it (which will also cause you to mount the horse).<br>. . .<br>If you purchase Shadows of Luclin then you will be able to ride your horse in any outdoor zone, old world or new. However, those that do not have Luclin and all the new graphics it includes (as well as those that own Shadows of Luclin but choose to disable the new graphics) will not see your horse. Only those using the new expansion will be able to see horses.<br>. . .<br>Oh! I also wanted to respond to those that had thought that the horses in some of the earlier screen shots looked a little odd. We had noticed that and had fixed them up just about the time that those shots came out (remember, print magazines have to get these shots a while before the magazine hits the stands). I'm sure you'll be seeing more horse shots before too long, and you'll be able to see the difference.</B><p>Wow, that's as much about horses as I ever wanted to know. More, even. Having horses as outdoor-only makes all kinds of sense... though it would have been cool for someone like me to be blocking the zoneline in SolB for a change, instead of some fat troll or ogre.<p>Hey, Verant wants you to fill out a survey, and they're giving away a free year of EQ to tempt folks to respond:<p><B>Want to have a chance to play EverQuest for a full year without spending a single penny for subscription?

Wish us luck!<p>And once again...<p>/rude Kohath &amp; Csenicier
