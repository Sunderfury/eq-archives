<html><head><title>The Randy Ratio</title></head><body><h1>The Randy Ratio</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-09-15</p><BIG>65 Love Affair</BIG><p>Perhaps because of all the attention from the various EQ news sites and message boards, the Planes of Power dev team has come clean in a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=51678">design update</a> and confirmed that the level cap will indeed be going up to 65 with the PoP expansion. Let's take a look at some of the major points that this letter raises:<p><B>The level cap will increase to 65.  Those levels will have inherent benefits much like previous levels.  However, they will not be exactly the same.  The rate of advancement in character levels is designed to feel more natural and not take the punishing time commitment required between 51 and 60.  We understand the frustration that painfully long levels can cause, and hope not to repeat that experience for players.  This, combined with the new bonuses for fighting higher level opponents, should make leveling seem less like something that you have to do and more like something that just happens as you play.</B><p>This seems to be saying that levels 61-65 won't take as much experience to get through as anything from 51 to 60. At first glance this seems unlikely, but there might be a good reason for it. More on this later.<p><B>Level advancement is closely tied to Planar Advancement.  The systems compliment each other.  Planar advancement includes extensions on the Alternate Advancement system, along with new abilities for all classes.  Advancing your character is a combination of traditional leveling and advancement through planar abilities.  Players who enjoy pure leveling can do so, and people that prefer a combination of level advancement and investment in specific abilities can do that as well.</B><p>What's not clear is whether Planar Advancement experience (PAXP from here on in) will be part of AAXP or a separate number entirely. That is, will players choose whether their exp goes to regular exp, AAXP, or PAXP?<p><B>Many of the game balancing and system changes you've seen in Live EverQuest over the last few months have been done with this future advancement in mind.</B><p>What changes? I'm betting the resist system, for one. We all know that until the recent change, levels had a far greater impact on whether you resisted a spell than your actual resist number did. In order to ensure that level 65 players weren't suddenly immune to all kinds of boss mobs, the whole resistance system had to be changed.<p>This is why I think levels 61-65 will be faster to get through than anything from 51-60--they simply won't be as meaningful. Levels 51-60 saw a massive increase in player skill caps, improved resistances, disciplines, and other things that utterly ruined the balance of the game. I'm betting that levels 61-65 will give us more hitpoints, minor increases in each class's innate resistances, and access to the new Planar skills, but other than that won't impact game balance much. As such, levels 61-65 won't be &quot;worth&quot; as much, in that they won't alter your game significantly. If all these points are true, then I will reluctantly admit that additional levels won't be so bad.<p><B>Expect to see more balancing that allows us to once again develop high end content that does not involve marathon battles that are more about attendance and endurance than tactics and skill</B><p>The wording there is a bit awkward, but I'll take tactics and skill over zerging any day of the week.<p><B>We are very aware of the issues that players are not enjoying in current gameplay and some of the mechanics introduced with other expansions.  We plan to avoid contrived &quot;timesinks&quot;, so that you'll be playing rather than just spending time.  This is not to say that success in Planes of Power doesn't require some time, we just want it to be time that you can enjoy.</B><p>This statement, above all others in the letter, has high-end players skeptical. Luclin has <I>major</I> timesinks, devised--in the opinion of most people--to cover up for an expansion that was largely unfinished when it shipped. Most of us will believe it when we see it.<p>Overall, I guess the letter does make me feel a bit better about the level cap thing. The levels seem--so far, at least--to be more of a bone to players who want somewhere to go, without the feeling you had when Kunark was released that you absolutely <I>had</I> to get those new levels just as soon as you could.<p>The biggest concern, I think, is that as you go from 61-65 the experience boost you get from fighting harder mobs will shrink and shrink, effectively making it harder to get those last levels. The best-equipped players will continue to seek out the harder exp camps (Ssra Temple, CT) and will level faster, while players with lesser equipment will have to struggle at Velks and FG.<p>For now, we'll continue with a cautious &quot;we'll see&quot; perspective on the whole levels thing.<p><BIG>But the Server Select Screen Is So Fun...</BIG><p>Did you notice the patch program downloading a few new files the other day? Turns out they're part of a fix (we hope) for the nefarious zonecrash problems that players have experienced for ages when entering places like Great Divide, Shadowhaven, and Dawnshroud. Absor stopped by Graffe's Wizard board to <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=20532.topic&amp;start=72&amp;stop=72">explain</a>:<p><B>Oddly enough, the light went on when some PoP testers that somehow managed to say the right things that made the problem clear. One of those weird bugs that someone had to point at while standing on their heads and wiggling thier toes to make appear.<p>It was a problem with sound, a combination of a meaningless invisible bug in the sound code and a spelling error on a few sound files.<p>/em shurg<p>Obviously this might not completely fix the problem, but we think it should nail the majority of it.</B><p>Our collective fingers are crossed. Who hasn't cursed at an unexpected layover in Great Divide?<p><BIG>How Do You Say I Love You to an Answering Machine?</BIG><p>Once upon a time there was a lonely emperor in a temple. Though he was a snake, he longed for someone to love.<p>At the same time, in a clean white city, there was an uptight high inquisitor who longed for romance. And yet, he too was forced to live his life alone.<p>Then came the one day when this snakey met this fellow, and they knew that it was much more than a hunch; that this group must somehow form a... aww, to hell with it.<p>If you happened to be looking to kill the Emperor in Ssra or Lord Seru, <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=383909f7a256c2427349c20020d30ea9&amp;threadid=2867">you're out of luck</a>. Since the recent resist changes made them magic slowable, Verant has apparently been keeping both mobs on ice via GMs popping in and killing them. Presumably the big bads will return once they have been properly tuned and are no longer in danger of being gimped.<p>Still, it makes for a nice story... a big snake and Hitler's twin running off to a hidden love nest somewhere. Who says romance is dead?<p><B>*** UPDATE: Ssra Temple and Sanctus Seru zones went down tonight (9/16) for an update. Could the bosses be back? Go kill Blood or check on Seru and let me know! ***</B><p><BIG>Atlas Shrugged</BIG><p>Besides posting a new <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/jaggedpineforest.html">map of Jaggedpine Forest</a>, Muse at EQ Atlas recently made available a new UI mod tool called the <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/gui/">GUI XML Creator</a>. It changes your help window into something useful--it lets you display .jpeg images in game.<p>Sure, you could use this to view maps while playing, but I prefer to use it to look at por--um, family photos. Really. Honest.<p><BIG>The New King of Video Cards?</BIG><p>Remember when there used to be like a dozen video cards on the market at any one time? I don't mean like today, where there are different versions of essentially the same card; I mean like Diamond had a couple, ATI had a few, Matrox had several, 3dfx had their line, and many other companies had competing chipsets. Nowadays the market has shrunk to only a few different chipsets, with nVidia being the king for a while now.<p>But now ATI is back with the latest in their Radeon line, the 9700. Those of you who drool over <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1683">benchmarks</a> will be anxious to get one, but how does the card fair in EQ?<p>So far, <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=20518.topic">preliminary reports</a> are promising. People with 2gHz+ CPUs are reporting things like being in the Bazaar with all options on and no noticable lag. That's pretty amazing.<p>Should you upgrade? Well, I still think that EQ's performance is tied to a combination of both CPU and video card. Sticking the 9700 in an older system isn't going to do you much good, just as running an old TNT card on a speedy CPU isn't a good match. Find the best combination of motherboard, CPU, and video card in your price range, stick a ridiculous amount of RAM onboard, and you'll probably be happy.<p>Of course, there are some people who always buy the best new video card as soon as it comes out, so those folks probably have one already. If you've got a GeForce 3 or better, the difference probably isn't worth the $350 price tag of the 9700, but someone with an older video card and an otherwise healthy system might find this a compelling choice.<p>Naturally, if anyone out there want to send me one, I'd be more than happy to give you a full report on the card's EQ performance.<p>Oh, and before I forget, does anybody have a winning NFL team that I could adopt? Please?
