				<h2><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=466" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Spam: the New Poetry">Spam: the New Poetry</a></h2>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Have you ever actually browsed your junk email folder? Sure, there&#8217;s nasty virus-laden stuff you need to watch out for, but some spammers are including a wealth of inspired writing in their messages that a student of modern poetry can&#8217;t help but find captivating.</p>
<p>Check out this gem, found in a message entitled &#8220;Restore your organs ability and productivity now&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>but let me tell you thats not how it will really go i imagine most kids will want to stay home and play computer games but their moms will make them come and so theyll grudgingly put on a some church pants and skirts so i was wondering if you could help me know how to bring the romance back into our modern life its not really that important no matter the dress or the menu we just want the kids to come to feel the spirit of the temple but its like you said anne when you dont use your imagination to make life beautiful how much you miss what an adventure it is</p></blockquote>
<p>Marvelous! This passage has a stream-of-consciousness quality to it that I admire. I knew many would-be poets at university who had no hope of matching such majesty.</p>
<p>Later in the same email, the author shifts focus to a new subject framed in the context of modern life:</p>
<blockquote><p>breakfast i always have two eggs and salsa always i dont really get sick of it and it would really stink if i did because theres not a lot out there for breakfast actually when you are at your ideal weight and ovulating regularly you can have any kind of whole grain hot cereal without a problem you know steel cut oats etc i am not quite there yet berries and grapes are pretty low on the glycemic index and i have those too oh and i love cottage cheese with fruit grant and i listened and danced to his music on valentines day</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascinating! As an audience, we are enthralled by the narrator&#8217;s candor on her eating and ovulation habits. Yet it is the hint of romance at the end of the passage which truly captivates us, leaving us to wonder as to the identity of &#8220;grant&#8221; and the mysterious composer of the music to which our protagonist danced.</p>
<p>This modern epic draws to a close with yet another slice-of-life observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>do you have to be obsessed with yarn and needles and hooks like i am to think that is the most inviting little space youve ever seen when cate is too scared to go downstairs penny will go with her and everything is all right she lets cate dress her up for weddings or try to ride her or pull her by the tail almost daily and even knowing the torture she will soon endure she gets so excited when cate gets home from school</p></blockquote>
<p>Using yarn and needles as metaphors for our fear of institutions such as weddings and school is beyond brilliant. You&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find social commentary of this caliber among today&#8217;s published so-called poets.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll realize that a wealth of reading wonder awaits in your junk folder. It is perhaps the ultimate irony that beauty and thought of this quality is being relegated to the trash bins of modern culture. The future of our society is alive and well, not within the cold walls of the classroom, but inside the nurturing womb of the spam filter.</p>

					<p>Okay, it&#8217;s not technically <em>my </em>book per se, but I did coauthor a chapter with my old (and I do mean <em>old</em>) comrade, Tracy &#8220;Owlchick&#8221; Seamster. The book is called <em>Writing for Video Game Genres: From FPS to RPG</em>, and its contributors come from the Writers SIG of the IGDA. Our chapter is, as you might guess, about writing for MMOGs. The rest of the book covers pretty much any type of video game you can imagine.</p>
<p>Obviously the focus is on writing, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about me jamming a bunch of opinionated design theories down your throat (after all, you get those for free on this blog). If for some reason you find this book appealing, you can pad my wallet with a hefty .002 cents per copy royalty by ordering the book directly <a title="Shameless plug." href="http://www.akpeters.com/product.asp?ProdCode=4179" target="_blank">from the publisher</a>, <a title="No shame at all." href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Video-Game-Genres-FPS/dp/1568814178/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1238125481&amp;sr=1-7" target="_blank">via Amazon</a>, or <a title="Seriously, I need money." href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Writing-for-Video-Game-Genres/Wendy-Despain/e/9781568814179/?itm=1" target="_blank">from Barnes &amp; Noble</a>. Word is it may even show up in your local bookstore at some point.</p>
<p>Let me warn you ahead of time that I had to hold back a bit on some of the details I would have otherwise included had my current project been on the shelves already (have to protect the secret sauce, you know), but I think the stuff Tracy and I put together is nonetheless useful for anyone thinking of becoming a writer for an MMOG.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m most proud of the fact that I now have something tangible to show my mom to explain what I do for a living. Video games she doesn&#8217;t get, but a book she will understand.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m back from NYCC and had a great time. The panel on 38 Studios went well, even though there have been a few complaints about us not talking about the game&#8211;this despite the <em>very first slide</em> and the panel intro making extremely clear that <em>we would not be talking about the game</em>. Most people attending understood what we were trying to accomplish, and our discussion of studio process and answers to the fan questions actually hinted at quite a lot of what we&#8217;re doing, if you knew what to listen for.</p>
<p>NYCC is great. It is smaller than the San Diego version, but in a good way. The crowds are still huge but you can actually make your way down the aisles reasonably well and interesting things can stand out rather than get lost in the crowd. I would recommend the show to everyone, but then NYCC will keep growing in size and soon it will be just as unruly as SDCC.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see as many costume tragedies as last year. Sure, there were a few Slave Leias that shouldn&#8217;t have left the house, but on the whole there were few attrocities. The best costume was one I saw on Sunday: a young woman bravely dressed as Poison Ivy wearing only some carefully placed leaf appliques and a flesh-colored thong. I don&#8217;t think she had an ounce of fat on her body, and needless to say she drew quite a crowd.</p>
<p>Not that I was leering, mind you.</p>

					<p>This weekend I&#8217;m headed back to the Big Apple with several 38 Studios cohorts to take part in a <a title="hells yeah" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/62128" target="_blank">panel discussion</a> at <a title="NYCC" href="http://www.nycomiccon.com/App/homepage.cfm?moduleid=2577&amp;appname=100453" target="_blank">New York Comic Con</a>. The theme of the panel is &#8220;MMO Development: Year Two.&#8221; It&#8217;s a follow-up to last year&#8217;s panel in which we talked about, uh, year one of the studio.</p>
<p>So this raises the question of exactly why we&#8217;re travelling to the heart of Yankee country when we&#8217;ve made clear that we&#8217;re not going to unveil the details of Copernicus this year. Well, first of all, Ten Ton Hammer asked us to do it and we like those guys. Second, it gives the MMOG fan a peek behind the curtains at how development works. Finally, its Comic Con! We&#8217;re geeks at heart and love to soak it all in.</p>
<p>If you happen to be attending the show and would like to say hello, our panel starts at 1:45pm on Saturday. I&#8217;ll be wearing my <a title="You know you want to see it" href="http://the-adventurers-club.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/adam_hughes_power_girl3_1.jpg" target="_blank">Power Girl</a> costume.</p>

					<p>Happy Holidays, whichever you may celebrate. I&#8217;ll go ahead and call out Christmas because, well, it&#8217;s Christmas.</p>
<p>I do plan to write about games again at some point, as soon as I can figure out something worthwhile to say. Honestly, despite some relatively big news in the latter months of this year, I can&#8217;t think of all that much to talk about that hasn&#8217;t been said already or wouldn&#8217;t be in bad taste for me to comment on.</p>
<p>Before the year is out I&#8217;ll be posting my picks for the best music of 2008. Until then, please keep me in you thoughts as I&#8217;m currently freezing my nethers off visiting my homeland of Minnesota.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m not going to tell you who to vote for. Frankly, you shouldn&#8217;t be looking for political advice on a gaming blog.</p>
<p>But this is an important election, one that will directly shape the future of the next decade. Issues will be decided in the coming years that will affect America&#8217;s economic and strategic place in the world. This is big stuff.</p>
<p>It falls upon all of us to exercise our right and make informed decisions in the upcoming election. That means looking beyond who has the smoothest soundbites or who does the more convincing job of slamming his opponent and focusing on which candidate you believe will best lead us to a prosperous future.</p>
<p>One great thing about the presidential race is that, unlike some recent elections, I think both candidates are good men who sincerely care about their country and its people. They differ greatly on how they think we should go about fixing what is broken, but neither is completely right nor completely wrong; if that were the case, there wouldn&#8217;t be so many intelligent people on both sides of the political aisle.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t leave decisions like this in someone else&#8217;s hands. Too many good people have fought and died to give us the opportunity that so many take for granted on election day. Don&#8217;t be one of those sad statistics. Invest the effort into examining the issues and taking a hard look at where you stand. Your voice only counts if you use it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be stupid. Vote.</p>

					<p>On Thursday I&#8217;m making the cross-country flight to California to attend <a title="As if they need me to pimp this event" href="http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon/?rhtml=y" target="_blank">BlizzCon 2008</a>. A couple of us from 38 Studios will be there in relation to a project called <a href="http://www.azerothadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Azeroth Advisor</a> which you may have <a href="http://www.massively.com/2008/10/03/38-studios-acquires-mmo-newsletter-tailored-to-player-characters/" target="_blank">caught wind about</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be walking the show floor, chatting with gamers and soaking in the sights. And yeah, we&#8217;ll be taking notes so that one day when we have Copernicus fan events, they will be just as exciting as BlizzCon.</p>
<p>Oh, and I want that polar bear!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again: I much prefer fan events over industry gatherings. There is no substitute for meeting players face to face&#8211;even if they&#8217;re not players of a game I&#8217;m working on. So if you see a couple geeks wandering around in 38 Studios gear, be sure to say hello.</p>

<p>Of course the <em>real </em>season begins on Monday when my beloved Vikings trounce the hapless Packers on their way to winning the Superbowl. Go Vikes!</p>
