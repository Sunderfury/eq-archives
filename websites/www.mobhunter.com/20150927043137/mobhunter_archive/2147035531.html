Once I got this news, of course, I immediately dispatched Kohath to download the buttload (his technical term) of new files needed to check it out.<p>Here's the patch message he found:<p><B> ** Monday, June 24 2002.<p>Welcome to the open beta phase of testing for EverQuest's new interface!<p>It still has a few rough edges and some pieces that aren't complete, but after using it in-house for a couple weeks, we'd like to see how well it does in front of a larger audience.<p>By now, you've downloaded all of the graphics and layout files. If you choose to run the new interface, please edit your EQCLIENT.INI file and, under the defaults section, add the line:<p>NewUI=TRUE<p>...and feel free to have a look around!<p>As always, your feedback is welcomed through the Developer's Corner.<p>* Random new toys worth checking out in the new interface:<p>- Item Inspection: Alt-Leftclick now pops up the inspect box and keeps it there.<p>- Quantity Selection: You can now type numbers when referring to stackable items and coins.<p>- Key Mapper: Every top level window still has a hotkey you can use to open and close it, and all of the keys can still be remapped through the Options screeen. (The hex nut icon in the window selector, or Alt-O by default). To turn the window selector itself on and off, the default key is Alt-W.<p>- Mousewheel: ...should automatically work in every UI screen that has a scroll bar. (including Chat, Merchants, Looting, etc.)<p>* For those interested in developing custom skins for the interface:<p>You'll notice that there is now a directory called UIFiles beneath your EverQuest install directory.<p>The default skin (aka &quot;The New UI&quot;) is stored in the directory called, predictably &quot;default,&quot; and we've included a document called &quot;AboutSIDL.doc&quot; in the UIFiles directory.<p>If you make yourself a new skin, please create a separate directory for it in the UIFiles directory. Once the skin is in there, you can switch to it by typing &quot;/loadskin <directory_name>&quot;<p>Working with the skins at this point is not an activity for the faint of heart, but if you're inclined to hack around in those files, AboutSIDL will hopefully help out a bit.<p>This one we definitely can't just sign &quot;- The EverQuest Development Team.&quot;<p>Many, many people have contributed to this effort, be it artwork, technology, or suggestions.<p>So, for now, we'll sign it this way:<p>- The EverQuest Team<br>- The Sovereign Team<br>- The SOE Platform Art Team<br>- The SOE Testing Department<br>- The SOE Game Operations Team<br>- The SOE Customer Service Department<br>- The SOE Platform Coding Team</b><p>The patch message outlines some things we'd heard about but that hadn't been shown in Verant's tour, such as the ability to type in quantities for coins and stackable items, the inspection box, and mousewheel usability.<p>Below are a few screen shots that Kohath snagged while playing around with the UI:<p><table border=0><tr><td><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/new-char-select.jpg"><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/new-char-select-small.jpg" border=0 alt="Character selection.  Click for a bigger version."></a></td><td><font class="ArticleText">Here's the new Character Select screen. Note the &quot;Explore&quot; button. It lets you walk around the room and look at your other characters. That's pretty cool. &quot;Rotate&quot; toggles the character rotation on and off.</font></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/EQ000102.jpg"><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/EQ000102-small.jpg" border=0 alt="Merchant.  Click for a bigger version."></td><td><font class="ArticleText">Here's Kohath interacting with a merchant. Note the item name when he mouses over the merchant's inventory. That's automatic--no need to click to see what the item is. Woot!</font></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/EQ000103.jpg"><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/EQ000103-small.jpg" border="0" alt="Trading.  Click for a bigger version."></a></td><td><font class="ArticleText">This is a trade window with another player. Note the way transparent windows overlap so you can still see the one below. The text in the chat window is also interesting.</font></td></tr></table><p>Kohath had a few issues with screen lag--his system is a bit anemic--but overall the results were <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/predate/index.html">encouraging</a>. The UI is just beginning to be tested, remember, so we should certainly see its performance and <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stories/1451/2928904.html">stability</a> increase before the interface goes live (which, rumor is, will be about the second week of July).<p>By all means, log on to Test and put the UI through its paces. The more player testing that happens, the stronger it will be in the long run.
