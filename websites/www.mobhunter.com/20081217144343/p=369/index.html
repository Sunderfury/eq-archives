			<div class="entry">
				<p>The BioWare Austin folks are talking a lot about Star Wars: The Old Republic. And they should, because it&#8217;s without question one of the most anticipated MMOGs on the horizon, thanks in no small part to BioWare&#8217;s reputation for making quality games.</p>
<p>Besides meditating on <a title="The Force was REALLY generous to this one" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/47423" target="_blank">the size of one&#8217;s lightsaber</a>, a major point of emphasis that the devs focus on is the role of the player as hero. For instance, the lead writer discusses <a title="That's a mighty big slug" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/10/24/the-old-republic-unveiled-leveling-sidekicking-and-questing/" target="_blank">making the player feel heroic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daniel Erickson, Lead Writer BioWare Austin:</span> The k&#8217;lor&#8217;slug is 20 feet tall, and horrible, and can eat your face &#8230; and that&#8217;s what you fight at level one as a Sith. The first thing you ever fight in the game is that thing. And you never do anything less heroic than that. There are no bunnies, no rabbits, no snakes &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>A noble goal, that of relieving players of the burden of killing all those tens of rats. This has caused many to consider the role of the hero, including <a title="Link to a lesser blog" href="http://38pitches.com/2008/10/24/mmo-design-and-development/" target="_blank">some folks I happen to know</a>. But while I agree with the general goal of making the player feel heroic, there&#8217;s a lot more to it than just the type of creatures they fight.<span id="more-369"></span></p>
<p>Players feel awesome for a variety of reasons in MMOGs. There is a distinction between making someone feel like a hero, giving them a sense of accomplishment, or making them feel like a badass.</p>
<p><strong>The Hero</strong></p>
<p>Heroes are extraordinary people who do amazing things that the average person can&#8217;t. Traditionally this has been a rather weak area in MMOGs, simply because of the very properties of the game.</p>
<p>A quest giver may beg your character to fight back the orcs that threaten his village, which seems a worthy task for a hero. But sooner or later you realize that if you don&#8217;t fight back the orcs, someone else will. Worse yet, killing a certain number of orcs may complete your quest, but the orcs just respawn and threaten the village again. in order to feel like a hero, the game needs to give consequences for your actions or the lack thereof.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario instead. The village is being overrun by orcs, and if the players don&#8217;t successfully defend the village against incursion over the course of the invasion, the villagers will be driven out and orcs take over. All of a sudden the player&#8217;s choice becomes meaningful; they can see an outcome based upon their actions or inactions, and their world is changed as a result.</p>
<p>Scenarios like this are one-time-use bits of content, and as such are usually regarded as too expensive for MMOG makers to undertake except in rare circumstances. But the games that really want to play up the role of the hero will find ways to make the investment. Without it, heroism in these games will continue to feel shallow.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplishments</strong></p>
<p>Making the player feel they accomplished something worthwhile with their time is different than making them feel like a hero, but is just as rewarding. Such moments become even more memorable if the player feels like these goals were set by themselves rather than having them dictated to them.</p>
<p>The run from Freeport to Qeynos is a good example. Nobody gave you a quest at level one to make this journey, but staring at the EverQuest world map inspired many players to make the trip. Those who survived, especially after suffering wrong turns and horrific deaths, had a story they tell with relish to this day.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; achievements like those recently introduced by WoW are cool. But they don&#8217;t compare to the adventures players undertake on their own, for no other reason than to see what happens. Game designers inspire these accomplishments by making a game world with enough depth to allow players to tell their own stories and imagine their own adventures.</p>
<p><strong>Being the Badass</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re serving a greater cause or helping your fellow man. Sometimes you just want to smash stuff in the face.</p>
<p>A surefire way to engage players is to allow them to unleash carnage. Drop them in a room full of zombies with a machine gun (or a katana, or a chainsaw) and let them go to town. Few things feel as gratifying in a video game as mowing through a sea of opponents and coming out the other end bathed in the blood of your fallen enemies.</p>
<p>This feeling can be tied to heroic acts, but doesn&#8217;t have to be. The Harclave buff in EQ2 is a great example of making the player feel like a badass. With that buff, the player cuts a swath through a dungeon teeming with group mobs that don&#8217;t stand a chance. In fact, it&#8217;s just about impossible for the player to die. People played through this Splitpaw dungeon over and over again because it felt so freaking fun.</p>
<p><strong>Balance is Key</strong></p>
<p>Storytelling is about rising and falling action. You can&#8217;t just crank the volume up to eleven and expect to sustain that buzz indefinitely. For the heroic and badass moments to have significance, you also need quieter moments of reflection to consider what you&#8217;ve accomplished.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say you need to give players boring crap to do, but MMOGs are about more than chopping up opponents non-stop. One of the great social elements of EQ was the downtime between fights, which allowed players to bullshit with one another while ramping up for the next encounter. Though EQ took downtime to extremes, the complete lack of it in other games has had a palpable effect upon the way they build lasting communities.</p>
<p>So while the goal of never giving players a less imposing nemesis than a 20-foot slug is cool, that&#8217;s certainly not the only way to inspire feelings of heroism in your player base. I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on what made you feel like a hero or a badass, or what kinds of accomplishments you felt most proud of in your MMOG career.</p>

			<p>There is nothing that makes me feel more heroic than fighting a large group of mobs and winning. The Olthoi Horde Nest in Asheron&#8217;s Call did that for me. I would be pinned into a corner by dozens of Olthoi only to end up with their bodies all over the floor and me still standing. It was great! The other times are when I decide to go somewhere for no reason. I recently made the run to Rivendell in Lord of the Rings Online at too low of a level and it is certainly an unforgettable trip.</p>

			<p>City of Heroes was great at achieving that &#8220;heroic&#8221; feeling.  Running in to a group of bad guys, cutting it close and using &#8220;inspirations&#8221; (not potions or powers or whatever, but honest to God inspiration!) to pull victory from the jaws of defeat.  The problem with City of Heroes is that is what the entire game was.  One heroic fight to the next, the story, the context, your character&#8230; nothing else really mattered.  Heroic fights, repeat.  Its the only game I ever played where I burned out from having too much excitement because there was no substance under it.</p>

			<p>I have to agree with Jason regarding city of heroes. I wouldn&#8217;t say that it made me feel heroic so much as it made me feel like I wasn&#8217;t a peon. The power curve was on a higher scale. Rarely, if ever, did you fight one thing. Far from it, it took scores of minions to take you on. I think that is a good system to build from and could work. You don&#8217;t have to be a hero but you do get that &#8220;bad ass&#8221; feel from fighting bigger/more enemies. Nobody will ever feel like a stud by killing a big rat unless you happen to be a smurf, anthropomorphic mouse, or one of the children from &#8220;Honey I Shrunk the Kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, I also agree with Steve in his opinion about what the insane reduction of downtime has done to MMOs. Lets face it, every game has gone to extremes to be &#8220;not Everquest.&#8221; Which is a shame in some ways. Most modern MMOs don&#8217;t tolerate soloing, they make sure you can be by yourself from one to cap. Not only that, the system has evolved from where soloing was possible to soloing is desirable. I love to group but frankly in Warhammer it seems to be counter productive to fast leveling. I can do more solo, which is a tragedy considering its an MMO.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m a relic of a system long since gone but I miss some of those hard features. You should -always- get better rewards in a group. Not barely so, but obviously. More experience, more loot, more money and more socializing. MMO used to mean you played with others. Now, for a lot of players, it just means you have a convenient chat channel with your friends while you solo. At least Warhammer more or less mandates it for RvR. That doesn&#8217;t change the PvE zones though.</p>
<p>And that, however, is a tangent and I apologize. It would be very hard to feel like a hero but not too bad to feel &#8220;big.&#8221;</p>

			<p>Reading this topic brought back memories from a variety of MMOG&#8217;s for me, and taking a moment to highlight the common thread to these events was not a problem. For me it has and always will be about doing things a bit different then i perceive situations to be designed. I find the fun moments of feeling both heroic and badass to be in organized chaos. A few examples that immediately came to mind:</p>
<p>Hunting in the dreadlands, but instead of finding a safe spot we chose to sit right in the middle of the traffic as well as have two pullers, a druid rooting for cc and an enchanter mezzing. This gave us non stop action, more mobs then we knew what to do with but somehow tested us and increased our skill.</p>
<p>Instead of taking the easy route and quad kitting umborus toilers in Maiden&#8217;s Eye a shaman friend would join me and we would snare pull as many as we could and dot nuke them, imagine 15 - 20 or so coming at you and having to keep track of where each of them were health/doT wise an inevitably having a few break free and having to adjust.</p>
<p>Heading into Sunken Temple before either wow expansion with just a 60 druid, 53 shaman, and 47 warlock and clearing the place.</p>
<p>Unfortunately most players I have come across are not interested in attempting these types of things as it has become all about numbers and efficiency. Why would they try somethign different when there is already &#8220;THE&#8221; place and &#8220;THE&#8221; way to get the best possible XP per hour.</p>
<p>EQ for me was about enjoying the journey, everything since has been about  the mad dash to get to the top.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Heroes are extraordinary people who do amazing things that the average person can’t.&#8221;</p>
<p>This definition is very limiting.</p>
<p>Average people doing extraordinary things makes them heroic.</p>
<p>Everyone is an ordinary human that can also do extraordinary things.</p>
<p>Given the correct opportunity everyone can be extraordinary.</p>
