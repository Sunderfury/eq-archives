		<description>Nicely put. I put a lot of love into Vanguard including running the only Asia/Pac fan sit in the early days. I built solid community7 which we took into the game in its early beta.

I still maintain that Vanguard is the best game that no one ever played.</description>

		<description>What a great tribute, Steve. Some of the things you said here really tugged at my heartstrings. Vanguard was the first game after EverQuest that I gave my heart to while it was in development. I put a lot of emotional stock into the Vision. I worked to build a thriving community for the game at Ten Ton Hammer, and was saddened when the game launched and ultimately didn&#039;t reach its potential. 

You wrote: &quot;By any objective benchmark, Vanguard was never a great game. But the love we have for MMOs isn’t about benchmarks–it’s about heart. &quot;

It really is. When an MMO and its community finds a place in some fans&#039; hearts, even when it touches only a small group of fans, I believe that MMO was, at least on some level, a success. Rest well, Telon.</description>

		<description>[...] &#160; &#8221; But the love we have for MMOs isn’t about benchmarks–it’s about heart. And the game’s promise, its potential, took hold in the hearts of a core group of fans. They loved the experience despite its flaws, and found those moments of beauty to cling to. In the end, Vanguard was about community and camaraderie, about pride in overcoming adversity together.

		<description>I can&#039;t believe I was able to find this post so many years later.  Shortly after losing Toby, my chubby, black cat, I stumbled on this story and it had told a very similar and very sad story.  I saved this story on my computer for years and I would read it from time to time.  About a year or so ago, I adopted another cat from the animal shelter and named him Max. 

Just recently, on May 02, 2014, I had to make the decision to have my cat Tio put to sleep due to an inflamed pancreas, fatty liver and a fever.  It was the hardest thing I&#039;ve done yet in my life, but this story has been there for me.

Thank you for sharing this story and your feeling, it has helped me immensely.</description>

		<description>I feel your pain. I have in the layoff seat. I have been the one that had to walk out a laid off coworker. I avoid it twice so far at the current job I love. There usually no rhyme or reason for selection it seems to me. Just so odd organic algorithm.</description>

		<description>I do hope it eventually makes it to market daylight in a pleasing way. Assuming a purchaser didn&#039;t recruit back key talent .... wouldn&#039;t the game still be looking at a 3+ year cycle to learn, assimilate, and then finalize?


I agree the court stuff as it stands is pretty awful,  but to step back from 38 Studios .... one thing that this process illustrated, the US doesn&#039;t have enough protections for employees in this kind of situation.  If a company is withholding money from an employee&#039;s paycheck for benefits, and then not paying those benefit providers ... there really needs to be a legal notification to the employees when the first payment is missed.  (I&#039;m on the fence about criminal liability for the executives choosing not to pay those bills).   It&#039;s not just 38 where this has happened, Hostess had a similar issue where the management group wasn&#039;t making pension payments, but was deducting money from paychecks for it.   That&#039;s theft from where I&#039;m sitting, plain and simple.</description>

		<description>I&#039;ll have to disagree on the GW2 questing style. I like the personal quests in GW2 but once those sort of ran out, I just felt like I was wandering from spot to spot, doing heart quests, collecting vistas or talents while waiting for an event to trigger/start.

It sounds like there was a lot to do, but it wasn&#039;t things I enjoyed for a length of time. Vista jump puzzles? Bleh. Talent/trait battles? Pretty much a stomp the NPC with all the other people there to get their trait (in the odd occasion it was more about clicking on a spot). The events, themselves, weren&#039;t all that spectacular and were pretty repetitive.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, in no way am I saying WoW questing is better - it isn&#039;t. I just don&#039;t think GW2&#039;s mechanism warrants the credit it is getting... unless you&#039;re an explorer type. It really caters well to people that like exploring.

I&#039;m still waiting for something that suites me.</description>
