The best part was:<p><B>- Non-pet NPCs will start to return items they don't care about. This will occur over time as zones are updated.</B><p>Oh, and Misty Thicket was changed a bit. Something about level 60 orcs who deathtouch and cast AoE silence, I think. Or maybe I'm exaggerating.<p>What's more significant about this patch is what <I>wasn't</I> changed:<p><B><I>What about taunt in the new cazic thule?<p>What about the complete heal bug?<p>What about the extra aggro from shaman slow?</I><p>Actually, most of that stuff has been fixed on Test. Unfortunately we weren't able to push those code changes Live this time around because of some other errors that the code would have caused. We're making some changes to the server architecture (including character files), and we didn't want any problems to crop up. So a bunch of the fixes that we've got on Test didn't get to the Live servers this time around.<p>Taunt isn't, technically, broken in Cazic. The rules for taunt in old-world zones make most of the NPCs in that zone too high level to taunt. We'll be fiddling with that rule when we get a chance to patch code.<p>The bug with complete heal was/is related to filters. I don't fully understand it, but we think we'll have that fixed the next time we get to patch code.<p>We plan to make changes to the way slow spells give agro. The plan is to return them to their old aggravating levels. But we need to gather more data before we can make the fix properly. We weren't able to get to that before the patch.<p>Alan</B><p>You can tell that on the CT taunt question, Absor <I>sooooo</I> wanted to use the phrase &quot;working as intended.&quot; You could smell it on his breath, really. But at the last minute he overcame the obsession. Well done, Alan!<p>I'm guessing the AoE knockback bug wasn't fixed either, but I was too busy cooking and consuming lasagna to make it to a raid on time to be sure. If I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will jump down my throat about it. The <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=22970.topic">complete heal bug</a> really, really needs to be fixed, though.<p>Mobhunter's own spdat file parser, Remelio Gemweaver, supplied us with a <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-68513918

">lengthy list of spell changes</a> that went in with the patch. It's too long to include here, so please follow the link.<p>Velketor's Labyrinth saw a few changes in the patch as well. Crystalline Spiders got their <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=23236.topic">nasty DoT</a> back, and a couple items were <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=24840.topic">upgraded</a>--specifically the haste gloves and the crystal spider mask. Adjust your GFay pricing accordingly, farmers.<p>Finally, monks once again win Mobhunter's &quot;Whiner of the Week&quot; award, thanks to their <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=24839.topic">childish bitching</a> over the casting time being fixed on Thurgadin quest bracers. Grats monks!!!<p><BIG>More Info on that PS2 Thing</BIG><p>Absor cornered Rod Humble, the producer of both EQ and EverQuest Online Adventures and got some more <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000540.html">details</a> from him on exactly what this EOA game is all about:<p><B><I>&quot;Is it a port?&quot;</I><br>No. The product started mid 2000 with the explicit goal of being designed from the ground up as a PS2 game. A port simply would not have worked. Adventures is designed to be played in the living room which is a totally different environment from the study or bedroom where PC games are played. <p><I>&quot;Will I be able to visit all my favorite places?&quot;</I><br>Yes and No. EQOA is set 500 years before the original EverQuest so Antonious Bayle is not yet alive. The migration to Odus has not yet been completed and there are still Elves on Tunaria (it is not yet known as Antonica). We have built the world from scratch, you can visit many places which are familiar in EQ but don't expect them to look the same or even have the same inhabitants.... <p><I>&quot;How do I play without a keyboard?&quot;</I><br>Very easily as it happens. Last week I got to level ten around Moradhin just doing quests from the comfort of my couch. Certainly chat is a lot easier with a keyboard but not mandatory. I don't know how others will want to play but for me lying back on my couch with both feet up controller in one hand beverage in the other as my friends and I go dungeon delving is the preferred method.<p><I>&quot;Does the game have the same classes, abilities and races?&quot;</I><br>No. 500 years ago on Norrath races and classes were different (some didn't even exist yet!). While there will be familiarities there are many new spells and abilities that existed back in Norraths age of adventure. We will post more details on this in the upcoming months.<p><I>&quot;Is the EQOA the same team that works on EQ Live?&quot;</I><br>No. The Adventures team has been separate for nearly two years now working in the dark and in secret <p><I>&quot;Will I be able to transfer my own character to EQOA or see PC players from the original game?&quot;</I><br>No. Your characters wouldn't have been born yet! (Unless they were Elves possibly). The games run on totally different servers.<p><I>&quot;How many players does EQOA support?&quot;</I><br>More than the original EQ per server. Each world should support at least 3000 people simultaneously who can go wherever they want. There are no zones or restrictions on players going anywhere its quite possible to wander by hundreds of other players as you journey across Norrath.<p><I>&quot;What about Fippy????&quot;</I><br>Clan Darkpaw is alive and well in the Age of Adventure <p>Hope this helps!<p>Rod Humble<br>Executive Producer Studio 1</B><p>I haven't owned a console game since the Atari 2600, and I have no plans to break my streak by buying a PlayStation 2 or the network dohicky, but it would be cool to see this older version of Norrath. I'm a mythology buff, so even the convoluted lore of Norrath intrigues me. I'd like to see what the Desert of Ro looked like 500 years ago when it was the heart of Tunaria.<p>Maybe I can convince Kohath to buy one. I'll tell him I'm making him Mobhunter's official PS2 correspondent or something.<p><BIG>When It's Real, It Will Be Spectacular</BIG><p>Absor continued his State of the Game 3 <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000535.html">thread</a> by responding to a player who asked for screen shots of the upcoming EQ interface:<p><B>It's still too early for screen shots. We have every intention of running it on Test for a bit before it goes Live, so you'll have a chance to try it out. But it's not yet ready for public consumption.<p>We'll let you decide how it stacks up to other games. I think you'll be pleased.</B><p>I'm not even sure what I want out of this new interface, but I guess I'll know it when I see it. Sometime around Christmas of 2004 we'll all get a peek.
