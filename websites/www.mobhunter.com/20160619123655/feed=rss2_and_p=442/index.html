		<description><![CDATA[Maybe I&#039;m wrong, but to me that chart says that there&#039;s almost no correlation between SAT score and your choice musical Genre. There&#039;s also a lot of vagueness to it. &quot;Rock&quot; is mentioned as a genre and scores quite low. Lower than the rock bands.
The same applies to nearly every other genre and its representative artists. The only correlation I&#039;d dare to make based on this chart is that artists who cross genre boundaries tend to be liked slightly more by people with higher SAT scores.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey now!  I like Kelly Clarkson.  I&#039;m surprised the list doesn&#039;t go lower than 800 for SAT scores.

I have a wide array of tastes and could find a bind I like between 956 (Jazz is that low?) and 1250-ish (Counting Crows).  I like Beethoven, but definitely not something I listen to on a daily basis.  But, having said that, Weezer is my favorite band and is very close to my actual score for SATs.

I didn&#039;t see anything there for Manilow...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Music is emotional.  People should listen to the music that sounds good to them.  There&#039;s no wrong answer.

All the social cool/not-cool nonsense attached to music merely leads people to deny themselves the pleasure of listening to what they like.  It&#039;s sad.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heh.  I blew off the SAT&#039;s becuz the colleges I wanted to go to all used the ACT instead.  Still got a 1400.  As I recall it, at the time I listened to the typical &quot;Top 40&#039;s&quot; groups of the day (this was 1991).  But then again, I also enjoyed Metallica, Aerosmith, The Scorpions, Ozzie, and quite a lot of the classic rock from the 70&#039;s also.  The Stones, Jethro Tull etc.  And i also had a lot of symphonic movie score albums too.  Lotta John Williams and Hans Zimmer, some Goldsmith, even a couple of Vangelis.  Go figure.  

As far as actual classical/baroque goes:  Love Bach.  Hate Mozart.  Dont care either way about Beethoven.  Rachmaninoff&#039;s got some okay stuff.  Tchaikovsky&#039;s generally all right too.  

And if you haven&#039;t been to an Andre Rieu concert you haven&#039;t lived!  Okay, so he&#039;s mostly playing Strauss -- he still makes it fun!

Dangit!  I can&#039;t find myself on that chart!]]></description>
