				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keen (hopeless EverQuest sentimentalist that he is!) wrote up a nice piece on how <a title="He's keen, that one." href="http://www.keenandgraev.com/2015/02/19/quests-should-enable-players-to-tell-their-own-stories" target="_blank">quests should inspire player-driven stories</a>.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s dubious to hold up EQ as a model for how quests should work. While certain of them can be romanticized, long would be the parade of people who quit the game over the very Journeyman&#8217;s Boots quest he cites. And it&#8217;s just as valid to look at the orc belts and other turn-ins like it as grindy time-killers.</p>
<p>But I do agree with the spirit of what Keen is trying to say: That quests should not be the content of a game; they should be the spark for the true content, which is player interaction.</p>
<p>The original epic quests are a good example. For the most part, their execution was spotty&#8211;poorly written, relying on guessing more than logical deduction. But what they did was bring a whole cross-server community together. We were racing other servers to be the first to solve the quests, and class members from rival guilds who wouldn&#8217;t ordinarily interact were sharing leads and ideas.</p>
<p>I think the role of the content designer should be to provide compelling hooks for player storytelling. And by compelling, I mean both interesting and well-executed. Players should be drawn in by the quest and incentivized to undertake it, but the quest itself should be mere manipulation to get players interacting. It might be through cooperation, competition, or some kind of symbiotic relationship where both sides benefit in different ways.</p>
<p>I also agree that quests can, and generally should, be simple and straightforward. Designers often fall into the trap of wanting to tell a grand tale, when it&#8217;s usually much clearer and more effective to use quests to tell micro-stories that let players draw their own conclusions. Weave these together through consistency, continuity, and quality, and you can create a powerful tableau that tells a much bigger story.</p>
<p>To make those micro-stories work, you need to invest in quality worldbuilding, which I&#8217;ll talk about in a future article.</p>

<p>I do plan to write about games again at some point, as soon as I can figure out something worthwhile to say. Honestly, despite some relatively big news in the latter months of this year, I can&#8217;t think of all that much to talk about that hasn&#8217;t been said already or wouldn&#8217;t be in bad taste for me to comment on.</p>
<p>Before the year is out I&#8217;ll be posting my picks for the best music of 2008. Until then, please keep me in you thoughts as I&#8217;m currently freezing my nethers off visiting my homeland of Minnesota.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most of the time since I accepted the EQ2 community manager position at SOE, my old Mobhunter site has been in the capable hands of <a title="See Mike's smiling face" href="http://www.mikeshea.net/" target="_blank">Mike Shea</a>, a.k.a. <a title="That's a lot of writing!" href="http://mikeshea.net/loral/" target="_self">Loral Ciriclight</a>. Mike did a fantastic job keeping the spirit of the site alive, and over the years helped inspire many positive changes to good old EverQuest.</p>
<p>Recent changes to his life and gaming habits have caused Mr. Shea to decide that it&#8217;s time for him to <a title="/wave Loral" href="http://mobhunter.com/001569.html" target="_blank">step down as the writer for Mobhunter</a>. Mike will continue to write for his own site, so his fans should be sure to bookmark the address noted above. I&#8217;d like to personally thank Mike for his dedication and great work over the years. It always filled me with pride that the Mobhunter tradition continued on long after I was gone. (You can fumble through both my and Loral&#8217;s articles on the new <a title="Linked at the top of this page" href="http://www.moorgard.com/?page_id=284" target="_self">Mobhunter Archives page</a>).</p>
<p>Rather than turn the old site over to another writer or let the domain drift away into the nether, I&#8217;ve decided to take up the Mobhunter mantle for this blog. Moorgard.com is being re-branded as Mobhunter, which will become the primary domain in about a week. I have to admit, even though it&#8217;s just a cosmetic change, I&#8217;m very excited about writing under the Mobhunter banner once again!<span id="more-301"></span></p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m going back in time or anything. Just as Mobhunter evolved under Mike&#8217;s direction, my writing isn&#8217;t going to instantly return to my old style. I&#8217;m older now, and not quite as much of a pain in the ass as I used to be (my coworkers and wife may well disagree). Though I look back on my original articles with a great deal of fondness, I also recognize how presumptive I was about many things and how little I actually knew about making games.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more seasoned now, and I mean that will all the same connotations Commander Riker hated when Troi applied the word to him in &#8220;<a title="One of the best episodes" href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/The_Best_of_Both_Worlds_(episode)" target="_blank">The Best of Both Worlds</a>.&#8221; But the fact is, I&#8217;m just a different person than I was seven years ago when the original Mobhunter first saw the light of day. And besides, having passed through the looking glass into game development, it would be disingenuous of me to try to sound like I did all those years ago&#8211;though I do sometimes miss the shouting matches with Furor.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope folks indulge me in my return to Mobhunter, even if it&#8217;s just a slightly different twist on my home for the last several years, Moorgard.com. It&#8217;s like slipping on a favorite old coat that I haven&#8217;t worn in a long time.</p>
<p>That musty smell? Yeah, it&#8217;s me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me preface this by saying I am a huge Joss Whedon fan. I think he&#8217;s one of the best character/dialogue writers in the business, and I have admired his work since the first days of <em>Buffy</em>. He&#8217;s also a great comic book author, bringing back Buffy and Angel, breathing new life into the X-Men, and much more.</p>
<p>So I was very interested when I heard about his plans to launch a web-only musical extravaganza called <a title="You really can sing along." href="http://www.drhorrible.com/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Horrible&#8217;s Sing-Along Blog</a>. I must admit, though, I was a bit put off as the hype started to build. There was a bit of a <em>Snakes on a Plane</em> vibe to the whole thing, with even non-browncoats talking about how great it was going to be.</p>
<p>Released last week, the three episodes featured a great cast, catchy songs, and some big laughs&#8211;but I think the ending totally missed the mark. Spoilers after the break.<span id="more-245"></span></p>
<p>A funny dick joke in episode two couldn&#8217;t make up for that downer of an ending. Look, this was supposed to be a cute and funny web musical. The shtick was to parody superheroes in the style of old movie serials. It&#8217;s a solid premise, so long as the hero (who is, in this case, the villain) gets the girl.</p>
<p>Instead, we end up with the villain (who is, in this case, the superhero) in therapy, the girl dead, and the hero becoming a really nasty (if depressed) villain. What the hell?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for playing with convention, but in this case it didn&#8217;t make sense to do so. Instead of silly, we got bonafide Shakespearean tragedy. That&#8217;s cool in a deeper show like <em>Buffy </em>or <em>Angel</em>, but it ruined what could have been a clever hoot. There could have been plenty of other ways to shake up the formula without taking away the core likability of the main character.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure plenty of Whedonites will disagree with me, but in this case I think Joss missed the mark.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Iron Man</em> is pretty much everything you&#8217;d want in a superhero movie. Great action, cool hero, hot babe, and really smart humor that doesn&#8217;t get stupid or campy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not perfect, but most people will be able to look past the script&#8217;s logical flaws thanks to the sheer amount of fun eye candy the movie provides. It ranks right up there with <em>Spider-Man 2</em> in terms of great translations of comic book characters to film.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been all that fond of Tony Stark, but Robert Downey Jr. changes all that. You can&#8217;t help but like him, even when he&#8217;s being a self-involved prick. Favreau did an awesome job with this movie and better damn well come back to direct the sequel. Clearly this film was made by a true fan, packed with smart inside references that would make any geek smile.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, DON&#8217;T LEAVE THE THEATER UNTIL THE CREDITS ARE DONE! Great cameo at the end which sets up the future of Marvel moviedom.</p>
