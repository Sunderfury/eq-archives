<html><head><title>News Ahoy!</title></head><body><h1>News Ahoy!</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-02-20</p><BIG>Legends of the Caribbean</BIG><p>Over at Graffe's, wizards are <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=13088.topic">stewing</a> over an announcment about a new zone that's on its way. The backstory involves evil undead pirates, a besieged Freeport, lost treasure, and a new zone (complete with boss mob) called Marauder's Mire. Sounds pretty neat.<p>So why are the wizards so worked up? This fresh new zone with high-level content is for the Legends (Stormhammer) server--not yours or mine.  This Legends-only event is slated to set sail this Friday, February 22nd.<p>This is sure to add fuel to the still-burning fire of controversy surrounding the announcement of the Legends Server. At the time of the concept's introduction, it was promised that new content would first be put in play for those willing to shell out an extra monthly fee.  But a whole new zone with a cool backstory, new quests to be solved, and a besieged city to protect--this leaves some of the more plebian subscribers feeling shortchanged.<p>The question still remains, however, if this new content would ever have appeared at all if it wasn't for the Legends server.  Could the cost of developing this new content have been justified on the much smaller profit margins that the other servers yield? It's impossible to say.  In any case, once this content moves to all live servers--and we hope it will--we all benefit.  Plus, I'll finally get to dress up like a pirate.<p><BIG>&quot;Hello, is this Vulak's? I'd like a reservation for 50, please.&quot;</BIG><p>With the debut of Stormhammer almost upon us, and Lead GM Bordael <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000493.html">answered</a> an interesting question about the calendar that both GMs and players can use to post events. Someone asked whether player-made reservations for certain zones/mobs would be honored on the new server:<p><B>In the past EverQuest Customer Service did not recognize player created web calendars for spawn contention resolution... Given that the Legends service Calendar of Events is a single source, monitored and approved by EverQuest Customer Service, it will be a legitimate factor for the resolution of altercations. However, it will not be the only factor... Such factors could include the ability of the force present to tackle their scheduled target, the current and past conduct of the players or guilds involved in the dispute as well as any record listed on the Calendar of Events. As with any resolution, we will look to find one that is fair, unbiased and mutually equitable to all parties involved. A lofty goal, but one that we hope, with the help and cooperation of the players, to attain...<p>The Calendar is mainly a tool to inform players of events that are open for others can participate in. While notifying others of your intent to tackle a raid zone is nice, if this activity is not open to others, we may not post it. The constant monopolization of encounters will not be allowed.</B><p>That's about the only way to make the policy work, really. Very few servers ever had a reservation calendar that was tenable, with the majority of conflicts over zones or mobs ending up in either a might-makes-right contest or an attempt at GM intervention. The Legends policy at least opens the door to certain reservations, as long as the parties involved meet the requirements.<p>Hey, it's worth a shot, anyway. But our advice is that GM Bordael stock up on the Excedrin, because he may be in for a bumpy ride.<p><BIG>We've Got Questions, Big Al Has Answers</BIG><p>Not to be left out, Absor also <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000496.html">tackled</a> a field of questions. The Q &amp; A went something like this:<p><I>You promised to teach me how to pronounce &quot;Freeport.&quot;</I><p><B>I'd forgotten about that... I have a pretty long list of items to provide pronunciation for. I'll see if I can start working on it again. The hardest part is finding a way to show the pronunciation so that people can easily understand it. For the most part it takes a translator to understand the pronunciation guides in dictionaries and such...</B><p><I>Does Gorenaire have a wee-wee or a ding-dong?</I><p><B>My guess is that nobody has ever taken the time to ask these creatures their gender...</B><p><I>Could you add a separate window for my cyber? I hate to see combat spam clutter it.</I><p><B>It's certainly possible. But we'll have to wait for the new interface before we're going to look at new filters. And I don't have an estimate for the arrival of the new interface.</B><p><I>Would I get better Luclin performance if I disable Velious textures on the new models? Or should i just run around naked?</I><p><B>When you have Luclin models enabled the Velious models are not loaded, regardless of the settings for VeliousArmor=True. We do this by default to save as much memory as we can, since the Luclin models can't use the old Velious armors.</B><p><I>Where's my cape? My shoulderpads? My body piercings?</I><p><B>No new inventory slots are being displayed.</B><p><I>Why do i have to switch to a gimp screen mode to set my language?</I><p><B>This should change when we get the new interface in.</B><p><I>Why is it such a huge pain in the ass to change my text and window colors?</I><p><B>Something else that should be corrected with the new interface.</B><p>Okay, so maybe those aren't <I>exactly</I> the questions he was asked, but close enough. Can't blame us for adding a little color, can ya?<p>Absor also listened to some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000494.html">praise</a> for the Whistling Fists quest and  mentioned something about <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000495.html">beastlords</a>. Why don't we go into more detail on the beastlord thing? Because yesterday was Moorgard's day to be nice to classes, so you beastlords are a day late and a dollar short. Better be a little quicker on the draw next time!<p><BIG>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Temple</BIG><p>Looks like a new <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=26546.topic">druid spell</a> has made its way to the Test server, giving the tree huggers a pretty powerful punch. But before you get too excited, chuckle along with us as we look at the details of this spell:<p><B>Tragedy at Cazic Thule<br>Decrease Hit Points (HP) by 750 (L59)<br>Classes: Dru (L59)<br>Allowable Targets: Point Blank AoE<br>Area Effect Range: 200 feet<br>Pushes Target Back: 2 feet<br>Throws Target Up: 2 feet<br>Resistance Check: None<p>When someone casts: Soandso looks paniced as planar forces begin to tear through it's body<br>Spell cast on you: The explosive force stuns you as bits of lizard spray everywhere is slammed to the ground, covered in bits of shredded lizard<br>Spell cast on someone: Soandso is slammed to the ground, covered in bits of shredded lizard</B><p>Uh, yeah, I don't think we'll see dr00ds casting this anytime soon. It's a pretty funny joke, though. I can just picture some hot little wood elf proudly splattering her groupmates with lizard guts right before she smiles sweetly and ports away.<p>Just a little something for the spdat parsing crowd to chew on, I guess.<p><BIG>Hammer Time</BIG><p>From the Station newsletter:<p><b>Lost Quests - The Blued Steel Hammer<p>The &quot;Blued Steel Hammer&quot; is a weapon of legendary repute, but whose existence has been relegated to myth. Most people believe it is no longer in the game.  Those people are wrong!  The &quot;Blued Steel Hammer&quot; was the reward for a very old and notorious quest that could not be completed for a while. Most players have forgotten about the hammer...<p>However, the Blued Steel Hammer is out there. It is one of several items that no one has yet discovered. Or &quot;rediscovered,&quot; in this case.<p>&quot;I implemented the Blued Steel Hammer quest a long time ago, before last E3, but no one has discovered it yet,&quot; says Jeremy Ellis, designer on EverQuest. &quot;'Old school' players should recognize the name of the item and the quest it starts with, known as the 'Priestess of Najena' quest.&quot;<p>So, start questing!</b><p>It's heartening and surprising to know that there are some things left undiscovered, even after half a million people have been poking around Norrath over the last three years.  This suggests, of course, that there are other quests--likely many others--that also remain unsolved.  Either that, or the quests are simply broken.  Take your pick.<p>Original Fiery Avenger, anyone?<br>
