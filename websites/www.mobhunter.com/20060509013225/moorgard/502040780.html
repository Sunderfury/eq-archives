Thanks to the players that submitted the comprehensive list of oddities.<br>- Mind Wrack should no longer overwrite Force Shield or the Wizard Epic effect.<br>- Splurt should now stack better with most Damage over Time spells.<br>- Infectious Cloud should no longer overwrite Demi-Lich.<br>- Despair should no longer overwrite Yaulp V.<br>- Several spell particle effects should appear correctly on the target now.<br>- Several Bard songs have had their animations corrected.<br>- Grim Aura should no longer overwrite the Spiritual Brawn series.<br>- Riftwind's Protection should no longer overwrite the Augmentation series.<br>- Added new particle effects to the Gnomish Firework spells.<br>- The Psalm series of bard songs should no longer be overwritten by Elemental Chorus or Purifying Chorus.  Additionally, Psalm of Veeshan should overwrite all other lower level Psalms.<br>- Searing Flames' fire debuff has been reduced in power, but it should stack with most other debuffs now.<br>- The Malo line should no longer overwrite the druid circle series of spells.<p>** Items **<p>- Shield of the Immaculate now has a 1 second casting time.<br>- Anizok's Gauze Press should now summon 20 bandages regardless of your level.<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Aten Ha Ra now draws strength from her allies.  It may be unwise to attempt to defeat her without first killing them.<br>- Removed most of the negative stat effects from the Shaman made potions.  This should make them more useful and allow them to stack better with other magic.<br>- Added a few more keys to the player key ring for convenience.<br>- Water needed to make a Box of Souls no longer needs to be either Sacred or Holy.</B><p>There were a lot of <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Live&amp;date=2002-12-12%2011:18:45">spell changes</a>, mostly dealing with stacking issues, and some improvements to alchemy. Aside from that and a presumed fix to the exploit that allowed people to CoH directly to Aten Ha Ra, not much visibly changed.<p>Of course, a quiet surface often hides turbid waters, so post your hidden patch findings below or <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">let me know</a> what you turn up.<p><BIG>Healing Me Softly</BIG><p>Are your healers getting smushed in PoP? Well the trouble isn't as bad as the old CH aggro bug, but there do seem to be a few issues. Absor <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53193">confirmed the problem</a> on the ghost of Dev Corner:<p><B>We are aware that there is a problem with healing generating too much agro (upsetting the monsters) in Planes of Power.  We are working on a fix for this problem.  It should show up on the Test server fairly soon, but we probably will not have it ready for the patch tonight.</B><p>This really doesn't seem like a game-breaking bug, and people should be able to work around it in most situations without a lot of trouble. Maybe it's just a good reason for clerics to stop meleeing so much. They're cutting into my action anyway.<p><BIG>Beat the Giant Slowly</BIG><p>You might recall how badly slow spells were bugged a few weeks back. Instead of mobs mitigating part of the slow as intended, some of them were basically making slows worthless. Scott Hartsman's team got to work, and soon the problem seemed fixed.<p>However, recent changes are making shamans <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=3e8be64cc0abdb741defd042fe33a9c8&amp;threadid=8785">nervous again</a>. Some of the mobs in Plane of Storms have been changed to be unslowable (which, go figure, makes slowers unhappy), but it also looks like slows are still bugged. A mob can be slowed properly sometimes, while other times the same mob seem to mitigate the whole slow. I've personally seen this in action against a non-Storms PoP boss mob, and it isn't a nice surprise when it happens.<p>Absor popped into the thread to let the smelly ones know he had let the Dev Team in on the problem, so hopefully they're scurrying to work on a fix.<p><BIG>...Talking of Michelangelo</BIG><p>If your UI is a bit drab or you feel the urge to customize a bit, the EQ Live site has an early holiday present for you. They recently posted some <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/multimedia/tking_index.jsp">artwork</a> by software designer/artist Tom King. There are some pretty nice backgrounds, spell icons, and images for you to tweak your UI, as well as <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=52757">instructions</a> for doing so.<p>Playing with the .xml files and customizing your own UI is fun. Breaking it, of course, is not. But that gets into the whole cake-and-eat-it thing, so forget the discussion and just jump right in. Backup your files first, though, Rembrandt.<p><BIG>Getting Chatty</BIG><p>The EQ Live site has a transcript of a recent <a href="http://everquestonlineadventures.station.sony.com/news.jsp?story=53125">developer's chat</a> from the EverQuest Online Adventures team. In case you've been sleeping in a cave for the past six months, EQOA is the PS2 incarnation of the EverQuest franchise, due out in February 2003.<p>It was nice to see former EQ spell guru Lawrence Poe again--his presence has been missed in Norrath. Larry brought up an interesting point in regards to how casual players will react to situations where they need to group:<p><B>It is a common misconception that EQoA is designed for just the casual gamer. EQoA has been designed to accommodate people of all playstyles. That being said EQoA is a community game. We have a grouping experience bonus to reward people who choose to take part in the community. We also feel that having this experience bonus will encourage people to want to get involved in the EQoA community.</B><p>It sounds as if the game has a tough niche to carve: transforming the casual couch jockey into an online adventure devotee. Ultimately, I think the game will sink or swim based upon the quality of its content. Good games attract players, pure and simple. Of course, convincing those players to pay a monthly fee in the console market is a huge hurdle, even with a wealth of content.<p>Another point worth noting in the chat was the hint at expansions that would include Odus and Faydwer. Here's a little tip for those EQOA testers who might not be familiar with EverQuest: DON'T BUY AN ODUS EXPANSION! The continent sucks now, it no doubt sucked 500 years in the past, and will definitely suck 500 years in the future. Unless you have a giant forehead in real life, just say no to Odus.<p>
