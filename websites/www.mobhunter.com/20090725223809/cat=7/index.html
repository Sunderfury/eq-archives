					<p>People occasionally wonder what kind of stuff I&#8217;m working on. This about sums it up:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The aim is to create a cathartic immersive interactive world with a <em>meta</em>, or <em>arch</em>, narrative facilitated through designed dramatic play.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What the hell does <em>that </em>mean? It comes from an article titled &#8220;<a title="As long as it has &quot;drama&quot; in there somewhere" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4061/dramatic_play.php" target="_blank">Dramatic Play</a>&#8221; by Stephen Dinehart, in which the author was kind enough to refer to several companies interested in expanding the definition of narrative gameplay, including the studio where I work. While it&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m not a fan of the academic study of game design, I found this a very interesting article. Because at the risk of sounding self-serving, I think the industry is on the brink of finally finding ways for games to truly become a medium for delivering a rich story experience.</p>
<p>Certain entrenched paradigms and assumptions need to be broken or discarded, because early generations of MMOGs proved that they don&#8217;t translate well to a fun gaming experience (example: HUGE BLOCKS OF TEXT DON&#8217;T WORK). But if we make this leap, games can grow as a legitimate art form and more consistently deliver the same emotional journey as movies, books, or plays&#8211;but in their own unique way.</p>
<p>There&#8230; I said it. I want to make <em>Art</em>. With a capital <em>A</em>. Yes, I <em>am </em>that pretentious.</p>
<p>However, I will take the quote above and rephrase it a little more plainly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The goal is to immerse players in a great story which they don&#8217;t just read, watch, or see acted out, but that they actually play through and impact in a meaningful way.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s really all there is to it.</p>

					<p>I was recently interviewed for an <a title="Hamma time!" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/69328" target="_blank">article on IP creation</a> by Cody at Ten Ton Hammer. Along with several other developers, I discuss the fun and challenges of building an IP from the ground up as opposed to licensing an existing property.</p>
<p>This was one of the better interviews I&#8217;ve done, in part because I could talk freely about this subject without detailing anything about the game I&#8217;m working on. Though it&#8217;s not as clear when one game is the sole face of an intellectual property, IP development is distinct from game development. The goal is to build something that can live across a number of mediums and feel like it was crafted solely for whatever incarnation you&#8217;re experiencing.</p>
<p>When it works, you don&#8217;t notice it. When it doesn&#8217;t, you&#8217;re left with a movie that doesn&#8217;t feel like the game, a game that doesn&#8217;t feel like the movie, a movie that doesn&#8217;t feel like the book, and so on. Examples of the latter are much more common than examples of the former.</p>

<p>Seriously, working with Bob is one of the best things about being at 38 Studios. Someone with his career could have come in and said &#8220;You schmucks will do it my way.&#8221; Instead, he&#8217;s been collaborative from day one, just as eager to hear what we have to say as we are to listen to him. And I think when people see our unique take on storytelling, they&#8217;ll understand why we had a heavy-hitter like Bob on board.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m back from NYCC and had a great time. The panel on 38 Studios went well, even though there have been a few complaints about us not talking about the game&#8211;this despite the <em>very first slide</em> and the panel intro making extremely clear that <em>we would not be talking about the game</em>. Most people attending understood what we were trying to accomplish, and our discussion of studio process and answers to the fan questions actually hinted at quite a lot of what we&#8217;re doing, if you knew what to listen for.</p>
<p>NYCC is great. It is smaller than the San Diego version, but in a good way. The crowds are still huge but you can actually make your way down the aisles reasonably well and interesting things can stand out rather than get lost in the crowd. I would recommend the show to everyone, but then NYCC will keep growing in size and soon it will be just as unruly as SDCC.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see as many costume tragedies as last year. Sure, there were a few Slave Leias that shouldn&#8217;t have left the house, but on the whole there were few attrocities. The best costume was one I saw on Sunday: a young woman bravely dressed as Poison Ivy wearing only some carefully placed leaf appliques and a flesh-colored thong. I don&#8217;t think she had an ounce of fat on her body, and needless to say she drew quite a crowd.</p>
<p>Not that I was leering, mind you.</p>

					<p>This weekend I&#8217;m headed back to the Big Apple with several 38 Studios cohorts to take part in a <a title="hells yeah" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/62128" target="_blank">panel discussion</a> at <a title="NYCC" href="http://www.nycomiccon.com/App/homepage.cfm?moduleid=2577&amp;appname=100453" target="_blank">New York Comic Con</a>. The theme of the panel is &#8220;MMO Development: Year Two.&#8221; It&#8217;s a follow-up to last year&#8217;s panel in which we talked about, uh, year one of the studio.</p>
<p>So this raises the question of exactly why we&#8217;re travelling to the heart of Yankee country when we&#8217;ve made clear that we&#8217;re not going to unveil the details of Copernicus this year. Well, first of all, Ten Ton Hammer asked us to do it and we like those guys. Second, it gives the MMOG fan a peek behind the curtains at how development works. Finally, its Comic Con! We&#8217;re geeks at heart and love to soak it all in.</p>
<p>If you happen to be attending the show and would like to say hello, our panel starts at 1:45pm on Saturday. I&#8217;ll be wearing my <a title="You know you want to see it" href="http://the-adventurers-club.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/adam_hughes_power_girl3_1.jpg" target="_blank">Power Girl</a> costume.</p>

					<p>On Thursday I&#8217;m making the cross-country flight to California to attend <a title="As if they need me to pimp this event" href="http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon/?rhtml=y" target="_blank">BlizzCon 2008</a>. A couple of us from 38 Studios will be there in relation to a project called <a href="http://www.azerothadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Azeroth Advisor</a> which you may have <a href="http://www.massively.com/2008/10/03/38-studios-acquires-mmo-newsletter-tailored-to-player-characters/" target="_blank">caught wind about</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be walking the show floor, chatting with gamers and soaking in the sights. And yeah, we&#8217;ll be taking notes so that one day when we have Copernicus fan events, they will be just as exciting as BlizzCon.</p>
<p>Oh, and I want that polar bear!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again: I much prefer fan events over industry gatherings. There is no substitute for meeting players face to face&#8211;even if they&#8217;re not players of a game I&#8217;m working on. So if you see a couple geeks wandering around in 38 Studios gear, be sure to say hello.</p>

					<p><a title="If you don't like what you read at Massively, wait 3 minutes and they'll have a new article up" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/07/30/comic-con-08-38-studios-interview-reveals-ip-announcement-next/" target="_blank">Massively has posted their interview with 38 Studios</a>, featuring Mary Kirchoff (VP of Marketing) and Thom Ang (Art Director).</p>
<p>This article is largely focused on marketing and big-picture plans for the studio. I thought Mary had a couple really good quotes, such as this response to why we&#8217;re doing a fantasy game:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our other perspective on fantasy is that it&#8217;s the most globally accepted medium for conveying epic stories. It&#8217;s accepted over the broadest number of categories in book publishing, which is one of the categories we&#8217;re going to develop our intellectual property inside. We want consumers to enjoy that experience of being in the world 24/7 in different contexts. Fantasy delivers to a global, broad market – just like 38 Studios.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As for when the game name and more detail on the IP will be forthcoming, Mary talked about that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our current plan is to announce the name of the game and launch the IP website (as opposed to the corporate website) about this time next year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the phrase &#8220;our current plan.&#8221; A lot can change in a year, so don&#8217;t get too worked up if those plans change.</p>

					<p>The folks at Ten Ton Hammer also spent some time with the 38 Studios crew at Comic Con, and <a title="Ten tons, and what do you get?" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/39993" target="_blank">wrote up a nice interview</a> in which Scott Cuthbertson (VP of Creative Development) and Thom Ang (Art Director) discussed the art style of Copernicus.</p>
<p>Of course, every gamer knows that what gets created in concept often doesn&#8217;t wind up looking the same way in game. Thom addressed this point well:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thom added, “One of the things that we’re doing to ensure this does translate into the actual game environment is that the concept artists who did this are actually the modelers. They’re taking their own paintings and, as artists they’re amazing, but as modelers and world builders they’re also amazing. They’re not having to hand this off to trust someone else to interpret it&#8230; They’re doing their own efficiency tests on it, so they’re involved from the beginning all the way through to end delivery.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For you detail-oriented types, it&#8217;s worth noting that the TTH article included the captions that yours truly wrote for the postcards, but the Zam interview I linked yesterday did not. We&#8217;ll make sure the missing captions get out there.</p>
