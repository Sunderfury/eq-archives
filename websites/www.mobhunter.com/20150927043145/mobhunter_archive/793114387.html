Well, No News</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-02-08</p>I don't know why the normally loquacious Absor has been so quiet the last couple days. Maybe Verant's entire staff is tied up trying to resolve this Prexus thing.<p>Normally, we at Mobhunter don't get all that excited about server outages (unless Xev goes down of course--then we raise hell). But in this case, we're really starting to feel for the Prexians. We even discussed you guys at our Friday lunch over plates of Chinese food and poorly written fortune cookies. Normally if your server happens to be down you just go and play on another for a while, or watch some <a href="http://people.bu.edu/wiegand/images/best_picture_ever.jpg">good TV</a> or something. But if you have to wait days, living in fear that your characters will be rolled back to some save from god knows when, you would probably start feeling some intense panic.<p>Verant is, I'm sure, working very hard to get the server fixed. They don't like outages any more than we do--really. When things are restored, we hope for the best for the citizens of Prexus. Hopefully Verant will figure out some way to compensate you for the inconvenience.<p>Oh, speaking of downtime, there is a patch on the horizon:<p><B>On Wednesday, February 13th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all servers will be down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 6 hours. <p>- The EverQuest Operations Team</B><p>Six hours means it will be a fairly large patch. The <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=9758.topic">Droga and Nurga revamps</a> might be making an appearance, but we'll see.<p>The other big topic at lunch today was the whole Legends brouhaha. Commentary on the new Stormhammer server has ranged from <a href="http://www.mmognews.com/article.php?sid=26">rational discussion</a> to <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=21643.topic">radical flaming</a>, with a touch of <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=14389.topic">satire</a> thrown in. A few are even trying to figure out the best way to <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=26444.topic">sploit</a> the whole concept.<p>While no doubt some will have <a href="http://www.snopes.com/spoons/photos/grave.htm">harsh words</a> for us, we just don't understand what the fuss is about. If you don't want to play on Legends, then don't subscribe to it. Why bother getting upset about it? That's like a Festiva owner getting pissed because Ford also sells the Mustang. Companies certainly have the right to offer expensive versions of their products--life would be pretty boring if they didn't. Do you only want one type of cheese or bread or beer? Then why do you insist on only one flavor of EverQuest?<p>Some people seem to think that with the addition of Legends Verant will somehow abandon their existing users--&quot;ghetto folk&quot; as Tigole called us. There is simply no logic to this fear. Whether you like or hate Verant's existing customer service and quest teams, expect these GMs to remain at the same level they always have. See, Verant gets to use the extra money they make from Legends to--get this--hire <B>more</B> staff members. So no one gets taken away from the &quot;ghetto&quot; servers, and all us po' folk can play the game the same way we always have.<p>As for those who think the population of Legends will be nothing but wannabes who can only find fame by paying more money--get over yourselves. For the most part, the only way people get fame in EverQuest is to devote ridiculous amounts of time to playing this silly game at the expense of any kind of actual social or family life (or you just run a half-assed news site, but that's a story best saved for my therapist). Sure, you can flip off every guy you see driving a BMW as you chug along in your Hyundai, telling yourself he needs an expensive car to make up for his incredibly tiny penis, but you're only fooling yourself. The way the world works is this: some people make more money than others, and buy fancier toys. That's all Legends is--a fancier toy.<p>Ah well, that's about all I can muster late on a Friday afternoon. Then again, just as I'm about to publish this story, Absor posts some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000485.html">beastlord junk</a>, perhaps heralding some actual news. We'll see.<p>Some days, you just can't win.
