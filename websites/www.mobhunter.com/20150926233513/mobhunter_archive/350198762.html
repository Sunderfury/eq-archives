<html><head><title>Odds &amp; Sods</title></head><body><h1>Odds &amp; Sods</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-12-20</p>This patch message might throw you for a loop. By my estimation, <I>none</i> of the changes listed here were really expected.<p><B>December 20th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<p> * Bug Fixes *<p> - Fixed a bug with sleeves not showing properly when wearing robes<p> * Item Changes *<p> - Aqualung charges should now work properly<p> * Trade Skill Changes *<p> - Regular, medium quality, high quality, mithril, brellium and adamantite rings, as well as their enchanted versions are now stackable.<br> - Added a few trade skill vendors to Ak'Anon<br> - Added ore, clay, pottery sketch, baking, and brewing vendors to Felwithe to round out the tradeskill supplies available in Felwithe and Kelethin.<br> - Crafted fishing flies, special fishing poles and special baits now add a fishing skill bonus.<br> - Made all Bait and flies equipable in the Ammo slot.<br> - Added clay, ore and brewing supply vendors to Halas.<br> - Added several trade skill vendors to Oggok.<p> * Localization Information<p>Localization on the EverQuest login/chat server has been fixed so that users can once again select French and German. Japanese and Korean have also been added.<p>To obtain the text files which enable a language, go to the Advanced Options screen in the patcher and click on the appropriate language box before clicking on &quot;Download&quot;.<p>*  Soulbinders *<p>A new group has appeared in Norrath (and on Luclin as well).  Rumor has it that these 'Soulbinders' have dedicated themselves to research on the power and essence of our inner being.  Some call them fanatics, as they claim that knowledge of the spirit that dwells within will lead them to an understanding of the whole of existence. Citizens often treat them with the same respect and distance that they treat the Priests of Discord.  However, these Soulbinders  have dedicated themselves to public service, and for them that service falls along their lines of specialty...<p>The next time you find yourself far away from home, you might seek the services of a Soulbinder.<p>/ooc: We've added these &quot;Soulbinder&quot; NPCs to all cities that player characters can start in, as well as Shadowhaven and Iceclad at the request of players.  It is our hope that these new NPCs will help players by reducing the time it takes to find a bind from another player character.</b><p>Soulbinders? That's an idea that has been kicking around for years, and has always been shot down by Verant. (Have you noticed how many of these &quot;won't do that&quot; ideas have come to fruition since Brad left?) Putting binding NPCs in game makes sense, plain and simple. Well done.<p>Verant continues to improve trade skills bit by bit (pun intended). While these changes are generally viewed <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=994.topic">positively</a>, there are some old-school trade skill folks who think the younger generation has it too easy. &quot;Why, I used to have to walk to and from Highkeep uphill both ways in 20 feet of snow!&quot; Time to wake up and smell the '00 decade, Grandpa.<p>So there are two very positive changes in this patch, and a few bug fixes... but what about the big stuff? Specifically, things that were <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-495589445">mentioned</a> only yesterday:<p><B>- Reducing loading and zoning times<br>- Crashes occurring for some people when logging in<br>- Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing that character<br>- Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound configurations.<br>- Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or duplicated<br>- Characters changing to wolf form look tiny<br>- Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects<br>- Faces that sometimes don't remain as selected<br>- New Bard Area of Effect songs are acting strangely <br>- New Necromancer group debuff spells are not working properly<br>- There is a very short pause for some players when other players enter a zone<br>- A few players are being disconnected at random<br>- Slow framerate on some fast computers</b><p>I guess we have to figure out on our own which--if any--of those changes went live.<p>And are we just supposed to assume that the aforementioned <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-129569541">change</a> to Temple of Veeshan went live? Specifically:<p><B>- In the next patch, we are making a few changes to the monster population in Temple of Veeshan. Places that were previously safe to camp, may not be any longer. Please be sure to not camp deep within the Temple of Veeshan on Wednesday night, or you may be unpleasantly surprised following the patch.</b><p>Now Verant might say, &quot;Well, we told you it was changing, so we don't need to say it again.&quot; But the way patches lately have been so hit-or-miss, you'd think they would want to be perfectly clear about what was included.<p>In other words, this patch is a mystery, wrapped in an enigma... No, wait a minute. A riddle, wrapped in a mystery, enclosed in an enigma... Oh, to hell with it. Log in and find out for yourself what changed.
