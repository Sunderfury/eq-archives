<html><head><title>The Time Has Come</title></head><body><h1>The Time Has Come</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-12-09</p>Today, on all US-based servers, the nature of the way mobs spawn penalizes everyone in the four major US time zones: Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern. We're going to explain how exactly the game is broken, and urge SOE to fix it right away.<p>Before we begin, you need a basic understanding of  how time zones around the world work. The main &quot;standard&quot; of global time is known as <A HREF="http://greenwichmeantime.com/">Greenwich Mean Time</A> (GMT). Named for the city in England that lies at zero degrees longitude, GMT is the baseline by which global time can be measured. For example, I live in Minnesota, which is in the Central time zone. During Central Standard Time, Minnesota is six hours behind Greenwich time; therefore, CST is expressed as (GMT -6). When Minnesota observes Daylight Savings Time, we move our clocks forward one hour in the spring. Thus, Central Daylight Time is expressed as (GMT -5).<p>For the sake of reference, here are some places around the world and how their standard time zones are expressed in Greenwich Mean Time:<p>Sweeden (GMT +1)<br>Sydney, Australia (GMT +10)<br>Japan (GMT +9)<br>Iraq (GMT +3)<br>Hawaii (GMT -10)<br>South Africa (GMT +2)<br>Jamaica (GMT -5)<br>Moscow (GMT +3)<p>How does this relate to EverQuest? If you've noticed, patches are always listed on the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/lowsrc/support/scheduled_downtime.jsp">Scheduled Downtime</a> page in Pacific time, since that's where the EQ offices are headquartered. Patches usually start at 3 AM Pacific, which is 11 AM GMT, as England is eight hours ahead. If a patch lasts five hours, that means the servers are supposed to be up again at 8 AM Pacific, or well before most US players even log on. In England, though, the same patch gets done at 4 PM, which might impact the playtime of a lot of people there.<p>This is a standard complaint of many European players--a long patch can easily cut into their prime-time hours. While this is indeed unfortunate, SOE does it this way on the basis that <I>if you have to negatively impact your user base, it's best to affect the smallest number of users possible.</I><p>Re-read the above statement carefully, because I'll be referring back to it later.<p>Okay, so patches are designed to minimize the impact upon US players, since that's where the majority of EverQuest customers reside. Seems reasonable, right? So US players should be happy with this, correct?<p>Well, not the ones in the mid- to high-end game--as in any player with an interest in killing ubermobs. Because of the way these mobs currently spawn, players outside the four major US time zones--especially those in Europe--have a clear advantage. Why? Because the prime time for almost every raiding guild is the early evening hours of whatever time zone they are in. Since Europe is five to eight hours ahead of the US, that means Euro players can kill multiple targets before most US players are even home from work.<p>Boss mobs spawn one of two ways--either immediately when the server comes up or with a random (often within 24 hours) timer. A lot of the bosses in Planes of Power fall into the former category, which means these mobs (many of which give flags to deeper zones) can be monopolized by players outside of US time zones. When one guild deliberately uses this fact to stop the advancement of another, this is commonly known as &quot;cockblocking,&quot; and it remains an issue.<p>But don't randomized spawn times fix the problem? In theory, but not in practice. Say the servers go down for a two-hour patch, coming back up at 5 AM PST (1 PM GMT). If a prime-time raid for a US-based guild in the Eastern time zone starts at 7 PM, that gives a European guild 14 hours in which to get to mobs first. An awful lot of &quot;random&quot; ubermobs pop within those 14 hours. And when you've got multiple guilds competing at the upper end of the game, when critical mobs in Ssra or Vex Thal are contested targets, that gives non-US players a completely unfair advantage.<p>This is not to say that guilds outside the US shouldn't have a fair shot at content. The key phrase being, of course, <I>a fair shot.</I> There's nothing just or balanced about the way boss mobs currently spawn, because the ability to get to a spawn is not governed by how skillful your guild is or how able you are to kill the target, but simply by what time you can log in to the game.<p>Proponents of the current system argue that such obstacles can be overcome through negotiation. US guilds should simply work out deals with Euro guilds in order to rotate spawns. While that's a nice idea, the fact is that if two guilds are at the exact same level in the game, the Euros have the upper hand. Aside from a spirit of cooperation, what's the motivation for a Euro guild to agree to any such compromise? They have a better shot at getting the mobs they want anyway. The US guild has very little to offer.<p>This situation needs to change. It's a matter of customer service. The vast majority of EverQuest players are located in the four main US time zones. SOE favors those customers already by planning patches around them. Why shouldn't mob access be handled in the same fashion?<p>Well, it <I>is</I> easier on SOE's customer service department this way. What is one of the trickiest disputes for a guide/GM to handle? Two uberguilds fighting over a mob. With the current spawn method, the CS staff avoids a lot of headaches. Coincidence, or just a byproduct of a flawed system? It's fodder for conspiracy theorists, to be sure, but there might be some grain of truth in it.<p>So what is the solution to all this? When in doubt, SOE should go back to the principle I pointed out above: <I>if you have to negatively impact your user base, it's best to affect the smallest number of users possible.</I> Only certain time zones can have the best shot at ubermobs--that's just a fact of life. The players who deserve that shot should be the ones in the four major US time zones. This is where the majority of customers are located, and these are the people SOE should be most concerned about pleasing.<p>Change spawn times so that the majority of boss mobs are most likely to spawn between the hours of 5 PM and 11 PM Eastern. This would spread out the targets enough that no single guild could monopolize them all, while still leaving some targets open for guilds that raid at non-standard hours.<p>The spawn window has to be relatively short in duration. Currently Euro guilds have the first crack at boss mobs, but they also have a pretty good shot at picking up the ones that happen to take a really long time to spawn, as any mobs that pop after the typical US guild raid times will just be picked off the next day. Thus the majority of spawns need to fit inside the hours I listed above.<p>Ah, but wouldn't changing the spawn times bring back the old problem of racing for ubermobs? Sure. But it would also create a level playing field for the vast majority of the player base. It would give guilds a real motivation to work out deals and rotations, as players find themselves on much more equal footing. Euro guilds could still negotiate for spawns--it's just that they'd be at a disadvantage in doing so, instead of the other way around.<p>This isn't a matter of preferring one country over another or making things harder for a certain ethnic group. It's about pleasing the majority of customers--something SOE should have a keen interest in doing. It would be foolish for localized servers in Europe or Asia to cater to anyone other than the players in those time zones, right? Think of the classic EQ servers as being localized in the US and apply the same logic.<p>Whatever level of the game your guild finds itself in, this issue should be an important one to you. We urge you to write letters to the SOE customer service people and to file petitions in game.<p>The game is broken. The game is unfair. Fix it, and fix it now.<br>
