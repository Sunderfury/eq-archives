		<description><![CDATA[Most of my MMORPG game time has been in non-fantasy MMORPGs and in most cases that has meant that you play some variation of a human just because there is not really any other choice (AO, E&amp;B, EVE, CoH/CoV etc). For MMORPGs with non-human races I guess it mainly comes down to that the character does not look hideous and I can have some theme for it that I like. 
E.g. in EQ2 my favourite character was my Ratonga brigand; liked the class and liked concept with an evil little rat. In SWG my favourite was human (ranger/creature handler), in FFXI an elf, in WoW an undead mage. 

For classes - no specific name/type here and I am an altoholic, so I will play lots of different ones. But the ones that tends to stick typically have some some crowd control or debuff capabilities that requires an eye for the surroundings, combined with some damage dealing. E.g. FFXI BeastMaster, CoV Dominator, AO Bureaucrat.]]></description>
