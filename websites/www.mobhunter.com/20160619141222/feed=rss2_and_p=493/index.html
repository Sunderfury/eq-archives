		<description><![CDATA[After doing some digging, it looks like JMS refuses to do any more of the straight-to-DVD &quot;Lost Tales&quot; series because WB won&#039;t give him a bigger budget than the first (disappointing) installment had and Joe doesn&#039;t want to cheapen his legacy. Can&#039;t say I blame him.

WB could have all the CGI shots redone for a new set of discs. I feel like it&#039;s almost inevitable that it happens someday, but probably not anytime soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately, Warner Brothers lost all the digital assets for the show, so don&#039;t expect the SFX to be redone.  That is why the Sfx look crappy on the DVD&#039;s - they were originally shot in 4:3 and when they did the DVD&#039;s they did 16x9.  They were able to recrop the original film assets and have nice sharp video, but all the Sfx shots had to be cropped from the original 4x3 video frames resulting in fuzzy video.  It is sort of funny watching the DVD&#039;s and seeing it go fuzzy - sharp - fuzzy - sharp as the Sfx scenes appear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oddly enough, my wife and I just started going through Season 5 of B5 again yesterday.  Well... again for me -- 1st time for her.  Few months back we started marathoning the whole series, but we burned out after Season 4, and with Season 5 not *quite* being up to the standard that Seasons 3 &amp; 4 set, I didn&#039;t worry about it, but yesterday she said &quot;We still need ot finish Babylon 5&quot; so.. into the dvd player it went.

As far as a remastering goes... I don&#039;t know.  In a lot of ways that &quot;Amiga-era CGI&quot; was pioneering the whole CGI thing.  Wasn&#039;t B5 the 1st wholly CGI show ever, and the techniques they learned then improved on and used by others over time?  For the &quot;historical reference of how CGI once was alone, I think it should be preserved.  That said, I wouldn&#039;t be averse to a remastering either.]]></description>
