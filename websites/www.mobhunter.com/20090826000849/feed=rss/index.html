		<title>YouTube Hot Dev Panel Explosion Darkfall!</title>
		<description>The post on my site that gets the most spam is titled "Minnesota MMO Blog Explosion!" so I figured I'd make another post with a spammer-friendly title and give the bots a new target.

Anyway, I spent part of my weekend on a panel at the inaugural GameUnicon here in Massachusetts. ...</description>

		<title>A Random Observation on Game Artists</title>
		<description>On one side of a room, imagine a realistic drawing of a mushroom. On the other side of the room, imagine a realistic drawing of a human penis. Now imagine a line connecting them which is made up of similar drawings, each becoming gradually more stylized.  Somewhere along that line, ...</description>

		<title>Lest I Miss a Chance at Self Promotion&#8230;</title>
		<description>I recently did an interview with Stephen E. Dinehart that was just published to his site.

In an age when I can't talk about the details of what I'm working on, Stephen asked some very good questions that let me talk about the philosophy of what I'm working on.

Thanks to Mr. ...</description>

		<title>Roberts on Generational Evolution</title>
		<description>My friend and colleague Jason Roberts (Dymus) is generally a man of few words, so when he says something, it's worth your time to listen. He recently made a post in the 38 thread on FoH which merits further attention, so I am quoting it here. His post was in ...</description>

		<title>The Road to Austin</title>
		<description>As reported by Gamasutra, my old nemesis Owlchick and I will be doing a presentation at GDC Austin with the antagonistic title "Writing for MMOs: You're Doing It Wrong." Doing the panel was Tracy's idea; the title was mine.

I have no idea how we suckered the GDC folks into accepting ...</description>

		<title>A Great Idea and $4 Will Buy You a Latte</title>
		<description>This is going to get a little link-crazy, so pay attention.

Over in a thread on FoH about Scott Hartsman leaving Ohai, Illucide referenced an old post from Furor on his visit to Sigil when Vanguard was still in its very early stages.

tml;dc (too many links, didn't click) - Furor pretty ...</description>

		<title>Live Team Blues</title>
		<description>Check out a great post by Eric at Elder Game talking about the cycle a live game goes through as it matures and a new generation of developers comes aboard.

It's very true that a lot of game developers enjoy shipping a title and then moving on to the next. In ...</description>

		<title>Design by Checklist</title>
		<description>Myrix recently made an apt post, the thesis of which was "put the game first, and don’t let the 'MMO' get in the way." He asserts that just making an MMO isn't special anymore, and he's right. While the genre has an inherent appeal, in today's crowded market you need ...</description>

		<title>Our Deepest Secrets, Laid Bare</title>
		<description>People occasionally wonder what kind of stuff I'm working on. This about sums it up:
"The aim is to create a cathartic immersive interactive world with a meta, or arch, narrative facilitated through designed dramatic play."
What the hell does that mean? It comes from an article titled "Dramatic Play" by Stephen ...</description>
