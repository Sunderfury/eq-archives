					<p>The post on my site that gets the most spam is titled &#8220;<a title="hotness" href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=126" target="_blank">Minnesota MMO Blog Explosion!</a>&#8221; so I figured I&#8217;d make another post with a spammer-friendly title and give the bots a new target.</p>
<p>Anyway, I spent part of my weekend on a panel at the inaugural <a title="Arguably one of the worst designed websites you'll ever see" href="http://www.gameunicon.com/" target="_blank">GameUnicon</a> here in Massachusetts. I was joined by my cohort <a href="http://www.nerfbat.com/">Shwayder</a> and <a title="No, not the BBC chap, although he is British" href="http://elvishparsley.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Justin Webb</a> from <a title="The OTHER MMO developer in Maynard" href="http://www.tencentboston.com/" target="_blank">Tencent Boston</a>. We had an excellent discussion with the seven people in the audience (only one of which was a spouse!).</p>
<p>As proof of our awesomeness at the event, here is a video that Justin and Angela put together.</p>

					<p>On one side of a room, imagine a realistic drawing of a mushroom. On the other side of the room, imagine a realistic drawing of a human penis. Now imagine a line connecting them which is made up of similar drawings, each becoming gradually more stylized.Â  Somewhere along that line, the mushroom will become indistinguishable from the penis.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced that there are some game artists for whom the ultimate quest is finding that point. I can&#8217;t explain why. But somebody needs to come up with a name for this phenomenon.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=523" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Roberts on Generational Evolution">Roberts on Generational Evolution</a></h2>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>My friend and colleague Jason Roberts (Dymus) is generally a man of few words, so when he says something, it&#8217;s worth your time to listen. He recently made <a title="It's just about the only thing worthwhile in the whole thread" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/24711-green-monster-games-curt-schilling-475.html#post1467589" target="_blank">a post in the 38 thread on FoH</a> which merits further attention, so I am quoting it here. His post was in response to the notion that &#8220;the Next Generation of MMOs is coming&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m quite literal and thus a generation is defined by an iteration and building upon the best of what came before. Since MMO&#8217;s take roughly 5-6 years from inception to completion let&#8217;s use that with the overlap. Given that, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re in the midst of generation 2 and working on generation 3. I&#8217;m also keeping the focus to subscription and &#8216;classic&#8217; style MMO&#8217;s, adding the other branches gets unmanageable and I want to stick to one family tree.</p>
<p>Generation 0:  IRC, play by e-mail, web games, MUD&#8217;s (This is obvious)</p>
<p>Generation 1: (1999-2004) Asheron&#8217;s Call, EverQuest, Ultima Online, Meridian 59, Dark Age of Camelot, Anarchy Online, and others.</p>
<p>Generation 2: (2003-2008) World of Warcraft, EVE Online, EverQuest II, Warhammer, Conan, Star Wars Galaxies, Final Fantasy, Matrix Online, City of Heroes, Vanguard, and several others.</p>
<p>Generation 3: (2009-2014) Whatever Blizzard is making, Star Wars: Old Republic, Whatever Carbine is making, Heroes of Telara, whatever else Trion is making, Copernicus, and others.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s play evolution&#8230;<br />
<strong>Generation 1</strong>: There were three main models that passed on their genes &#8212; Ultima Online, EverQuest and Dark Age of Camelot. There were traits that the second generation inherited from all the other games but the primary evolutions in generation 2 came from those three.</p>
<p>What did generation 1 teach us? MMO&#8217;s work. Playing with other people is fun. Raiding is cool. Organized PvP is cool. Emergent gameplay is not always a bad thing. Among a whole host of other things, but it was all new.</p>
<p><strong>Generation 2</strong>: What defines generation 2 is a refinement of the main ideas from the prior generation. In this, one game had one very key adaptation: Accessibility. Other evolutions happened they just were not as successful.</p>
<p>But what has Generation 2 taught us? People like to play &#8216;around&#8217; others but not necessarily always &#8216;with&#8217; others. Accessibility and polish are of critical importance when there are choices. Focus on what your game IS not what it COULD be. (A corollary is that radically changing a game mid-flight is probably a bad idea). Building massive worlds and system generated content to fill them is bad.</p>
<p><strong>Generation 3</strong>: We&#8217;re just starting here. But there are now two generations to learn from. Not all the ideas from generation 1 were refined in generation 2 since they were so overshadowed by the one big adaptation of Accessibility and polish. I think those are a given by now, if you don&#8217;t have that adaptation you can&#8217;t compete in the natural selection. The question is, will Generation 3 hit on anything like that adaptation and be a clear trait to carry forward? Perhaps&#8230; a lot of us are guessing what it could be, and it might be that there is more than a single answer.</p>
<p>What do I think generation 3 teach us? Story (personal and world focused) is more important than people guessed. You can successfully apply the working models to more genres than fantasy. You can make a massively single player game and still be successful. If you don&#8217;t seriously include socialization as a goal you&#8217;ll have a serious retention problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people are still quick to throw the tired phrase &#8220;next gen&#8221; around. When I was community manager on EQ2, I had to constantly hear a certain game being touted as &#8220;third gen&#8221; without any substantive merit as to what that meant, so I really like Jason&#8217;s delineation. It&#8217;s not about technology or platform, but about key adaptations and innovations. After all, building Pong with fancy 3D assets doesn&#8217;t make it a next-gen game. Truly ushering in a new generation is about building upon what went before and adding both polish and some interesting new twists.</p>

<p>tml;dc (too many links, didn&#8217;t click) &#8211; Furor pretty much posted that Vanguard was going to kick ass. I quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This game was fleshed out and built from the ground UP. These guys put so much work into getting the game built that it would be impossible to put everything in this update; and also illegal. Thousands and thousands of pages of gameplay design and documentation &#8211; Iâm talking massive BOOKS, full of lore, maps, class descriptions, races, monsters, everything. You wonât see any MOONS popping up out of nowhere in this game. Expansions, additions, extensions, all thoughtfully planned out&#8230;. The folks at Sigil already have a quality product on their hands and I cannot wait until they release some information to the public so all of you can have the pleasure of getting a glimpse of what I got to see during my visit.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of those who tried Vanguard would suggest that the aforementioned quality was noticeably lacking in the final product. So what&#8217;s up? Was Furor lying, or at the very least stretching the truth so that he could stay in the good graces of some old friends?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. I think what happened on his visit was that Furor was presented with stories and visions, plans and ideas. And they sounded good. They had heart behind them. When coupled with some fancy artwork and a workable tech demo, Furor drank the Kool-Aid: he bought into the notion of <em>What Could Be</em>. Needless to say, he wasn&#8217;t alone&#8211;the Sigil forums were dominated for years by those who believed that Vanguard would be The One Game which would rule all others, and were willing to poke anyone who disagreed in the virtual eyeball.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy for fans to hear a passionate developer talk about ideas and begin to believe that they will be brought to life just as described. It can even happen to the very people working on a game! Developers can get so caught up in the game playing in their heads that they lose sight of the reality of the game that actually exists on their hard drives.</p>
<p>What is the ultimate root of this mass delusion? The simple fact that <strong>ideas are cheap</strong>. Even great ones.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got a great idea for an MMO. So what? It means nothing unless you can pull it off. That means you must have both the skills necessary to implement it (writing, scripting, populating, coding, modeling, etc.) and the means to put it in game (stable, usable tools). If either your skills or your ability to implement falls short, your great idea will die a death of futility. The Graveyard of Ideas is full of great ones that simply couldn&#8217;t be pulled off.</p>
<p>Once again, it comes down to a simple truism: It&#8217;s all about execution. Do you have the skills to do it? Do you have the means to make it happen? And, if the answer to both those things is yes, do you possess the determination to polish your work to immaculate perfection as well as the strength of will to scrap it entirely if it doesn&#8217;t serve the fundamental pillars of your game?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to pick on poor Vanguard. Any number of failed games (MMOs and non-MMOs alike) could have been used to illustrate my point. Books, movies, music, TV shows&#8230; the same thing happens in every medium. Millions of dollars get thrown around every day on the strength of what someone believes to be a great idea. It&#8217;s not the idea that&#8217;s the gamble; it&#8217;s the ability for the investee to be able to execute it as well as they can talk about it.</p>
<p>By doing a bit of extrapolation, you begin to see why making a great MMO is so damn hard. You can make a successful console game if you execute one truly great idea extremely well. To make a great MMO, you need dozens of interconnected systems all based on great ideas executed extremely well, supported by thousands of iterations of quests, items, appearances, and locations executed to the highest degree of polish and care. All it takes is one major flaw to bring down all your great ideas like a house of cards. On top of that, if you have mediocre people implementing great ideas, those great ideas will end up looking mediocre.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like you can&#8217;t win! Maybe all of us in this business are gluttons for punishment. Or perhaps, for some of us, the possibility of pulling it off is too intoxicating to resist.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not (always) idiocy or incompetence that makes high-profile MMOs fail. It&#8217;s more that a whole bunch of interconnected things all need to go exceptionally right for one ofÂ  these games to come together. More often than not, it&#8217;s a few specific weaknesses in crucial areas that cause certain games to be considered a disappointment in the eyes of players.</p>

					<p><a title="Live is not sexy" href="http://www.eldergame.com/2009/07/08/the-warcraft-live-teams-b-squad/" target="_blank">Check out a great post</a> by Eric at Elder Game talking about the cycle a live game goes through as it matures and a new generation of developers comes aboard.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very true that a lot of game developers enjoy shipping a title and then moving on to the next. In the console world this is how it&#8217;s done, of course; the MMO universe operates as a live service after launch, which is something even many seasoned developers are not used to or interested in. So having people move on is an expected part of the process.</p>
<p>The first year after EQ2 launched saw a number of its senior people leave, either for new opportunities within SOE or to other companies. But since the game remained SOE&#8217;s flagship product for some time, the team still had ample resources and plenty of good people on board. And as <a title="because he posts about *everything*" href="http://brokentoys.org/2009/07/10/scott-hartsman-leaves-scott-hartsman/" target="_blank">Lum mentions</a>, <a title="one of the best" href="http://www.hartsman.com/" target="_blank">my friend Scott</a> proved an invaluable presence who led the team to make many popular changes to the game. (Oh, what might have been if only so many of the game&#8217;s formative years of development hadn&#8217;t been squandered&#8230; but what&#8217;s done is done.)</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who&#8217;s done a fair bit of it, fixing other people&#8217;s broken shit is not always fun. I&#8217;m not referring to the kind of stuff where a design decision was made one way and you&#8217;d rather take it another; I mean coming across something horribly broken and convoluted<strong> </strong>that unfortunately crept into the game because at some point quantity was more of a priority than quality. But you do learn an awful lot from the experience, some of which is applicable to starting a new project from the ground up and some of which is not.</p>
<p>New projects are inherently sexy and fun. It&#8217;s a chance to make all new kinds of mistakes instead (you hope!) of repeating old ones. But by the same token, I agree with Eric that there is a lot to be said for working on a live game&#8211;especially if it&#8217;s one you love and want to see get better. But as he notes, a new generation of developers can sometimes be overwhelmed by good intentions and leap to make changes before fully understanding the implications. Hopefully the transition between the &#8220;A&#8221; squad and the &#8220;B&#8221; team is gradual enough that an osmosis of wisdom can occur and leave the new caretakers with everything they need to do the job well.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=508" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Design by Checklist">Design by Checklist</a></h2>
				
				<div class="entry">
					<p>Myrix recently made an <a href="http://www.thewanderingrogue.com/2009/06/putting-the-game-before-the-mmo/" target="_blank">apt post</a>, the thesis of which was &#8220;<strong>put the game first, and donât let the &#8216;MMO&#8217; get in the way.</strong>&#8221; He asserts that just making an MMO isn&#8217;t special anymore, and he&#8217;s right. While the genre has an inherent appeal, in today&#8217;s crowded market you need to concentrate on delivering a fun experience over just satisfying the particulars of a formula.</p>
<p>To put it another way: Don&#8217;t fall into the trap of designing a game by checklist. That is, you could come up with an entire list of criteria you believe to be required to satisfy your audience (persistence, loot, mounts, quests, combat, instances, etc. etc.) and check off every item, only to be left with a game that isn&#8217;t any fun. Players will forgive the absence of specific features; they won&#8217;t forgive broken features crammed together to make the back of the box look good if the result is an absence of fun.</p>
<p>It was a startling revelation from a Tabula Rasa developer that the game went into beta with the knowledge that it wasn&#8217;t fun yet. A game shouldn&#8217;t even go into production unless it&#8217;s fun, let alone make it into beta. Production is about having a solid core and being able to replicate it. If that core game isn&#8217;t fun, you&#8217;re just going to mass produce a bunch of un-fun content. Not a smart move, as history has proven.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake an MMO developer could make in today&#8217;s climate is to say &#8220;I must duplicate every one of WoW&#8217;s features in my game in order to be successful.&#8221; Blizzard is too far ahead of you to make that a realistic development goal; you&#8217;d inevitably end up cutting corners and falling short of the necessary polish and fun. Instead, decide early on what core elements make your game fun and focus your love and attention on those things. Use your core values as a razor to cut away excess and never lose your focus on the fun.</p>

					<p>People occasionally wonder what kind of stuff I&#8217;m working on. This about sums it up:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The aim is to create a cathartic immersive interactive world with a <em>meta</em>, or <em>arch</em>, narrative facilitated through designed dramatic play.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What the hell does <em>that </em>mean? It comes from an article titled &#8220;<a title="As long as it has &quot;drama&quot; in there somewhere" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4061/dramatic_play.php" target="_blank">Dramatic Play</a>&#8221; by Stephen Dinehart, in which the author was kind enough to refer to several companies interested in expanding the definition of narrative gameplay, including the studio where I work. While it&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m not a fan of the academic study of game design, I found this a very interesting article. Because at the risk of sounding self-serving, I think the industry is on the brink of finally finding ways for games to truly become a medium for delivering a rich story experience.</p>
<p>Certain entrenched paradigms and assumptions need to be broken or discarded, because early generations of MMOGs proved that they don&#8217;t translate well to a fun gaming experience (example: HUGE BLOCKS OF TEXT DON&#8217;T WORK). But if we make this leap, games can grow as a legitimate art form and more consistently deliver the same emotional journey as movies, books, or plays&#8211;but in their own unique way.</p>
<p>There&#8230; I said it. I want to make <em>Art</em>. With a capital <em>A</em>. Yes, I <em>am </em>that pretentious.</p>
<p>However, I will take the quote above and rephrase it a little more plainly:</p>
<blockquote><p>The goal is to immerse players in a great story which they don&#8217;t just read, watch, or see acted out, but that they actually play through and impact in a meaningful way.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s really all there is to it.</p>

					<p>I was recently interviewed for an <a title="Hamma time!" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/69328" target="_blank">article on IP creation</a> by Cody at Ten Ton Hammer. Along with several other developers, I discuss the fun and challenges of building an IP from the ground up as opposed to licensing an existing property.</p>
<p>This was one of the better interviews I&#8217;ve done, in part because I could talk freely about this subject without detailing anything about the game I&#8217;m working on. Though it&#8217;s not as clear when one game is the sole face of an intellectual property, IP development is distinct from game development. The goal is to build something that can live across a number of mediums and feel like it was crafted solely for whatever incarnation you&#8217;re experiencing.</p>
<p>When it works, you don&#8217;t notice it. When it doesn&#8217;t, you&#8217;re left with a movie that doesn&#8217;t feel like the game, a game that doesn&#8217;t feel like the movie, a movie that doesn&#8217;t feel like the book, and so on. Examples of the latter are much more common than examples of the former.</p>
