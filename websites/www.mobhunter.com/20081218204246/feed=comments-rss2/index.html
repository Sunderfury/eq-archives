		<description>Now that ive had more time to think on it... if it was something cosmetic.. kinda like what WoW is doing now... but lets say more like... Having your armor look like any armor set you want instead of X armor I would pay a bit for or something along those lines... but again nothing that gave a player a item advantage over another.</description>

		<description>SOE has to make some money, this is the aim of a company but the station cash is "too much".
The players give their fee each month so an item shop is a bit excessive in this case. I suppose that others companies will keep an eye on the station cash and will do the same thing if it's finally a success.</description>

		<description>I have to agree with most of the posters here, that the EQ loot system gave me the most "thrills" as I leveled up.  

Also, that feeling of success in acquiring a cool item started right at the beginning of the game.  I loved the fact that you started with crappy weapons and no ability to fight magical beings.  I'll never forget the first time I pulled a Wisp with my tarnished sword and got my butt kicked because I couldn't hit it back.  After that I remember planning for weeks to level up, save some cash and make the trip to North Karana to buy my first magic weapon.   There were many others items that stood out - Short Sword of Ykesha - Ghoulbane - Soulfire - Ranger Ivy Armor - J Boots - the list goes on and on.  

My point is that many really great items could be acquired throughout all levels - either through receiving a gift from a knowing higher level character, or by careful planning and questing.

Modern game give us so many ways to acquire loot and make it pretty easy to buy items that are as good as anything that drops and much of the "thrill" is gone.  It has become simply part of the game that you get cool stuff, whether you've earned it or not.</description>

		<description>I wouldn't miss it either.  It's ridicules, and depressing. As much as I would love working there, some of these decisions might drive me through the wall.  Hard to be a long term fan (since 99), watching some of this stuff.  

I'm pretty much done with EQII until EQ3 (pending it's not playing with the goofy cool-aid), or until somebody new brings a realistic fantasy game with a great deal of choice.</description>

		<description>But we miss you!

Even though we don't play EQ2 anymore -_-

Perhaps you'd like to come be the Sodality Community manager? We could pretend to be upset about things and you could soothe our fears?</description>

		<description>Indeed -- I can't imagine that this is going over too well.

For myself, I don't know the details of the items available yet, but so long as they're "fluff" and garbage things like XP potions, and not something like fabled weapons/armor/jewelry, then I don't have a problem with it.</description>
