		<description>I've seen BSG up through about halfway in to season 4.  I'll eventually watch the 2nd half, but right now it's sorta a pain, since I don't get sci-fi channel in my cable package and I don't currently live where my PC is so hulu or a torrent are currently out.  Ah well.. I'll catch it eventually.  For me, most of watching it has been like watching a train wreck -- you're fascinated and can't look away, yet it's simply a bloody awful mess.  I want to finish it out, just so I can "know what everyone's talking about" amongst my friends, but that's about the only reason I'm gonna worry about it.

Never seen Lost nor had any desire to.

Heroes.... I don't know why I keep watching.  I know I wouldn't miss it if I stopped.  I think I'm back in to "train wreck" territory here.

I've enjoyed Dollhouse so far -- 3rd episode was better than the 1st 2 for sure.  Rumor has it that even Whedon says it kinda sucks until about the 7th episode, though.  I'[ll give it a half season and see what I think then, I suppose.</description>

		<description>I think viewer expectations can differ radically depending on how many TV serieses a viewer is watching. I'm following about a dozen TV serieses during any given season, so I tend to be a bit more of a forgiving viewer. I'm not concerned about "bangs" and "whimpers" for example. If you're following only one series, your expectations will be dramatically higher for that single series.

Regarding the plan, there will be a movie called just that, "Battlestar Galactica: The Plan", in June which will explore, well, the plan from a Cylon perspective. If you missed the other movie, watch "Battlestar Galactica: Razor". In early 2010, the "Caprica" series will begin which will explore the feuding families and the origin of the Cylons. The pilot will be available on DVD in late April of this year.</description>

		<description>My plan worked!

I called BSG out and they responded with the best episode so far this season.

Seriously, I liked this episode quite a bit. It gave a side of Starbuck we rarely get to see.  If Starbuck doesn't turn out to be part Cylon (either we find out she's actually the first Cylon/human hybrid or she has part of that 13th model's DNA somehow), I don't know how they're going to explain her death and rebirth.

It was also nice that they finally got back to Hera being important. Cool use of psycho Boomer, and a nice twist with the Chief.

Three episodes to go.</description>

		<description>I got into BSG late. I avoided watching it because I wanted to watch it all and enjoy the whole story arc.  Late last year I finally started watching the DVDs with my better half, and we're now watching the weekly series together.

I read an interview that said the writers were very much playing by ear.  For example, the "...and they have a plan!" bit at the end of the intro of the previous season was thrown in there because it sounded cool, according to what I read.  I'll be damned if I know what that plan was, though; anyone else got any ideas?

I think one problem with this latest season is that they know it's the end.  The mutiny on Galactica took three whole episodes; that's one less episode than the New Caprica storyline!  But, during the New Caprica events, you had so many things going on at the same time: the plight of the people stuck on the planet, the discussions of the Cylons running the planet, the doubt of the military commanders on the ships, etc.  During the mutiny, the story only really focused on the two sides.  It felt excruciatingly slow, especially compared to the earlier seasons I had just watched.  However, it still concerned the characters I had grown to know and love over the past several months, so it was still compelling to watch.  But, as others have said, I don't think it's as good as it could have been.

Sadly, I think this is still some of the best TV overall.  It's the only show I bother watching on a regular basis.  We'll see if the series ends with a bang or a whimper, though.  Knowing what they've pulled in the past, though, it could be both.

My thoughts.</description>

		<description>I can't say I disagree. I had really high expectations for these last few episodes and I've had a few warm feelings at best. The first of the ten was so terribly depressing and from there we've only gotten a little better. Time is drawing near and we still have two major issues:

1. There are still a lot of really angry Cylons out there.
2. They need a place to live.

I understand that the final five relate directly to those two issues but I'm kind of losing the feel on the whole prophecy thing. Lets get back to some BSG action, buck up a bit, tie up the loose ends and give the characters peace (or blow them all up).</description>

		<description>I have no qualms with the progression of Battlestar Galactica. I don't think Anders revealed as much as you suggested either. I also have no qualms with Legend of the Seeker. I thought the pilot, cinematography, and combat scenes were excellent.</description>

		<description>Good on you for speaking the truth on BSG - that's what happens when the story loses its way (and you're making it up on the fly), death by writer's committee.  Listen, truth is the final season is a bloody mess and it's beyond redemption.  Maybe when the hardcore fandom dies down and people objectively look at it, they'll realize that BSG simply fell apart after real promise.  Sad, really.

And Dollhouse?  Awful show.  Insufferable.  Dushku clearly can't carry this thing and it's a derivative and uncharacteristically dull offering from Whedon.  Put it out of its misery NOW.</description>

		<description>Blasphemy!  But yeah, it's not as wonderful as it could be but it's still some of the best broadcast TV around.  I love BSG and didn't get into it until stumbling across it on Amazon Unbox and have been glued ever since.  I downloaded and watched all previous seasons to catch me up.  I don't know how people withstood all those cliffhangers having to wait a week for answers.  OMG what will I watch when this is gone?!? *QQ big splashy tears*</description>

		<description>I agree, but I think Lost is suffering as well.

Seriously.  You HAVE to get back on a freakin' plane in order to get back on the island?  And all of these crazy stupid circumstances (with a little help from our friend Ben) lead every one on the same plane to Clarksville?  I mean, c'mon...I understand that you have to be able to "suspend belief" a bit when you watch it, but this is getting a little ridiculous.
