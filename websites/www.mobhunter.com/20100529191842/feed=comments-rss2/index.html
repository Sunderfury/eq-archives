		<description>Looking back at all my favorite video game memories, even the &quot;single player&quot; games, I think a lot of the nostalgic feelings are, like for so many, related to the friendships tied to them.  I remember thoroughly enjoying the experience of playing the first few final fantasies (at least the ones that made it to the states, properly stated are FF1, 4, and 6, though released here as 1, 2 and 3), but my enjoyment wasnt so much because of the games themselves (even though they were all really well done), instead it was the fact that myself, my younger brother, and at least one if not 3 other friends all sat and enjoyed the games together.  It was like one long interactive movie experience, because not only having more eyes meant less was missed, but it was social and fun.  Like watching pro wrestling.  Mostly entertaining on it&#039;s own (assuming you like fight-dramas), but much, much better with friends (and beer).  When the main characters (in the game, or I guess in wrestling) gets through a really tough fight by the skin of their teeth, it&#039;s way more exhilarating when everyone is there feeding that euphoric feeling.

Or that&#039;s my take.  Knowing that makes it easier to go back and play old games, but it&#039;s still never the same.  most times when I want that nostalgic feeling I just turn on one of the soundtracks.  Less disappointment.</description>

		<description>[...] Galidin

I remember very early EQ Abashi (the original Community Rep) commenting that everquest was a chat channel where you played a game between conversations. [...]

 I played a cleric in original EQ and for the first 30 levels I spent the majority of the game looking at my spell book and watching health bars, I never even saw the fight most of the time, so there was only one thing to do and that was to chat. I still remember names of players I haven&#039;t played with in 10 years. Some times I would log in with no intention of actually doing anything, just chatting with friends. With a limited number of places to go you saw the same people all the time, if you had a reputation as a jerk/idiot you were pretty much screwed, no one would group with you. I have played a ton of MMO&#039;s since EQ and although most are far superior game play wise, the community of the original EQ can&#039;t be beat. 

 Moorgard I too recently tried EQ again when steam had all the expansions for $2 or some crazy amount, I logged in and was wondering why my character wouldn&#039;t move when I pressed the W key and then remembered you had to use the arrow keys to move. Just running around PoK was a nightmare and yet I played well over 150 days of playing time. 

 When I was a young kid growing up I remember my favorite song on the radio was &quot;Play grounds in my mind&quot; I hadn&#039;t heard the song in at least 30 years, so I found it on the web and OMG It was the most horrible song ever. Some times things don&#039;t age well...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exzwmcAFW4Y

		<description>No doubt old EQ is dated in many ways.  The UI and controls are clunky and unfamiliar now.  The graphics are old and unsophisticated even if the art still looks good given the low poly counts.  There are huge flaws in the game design that players lived with back then.  Even though it&#039;s impossible for me to go back and play and enjoy it like I once did, I don&#039;t discount the great memories and the very many great things about EQ.  I think they were all real, even if we can&#039;t enjoy them anymore like we once did.

I&#039;ve gone back to EQ a few times just to run around and visit old places and solo a bit.  Every time I think why hasn&#039;t any MMO since created such a great and interesting world.  Maybe part of what made it great was that nobody new exactly what to expect with MMO games, but the developers also did so many things well.  I can remember the annoying tick-tock sound that was constant in Akanon, and so many other little details that made exploring the world of EQ so fun.  And I hear so many similar stories from old EQ vets that I know it&#039;s not just me.  I think memories can be clouded in two ways - remembering things fondly that really weren&#039;t so great, and also discounting older things just because they are now the &quot;old&quot; way.</description>

		<description>I haven&#039;t seen the new Clash of the Titans yet but I share your sentiments in regards to the original movie. As a child, I was completely enthralled with the storyline. My roommate rented the old one recently and I only watched the very beginning and was surprised by how different it seemed. I like to think that I&#039;m an imaginative person, but I doubt that I&#039;ll ever be as creative as when I was a little kid. Sometimes, the less you know, the more you see. And that&#039;s why being a noob in EQ or WoW is much more exciting than creating an alt. Faydark used to be a mysterious place to explore. Trying to find my corpse in the dark after being killed by a pixie trickster was terrifying (not an exaggeration), despite being only a few yards away from Felwithe. Whenever I return to Faydark, it&#039;s as though it&#039;s lost most of it&#039;s magic, it&#039;s character. MMOs need to find a way to keep players in that kid full of wonder mode because the best stories are &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; the ones told by NPCs.</description>

		<description>Absolutely agree. Nostaliga is such a powerful thing. I tried playing Anarchy Online again last year and I gave up after battling for hours trying to get my controls and UI to work the way I wanted. I couldn&#039;t even figure out how to zoom out :( I guess we just take too much for granted these days and lament about the &quot;good ol&#039; days&quot; with clouded judgement :)</description>
