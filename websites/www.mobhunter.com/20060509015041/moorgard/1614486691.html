We'll skip the froggy welcome and just get right to the good stuff:<p><B>** Gameplay **<p>We've adjusted the entry requirements for some Planes of Power zones.  Several of these zones required each character to complete a quest before gaining entry.  We've relaxed this requirement somewhat as follows:<p>* A raid with 32 or more members can enter a locked plane provided that 85% of the raiders have finished the entry quest.  This means a raid group can bring along some friends who haven't completed the quest.<p>* Characters who haven't done the entry quest must stay with their raid while they are in the locked zone.  If these characters leave the raid for more than three minutes, they will be transported out to the Plane of Tranquility.<p>* Using this method does not grant permanent access to the locked zone.  If a character wants permanent, unescorted access to a locked zone then they must still complete the quest.  The goal of this change is to allow raiding groups to bring along a few friends who haven't been able to complete the quests, but still wish to help with the raid.<p>- Several of the flagging events will now only give out a maximum of 72 flags each time they are completed.<br>- The dialogue boxes for resurrection and translocation will remain for 5 minutes instead of 1 hour.<br>- Increased the maximum number of members on ignore and friends lists to 100.<br>- Made some adjustments to the Halls of Honor alternate entry quest that should make it more friendly.<br>- The horse buff icon will no longer show up for characters using non-Luclin models.<p>** Interface **<p>- Containers now close after zoning.  This prevents a bug that was causing the same container to be opened twice.<br>- The rogue hide message &quot;You have moved and are no longer hidden!&quot; is filtered as a &quot;skill&quot; message and not an &quot;other&quot; message.<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing the spell effects opacity slider to always return to 0% when logging out to the desktop.<p>** Items **<p>- Happy Dragon should no longer use a charge when the target is out of range.<br>- The inventory icons for Trydan's Greaves of Nobility, Deathwatch Sword and Wetfang Steak have been corrected.<br>- Corrected the name of the Drakescale Covered Tunic (was Drakscale Covered Tunic).<br>- The Manicle of Disruption has been renamed Manacle of Disruption.<br>- See above for Vorshar's Manicle of the Blight.<br>- Corrected the spelling of Golden Idol of Rodcef Nife.<br>- The Rantho Rapier is now a piercing weapon, not a two-hand slashing weapon.<br>- The Wand of Mana Tapping is no longer labeled as usable in the secondary hand (since it is Enchanter only and could not be used there anyhow).<p>** Quests **<p>- Made a change to the way Planes of Power spell quests work. All spells usable by more than one class are now obtained from the same level quest.  If a spell is level 61 (Ethereal) for one class and level 65 (Rune Word) for another, both will have it as a reward on their Ethereal quest.<br>- Corrected issues with the quest from the Iksar Hermit.<br>- Corrected a grammatical error in some of Bolli Hillfoot's text.<br>- Marshal Anrey should be more responsive when talked to.<br>- The &quot;Bag of Troll guts&quot; is now dropping off of the correct NPC.<p>** Zones and NPCs**<p>- Removed the ability for PCs to bind in the upper tier Planes of Power zones.  Binding is allowed in Plane of Knowledge and Plane of Tranquility.<br>- The entrance to the Plane of Fire now requires the appropriate keys for entry.<br>- Gods in the elemental planes now have fixed respawn regardless of zone outages.  If the god in an elemental plane is up when the zone comes down it will still be up when the zone comes back up.  If it has two days left before its respawn when the zone comes down it will still respawn in two days.<br>- Prior to this patch Rallos Zek was changed, he no longer allows anyone he dislikes to stand above the arena.<br>- Removed a &quot;safe spot&quot; from the Plane of Disease.<br>- NPCs in the Plane of Justice can no longer be affected by Fear spells.<br>- Fixed an issue with some level 10 NPCs in the Karanas having about 400 times the hit points that they should.<br>- Denizens of Aerin`Dar's lair will no longer be getting angry at folks just because they are stomping around on the ground above the lair.<br>- Puslings now understand how to &quot;enrage&quot; properly.<br>- Creatures in Fungus Grove will be less likely to ignore people shooting them from a distance.<br>- Mature Arboreans are now plants.  Just don't call them that to their faces.<br>- Giant Whiskered Bats in the Qeynos area no longer drop rat skulls.<br>- Dalin Greskar has given up his hobby of trying to sell blacksmithing gear that he doesn't have and has gone legit with pottery supplies.<br>- Corrected a typographical error in some of Tarnic McWillows speech.<br>- Firon Dernkal will no longer add a random &quot;t&quot; to the end of people's names when talking to them.<br>- Corrected an error in Eirod Haerod's text.<br>- It seems as though the troll sent to retrieve the Forge from fallen Grobb has returned with Forge in hand.<br>- Corrected an issue with the respawn of Fennin Ro.<br>- A Kromzek spy will no longer give a &quot;beta neutral&quot; faction hit when killed.<p>** Spells **<p>- Fixed a bug that prevented the owners of charmed warders from controlling or re-summoning their warders after the charm breaks.<br>- Disinfecting Aura has been changed to no longer cure poisonous effects.  It will now cure disease effects with much more potency.<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing Bind Sight to fail to land if the recipient had exactly 15 other buffs.<br>- Convergence should not eat its component as often on some types of spell failures.<br>- Corrected the spell book icons for several Enchanter spells.<br>- Shadeweaver port should no longer place you beneath the world.<br>- In a previous update, we added a message when a person recasts a charm spell on their charmed pet.  Recasting charm on an existing pet did not actually re-charm the pet, it just failed silently and appeared to succeed.  The new message is now displayed intentionally in these cases.  This is not a bug.<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Attack text for the Vah Shir when punching now says, &quot;punches&quot; instead of &quot;hits&quot;<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing the reduced statistics to not update properly when the character has low hit points or is encumbered.<br>- Fixed a bug that caused some sale prices for items in the Bazaar (mostly those with a lot of 9s) to be invalid. <br>- The /guildmotd command has been modified.  Guild leaders and officers can now use this command to set or clear the guild Message of the Day.  There is a new command, /getguildmotd, that can be used as an alternative to viewing the Guild MOTD in the Guild Management Window.</B><p>Most folks are glad to see the flagging solution go live. While actual numbers might be debatable, I'd say 85% of a raid force being flagged for a given zone is a fair requirement. Any larger number would sort of defeat the purpose of having flags at all. Of course, to get everything working you either need all the non-flagged people there at the start of the raid or you need to leave a &quot;flag mule&quot; in Tranquility to invite the non-flagged to your raid. So far the solution seems to be working.<p>Limiting the number of flags given by key mobs is both good and bad. While probably put into place to curb the growth of &quot;meta guilds&quot; (large numbers of people banding together to kill boss mobs and obtain flags), there's a chance that all it will accomplish is to require such confederations to make even more attempts at zerging flag-givers. There is also the fact that a cap of 72 flags will limit legitimate guilds a bit, in that more killings of bosses might be required to get all members and bots flagged for necessary progression. This will certainly be a situation that merits watching.<p>Casters are happy with the change to spell quests in PoP. It was a complete waste of runes to have them yield sub-65 spells that crossed over to other classes, and it's good that this situation is finally remedied.<p>The change to the spawn times of elemental gods is interesting. Finally NPCs are no longer tied to server outages--which will both limit the amount of godly items coming into the world and negate at least some of the benefit of intentionally crashing zones. Now the question is, should this technique be applied to non-PoP bosses as well? Certainly there's no point to making Vox and Naggy limited in this way, but certain key mobs like the Emperor in Ssra might be good candidates to consider. Would this be good or bad for the game? You tell me.<p>Shamans are excited over something that crept into this patch--<a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=7aaaa658fae9d736831871213c0382ba&amp;threadid=11305">new alchemy products</a>. Things like illusion potions and gate-to-bind potions might finally breathe some life into this tradeskill, assuming component cost and availability isn't prohibitive.<p>The mapping functionality that LoY offers seems to work pretty well. If you don't want to spend time making your own maps, you can check out the ones available at <a href="http://www.eq-toolbox.com/">EQ Toolbox</a>. I'm sure other forums for map exchanges will be popping up all over the place very soon.<p>Those newly introduced lizard mounts are purchasable for all races and classes, and some of them look okay I guess. The first time I saw one running, though, I nearly doubled over with laughter--it looks like someone trying to ride a mechanical bull. I'm not sure how a wee gnome or halfling would be able to stay on the back of one of those things, but the laws of physics have never exactly been at the top of the SOE development checklist.<p>The new zones (what I saw of them) seem pretty cool. While most of the new mobs are variations of existing models, everything I saw turned out quite well. Undead trolls are creepy, those luggald things are slinky, and the modified Erudites (as seen in today's caption) are mega-slutty, giving Christina Aguillara a run for her money. (Please note, for the record, that I am not referring to the lovely Mrs. Moorgard model, who, while enjoying a liberal sense of fashion, is in no way skanky.) My exploration of the troll caves was a bit limited solo, as all the green and light blue cons were working together to humiliate me--I play a monk, after all, and thus am virtually defenseless. I'll review the new zones more when I return in a serious effort to fill my charm slot.<p>Of course, not all is bright and rosy with the dawn of LoY. Item links seem to be semi-fubared again, and many people's UIs are in need of updating (though you should have been prepared for that). But all that pales in comparison to the worst, most intollerable part of the Ykesha expansion: armor dyes.<p>It didn't take long for places like the Plane of Knowledge and the Bazaar to be filled with garish monstrosities of blindingly bright colors as people try to outdo each other's bad taste. What you end up with is ridiculous nightmares like this one:<p><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/dyesmustgo.jpg"><p>I cannot emphasize enough what a massive mistake this armor dye system was. SOE just managed to cheapen its own game--something it had been pretty good at avoiding for the last several years. I explained before how they could have implemented a dye system that makes sense, but they chose to go with a method that allowed this kind of garbage. For the benefit of the EQ2 team--as well as developers of competing MMORPGs--let me explain again how armor dyes <I>should</I> work.<p>Player-made armors should be dyable within realistic ranges. Leathers should be browns, blacks, dark greens, greys, and possibly dark blues. Metallic armors should be limited to metallic shades--black, silver, gold, bronze, copper, etc. All of these kinds of armors should only be tintable at creation, just like Ultima Online originally did it. Robes that casters use should have greater freedom of color choice, as should visible cloaks if you implement them. It makes sense for cloth to have a wide range of colors, though some limitations still make sense.<p>Armor that drops from mobs <B>should not</B> be tintable. Period. End of discussion. This would allow developers to use unique colors for boss drops or quest items. If you see someone in crimson plate, you should be able to tell that they have obtained something rare and unique, not that they were simply able to find the dye vendor.<p>It's probably too late to fix this in EQ, since the genie was unfortunately let out of the bottle. But look at that picture above one more time. It's stupid. <I>Stupid.</I> You can say how nifty it is to dye armor and make your character unique, but the fun of screwing around with colors doesn't change the fact that seeing characters run around in gear like this weakens the game for a lot of players. EQ may be winding down a bit as its own sequel and numerous competitors draw near, but there's no reason to nudge it faster into the grave. Moves like this do so, at least for a lot of us.<p>The other big gripe with this patch comes from casters, who are disgruntled over the <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14502">change to horses</a>. Complaints about this are dubious at best. While a better solution would have been to make mounts visible all the time regardless of which models you had on, that might not have been workable. Horses were designed to provide the benefit of increased mana regen while standing at the cost of losing the ability to interrupt spells. Using old models to make horses invisible negated that downside, making it a mild form of exploit. Now you have to enable new models for your character to use the horse--it's just a fact of life. While this adds other inconveniences, I'd still call it a fix rather than a nerf.<p>And just because I don't get enough hate mail from casters...<p><BIG>Spelling It Out</BIG><p>The final LoY site update centered around <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_spells.jsp">new spells</a>. Each casting class gets two new ones, plus of course the new Stonebrunt ports for wizards and druids.<p>Surprise, surprise--<a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=24996.topic">casters are complaining</a>, or at least a lot of them are. Some because it's only two spells per class, others because the spells aren't uber enough, others because they aren't more varied.<p>Well, in case you've forgotten, LoY's new content is aimed at the 30-60 crowd, and that's where these spells fall. Many players in that range are pleased, especially druids, who get <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=30350.topic">a new mid-level heal</a> that they sorely needed. And everyone should be pleased about the new priest spell that cures poison and disease counters.<p>Sure, some of the spells are better than others, but keep in mind that melee are getting *nothing* unique with LoY. So whining isn't likely to net you a lot of sympathy from us hack-n-whack types.<p><BIG>Welcome Back, Welcome Back, Welcome Back</BIG><p>Those who have cancelled their EQ accounts in the past were greeted by an e-mail from SOE the other day that read in part:<p><B>Thanks for making EverQuest&reg; the most popular MMORPG of all time! In celebration of our upcoming four year anniversary, we've reactivated your EverQuest account and invite you to come back and enjoy EverQuest again for free, for 30 days! Now is the best time ever to play EQ. Your friends are here and there are a ton of new features to check out. And best of all, there's no need to re-register; just log in and play!</B><p>Well, nobody said the marketing department at Sony was made up of dummies. This is a smooth move on their part to lure back those who think they've kicked their EQ addiction. Like any good dealer, they give you a free sample to get you hooked again. I wonder how many network news stories will be broadcast about this.<p><BIG>A Schism with an Ism</BIG><p>Graffe's wizard board has been around for a long time, and provides a great resource for casters in particular and players in general. But like any established message board, sometimes the signal-to-noise ratio can become a bit unfavorable, and useful information can fall by the wayside.<p>This is, in part, why one of the Graffe moderators--Rombus of Povar's Triton guild--decided to <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=24970.topic">split off</a> and make his own wizardly resource, dubbed the <a href="http://www.arcanist.com/">Arcanist's Hall</a>. The place must be getting good traffic, because they already had to move to a beefier provider. Now Rombus has his own venue for providing what he feels to be crucial info that all wizards need.<p>Hopefully this move will prove more successful than similar splinter projects that try to spin off from a popular class board. Then again, maybe a failure would be nice--it would mean one less site I have to troll for news.<p>Oh well, good luck anyway, Rombus.<p><BIG>On the Road Again</BIG><p>Expect this week to be a bit light on the updates (I know, surprise surprise) because I am leaving Thursday on a Mobhunter-related field trip. I don't want to reveal what I'm up to quite yet, but next week you should see the fruits of my labor. How's that for a teaser?<p>
