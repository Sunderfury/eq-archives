<html><head><title>The Boston Report</title></head><body><h1>The Boston Report</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-08-04</p>My good friend Kadal attended this weekend's FanFaire in Boston and took copious notes for us. We know you want the straight poop, so let's just jump right in:<p>- The Sleeper's Tomb revamp will be going live on non-Legends servers in a month or two. Of course, Mobhunter readers knew this already.<p>- Some mobs in Ssra Temple may be going to a random spawn timer soon.<p>- Targeting and spell casting problems with the new UI are known and are being worked on.<p>- Group shrink for shamans is being discussed, possibly with a confirmation box added. According to a <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=a42735407acde7e0bbe2ec4919fc3e56&amp;threadid=4014">post</a> at the Shaman's Crucible board, alchemy will undergo a revamp at some point.<p>- Verant is pleased with the way the Bazaar is working now, and no major changes are likely to be made for several months. As for lag issues, bring your clipping plane down to make the zone livable again (this actually helps a ton, by the way). There are no plans to add Bazaar stalls to any other zones.<p>- Problems with sound cards are not a priority right now. The entire sound engine will be redone at some point, which should fix most issues.<p>- Additional teleport spells in Luclin are unlikely.<p>- Ancient spells were designed as a reward to players who are in guilds that can experience the very highest-end content, and they should not be thought of as an entitlement. Think of them more like rare nodrop gear, I guess.<p>- The fact that the effects of blind spells and knockbacks still hit you even when you resist the spell is a known bug, but because the code that handles it is tied to so many other things it is very hard to fix. They're working on it.<p>- Stats on Vex Thal drops are being reviewed.<p>- Zone crashes when entering Great Divide, Shadowhaven, and Dawnshroud still affect many people, though it's better than it used to be. It's an old bug that the team works on when it can, but it isn't a huge priority.<p>- The level limit on Nagafen and Vox will remain.<p>- Ragefire will not be changed. Just let it go.<p>- Plane of Mischief is being completely revamped--really. It should go live (on Legends, presumably) in the not-too-distant future. They might even move the entrance.<p>- The numbers required to kill the Emperor in Ssra are what will be needed to polish off the high-end stuff in Planes of Power. In other words, 80 or more people. However, there will also be single group and 3-4 group encounters.<p>- The idea of transferring to a new server with some items is being reviewed. Most likely this would be limited to your epic, though this is being debated. For instance, what about the people who have lost epics in a server move already?<p>- The Flowing Thought cap is indeed 15, not including the Mental Clarity AA ability.<p>- Key rings will not be implemented. Instead, the necessity of keys will be removed through the use of flags that determine if your character has access to a given area.<p>- One of the things we've downloaded in recent patches was the new spell particle engine. Expect some surprises in the coming weeks. It is Verant's intent that we will actually want to have particle effects on.<p>- The stat cap on items will not be increased past 127. In other words, +125 items in Vex Thal and PoP are as high as we're going to see.<p>- Pet pathing is tough to change, and isn't likely to improve a lot at this point. Changes like pet aggro reduction will hopefully make up for that.<p>There is additional coverage over at <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/">Monkly Business</a>, along with some horrible sounding .wav files you can download if you enjoy talking through tin cans tied together with string. Along with a general recap of the weekend, some info posted there includes:<p>- The 30-item limit for merchants in the Bazaar is something that is hard coded into vendors, but they're working on it.<p>- Verant is not going to release another product before it's done.<p>* crickets chirping *<p>Hey, they said it, not me! I guess Planes of Power will be their first test. Verant is in a no-win situation by saying this, of course. Any major PoP change will be met with cries of &quot;see, they lied!&quot; and if they do ship a mostly complete product the naysayers will write it off as a fluke.<p>Oh well. It got them applause at FanFaire, I guess.<p>The biggest disappointment to me was that Planes of Power wasn't on display. Come on, they showed it at E3... there must be some cool stuff they could have demoed for everyone.<p>The second-biggest disappointment is that the next FanFaire will likely be held in San Francisco sometime in November. That flat-out disses the midwest once again and rules out my Vegas trip for a few more months at least. Chicago in November would have been fine--even wimpy Californians could have handled it. This puts the FanFaire after next sometime in February, which would <I>not</I> be a good time to have it in the midwest, so it would likely have to be in the southeast.<p>It's a conspiracy, I tell you. Absor is afraid of me. I hear Scott Hartsman wets his pants when he gets an e-mail from me.<p>Anyway, feel free to chew on this FanFaire news and complain to your heart's content. A big thanks to Kadal for sending us her excellent notes.
