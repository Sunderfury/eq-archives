		<description><![CDATA[What a great tribute, Steve. Some of the things you said here really tugged at my heartstrings. Vanguard was the first game after EverQuest that I gave my heart to while it was in development. I put a lot of emotional stock into the Vision. I worked to build a thriving community for the game at Ten Ton Hammer, and was saddened when the game launched and ultimately didn&#039;t reach its potential. 

You wrote: &quot;By any objective benchmark, Vanguard was never a great game. But the love we have for MMOs isn’t about benchmarks–it’s about heart. &quot;

It really is. When an MMO and its community finds a place in some fans&#039; hearts, even when it touches only a small group of fans, I believe that MMO was, at least on some level, a success. Rest well, Telon.]]></description>
