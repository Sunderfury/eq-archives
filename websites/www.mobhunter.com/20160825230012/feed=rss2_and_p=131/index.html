		<description><![CDATA[I understand, no-hitter&#039;s are very rare abit like improbability of probability.
But what do I know about Baseball? Nothing
 
As they say, chances of reason arrives pricesly when they are due.
Wether  to time or the cunning ability of people in it&#039;s surroundings to change the path as cyan said. So long as &quot;it&quot; knows and decided to let them, the contrary is probable
The invisible pen is at the mercy of every words and people behind them. 

Delicate subtelty, that singular sensation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Moorgard smirked to himself slyly and started walking away,.  He thought, it is just getting so easy to mold these people.  They &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; playdoh in my hands.    He thought to himself (almost out loud) , how could I have been born with brains, good looks, AND the ability to cunningly change people&#039;s minds without them realizing it, life was good he thought.  He continued down the hall whistling a little Shins on the way back to his desk.

He never saw the 98 mph baseball baring down on his back like a cruise missile until it was to late.

My split is back, Curt thought to himself.  Oh yeah.  Its back.]]></description>
