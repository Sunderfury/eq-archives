		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree that i think this is an Andy Kaufman style prank...although, given the very serious history of the Phoenix family (cults, drug over dose, abuse, etc.) I think Joaquin is going to be able to play the crazy card for a long time in this gag.  

I hate to admit it, but I can&#039;t wait to see what he does next.  Andy Kaufman said: 

&quot;Pure entertainment is not an egotistical lady singing boring songs onstage for two hours and people in tuxes clapping whether they like it or not. It`s the real performers on the street who can hold people`s attention and keep them from walking away. &quot;

I hope this turns out to be a joke (so I won&#039;t feel bad about laughing at a crazy young guy), but either way I&#039;m not going to be able to keep my eyes off this train wreck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the new link, cgoodno.

If it turns out to be a hoax, then the question becomes whether Letterman was in on it. If he was, then both he and Phoenix deserve Emmys for that appearance, because it was spectacular.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[New link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXpYk7WGN5Y

Now, as far as I&#039;m concerned, the only difference is that Leno doesn&#039;t actively get people who are obviously going through some mental/social/personal changes and isn&#039;t really there.  I don&#039;t like the uneasiness of it all and would rather not publicize the family member who&#039;s not all there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Phoenix is either 1) totally friggin&#039; bonkers or 2) playing an elaborate joke on everyone.

Either way, Letterman was fantastic and if it was a joke he played it up like a pro.
