<html><head><title>Halloween Weekend Recap</title></head><body><h1>Halloween Weekend Recap</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-10-29</p>Over at The Safehouse, they're <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8514.topic">discussing</a> some of the in-game events that occurred over the weekend. For the most part, it sounds like things went pretty well. Sure, there was the requisite slaughter of newbies as they tried to get a peek at what all the shouting was about, but some people actually benefitted from the strange goings-on. For example:<p>- The planes were completely repopped many times, and drop rates were reportedly excellent.<p>- A GM-controlled Nagafen clone appeared in SolB.<p>- Lots of dragons--including Zlandicar, Sontalak, and the Kunark dragons--would repop a few hours after being killed. This happened with other high-end mobs like King Tormax, too.<p>- &quot;An Ancient Dragon&quot; spawned in different zones on multiple servers as part of a GM event.<p>- A clockwork dragon made appearances as part of a GM quest.<p>- Multiple copies of mobs (3 Trakanons, 2 Tunares) were spotted.<p>- A shipwrecked gnome in Cobalt Scar needed guidance back to Iceclad Ocean.<p>- The sky in Nektulos Forest changed colors repeated, then everyone turned into a werewolf.<p>The kids at Slow News Day became <a href="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=82">obsessed</a> with the <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-1412051519">promise</a> of Fluffy the Grizzly, and determined that this bear was part of a GM event in Misty Thicket.<p>Phat lewts ranged from lousy junk to pretty damn impressive stuff. All in all, most people seem to have had a lot of fun.<p>Now, we just need about four more weekends like this to tide us over until Luclin arrives...<p><B>*** Updated 9 AM CDT ***</B><p>Mobhunter's own Csenicier took part in an event just this morning at Karnor's Castle. Seems an Evil King, an Evil Knight, and an Evil Jester make their way from Chardok to join forces with Venril Sathir. The noble adventurers in zone joined up with a GM-controlled paladin to lay waste to the evil foes. The armada then took on VS himself, and emerged victorious.<p>Phat lewtz were handed out, including a Necklace of Superiority to Csenicier.<p>Now, when someone like Csen starts getting even moderately phat lewtz, it becomes time to examine the situation a little more closely. Are these Halloween events a shot in the arm for the game, or just another example of the MUDflation that has gripped EQ as of late (buff the players, buff the mobs, buff the players... <I>ad infinitum</i>)? Is the endowment of super powers and super loot going to be the bribe that Verant pays to get you to stay away from DAoC for another month?<p>Bah, screw the intellectual debate. Where's my phat lewtz???<br>
