<html><head><title>Time to Wake Up</title></head><body><h1>Time to Wake Up</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-07-29</p><BIG>Tomb Remodelled, Hosts Grand Opening Party</BIG><p>Those of you who have been faithful readers of Mobhunter for a while now may remember how much coverage we gave the whole Sleeper storyline when it first began to unfold. Back then &quot;Conquested&quot; became a synonym for &quot;screwed over,&quot; and the notion of a quest to return Kerafyrm to his slumber was alive and well.<p>But that was long ago. These days the Sleeper has been awakened on almost every server, and the Sleeper's Tomb zone has become a place for a couple groups to farm exp and weapons.<p>Over the weekend, though, Kerafyrm hosted a party in his redecorated lair, showing it off to be a place filled with new bosses, much harder yard trash, and brand spankin' new loots. Being a little short on cash, the non-sleeping Sleeper had a rather steep cover charge for his bodacious bacchanal--$40, to be exact.<p>Certain Legends subscribers over on the Stormhammer server were invited to test--er, experience--the <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm15.showMessage?topicID=174.topic">revamped ST zone</a>, now called Kerafyrm's Lair. The &quot;new&quot; zone has a lot more mobs, more bosses, multiple quests, and fancy new lewtz. Primal weapons have been replaced by Ancient Prismatic weapons with pretty much the same stats. The four warders who so miserably failed at their job to keep Kerafyrm slumbering have supplanted by all-new dragons that presumably aren't pansies. Oh, and the biggest quest of all seems to be a 10-item combine that requires drops from each of the bosses of the zone. Unlike the Vex Thal quest, though, the quest pieces seemed to actually be dropping in a reasonable time frame. Other points worth noting are that the quests give a lot more background on the story of the Sleeper, and some mobs are giving positive dragon and negative giant faction when killed.<p>Will this revamp ever move to the live servers? We certainly hope so. While the notion of world-changing dynamic events is really the future of MMORPGs, the whole Sleeper thing never worked out as well as anyone hoped. Rather than making Kerafyrm's awakening something cool that everyone on the server would want to see, it turns out that getting the Sleeper out of bed just makes people bitter because they didn't get a shot at gnome masks and monk robes. The promise of replacing a boring tomb with the much more interesting lair might even provide the servers with a napping Sleeper a good reason to wake him up.<p><BIG>Dragons Seek Mudbath in Swamp, Return Home</BIG><p>In other dragon news, a new scaley tenant <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11661.topic

">has arrived</a> in the Swamp of No Hope. Named Ithiosar the Fallen, this dragon respawns immediately upon death as Ithiosar the Black. While the <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=19034.topic">loot is nice</a>, the dragons seem to be on the upper-end of wurmish encounters, unlike the other more established Kunark residents.<p>Fans of the Veeshan's Peak zone--if any truly exist--will be pleased to hear that <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11657.topic">Hoshkar has returned</a> from an extended vacation as a sack lunch. That is, the poor dragon had been spawning as a bag on the ground rather than as his nasty AE-spouting self.<p>While I have read reports that VP is cleared regularly on certain servers, for the most part the zone is a waste of CPU cycles. A revamped VP would give upper-level guilds another zone to play in, loosening competition just a bit on the crowded servers. Of course, zone revamps take a lot of time, which is something Verant might be short of with Planes of Power looming. Speaking of which...<p><BIG>Power to the People</BIG><p>The unfolding story of the arrival of the Planes of Power continues over on Verant's <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/power/">official site</a>. Yet another Flash movie--this one featuring Karana--sets up the storyline that presumably explains how mortals will be gaining access to the planes.<p>We're now officially less than three months away from the expansion's arrival, leaving ubers under 90 days of Vex Thal farming left to go. Hurry hurry, before all the phat lewtz expire!<p><BIG>To Grief or Not to Grief, That is the Question</BIG><p>Recent changes to the <a href="https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves/">character transfer service</a> are worth noting. Now you can move to and from the PvP servers--excluding Sullon Zek, where the players are far too sullen to be messed with. You still can't mess with the Test or FiVi servers, either.<p>You can't take your gear with you, so it isn't as if you could load up with goodies on a bluebie server and instantly become a PvP goddess, but at least you can give it a shot. If nothing else, moving to a PvP server will make you look all tough--at least until the natives start camping your bind point.<p><BIG>How to Further Ruin Your Server's Economy</BIG><p>Those of you who haven't played with the new features of the Bazaar may want to check out Verant's <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/bazaar.jsp">how-to guide</a> for making cash with the new interface. I didn't notice instructions on how to turn one zone into a 500-player lag fest, but I'm sure they're in there somewhere.<p>Buying items with the Bazaar interface is really, really cool. About the only way it could be improved, in fact, is if you could just buy stuff through the interface without having to withdraw money from the bank and find the merchant you need. I guess that would diminish ye olde roleplaying experience a little too much or something.<p>There may be a downside to the new Bazaar, though. Unlike the GFay/EComm zones and the /auction channel, this zone is a buyer's market. When you suddenly have eight vendors selling the same item, the lowest price determines its value. Patient players used to be able to buy low and sell high, but now even people who would rather pay more for the sake of expediency can zone in, find the lowest price, and snag their item of choice. The exception to this new economic rule seems to be items that are truly rare, where the sellers can keep prices inflated due to high demand.<p>Maybe the markets will stabilize--I'm a writer, not an economist. Hey, if Wall Street can do it, maybe Norrath can, too.
