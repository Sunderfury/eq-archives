Week, that is:<p><B>On Tuesday, February 4th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a brief update. The estimated downtime is 2 hours.</B><p><B>On Thursday, February 6th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 4 hours.</B><p>Why the double duty? I dunno. Maybe ubermob loot isn't entering the game fast enough or something. Or maybe they just wanted two shots at further server snafus. Guess we'll know in a couple days.<p>One of these patch days is my birthday, by the way. I'll let you guess which one.<p><BIG>I Would Dye 4 U</BIG><p>Last week the Legacy of Ykesha site was updated with one of the most talked-about features of the expan--er, extension: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/legacy/f_armordyes.jsp">armor dyes</a>.<p>Honestly, the whole thing is a bit confusing. See, it's not really that your equipment is getting new colors; what actually happens is that you are applying tints to the visible inventory spots on your character. So if you apply a red tint to your leggings, <I>all</I> leggings you wear will get the red tint. Bear in mind that some existing colors will tint better than others.<p>Why not tint individual armor pieces? Well, pretty much every item in game has a unique identifier in the database. I imagine it would be a lot more hassle (and storage space) to add a red, green, blue value to every item in game rather than just to every character's item slots.<p>But the big question, of course, is whether dying armor a good idea at all. Ever since the first time you saw someone wearing full bronze, players have attached a certain mystique to obtaining items with a unique look. Remember how startling it was to see someone in pure Rubicite? Or how cool a warrior looked in full Cobalt? Or when a caster got some new and unique robe? With LoY, those days are gone forever.<p>Granted, the overabundance of items with similar looks has taken away a lot of the glamor anyway. Nowadays you can't tell a shadowknight in Rubicite from one in any number of other armors. But this is due more to a lack of unique textures (especially post-Luclin) than repetition of colors really.<p>Ultimately, I think this cheapens the game more than it adds to it. Especially when you take into consideration all the jackasses who will think they're being clever by combining a pink BP with blue legs and orange shoes and yellow arms. It's like a box of Lucky Charms exploded into Norrath.<p>A better idea, if you must allow dyes, is to at least restrict them within realistic parameters. Keep metal armors in the darker colors from blues to silvers to blacks, leather armors in browns and greens and blacks, and allow more latitude with cloth stuff. Reserve other armor colors for unique drops, thus preserving the glamor of wearing rare items.<p>Pink power rangers may be cute and all, but they're going to interfere with my roleplay experience. (TM) This isn't a LoY feature that I'll be looking forward to.<p><BIG>Hoppin' Down the Bunny Trail</BIG><p>While I don't subscribe to the magazine and have no plans to buy this issue, <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=5481">word on the street</a> is that the current issue of <I>Playboy</I> takes its journalistic integrity to new heights by jumping on the anti-EQ bandwagon only a few months after everyone else did. Check out this teaser in case your place of employment blocks <a href="http://www.playboy.com/magazine/current/index.html">the actual page</a>:<p><B>Online Treachery - Shawn Woolley was a 21-year-old video-game fanatic -- until he shot himself. Playing online games like EverQuest and Ultima, he'd run into grief players -- gamers who use the forums to make opponents' lives miserable.</B><p>/yawn. At least this sounds like it will take a slightly different turn from the typical &quot;EQ is a drug and Sony should be sued&quot; articles, but it's still not really worth our time to read.<p>I was going to really rip on <I>Playboy</I> for doing this, but how can you get mad at a company that does a feature on <a href="http://www.playboy.com/nss/features/catfight/">that chick from the Miller Lite commercial</a>? Especially when they link to the &quot;late night&quot; version of the ad itself? That really is the perfect commercial, you know.<p>Uh, anyway, let me wipe the saliva from my mouth and just point out that Furor and Fires of Heaven are apparently named in the piece, which would mark the first time any EQ player's name has appeared in a dirty magazine outside of contrived letters to <I>Penthouse</I>.  Which are really the only things worth reading in any of those magazines anyway.<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I have an ad to watch again... and again.
