This should make combat mode toggling much more pleasant<br>- Added /mixahead command.  You should only use this command if you are experiencing sounds skipping.  The default value for this command is 8.  Basically, this command tells the sound engine how far ahead to pre-mix your sound.  The larger the number the further ahead it mixes.  So if you are experiencing skipping, you may want to try increasing the mixahead value in small increments (increase it by 2 or 4 at a time).  A setting of about 16 is probably as large as you should need, greater than that will cause your sounds to be noticeably delayed.<p>- Swarm and Reanimation-type pets no longer give exp when killed<br>- Swarm and Reanimation-type pets now properly credit their leader when they kill an NPC<p>- Fixed an issue with /raid that was causing some folks to crash<br>- Fixed a bug that was allowing players without Planes of Power to be invited to /raids<p>- Added minimum and maximum price search parameters for the Bazaar<p>- Fixed a stability issue on the servers</B><p>Many people are <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=25674.topic">pissed</a> that raid functionality is a PoP feature and not something that Verant added to the game for free. While I do agree that VI was a bit unclear for a while as to which way it would be, I think the people who are mad about this are being a bit ridiculous.<p>Why shouldn't Verant be encouraging you to buy a new product? SOE is a business, after all. When they release an expansion, they want their users to buy it. While the planes themselves might be off limits to some casual or lower-level players, they still want their product to appeal to as many of the 450,000 subscribers as possible. And raid functionality is certainly part of that appeal.<p>But even if you don't agree with the notion of supply and demand... <I>just buy the freaking expansion already.</I> For $30 you gain access to a killer transportation system that lets you get to the vast majority of places in the game in the blink of an eye. That's worth the price alone, even if you're a wizard or a druid. Add in the raid stuff, which is useful to mid-level players as well as ubers, and even if you're not planning to set foot in the harder planes for a while the expansion is still a great deal.<p>It's $30. Eat a peanut butter sandwich instead of a McDonald's extra value meal a half dozen times and it's paid for.<p><BIG>VI Are Shameless Socialsts!</BIG><p>Not that raid functionality is perfect, mind you. Raid exp is so negligible as to almost be immeasurable. Instead of the elite group getting all the exp on raids, now everyone gets an equal share of nothing. It's kind of like how the Soviet Union used to work--Verant is forcing Stalinism down your throats! Players of the world, unite!<p>The other big hassle comes into play if you need to switch your group members around. If someone joins a raid group and then disbands, they are still a member of the raid and can't be invited into another group without disbanding from the raid first. Verant needs to change it so dropping from a raid group drops you from the raid entirely.<p>There were also problems with the /raid channel, in that people outside the raid could hear what you were saying. I'm not sure if this was fixed yet, since we've sort of been avoiding using the raid feature in game unless we absolutely have to (read: fights in PoP).<p>Absor posted about <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52435">how the raid functions work</a> with all the new character flags in the planes:<p><B>There are several places in the Planes of Power where you will need a 'raid' force to complete a task. In those cases it is important to actually use the Raids feature. The 'flag' that is given to characters for completing these kinds of tasks is only given to members of the raid. <p>As for those flags, you will be told when you have accomplished a task. But if you forget exactly what you've done there is a sage in the Plane of Knowledge that can divine your past and will tell you what important events you've accomplished, even if you can't remember them. Maybe getting hit on the head less often would help your memory... :) <p>Lastly, there are a few areas in the planes where a character can find themselves alone and unable to proceed. A byproduct of group-specific encounters is that it is possible for a character to miss the end of the encounter (going link-dead, for example) and be left behind when his companions complete the task and are moved out of the encounter area. If the character is incapable of some form of teleportation he might be stuck. There are several items that non-gating characters can obtain before entering these areas, and doing so might be a good idea.</B><p>There are issues with this system that need to be worked out, as in when a raid member goes linkdead or is dead when the flagging happens. But overall, the idea of soul marks is a lot better than more brutally long key quests.<p><BIG>A Grave Situation</BIG><p>The new planes have these handy graveyard areas when you zone in. The idea is that if you die somewhere in the zone, 10-15 minutes later your corpse will be automatically transported for you to the graveyard where you can rez and loot up. This cuts down on corpse recovery time immensely, and actually encourages people to try harder areas of the zone.<p>The problem is that people can train mobs to the graveyard--not an uncommon occurrence. The zone exits are right by the graveyards, which is part of the problem. Also, the graveyards summon your corpse after a set time--whether you want them to or not. This cuts down on the chances of getting a battle rez or of trying again if you fail to kill something the first time. Though of course, the latter may be one of Verant's big reasons for implementing the feature in the first place, as it limits the ability of a single guild to keep a spawn tied up for long periods of time. So while some people want to see the graveyard be an activatable feature, for the sake of the game overall it's probably good as it is.<p><BIG>Yeah, I Know You Can Burn</BIG><p>In a rather <a href="http://www3.quantumlynx.com/barontech/list/sayit.swf">shocking</a> development, wizards actually seem to be agreeing that the nerf to manaburn was <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=22281.topic">a good thing</a> after all. Due to the nature of the fights in PoP, allowing wizards to be chain manaburning stuff would really have made encounters too fast and easy.<p>What? Verant did the right thing? Those wizards must be smoking the same stuff that Furor is!<p>Mages are somewhat less happy that <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=7573.topic">Call of the Hero was nerfed</a> in the planes of Nightmare and Innovation, but I guess they'll just have to accept the fact that anytime this spell can be used to trivialize content, it needs to be dealt with. The spell was a great idea for the game when Kunark came out, but it's simply too exploitable to go unchecked.<p><BIG>T-T-T-T-T-T-Too Much Time on My Hands</BIG><p>While much ado has been made about the fact that getting exp in level 61 and beyond is no cakewalk, everyone knows by now that level 65 characters are turning up left and right on many servers. Most of the people who were 65 within a couple days of PoP's release did so by using ungrouped armies of bots feeding exp to a single character, but many other people are reaching the higher levels through traditional grouping methods.<p>Getting to 65 is not trivial, but it's certainly not impossible, either. I'll admit that I was a bit spoiled by the ease of getting AA points and level 60 exp for a while, and the shock of seeing a slow-moving exp bar again threw me for a loop. But there are still good spots for accumulating experience, and the new planes have areas where there is godly (pardon the pun) exp to be had.<p>So yeah, there will be lots of grinding involved, and yes, anyone who is 65 right now is a freak who plays too much. But it seems that getting those levels won't be so terribly bad after all. Let's just hope that Verant doesn't overreact and nerf exp spots based upon the actions of a few people who powered their way to 65 way too fast.<p>A larger debate is how much those extra levels really benefit you. Parsing is still ongoing, but there are not huge leaps in character power getting to 65 like there were when you got to 60. And of course, many casters are lamenting new spells that don't offer much in the way of innovative character development. Once more people reach the new plateau, we'll have more details for you.<p>But to sum it all up, Planes of Power delivers. It's fun, well designed, and seemingly pretty complete. This is the best expansion launch so far, and PoP is well worth the cash. So if you're still sitting on the fence, just buy it already.
