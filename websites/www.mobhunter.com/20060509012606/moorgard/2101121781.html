This one, though, bodes well for the future:<p><B>&quot;EVERQUEST&quot; VETERANS BRAD MCQUAID AND JEFF BUTLER FORM SIGIL GAMES ONLINE, INC.<p>SAN DIEGO, CA -- January 22, 2002 -- Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler, formerly of Sony Online Entertainment and key figures in the development of the popular &quot;EverQuest&quot; series, today announced the formation of Sigil Games Online, Inc. The new company is dedicated to the production <br>of massively multiplayer online role-playing games.<p>Sigil's official website is set to launch this spring, and the company will begin adding designers, artists, and programmers to its staff later this year.<p>McQuaid and Butler are both creators of the massively multiplayer runaway hit &quot;EverQuest,&quot; developed by Verant Interactive. The game shattered all multiplayer game records after its release in 1999, exceeding all industry expectations and inspiring three top-selling expansion packs.<p>McQuaid is President and CEO of Sigil, and Butler has assumed the role of Vice President.</B><p>No big shock there, but it was nice to learn the company's name and get a peek at their timetable. Maybe Brad will <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">drop me a line</a> and let me know where the name came from.<p>Not to be out done, Sony Online Entertainment is <a href="http://65.207.168.54/candidate/">taking applications</a> for some jobs, so if your life's goal is to create a kinder, gentler EverQuest, this might just be your chance.<p><BIG>A Caster by Any Other Name Would Whine As Much</BIG><p>By now, you've probably heard the <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=21884.topic">story of Bahter</a>, the magician forced to change his name following his acquisition of the title &quot;master&quot; (if you can't figure out why, then you're officially too slow to read this site--please move on).<p>Lest you think the powers that be don't listen, Master Bahter's thread on the wizard board drew an <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=11965.topic&amp;index=58">official response</a> from Verant:<p><B>Before this one gets too far out of hand, I wanted to mention something:<p>After seeing this thread lastnight, I talked to the GM in question as well as one of the Lead GMs. <p>We all agree that this isn't Sir Bahter's fault, and that the &quot;more correct&quot; solution is to add a switch that allows GMs to turn titles on and off. Any name changes due to this, until that point, are only temporary.<p>(This is a feature that we would really like to add in for players as well, but the two gentlemen who'd be doing that are both handling engine/zoning/memory optimizations and drops to desktop at this point, which have to take priority. Unfortunately, it's a more involved change than one might think.)<p>Please don't be too hard on the GMs - They're doing their jobs, and quite well at that. If anything, it's a failing on our side that the need for a switch like this wasn't foreseen when we started adding things in front of people's names.<p>I'm definitely not comfortable with any change we make that forces a need for a person to lose, even temporarily, an identity he's had for quite some time. That's just not fair. We'll find a way get the switch added in the next couple weeks.<p>Best,<p>- Scott Hartsman<br>Technical Director, EverQuest</B><p>As much as we might feel sympathy for that old Master Bahter, we can understand Verant's position on this. Kids play the game, and if they saw someone named Master Bahter running around, they'd never be able to stop giggling.<p>Thus, Mobhunter is officially coining a new phrase: if you have your name changed due to the new title system, you can claim &quot;I've been Master Bahted!&quot;<p>/giggle<p><BIG>Keeping a Low Profile</BIG><p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/">Magelo</a>, the place that lets you make those groovy character profiles with the mouseover effects, is down for a while. Turns out they had a security breach, and someone was able to hack into their system. Profiles should be back next week, they say.<p>The profiles being gone is really just a temporary inconvenience, but as one of our readers pointed out, it could have repercussions you might not have thought of. Do you use the same password for your Magelo profile as you do for your EverQuest account? If so, you better change your password ASAP, because someone could have all of Magelo's usernames and passwords at this very moment.<p>You should change your EQ password periodically, anyway. But if you used Magelo, this is all the more reason for you to do so--right now.<p><BIG>At Least Norrath Isn't Having a Recession</BIG><p>Slashdot <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/01/23/2131259&amp;mode=thread">posted a link</a> to a report on Norrath's economy, written by a gentleman named Edward Castronova. In this academic paper, Castronova compares the financial system in EverQuest to that of the real world, and comes to some very interesting <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=294828">conclusions</a>:<p><B>The nominal hourly wage is about USD 3.42 per hour, and the labors of the people produce a GNP per capita somewhere between that of Russia and Bulgaria. A unit of Norrath's currency is traded on exchange markets at USD 0.0107, higher than the Yen and the Lira.</B><p>Sure, EQ might have its share of problems, but at least we don't have to stand in line for bread and vodka while LFG in Sebilis.<p>Speaking of economics...<p><BIG>Break Out the Plow, Farmboy</BIG><p>Even though Verant has cracked down on the selling of accounts and items on eBay, we all know it still happens. Sure, it can get your account banned if you're caught, but people continue doing it because they can still rake in the cash. Not as much as the days when you could get $100+ for an FBSS, mind you, but it's still pretty good.<p>It seems someone is finally taking the mixture of in-game economics with real-world cash flow to the next level. A company called MindArk is <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/16/technology/column_gaming/">developing</a> a new MMORPG called &quot;Project Entropia.&quot; In an industry first, MindArk is not charging a monthly fee to play the game. How can they do it? By selling weapons, armor, and other items for real cash.<p>That's right, gentle reader. You purchase items from vendors and other players with an in-game currency called PEDs--which you can presumably ring up on your real-life credit card. MindArk intends to make their money by having players buy items from their in-game stores, but you might stand to make a buck, too. You can trade in your PEDs for real cash when you like, so if you buy low and sell high, you just might just turn a profit. There could also be in-game casinos a few years down the road... &quot;Entropia: Shadows of Vegas&quot; anyone?<p>How will MindArk keep players coming back for more? Well, items will decay--a game feature that 90% of EQ's player base (myself included) actively despise. But because items wear out, players have to keep buying more. You see where I'm coming from here.<p>So will &quot;Project Entropia&quot; be a hit? Maybe, but I doubt it. The EverQuest economy works the way it does at least in part because there are hundreds of thousands of diverse people who play the game, compared to a relatively small percentage of item farmers. Entropia is geared towards the latter, so when the l33t powergamers realize that the only people playing the game are other l33t powergamers trying to make a quick buck, the game will die. I'm no economics major, but at least I understand supply and demand.<p>The real test, of course, is content. If MindArk can deliver compelling content that doesn't involve spending RL money--and the graphics and sound are top notch--then they have a fighting chance. With a supposed launch date in the second quarter of this year, I guess we'll know soon enough.<p>Should Verant follow suit? If there was a vendor in East Commonlands selling a Cloak of Flames for $75 US dollars along with other high-end goodies, would you buy? Would Norrath's economy be brought to its knees, or would the effect be minimal? Feel free to post your thoughts below.
