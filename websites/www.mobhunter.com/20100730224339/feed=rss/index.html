		<title>Save the Avatar, Save the World</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve heard about Blizzard&#8217;s RealID system, and have seen many of the opinions against the upcoming change to WoW&#8217;s forums. I think the move is lousy too, for most of the same reasons others have stated. I think ultimately the change is dangerous, both to the customers and to the health [...]]]></description>

		<title>PAXing East Coast Style</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Today I, as well as a throng of coworkers, descended upon the first incarnation of PAX East. Though there wasn&#8217;t an official 38 Studios presence (no booth or big announcements this year&#8211;sorry!), our execs were nice enough to give the team the day off to attend opening day of the festivities. First off, it&#8217;s great [...]]]></description>

		<title>Speaking at VR 2010 Conference</title>
		<description><![CDATA[On Tuesday, March 23, I&#8217;ll be speaking at the IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 Conference, taking place in nearby Waltham, MA. The panel is titled &#8220;Design for Experience?!&#8221; and if you look at the list of speakers, I am clearly the dumbest guy in the room. I can only assume they had some quota of locals [...]]]></description>

		<title>Alienware M11x &#8211; A Practial Review</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I began researching netbooks&#8211;small laptops aimed mostly at Web browsing&#8211;several months ago. I do a fair bit of traveling, and while I love my current machine, lugging the 17&#8243; beast through airports has never been what I would call a treat. Not to mention the fact that a large notebook is completely useless on a [...]]]></description>

		<title>Industry Reset Buttons</title>
		<description><![CDATA[The hot industry trend is evangelizing social games. Many took up this habit fairly recently, playing catch-up at shows like DICE last week. The Kosters of the world have been atop their social soapboxes for years. The aspect I find interesting is that a number of, shall we say, developers of a certain age (such [...]]]></description>

		<title>Wisdom Worthy of Dusting Off This Blog to Restate</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Truer words have never been spoken. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb here, and assert that setting a realistic scope is one of the most difficult challenges an MMO producer will face.&#8221; Lum understates his point. He shouldn&#8217;t. Scope is a balancing act. When making an MMO that seeks to evolve the genre [...]]]></description>

		<title>My Favorite Music of 2009</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Many of my favorite bands didn&#8217;t release new records this year, so I&#8217;d have to say I was a bit disappointed with 2009 overall. Still, there were plenty of gems worth purchasing. It&#8217;s also interesting how many live albums showed up on my list. I enjoy live albums when bands add something new to the [...]]]></description>

		<title>I Was Not, in Fact, Mugged in London</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Yesterday one of my web email accounts was compromised and someone sent a mass email to my contact list saying that I had been mugged in London and was deprived of all my cash and credit cards, and that if someone couldn&#8217;t wire me cash I would be thrown out of my hotel and forced [...]]]></description>

		<title>Stop Copying Our Totally Original Designs!</title>
		<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s a widely known fact that Blizzard invented the achievement-based fantasy MMO, and one of WoW&#8217;s producers has given an interview to PC Zone magazine explaining why copying this unique blueprint is a bad idea. When World of Warcraft sprang wholecloth from the minds of Blizzard back in 2004, there simply had been nothing like [...]]]></description>
