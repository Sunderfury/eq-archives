Well done.<p>You can read the <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/news/2003-05-07.php">full story</a> for yourself and view the cleared Council chambers, as well as the first screenshot of the Avatar of Earth. The loot is nice, but basically on par with items from the other elemental gods. The BP, for example, is the plate equivalent of the leather tunic that Fennin Ro drops, albeit with much higher AC and a bit more weight (which would lead one to assume that there is a chain version out there as well, though I don't recall ever hearing of one dropping). That ring is nifty, aside from the fact that it was clearly intended to be monk-only loot. Hopefully SOE fixes that in the next patch (wink wink). One could easily argue that loot from the Avatar of Earth should be considerably better than that of other elemental gods because of the difficulty involved, but we'll leave that debate for another time.<p>As you can imagine, details on exactly how the victory was achieved are being kept confidential. You can't blame the guild for protecting its strategy. Nothing has been said as to whether anything about the encounter changed to make it more winnable, but given the fact that guilds on other servers have been fighting the Council as well, we'll assume that Afterlife simply beat everyone else to the punch.<p>Sadly, there are no Plane of Time screenshots yet. Why? According to Thott, entrance to the next plane isn't possible for everyone in Afterlife due to a flagging bug. Once again, the flaws of the flag system prove to be a roadblock. We trust that a fix will arrive soon and all of Afterlife will have access to Plane of Time as they deserve.<p>The debate is over; the encounter is beaten. Now we get to find out for real whether Time is ready or not.<p><BIG>*** Updates ***</BIG><p>Afterlife's <a href="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/">homepage</a> has been updated with shots from Plane of Time. The issue that prevented some of them from entering the zone was <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=55792">addressed</a> in a post from Absor:<p><B>Some of the folks that recently completed The Rathe Council encounter were unable to enter the Plane of Time. The requirements for entry are complicated, and those people simply missed a step in the quest that gains them entrance (just an NPC that they needed to talk to). We've talked to them and explained what they missed, and they have been able to gain entry by completing the missing step. <p>However, we are going to modify the quest steps a bit to make them simpler so that this shouldn't happen in the future.</B><p>Apparently the Rathe Council encounter's most recent tuning a few nights ago did contribute to the victory, though the fight remains extremely difficult.<p>A second guild, Stormhammer's <a href="http://townrebels.org/">Township Rebellion</A>, have now also taken down the Council. Expect to see other guilds do the same very soon.<p>All in all, this is very good for the game, and I'd expect to see many disenchanted high-end players who had taken a break or retired come back for a crack at the now-killable Rathe.
