		<title>When Universes Collide (In a Good Way!)</title>
		<description><![CDATA[The playable demo for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning (our fun and gorgeous single-player RPG) drops on January 17 for PC, 360, and PS3. If you play the demo as well as the demo for Mass Effect 3 (another fantastic RPG you may have heard something about), you unlock awesome items for your characters. Why is [...]]]></description>

		<title>My Favorite Music of 2011</title>
		<description><![CDATA[This is a big freaking list. Either I&#8217;m getting worse at narrowing down my choices for favorite albums, or maybe it really was just that good a year. There were a ton of releases I really liked, with an exciting blend of new talent along with reliable veterans making some of their best records in [...]]]></description>

		<title>Unveiling a World</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;d imagine most people still aware that this blog exists realize that I have been working for 38 Studios for the last five years (yeah, it&#8217;s been that long!). We&#8217;ve been very quiet about the specifics of what we&#8217;re doing, other than that we set out to make an MMO, acquired an excellent RPG team, [...]]]></description>

		<title>Start Spreading the News</title>
		<description><![CDATA[Don&#8217;t get around much anymore&#8211;in blog posts, I mean. But hey, as long as I can stay ahead of Hartsman (who, as a big-money executive, does no actual work and thus lacks any excuse for not blogging), I figure I&#8217;m doing okay. Anyway, I&#8217;m headed down to New York Comic Con this week for a [...]]]></description>

		<title>Moorgard Returns to E3</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m in California for the first time in years to attend E3. I haven&#8217;t been to the show since the height of its excess, before it was neutered. Though still manic and bombastic, it feels noticeably less chaotic to me. I have memories (now fond, at the time not so much) of being hoarse each [...]]]></description>

		<title>Designing for Three-Year-Olds</title>
		<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s very easy for game designers to come up with lofty, complex ideas. This is especially true for people who take a support role on one project and suddenly find themselves in charge of something on another title; they get the impulse to put their stamp on everything, to show the world how clever they [...]]]></description>

		<title>My Favorite Music of 2010</title>
		<description><![CDATA[On the whole, 2010 was a fantastic year for new music. A lot of my favorite bands released albums, and a whole crop of new artists showed up with awesome material. It was a struggle for me to name a single Album of the Year; for the first time since I&#8217;ve been doing this feature, [...]]]></description>

		<title>Back, Hacked, Do It Again</title>
		<description><![CDATA[This morning, I received an email saying my Battle.net account password had been changed. After resetting the password and logging in, my characters were naked. A petition to a GM followed, and this evening I got mail that my items had been restored--though my account was now locked.]]></description>

		<title>There Are No Truths&#8211;Only Perspectives</title>
		<description><![CDATA[The EA Louse blog is all the rage these days, and I&#8217;m sure anyone who visits this site will have encountered many observations on its content already. I can neither confirm nor deny the author&#8217;s assertions, though of course over the years I&#8217;ve heard my share of stories about the dark secrets of various game [...]]]></description>

		<title>Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling</title>
		<description><![CDATA[I have not given up on blogging, despite all appearances to the contrary. It&#8217;s just that, well, I&#8217;ve been busy. Lots of great stuff going on at work. As you may have heard, we announced our first product and have been talking about it at various shows. I know many of you are anxious for [...]]]></description>
