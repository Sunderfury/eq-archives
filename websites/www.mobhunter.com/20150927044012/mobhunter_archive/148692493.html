Ever wish you could fill another server's auction channel with mindless ramblings about your fascination with midget porn? Well, now you can do both, thanks to the wonders of <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=30002.topic">serverwide chat</a>.<p>It seems that as an unmentioned feature of the new user interface, Verant added the ability to send tells to people and join chatrooms on other servers.<p>To join a chat room on another server, the format is:<p><B>/join [ServerShortName].[ChatRoomName]</B><p>To send a tell to someone on another server:<p><B>;tell [ServerShortName].[PlayerName] message text</B><p>I don't have a list of all the abbreviations for servers handy, but you should be able to figure most of them out.<p>For example...<p>;tell veeshan.furor hi kin i have phat lewtz plz?<p>Something tells me that Verant is going to have to implement a larger ignore list.<p>There was some speculation that this functionality might not have been intended to go live, and that it would be fixed in this morning's <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/network_status.jsp">emergency patch</a>. I tried it out just a little while ago, however, and it's still working.<p>No idea what that emergency patch was intended to fix, by the way.<p><BIG>Doing Windows is Fun</BIG><p>When talk of a customizable user interface first crept up, I sort of yawned. Big deal, we can add textures to the windows and make them whatever size we want. No big whoop.<p>I couldn't have been more wrong.<p>Not only can you totally redesign the look of the windows you have, you can add or subtract features to your heart's content, or even make totally new windows. The folks over at <a href="http://newui.technosapien.net/index.htm">EQ Interface</a> are posting a wealth of UI redesigns, complete with screen shots and instructions on how to make them work. So if you felt left out because you can't program in XML, don't worry. Just about anybody can have the interface of their dreams.<p>Along with new windows, you might want to play around with the /viewport command. Though the description in the patch message was a bit confusing, there are some interesting <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=29906.topic">tips</a> floating around on how to make it work for you. Basically you can make part of your screen area black so that you can put all your windows there and not obscure your view of the game. If you remember, back in the day you used to be able to do something very similar with Ultima Online.<p>If you'll excuse my VAKish gushing for a moment, the new UI and Bazaar functions just kick major ass. This patch ranks right up there with the very best stuff Verant has ever done. Even though we had to wait a long, LONG time for them to arrive, they were very much worth the wait. Kudos to the teams that worked on making the UI and Bazaar so freaking cool.<p><BIG>The Little Rogue's Room</BIG><p>One neat feature of the new UI is the character select screen, where you can walk around in a room with all your toons in it. Each class has a differnt room to explore, decorated with appropriate scenery.<p>Well, it turns out that rogues have something extra in the room that befits their class. There's a <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=24549.topic">secret panel</a> on the floor that you can click on to open which reveals a room full of roguish gear. No, you can't equip it, but it is a cute little extra that VI threw in.<p>You may now resume the ancient debate about rogues being Verant's pet class. Want further fuel for that silly old fire? Okay, how about <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselaboratory.showMessage?topicID=2363.topic">new weapon procs</a> added to the spell file that might be the long-promised revamp of the poison skill? Here's a few of the effects so far:<p><B>Confine - decrease movement (max 55%)<br>Corruption - decrease hp by 55, dot for 66/tic over 5 tics - 385 total<br>Dip Resist - lower all resists (max 10)<br>Destroy Mind - reduce mana (max 60 per tic, for 5 tics)<br>Molten Silver - 175 dd<br>Remiss - lowers hate (max 500)<br>Sluggish - lowers hate (max 110), lowers dex (max 120)<br>Strike - 75 dd<br>System Concussion - 75dd, stun (0.0 secs)<br>Vein Rot - dot for 36hp/tic over 15 tics - 540 total<br>Waste - lower dex (max 60), lower hate (max 110), lower str (max 120)</B><p>Supposedly these effects will have a fifteen-minute duration, which is certainly better than the way poison currently works (which is why the skill hardly gets used these days).<p>Of course you know that I was kidding about rogue's being Verant's pet class. Everyone knows that monks are. But rogues spend so much time poking people that once in a while you can't help poking back.<p><BIG>The Latest Newbie Zone</BIG><p>One of the surprise changes that crept into the patch was that <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11632.topic

">new items</a> were dropping off a few giants in Kael. It turns out that King Tormax and the Statue of Rallos Zek (and for a while Vindicator, though thankfully that was fixed in a zone patch) have begun dropping fragments of a first brood dragon talisman that can be turned in to Jaled's shade over in Dragon Necropolis for a key to Sleeper's Tomb.<p>Ubers and semi-ubers who have been killing dragons for a while now to get the keys have mixed feelings on the matter. Clearly this is a move on Verant's part to get more people into Sleeper's Tomb. As they did through various revamps of the north wing of the Temple of Veeshan, Verant is making some of the Velious high-end content easier so that more guilds will see some of the sights that were previously reserved for ubers alone.<p>The net effect of this change will be that more people than ever will have primal weapons, even on servers where the Sleeper has been awakened. Thus, even more previously high-end content will become slightly more trivial. Why would Verant do this? Perhaps to push more guilds towards the end-game content of Luclin, since competition will be heating up for the Velious stuff. Or maybe Verant is designing the content of Planes of Power with primal weapons in mind.<p>Another possibility is that Sleeper's Tomb is due for a revamp, and Verant just wants to give more people access. There will be an <a href="http://64.37.156.24/eventview.jsp?o=49885">ST-related event</a> on the Legends server today, though it's unknown whether this content will eventually move to the ghetto servers. Once the Sleeper wakes up, the zone becomes a lot less interesting (not that it's all that compelling after a couple visits anyway), so a redesign to make things more lively wouldn't be a bad idea.<p>While they're working on dragon-related zones, maybe they could get around to that long-promised revamp of Veeshan's Peak. Please please please please please.<p>In any event, you can expect to see &quot;camp check&quot; messages flashing in Sleeper's Tomb any day now.<p><BIG>New Faces Everywhere</BIG><p>Western Wastes became a bit more cluttered after Wednesday's patch, with <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=11630.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25

">dragon corpses</a> and some giant-aligned hunters dotting the snowscape. Clearly some new quest is brewing, but nothing concrete has been turned up yet.<p>Plenty of other zones are seeing new residents as well. <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=5353.topic">Permafrost</a>, <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=29958.topic">SolB</a>, <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=5355.topic">Fear</a>, and <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=11648.topic">the Hole</a> are all experiencing a housing shortage due to these pushy mobs moving in. The Norrath Housing and Dungeon Development Authority (NHADDA) has already been alerted. <p><BIG>Bards Busted, Buddy</BIG><p>Yeah, yeah, we know... it's no shocker that bards had some ability not functioning properly. But Absor doesn't usually <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000634.html">comment</a> on it, since he figures that bards are just used to it by now. This time, however, he did:<p><B>Singing Mastery is designed to improve the bard's ability to sing songs.<p>Instrument Mastery is designed to improve the bard's ability to play instruments.<p>Now there is a bit of possible confusion when we start talking about songs that are instrument based when the bard is not using an instrument. At that point the bard is singing and instrument song, and it really becomes a matter of taste as to whether Singing Mastery or Instrument Mastery should apply. We've decided to base it on the skill used, not whether an instrument is in hand. So Singing Mastery applies to all Singing skill based songs and Instrument Mastery applies to all instrument based songs, whether or not the bard is using an instrument at the time.<p>No, these two abilities were never meant to overlap. It was a bug when Instrument Mastery gave a bonus to songs that use the Singing skill.<p>That bug was fixed this patch. Instrument Mastery no longer affects songs that use the Singing skill.<p>What we've decided to do is increase the amount that Singing Mastery affects Singing skill songs by 50%. That should go in the next time we patch.</B><p>Bards, of course, have a <a href="http://pub105.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=14541.topic">few things to say</a> about that, and not all of them are singing a happy tune. You might say this change has hit a sour note with the community.<p>Jeez. Bard puns are just too darn easy.<p><BIG>Pretty New Spell Gems</BIG><p>Absor also stopped by Dev Corner to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000633.html">explain</a> the color code system for the new spell gems:<p><B>With all of the new spell gems and with the change to the interface, it seems inevitable that we'd get a few spell icons or a few gem colors crossed.<br>For example, I hear that Nektulos Portal has the Gate spell icon. We might want to change that to match the other group teleport spells.<p>And Pillar of Frost seems to have an orange spell gem and it should probably be green.<p>Here's a list of the gem colors and what they should mean, for reference:<p>Yellow: Personal - spells that you can only cast on yourself.<br>Red: Single Target - spells that affect (and require) a single target.<br>Blue: Point Blank Area of Effect - spell affects an area centered on the caster, but the caster is unaffected.<br>Green: Area of Effect - spell affects targets in the area centered on the target.<br>Orange: Area of Effect Rain - spell affects the area around the target, often in a continuing fashion.<p>The distinction between Green and Orange is pretty narrow.<p>So if you see something like this let me know (just reply to this thread). I'll gather a list.</B><p>Spell gems that actually make sense? Wow. Maybe even I will be able to figure out how to play a caster now.
