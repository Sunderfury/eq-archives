				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a few months of convalescing after the big layoff, I now begin the next phase of my career. I have accepted a position at Blizzard Entertainment working on World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting step for me. Blizzard has a proven track record of shipping quality products, and as a longtime lover of MMOs, it&#8217;s a thrill to go to work on the most successful title my favorite genre has ever seen. It will be a huge honor and challenge to try to make my own mark on the game. An added bonus is reuniting with a bunch of my former 38 colleagues who also work at Blizzard. This is going to be fun!</p>
<p>For reference, the title of this post refers to the big milestones in my career since moving into game development. Phase one was starting at SOE back in 2003. Phase two was helping found 38 Studios in 2006. Phase three was my return to SOE in 2012. Phase four begins now, in May of 2015.</p>
<p>Many folks would be happy to have enjoyed just one of those experiences, so I count myself as very fortunate to be given the opportunity to continue my journey. Thanks for all your support over the last few months, and I hope I can count on it going forward.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first heard of Kickstarter, the proposition seemed straightforward and awesome. A smaller developer has a great idea and huge passion but can&#8217;t find a publisher willing to front their modest budget, so they fire off a campaign and let the market decide whether it&#8217;s worth backing. The developer has a team in place ready to go, knows the tech required to pull it off, and really only requires the cash. Seems ingenious. And frankly, since that isn&#8217;t the realm of game development I spend my time in, I really didn&#8217;t give it a lot of thought beyond that.</p>
<p>But after some high-profile Kickstarter debacles in which funded projects failed to deliver or required more than their initial ask, crowdfunding has come under increased scrutiny. As it should be&#8211;when you contribute to a campaign, you are an investor, and you shouldn&#8217;t be throwing your money into a black hole. Certainly the stumbles have caused me to rethink my initial perception.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was generally understood all along and I&#8217;m only just now getting it, but clearly Kickstarter is often less about &#8220;Money is the final piece I need to make this game, can I please have some?&#8221; and more about &#8220;We have this awesome idea and need your money to have even a chance of making it.&#8221; Which can be okay, so long as the expectation of funding hope rather than enabling completion is clear up front.</p>
<p>The problem is, it&#8217;s rare to see a campaign present itself that way. For me, a lot of it comes down to the promises being made. If you&#8217;re part of the team that has planned the project out and just needs $500k to make the game, then it is very prudent (and fun) to add stretch goals for what happens if you actually bring in $600k, $700k, and so forth. But if your ask is essentially for seed money to attract the <em>real</em> investors, then that initial crowdfunding goal is about making a vertical slice or demo, and anything beyond that should really only have the stretch goal of, you know, making a deeper, more polished demo. When you look at the perks being offered to higher-level contributors on such projects, you tend to see the same vanity items and feature creep common to just about every campaign.</p>
<p>Again, maybe I&#8217;m just naive for only now realizing this. But if the following point isn&#8217;t clear to you already, I hope you at least take away this one thing from my post: Giving a million bucks in seed money to keep a developer&#8217;s lights on while they seek out the $20+ million they <em>actually</em> need to make their game is <em>orders of magnitude</em> more risky than funding a three-person team that only needs a bit more cash to make it to the finish line. Yes, the world is full of rich investors, but&#8211;trust me on this&#8211;finding the right people willing to invest in making games (especially MMOs) is no easy feat. In the meantime, <strong>your</strong> hard-earned green is feeding those developers. This is high-risk investment, folks. Don&#8217;t do it unless you haveÂ  money to lose.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding asks like this can be done responsibly and in a way that frames expectations correctly, but transparency&#8211;especially upfront&#8211;is absolutely crucial. Know what you&#8217;re getting into before you give anyone your money is the foundation of smart business. Seeing a developer with passion is great and something we all want to encourage, but make sure that passion has a clear and achievable plan behind it. Cool ideas are common and cheap; it&#8217;s proper execution that&#8217;s rare and expensive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the news of Leonard Nimoy&#8217;s passing, I feel as though a tangible piece of my childhood is gone. The deaths of DeForest Kelley and James Doohan were tough, but Kirk and Spock were the heart of my favorite show. Nothing else, not even Star Wars, had as profound an impact on my life as the original Star Trek series.</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s almost inconceivable now, I watched those reruns of Trek when it meant sitting on the floor in front of our tiny TV (must have been 17&#8243; if we were lucky) and manually turning the knob to one of the four or five channels we could pick up from the airwaves. There wasn&#8217;t a lot of sci-fi or fantasy being shown, apart from a few cartoons and Sunday morning monster movies. Those Trek episodes were my lifeline into a world I wanted to believe in, one that rescued me from the trials and fears of being a skinny, nerdy kid. They let me dream.</p>
<p>I knew every episode by name. I could recite many of the lines word for word. I still retain a surprising number of those tidbits, even if I haven&#8217;t seen some of those episodes in years.</p>
<p>Back then, it was pretty much all I had. Many beloved series have come and gone in the years since, most all of them with higher production values than what Trek could manage. But none surpassed the heart of those original episodes, and few would have anywhere close to the influence on my life and work.</p>
<p>While of course I never met Leonard Nimoy personally, he always seemed like a wise, gentle man who tried to do good in the world. He wanted others to learn from his mistakes and not repeat them. And he served as the cerebral anchor of the Trek cast, being very patient with fans who obsessed over that iconic character of Spock for nigh five decades. Such was his impact.</p>
<p>His passing reminds us that the rest of the crew won&#8217;t be around forever, either. Let&#8217;s treasure them while they&#8217;re with us, and remind them how much they&#8217;ve meant over the years.</p>
<p>Rest well, Mr. Nimoy. You&#8217;ve earned your place amongst the stars.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keen (hopeless EverQuest sentimentalist that he is!) wrote up a nice piece on how <a title="He's keen, that one." href="http://www.keenandgraev.com/2015/02/19/quests-should-enable-players-to-tell-their-own-stories" target="_blank">quests should inspire player-driven stories</a>.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s dubious to hold up EQ as a model for how quests should work. While certain of them can be romanticized, long would be the parade of people who quit the game over the very Journeyman&#8217;s Boots quest he cites. And it&#8217;s just as valid to look at the orc belts and other turn-ins like it as grindy time-killers.</p>
<p>But I do agree with the spirit of what Keen is trying to say: That quests should not be the content of a game; they should be the spark for the true content, which is player interaction.</p>
<p>The original epic quests are a good example. For the most part, their execution was spotty&#8211;poorly written, relying on guessing more than logical deduction. But what they did was bring a whole cross-server community together. We were racing other servers to be the first to solve the quests, and class members from rival guilds who wouldn&#8217;t ordinarily interact were sharing leads and ideas.</p>
<p>I think the role of the content designer should be to provide compelling hooks for player storytelling. And by compelling, I mean both interesting and well-executed. Players should be drawn in by the quest and incentivized to undertake it, but the quest itself should be mere manipulation to get players interacting. It might be through cooperation, competition, or some kind of symbiotic relationship where both sides benefit in different ways.</p>
<p>I also agree that quests can, and generally should, be simple and straightforward. Designers often fall into the trap of wanting to tell a grand tale, when it&#8217;s usually much clearer and more effective to use quests to tell micro-stories that let players draw their own conclusions. Weave these together through consistency, continuity, and quality, and you can create a powerful tableau that tells a much bigger story.</p>
<p>To make those micro-stories work, you need to invest in quality worldbuilding, which I&#8217;ll talk about in a future article.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes people assume that, because I specialize in narrative design, I think every game needs to be saturated with story. But in fact, I look at it from the opposite point of view: What is the minimum amount of story needed for the game being made?</p>
<p>Excess story is a waste of resources and potentially gets in the way of play. Hey, I&#8217;m a gamer too, and I don&#8217;t like clicking through needless dialogue or extraneous cut-scenes any more than you do. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t love well-done dialogue and cut-scenes, because when used correctly, they are powerful tools that can enhance your experience. But I like to focus on finding the most concise path to conveying the most effective story. And often that means doing less, not more.</p>
<p>Of course, some types of games demand a big, sprawling narrative. The <em>Mass Effect</em> series wouldn&#8217;t be what it is without complex dialogue trees and detailed cinematics; they&#8217;re part and parcel of the experience. But <em>Frogger</em> wouldn&#8217;t be any more fun if you understood the protagonist&#8217;s childhood or explored the world&#8217;s political struggles; it&#8217;s enough to know you&#8217;re playing a frog who needs to cross roads and rivers to get home. Building games like <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Landmark</em> are another type that benefits from having a loose narrative at best, allowing the player to imagine as much (or as little) story as they like.</p>
<p>The nature of the sandbox MMO is to eschew formal narrative in favor of free-form play. That doesn&#8217;t mean your world shouldn&#8217;t have a rich and detailed backstory. On the contrary, I&#8217;d argue that sandboxes benefit from deep histories even more than structured narrative games do, because it provides a wealth of story for players to find on their own. Bits of story are embedded in the world awaiting discovery instead of being served up on a quest-journal platter.</p>
<p>But it all comes back to finding the right fit for the game you&#8217;re working on. As much as creating the tale itself, the role of a narrative lead is to pare the story down to its minimalist core. Part of being a memorable storyteller is being a judicious editor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When 38 collapsed, I was deeply depressed. In addition to the usual stresses&#8211;finding a job, providing for your family, the self-doubt&#8211;I was plagued by the nagging sense of work left unfinished. Sure there was a game still in progress, but even more than that was this rich universe of stories that, aside from <a title="Ghosts aplenty" href="http://amalur.wikia.com/wiki/Amalur_Wiki">Reckoning</a>, were going to go untold. Though the story of Amalur was in every way a team effort, I took it personally. It felt like my life&#8217;s work was ripped away, utterly out of my control. It still sits on some hard drives in Rhode Island, songs left unsung. And though it still haunts me, I&#8217;ve come to terms with it.</p>
<p>Being let go from SOE/Daybreak is a different feeling. Yes, all the usual stresses are there, but at least the project I was on continues. I respect and like the designers still on the project, and I know work I did will see the light of day, even if it ends up being different from how I might have done it. Things are in good hands. And yeah, I regret that I won&#8217;t be there in the trenches as those stories come to life, but at least I can point to a body of work (the <a title="Novellas and short stories." href="https://www.everquestnext.com/media?category=ebook">EQN ebooks</a> we&#8217;ve released) as tangible evidence of my contribution. I can make peace with that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m starting the job search again, but I&#8217;m in a much more positive, healthy space than I was last time. While looking for work isn&#8217;t what I&#8217;d call an ideal process, things could be a lot worse. Trust me.</p>

I&#8217;d been back for about two-and-a-half years following 38 Studios&#8217; collapse, and they were very kind to offer me a position on Landmark and EverQuest Next.

<p>Jobs come and go. Some are terrific; others less so. But relationships endure. No matter what line of work you do, if you work hard and support those around you, good things will come your way. It&#8217;s proven true across the various careers I&#8217;ve had.</p>
<p>I poured my heart into the story for EQN, just as I did for Amalur before it. Norrath is in good hands, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what Daybreak achieves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=816" target="_blank">last year&#8217;s post</a>, I admitted that I was finally buying more music digitally than on CD. Unsurprisingly, that trend has only escalated in 2014. I bought digital music exclusively except in three cases: 1) it&#8217;s an artist I have a particular fondness for, and I consider their music to be an artifact I wish to own, 2) the CD was cheaper than the digital files, or 3) there was an in-store exclusive version with bonus tracks I desired. That last one is particularly powerful, and Target has proven particularly skilled at grabbing exclusives with a wide variety of artists.</p>
<p>I spent less and less time in record stores, as Amazon has become my shopping destination of choice. What&#8217;s more, their Prime Music library is utterly amazing, and well worth the price of Prime in and of itself. While browsing through pages of thumbnails lacks the tactile pleasure of flipping through music bins, I find the thrill of coming across a great old record and adding to my library nearly as satisfying. And it&#8217;s not just ancient stuff; they have many releases from 2014 that you can grab and enjoy, including several mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado, my list of favorites from another great year of music:<span id="more-835"></span><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Like It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interpol &#8211; <em>El Pintor</em> </strong>- Sometimes a band needs to be away for a while to remind you how much you miss them. Interpol has always lived in the house that Joy Division built, but at their best they have a potency and optimism that belies their darker influences. <em>El Pintor</em> wasn&#8217;t a departure from the band&#8217;s established sound, but that felt to me like a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Adams &#8211; <em>Ryan Adams</em></strong> &#8211; When he released <em>Gold</em> in 2001 and <em></em>Rock N Roll two years later, Adams was poised to become one of the most distinctive songwriters of his generation. I remember reading an interview in which he talked about the high volume of songs he wrote, and how he could release album after album of new material. I thought that sounded like magic. Well, it turned out that while he kept the promise of regularly releasing albums, he rarely managed to reach the heights of those earlier milestones. Still, I buy every record Adams puts out, because I know he&#8217;s capable of greatness. Happily, this year&#8217;s self-titled record harkens back to those classics, and I think it&#8217;s his best effort in a decade. If not quite <em>Gold</em>, it&#8217;s still a valuable addition to his legacy.</p>
<p><strong>Angel Olsen -<em> Burn Your Fire for No Witness</em></strong> &#8211; Olsen&#8217;s record is the darling of many critics&#8217; lists this year, and for good reason. It harnesses the fire of early PJ Harvey while offering more depth. Snarling at times, but the songs have a warmth to them as well. Often stark and harrowing, yet Olsen never drives the listener away.</p>
<p><strong>Chromeo -<em> White Women</em></strong> &#8211; If money was no object and you wanted to book a band to play a high-concept disco party, you&#8217;d hire Daft Punk. But if you wanted to stage a fun, sexy disco soiree, then your money would be better spent on Chromeo. This duo is unabashedly a playful throwback to an earlier age, and in so doing may wind up closer to the spirit of what disco was about in the first place. A great party record, especially if you want to watch your guests get freaky.</p>
<p><strong>Dum Dum Girls &#8211; <em>Too True</em></strong> &#8211; Jangly guitars over female vocals and a bouncy beat describe most of the songs on <em>Too True, </em>a solid turn from this Sub Pop band. At times singer Dee Dee Penny&#8217;s vocals recall Chrissie Hynde or Shirley Manson of Garbage, with a confident, cocky snarl befitting a rock star. Many of the songs project a real sense of fun, making this a really enjoyable album.</p>
<p><strong>Death From Above 1979 &#8211; <em>The Physical World</em></strong> &#8211; After a prolonged absence since their last release, DFA came back with guns blazing this year. Their music is a blend of rock and blues and dance that reminds me of Urge Overkill&#8217;s brief heyday. A band that&#8217;s not afraid to cut loose, but they keep your feet firmly on the dance floor. A welcome return.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Henry &#8211; <em>Invisible Hour</em></strong> &#8211; Every Joe Henry record feels like an artifact, crafted with the same care with which Ken Burns makes a documentary. While Henry usually stays true to form&#8211;quiet songs about flawed characters who might have fallen straight out of a John Steinbeck novel&#8211;there are always so many nuances to his music that it benefits from repeated listening. <em>Invisible Hour</em> is another work of art well worth your scrutiny.</p>
<p><strong>Jack White &#8211; <em>Lazaretto</em></strong> &#8211; It always felt to me like the White Stripes were a little overrated, and I&#8217;ve often rolled my eyes at Jack White&#8217;s many Twitter feuds. But there finally came a point where I could no longer deny that the man knows how to make a kick-ass record. <em>Lazaretto</em> is dark and mesmerizing, and just a lot of fun. Maybe I need to go back and give his earlier work another shot.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Messersmith &#8211; <em>Heart Murmurs</em></strong> &#8211; This Minnesota songwriter consistently sells out local venues but deserves a much wider audience. His last several releases have been rock solid, evoking the best of smart, catchy pop music with honesty and depth. A collection of love songs, <em>Heart Murmurs</em> plays with expectations to weave tales of many different types of love. It&#8217;s cleverness that never feels anything less than genuine.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Love It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>St. Vincent &#8211; <em>St. Vincent</em></strong> &#8211; Although I was not overly fond of 2012&#8217;s collaboration with David Byrne, I think the pairing re-energized St. Vincent&#8217;s Annie Clark. Her new record is bombastic and bold, as evidenced by her enigmatic performances on Letterman and SNL. Always offbeat, the latest collection embraces that distinctiveness with a driving set of songs. This record challenges the listener and rewards the effort.</p>
<p><strong>My Brightest Diamond &#8211; <em>This Is My Hand</em></strong> &#8211; Yet another female artist who operates under a <em>nom de plume</em>, MBD&#8217;s Shara Worden is a musical chameleon who can effortlessly shift from chamber to dance music with any number of genres in between. She similarly slinks between emotions in her lyrics, from playful to poignant. Every number is a candidate for a contemporary piece on So You Think You Can Dance&#8211;which, in my book, is high praise.</p>
<p><strong>Hospitality &#8211; <em>Trouble</em></strong> &#8211; Pretty much any band fronted by a smoky-voiced female singer is going to merit a listen from me, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ll fall in love with it. At first, I thought Hospitality might end up in a pile of mediocre releases, but something about <em>Trouble</em> stuck with me. It was probably the Wire-like drone of &#8220;Last Words&#8221; that hooked me, but soon the other songs lured me in. I&#8217;ve returned to this album again and again over the course of the year, and enjoy it more with each visit. Give it a chance and you&#8217;ll mine unexpected depth.</p>
<p><strong>alt-J &#8211; <em>This is All Yours</em></strong> &#8211; This band&#8217;s sound is really hard to pin down. Ranging from electronic to prog to world music, the vocals are often as mercurial as the melodies. But sprinkled in among the many influences are songs that weave their way into your subconscious. Heady stuff, but with a personality that simultaneously welcomes and challenges the listener without being off-putting.</p>
<p><strong>FKA twigs &#8211; <em>LP1</em></strong> &#8211; At turns alluring and unsettling, FKA twigs (ne Tahliah Barnett) defies labels and genres. Sometimes when an artist creates music so resistant to categorization, it comes across as forced. Here, it almost feels like a challenge, as if Barnett is daring you to try to put her in a box. There are hints of classic soul paired with ominous whispers that recall Tricky at his best. Certainly a compelling artist I can&#8217;t wait to see develop further.</p>
<p><strong>Damien Rice &#8211; <em>My Favourite Faded Fantasy</em></strong> &#8211; A songwriter standing onstage and singing his or her heart out is certainly nothing new. But Rice does it like a surgeon, his music stripped to the bare minimum and his lyrics wielded like a scalpel&#8211;deft and precise yet mercilessly sharp. In the eight years since his last album, he&#8217;s lost none of his edge, and cuts most deeply into his own psyche. Every Damien Rice record has moments that stun me with their perceptiveness and vulnerability, so personal that the listener can&#8217;t help but gaze into the mirror as well.</p>
<p><strong>Black Keys &#8211; <em>Turn Blue</em></strong> &#8211; The ever-reliable Black Keys (along with ace producer Danger Mouse) could have simply turned out another collection of radio-ready singles in the vein of their previous mega-seller <em>El Camino</em>. Instead, they released a more brooding, personal record that addresses the challenges and demons which often accompany fame and success. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; there are still hits aplenty, such as the throbbing &#8220;Fever,&#8221; but <em>Turn Blue</em> is not defined by them so much as by introspection.</p>
<p><strong>Warpaint &#8211; <em>Warpaint</em></strong> &#8211; With songs trippy, slow, and sexy, Warpaint weaves an alluring spell. Fans of the xx will find a lot to like here, with spare beats and echoing vocals that pull the listener in. Though this LA ensemble has been around for about seven years, it&#8217;s now that they&#8217;ve found their footing. Thoroughly modern, though at times I hear a (very welcome) hint of the Cocteau Twins or Lush.</p>
<p><strong>TV on the Radio &#8211; <em>Seeds</em></strong> &#8211; While I&#8217;ve found all of TV on the Radio&#8217;s albums enjoyable, &#8220;joy&#8221; is the word that immediately springs to the forefront when listening to <em>Seeds</em>. The songs abound with catchy hooks, and an infectious fervor runs through the record. This is rock at its most spirited and fun, but crafted with satisfying skill.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; Gotta Have It &lt;&lt;<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Afghan Whigs &#8211; <em>Do the Beast</em></strong> &#8211; Often when a band is on hiatus for a decade and a half, they come back either diminished or transformed into a new incarnation that is all but unrecognizable. Such is the fear when an act as beloved as Afghan Whigs rises again. Happily, <em>Do the Beast</em> is in every way a worthy successor to previous epics like <em>Gentlemen</em>. From aggro teeth grinders like &#8220;Metamoros&#8221; to slow burners like &#8220;Algiers,&#8221; the Whigs are capable of conveying a startling range of aural sensations. Welcome back, fellas. Stick around a long, long time.</p>
<p><strong>Lana Del Rey &#8211; <em>Ultraviolence</em></strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s possible that Lana Del Rey&#8217;s carefully crafted persona is talked about more than her music. And in fact, that persona is part of the appeal. In my mind, Del Rey is a construct, a theater piece, as much of a disguise as the members of KISS in their makeup. Her lyrics are high-concept costumes, her songs scenes of a play. Whereas <em>Born to Die</em> told the story of a young ingenue discovering that sex can be used as a tool or a weapon,Â <em>Ultraviolence</em> portrays a more seasoned, cynical character who has achieved success and stands at the height of her powers. Gone are the hip-hop trappings of her previous effort, replaced by rock-tinged torch songs. I hope Lana Del Rey delivers a compelling third act, closing her character&#8217;s story as an aging beauty who reflects on her failings as well as her triumphs. Time will tell how this story plays out, but I&#8217;ll be watching from the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard Cohen &#8211; <em>Popular Problems</em></strong> &#8211; Considering the countless words written about Leonard Cohen in the many decades of his storied career, it&#8217;s unlikely that I&#8217;ll come up with anything original to offer here. All I will say is that, of all his contemporaries, Cohen&#8217;s work feels the most unashamedly human. Our triumphs and our flaws are all on unflinching display. <em>Popular Problems</em> teems with sex and blues and doubt, like all of Cohen&#8217;s best work. Released on his 80th birthday, it feels wizened and reborn all at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Elbow &#8211; <em>The Take Off and Landing of Everything</em></strong> &#8211; Elbow is another group that is hard to classify, bringing Peter Gabriel-esque eclecticism into a modern context. But the songs are the true stars here, with lyrics both introspective and candidly observant. &#8220;I live and die by the hot and cold in strangers&#8217; eyes&#8221; croons singer Guy Garvey, an apt perspective on the life of any artist. The band has been together for 20 years, and the cohesion is evident, yet somehow the music feels fresher than ever. I&#8217;ve played this record countless times over the year, and its depth is always satisfying and astonishing.</p>
<p><strong>First Aid Kit &#8211; <em>Stay Gold</em></strong> &#8211; It may seem improbable for two sisters from Sweden to craft such perfect country-tinged pop songs, but that&#8217;s exactly what has happened on <em>Stay Gold</em>. In fact, I&#8217;m not certain there is anyone else on the planet, in any genre, making harmonies this beautiful. Each sister&#8217;s voice is lovely on its own, but together they are almost hypnotic, startling in their power and warmth. As if that weren&#8217;t enough, their songwriting has improved with each album; their previous effort, <em>The Lion&#8217;s Roar</em>, was replete with memorable gems, but their latest disc is exceptional from start to finish. When I listen to this record, my mind is instantly transported to a vast golden plain where the notes soar like the wind. Utter perfection. My record of the year.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also terrified, because I&#8217;ll be on stage in front of several thousand people to talk during a small portion of the keynote speech. I love doing panels, but standing in the spotlight of the big stage is another thing altogether. It&#8217;s early in the morning on Friday, so with any luck I&#8217;ll be too tired to be nervous. Sadly, though, Vegas and luck don&#8217;t usually go hand in hand for me.</p>
<p>These shows are a ton of work, but seeing the reaction of the fans makes it all worth it. I know that sounds cliche, but it&#8217;s actually true. So come say hi if you&#8217;re there, I&#8217;d love to chat!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A look back at my time on Vanguard, and my feelings now that the game has gone dark.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At 6pm PST on July 31, 2014, the servers for Vanguard: Saga of Heroes went dark. I wasn&#8217;t on the team that originated the game at Sigil, but I served as its Creative Director for a number of months upon my return to SOE in 2012.</p>
<p>It was a series of unlikely events that led to me working on Vanguard. I&#8217;d just spent the last five-and-a-half years on Copernicus, which was built on fresh tech and the best art assets an MMO had ever seen. After four months on the job hunt, I&#8217;d accepted a design job at a studio focused on console and mobile titles when I got the call inviting me back to SOE.Â  Though I was looking forward to trying my hand with other types of games, MMOs are my first love, and the idea of reuniting with old friends in San Diego was a big draw. I knew my ultimate destination would be the EQNext team, but I was asked to first help with an attempt to revitalize Vanguard. After weighing my options, I returned to San Diego determined to do my best for a game with one of the most storied histories in the genre.</p>
<p>Working on Vanguard was never easy. It was an aged title by the time I got to it, and although faster PCs allowed it to run better than it had back at its 2007 release, it was still plagued by technical problems resulting from architectural decisions made early on. Its content was a mess, ranging wildly in quality from inventive to abysmal. There were significant bugs everywhere, many of them years old. And while the design tools put a lot of flexibility into developers&#8217; hands, its many idiosyncrasies intersected with a database awash in the detritus of years of half-finished work. Every bug we fixed seemed to come with an unintended side-effect. Change the name of an item and some unrelated field would get zeroed out. Adjust one stat and other variables would be altered without telling you. Lack of version control meant you had to hunt through screen shots or ask players what an item used to be like before it got unintentionally nerfed. There were a lot of days when I would literally sit with my head in my hands, flummoxed at how some feature or another could possibly have been implemented in such a convoluted way.</p>
<p>And yet, I grew to love the game.<span id="more-822"></span></p>
<p>This was due almost entirely to the small but passionate group of players who managed to look beyond the mess and find the beauty in Vanguard. I don&#8217;t mean how the game looked, although Vanguard did have some of the loveliest vistas you could find in an MMO thanks to its sprawling open world (environments generally looked better from a distance than they did close up). No, these players found beauty in the challenge and adversity that had quickly whittled Vanguard&#8217;s audience down from respectable box sales to a small crew of diehards.</p>
<p>These hardy souls stuck with the game through long periods of neglect when literally no new content appeared. Sure, they had their moments of bitterness, and rightfully so, but their bond with one another outweighed the negatives. They did their best to recruit new players to the game, but poor performance and lingering bugs meant not a lot of those visitors stuck around.</p>
<p>The free-to-play renaissance gave Vanguard a chance. A team was built up and the game was dusted off. Work was done under the hood to support the FTP model, and attention was paid to the starting experience in order to make new players coming in a bit more welcome. Veterans became hopeful&#8211;or at least cautiously optimistic. I came on board after the game went free and some content updates had already rolled out. We had a tech director who knew his stuff, a veteran producer, a talented art director, and a team of people who wanted to see Vanguard succeed. Many of them had been there during the Sigil days and had long wanted to give the game the chance it deserved.</p>
<p>For a time, our chances looked good. Being on Steam brought us attention and some new faces. The in-game store had periods of decent sales. We had a promising trajectory to build upon.</p>
<p>Sadly, it didn&#8217;t last.</p>
<p>In the years that Vanguard languished, the MMO landscape had kept moving. When Vanguard was released, there were still only a handful of active MMOs on the market, but it didn&#8217;t take long before new massively multiplayer titles were crawling out of the woodwork. Players had more and more choices all the time, many of them taking the genre in different directions (or at least featuring significantly higher production values) while Vanguard stood still. It was hard to attract players when there were so many newer, shinier alternatives.</p>
<p>Ultimately there were just too many gaping holes to patch. A major revamp of the network code came too late to help build an audience. And with the state the game was in, adding polished content was simply too costly and time-consuming given the size of our audience. The team shrank as most of us were shifted to other games, and I joined the team making EQNext and Landmark.</p>
<p>While sunsetting a game is inevitably going to cause hurt feelings among players, the truth is that SOE gave the game a lot of chances. Most other companies would have pulled the plug after the initial downturn in subscriptions. Instead, the game was kept alive for over seven years, and fans who wanted a challenging open world MMO had a place to call home for an awfully long time.</p>
<p>By any objective benchmark, Vanguard was never a great game. But the love we have for MMOs isn&#8217;t about benchmarks&#8211;it&#8217;s about heart. And the game&#8217;s promise, its potential, took hold in the hearts of a core group of fans. They loved the experience despite its flaws, and found those moments of beauty to cling to. In the end, Vanguard was about community and camaraderie, about pride in overcoming adversity together. And it&#8217;s that kind of abiding passion that makes me so proud and excited to work on MMOs, because no other type of game has quite the same potential.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleased to say I logged in for the game&#8217;s final hour. I helped summon people to an unreleased zone to show them a bit of what might haveÂ  been and got the chance to say farewell to many friends. It was bittersweet, to be sure, but I choose to remember the sweet.</p>
<p>Rest well, Vanguard. You&#8217;ve earned your place among the stars.</p>
