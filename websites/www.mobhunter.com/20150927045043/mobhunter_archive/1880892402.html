While the druid spell line worf forms connot be casted in doors.<p>I know druids is an our door class, but animal forms should at least be related. <p>Like both should be able to cast in both indoors and outdoors. Or both spells can only be casted out doors.<p>Kaidebx<br>46 paladin<br>the nameless<p>Kaidebx<br>44 druid<br>morrell thule</B><p>The druid wolf forms have a foot speed increase included, and it is for that reason that they cannot be cast indoors, as no spell that enhances character movement can be used by player characters indoors.<p>Conformity isn't really enough of a reason to restrict bear form, since it does not have a component that increases the movement of the target.<p>Alan
