<html><head><title>A Day in the Life</title></head><body><h1>A Day in the Life</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-04-29</p><BIG>All I Get From You Is Talk Talk</BIG><p>Csenicier sent me an instant message this afternoon informing me that a local talk radio station was doing a segment on EverQuest. It seems a fair number of folks were calling in to pick on our poor defenseless game.<p>My first instinct was to call in, give my credentials (if writing for Mobhunter could ever be called that), and stand up for EQ players by showing we are not all a bunch of time-wasting freaks who live in our parents' basements. At the same time, I could probably stir up interest in Mobhunter and would certainly draw some visitors to the site.<p>Then I heard that the mother of the suicide case from Wisconsin was going to call in. She proceeded to pontificate about how evil the game is, talking about her son and the lengths she went to in order to keep him from playing--even to the point of calling the authorities to stop him. The host was moderate and didn't seem to agree with her conclusions.<p>Still, all of it gave me pause. How do you reason with emotion like that? If I called in, how would I come off as anything but an unsympathetic video game freak who only cares about playing in a silly fantasy world?<p>In the end--despite the outrageous number of VAK points I could have racked up by defending EQ on the radio--I didn't call in. Because it doesn't really matter if we defend our little hobby to the masses or not; what matters is that we play to have fun, and that we balance our real lives and take care of our real-world obligations.<p>Yeah, I know... you're expecting Stan to walk out and say, &quot;You know, I learned something today...&quot; I'll spare you any further weepy rambling. Just play the game and have fun.<p><BIG>The Ol' Bait 'n' Switch</BIG><p>Just to make Monday more interesting, Absor gave us a humorous little snippet today. First he said <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000554.html">something</a> about Sullon Zek points:<p><B>As some of you have noticed, the points pages for Sullon Zek hasn't been accurate for a little while now. It has been updated. We're sorry for the hitch.</B><p>To which the 41 people who play on Sullon Zek replied &quot;Yee-haw!&quot; while the other 453,298 people who play EQ simply yawned.<p>A couple hours later, Absor came back and added:<p><B>Well, just after I post this I am informed that we are still having trouble with the stats.<p>I'm sorry about that. We'll get them up as soon as we can.</B><p>All of which still isn't really newsworthy, but it is kinda funny. Plus, we like to point out whenever Absor screws up.<p>Hey Alan, is alchemy working yet? MUAHAHAHAHA!<p><BIG>Moorgard Visits the Court of Pain</BIG><p>A few patches back there was a new quest added to the game (the Whistling Fists quest) that results in a pretty nice weapon which also serves as the Iksar precursor to the monk epic. As a gesture of fairness to the &quot;soft skins,&quot; Verant also made it so human monks could raise their faction in Cabilis enough to be able to undertake the Iksar quests. Like most faction work, that usually entails killing a few thousand things, turning in some body parts of said few thousand things, and slowly building up the necessary faction.<p>But every once in a while there develops something we shall politely refer to as &quot;a faction loophole&quot; through which someone can raise a certain faction much easier than intended. Such is the case for the aforementioned soft skins.<p>It turns out the folks at Monkly Business have turned up a <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=931.topic">method</a> of obtaining Cabilis faction very quickly. It involves a love story between a beautiful she-troll in Rathe Mountains and a lonely Iksar trooper in Lake of Ill Omen. If you pass love letters (cleverly disguised as knives, since their love affair is taboo) from her to him, the happy tropper awards you massive pro-Cabilis faction hits with no negative hits at all. In fact, several backpacks full of stacks of these love letters is all it takes to allow even a much-despised soft skin entrance to the Iksar capital.<p>Before you roast me for giving away some big secret, take a gander at all the &quot;OMG do this before VI nerfs it&quot; posts in the thread. Yeah, it's most likely an oversight, so if you don't give it a shot before the next patch, you've only got yourself to blame. Note that just about anyone who gets themselves non-KOS to the trooper (or who has the sneak skill) can do the quest, though your max faction may cap differently. But even if you don't care about faction, do it for the sake of those star-crossed lovers. They make an awfully cute couple.<p><BIG>Rant of the Week</BIG><p>If you're up for a bit of light reading, you might check out this <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=960">essay</a> by Kreugen of Fires of Heaven. It's a pretty interesting summation of the problems with the Luclin expansion from the point of view of the high-level player.<p>Granted, this diatribe is concerning a portion of the game that probably only 5% of the playerbase will ever have to deal with, but there are some valid points made. And from personal experience, let me assure you that the long dungeon key quest is not something that's going to be making my list of the things we want to see in future Verant products.<p>By the way, thanks for the excellent submissions on that topic. Keep them <a href="mailto:support@mobhunter.com">rolling in</a>.
