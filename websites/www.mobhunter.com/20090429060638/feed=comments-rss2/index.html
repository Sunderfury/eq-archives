		<description>I find it interesting the thought of being able to judge 'talent', she says she knows lots of talented designers but how do you even judge that?  I knew a lot of horrible designers including at least one horrible one that is well known because while not a good designer, he is a great salesperson.  

Then, as far as blogs go, regardless of who writes it, Moorgard, Carrottop (one word or two?), or Jesus, you have to evaluate the ideas objectively and take what you think is worth taking away from it.  As with any job, you have to continually evaulate yourself and your ideas to get better, if you assume you, or anyone else has all of the answers then you probably suck and are just oblivous.</description>

		<description>By the time a MMO gets to the beta phase all of the major gameplay mechanics should be pretty much cast in stone. Beta should really be for stress testing more then anything.

I was fortunate to be a part of the WoW Friends &amp; Family alpha program and believe me when I say this, WoW was very polished then. It was fun, breathtaking, engaging and simply off the charts as a MMO experience. It was light years ahead of EverQuest and DAOC at the time.

By the time your  MMO reaches beta it should be ready for the public. As Steve has said, the public will not tolerate a MMO that is not polished and ready to be shipped even at the beta stage. How many times have we seen major MMO companies violate this cardinal rule in the past few years?

Ship it when it's ready or don't bother shipping it. Tell the publisher and the marketing departments to go jump in a lake if they tell you otherwise.</description>

		<description>I read through Cuppy's article and some of the responses it generated, and I'm reminded of the "how do you like them apples" scene from &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymsHLkB8u3s&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="nofollow"&gt;Good Will Hunting:&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chuckie: Are we gonna have a problem here?

Clark: No, no, no, no! There's no problem here. I was just hoping you might give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the southern colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War, the economic modalities, especially in the southern colonies, could be most aptly described as agrarian precapitalist.

Chuckie: Let me tell you something -

Will: Of course that's your contention. You're a first-year grad student; you just got finished reading some Marxian historian, Pete Garrison probably. You're gonna be convinced of that 'till next month when you get to James Lemon. Then you're going to be talking about how the economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740. That's gonna last until next year; you're gonna be in here regurgitating Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know, the pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization.

Clark: Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social -

Will: "Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth"? You got that from Vickers' "Work in Essex County," page 98, right? Yeah, I read that too. Were you gonna plagiarize the whole thing for us? Do you have any thoughts of your own on this matter? Or do you, is that your thing, you come into a bar, read some obscure passage and then pretend - you pawn it off as your own, as your own idea just to impress some girls, embarrass my friend?

Clark: [looks down in shame]

Will: See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years you're gonna start doin' some thinkin' on your own and you're going to come up with the fact that there are two certainties in life: one, don't do that, and two, you dropped 150 grand on a f***in' education you could have got for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library!!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Who's the better designer in the industry today?  Someone who can quote from Raph Koster's "A Theory of Fun" or Richard Bartle's "Designing Virtual Worlds" or someone who can come up with come up with original ideas?  Are original ideas even &lt;a href="http://clockworkgamer.com/2007/09/05/great-designers-steal/" rel="nofollow"&gt;that great an idea&lt;/a&gt;?  Even if they are, does it matter how great the ideas are that a designer can come up with if they can't actually communicate or implement those ideas into the context of a game?</description>

		<description>It would be Ghoulbane, from EQ again, because I watched a friend agonize for hours waiting for the Frog King to spawn, and hoping this time it would drop Ghoulbane.
It never did...

I agree that EQ's loot was so rare that you would remember every item. But, I must also confess that I don't have the time or opportunity to spend an entire night waiting for a named mob to spawn 2 times, while doing nothing...

Yes, it gave you downtime to speak with people (I spent hours in DAoC dungeons grinding and talking, and it was fun because we talked), but also, you knew that you needed to be connected at least 4 hours in a row to have the feeling to do something...

I'm not saying WoW is better. I did quit WoW because I did not feel the slightest thing for my character and was bored before hitting level 30. But I'm not sure EQ is the panacea either. Or, it's not a panacea for grown-ups :S.

And, concerning remembrance, [Quality] [Attribute] [Slot] of the [Other Bonuses]  makes for some poor naming, as every item is so close...
Compare that to Soulfire, or Ghoulbane ? These are names you want to remember...</description>

		<description>"Another reason is that, despite the many articles I’ve written and all the interviews I’ve given, you probably don’t actually know what I do for a living."

That applies to pretty much everyone that works on a game.  Dev working on the UI layer is very different then network for example.  This is another example of why game credits have little to no value.

Even when one is on the inside it is typical to not know what many people do, even when they are on your team.  Internal communicating what works and does not work is a large challenge for an organization.  Communicating the same type of information to customers just adds to that challenge.  At some point there will be a common vocabulary that will set in but that is still being created.</description>

		<description>I think Raph's #11 hits home with me the most and can sum up how I view developer/designer blogs in general.  Not that they're all wrong and/or crappy designers/developers, because the ones I tend to read typically aren't, but that what you're looking to  do is learn from the mistakes of others, especially of those who have been successful in the past.  We can always look at a failure and call it a failure, but to read how the person(s) involved created that failure and their thoughts during the process can be the most valuable element to truly refining theories and providing designers with the tools needed to make better games.</description>
