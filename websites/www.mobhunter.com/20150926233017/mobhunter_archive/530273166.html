Zee Patch!</BIG><p>First, of course, the message itself:<p><B>August 14, 2002   3:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>** Bug Fixes **<p>- Fixed a bug that allowed items to be placed in the wrong equipment slots<br>- Fixed a problem that some folks had with polygons and clipping using the Matrox Parhelia card<p>** Spells **<p>- Changed Luclin port spells to be usable from anywhere<br>- Added new Druid and Wizard transportation spells for locations in Luclin<p>** Items **<p>- Removed the cap for items that granted bonus mana<br>- Bricks of Black Acrylia are now stackable<br>- Plains Pebbles are now stackable<br>- Casserole Dish Sketches are now stackable<br>- Yttrium Sleeves and Leggings now have a plate armor appearance.  They are also no drop<p>** New User Interface **<p>- New Interface Window: The Compass!  Press Alt-D to activate it.  The higher your Sense Heading skill is, the more responsive and accurate the compass is<p>- Fixed the fatigue percentage Label to show 100% when you are not fatigued at all<br>- Clicking to add new items to a stack in your inventory will now stack those items into the inventory rather than onto the cursor<br>- Fixed a bug that was causing some people to lose items when looting too quickly<br>- Tracking window no longer shifts to the top every time an NPC dies<br>- Training window no longer only shows the first digit of the amount needed to pay for training<br>- Fixed the bug that was causing left clicking during mouselook to target<br>- The 'hits mode' menu and filtering for it is done, including the options for normal, abbreviated and number/miss only for the six main melee filters<p>- UI Skin Creators: We added the following EQType labels:<br>	71 = Current AA pts available to spend<br>	72 = Current exp % being assigned to AA<br>	73 = Last Name of the player<p>- Alternate Skin Users: You may need to return to the default interface until the skin that you are using has been updated to work with the latest client.  The addition of the new Compass window as well as some other changes may cause problems with skins for older patches of EverQuest.  If you experience odd interface behavior or crashes, please try /LOADSKIN DEFAULT to return to the default skin.<p>** Bazaar **<p>- The Bazaar Search Window is resizable (added in an earlier patch)<br>- PCs can't beg or pickpocket from NPC's and PC's in the bazaar (added in an earlier patch)<br>- The Trader drop down box is now sorted alphabetically<p>** Alternate Advancement **<p>- Priests and intelligence casters now have the Combat Stability and Natural Durability Alternate Advancement abilities in their Archetype<p>** Miscellaneous **<p>- Reduced the faction hit for the final turn in on the Wizard Epic quest<br>- Implemented key rings.  Certain keys will be placed on your key ring when you use them (like clicking on the appropriate doors or locks).  The keyring is a part of the character, not a space in inventory.  To find out what keys you have just type /key and the game will give you a list<br>- Moved the safe point in Marus Seru to a somewhat safer spot<p>** From Neriak **<p>An uncharacteristic silence descended across the Imperial District of Neriak, city of the Prince of Hate's children.  Not so much an absence of sound, more the oppression of pure silence; an almost tangible potential crackling in the air itself, as a quiet before a tumultuous storm. <br> <br>Nobles and commoners alike stood motionless in the streets, a look of confused expectation upon their upturned faces.  The ghouls guarding the entrance of the Dark Academy chittered briefly to one another before melting into the shadows.   <br> <br>All eyes looked upon the Dark Tower of Sorcery, it's smooth stone walls seeming to almost pulse with a power from within.  Darkened windows and oriels looked out upon the silent city of the Tier'dal, imparting an impression of amused malice. <br> <br>Silence... interminable, suffocating silence...  instantly broken by a deafening, mind-rending thundercrack, reverberating from the cavernous walls of the city, shaking the very foundation of every building with immense force.  Blinding luminance, lancing forth from every aperture in the tower, burning the eyes of those foolish enough to look on, whilst the thundercrack pained each listener's ears. <br> <br>Then, as soon as the cataclysmic burst had come, it vanished.  The ringing in the ears of every dark elf within the streets below slowly subsided, to be replaced by a lone, maniacal stream of laughter echoing throughout the city from the Dark Tower's summit...<p>** Head over to EverQuestLive.com for the rest of the story **</B><p>So what's all this talk of exploiting? Absor and Scott Hartsman have been <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000650.html">pleading and warning</a> folks not to exploit bugs in the game lest they face dire consequences. They were referring to the very first line of the patch message--items being equipped in the wrong slots. According to a <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=30737.topic">post</a> on the monk board, people in a high-lag situation found they could equip <I>any</I> item for <I>any</I> class in <I>any</I> slot, meaning a rogue could have a warrior breastplates on her feet, monk pants on her head, etc. As you can imagine, this would lead to some pretty darn buff characters--assuming one had access to the right toys.<p>The solution to the exploit:<p><B>After the patch occurring at 3 AM PDT Wednesday August 14th, any character level 11 and over who is wearing items that cannot be legally equipped by the character, or are equipped in illegal slots, will suffer an immediate duel-style death to forcibly reset their inventory.</B><p>Yeah, that's one way to clear a person's inventory. Hopefully some accounts will be warned or banned, too. Crime never pays, children.<p>The addition of a compass is cool, and making it work off sense heading means that even twinks will actively work to raise their skill.<p>The changes to the Luclin port spells are, of course, pretty major. Besides adding ports to Grimling Forest, Dawnshroud Peaks (fix the zone crash problem, please!), and Twilight Sea--as well as a Nexus port for druids--Luclin port spells are usable from anywhere.<p>Why the change? Go read the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/eqfiction/lore.jsp">roleplay justification</a> over on the EQLive site (it's the continuation of all that stuff at the end of the patch message), or check out the short answer here:<p><B>&quot;Excessive transportation and use of the lunar quadroliths has indeed had some noticeable effect, as postulated. The thaumaturgical constraints that have directed all of our displacement attempts towards that focal point of the lunar mass are...&quot; </B><p>It seems former Star Trek writers have found jobs at Verant.<p>Why strip away the roleplay aspects of making the moon hard to get to? Well, they only made partial sense anyway. Sure, getting to and from the moon was time consuming... unless you were bound there, in which case neither your friendly translocating wizard nor your naked body seemed to have any trouble finding its way to your bind point. Chalk this up to the current Verant team's efforts to decrease idle time spent traveling and buffing and so forth. As it stands now, Verant has no reason not to decrease the scion portal times to five minutes or so, or even to change them to be port-on-demand.<p>Casters should be happy with a few changes in this patch. Not only is the mana cap gone, but Combat Stability and Natural Durability were added to their list of AA skills. Um, what the hell? As if casters don't melee enough as it is! Soon wizards will be main tanks, and your local uberguild will have to write several rants about how completely unbalancing that is to the game. In reality, casters might survive just a bit more and will have 10% more hitpoints to convert into mana.<p>The key ring deal is pretty big. No longer will soulbound keys be cluttering your inventory and causing a hassle when you die and have to put them away again. The trick is that you have to use them before they actually go onto your ring. For the most part this isn't an issue, but it seems a trip to Veeshan's Peak will be required to get that one onto my ring.<p>Which means... VP raid, anyone?<p>The big question is how long people will really want to wait before trusting the new system enough to actually destroy the keys after they land on your ring.<p>Hopefully now the item-poof-while-looting bug is fixed, and wizards should be happier with the faction change on their epic quest. The item stacking thing is fixed, and more hitsmode options were added. All in all, a pretty darn good patch.<p>As ever, post any hidden changes/nerfs below.<p><BIG>Absor Said WHAT???</BIG><p>Casters Realm posted their <a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4467">transcript</a> for the Community Feedback forum at the Boston FanFaire. Absor answered all kinds of questions, including the standard Ragefire complaint:<p><B>The real problem is there are just too many Clerics who want their epics and too many people willing to help the Clerics get it because the item is so desirable. Triggered spawns aren't really something we want to do, as they will allow too many epics into the world. It's not really something we have anything in plan to change right now.</B><p>He also gave a little hope for bored enchanters in Planes of Power:<p><B>The problem with Enchanters is that Mez is so powerful. In PoP you will see a more diverse range of encounters. It won't be all raid, or all experience, or all quests. It won't be just PoP which addresses things like this, that's really what our Caster Balance is about. But PoP will give players a large range of activities to do.</B><p>Mez too powerful? Well, it probably should never have been the cornerstone of the class then, I guess. I'd expect that class abilities will be seeing some major overhauls in EverQuest 2.<p><BIG>Gen-erally Con-ducive to Fun</BIG><p>A reader named Lionkin sent us some additional info on happenings at GenCon last weekend. Besides the planes of Innovation and Justice that were <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,6023274,00.html">mentioned</a> by GameSpot, Verant also showed the Plane of Decay. Here's Lionkin's summary:<p><B>Decay looked quite nasty, and was filled with Bubonic ratmen of various types, a lot of shaman, necro, and SK types, all appeared to be level 60ish and were sometimes packed half a dozen or more to the rooms and tunnels which looked the insides of intestines.  Decay also had puslings which were zombie-ish type humanoids with who knows what nasty abilities.  At one point there was a room with a Pus Lord individual, very large and fat.  It would seem your anti-disease gear and spells are in order for this plane.</B><p>Sounds like fun. There was also a bit more on what goes on in Justice:<p><B>Apparently you fought the Seventh Hammer as some sort of test. The Seventh Hammer of course wielded a giant hammer, and was hitting at times for 1900+.  Whether this is the damage that will go live with the mob, I have no idea.</B><p>Ouchies! Gues I won't be main-tanking that bad boy.<p>Finally, necros and shamans and such will like this news:<p><B>On a separate but interesting note, in a discussion with Scott Hartsman, EQ's Technical Director, it was learned that he is dedicated to making DoT stacking work.  Given the oppurtunity, he mentioned he'd like to get this in even before PoP was released.</B><p>/cheer DoTs. Now I want a weapon that casts one!
