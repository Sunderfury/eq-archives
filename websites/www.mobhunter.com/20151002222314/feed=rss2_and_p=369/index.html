This definition is very limiting.


Average people doing extraordinary things makes them heroic.

Everyone is an ordinary human that can also do extraordinary things.

Given the correct opportunity everyone can be extraordinary.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reading this topic brought back memories from a variety of MMOG&#039;s for me, and taking a moment to highlight the common thread to these events was not a problem. For me it has and always will be about doing things a bit different then i perceive situations to be designed. I find the fun moments of feeling both heroic and badass to be in organized chaos. A few examples that immediately came to mind:

Hunting in the dreadlands, but instead of finding a safe spot we chose to sit right in the middle of the traffic as well as have two pullers, a druid rooting for cc and an enchanter mezzing. This gave us non stop action, more mobs then we knew what to do with but somehow tested us and increased our skill.

Instead of taking the easy route and quad kitting umborus toilers in Maiden&#039;s Eye a shaman friend would join me and we would snare pull as many as we could and dot nuke them, imagine 15 - 20 or so coming at you and having to keep track of where each of them were health/doT wise an inevitably having a few break free and having to adjust.

Heading into Sunken Temple before either wow expansion with just a 60 druid, 53 shaman, and 47 warlock and clearing the place.

Unfortunately most players I have come across are not interested in attempting these types of things as it has become all about numbers and efficiency. Why would they try somethign different when there is already &quot;THE&quot; place and &quot;THE&quot; way to get the best possible XP per hour.

EQ for me was about enjoying the journey, everything since has been about  the mad dash to get to the top.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with Jason regarding city of heroes. I wouldn&#039;t say that it made me feel heroic so much as it made me feel like I wasn&#039;t a peon. The power curve was on a higher scale. Rarely, if ever, did you fight one thing. Far from it, it took scores of minions to take you on. I think that is a good system to build from and could work. You don&#039;t have to be a hero but you do get that &quot;bad ass&quot; feel from fighting bigger/more enemies. Nobody will ever feel like a stud by killing a big rat unless you happen to be a smurf, anthropomorphic mouse, or one of the children from &quot;Honey I Shrunk the Kids.&quot;

At the same time, I also agree with Steve in his opinion about what the insane reduction of downtime has done to MMOs. Lets face it, every game has gone to extremes to be &quot;not Everquest.&quot; Which is a shame in some ways. Most modern MMOs don&#039;t tolerate soloing, they make sure you can be by yourself from one to cap. Not only that, the system has evolved from where soloing was possible to soloing is desirable. I love to group but frankly in Warhammer it seems to be counter productive to fast leveling. I can do more solo, which is a tragedy considering its an MMO.

I know I&#039;m a relic of a system long since gone but I miss some of those hard features. You should -always- get better rewards in a group. Not barely so, but obviously. More experience, more loot, more money and more socializing. MMO used to mean you played with others. Now, for a lot of players, it just means you have a convenient chat channel with your friends while you solo. At least Warhammer more or less mandates it for RvR. That doesn&#039;t change the PvE zones though.

And that, however, is a tangent and I apologize. It would be very hard to feel like a hero but not too bad to feel &quot;big.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[City of Heroes was great at achieving that &quot;heroic&quot; feeling.  Running in to a group of bad guys, cutting it close and using &quot;inspirations&quot; (not potions or powers or whatever, but honest to God inspiration!) to pull victory from the jaws of defeat.  The problem with City of Heroes is that is what the entire game was.  One heroic fight to the next, the story, the context, your character... nothing else really mattered.  Heroic fights, repeat.  Its the only game I ever played where I burned out from having too much excitement because there was no substance under it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is nothing that makes me feel more heroic than fighting a large group of mobs and winning. The Olthoi Horde Nest in Asheron&#039;s Call did that for me. I would be pinned into a corner by dozens of Olthoi only to end up with their bodies all over the floor and me still standing. It was great! The other times are when I decide to go somewhere for no reason. I recently made the run to Rivendell in Lord of the Rings Online at too low of a level and it is certainly an unforgettable trip.]]></description>
