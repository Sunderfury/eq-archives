<html><head><title>Jamming It In</title></head><body><h1>Jamming It In</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-08-19</p><BIG>Monk Robes Stay Safe... For Some</BIG><p>Ever since news broke that Sleeper's Tomb is <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-172560563">due for a revamp</a>, those of us on one of the few servers that has not yet awakened Kerafyrm have been wondering how the change will affect us. So I asked Rich Waters for the scoop:<p><B>The ST revamp includes both a pre- and post-release version of the zone to accomodate all servers.<p>If you haven't awakened the Sleeper yet, you'll still be able to farm the warders for old items.  It's only the post-awakening Sleeper's Tomb that will have new warder loot.<p>Old warder loot has intrinsic value in that it's rare and exciting because it's unattainable once the Sleeper is awakened.  The new warders drop excellent quality loot, but it's not the same loot that was there before.</B><p>Purveyors of monk shrouds and gnome masks will be pleased, though of course there aren't many servers that will benefit. And the possibility still exists that someone on those servers will wake the Sleeper in order to get at the new warder loot--assuming the draw is great enough. But at least for now, Ventani farmers can breathe a small sigh of relief.<p><BIG>Those Unresistable Wizards</BIG><p>A poster over at Graffe's is <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=19750.topic">reporting</a> some spell changes over on the Test server. Currently the wizard's line of lure spells is hard for mobs to resist--but not impossible. The change on Test makes these spells (Lure of Frost, Lure of Ice, Lure of Flame, Lure of Lightning) unresistable, and did the same for the Strong Root spell. Additionally, the mana cost of Flaming Sword of Xuzl was dropped considerably.<p><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/">Casters Realm</a> also noted spell changes that affect beastlords, shadow knights, and clerics, plus the addition of the unresistable flag to the enchanter spells Dictate and Rapture, as well as the necro spell Enslave Death.<p>Once again, these changes are on Test only, and may or may not go live. Additionally, what effect these changes will have on certain weapon procs (like many Luclin monk weapons, which have a fire-based lure proc that is resisted by many dragons and most of the inhabitants of the Temple of Cazic-Thule) is unknown. And before any griefers make a stink about it, the impact on the PvP servers would be nil, as players basically can't resist lure spells as it is.<p>Are these changes good for the game? Sure. We all know how underpowered those poor wizards are.<p>[insert cricket noise here]<p>Enchanters and necros should like this news, too. Now they just have to keep hoping that the changes do indeed go live.<p><BIG>Do I Hear 16? 17? 20?</BIG><p>Technical guru Scott Hartsman once again spammed the necro board with <a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=7244">news</a> about DoT stacking:<p><B>Each copy of a DoT takes up its own slot, due to duration, focus, and damage credit differences. <p>We definitely know the effect that would have on DoT casters on raids. (Between Rowyl and Jahaar and the boards -- I get it. I swear. ;)<p>However, after some massive late night rewriting, we have an answer to the 15 slot limit for NPCs. We should be able to extend it out at least a little now.<p>We'll have to see how far we can take it, though - Adding a pile of new slots to every NPC in the game could have some pretty bad side effects that we'll be monitoring and tuning on test.</B><p>That's some pretty big, happy news for DoT casters. You can look forward to &quot;DoT Syndicate&quot; Web sites popping up all over the place on which necros, druids, and shamans will team up to DoT-kite ubermobs for huge profit. It may not be as fast as the manaburners do it, but 80K plat is 80K plat, no matter how long it takes to earn it.<p><BIG>Don't Patch Me, I'm Only the Piano Player</BIG><p>There was a patch scheduled for this Wednesday, but according to the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/scheduled_downtime.jsp">Scheduled Downtime</a> page, it has been postponed a week:<p><B>On Wednesday, August 28th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 3 hours. This takes place of the maintenance originally scheduled for Aug 21st.</B><p>I don't have anything witty to say about this, but I would like to point out that I believe this to be the first time an Elton John album has been alluded to in a headline. Thank you for your attention.<p><BIG>SOE is an S.O.B.</BIG><p>No, I haven't given up my VAKhood just yet. The folks at Sony Online Entertainment are having a little fun on this season of <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/battlebots/">BattleBots</a> by entering their very own fightin' robot: <a href="http://www2.station.sony.com/battlebots/">S.O.B.</a><p>Unbeknownst to most of us, SOE competed <a href="http://www2.station.sony.com/battlebots/season4.jsp">last season</a> as well, but ended up losing. The team did a retrofit of the spunky little robot and will give it another shot. The site will be updated with reports on the S.O.B.'s progress.<p>Okay, let the complaints begin... &quot;This is what Verant spends my subscription money on? Couldn't they hire an extra GM for whatever the robot costs?&quot;<p>I would speculate that this robot deal falls under SOE's promotional budget, as it draws attention to the company and its flagship product. In other words, it's not like having this S.O.B. around means you get less tech support or anything.<p>Hey, it's cooler than a billboard, anyway.<p><BIG> PvE (Players vs. EZBoard)</BIG><p>A multitude of readers <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">sent me e-mail</a> to tell me about a <a href="http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13524.topic">big blowup</a> over on the Lanys message board. Seems some <a href="http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumgeneral.showMessage?topicID=13510.topic">genuine jerkoffs</a> from the Sullon Zek board began a campaign of <a href="http://pub110.ezboard.com/feqasylumfrm45">racist and obscene spamming</a> that resulted in having the Sullon Zek board <a href="http://pub165.ezboard.com/bsullonzektothecore.lockedDown">closed down</a>. Not only was the main board shut down, but the offenders' numerous attempts to start up other EZBoard forums have been nixed, and the related accounts have been banned.<p>Kudos to Steve DeMello and the EZBoard staff for stepping up and working with Tarot of the Lanys board to squash these idiots and hopefully get them in enough trouble with their parents to have their computers taken away.<p>Racists are small-minded and lazy. There are so many compelling reasons to hate people that to fall back on their skin color, race, sexual orientation, or religion is just plain pathetic. C'mon, put a little effort into it and have the initiative to dislike people based on who they are, not what they look like or believe.<p>I really mean that, by the way.
