When it has an odd angle--such as a suicide that seems related to an video game addiction--it becomes sensationalized. While in such a case we prefer to take the high road and not <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/article.jsp?articleid=-514567911">blame the victim</a>, there are other cases where we cannot help but react.<p>Last Friday CNET posted <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1040-881673.html">yet another story</a> that had to do with EverQuest addiction--this time talking to &quot;survivors&quot; who merely let their lives fall into ruin. Well, fine. One popular story breeds others like it--that's to be expected in the news business. However, the attitude taken by the story's initial &quot;victim&quot;--Dennis Bennett--made me sick:<p><B>Bennett, whose family life and grades in school have recovered nicely since he stopped playing the game about a year ago, considers himself a recovered &quot;EverQuest&quot; addict, now able to control his desire to immerse himself in the game's rich fantasy world. <p>&quot;The game almost ruined my life,&quot; said the network engineer in southern Indiana. &quot;It was my life. I ceased being me; I became Madrid, the Great Shaman of the North. Thinking of it now, I almost cringe; it's so sad.&quot;</B><p>Dear Mr. Bennett: you are pathetic. EverQuest didn't ruin your life; you did. Your weakness. Your insecurity. Your lack of common sense. You. You. You.<p>It's become a cliche of modern culture, but it's so sadly true; people don't want to accept responsibility for anything. Blame TV and movies for an increase in violence in our society. Blame the schools for kids being stupid. Blame a video game for your own lack of self control.<p>The world is full of potentially bad things: cigarettes, booze, narcotics, guns, violent images, gambling, hurtful words... the list goes on and on. But the fact that these things exist doesn't mean you must abuse them.<p>Even a &quot;good&quot; thing, when taken to an extreme, can become a problem. Having a job is considered a good thing, yet being a workaholic is not. Being in love is a good thing, but obsessing over someone to the point of stalking them is not.<p>EverQuest--and video games in general--would be considered a &quot;good&quot; thing by most people. Video games can help develop hand-eye coordination, and multiplayer games like EQ can help build social skills. But like anything else, overindulging can lead to disaster.<p>
