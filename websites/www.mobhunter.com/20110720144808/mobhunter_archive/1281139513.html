You might find something like this in your mailbox:<p><B>Greetings Adventurers!<br>Open up new solo gameplay possibilities you've only dreamed about. Got two computers? Use the free account key provided in this email and your existing software to start a second account and play two characters together -- at the same time! How cool would it be to build a cleric or druid of your own and have them at your fingertips for buffs, healing and more? Or better yet, get a friend to join you by giving him or her this free account key. Now your friend has no excuse not to come adventure with you. Or even better still, invite a family member. Remember, the family that plays together stays together.<p>Whatever direction you choose to go, you can't go wrong! Below is an EverQuest Trilogy account key that will open a new EQ account for a FREE 30 DAY TRIAL. Take advantage of this opportunity to enrich your EverQuest experience before this promotion expires on June 30th, 2002. The enclosed account key is good for a free 30-day subscription (regular account charges applicable thereafter) and requires the EverQuest Trilogy software.</B><p>To which you might have responded with a hearty &quot;Huh?&quot; Or, maybe you were <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=27459.topic">wary</a>, given the preponderance of scams that people try to use to get your account information.<p>Relax. It's real. Honest. This mail was sent to subscribers of the EverQuest newsletter. If it isn't in your mailbox yet, it should be soon.<p>Verant is actually giving account keys away free for 30 days. It's just like you bought an extra copy of the EverQuest Trilogy (original, Kunark, Velious) without paying for the software. Look closely at the little license agreement enclosed in the e-mail:<p><B>For this limited promotional period (until June 30th, 2002), we hereby authorize you to use, or make one copy of, or loan your EverQuest software to one person -- together with the account key referenced above -- to open or enable another to open one new EverQuest account.</B><p>That's right, you are actually being permitted to copy your existing software to another computer of your own, or even onto someone else's PC. That's not something you see every day in the software industry.<p>Big deal, you say, it's only one free month. Well, you are saving the price of the software itself, plus the $12.95 subscription fee for that month. All total, that's $40 or more for no charge.<p>Why did they do it? Is EQ losing so many subscribers that they have to give the game away? No, subscriptions continue to increase. Maybe Verant just felt generous. Or maybe they figure that there's no one better to promote their game than the people who already play it, and this is a way for you to get your friends and family hooked. The &quot;make yourself a personal porter/healer&quot; idea is pretty appealing, too.<p>I'm sure the scores of Verant haters will find a way to twist this into some <a href="http://slate.msn.com/default.aspx?id=2066260">evil corporate scheme</a> designed to <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=16921.topic">steal even more of your dollars</a> while Sony increases the number of Planes of Power expansions it can sell. Well, I'm sure Verant isn't blind to that notion, but we at Mobhunter see this free key offer as a good thing--albeit a good thing that's going to cost some of us an extra $13 a month.<p>Hmmm, maybe &quot;evil corporate scheme&quot; isn't such a wild notion after all! ;-)
