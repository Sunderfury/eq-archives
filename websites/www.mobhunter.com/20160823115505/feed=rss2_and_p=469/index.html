		<description><![CDATA[By the time a MMO gets to the beta phase all of the major gameplay mechanics should be pretty much cast in stone. Beta should really be for stress testing more then anything.

I was fortunate to be a part of the WoW Friends &amp; Family alpha program and believe me when I say this, WoW was very polished then. It was fun, breathtaking, engaging and simply off the charts as a MMO experience. It was light years ahead of EverQuest and DAOC at the time.

By the time your  MMO reaches beta it should be ready for the public. As Steve has said, the public will not tolerate a MMO that is not polished and ready to be shipped even at the beta stage. How many times have we seen major MMO companies violate this cardinal rule in the past few years?

Ship it when it&#039;s ready or don&#039;t bother shipping it. Tell the publisher and the marketing departments to go jump in a lake if they tell you otherwise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;As many others have noted, not much testing goes on in the public stages of MMO betas&quot;

Why is there even an expectation of test occuring during a public MMO beta?  Are testers actually testing the product?  No.  Do testers have access to knowledge that make testing possible such as documents, environments, tools, code, content, the team building the product etc?  No.  If a company cannot stress test their system without using thousands of potential customer computers to do so they probably should not be in the MMO space.

A possible suggestion is to call these public efforts &quot;MMO demos&quot; or &quot;Warming up the Support and Live teams of an MMO&quot; as they have nothing to do with testing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Steve, 

I wonder if game developers shouldn&#039;t look at changing the way they test &amp; evaluate games. You mention that not much testing goes on in a beta test (certainly that has been my observation too). 

It seems to me that there are two issues here. The first issue is testing - making sure that code actually does what it is supposed to do. This is a very concrete issue - either the code works, or it doesn&#039;t. Those of us who develop software in the business world have started to adopt Agile methodologies, particularly TDD and other automated ways of testing code, to ensure correctness (as well as guiding design and providing for regression testing, which makes code changes and refactoring so much easier). I have read about some game companies now adopting Agile methodologies and I think that&#039;s probably a step in the right direction. Ensuring correctness is critical (players really gripe about bugs, and while we can say things like, &quot;Hey, these games are huge and they&#039;re going  to have bugs&quot; it doesn&#039;t give us license to be careless with code) and this is the part that doesn&#039;t really take place in a beta &quot;test&quot;. Which makes me believe that it needs to be a much more integrated part of the development process, like it is in an Agile shop. Testing, when automated, can have a big influence on the quality of a code base. 

The other issue, it seems to me, is evaluation. This is completely subjective. Is the game fun? Is this quest fun? Is this combat fun? Is this zone fun? That&#039;s the thing that does happen in a beta test, but by then the die has pretty much been cast. The game is what it is, so what purpose does the beta test serve? (And I think this is the thrust of your post). Other than testing load balancing issues and payment processing, I&#039;m not sure an open beta does much. 

And so I think that like code testing, evaluation has to be an integral part of the development process. It has to happen every day. If you can evaluate something in small chunks it will allow you to see the error of the design before you start piling on other assumptions... I think you&#039;ve got to have people dedicated to the idea of evaluating the game play every day while the game is being developed. Giving feedback to team, guiding the design. Much the same way unit tests can guide the design of the code, evaluators need to be there to guide the design of the game play. I&#039;m sure most games have those guys - you guys. But maybe they don&#039;t. I don&#039;t know. Never had the privilege of working on a game before. 

P.S. I&#039;d love it if you would post some info on how you guys actually develop your game at 38 Studios. Maybe only developers like me would find it entertaining though.]]></description>
