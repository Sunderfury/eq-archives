During the buff phase the lady necro at the portal spawned and got off a fear on me. Well, actually more like 3 or 4 before the mop-up squad noticed her. The last of the fears actually managed to stick. When it hit, my bearform (spirit of the great bear) was over-written. Is it intentional or a bug that Fear line overwrites bearform? <p>- Tyck of RN</I><p><B>This is a new one to me. I honestly have no idea why this is happening, but I'll look into it and try to get it fixed as soon as possible.<p>- Lawrence Poe</B><p><I>1.) The Enchanter spell Boon of the Garou has issues with the Bard epic Dance of the Blade. If Boon is on first there are no stacking problems, however if the bard epic makes it way into a buff slot first Boon will not be able to be cast.<p>2.) The Enchanter dot line(Gasping Embrace, Asphyixiate), do not stack with the Shaman epic in the same manner. If the Shaman epic is put on first, Enchanter dot will go on fine. If Enchanter dot is on first the Shaman epic will not stack.<p>-Ouden Soulshaper, 59th Enchanter<br>The Relentless, Cazic-Thule</I><p><B>There are currently some stacking issues with bards that I am looking into. I can't really tell you much more than that right now, but it's being looked at.<p>As for the Choke Line and the Shaman epic. currently these two spells never stack. If the stronger spell is applied first you will get a &quot;your spell did not take hold&quot; message. If the weaker version is applied first you will not get a message but the weaker spell will be overwritten. That being said, I will try to rectify this conflict by the next patch.<p>Thanks for the feedback.<p>- Lawrence Poe</B><p><I>Numruk wrote:<p>Enchanter Mez does not overwrite the clearly inferior Screaming Terror necro mez spell... which makes using it in a group with an enchanter a Bad Thing (tm). Are there any plans to change it to get overwritten by enchanter mez?</I><p><B>I could probably make this happen. I'll see if I can figure something out before the next patch.<p>Thanks for the suggestion.<p>- Lawrence Poe</B>
