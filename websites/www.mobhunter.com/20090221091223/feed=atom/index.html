		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=429"><![CDATA[<p>There are two kinds of people in the world: Letterman people and Leno people.</p>
<p>Jay Leno is a funny guy, and he has bits that make me chuckle, but I mourn where he&#8217;s taken <em>The Tonight Show</em> from what it once was. This television tradition now feels like a bowl of bland jello, and it remains to be seen if Conan O&#8217;Brien will be able to restore any of its former glory.</p>
<p>David Letterman, to me, is the heir to the great lineage of talk show tradition. It&#8217;s ironic, because in his NBC days he was seen as the reckless young agitator, but today he is the elder statesman. Though he&#8217;s taken on a more conventional role in some ways, he&#8217;s now in a position where he doesn&#8217;t have to care what other people say or do.</p>
<p>If you need any evidence that Letterman is at the top of his game, witness the train wreck that was last night&#8217;s interview with Joaquin Phoenix. In one of the most bizarre and uncomfortable moments ever seen on television, you can observe Letterman at the beginning of the interview almost debating whether or not to swoop in for the kill on this actor who is obviously just completely gone. It doesn&#8217;t take Dave long to decide, what the hell, I&#8217;m going for it.</p>
<p>Check out the full interview below, and <a title="The Glover clip is still a classic" href="http://weblogs.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/blog/2009/02/letterman_joaquin_phoenix_wors.html" target="_blank">this page</a> has other great moments from Letterman&#8217;s past that have him serving as ringmaster for some mind-bogglingly odd television moments.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=427"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m back from NYCC and had a great time. The panel on 38 Studios went well, even though there have been a few complaints about us not talking about the game&#8211;this despite the <em>very first slide</em> and the panel intro making extremely clear that <em>we would not be talking about the game</em>. Most people attending understood what we were trying to accomplish, and our discussion of studio process and answers to the fan questions actually hinted at quite a lot of what we&#8217;re doing, if you knew what to listen for.</p>
<p>NYCC is great. It is smaller than the San Diego version, but in a good way. The crowds are still huge but you can actually make your way down the aisles reasonably well and interesting things can stand out rather than get lost in the crowd. I would recommend the show to everyone, but then NYCC will keep growing in size and soon it will be just as unruly as SDCC.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see as many costume tragedies as last year. Sure, there were a few Slave Leias that shouldn&#8217;t have left the house, but on the whole there were few attrocities. The best costume was one I saw on Sunday: a young woman bravely dressed as Poison Ivy wearing only some carefully placed leaf appliques and a flesh-colored thong. I don&#8217;t think she had an ounce of fat on her body, and needless to say she drew quite a crowd.</p>
<p>Not that I was leering, mind you.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=425"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I&#8217;m headed back to the Big Apple with several 38 Studios cohorts to take part in a <a title="hells yeah" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/62128" target="_blank">panel discussion</a> at <a title="NYCC" href="http://www.nycomiccon.com/App/homepage.cfm?moduleid=2577&amp;appname=100453" target="_blank">New York Comic Con</a>. The theme of the panel is &#8220;MMO Development: Year Two.&#8221; It&#8217;s a follow-up to last year&#8217;s panel in which we talked about, uh, year one of the studio.</p>
<p>So this raises the question of exactly why we&#8217;re travelling to the heart of Yankee country when we&#8217;ve made clear that we&#8217;re not going to unveil the details of Copernicus this year. Well, first of all, Ten Ton Hammer asked us to do it and we like those guys. Second, it gives the MMOG fan a peek behind the curtains at how development works. Finally, its Comic Con! We&#8217;re geeks at heart and love to soak it all in.</p>
<p>If you happen to be attending the show and would like to say hello, our panel starts at 1:45pm on Saturday. I&#8217;ll be wearing my <a title="You know you want to see it" href="http://the-adventurers-club.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/adam_hughes_power_girl3_1.jpg" target="_blank">Power Girl</a> costume.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=422"><![CDATA[<p>Lum recently made <a title="It really is hard" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/02/03/fixing-mmos-is-hard/" target="_blank">the best quote about game design I&#8217;ve heard in a long time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Game design, in many ways, is convincing players that they won a struggle against imposing odds. It does not mean actually creating imposing odds.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Scott&#8217;s responses to #2 and #5 in particular are spot on. I admit I sometimes build dev rage when browsing some of the more <a title="At least I didn't say &quot;inbred&quot;" href="http://www.f13.net/" target="_blank">insular</a>, <a title="Yes, I said you, FoH" href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/" target="_blank">entrenched</a> message boards because they tend to be hangouts for posters who are personally tired of some of the characteristics of Diku-derived MMOGs. These folks proclaim, in no uncertain terms, that designers are either lazy or unimaginative for implementing things like level-based systems and launching games with fairly predictable AI for common mobs.</p>
<p>Game design is about making choices, and it&#8217;s next to impossible to explain to people why you make certain decisions if they&#8217;ve already predetermined in their minds not only why you&#8217;ve made them but that the choices you made are poor ones. Choices like the one between levels and skill-based systems aren&#8217;t inherently right or wrong; it comes down to how well they are executed.</p>
<p>All this is not to say that we shouldn&#8217;t strive for new ideas and drive the MMO genre to the frontiers of gaming. But at the same time, there&#8217;s plenty of opportunity left to use familiar, proven systems to lead players somewhere startlingly epic and amazing.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=404"><![CDATA[<p>Over on the SOE blog, my friend Tracy posted her <a title="Clearly her memory is failing" href="http://gamersinreallife.wordpress.com/2009/01/20/writers-cramp/" target="_blank">hazy recollection</a> of how she and I began working together.</p>
<p>She insists that the soda story is true, though I cannot verify it. Honestly, until I was told that a designer named Tracy would be sharing an office with me, I always assumed she was part of the cleaning crew.</p>
<p>As for her reference to throwing an owl at my eye, that is <em>absolutely </em>true. It happened shortly after I&#8217;d dropped three grand on lasik surgery, and so immediately following the incident I began plotting my revenge. But eventually her manic charm wore me down and I decided we could be friends instead.</p>
<p>Everything she says about what a joy I am to work with&#8211;also true.</p>
<p>Tracy references an upcoming book for which she and I collaborated on a chapter, but I&#8217;ll wait to pimp that until it actually exists and you can add to my $.001 royalties by purchasing a copy.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I&#8217;d post the song she references, as I still think it&#8217;s a classic.</p>

		<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.mobhunter.com/?p=398"><![CDATA[<p>Scott Jennings made <a title="Toys in the attic" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/01/16/perspectives/" target="_blank">an excellent post</a> in response to a former NCsoft executive&#8217;s examination of <a title="answer: a lot" href="http://t-machine.org/index.php/2009/01/16/we-need-to-talk-about-tabula-rasa-when-will-we-talk-about-tabula-rasa/" target="_blank">what went wrong with Tabula Rasa</a>. Both are hefty reads (especially the Martin link) but provide excellent perspectives on how one mega-budget MMOG went wrong and how another title never got off the ground.</p>
<p>So if these guys are so smart, and if <a title="Hint: it's not" href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=21613" target="_blank">making a AAA epic fantasy MMO is a solved problem</a>, then why did <a title="A bit dramatic, I think" href="http://hellforge.gameriot.com/blogs/Caveat-Emptor/The-MMO-Crash-of-2008" target="_blank">so many games</a> <a title="Such optimism" href="http://forums.f13.net/index.php?topic=15738" target="_blank">have a rough year</a> in 2008? Keep reading and I&#8217;ll be so bold as to give you my perspective.<span id="more-398"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. If making a great game was just a matter of having a few brilliant ideas, it would be a piece of cake. But brilliant ideas and a quarter will get you a moderately sized gumball.</p>
<p>Brilliant ideas are cheap. Everybody gets them. Brilliant ideas alone won&#8217;t lead you to make a great MMOG.</p>
<p>The reason these damned things are so hard to make (especially to make well) is that they require <strong>sustained focus</strong> on a <strong>mass scale</strong> throughout <strong>years of development</strong>.</p>
<p>That sounds easy to say, but it&#8217;s a Herculean undertaking. Not only do you need a clear vision and a firm direction, but you need leaders who can keep every single member of your team zeroed in on making sure every single thing they do is of the highest quality possible.</p>
<p>The success or failure of an MMOG doesn&#8217;t lie in its basic premise. The genre and feature set may attract eyeballs, but it is the details of gameplay and quality of content that will keep people playing&#8211;or, conversely, the lack thereof which will cause them to leave. All this talk of &#8220;too many fantasy games&#8221; or &#8220;too many upcoming sci fi games&#8221; is bullshit. Good games will get played regardless of genre, and bad ones won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Until I had to do the nuts-and-bolts work of game design, I had no idea how much effort and focus it took to do well. Coming up with ideas for a zone or quest is easy&#8211;pretty much anyone can come up with cool ideas for them. What isn&#8217;t easy is sitting down and implementing those ideas in a fun, clear, and polished manner. The reason poor content makes it into big-budget games comes down to one thing: a loss of focus. Whether it was the designer who was supposed to implement fun content, the artist who was supposed to build a great asset, or the lead who didn&#8217;t hold the work to high standards, somewhere along the line the focus on quality was lost. And it&#8217;s <em>so easy</em> to let things slip, especially in an environment where people are more concerned about pride or job preservation instead of being honest about the work and making results the top priority.</p>
<p>Sometimes this loss of focus happens on a team-wide scale. Other times it&#8217;s more subtle, holding together 90% of the way only to fall apart in the final details. In some cases, focus goes out the window when you have bosses forcing a deadline down your throat.</p>
<p>Thus far, Blizzard has done the best job of maintaining focus and releasing quality products&#8211;though even they haven&#8217;t gotten it perfect. Most developers, of course, don&#8217;t have the same luxury of budget and time that Blizzard currently enjoys. But let&#8217;s not use that as an excuse; you don&#8217;t need hundred million dollar budgets to make great games. You can do it on a fraction of that budget, provided you maintain your focus and don&#8217;t make any huge blunders that bleed you dry of money and time.</p>
<p>The real formula for success in the MMO space: start with a clear and brilliant vision, make the right technology choices,  bring in producers who can keep a project on track with razor precision, hire leads who know how to nurture excellence, build a team of ultra-talented artists and designers who can make brilliant content consistently and efficiently, and keep all those people focused on their objectives every single day through several years of development. Oh, and make sure you have enough money to pay the bills until the revenue starts coming in.</p>
<p>The more weak spots you have in that formula, the greater the odds that your project will fail, or at the very least won&#8217;t be what it could have been. If I haven&#8217;t been clear so far, let me be so now: <em>that formula for success is extraordinarily tough!</em></p>
<p>Most games fail&#8211;or at least aren&#8217;t the mega-hits the creators and publishers are hoping for. The same is true of most books, records, paintings, TV shows, and other creative endeavors which someone attempts to commercialize. But companies and individuals continue to take chances on all those things because, like that ever-elusive jackpot on a Vegas slot machine, when they pay out, they can pay out big.</p>
<p>The faults of an MMOG are easy to snark about and dismiss on a blog or message board. What you don&#8217;t see are the many people behind the scenes who poured their hearts and souls into those projects only to see them fall apart because somebody else lost focus. The stories behind the Vanguards and Tabula Rasas of the world, as well as those could-have-beens yet to be born, may inspire epic drama on the interwebs, but the true stories of how things went wrong are infinitely more subtle and often much more tragic.</p>
