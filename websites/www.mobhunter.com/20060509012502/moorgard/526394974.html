While we're only talking about one person's epic here, this case clearly has implications beyond a single player, or guild, or even a server.<p>We at Mobhunter agree with the SND <a href="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=18">article</a> regarding where the customer service breakdown happens. The organization of Verant's CS department looks, appropriately enough, like a <a href="http://www.ericcartman.fsnet.co.uk/sp1/gnome.htm">gnome's</a> plan for world domination:<p>1. Guides care and want to help.<br>2. ?<br>3. Executives care and want to help.<p>Time to fill in the blank, guys.<p>Like middle management in many companies, I'm sure some of the people in Verant's customer service department feel like they have to walk a very thin tightrope, and cling desperately to whatever policy guidelines have been established. But problems arise when these folks can't look past the letter of the law to see the spirit behind it--and that spirit is, in its purest form, to help honest players have the best EverQuest experience they can.<p>I don't have an answer to solve this issue. But Verant should really work with the player community to try and figure out where the breakdown happens. Not only is it the right thing to do, but it's the smart thing for any company--especially one with as much customer interaction as Verant has--to ensure its own survival.<p>Drop <a href="mailto:snowspinner@slownewsday.net">Snowspinner</a> a line if you know anything that can help shed some light on this issue. Anonymity is guaranteed.
