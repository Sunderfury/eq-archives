			<div class="entry">
				<p>I noticed that <a title="look at all those juicy comments!" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2007/02/20/nation-states-and-the-social-ganker/" target="_blank">Lum got an awful lot of traffic</a> when he wrote about PvP philosophy, and <a title="not as many comments, but still juicy" href="http://www.psychochild.org/?p=269" target="_blank">Psychochild cashed in</a> as well. This lends some weight to the notion that those who love PvP are a vocal lot who enjoy talking about their favorite style of gameplay.</p>
<p>So even though I really don&#8217;t think PvP is for suckers, I figureÂ a controversial title will get me lots of traffic and comments. Oh, what a devious blogger I have become!<span id="more-106"></span></p>
<p>I enjoy competition with other humans when there&#8217;s a reasonable chance that either side could win. A fastball competition against Schilling would not be fun because I know I&#8217;d have no hope; playing Archon against him is another story. I&#8217;m not saying everything has to be perfectly equal, but to me there&#8217;s not a lot of fun to be had if I know I&#8217;m either guaranteed to lose or guaranteed to win.</p>
<p>There really hasn&#8217;t been a lot of MMO PvP that I&#8217;ve enjoyed. Back in the days of Ultima Online, I used to dread running into the random PK deep within a dungeon when I was trying to hunt. I felt like I wasÂ at the mercy of a dialup connection as my reagents were stolen and prize armor ganked, followed by the inevitable trash talk as I stumbled around in ghost form. I dabbled with PvP in EQ and EQ2, but I ended up staying almost exclusively PvE in both games.</p>
<p>I think Lum&#8217;s take is closest to my experience. I felt like PvP was gang warfare, and since my in-game circles tend to stay pretty small, I was a target more often than I was a participant. Though such situations can be overcome if you stick with it, I frankly didn&#8217;t enjoy the playstyle enough to mold myself into a badass PK.</p>
<p>WoW&#8217;s battlegrounds probably come closest to the type of PvP I like, because you&#8217;re not at the mercy of some jackass griefing you until you give up and log out. Battlegrounds are easy in, easy out, with little mess.</p>
<p>That said, where battlegrounds miss the mark is giving players a sense that their fights matter in the big picture. A relevant part of the PvP population wants the action to have a significant role in the story and makeup of the world. DAoC did a good job with this aspect, staging RvR combat as the crux of the game.</p>
<p>While one could debate whether MMO PvP can ever be mainstream, clearly there is a large audience that appreciates exciting, well-thought-out PvP combat. Such PvP needs to be at the core of the systems you are designing, not something squished into a game that was never designed for it.</p>
<p>The ideal solution would be an MMO design that worked equally well (but very differently) for PvP and PvE. That is, everything would feel completely cohesive and complete no matter which style you played.</p>
<p>Can the perfect bridge between the two playstyles be achieved? Or must the PvP flag be an all-or-nothing deal in order to be truly satisfying to either side?</p>
<p>Come on, suckers&#8230; I mean, gentle readers. Your ideas are welcome.</p>

			<p>One thing that is a problem for me with pvp in most MMOs is that it is overly gear/level dependent, combined with the playerbases tendencies towards min/maxing.  I saw it in DAOC, and I&#8221;m seeing it in WoW.  Even with &#8216;10 level&#8217; battlegrounds, if you make the mistake of thinking it might be fun to jump into one at the lower end of the level range, you&#8217;ll be sorry.  You&#8217;ll probably be ganked a lot, and find yourself ineffective.  And even if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll get griefed and yelled at by your supposed teammates for having the nerve to come in when you aren&#8217;t &#8216;high enough&#8217;.  Because of course everyone knows that if the range is x0 to x9, you have no right to be there if you aren&#8217;t level x9&#8230;&#8230;</p>

			<p>First time poster:)  Here&#8217;s my thoughts:</p>
<p>You bascially have 4 types of players in an MMO.  PVE, PVP, crafters, and social (these folks probably fall into PVE or crafters), but they are an important part of an MMO, IMO.  Why not have the PVE folks adveture for certain drops, those drops can be given to crafters to produce PVP equipment.  The PVP folks battle for certain land masses.  If they (PVP) achieve victory for a certain land mass they &#8220;win&#8221; that area for a certain amount of time (Say a week).  Inside that land mass are PVE adventure areas, rare crafting supplies, very cool dungeon areas.  After a week the PVP scoreboard resets and we start over again.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve brought this up on the SWG boards before.  The PVE folks and the crafters and supporting the war effort (the PVP&#8217;ers).  If they win, there is a reward, being the cool adventure areas.  I think this would have worked well in SWG as one side could have controlled an entire planet.  When the scoreboard resets the faction collectively (all players) have to decide what areas they want to go after, thus opening up the social aspect in a huge way.  </p>
<p>There is a flaw in this idea however.  Everyone may just go to one side to open up the adventure area.  To curb this, each area would have to have faction dungeons and unique items for a specific faction.  That would lead to alot of programming and potential high development costs.  But it could be a hell of alot of fun.</p>

			<p>I would agree that Daoc did a lot of things right as far as PvP was concerned but I don&#8217;t think they had the best mechanics for Player for Player pvp. Asheron&#8217;s call mage fights have done the best job at this imo, although Turbine has definitely negated this in the past year or so. </p>
<p>There is a player base that searches MMO&#8217;s specifically for PvP and I personally believe they (or maybe just me) are searching for the freedom of a first person shooter with story line and quests of a RPG.</p>
<p>Sony&#8217;s Planetside took strides towards obtaining this goal, although medieval weaponry, npcs, and questing would have made that into an amazing idea that could have sparked an entire new genre of MMO games. </p>
<p>Daoc, EQ, AC, WoW all have great content to keep you interested but sometimes you need to just blow of steam and don&#8217;t want to search for a group to run around with you. Sometimes you just want to charge into a fight spells blazing, sword swinging, and know because you are just that good you can drop most of your enemy&#8217;s maybe even all of them before retreating to lick your wounds, rebuff and go hunting again.</p>

			<p>I believe it can be done through resource management.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my idea. Consider an MMO that consists of two major opposing factions, similar in concept to WoW. I&#8217;ll call these sides Red and Blue.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start from a close-up perspective. There is a stretch of neutral territory between a Red base and a Blue base. Each base contains a smithy. The neutral territory contains an iron ore mine, which may be owned by either party. Every hour, this mine will send an iron ore caravan to travel to the relevant base, depending on who owns the mine at that time.</p>
<p>Should the caravan get to the military base, the smithy gains an ability. For the next hour, all NPCs that spawn at the base receive weapon and armor bonuses. Also, all PCs that go to the smithy may receive similar bonuses that will last until the next time they have to repair said weapons and armor.</p>
<p>NPC guards will not spawn at the mine to defend it, so the owner&#8217;s base must send in squads of reinforcements every so often. Likewise, the enemy&#8217;s base will send in squads of NPCs to raid the mine on a similarly regular basis. The timing of this should be such that without player interference, the ownership of the mine will never change from one side to the other, but that its always a near thing.</p>
<p>Already, we have two quest options available depending on the environment. Basically, &#8220;Travel with the next NPC escort to defend the mine&#8221;, or &#8220;Travel with the next NPC escort to raid the mine.&#8221; This allows for PCs from both sides to engage each other in a way that actually influences the environment. </p>
<p>Also, with all those NPCs running around tactics comes into play much more than just traveling around in a high-level pack hero killing. The game mechanics should be tweaked so that, much like in the average game of Dota (if you&#8217;re familiar), travelling behind enemy lines to attack the enemy heros directly will usually result in being mass-attacked by every enemy NPC in the area. So it makes more sense to hang back and mop up those NPCs first, giving the enemy PCs a chance to turn tail if the battle isn&#8217;t going their way.</p>
<p>The focus of PvP in this way becomes changing the consequences in the environment to gain an advantage, instead of just racking up killscores.</p>
<p>The concept above becomes even more interesting when you consider other possibilities. &#8220;Travel with these NPCs to escort the caravan back to base&#8221; is one, where the reward - both environmental and personal to the PCs involved - would depend on how damaged the caravan was by the time it got to the smithy. If unharmed, a very strong armor upgrade at the smithy, and a lot of cash/a nice weapon/whatever. If highly damaged, less of an upgrade and less cash.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s &#8220;Raid the enemy caravan with these NPCs to hijack or destroy it&#8221; is another. You get a cash payment for destroying the caravan, but if you, your PC mates and your NPC escort manage to drive it back to your base, you get the armor bonus at *your* smithy, and some Blue-reward tokens that may be traded for something nice once you accumulate a whole bunch of them.</p>
<p>The idea really takes off if you give an overall arc-quest of &#8220;If we receive 20 iron ore shipments at our smithy in the space of 24 hours, we will launch a sizable NPC raid on the enemy base which will, given our superior arms and armor, have a good chance of succeeding.&#8221; If it succeeds, the Blues can actually take over the base which used to belong to the Reds. Then, the lumber mill between that base and the NEXT Red base becomes the relevant resource to manage, and the Blues may then eventually raid and take over that Red base. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all well and good for PvP, but what about PvE? Well, lets go back to when the Reds and Blues were fighting over the iron ore mine. Behind the Red military base there&#8217;s a lumber mill. This lumber mill sends wood shipments to repair the walls of the Red base with the smithy, strengthening defenses. Since this lumber mill is well within Red territory, there&#8217;s no Blues to fight. Enter the Bandit Chief. So long as the area isn&#8217;t in contention, there is a base of NPC bandits that sends out raids on the wood shipments. Without player interference, the bandit raids will always succeed over the caravan&#8217;s NPC escorts. But players that are too low level for PvP or players who just prefer PvE can tip the scales, taking the wood transport to the Red base at the front line for a reward, and ALSO BOLSTERING THE TOWN&#8217;S DEFENCES AGAINST THE BLUE ARMY ATTACKING. So even PvE has an environmental influence on the tides of battle between the Reds and the Blues.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s problems with the idea, I grant you. If the Blue Army gets on a roll and winds up taking over the whole world, the playing area for the Reds would get smaller and smaller. This would need its own solutions. But I think it would be an intelligent way of allowing for PvE or PvP in a way that influences the playing environment and that also takes to focus away from mere hero killing in the latter.</p>
<p>I stopped playing WoW a few months ago. If a system like this had been implemented, I would have kept on playing. I&#8217;m led to understand that player retention is an issue for developers. This is one potential solution that would have worked on me, and others like me.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m going to make myself late for work so my comment will have to be short (for now) <img src='http://www.mobhunter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The big thing everyone wants is for PvP to feel meaningful in the context of the game.  Killboards and ranking systems only really go so far.  But by making PvP have a purpose apart from proving the size of your manhood against the other guys on the field, then more people get into it.</p>
<p>By the same token, no one really wants PvP to eclipse other types of play in an MMO.  We call those sorts of games niche games, and historically, PvP niche games don&#8217;t do so well.  The reason?  I think mainly because even hardcore PvPers like to occasionally take some time out and see that yes, there is all sorts of other stuff in the game they can do.</p>
<p>So we want PvP to have a purpose and an impact on the game world.  But if we do that, we also want PvE to have a purpose and an impact.  And then we&#8217;ve got people who want to craft and they want that to have meaning.  And we&#8217;ve also got people who want to own houses, and because of that we&#8217;ve got people who want to set up taverns, and because of that we&#8217;ve got folks who want to sing and dance and entertain other players, and people who want to take all the houses and make them into a town, and raise an army to wage war on other cities and&#8230;.hey we&#8217;re back at PvP.  Imagine that <img src='http://www.mobhunter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Possibly the key here is designing a system in such a way that it creates, supports, and fulfills the above.</p>
<p>Anyway, time to go play in traffic.</p>

			<p>Hmmm.  No mention of Guild Wars Factions, eh?  It&#8217;s like Battle Grounds without the itemcentricity.  It is also alot like Halflife, but everyone is a snowflake, visually and skillwise, player and avatar.  I&#8217;ve witnessed groups of 4 that can take down a mob of 12, but also I have been in groups that had trouble with 3 NPCs.  There were problems with queues, but apparently if you recruit in your enemy&#8217;s lobby the game tends to get a little more balanced.  Or maybe they added a server or two, who knows.  Definitely my favorite type of RPG pvp, for sure.  4&#215;4x4 x 2, capture the flags.</p>
<p>Reminds me of a conversation I had a while back with a friend I had while in an EQ2 raid guild.  They played WoW simultaneously, and during that conversation (months after I had left) my friend mentioned they were tired of raiding and were playing the PvP game.  I thought that was way cool at the time (variety is the spice of life) but now reading this stuff&#8230; duh, you geared up raiding every night for months and now you want to go spank some Halflife refugees?  That makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Skill vs Time vs Zerg.  Seems like virtual worlds could be big enough to balance that, to provide different but equal aspects for everyone.  As many people played Halflife that play WoW, after all.</p>

			<p>Guild Wars and WoW (bg&#8217;s, not their pve) have both caught my attention over the last year, primarily because of their PvP. In my narrow view of the world, the only thing missing is to give PvP a perfectly equal footing with traditional PvE advancement. Kill other players, get xp. Kill enough other players, get item drops. Good stuff, and a heck of a lot more entertaining than traditional recycled PvE quests getting replicated across as many servers as humanly possible. </p>
<p>If you can keep a game from becoming too item-centric, there will always be a happy home for PvP. If PvP can be a solid part of your game, you prevent situations where players get sick of the pve grind and have to log into someone else&#8217;s game.</p>
<p>As with anything else though, for it to be really successful, you have to stop coddling the traditional PvE timesink timesink timesink game and give it comparable support in terms of advancement capability and item/skill improvement.</p>

			<p>Bah, you soft-hearted carebear! Gank or be ganked. When you design a game with PvP in mind, you take care of problems like &#8220;vets&#8221; ganging up on &#8220;newbies.&#8221; There&#8217;s power in numbers, and as long as you make it possible (though not easy) to kill a veteran player, you&#8217;ve solved your problems about ganking right there.</p>
<p>What I see as a major problem is what you&#8217;ve identified in your third paragraph, Moorgard. You say &#8220;to me thereâ€™s not a lot of fun to be had if I know Iâ€™m either guaranteed to lose or guaranteed to win,&#8221; yet that&#8217;s exactly what you have in a PvE game. With PvE, I&#8217;m guaranteed to win, because I can keep coming back again and again until i find out how the scripts run the NPCs, or until I&#8217;m so powerful I can bull through any obstacles. PvP is by nature unpredicatable, and so gives you a different experience each time you enter into it.</p>
<p>Items? Make them communal. Make your strategy and knowledge of how to use each item your weapon. Avid players of strategy games like Command and Conquer know that it&#8217;s that what you think that matters, not what you have. Lord knows I&#8217;ve defeated enough WoW players who had uber loot and no knowledge of how to use their skills. It&#8217;s the same in Eve, where you can shoot down any ships regardless of the equipment it has; you just need to think and bring a few friends (or a couple hundred).</p>
<p>You also need contested territory with critically important resources. Without something meaningful to fight over, PvP will be boring and lack a purpose. Give players something worthwhile to fight over and they&#8217;ll hack and slash at each other for years.</p>
<p>What we need are more games designed for meaningful, thoughtful PvP, rather than PvE games with PvP tagged on as an afterthought.</p>

			<p>One of the things that kept me in WWII Online through its awful release and terrible early featureset (before I became an employee) was the &#8216;tribal mentality&#8217;. You really felt a part of something much bigger, even when &#8220;the fight&#8221; only appeared to consist of 5 of you riding a racket old truck heading for certain doom. Being a part of an all out battle with thousands of players is quite indescribable. </p>
<p>Of course, WWII is slowly falling off people&#8217;s radars because despite our best efforts we&#8217;ve never managed to climb over those early hurdles; I think most people who&#8217;ve visited our odd little virtual world could share in calling their experience &#8216;indescribable&#8217; by merrit of not having experienced it.  c.f. Lum&#8217;s &#8220;Taxi to Victory&#8221;.</p>
<p>The underlying PvP experience does actually seem to work, though; the shared gameworld gives players several different scales to view &#8217;success&#8217; on as well as a host of different levels- and types- of versus to play at, so that a local loss doesn&#8217;t have to feel so bad weighed against a larger success and even if a side is taking losses up and down the front line, it can still be a positive in terms of the bigger picture (during the last campaign, one side baited the other into over-advancing so that they could break a strategic stalemate that had lasted 3 weeks).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unless we ever manage to change the delivery to require less willful determination to encounter that experience, it won&#8217;t be possible to tell if we got the PvP &#8220;right&#8221; or if we just happen to be tapping a very elite niche <img src='http://www.mobhunter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

			<p>I usually don&#8217;t care too much for pvp, but if it is done right I enjoy taking out my enemies as much as the next player. I didn&#8217;t really dabble in EQ2 pvp. It came in too late I guess, and it was just too hard for me to start over or even imagine that it could have been implemented well.</p>
<p>In SWG however, I did enjoy pvp from time to time. I liked that I didn&#8217;t alway shave to pvp, but at a moments notice I could jump into the epic battle and defend a city or help save a rebel base. I also had some good times as an entertainer back on the Rebel base. Imps would come in and kill everyone, and the dancer being all that was left would pull out their guns and although we would die we felt good defending out base.</p>
<p>It was also fun, once I became a bounty hunter to put up my &#8220;master dancer&#8221; tag and then &#8220;Suprise!&#8221; I&#8217;m a BH and you are dead!</p>
<p>So yes if it is done correctly pvp can be fun for either crowd. </p>
<p>And as for the traffic trickery blog&#8230; a bloggers gotta do what a bloggers gotta do!</p>

			<p>Its perhaps worth noting - our game has <i>no</i> NPCs; no quests, no killing of non-players entities. There is some &#8220;PvE&#8221; in the strictest sense, players blow up or repair bridges, destroy enemy factories in rear industrial sectors, and there are very simplistic automated defense emplacements which designed to constrain certain types of behavior (anti-air batteries at airfields, for instance)</p>
<p>An alternative reading on our longevity could be demographics of our audience - largely more mature players, and an unusually high female:male ratio. With no NPCs/level grinding, our players really do have to roll their own entertainment when they are doing something other than battling. This has comprised everything from sailing trips to the Alps to racing events at the Spa racing track, we even had a player create a &#8220;Notes from a Half-scale Island&#8221; parody of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNotes-Small-Island-Bill-Bryson%2Fdp%2F0380727501&amp;tag=kfsorg-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" rel="nofollow">Bill Bryson&#8217;s book</a>.</p>

			<p>The problem with PVP is the fact it is almost always embeded in a PVE system. In most games the &#8220;PVP&#8221; seems to be an after-thought, and this shows up alot in cases such as bad, or poor, class representations due to the fact that these games are mostly built for and around PVE. So while these games do have players fighting players, it would have to be a big stretch to call it PVP. </p>
<p>Some game will come up with a great balance of PVE and PVP, but not until they put a pencil to designing both at the same time. Countless times I have seen great PVE classes just suck so bad in PVP, and like you say it is not fun to lose every time. </p>
<p>The old-school &#8220;HARDCORE FFA&#8221; PVP rules need to finaly die. UO and similar PVP styles are nothing more than PVE. Surrogate for sure, because the PK does not do the PVE, he makes others do it for him. Developers need to make PVP change the world, and this requires great challenges. The PVP game needs great heroes, who got to be great by doing great things, not by ganking helpless lowbies and other cowerdly acts.</p>
