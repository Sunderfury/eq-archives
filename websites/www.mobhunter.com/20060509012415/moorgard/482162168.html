<html><head><title>Assorted Cheeses</title></head><body><h1>Assorted Cheeses</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-11-25</p><BIG>Free for All</big><p>SOE gave us <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=52848">good news</a> the other day about the EverQuest Instant Messenger program:<p><B>Since the release of EQIM a few weeks ago we have received a lot of very positive feedback about this new EverQuest feature. The most common comment was &quot;this is great, it should be free.&quot; At its launch we had planned on EQIM fees to offset its development cost. <p>Happily, your very positive response to the release of Planes of Power and the continued growth of new players has put us in the wonderful position where that cost is no longer an issue. <p>A big thanks to the EQ community old and new for their support of the world of Norrath. Please enjoy your free EQIM.</b><p>EQIM is a handy tool to keep in touch with your friends that have more liberal playtimes.  We're glad they've decided to make it free--it seems unlikely people would have forked over much cash for it.<p>SOE's track record is one of charging for services if it's clear that we'll pay--the character transfer service comes to mind. Thus the &quot;we've made enough cash, thanks&quot; line might just be a nice cover for the realization that Sony should be bolstering the sense of player community any way it can. Of course, that's just my <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/message.jsp?articleid=-525035302&amp;msgid=-1169342579#message">humble</a> opinion.<p><BIG>I Just Want to Dance, Dance, Dance</big><p>IGN posted some really nice video of the nVidia GeForce FX card displaying new <a href="http://pc.ign.com/articles/377/377881p1.html">EverQuest 2 footage</a>.  And it's cool.  Really cool. Like jaw-droppingly cool.<p>Of course it takes much more than polished demos to make a game a hit--just ask the Asheron's Call 2 players.  Among the largest concerns for EQ2 are the likely steep system requirements and controversial features such as item decay, player housing, and local banking.<p>Still, that whole thing with the way clothing moves is spectacular. And if your female toon can dance around like that, who needs a storyline?<p><BIG>Where Have the Spectral Parchments Gone?</big><p>In the Planes of Power, spectral parchments are turned in to acquire level 63 and 64 spells.  These are good spells.  People want them.  Spectral parchments were dropping from a few camps in Plane of Nightmare, and fairly commonly off humanoid mobs in the Halls of Honor. Since some PoP zones were brought down the last week, the parchments either stopped dropping in those places or, in the case of HoH, slowed down dramatically.<p>The boards are <a href="http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=29668.topic">buzzing</a> with speculation about this <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessageRange?topicID=12317.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20">apparent nerf</a>, and casters are upset. Although they can (in theory) level to 65 in any of the planes, only those that require a full raid force to enter will give them a shot at most of their spells. Many casters see spells as a function of their class that they have an innate right to, rather than something optional like weapons or armor. As there exists no casters' bill of rights, however, this matter is open to interpretation.<p>In any case, new spells help everybody--melee included. Every time a cleric gets a new buff or a wizard gets a new nuke, it improves the performance of your group or guild. That's something all classes have a vested interest in, and it's why nerfs like this affect everyone.<p><BIG>This Amusement Never Ends</big><p>We had a couple patches over the weekend that impacted folks who are getting deeper into PoP:<p><b>- The zone in point into the Plane of Tactics from the Plane of Tranquility has been moved to a safer location.<p>Changes affecting the Planes of Power storyline:<p>- You will now earn credit for your accomplishments in Drunder regardless of content that you have completed.<p>- There were places where you could progress through the storyline without knowing why, these have been corrected. If you find there was someplace you could once go but no longer can, be sure to speak to those who have been your guides thus far.</b><p>What's this all about? If you like <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/html/index.php">Gallagher</a>, you can get the FoH perspective on how the storyline was &quot;fixed.&quot; Essentially, people were bypassing content because of bugs in the flag progression--and l337 <a href="http://www.tritonguild.com/images/leet/betabert.jpg">beta infoz</a>, of course. People still have access to Sol Ro's tower that apparently shouldn't, but I'm sure the ubers will work all that out, FoH will get their Plane of Fire back, and all will be right with the world--or as right as a world full of Gallagher pictures can be, I guess.<p>In any case, <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.net/">Tork's story</a> of getting his &quot;little friend&quot; stuck in a medical device is a lot funnier than some bald guy smashing melons with a sledgehammer. Who the hell thinks that's funny?<p><BIG>Hey Man, Nice Shot</BIG><p>Experiencing killer lag since PoP came out? You're not alone. Linkdeaths are on the rise, making your typical raid look like the homicide rate in D.C.<p>Over on the Technical Help board (yes, pilgrim, it still exists), players have submitted some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/033821.html">hard data</a> that has pointed to what might be the problem:<p><B>Based on the information you provided, and until I hear otherwise, I am convinced that the /serverfilter command is broken. This is a severe issue and I will make sure the appropriate people are made aware of it.<p>Best Regards,<br>Jonathan Caraker<br>Sony Online Entertainment</B><p>If true, fixing the /serverfilter command could be a wonderful, wonderful thing. Basically, if you're on a dialup connection in a raid situation, you <I>will</I> go linkdead. It's a given. Since not everyone can get broadband (/comfort), any help provided by /serverfilter actually working would be most appreciated.<p>Now if only they'd get that /moronfilter command working, I'd be good to go.
