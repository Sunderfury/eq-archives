There's no final corpse count, but it was reported that melee each had about 10 or so. A zerg rush? Sure. But an extremely worthy one--and I doubt AoW is going to be killed by three groups anytime soon.<p><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/~danu/mh_pics/aowfight3.jpg"><p>Read all about it on the pages of <a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com">Legacy of Steel</a> and <a href="http://www.shockofswords.com">Shock of Swords</a>.<p>The phat lewts were... well, pretty dog-gone phat.<p>Shock of Swords got (aptly enough) this sword:<p><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/~danu/mh_pics/BladeOfCarnage.jpg"><p>Legacy of Steel got these gems:<p><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/~danu/mh_pics/flayedbarbarianhidemask.jpg"><p><img src="http://www.linkdead.com/~danu/mh_pics/ringofdestruction.jpg"><p>I don't think they went to Tigole's bank, but you can never be too sure, I guess.<p>Congrats to both guilds on a very significant accomplishment. You are Mobhunter's <b>L33t D00ds of the Week!</b><p>And yes, I just made that up. Sue me.
