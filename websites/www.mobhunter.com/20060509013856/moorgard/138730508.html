Items occasionally poof in the new UI if you loot them from a corpse too quickly.<p>The problem is that the new UI doesn't follow some of the same inventory handling rules as the old UI. For now, the best way to get around it is to loot containers slower, as if you were using the old UI. <p>Remember how the old UI would pause you between looting bags from your corpse? Unfortunately, for now, you'll have to do something similar on your own. Please pause for a few seconds (longer if you are badly lagged) between looting items, especially containers, and you shouldn't be affected by this problem any longer.<p>In the meanwhile, if you do not wish to take this precaution, you may always switch back to the old ui via the /NEWUI command, then logging out and restarting EverQuest.<p>We have a fix that will be working soon on Test (if it isn't already) and will be rolled out to the live servers in the next patch, courtesy of Messrs Wamtin and Rowyl.<p>Thanks both for the patience, and all of the information. We'll get this fix live just as soon as it's stable.</B><p>That's a simple enough workaround, I guess, but vanishing items is a major problem and it took way too long for this issue to be addressed. If items were suddenly being <I>added</I> to player's inventories, we all know how quickly Verant would be fixing it.<p>For now, if you do lose items, petition for help immediately. I wonder if the GM will ask you if you packed the bags yourself and if they have been in your possession at all times.<p><BIG>No Cap for Me, Thanks</BIG><p>Yesterday we wrote about the apparent discovery of a mana cap by some Fires of Heaven members and the general kvetching that resulted from it. But a reader named Jake has pointed us to <a href="http://seq.sourceforge.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1738">another perspective</a> on the matter that seems to refute the claims of the FoH folk:<p><B>Anyway, the fact is, there's no frigging &quot;soft cap&quot; on mana, at least not one that I've found. I have tested far past the &quot;4250&quot; cap they quoted, and casting a 100 mana spell results in mana that is appropriate in reduction. Using the client UI with %% as testing is like using a yard stick to measure millimeters. Why the hell would you do something like that? <br>...<br>As I stated a LONG FRIGGIN TIME AGO, the +mana scale for 200+ int is a SLIDING scale that I was NEVER able to pin down the exact formula for. It is not, nor has it ever been a +6 per int over 200. I thought I had pinned it down to 6.5 per int, but that turned out to not fit the curve either. <p>The entire Verant mana system is fairly complex in regards to INT/Mana items, and anyone using the UI as a measuring stick is either just plain ignorant or wants attention. To add insult to injury, a couple of the people posting seem to have forgotten that MANA UPDATES only come when a spell is cast. Your client estimates how much mana you *might* have, and a mana cap at 4250 IN THE CLIENT <I>may exist</I> but it does <I>not appear</I> to exist ON THE SERVER... as evidenced by CASTING SPELLS (duh) and looking at the resulting mana. <p>Now, in closing, I'm not saying they are 100% wrong. What I am saying is that everything they've provided for evidence so far is either so horribly skewed by bad data, or outright propaganda that taking anything said in that post as of this writing is like buying Enron stock.</B><p>This discussion is based on evidence found through the use of ShowEQ, a notoriously illegal program that reads the packets sent to and from the Verant servers to provide you with all kinds of info that SOE doesn't want you to have. While we don't take a stance on whether or not people should be using this software, the evidence it provides in this case is pretty compelling, and seems to refute the FoH arguments. Proper testing requires accurate methods, and the EQ client itself is--likely by design--not always going to provide them to you.<p>Somewhere, methinks, the Verant technical team is chuckling. I'm just glad all my +HP items are safe from casters once again.<p><BIG>Easy, Mac</BIG><p>The EverQuest Live site has posted a <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/eq_mac.jsp">FAQ</a> for the impending release of EQ for the Macintosh OS X. As rumored, Mac players will have separate servers from their PC counterparts, ostensibly for reasons of game balance.<p>This seems a little suspect to me. If a new server comes up for PC users, no one is prevented from starting a new character there. Players can even pay to have their characters transferred to it. So why is the Mac crowd being treated differently? If a Mac user wants to play on the same server as his friends who have PCs, why shouldn't he be able to, just like anyone who buys the game for the first time today? I imagine there may be technical issues behind this decision moreso than gameplay reasons.<p>The Mac version of EQ is expected to ship in spring of 2003. It's being ported by a company called <a href="http://www.westlakeinteractive.com/">Westlake Interactive</a>, who has done conversions of The Sims, Deus Ex, Scrabble, Unreal Tournament, Civilization: Call To Power, Madden NFL(TM) 2000, Total Annihilation, Railroad Tycoon II, Falcon 4.0, Tomb Raider I, II and III, and Unreal. Sounds like they have the proper credentials for the job.<p>That's all we have for you today. The EQ Invasion thing is in town today and tomorrow, and the Mobhunter staff intends to see what it's all about. Hopefully we get a free mousepad or something.
