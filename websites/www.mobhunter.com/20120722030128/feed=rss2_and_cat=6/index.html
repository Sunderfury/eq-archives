		<description><![CDATA[What does the original Clash of the Titans have to do with classic MMOs? Find out in this compelling post.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent the entire weekend angry that the new <em>Clash of the Titans</em> was so horrible. This was one of the seminal films of my youth, a tale that had nurtured my love for heroic fantasy, and it was utterly ruined by an almost unwatchable farce of a remake.</p>
<p>Monday at work I must have vented my frustration a half-dozen times. At one point, I even proclaimed that I would have been happy if only the film makers had reshot the original script and added updated special effects.</p>
<p>After fuming for a while, I realized I hadn&#8217;t seen the original film in many years. So over lunch I fired up Netflix and bounded over to my instant queue, where I had the old <em>Clash of the Titans</em> waiting for me.</p>
<p>By the time I was 30 minutes in, I realized how utterly wrong I had been. If the original script were shot today, moviegoers would laugh themselves out of the theater. It was bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>So why did I have such fond memories of this film from when I was a kid? While I&#8217;d like to think my tastes in film are more discerning now than when I was a boy, it couldn&#8217;t just be the ignorance of youth. Because despite the movie&#8217;s terrible dialogue and overwrought acting, I had one thing right: the movie told a really good story.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d done was internalize the myth. I&#8217;d taken what was great and resonant about the story and hung onto it, discarding all the nonsense that sticks out like a sore thumb when watching the film today.</p>
<p>We do the same thing with so many aspects of life, including MMOs. Many of us look back on our days in Ultima Online, EverQuest, Asheron&#8217;s Call, and other early online games through the haze of selective memory. We internalize the myths that matter: the long camps that netted a coveted item, the fight to survive a Mistmoore train, your raid wiping and recovering in the wee hours of the morning. These tales are as vivid and vital today as they were when first experienced, and serve as the foundation for countless reminiscences with old friends.</p>
<p>But when I go back to EverQuest to check out the latest expansion or run through a familiar area, the game is virtually unplayable to me. The interface feels archaic, a huge impediment that actually gets in the way of my fun. Yet despite many evolutions over the years, it&#8217;s largely the exact same interface I spent countless hours interacting with.</p>
<p>Interfaces aren&#8217;t memorable. Dialogue and quests fade away.Â  The myths we internalize are rooted in the heroics of social interaction and the drama of emotional investment. If you can make a game&#8211;or movie, or book, or comic&#8211;with an experience that genuinely moves the audience, you can make something memorable. Because by doing so, you will have touched he myths that lie at the heart of all of us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently bought the first season of Star Trek (The Original Series, of course) on Blu-Ray. It&#8217;s very cool, because you can switch between watching the episodes with the original special effects or the nicely redone versions they syndicated a couple years back. Unlike most revisions to classic shows, the updated effects took nothing away from the episodes and were handled very tastefully.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy a lot of series on DVD, but the original Trek is definitely worth the purchase. This spiffy set makes me wish another of my favorite science fiction shows would receive the same treatment: Babylon 5.</p>
<p>B5 is perhaps the best written show of its kind, groundbreaking in that it was plotted out as a complete story intended to run five seasons. Its themes and characters hold up exceptionally well, but its special effects look horribly dated. If it&#8217;s hard for me, a die-hard fan, to stomach the ancient Amiga-era CGI, it would no doubt be tough for a modern audience used to the glorious effects of Battlestar Galactica to get past them.</p>
<p>Releasing a remastered Blu-Ray and DVD of Babylon 5 with new CGI would allow the show to stand the test of time and catch on with a new audience. Is it likely to happen? Who knows. Though the show always struggled in the ratings, it has sold extremely well on DVD and prompted Warner Brothers to fund further TV movies and DVD projects (including a couple attempts at follow-up shows). In fact, Warners keeps flirting with the idea of a theatrical film, though it&#8217;s still uncertain as to whether it will happen. If B5 does make it to the big screen, reviving the franchise with a remastered DVD set would be a natural promotion for a movie.</p>
<p>So while I won&#8217;t hold my breath for B5 being revamped, I can look forward to seasons 2 and 3 (yes, even 3) of Trek to grace my LCD screen. And that&#8217;s not a bad thing at all.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get emotional over Star Trek.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, our fuzzy old TV could catch about six stations: the three networks, PBS, a local independent, and maybe a UHF channel or two. Although the local station ran blocks of monster/horror movies on the weekends, there wasn&#8217;t much else on the airwaves for a skinny nerd to call his own.</p>
<p>The glorious exception was reruns of Trek&#8211;The Original Series, which at the time was The Only Series. I devoured those episodes, watching them again and again. I cried every time Captain Kirk had to let Edith die in order to save the timeline, and cheered every time he beat the Gorn. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and all the rest were a lifeline to me. No other fictional world before or since has had such a profound impact on my life, shaping my imagination and giving me an ideal to strive for.</p>
<p>When I was older I embraced the movies, TNG, DS9, and to a lesser extent the other shows. Though there was plenty of mediocre moments in those hundreds of hours of Trek, there were also some profoundly moving experiences. No matter how many times I&#8217;ve seen The Wrath of Khan, those scenes between Kirk and Spock leave me a blubbering mess. Shatner&#8217;s acting takes plenty of well-deserved knocks, but when he chokes on his words as he eulogizes Spock, I think it&#8217;s one of the most touching moments on film.</p>
<p>So when I heard plans to relaunch the franchise with a new cast taking on the classic roles of the original Trek, I was more than skeptical.</p>
<p>Happily, my fears were put to rest in the first five minutes of the film. It&#8217;s wonderful; go see it. It&#8217;s not just a great Trek film (possibly&#8230; <em>possibly</em>&#8230; the best of them all), it&#8217;s a great movie. I loved it.</p>
<p>If you need to hear more, there are some minor spoilers after the break.<span id="more-486"></span></p>
<p>So yeah, this is a relaunch of the franchise. Thankfully, it&#8217;s done in a way that honors continuity even as it renders it obsolete. (This is a good thing, by the way. The Trek franchise had way, way too much baggage to go forward the same way it had been. If they didn&#8217;t do a reboot like this, they would have needed to find another way to strip away excesses and focus on a new story.)</p>
<p>The scenes with Nimoy are spectacular. When he says <em>the line</em> to Kirk&#8230; you know the one&#8230; I nearly blubbered like a schoolboy.</p>
<p>The new cast is really good. Chris Pine nails all the important aspects of Kirk&#8217;s character without even coming close to parodying Shatner. Quinto is a great Spock, and made me forget all about Sylar. Karl Urban is perfect&#8211;PERFECT&#8211;as McCoy. And Simon Pegg is wonderful as Scotty, a role he completely makes his own.</p>
<p>I even liked the antagonist, Nero. He wasn&#8217;t some dastardly cosmic villain out to destroy the universe; he just wanted to inflict pain upon those he believed were responsible for his own.</p>
<p>Sure, it wasn&#8217;t a perfect film. You have to make a few leaps of plausibility similar to those needed in most action movies. But, importantly, you don&#8217;t have to turn a blind eye to blatant inconsistencies of character because there aren&#8217;t any. Our heroes act the way we want them to, and even though the timeline has been distorted they end up exactly where we want them to be.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t figured it out yet, I couldn&#8217;t be happier about this movie. Star Trek lives again, bringing with it the best of the original characters and all the adventure I fell in love with as a kid, updated for a new generation of moviegoers without compromising the important stuff. My hat&#8217;s off to J. J. Abrams for breathing new life into a franchise that had grown bloated and stale.</p>
<p>This cast is signed for two more films, and I can&#8217;t freaking wait to see them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Battlestar Galactica&#8217;s finale has aired. It didn&#8217;t answer <a title="A good list" href="http://io9.com/5174139/12-plotholes-that-must-be-filled-in-the-battlestar-finale" target="_blank">every question we had</a>, but it resolved most of them. Perhaps more importantly, it gave us closure for the characters we&#8217;ve come to care about over the past five or so years.</p>
<p>Plenty o&#8217; spoilers after the break.<span id="more-458"></span></p>
<p>I am pleased with how they wrapped up most of the character arcs. Initially I assumed they&#8217;d kill off one or more main characters (Apollo seemed a likely candidate), but I guess Ron Moore and company preferred the soppy goodbyes.</p>
<p>Accepting the show&#8217;s answers to several of its bigger mysteries requires buying into some pseudo-religious hand waving, and I suppose I did that. The conclusion of Starbuck&#8217;s arc was fine with me (sent back from the dead to lead her people to a new Earth, and after saying goodbye to Lee she just disappears), although I guess we&#8217;ll never be sure where she got that new viper. We are left to assume that the &#8220;in the head&#8221; versions of Six and Baltar were angels of a sort, ensuring that divine will be carried out.</p>
<p>To me the real brilliance of the episode was tying the Cylon colony into the vision of the opera house. That was really well done and felt very satisfying. And I was fine with the discovery of a replacement Earth that turned out to be the planet we inhabit, although I thought it was a bit of a stretch that two planets would have the same continental configuration.</p>
<p>Though there is still one more dose of BSG in our future (&#8220;<a title="I plan to eat a burrito" href="http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b104849_edward_james_olmos_tells_future_of.html" target="_blank">The Plan</a>,&#8221; a TV movie which delves into the Cylon&#8217;s much-alluded to scheme), the show is over. I can&#8217;t help but think about how it will stack up against what I consider the landmark of episodic science fiction: <a title="The gold standard" href="http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/lurker.html" target="_blank">Babylon 5</a>.</p>
<p>While B5 made some course corrections along the way (due mostly to cast changes and the uncertainty of whether it would be able to air a fifth season), it fulfilled the promise of playing out a complete storyline that was envisioned in advance. Its special effects are painfully dated and some of the acting is stiffer than cardboard, but the story arc told by the show was spectacular and the writing was often pure poetry.</p>
<p>In contrast, BSG had superb acting and astonishingly good special effects which I believe will hold up well for many years to come, but its writing and charaterization were spotty and it clearly wasn&#8217;t plotted out from the beginning. In the recent SyFy (/giggle) special on the show, Ron Moore even admitted they didn&#8217;t know who the final five were until the team sat down to write the episode that revealed them. As one of those guys who <em>wants to believe</em>, that kind of thing disappoints me.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s my ultimate test. When the final episode of B5 aired, I wept like a baby as a show I loved came to its conclusion and I said goodbye to some beloved characters. When the finale of BSG was done there were no tears; I was satisfied and almost relieved that the show ended without screwing anything up.</p>
<p>So when all is said and done, BSG will be a show that I greatly enjoyed but wasn&#8217;t as satisfying as it could have been. I could have lived with lower production values and a weaker cast if the show had carried through a consistent story and vision. BSG was great television, but there&#8217;s plenty of room for episodic genre fiction that reaches even greater heights.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hate saying it as much as you hate me for saying it, but it&#8217;s true. In what should be the best of its seasons, Battlestar Galactica&#8217;s final batch of episodes has been mostly dreadful.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t complain so much were it not for another show that is making its peers pale in comparison. The show you should be watching: Lost.</p>
<p>Further thoughts (and some spoilers) after the break.<span id="more-438"></span></p>
<p>First of all, let me make clear that I <em>love </em>Battlestar Galactica. It&#8217;s one of the greatest genre dramas ever. But that&#8217;s not to say it hasn&#8217;t had its flaws&#8211;and those must be recognized. The story is enthralling, but the show&#8217;s craft at telling that story has been spotty. The main points of the story are clear and compelling, but many of the details (especially those related to prophecy and visions) are convoluted to the point of approaching the X-Files record-setting level of convolutedness. Major characters behave inconsistently, flip-flopping opinions and relationships seemingly at random (Lee/Bill, Starbuck/Apollo, etc.). And the worst sin of all, manifested in the first few episodes of this final season, is squandering these last precious hours with boring and inconsequential navel-gazing on the part of the main characters.</p>
<p>The low point for me was a couple episodes ago, where Anders&#8211;after being shot in the head&#8211;finally reveals some of the show&#8217;s big secrets. So why am I complaining? Because all these great secrets were revealed through ham-handed exposition. After all the opportunities they had to uncover secrets on Earth or other locations, the big reveal comes via a conversation in a hospital bed. Ridiculous and disappointing.</p>
<p>Look, there&#8217;s still time to turn it around. If the final four episodes (and subsequent TV movie) wrap up the burning questions and generally kick butt, the legacy of BSG will be secure and you can call me a jackass. But even if it finishes in a blaze of glory, I&#8217;d argue that the show wasn&#8217;t as great as it could have been.</p>
<p>As I said before, the show that is ruling the airwaves this year is Lost. I&#8217;m the first to say that this series has had its ups and downs (season one rocked, season two sucked, season three was so-so, season four was good), but since premiering its fifth season it has absolutely been <em>on fire</em>. Lost, in its second-to-last season, has the things I was expecting BSG to offer in every one of its final episodes: exciting revelations about some of its key mysteries, throwing shocker after shocker to the audience in a way that makes them squeal with delight. (Okay, I admit that I squeal with delight. Out loud.)</p>
<p>Shocked as I am to say it, it feels like the writers of Lost know exactly where they want to take their show while the guys behind BSG are well, lost. I certainly hope I&#8217;m proven wrong.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t want you to think I&#8217;m just being harsh on BSG. Another show that should hang its head in shame is Heroes. I thought the last volume (&#8220;Villains&#8221;) brought some life back to the show, aside from the horrible waste of Papa Petrelli&#8217;s unsatisfying demise. The current volume, &#8220;Fugitives,&#8221; has been floundering. Sylar with a teen sidekick? Noah back into a clone of his previous job? Claire back to being a whiny teen? Nathan a jackass yet again? Please.</p>
<p>Look, we want Peter to have his powers back so that he can once again be the counterpoint to Sylar. We want the characters to have learned something from all they&#8217;ve been through. We want cool super-powered fights. And we want to show to stop leaning on the stupid draw-the-future power as its main method of framing conflict. (What the hell was that wedding in India about, anyway?)</p>
<p>Oh, and Dollhouse. I love Joss Whedon&#8217;s work, but this show won&#8217;t last long unless Fox is committed to keeping it on life support. There is certainly potential in the story arc, but the character of Echo has been portrayed as little more than a victim in both episodes we&#8217;ve seen so far. She better start kicking ass soon, or the public will never connect to her.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#8217;ll mention Legend of the Seeker. I read a promishing article about the show before it premiered, only to see the pilot which was dreadful. But I had some of the subsequent episodes playing in the background as I did other things and found myself enjoying them. It&#8217;s still by no means great, but it might shape up into something worthwhile.</p>
<p>I love it that there is a strong (or potentially strong) crop of fantasy/sci-fi/supernatural shows on right now. But loving these genre shows doesn&#8217;t mean we should hold them to lower standards. We need more great TV, and BSG and its cohorts need to work even harder to earn legitimacy in the eyes of the often narrow-minded public.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two kinds of people in the world: Letterman people and Leno people.</p>
<p>Jay Leno is a funny guy, and he has bits that make me chuckle, but I mourn where he&#8217;s taken <em>The Tonight Show</em> from what it once was. This television tradition now feels like a bowl of bland jello, and it remains to be seen if Conan O&#8217;Brien will be able to restore any of its former glory.</p>
<p>David Letterman, to me, is the heir to the great lineage of talk show tradition. It&#8217;s ironic, because in his NBC days he was seen as the reckless young agitator, but today he is the elder statesman. Though he&#8217;s taken on a more conventional role in some ways, he&#8217;s now in a position where he doesn&#8217;t have to care what other people say or do.</p>
<p>If you need any evidence that Letterman is at the top of his game, witness the train wreck that was last night&#8217;s interview with Joaquin Phoenix. In one of the most bizarre and uncomfortable moments ever seen on television, you can observe Letterman at the beginning of the interview almost debating whether or not to swoop in for the kill on this actor who is obviously just completely gone. It doesn&#8217;t take Dave long to decide, what the hell, I&#8217;m going for it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It saddened me not a little this week to read that <a title="A piece of history" href="http://www.startrekexp.com/" target="_blank">Star Trek the Experience</a>, a museum/theme ride that has been in the Las Vegas Hilton for over a decade, <a title="Boldly going into retirement" href="http://trekmovie.com/2008/06/29/star-trek-the-experience-closing-in-september/" target="_blank">will be closing this September</a>.</p>
<p>I am sorry to see it go, not only because I am a lifelong Trek fan (however dated some of the multimedia stuff was, the collection of memorabilia was first rate) but because of the countless Fanfaire memories forever associated with the place. I&#8217;ve attended many SOE gatherings at the Hilton, and Quark&#8217;s Bar was always the epicenter where fans and devs could hang out together. Many a <a title="Don't believe what the page says--one person can drink this!" href="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Warp_core_breach_(beverage)" target="_blank">Warp Core Breach</a> has been consumed while discussing the latest patch or sharing war stories of a raid gone wrong.</p>
<p>There are hints that the Experience may be reopened elsewhere. Certainly if the <a title="Click the red dot for some kind of ARG" href="http://www.startrekmovie.com/" target="_blank">franchise relaunch film</a> is a hit, you can expect to see all kinds of updated Trek in the media. But for us diehards, the original STE will be remembered fondly as a Mecca to which we could make our nerd pilgrimage, a place where we could share our fandom and not feel so alone in the galaxy. It was a place of hope and dreams, and we need more of those in this life, not fewer of them.</p>
