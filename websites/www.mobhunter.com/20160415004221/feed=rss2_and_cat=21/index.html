				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are various dates one can identify with the death of 38 Studios. You could cite the day the company failed to pay its employees. You could choose the date the company declared bankruptcy. For me, 38 Studios was about the team and the friendships we shared, so I mark May 24 as the point it ended&#8211;the day we were officially laid off and walked out of our office together for the last time.</p>
<p>As one of my former colleagues recently noted, in some ways it feels like barely any time has passed; in other ways, it feels like a hundred years. There remains a surreal quality to the whole thing, a disbelief that it ever really happened. Yet there are reminders of it everywhere in my life, reminders that leave a sense of unfinished business.</p>
<p>The studio and its most recognizable faces still turn up in the news regularly. Most recently, the lawsuit against Curt and others involved in the bond deal has made headlines, along with an article saying that the IP and assets are finally going up for sale. The former is a farce grounded in political posturing, an attempt to shift blame away from politicians who want to be reelected. I&#8217;m confident the truth will come to light.</p>
<p>The latter is more personal. My blood and dreams flow through Amalur; the lack of closure has left me unsettled. The prospect of someone finally buying the work that my friends and I put so much of ourselves into leaves me with mixed feelings. Copernicus will never see the light of day, at least not in the form we intended it to take. Some buyer with an engine and a suitable back-end could take the considerable assets we created and plug them into their game, instantly owning some of the best looking characters, environments, and animations on the market. While much of the focus in the press has been on the MMO, another possibility often overlooked would be to take the work the BHG team had done on pre-production for Reckoning 2 and release a sequel. The first game was well-reviewed and it continues to attract players, so there&#8217;s definitely money to be made if a company could do it right. But with the key members of both teams spread across the globe, the chances of pulling off a successful product are slim at best. After all, it&#8217;s the teams who truly make their games shine&#8211;not assets on a hard drive.</p>
<p>On the one hand, I&#8217;d love to see something finally come about from all the work we did. But if the result is some stranger butchering our material and slapping the Amalur logo on shoddy work, I&#8217;d rather the assets just fade away into the mists of time. I can only hope that if someone does buy it, they treat it with the respect it deserves and realize they&#8217;ve acquired something pretty special. We&#8217;ll soon find out.</p>
<p>Today I read that it takes half the duration of a relationship to finally get over it. If that&#8217;s true, I&#8217;ve got at least a couple more years before I can truly move on. But that&#8217;s okay; despite the challenges and pain I&#8217;ve felt since it ended, the memories and friendships forged at 38 continue to enrich my life, and have given me countless lessons to draw upon in my career going foward.</p>
<p>It was all worth it&#8230; every beautiful, heartbreaking minute.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former 38 team members have been posting more work-in-progress assets, and I wanted to honor the team&#8217;s efforts by passing them along. It should be noted that I&#8217;m only linking this material&#8211;some of the coverage of my last post made it sound like I&#8217;m the one releasing them, which is not the case.</p>
<p>The <a title="Jottunhessen - part 1" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obw-RZk6sD0&amp;" target="_blank">first video</a> shows off Jottunhessen, seat of power of the Amaranthine. It was built upon the ruins of the Kollossae floating city of Pelios, which was brought down through the combined efforts of the Dokkalfar, Jottun, and Tyrgash about a hundred years before the start of the MMO. This event would cause the collapse of the Hyperian Empire and usher in the Age of Heroes. The city retains elements of Kollossae architecture, but was deliberately perverted as a way to remind the haughty giants that they were brought low thanks to the manipulation of the dark elves. (How&#8217;s that for a lorebomb?)</p>
<p>The first video shows the city as it was originally built, but we found that it exceeded our performance budgets and made the client engineers&#8217; heads explode. An optimization pass had to be made, which is what the <a title="Jottunhessen - part 2" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXy9WFmE4gs" target="_blank">second video</a> captures. This kind of rework is a reality of game design, especially when your engine is still being optimized along with the art. The lessons learned here saved us a lot of time on subsequent cities, such as Valiance.</p>
<p>I wanted to call out one of our philosophies in world design: if you could see a point of interest in the distance, we wanted you to be able to get to it. If you notice the huge spire hanging over Jottunhessen, that was the ruling seat of the dark elves and you could make your way up into that tower for an awesome view of not just the city, but of surrounding zones. You could jump out a window in the spire, and if you lined up your jump correctly, land in the Well of Souls that was positioned below. That was a ton of fun to do!</p>
<p>Again, please understand that these are artist-created milestone review videos intended only for the team, and should not be thought of as trailers or something that was meant to show off to an outside audience.</p>
<p>One of our composers has also posted some <a title="Behold the could of sound!" href="http://soundcloud.com/gene-m-rozenberg/sets/kingdoms-of-amalur-selected-1" target="_blank">samples of the excellent music</a> he wrote for the project. We had some great music written for the game, and this is just a taste of what had been recorded over the years. We believed that music and sound effects were every bit as important for storytelling as art or design, and I was always delighted by how seriously our audio team took that philosophy to heart. They really sought to understand the story and world we were crafting, and were regularly running their work past me and others to make sure that what they put together matched the tone of the zones and the races who inhabited them.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy these bits of beauty as much as I do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, <a title="The news just won't go away" href="http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/08/16/copernicus-would-have-been-f2p/" target="_blank">internet</a> <a title="Attention from Kotaku is always a mixed blessing" href="http://kotaku.com/5936009/would-it-change-your-mind-to-know-curt-schillings-beautiful-copernicus-mmo-was-supposed-to-be-free+to+play" target="_blank">news</a>, Kingdoms of Amalur would have been free to play. The idea was to have no cost for the client and no monthly fee&#8211;as few barriers to adoption as possible.</p>
<p>Curt&#8217;s &#8220;atom bomb&#8221; comment was referring to how we planned to market the title. We would have revealed the game, teased its ongoing storyline and world-changing events, demonstrated cool gameplay, and shown off its gorgeous world, characters, and best-in-class animation. Then, when the audience saw how vast and fun the game was, we&#8217;d reveal that there was no cost to play it.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t going to be crippled. You weren&#8217;t going to be kept from certain parts of the world if you didn&#8217;t pay. The transactions were intended to enhance your experience, to give you more options (like buying vanity appearances, stuff for your house, pets and mounts, etc.), but would not limit your play of the core game. And there would be a premium membership option, much like a subscription, that gave you perks and currency so you wouldn&#8217;t need to fiddle with microtransactions if you didn&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>Here is an environmental fly-through made by the head of our city building crew for our May milestone presentation to the team&#8211;an event that never happened because the studio went under. It was shot in engine with population turned off; again, this was built as an internal asset to show off art, not as a game trailer. It does an incredible job of demonstrating how gorgeous the world of Amalur was.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oD2DK2HoAyw" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more I&#8217;d like to tell you about the game, such as how our fully planned four-year story arc was driven by player participation. How the theme of choice and consequence permeated our systems, content, and world design. How the choices players made during our chapter-based story arc would cause permanent and lasting changes to each server&#8211;changes that could be different from other servers. How expansions to the game world had already been mapped out and were tied into that chapter storyline, so the world would grow in a very organic and logical way rather than feeling like expansions were tacked onto the core game by a new team that was bored with the work that had been done before. How our storyline had a real conclusion&#8211;because you can&#8217;t tell a great story without an ending.</p>
<p>But I should probably keep my mouth shut. The glorious state of Rhode Island now owns the assets and code that would have been our game, and some company might come along and buy it&#8230; though anyone who does won&#8217;t be releasing the same product we had planned to put out&#8211;only a pale imitation of it.</p>
<p>I wish you could know what we were shooting for during the years we labored to build Copernicus&#8230; a game that was loving crafted, that was starting to show how fun it would be, and that absolutely did have members of the dev team playing it, no matter what anyone else might tell you.</p>
<p>But sadly, we&#8217;ll never really know what could have been.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to post a few points of clarification about the Copernicus (Kingdoms of Amalur) teaser that was recently <a title="leaky pants" href="http://kotaku.com/5924410/the-trailer-you-werent-supposed-to-see-for-a-game-youll-never-play" target="_blank">leaked to Kotaku</a>. After we released the environment fly-through video in the last days of 38 Studios, there were a lot of misconceptions about what the video was intended to be, and I don&#8217;t want the same fate to befall this piece.</p>
<ul>
<li>This teaser video was a work in progress, from the illustrations to the game footage to the audio. It was a rough cut to get the pacing right; pretty much every asset would have been reworked or replaced by the time it went final. In fact, there were some tweaks to the script that had been made, but we never got around to recording the updated read-through.</li>
<li>The finished teaser was intended to be released at the time of the MMO&#8217;s announcement. It likely would have been accompanied by a video of gameplay footage, or possibly with a live hands-on demo depending on when and where it was first revealed.</li>
<li>The logo at the end was based upon the <a title="it's Wikipedia, so it must be right" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros" target="_blank">ouroboros</a>, an ancient symbol of the cyclical nature of the universe. This symbol has great significance to the story of Amalur, a world trapped in an unending cycle of creation and destruction. And yes, we had this symbol before the Elder Scrolls Online announced using a similar logo (that&#8217;s what you get for basing your IP on classic themes).</li>
<li>The illustrated style showcased in the teaser was something you would have seen throughout the game. Our cinematics team was packed with amazing illustrators, and we were using animation like this to introduce our races and tell little bits of history you&#8217;d encounter as you traveled through Amalur.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seeing this video posted online gives me a mix of emotions. On the one hand, I love this teaser and am very proud of the work it represents. On the other hand, it makes me sad to be faced once more by what could have been.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to get these points across because it would be unfair to the cinematics or audio teams for anyone seeing this to think it represented a final version of a trailer. Even though it&#8217;s really cool, it would have been spectacular by the time we were done with it. I wish you could see it with the same context we did on the inside of the studio, through the eyes of a passionate team that wanted to make something really special.</p>
<p>I still miss that world something fierce.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of today, everyone at 38 Studios Providence and Baltimore has been laid off.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very sad end to nearly six years of great work. Despite the odds, I believed in the dream we all shared. I believed with all my heart.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure the public will ever know the beauty of what we built&#8230; that&#8217;s maybe the hardest part of it all. We snuck out a pretty, but dated, environment fly-through and a few key images, but there is so much more that would take your breath away. I truly hope you get to see it, in some form.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what will happen to Amalur. It will no doubt be tied up in various legal proceedings for some time, both game assets and the intellectual property as a whole.</p>
<p>As people lay blame and the commentators turn a heartbreaking situation into the latest industry punchline, some will probably portray the team as a bunch of screw-ups who couldn&#8217;t ship a game. The story has so, so much more to it than that. In short order, you will start hearing truths, half-truths, and lies, as well as things that are true from a certain perspective. In the end, perspectives are what makes up history&#8230; real truth lies in the midst of it somewhere.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday I&#8217;ll talk more about my perspective&#8230; but not today.</p>
<p>Today, I mourn for what almost was. Because believe it or not, we came <em>so close </em>to pulling it off.</p>
<p>On to the next dream.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m headed down to New York Comic Con this week for a panel scheduled on Friday at 1:30 pm called <a title="Come one, come all" href="http://nycc11.mapyourshow.com/5_0/sessions/sessiondetails.cfm?ScheduledSessionID=1BAFC8" target="_blank">Creating a World Worth Saving</a>. I&#8217;ll be joining our own Creator of Worlds, R.A. Salvatore, plus Andrew Auseon and Ian Frazier from the <a title="Hey, you can preorder it" href="http://www.reckoning.com" target="_blank">Reckoning</a> team. We&#8217;ll talk both theory and practice of how you develop a world meant to span a whole ecosystem of products, and in specific about how we used those principles to craft the narrative of the RPG.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still <em>slightly </em>too early to reveal hard facts about our MMO, but I&#8217;ll sneak some storyline tidbits in there. Until our PR guy tackles me and drags me from the stage, that is.</p>

The theme of the panel is &#8220;MMO Development: Year Two.&#8221; It&#8217;s a follow-up to last year&#8217;s panel in which we talked about, uh, year one of the studio.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I&#8217;m headed back to the Big Apple with several 38 Studios cohorts to take part in a <a title="hells yeah" href="http://www.tentonhammer.com/node/62128" target="_blank">panel discussion</a> at <a title="NYCC" href="http://www.nycomiccon.com/App/homepage.cfm?moduleid=2577&amp;appname=100453" target="_blank">New York Comic Con</a>. The theme of the panel is &#8220;MMO Development: Year Two.&#8221; It&#8217;s a follow-up to last year&#8217;s panel in which we talked about, uh, year one of the studio.</p>
<p>So this raises the question of exactly why we&#8217;re travelling to the heart of Yankee country when we&#8217;ve made clear that we&#8217;re not going to unveil the details of Copernicus this year. Well, first of all, Ten Ton Hammer asked us to do it and we like those guys. Second, it gives the MMOG fan a peek behind the curtains at how development works. Finally, its Comic Con! We&#8217;re geeks at heart and love to soak it all in.</p>
<p>If you happen to be attending the show and would like to say hello, our panel starts at 1:45pm on Saturday. I&#8217;ll be wearing my <a title="You know you want to see it" href="http://the-adventurers-club.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/adam_hughes_power_girl3_1.jpg" target="_blank">Power Girl</a> costume.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="If you don't like what you read at Massively, wait 3 minutes and they'll have a new article up" href="http://www.massively.com/2008/07/30/comic-con-08-38-studios-interview-reveals-ip-announcement-next/" target="_blank">Massively has posted their interview with 38 Studios</a>, featuring Mary Kirchoff (VP of Marketing) and Thom Ang (Art Director).</p>
<p>This article is largely focused on marketing and big-picture plans for the studio. I thought Mary had a couple really good quotes, such as this response to why we&#8217;re doing a fantasy game:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our other perspective on fantasy is that it&#8217;s the most globally accepted medium for conveying epic stories. It&#8217;s accepted over the broadest number of categories in book publishing, which is one of the categories we&#8217;re going to develop our intellectual property inside. We want consumers to enjoy that experience of being in the world 24/7 in different contexts. Fantasy delivers to a global, broad market – just like 38 Studios.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As for when the game name and more detail on the IP will be forthcoming, Mary talked about that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our current plan is to announce the name of the game and launch the IP website (as opposed to the corporate website) about this time next year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the phrase &#8220;our current plan.&#8221; A lot can change in a year, so don&#8217;t get too worked up if those plans change.</p>
