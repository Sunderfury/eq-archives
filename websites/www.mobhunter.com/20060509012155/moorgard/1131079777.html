The fact that the world will be bigger than EQ originally was. To be honest, I was a bit worried that Norrath might be <I>smaller,</I> given the amount of graphic detail involved. But it sounds like the world will be plenty big enough to run around in for some time.<p>As promised, here are a couple screen shots:<p><TABLE border="0"><TR><TD><a href="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/Befallen11.jpg"><IMG SRC="http://www.linkdead.com/temp-images/Befallen11s.jpg"></a></TD><TD><H5>Remember the first time you zoned into Befallen?

Uh, the picture--not the interview. There's another slightly less creepy (but no less impressive) <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/screens/0,10865,2863471-2,00.html">picture of a lab</a>, too.<p>Most of the details of the interview have been covered already, but we'd like to highlight a couple points. Trost spells out the reasoning for changing the way characters are created and developed:<p><B>We want to present information at a more measured pace so that every time players are asked to make a meaningful decision, they are fully aware of and understand the options that are available to them and how it will impact their play style. We plan on supporting a staggering number of customization options, from purely aesthetic choices like skin tone to game-impacting choices such as skill specialization. One of our goals is that, at any given time, we are only asking players to contemplate five or so options, so they do not feel overwhelmed at any single decision point but end up with a very deep and highly personalized character.</B><p>Trost also gave the following detail on EQ2's development:<p><B>EverQuest II has been in the planning stages since just before The Ruins of Kunark shipped, but actual development started about two years ago. The team of 39 people has been fully staffed for the past year and a half.</B><p>One of the more controversial features is that banks will be local instead of global. That is, you don't have one magic bank account that you can access in any city. Trost revealed that perhaps this decision is not set in stone:<p><B>Banking is also something that is likely to shake out in testing. We have some interesting ideas, but it remains to be seen how much fun they are. If something isn't fun, we will change it.</B><p>On paper, EQ2 sounds like a fantastic game. But bear in mind that it will be at least 18 months before we have it in our hands, and a lot can change during that time--including the arrival of some equally impressive competition.<p>It's an interesting time to be an MMORPG player, and it looks like the future will only be moreso. And we like that.
