Right now we're working on fixing any remaining bugs and features. Keep beating it up and sending us bugs and feature requests and we'll get it ready as fast as we can.</B><p>Notice the technospeak there--<I>working on fixing any remaining bugs <B>and</B> features.</I> Methinks Alan has been hanging around coders too long! That reminds me of the VW Beetle with the personalized plate that read FEATURE.<p>Programmers are such geeks, I swear.<p>Anyway, since the UI and Bazaar are in testing and are clearly going to go live soon enough, I think we can afford waiting a bit longer to make sure they get 'em right. So all you proddies should do as Alan asks and log on to Test to make sure those new &quot;features&quot; are working as intended.<p>Absor also tackled some <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000618.html">specific issues</a> with the Bazaar code, answering a few more player questions on the matter:<p><I>First, the traders sachels weigh 25 stone empty, that is 200 stone in weight before anyone even puts objects into them....How will characters be able to move with full packs?<p>Second...what if I want to sell 10 slot tailor made backpacks, or smithed tool kits, or any other containers? Can containers be placed in containers in /trader mode?</I><p><B>Weight isn't an issue in the Bazaar. When people carrying too much weight started to die going down a step, we took out a lot of the restrictions for weight in that zone. <p>Bags can't go into bags. There are two reasons for this. One is that it would lead to infinite storage capacity. Just as importantly, putting containers inside containers was known to cause the world to collapse back when it was possible (all sorts of 'bad things' would happen to characters and their stuff). And, well, nobody really wants that.</B><p><I>For the PoTC quest there is a great demand for foraged items so my first thought was to try and sell these.<br>If I set my character to sell food will the character starve or eat his/her profits away?<p>Does the old rule of the food in the first inventory slot being eaten first still apply?</I><p><B>As far as I know, your character will continue to eat in the normal fashion. So you might have to worry about eating yourself out of business. At least folks selling baked goods will be eating well while they work.</B><p><I>Are items only in the trade satchels available for people to buy?<p>What if you have something in the bag that you forgot to price, will that be sellible for some default price?<p>Do the bags have to be in your inventory or can they be in the bank?</I><p><B>Only items in trade satchels can be sold, and those satchels must be on a character that is standing in a stall. So, no, you can't sell things that are in the bank, and you'll have to remember to get the items you want to sell into a satchel and priced.</B><p>That Bazaar is one complicated little bugger! No wonder it's taking so long to get it working. I just hope they leave a couple l337 bugs in place so I can bolster my bank account by selling duped fungus tunics. That would be w3rd.<p><BIG>Check Your Settings, Mr. Data</BIG><p>Over the years there has been much debate about the correct value for the DataRate.txt file in the EverQuest directory. The default setting is 5.0, which was designed to work well with the dial-up connection that was the standard at the time of EQ's release.<p>With the explosion of broadband, of course, many users have advocated bumping this number up considerably, even going so far as to recommend a value of 20.0 or more, believing that even if the setting didn't go that high, at least you would get the maximum throughput you could. Turns out this thinking was entirely inaccurate.  Finally, we have the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/027976.html">definitive word</a> from Verant's Technical Help forum:<p><B>You set your Datarate.txt to 20? Well, my amp goes to 11.<p>0-9 is the range for datarate.txt. At 20, EQ will just use the default of 5.<p>Regards,<br>Victor Wachter<br>Sony Online Entertainment</B><p>Okay, so those of us with DSL and cable modems should make sure we change our DataRate.txt file to 9.0--pronto. You just might find your connection has become more stable.<p>It's nice to know that the Verant tech guys have good taste in <a href="http://www.spinaltap.com/home.html">movies</a>, too.<p><BIG>Just in Case Your Graphics Aren't Silly Enough...</BIG><p>I love most all of the new Luclin player models. They aren't perfect, and I realize not everyone is crazy about them, but the level of detail is heads and tails above the old models.<p>One of the things I miss about the old ones, though, is the greater variety of armor looks available. Luclin system requirements were already pretty high, so Verant elected not to enable Velious armors and stuck with just one look for each armor type per race.<p>There is, however, a way to see some of the Velious armor with the new models--except it doesn't really work. A player asked for assistance in the Technical Help forum, and the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/027979.html">answer</a> reveals the way to play around with this setting:<p><B><I>Rulz: I'm only seeing the shoulders of SOME of certain races/classes BP's and Tunic's.</I><p>Captain Obvious: This happened to me before. The problem is that if you have ANY luclin graphics on you need to change a line in your eqclient.ini (usually located in c:program fileseverquest) to LoadVeliousArmorsWithLuclin=FALSE. If it's set to TRUE it causes this graphics glitch, probably because they never fixed the luclin model graphics to be able to use velious textures.</B><p>I played around with this setting a couple days ago, in fact. I changed the setting in my eqclient.ini file, then took off my robe and put on some armor that used Velious textures. The results were... interesting.<p><TABLE><TR><TD><IMG SRC="http://www.mobhunter.com/images/screwedarmor.jpg" BORDER=0></TD><TD><I>This is actually the new uniform design featured in the upcoming <B>Star Trek: Nemesis</B> movie. Note the erotic single-bracer look. The only downside is the duck feet, but hopefully they'll have something worked out before the movie premieres. Mmmm, beam me up this hunk, Scotty!</I></TD></TR></TABLE><p>Needless to say, I changed the setting back to FALSE really fast.<p>I have a GeForce 4 Ti4400 with 128 megs of RAM, so it's not like my card should be lacking space to hold all the armor graphics. It would be neat if this could be made to work, at least to give folks who exceed the system requirements an extra display option. Oh well, we'll just add it to our list of things we'd like to see fixed... like the ring of Vulak, inner Acrylia, the hit box on giant worm models, bards... and so forth.<p>Is anybody else ready for another four-day weekend?
