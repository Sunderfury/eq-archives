<html><head><title>It's No Myth</title></head><body><h1>It's No Myth</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-03-26</p><BIG>Gods and Monsters</BIG><p>Along with the Planes of Power Web site, Verant also updated the <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/library/deities.jsp">rollcall of deities</a> that makes up the mythology of Norrath. The list was fairly bare-bones before, but is much fuller now.<p>However, some seemingly conflicting lore about these godly critters has readers confused, so Absor attempted to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000528.html">shed some light</a> on the seeming incongruities:<p><B>The EverQuest world is very large, well defined, and has a ton of lore. But when history is written by individuals with agendas there can be a conflict in that lore. Such things are not wrong, or even bad, for a game world. Quite the opposite is true, especially in a shared game space like EverQuest. The idea that Dark Elves and High Elves can argue all day about the truth of the origins of life, or that Gnolls believe themselves to be children of Brell - something that a Dwarf would disagree with using the blade of an axe, all add to the depth of the world. The truth in such matters is dependent on the character speaking.<br>...<br>Yes, there are times when the 'reality' of a completed game concept such as a zone or an NPC might conflict with known lore. Some times that is because the people of the world just have the lore wrong. The Gnolls and the Dwarves can't both be right. And some times we change the lore to make a better story or to fit the real needs of game construction. If lore describes, say, a location in such a way that would be unworkable in game, we're going to have to change the lore. That can't be helped. But we strive to make it all make sense. I can't tell you how often we talk about how to mesh lore and gameplay with game mechanics and good old-fashioned story telling.</B><p>Absor is correct; history is all about point of view. That's why in the U.S. we call it &quot;The American Revolution&quot; while the Brits refer to it as &quot;The Revolt of the American Colonies.&quot; History is always written by the survivors and the victors--often very selectively. Holy doctrines work much the same way. Examine any of the world's major religions and you'll find conflicting myths and inconsistencies galore. Norrath's pantheon shouldn't be immune, either.<p>It would be kind of neat to get to some of these planes and find out the gods there aren't exactly what we expected. What if Rallos Zek turned out to be a pacifist, Quellious had become the god of rage, and Erollisi Marr turned out to be cold and distant? It would certainly spice things up on some of those loftly planes, anyway.<p><BIG>So and Slow It Grows</BIG><p>A recent change to the way slow-type spells work is causing a bit of buzz these days. Notice this line from the most recent patch message:<p><B>- Improved the way that Abolish Disease/Poison and Counteract Disease/Poison work</B><p>Seems harmless, right? Well, it turns out that slow spells had a disease counter attached to them. So what? Well, this means you can't dispell slow anymore; you can only remove it with the remedies listed above.<p>So why are some folks <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=10421.topic">up in arms</a> about this change? Well, take a mob like Sontalak for example. He casts an AoE dispell that also hits himself, which in the past meant that any kind of debuff or slow spell that you managed to land on him would be gone in short order. Since slows are now disease-based, it means dispell won't get rid of it--only cure disease will. So now Sont (formerly a pretty badass dragon, btw) is officially <a href="http://209.41.182.75/cgi-bin/ikonboard/topic.cgi?forum=11&amp;topic=2231&amp;replies">neutered</a>. The Arch Lich in Ssra Temple is a gimp. Any mob with an AoE dispell that used to be essentially unslowable is now a weakling. Thus we have some formerly challenging content being trivialized, and some uberfolks don't care for that.<p>This change works in reverse, too. If a mob slows you, a disease cure can take care of it. When fighting a mob that casts an AoE slow, this brings to mind all kinds of tactics for keeping aggro where you want it...<p>Whether Verant will keep slow spells working this way is uncertain. As always, get some mileage out of it while you still can.<p><BIG>Those Dirty Shadowknights Find a New Home</BIG><p>Are you looking for a harmtouch support group, but can't find people who understand you? Maybe that's because the shadowknight message board at Interealms went kaput recently.<p>Don't despair, skeleton lover. An all-new SK forum <a href="http://forums.shadowknight.org/">has opened</a>, and it's even moderated by Xilith from the old site. Now you can talk about your feign death envy problems with people who care.<p><BIG>They Make Money the Old-Fashioned Way</BIG><p>Casters Realm snuck up on John Smedley and got a brief <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4194">interview</a> concerning the monthly price hike. Smed's reasoning goes something like this:<p><B>Over time we've added a substantial amount of new content to the game, and we will continue to do so at a large rate. The development team alone for EQ is currently around 50 people, and that's not even counting the people in operations, customer service and other parts of the company that keep EQ running.</B><p>He's right, of course. Every expansion adds more zones. More zones means more boxes runnning them. More boxes means more space is required to host them, and more backups necessary to keep data secure.<p>However, I <I>still</I> think think that a 25% price hike has more behind it than just covering costs. Some SOE executive needs a new summer house or a speedboat or something.<p>As for the notion of &quot;copying&quot; DAoC's pricing structure, well, there's a general principle in business that you don't want to undervalue your own product. If your competitor successfully sells an inferior product for more money than you sell yours, then why the hell shouldn't you raise your price? I'd expect Star Wars: Galaxies to be even more expensive--$15 range or so--based on the perceived value of the license. You think Star Wars geeks are going to squabble over whether they pay $13 or $15 to polish Darth Vader's boots? Think again.<p>But in any case, I'll gladly pay more money per month to play EQ if Verant will just do one simple thing for me: <B>DON'T RAISE THE LEVEL LIMIT WITH PLANES OF POWER!!!</B> Thanks for listening.
