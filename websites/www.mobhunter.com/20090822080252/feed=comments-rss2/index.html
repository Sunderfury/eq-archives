		<description>Or, perhaps a mushroom is just a mushroom, and you&#039;re seeing what you secretly want to see there?

Some people claimed &lt;i&gt;Meridian 59&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gilcon.net/meridian/Reagent-get.asp?ID=11&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;revamped mushroms&lt;/a&gt; were phallic in nature.  I just didn&#039;t see it, myself.  And, I&#039;ve seen a lot of pixel pe... er, I mean, uh...  It just isn&#039;t.</description>

		<description>I can offer you free booze that I won&#039;t be buying at a party I won&#039;t be hosting. Eating steak, I think, when there are free parties... well, that may be a mistake. Unless you want to drink like twice as much in order to not remember the steak.</description>

		<description>Mycophallomorphic transformation.

Plenty of art has layouts or structure that seem to have sexualised overtures to them, if you look past the immediate image, perhaps the subconcious expresses things through form sometimes, though this is usually a lot less overt than what you describe, which appears to be deliberately humourous to illustrate some artistic point, or maybe to just get a laugh.</description>
