These changes are almost enough to make me play a caster... almost.<p><big>Bane of My Existence</big><p>Also on Test server, a player in the guise of an orc priest <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8587.topic">noticed</a> that his weapon had a new line in the description:<br><small><B>Bane DMG: Undead +3.</B></small><br>This confirms statements made by Verant way back at Minneapolis FanFaire, when they <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-395476026">told us</a> that Luclin would introduce situational weapons with bane-like bonuses against specific mob types.<p>We think bane weapons are a cool idea--just so it doesn't get overdone. I mean, I really don't want my bank and backpacks filled with dozens of weapons that only get used once in a while. I have enough armor like that already, thanks.<p><big>How Do You Like Your Retribution Now?</big><p>In more lighthearted news, a wizard at a recent GM event got to thank Al'Kabor in person for providing his class with so many lovely translocate spells:<p><small><B>[Sun Nov 04 16:10:34 2001] You begin casting Retribution of Al'Kabor.<br>[Sun Nov 04 16:10:39 2001] Al`Kabor is frozen by the retribution of Al'Kabor.</B></small><p>That <I>had</I> to feel good. Read the whole <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=8325.topic">account</a> to see what spells land on the pesky wizard, should you ever get the chance to thank him yourself.<p><big>Could You Manage My Mutual Fund, Too?</big><p>With Luclin on the horizon, it's time to get into the futures market. Past expansions have had a huge impact on the player economy, and SoL will be no exception.<p>A post over at the Shaman's Crucible details some <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=0cd3e7eeed2be22749ceaa0762880d45&amp;threadid=17467">predictions</a> that we feel have a lot of merit. A few highlights include:<p><small><B>Platinum will be at a premium. With the new horsies coming out every uber player and his dog will want a best of the best steed upon which to ride on. I think they said the prices will be 5-15k per horse which will show a huge reduction in the ammount of platinum on any server. <p>Huge drop in price of weapons. We have already seen the market flooded. For instance right now a Yak is about 300-400p, and a lamentation is down to 4-5k with bloodpoints 6-8k. Look for these weapon prices to drop in half. Weapons are always the first to go down quickly in value. <p>Temporary increase in the value of gems. I belive that either a new type of metal with increased stats will be coming out, or gems will be combined with armorcraft/tailoring for some really nice armor. So hold onto your jacinth, BS, diamond, and BD. The increase will be great for about 3-4 months as everyone tries to upgrade. On the other side watch the value of velium jewlry drop down to pretty much cost. <p>All armor will see a drop of about 25% in value, however it wont be as bad as weapons. Look for armor with high resists to keep some of their value. However for the stuff at the uber high priced level (Lodizal shields, Kunark bp&amp;legs) look for these items to drop to lower than half of their asking price.<p>What to look for in the new velious stuff (i.e. what to jump on):<p>1. Anything with effects is going to be the high demand stuff. This is especially true for spells that a class cannot cast or any damage dealing stuff. <p>2. Items with high resists. Watch resists get even more important so anything with resists especially magic will go up significantly in value.<p>Stay away from the latest weapons, they wont be that much of a difference and everyone is gonna want a premium early on. Also any items with funky looks are going to be overpriced initially just for newness/fashion sense.</B></small><p>Good, common-sense stuff there. Stick with solid investments and you won't go wrong. Guess there's not much difference between stock brokers and item farmers after all.<p><big>I'm Ready for My Closeup, Mr. DeNizzmo</big><p>Want to be a star of stage and screen? Would you settle for screen? Okay, here's your audition.<p>Nizzmo, the famous dancing gnome, is making another <a href="http://www.tahnlu.com/soon/trailer.html">movie</a>, and he's giving you your <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=25853.topic">chance</a> to shine:<p><small><B>Sunday, November 11th. 12pm Pacific. 3pm Eastern.<p>On the Fennin ro Server. Bring your Gnome to Steamfont Mountains. If you're not on the Fennin ro Server. Feel free to create, a Level one Gnome named after you, and hang out during this Event.<p>I am aiming to get 100-200+ Gnomes in the Zone (sure it may crash. But we'd all go down in the history books for flooding the Zone with Gnomes)</B></small><p>If there's ever a good reason to crash a zone, this is it. Hey, maybe the Mobhunter boys will show up and lend a hand. After all, we need our egos fed too, ya know.<br>
