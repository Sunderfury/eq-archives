<html><head><title>Hell Freezes Over</title></head><body><h1>Hell Freezes Over</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-12-20</p><BIG>Bye Bye, Miss UI Pie</BIG><p>Some major changes are on their way to the face of EverQuest. Just announced on the EQ Live site, the user interface is undergoing something of a <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53400">metamorphosis</a> in several key areas:<p><B>After much faithful service, it's time for us to bid a fond farewell to EverQuest's Classic and Velious user interfaces.&nbsp; In yesterday's Test Server patch, the old interfaces were disabled.<p>While adding many features to the new interface over the past six months, including the built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, and enhanced /bug reporting tool, we've done the best that we could to keep all three interfaces, at the very least, usable.<p>However, some of the features that we've been quietly working on over the past weeks have unfortunately forced our hand.&nbsp; <p>We don't want to spoil all of the upcoming changes at once, however, in yesterday's Test Server update, we released the first run of the new EverQuest windowed mode that's been in the works for quite some time now.&nbsp; (In a game that was originally written for a much earlier version of DirectX, it's a lot more work than many would think.)&nbsp; Soon, it will behave in a manner similar to other applications that support both full-screen and windowed mode and can be toggled back and forth.&nbsp; As a part of this change, the account bans related to the use of third-party EverQuest windowing applications have already been reversed.<p>In addition, the long-rumored &quot;Bard Box&quot; has also been revealed on the Test Server.&nbsp; For those who are not aware, we've been wanting to add a second Effects window that would hold selected short-duration beneficial effects, most notably many bard songs.&nbsp; Initially, for tuning, the new effects area will allow six additional songs to be placed upon your character.&nbsp; <p>These updates will remain on the Test Server only until after the new year, as we expect that much additional testing will be required.</B><p>Personally, I think the addition of a windowed interface is terrific news, and most players seem <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=23795.topic">generally supportive</a>. There's no good reason anymore not to run EQ in a window. Granted, you could do this already by using the EQWindows program, but an official solution is very long overdue.<p>There is a downside, of course. The official windowed method reportedly doesn't allow multiple clients to run at once, so those folks using EQW to keep a Bazaar mule or a porter up while on another character will be out of luck. Since using EQW doesn't seem to be illegal anymore, though, I'm sure someone will figure out a solution.<p>Bards are <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=16075.topic">pleased</a> with the new short-duration buff window that was added to the UI, which means bard songs will no longer take up buff space (or interfere with buff arranging). While the regular buff window remains at 15 slots, this new window adds another 6, which should be plenty for most everyone. Clerical heal-over-time spells will benefit as well.<p>Anytime the bard class gets <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/West/12/19/monkey.pants.reut/index.html">monkeyed with</a>, expect them to be broken completely very soon. I'm convinced that's just part of the thrill of playing a bard, though.<p>The departure of the old UI is no big loss. While the new UI was buggy and caused much crashing when it first came out, it's far more stable now and much more robust overall. If you haven't made the switch yet, you should certainly do so.<p>There is a bit of <a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=23798.topic">concern</a> over some of the Test changes, though. In addition to visual modifications, a new character file format is in the works as well. This has apparently caused some odd effects, such as the loss of stat points, character skills becoming inaccessible, and more. Clearly this stuff will be in testing a while before it goes live, so don't panic yet. That's what Test is for, after all.<p><BIG>To Arm(or)s! To Arm(or)s!</BIG><p>As mentioned yesterday, PoP quest armors received upgrades in the patch. Effects and spells were added to many pieces, some useful and some not. Well, someone at SOE posted on the EQ Live site that these <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=53398">effects will be evaluated</a> and possibly changed:<p><B>We've been looking over the PoP class armor effects that went to live servers today, and we're likely to make changes to a few pieces.&nbsp; We'll evaluate the armor sets and see about getting any changes onto the Test Server before Christmas break.&nbsp; Please keep this in mind before you make a great effort to acquire any planar class armor, as the effects on it may change.</B><p>That's good news, because some of the armor effects are legitimately dookie.<p>We wonder who it was that posted this little nugget on the live site. Absor didn't sign it. Hartsman didn't sign it. Fess up, Verant freaks! And how long of a Christmas break do these guys get, anyway?<p><BIG>Hammer Time</BIG><p>Also on the EQ Live site we have another <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/hammerfel.jsp">update from Hammerfel</a>, a.k.a. Web guru Nathan Pearce. Hammy is once again up on his stump, preaching that people should subscribe to the EverQuest newsletter. A December edition is coming soon.<p>Why should you subject yourself to this occasional spam? Well, remember that Pearce can be a bit sneaky. This is the guy who &quot;accidentally&quot; posted a picture of his office that happened to have a Planes of Power background image on his desktop before the expansion was announced. He also broke the news of EverQuest 2 through hidden links in the text of a previous newsletter. So we suspect that if he's encouraging people to subscribe, there could be some big news tucked away somewhere in the newsletter.<p>As we anticipate another expansion to be announced soon, we wouldn't be surprised if a trail of breadcrumbs leads in that direction. We don't, however, think that whole Lost Dungeons of Norrath business is it--more likely that's going to be some kind of single-player or standalone product. Nor does the <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=24176d2ea14a8afaee1f3c29f47fcff6&amp;threadid=4378">Kingdom of Serilis</a> seem likely, but we don't know anything for sure. As globe watchers are fond of pointing out, there are still more continents on Norrath, after all.<p>Planes of Power was a success. EQ2 is likely still a year away. If another expansion isn't announced soon, I will eat my hat. Or better yet, some of the gross things they serve on <I>Fear Factor.</I><p>Where does one obtain a pig's rectum, anyway? If anyone would know, it has to be a Mobhunter reader.
