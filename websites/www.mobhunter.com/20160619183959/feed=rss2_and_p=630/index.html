		<description><![CDATA[Coray, You have a blog? that was a pleasure to read.

I agree with the points about EQ, everything these days seems too easy. What&#039;s the fun in that? I remember early in EQ2(never played EQ1) you could tell the good players from the bad by just looking. Shiny armour, particle effects etc. Those were the days..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since you didn&#039;t ask and you don&#039;t write anymore *sadface* here&#039;s my review of Rift and some thoughts about good MMORPGs.  

Rift is to WoW what WoW was to EQ, it takes what comes before it and tries to condense it down and streamline things.  In terms of release RPGs it&#039;s been pretty solid, there aren&#039;t a ton of bugs.

The biggest change over WoW and previous games is the class system, four archetypes which each have like 8 &#039;souls&#039; or subspecialties.  You can have four (or maybe more) Roles which each contain 3 souls so you can mix and match and you can switch between roles instantly, letting you go from a DPS spec to a Tank spec and even Healer spec very easily.  This alleviates the problem of needing certain classes, like waiting on a cleric or warrior before you do something.

The other big difference are Rifts and world invasions.  Basically from time to time portals open up and you can do waves of an event for items, money and experience.  This is the main source of danger (roving groups of higher mobs) and can be fun although they can also be a pain (overall it balances out).

The gameplay is seamless but linear.  You are steered from area to area via quests and they will pretty much always be kill that, collect this etc.  In each &#039;zone&#039; or area there is so far around one quest that is marked for a group of 3+ people, and one quest that involves the dungeon in the area, otherwise all things can be done by yourself.

The dungeons so far have been similarly linear, you move from point A to B killing some trash in the way and then fight a boss, repeat x 4 and you&#039;re done.  The bosses are interesting and have a lot of varied mechanics but I have never died in a dungeon.

Progression is quick, the game releases today and was opened 5 days ago and people reached the level cap in less than 3 days.  Having played a little in the last beta I found that when the head start came it was huge to simply know where the quests required you to go, which quests could be done at the same time etc and I&#039;m already over level 30.

Overall the game is polished and appears like it&#039;s going to be very successful, probably #2 behind WoW but ultimately I&#039;m a little dissappointed.

First, I gotta say that I kind of dislike how games give out seemingly nice items left and right these days and how regular items and awesome items all look the same.  You can be geared completely from quests and have decent gear as a result, you will never have to camp anything that I&#039;ve seen and everyone pretty much looks the same from the guy who has all quest gear to someone who has multiple superior dungeon items.  I still remember seeing people with Bronze armor in EQ and being like oh my god where did they get that awesome item!?  Bronze and Rubicite armor were freaking trash but it was the best we got and seemed crazy good at the time.  I want to live in a world where +1 strength means something and Rift isn&#039;t that world.  You&#039;ll have +9 strength items falling from the sky at like level 15.  Granted they may similar be viewed as complete garbage when at level 50 you have +100 strength items but I don&#039;t expect to ever have a sense of something to look forward to.

On the looks side, every piece of armor looks the same, I could pry a sword from the depths of a dungeon and it&#039;ll look the same as one from some quest where I pick 5 flowers.  When I see other players I have no sense of what level they are, I never wonder what item that is and where did they get it, it&#039;s just a bunch of grey or brown people.  

Next up is the linear nature of the game.  While it is good in some aspects like you never don&#039;t know what you need to do next, it becomes pretty boring sometimes.  In particular an area that bothers me are the dungeons.  They are all instances and you never see other groups, camp or have much of a challenge.  Everyone ends up doing the dungeon for that level range and then moving on to the next one on a race to the end.

And as noted that race is short.  I didn&#039;t get to play as much as I wanted over the weekend and I&#039;m level 30.  I feel like I am ahead of the curve as I see very few players in the areas I am in, but suffice it to say you were not level 30 after a weekend in EQ.  It took a long time to reach 50 in EQ and while it doesn&#039;t necessarily have to take that long, people should not be 50 before you even release the game.  Serious guilds are probably full of 40+ players and by next weekend will start to tear up their end game content. While Trion apparently has plans to add more end game content they are likely to be behind.

Lastly we have the social aspect.  Rift is the complete opposite of EQ.  You join and leave groups left and right but basically everyone operates like we&#039;ll work together for this and then I have shit to do.  You rarely have any sort of interaction, you join up to fight a Rift, you beat it, you immediately disband and run off to do a quest.  The only times people look for a group is when a quest requires it or for dungeons.  Those times are not much different, it&#039;s let&#039;s meet here to kill this, and then immediately everyone leaves.

I am 100% for the capability to solo and play a fun game without having to invest a ton of time, as many times that&#039;s what I want to do, log on for 30 minutes and accomplish something but I don&#039;t think these things are as mutually exclusive as recent game developers appear to think.  You can have all of the linear questing, linear dungeons etc but you could then have dungeons at each level that are not instanced and let groups go there and just fight for experience and superior items.  This is especially annoying because why come up with a system where people can switch between roles so easily in order to make groups, but then build a game that encourages you to never talk to another human?

Lastly there is little new ground broken here.  The game is pretty much the biggest cliche in MMORPG history.  The areas for the Guardian side can accurately be described as Forest Area, Haunted Area, Desert Area, Wasteland Area.  The quests are all meaningless killing 7 of these, collecting 5 of those type things.  They sometimes string a few together to form a &#039;Story&#039; but every damn story involves killing 12 things, then collecting 5 things then killing some trivial mob.  

That all being said it is a good game and people will enjoy playing it, it just isn&#039;t THE game.  The one I&#039;m sure Moorgard is busy making, right?]]></description>
