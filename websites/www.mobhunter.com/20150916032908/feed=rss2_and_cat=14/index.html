<p>I&#8217;m also terrified, because I&#8217;ll be on stage in front of several thousand people to talk during a small portion of the keynote speech. I love doing panels, but standing in the spotlight of the big stage is another thing altogether. It&#8217;s early in the morning on Friday, so with any luck I&#8217;ll be too tired to be nervous. Sadly, though, Vegas and luck don&#8217;t usually go hand in hand for me.</p>
<p>These shows are a ton of work, but seeing the reaction of the fans makes it all worth it. I know that sounds cliche, but it&#8217;s actually true. So come say hi if you&#8217;re there, I&#8217;d love to chat!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve heard about Blizzard&#8217;s RealID system, and have seen <a title="Lum provides all the links you need" href="http://brokentoys.org/2010/07/07/realid-scare-mongering-from-a-lot-of-people-with-funny-names/" target="_blank">many of the opinions against the upcoming change</a> to WoW&#8217;s forums.</p>
<p>I think the move is lousy too, for most of the same reasons others have stated. I think ultimately the change is dangerous, both to the customers and to the health of the community. And I say this as someone whose &#8220;real ID&#8221; has been a matter of public record for a number of years now.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another aspect to this I&#8217;d like to talk about which I haven&#8217;t seen discussed so far.</p>
<p>My instinct is that this change will peel away yet another layer of the magic of MMOs: that of being able to pretend you&#8217;re someone else. Sure, anonymity can empower jerks to act like even bigger jerks, but the illusion of the avatar also does great things. It allows disabled gamers to ignore their physical limitations; it allows the meek to act with confidence; it allows the person with an average job and an average life to become a legend.</p>
<p>The danger of connecting MMOs too closely with real life is that it takes away the game&#8217;s function as a vehicle of escape, perhaps even limiting the potential of the game to inspire the imagination. That&#8217;s a heavy price to pay for cutting down on forum spam.</p>
<p>Of course the message boards are technically separate from the game itself, but they represent a big part of the MMO experience for a sizable number of players. That connection is being impacted by the RealID change, which means yet another aspect of the classic MMO experience is being lost&#8211;if you&#8217;re a WoW player, at least.</p>
<p>Now, let me pontificate to MMO developers for a minute.</p>
<p>From personal experience, I know that keeping a gaming forum as useful and troll-free as possible is a huge pain in the ass. Guess what? It&#8217;s also the price you pay for coming to the dance. I don&#8217;t care how big your community is or how many posts you have to moderate&#8211;hire the freaking staff to do the job right. I understand the motive of wanting to create a cleaner environment for your posters, but don&#8217;t take the positive experience away from the good folks in the name of shutting up the asshats.</p>
<p>There is a certain charm in the forum hero known only by a clever handle. The MMOs of tomorrow need to hold onto all the charm they can, not let it slip away&#8211;regardless of the motive.</p>

It allows disabled gamers to ignore their physical limitations;  it allows the meek to act with confidence; it allows the person with an  average job and an average life to become a legend.</span></div>

<p>Anyway, I spent part of my weekend on a panel at the inaugural <a title="Arguably one of the worst designed websites you'll ever see" href="http://www.gameunicon.com/" target="_blank">GameUnicon</a> here in Massachusetts. I was joined by my cohort <a href="http://www.nerfbat.com/">Shwayder</a> and <a title="No, not the BBC chap, although he is British" href="http://elvishparsley.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Justin Webb</a> from <a title="The OTHER MMO developer in Maynard" href="http://www.tencentboston.com/" target="_blank">Tencent Boston</a>. We had an excellent discussion with the seven people in the audience (only one of which was a spouse!).</p>
<p>As proof of our awesomeness at the event, here is a video that Justin and Angela put together.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On RPG Vault, FusionFall&#8217;s Rich Weil outlines a lot of the reasons <a title="or should I say wishy washy" href="http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/962/962114p1.html" target="_blank">community management is a much more nebulous position</a> in online gaming than many other development roles. <a title="Talks more about community than most community managers" href="http://www.brokentoys.org/2009/03/13/warcraft-killed-the-community-star/" target="_blank">Lum</a> (honorary community manager) and <a title="Likes to use the word &quot;weenies&quot;" href="http://eatingbees.brokentoys.org/2009/03/13/go-read-this-well-talk-about-afterwards/" target="_blank">Sanya</a> discuss the article and agree with most of what Rich says, and there&#8217;s not much in the piece that I would argue about either.</p>
<p>But I think there&#8217;s more to this general misunderstanding about community management than a lack of metrics or solid job descriptions. The profession also lacks a sense of history.</p>
<p>If you want to judge a designer, artist, or coder on a game he or she has worked on, you can (usually) pick up the game and evaluate it for yourself, or at the very least do some digging into reviews and feedback on the particular aspects of the game linked to this person&#8217;s efforts. To evaluate the work of a community manager, what are you going to do&#8211;dig through years of forum posts? Search out fansite interviews? Google for vague impressions?</p>
<p>The very nature of community management is that it&#8217;s <em>of the moment</em>. These moments have a cumulative effect for members of the community&#8211;they either develop a sense that the community team is listening and actively working on their behalf or decide they&#8217;re useless corporate shills&#8211;but beyond the realm of the player base and dev team, the community manager has a hard time making a clear impression. Unless you were a member of the relevant community at the time, there is little chance you&#8217;ll know anything more than third-hand rumors about what Abashi did to piss off players, or what Sanya did to make the Camelot Herald kick ass, or what Moorgard did or didn&#8217;t say about frogloks. You can read random insinuations posted on message boards by those who may or may not have been there, but often those recollections are made through the hazy veil of selective memory.</p>
<p>So we&#8217;re talking about a profession that not only lacks standardized tools, job descriptions, and advancement opportunities (is there a pure community job in gaming anywhere above the director level?), but where new generations of community managers can barely get a sense of what their predecessors have done right or wrong.</p>
<p>Sure, I suppose if someone comes up with a formula for measuring exactly how a community manager&#8217;s efforts impact specific aspects of a particular product, those metrics would help justify the position to those who doubt its value, but we&#8217;ll never entirely get away from the fact that OCR is indeed a touchy-feely affair (as it should be; if it ain&#8217;t touchy-feely, it ain&#8217;t community). Personally, as much as I&#8217;d like to see the next generation of community managers armed with proper standards and metrics, I&#8217;d just as much like to see them endowed with a real sense of what went before so that they can help guide this discipline to a better future.</p>

A couple of us from 38 Studios will be there in relation to a project called <a href="http://www.azerothadvisor.com/" target="_blank">Azeroth Advisor</a> which you may have <a href="http://www.massively.com/2008/10/03/38-studios-acquires-mmo-newsletter-tailored-to-player-characters/" target="_blank">caught wind about</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be walking the show floor, chatting with gamers and soaking in the sights. And yeah, we&#8217;ll be taking notes so that one day when we have Copernicus fan events, they will be just as exciting as BlizzCon.</p>
<p>Oh, and I want that polar bear!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again: I much prefer fan events over industry gatherings. There is no substitute for meeting players face to face&#8211;even if they&#8217;re not players of a game I&#8217;m working on. So if you see a couple geeks wandering around in 38 Studios gear, be sure to say hello.</p>
<p>Edit: <a title="Wizards. Cyborgs." href="http://www.azerothadvisor.com/public/media" target="_blank">These videos</a> tell you everything you want to know about the Azeroth Advisor newsletter. And more.</p>

<p>This is why, if asked to choose between attending an industry conference or a player-centric event, I&#8217;ll hang with the players every time. During my time on EQ2, there was literally nothing more energizing than attending a Fanfaire and interacting face to face with people passionate about the game. And the best developers on the team always felt the same way.</p>
<p>Love is at the core of community management; love for the players, love for the game, love for the team. Despise any of them and you will burn out and suck at your job.</p>
