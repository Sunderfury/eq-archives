		<description><![CDATA[I hate to say it Steve, but if you have one of these a DAY... you don&#039;t NEED another vice.  Or meals.  Or a snack.  

Maybe eat an apple and some celery and take a boatload of vitamins.  

Unless of course you are running for a couple of hours in the morning or having a good 60 minute martial arts workout every day.  

Or purging.

But it sure does look good...

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Get thee behind me satan!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was glad to see that the classic banana split was considerably healthier than you shake.

Of course, a banana split doesn&#039;t fit in any of the cup holders in my car and I can probably not get away with eating one during a staff meeting.]]></description>
