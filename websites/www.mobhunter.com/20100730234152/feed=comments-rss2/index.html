		<description>Real names is bad.  Even at FanFaires I only used to introduce myself as my character&#039;s name, which gets weird after a couple days but is a whole lot better than someone showing up on my doorstep uninvited.

As ridiculous as it sounds to non-gamers, I think we all know that (sadly) it wouldn&#039;t be long before in-game disputes turned nasty in the real world if some of the crazies had the chance to do it.</description>

		<description>There was some speculation that it&#039;s because of some South Korean law. It seems counter intuitive that having real names out there would be a huge benefit.  Granted people will tend to act different on the forum with their anonymity stripped, but it just provides more information for them to act like jack asses outside of the forum.

I can just imagine how many death threats I would have personally received as a result of a change like this, I&#039;d be able to build a house with the bricks flying through my windows.

I am no lawyer (or am I? You can&#039;t tell because I&#039;m anonymous!), but I believe that Blizzard may be deferring the hassle of monitoring their messageboards in exchange for lawsuits later on when someone uses this information to find someone who ninja looted something.</description>

		<description>Totally agree and very well said. I take a lot of pleasure out of chosing my character name and trying to tie it to some sort of personality and background. Sure, very few people may enquire or appreciate it but it&#039;s all part of the magic of MMOs. I really don&#039;t want to known by my real name in every game I play and every related forum :( Aside from the privacy issues, there really is no fun or escapism in that.</description>

		<description>Looking back at all my favorite video game memories, even the &quot;single player&quot; games, I think a lot of the nostalgic feelings are, like for so many, related to the friendships tied to them.  I remember thoroughly enjoying the experience of playing the first few final fantasies (at least the ones that made it to the states, properly stated are FF1, 4, and 6, though released here as 1, 2 and 3), but my enjoyment wasnt so much because of the games themselves (even though they were all really well done), instead it was the fact that myself, my younger brother, and at least one if not 3 other friends all sat and enjoyed the games together.  It was like one long interactive movie experience, because not only having more eyes meant less was missed, but it was social and fun.  Like watching pro wrestling.  Mostly entertaining on it&#039;s own (assuming you like fight-dramas), but much, much better with friends (and beer).  When the main characters (in the game, or I guess in wrestling) gets through a really tough fight by the skin of their teeth, it&#039;s way more exhilarating when everyone is there feeding that euphoric feeling.

Or that&#039;s my take.  Knowing that makes it easier to go back and play old games, but it&#039;s still never the same.  most times when I want that nostalgic feeling I just turn on one of the soundtracks.  Less disappointment.</description>
