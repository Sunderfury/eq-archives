May Day!</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2002-05-01</p><BIG>Stealthy Patching</BIG><p>We were a bit surprised to receive a patch last night--not a server outage, just a couple of new files. If you watched the download, you noticed a familiar zone name: Vex Thal.<p><B>April 30th, 2002<br>------------------------------<p>- Corrected a couple of graphic corruptions in Vex Thal</B><p>Conspiracy theorists immediately started shouting &quot;Ah-hah! Triton gets into Vex Thal and they finally have to get around to itemizing the zone!&quot;<p>Relax, Scully. As the folks at Graffe's <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=16066.topic">pointed out</a>, the file that we downloaded is indeed only a graphics fix. Itemization is done server-side. Of course, this patch doesn't preclude the fact the the zone <I>might</I> not have been itemized, but we'll probably never know. Unless Triton starts looting a bunch of cloth caps, of course.<p>That would be funny.<p><BIG>Drawing His Own Conclusion</BIG><p>Gamespy is <a href="http://www.gamespydaily.com/news/pressrelease.asp?id=999">reporting</a> that yet another denizen of Norrath has reunited with Aradune:<p><B>San Diego, CA - April 30, 2002 - Sigil Games Online, Inc. announced today that Keith Parkinson, acclaimed artist and game industry veteran, has accepted the position of Art Director. Parkinson, much-lauded for his work both in games and as an artist for the fantasy book and role-playing industry, has reunited with &quot;EverQuest&quot; colleagues Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler as a co-founder of their new company.<p>&quot;Keith is an accomplished artist and creative director with broad experience in books and computer games, and we are honored to have him on board,&quot; said Brad McQuaid, President and co-founder of Sigil Games. &quot;In addition to his talents as an artist, Keith's enthusiasm for massively multiplayer games ensures that he will be able to bring our vision to life.&quot;<p>Among his many responsibilities as Art Director for Sigil Games Online, Parkinson will create and maintain the overall style of each game, contribute to in-house concept art, in-game art, posters, promotional material, and more. In addition, as a Sigil Founder, Parkinson will also contribute to both general and artistic decisions for the company.</B><p><a href="http://www.keithparkinson.com/">Parkinson</a>, of course, did the box art for all EverQuest games and expansions to date. It did seem a bit curious when we found out that the painting at the <a href="http://www.planesofpower.com">Planes of Power</a> Web site wasn't done by Keith, although he did apparently do the <a href="http://www.keithparkinson.com/new/index.html">box art</a>. Interesting that he was brought on as &quot;co-founder&quot; at Sigil, considering the company has been founded for a while now. Hey Brad, could i be a co-founder, too?<p>Whether Parkinson will continue to do projects for Verant on a freelance basis is unclear, but giving him an official position at Sigil and the title of co-founder certainly implies that his work might become exclusive to Brad's new venture. Time will tell.<p><BIG>Hit Me With Your Best Shot</BIG><p>Absor commented on issues with the /hitsmode command. A reader <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000557.html">asked</a> if the command could be changed to allow for all talk in one window and all battle spam in another--something much desired by melee types. The response:<p><B>I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to wait on this one until after the new interface is done. We're holding off any changes regarding windows and text and all that stuff until we're done with it. There's no point in doing all this work twice.</B><p>Understandable, I guess, but the &quot;hurry up and wait for the new interface&quot; responses are getting old. Yeah, we know, there's four programmers on the project, yada yada yada. Just get it working, please.<p><BIG>Hybrid Hijinks</BIG><p>Alan also <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000556.html">addressed</a> the concerns of a paladin who wanted something or another fixed:<p><B>For now I wouldn't expect any changes to hybrid spells or abilities that aren't directly related to pure caster spells or abilities (or bug fixes). The team is concentrating on caster balance right now. When that's complete we'll decide if a pass over hybrids is needed (considering that many changes to casters will likely affect hybrids as well). Fiddling with hybrids and casters at the same time is just not a wise idea.</B><p>Which raises the question: Is it ever a wise idea, Alan? You know very well that paladins won't be happy until they can death touch with one hand and complete heal with the other. Then again, you might want to let the legions of pious halflings and gnomes have a little <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=15403.topic">fun</a>.<p><BIG>A Petition to Stop Petitions</BIG><p>Continuing his posting frenzy, Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000555.html">cautioned</a> message board mavens that the whole notion of class-based petitions isn't really that good an idea:<p><B>We'd much rather have one person send in a good idea than a thousand people send in a list of ideas. The single idea is easier to recognize, easier to discuss, easier to reply to. It's going to be clearer and far less cluttered. A laundry list of ideas is very hard to respond to. A petition that has a dozen suggestions basically requires a reasoned argument in response to each of those suggestions, even if some of the suggestions are obviously bad. The problem here is two-fold. First, we have to spend the time replying to the whole petition rather than just the good ideas. So just about any reply to a petition is going to sound negative, and this makes it generally a bad idea to reply to them. It makes us look mean, when we're really a bunch of teddy bears.</B><p>To which Teddy bears all over the world responded &quot;WTF?? Leave us out of this!&quot; So Absor concluded:<p><B>Comment: Please, if you have an idea about EverQuest that you think will make the game better, send it to us through the Dev Corner.<p>Question: How can the community foster the discussion that produces good ideas without also creating the petitions that seem to be the natural conclusion from those discussions?</B><p>Answer: Pay <I>one person</I> to read all that crap and make a list of the truly valid ideas and give those to the Dev team. That would be a sucky, sucky job, but it might actually pay off. And while I haven't seen Absor's job description posted lately, I kinda thought that's the sort of stuff he gets paid for.<p>That said, we can understand Absor's point here. Most of those EZboard-generated petitions suck the big one. Even relatively successful ones--like the monk board had a while back--still sucked enough that I didn't want to sign my name. Some things that people ask for are just ridiculous. There was a druid petition recently that had some good ideas, but again it was cluttered by goofy stuff that made you just want to scrap the whole deal (which is why Mobhunter never did a story on it, despite nice druids asking us to do so).<p>Oh well. People like big message board petitions because they think the names of a thousand paying customers automatically means that a company has to listen to you. It doesn't. A thousand names signed to a list of bad ideas is still a list of bad ideas. That's probably what Alan <I>really</I> wanted to say but couldn't, so I thought I'd do it for him.<p><BIG>Sowing the Seeds of Love</BIG><p>If you've ever wondered why you stopped playing Ultima Online, a recent newsbit on Gamespy made it clear:<p><B>Ultima Online players may have noticed that seeds and farming (to a small degree) have been implemented on a number of shards. Seeds, which are dropped by certain monsters) can be planted in special pots (used in conjunction with some fresh dirt and a bit of water, of course). This new activity lets you grow a variety of plants, shrubs, trees and herbs (some for decorative purposes and some that are useful for food, healing and magic) You can find a detailed section on seeds at UO Stratics.</B><p>That sounded fun, so we went to UO Stratics to check it out. While we found an unintentionally funny <a href="http://uo.stratics.com/news/GeneralNews.shtml#newsitem1020186408,90961,">article</a> on the subject, we also found the site to be a horribly designed cludge that gave us HTML nightmares just to look at it.<p>At any rate, expect EQ2 to include seeds, planting, farming (crops, not items), and maybe even a bit of hoeing--though the latter will be limited to wood elf females only. We also expect to see character names like &quot;Ganjafarmer&quot; and &quot;Seedspiller,&quot; so get those GM petitions ready.
