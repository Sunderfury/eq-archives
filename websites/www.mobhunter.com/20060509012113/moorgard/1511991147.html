<html><head><title>Every Day is Halloween</title></head><body><h1>Every Day is Halloween</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2001-11-02</p>The <a href="http://pub38.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=16793.topic">fun</a> started on October 31, when several zones were altered--renamed, even--to become the home of new NPCs and GM-run events. Lower-level zones like <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8558.topic">Rathe Mountains</a>, West Commonlands, Qeynos Hills, East Karana, and North Ro saw sweeping changes, while the Ocean of Tears played host to the <a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8554.topic">ghost ship</a> Deep Thro--er--Deep Tomb. Items ranged from things that would make a level 10 druid happy to old school uber items like the Cloak of Flames.<p>I wasn't able to play Halloween night (I was busy egging the neighbors' homes and such), but Kohath visited several of the above zones and had himself quite a time and got some loot that made him happy. Since even Csenicier <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=article&amp;articleid=-192114691">participated</a> in a GM quest, I was feeling left out.<p>Luckily for me, Verant decided to share the love a bit longer. As Absor <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000372.html">pointed out</a>, the powers that be have decided to run events through the weekend. Sure enough, last night I visited West Commonlands and slaughtered werewolves til I was blue in the face. No phat lewtz for me, though I was able to leave a lot of corpses around for others to loot. Plus, it's fun to watch the /ooc complaints about how there are too many level 60 players in zone.<p>While the new NPCs and renamed zones seem to be well received, not everything went smoothly. Some of the GM-run events caused a lot of players grief. For instance, one of our readers <a href="http://www.mobhunter.com/SiteChannelServlet.html?page=msgview&amp;articleid=267865986&amp;msgid=77569045">reported</a> that there was a named dragon in Dreadlands a couple nights ago that was using Trakanon's Touch--a spell that teleports the victim into the middle of the mushroom men in Sebilis. While this usually isn't a big deal for guilds powerful enough to kill Trakanon, it isn't a very nice spell to be using in a zone that is intended for level 35-50 players. Besides that, the dragon was camping the Karnor's Castle zone line, and many casters who had bound in the area found themselves corpse-camped. That's not fun, even if you aren't losing experience with the deaths.<p>Let me give you a personal example. Late last evening, a zone-wide message announced that Cazic-Thule had returned to his temple. Well, that sounded too good to pass up, so a number of my guildmates headed to Feerott to check the place out. After some shenanigans outside that we missed, Cazic headed into the room where his Avatar is usually found. When the 70 or so players in zone headed in, we found a mini-sized CT that was GM controlled dashing about at greater-than-SoW speed and attacking everyone in sight.<p>This CT was a lot different than the NPC version in Fear. The GM version was not only smaller, but hit for a lot less (only around 180) and had a weaker gravity flux. An NPC with those abilities would have fallen to our forces in no time, but the GM version gained some non-standard abilities like complete heal and harm touch, and later in the fight, the dreaded Silence--an AoE spell that neuters casters completely.<p>After effectively eliminating my healers, the GM became more focussed and turned his attention to me, landing three harm touches and chasing me around for a while before he killed me. Which is fine--no exp loss, and you have to expect to die at these things--but there were a few unpleasant issues:<p>1. There was no real storyline, and no real interaction with the GM mob except the fight.<p>2. The event goes on until the GM gets tired of it, and is not dependent upon any logical conclusion or skill on the part of the players. Our forces killed Cazic easily once he stopped CHing himself and silencing the casters, but were powerless to do damage while the GM was excited about slaughtering us.<p>3. Loot on the corpse was snatched up and left to players to distribute. Sorry, but in a GM event this is a bad idea. Thankfully for those in attendance last night, the players who got the kill (props to KoR!) were very fair and allowed one of the drops--a Cowl of Mortality--to be /randomed, but the potential for abuse in these situations is asking for problems.<p>So what needs to change? A storyline is good. A chance for players to use tactics to defeat the enemy is good. And the GM needs to come back as a different character and hand out loot personally to those who helped make the event better. Granted, a lot of GM events are already handled this way, but the ones that aren't just plain suck.<p>Even with the downfalls, it was a fun time, and I look forward to more events over the weekend. In the case of events and zone changes, more = better. Just don't camp the corpses or put players through nasty CRs, please.
