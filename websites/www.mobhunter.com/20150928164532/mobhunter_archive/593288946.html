However, with the release of some of the new features in this patch, such as running EQ in a window, we must now say goodbye to the older interfaces.  They have been disabled as of today.<p>They served us well.<p>** EQ in a Window **<p>EverQuest can now be run in a window.  To place EverQuest in a window, simply press Alt-Enter.  You can also switch out of EverQuest to another program by using the familiar Alt-Tab.  It is important that you do not do this until you are in-game, do not do this during the login process.<p>It is important to note a few things.  Running the game in a window may reduce game performance a bit.  And, as always, the more programs you have running at the same time the more resources they use.<p>At this time, due to some changes that need to be made on the front end, it is not possible to run two instances of EverQuest.  We will be working to make the necessary changes over the next few weeks.<p>** Songs Window **<p>We have added a new window to the interface along with new game functionality.  The Songs window is a new buff window that holds up to 6 bard song buffs.  This increases the potential maximum effects that a character can have to 21 (15 standard and the 6 new ones).  The new window only holds certain bard songs (generally the 3-tick songs).  Only beneficial songs will qualify for the new buff box, and not all of those.  Any buff in the new Songs window is considered temporary and will not be saved when you zone.<p>Songs that qualify to go into the new window will go into that window first.  Any qualifying songs over six will be rerouted to the main Effects window.  Cancel Magic effects will see these new buff slots as buff slots #16-21.<p>Note for User Interface skin creators:  The Label EQTypes 80-85 are the Songs window song names.<p>- Some magical effects on Planar class armor have been altered.  In most cases the effects were upgraded, but a few items were given weaker effects that were more in line with the difficulty of obtaining them.  <br>- Fixed a bug that was causing a few Planes of Power NPCs to take too long to respawn.<br>- Wu's Attack should now work correctly.<br>- Incoming damage now interacts with Wrath of the Wild and other rune-type spells in their proper order.<br>- Pact of Shadow and Shadow Compact will once again heal player characters.<br>- Charmed Pets will no longer remain charmed after the owner dies.<br>- Sending special characters (such as &lt; and &quot;) via EQIM will no longer freeze the game.<br>- Hitting Autoattack when in explore mode at Character Select will no longer cause the game to crash.<br>- The Loadskin window will now load skins other than the default properly.<br>- Fixed and issue that caused some NPC's text to be cut short.<br>- Fixed (but did not rename) the Broken Golem.  He should no longer be hated in Fear, just feared...<br>-Lowered the duration of calm-type spells that effect creatures level 50 and over.<p>** User Interface File Changes **<p>ShortDurationBuffwnd.xml - NEW<br>EQUI.xml<br>BugReportwnd.xml<br>Lootwnd.xml<br>Selectorwnd.xml<br>PetInfownd.xml<br>Window_ Pieces04.tga</B><p>The move to the Luclin interface is finally complete (sure, it's 13 months after SoL was released, but who's counting?). Having EQ officially windowed is nice. While it will inconvenience some that more than one instance of the game can't be run, it's good to know that they do intend to allow this. Sounds like EQW got broken with this patch, but maybe it will be fixed to allow two-boxing on one machine again soon.<p>The new bard window is in--another great change. Anal retentive people (*cough*) will like it that bard songs no longer cause unsightly gaps in their buff lists. I'm hopeful that Verant comes up with other ways to further segregate bards and keep them from mixing with the general population.<p>Chanters went into this patch worried that the nerf bat would hit them hard--after all, they had received <a href="http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=12557.topic">attention</a> for suddenly becoming soloing machines in places like Bastion of Thunder. Happily for them, charm spells went untouched, while changes to lull spells and a fix to charm holding after death have been met with <a href="http://forums.crgaming.com/eqbb/viewtopic.php?t=82085">acceptance</a>. Pacification now lasts seven ticks (42 seconds) instead of seven minutes like it used to.<p><a href="http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=24096.topic">Wizards are pleased</a> about the change to the Broken Golem. Gotta love it when they tune Kunark content in this day and age.<p>Monks are angry over the <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=35856.topic">fix to their Wu's planar skill</a>. It was working a bit too well, and monks pretty much knew this, but they're mostly pissed anyway. Too many nerfs in a row will turn any class bitter--can you say &quot;necromancer&quot;? Maybe it's time for a little monk love before the whining becomes deafening.<p>Oops, too late.<p>Planar armor saw quite a few changes. While not all have been reported yet, <a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=ea799ffadc389a2472f8032f9d315ef6&amp;threadid=4891&amp;pagenumber=4">early reports</a> are promising. Some pieces still have questionable effects, but that doesn't stop people from wanting full sets of the elemental armor.<p>Most of the miscellaneous bug fixes are welcome, though not groundbreaking. The patch did give us one more <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3689&amp;source=Live&amp;setcookie=1">reason to /duel a beastlord</a>, though, so expect emergency follow-up patches soon.<p>Some folks are complaining that this shouldn't have been a ten-hour patch, but it seems to me that there were some pretty substantial changes included here. In any case, the inner workings of patch times remain a mystery to us commoners.<p>As ever, post any hidden patch goodies below or <a href="mailto:moorgard@mobhunter.com">drop me a line</a>. Enjoy patch day!
