We won't go into the latter, but check the original message if you want to fill out a report card on their progress.<p>Here's the meat of Alan's post:<p><B>Stuff in the works, some of these will be fixed with the next patch (in no particular order, most are priority one for the person working on them): <p>- Reducing loading and zoning times (Note: we have a possible improvement for this on the Test server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have it fixed Live soon)<br>- There is a very short pause for some players when other players enter a zone (Note: we have a possible fix for this on the Test server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have it fixed Live soon)<br>- Crashes occurring for some people when logging in<br>- Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing that character<br>- Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound configurations.<br>- Some systems have mouse pointers which are being lost or duplicated<br>- Characters changing to wolf form look tiny<br>- Some spells (mostly 'bolt' spells) not displaying effects<br>- Faces that sometimes don't remain as selected<br>- New Necromancer group debuff spells are not working/displaying properly (all fixed at this time except for Mind Wrack)<br>- A few players are being disconnected at random<br>- Partial transparencied NPCs are still showing up half invisible/behind things they're supposed to be in front of.<br>- Wizard pet buff spells do not appear to be functioning properly<br>- Druid pets, either charmed or 55 castable, cannot be buffed<br>- Familiars die when the wizard cast invisibility. When this happens no harm comes to the wizard, but the plan it to have them remain when the caster is invisible<br>- Luclin ports trying to take people that don't have Luclin (or the Luclin portal stone fragment) and dumping them at the 'safe point' in the zone<br>- Spell Reinforcement: Only the person who has the AA has their buffs last longer. There is no change in the most practical case: A person with the AA buffing another person. The other person does not get the added time<br>- Slow framerate on some fast computers*<p>*Every bug has its story. This one begins as an incompatibility between EverQuest, AMD processors and Umbra (a technology that, ironically, speeds up framerates). There is a known problem in the Umbra engine that was causing the crashes that some AMD users were originally seeing in Shadowhaven. In our desire to make sure that both Intel and AMD users could enter the game, we introduced another condition that unfortunately slowed down framerates in certain circumstances. We have one person working on nothing but this at the moment and he's made significant progress. We expect this problem to go away soon.</B><p>Well, the team is working on most issues, so that's good. The biggest mystery to me is the whole Umbra thing. This expansion was in development for how many months? Why did Verant not know that Umbra didn't work on AMD chips? It's not like Athlons are rare or anything. Did they really have <B>zero</B> AMD computers in their testing facilities? This was a highly touted feature, and to have it not only fail to work, but to cause crashes and horrible performance, is simply ridiculous. So, when Umbra is fixed for AMD chips, will I see a visible boost in performance? Will I be able to attend raids with the new models turned on? Somehow, I'm skeptical.<p>The sound bug still mystifies me, too. How can there be so many problems with Soundblaster cards? This is the <B>most common sound card in the universe,</B> yet issues remain, and it's a month after release. How? Why?<p>Many of the other things listed are important, though not game-breaking for most people. But what about the things that <B>didn't</B> make Absor's list?<p>Here's our own roll call of things promised, desired, and needed, that either aren't on or quietly fell off Absor's inventory. In no particular order:<p><B>Add Some Animations</B> - When your character sits down, are you a statue? Most are. Call me a freak, but this is actually pretty disruptive to the immersive nature of the game for me.<p><B>Armor Tinting</B> - This was on the &quot;official&quot; list initially, and has dropped off. Where did it go? We want skin to be flesh colored, and have tints only applied to armor, thanks.<p><B>Armor Textures</B> - There still has <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum3/HTML/017300.html">never been</a> an official post (that I've seen, anyway) saying whether Velious armor textures will be available to the new models. Does that mean we're doomed to one plate, one chain, and one leather look per race? Is texture memory completely tied up by what exists now, such that we can never have any other appearance for armor? Granted, the new armors are spiffy, and in many ways look like Velious textures... but we want variety.<p><B>Fix Existing Animations</B> - Many races look funny when they run. Punching looks silly, especially with the off hand. Two-handed attack animations look ridiculous on many races. Swimming animations are mostly goofy... I could go on and on. The models are, for the most part, good--and they look neat breathing. But when they move, it's funnier than watching an old troll scratch his ass.<p><B>The Bazaar</B> - Another promised feature of Luclin that's still on the drawing board. Players are supposed to be able to turn themselves into vendors in this zone, setting prices for their hard-earned l3wtz. When will this happen?<p><B>New User Interface</B> - While not strictly a Luclin feature, there was supposed to be a new user interface released around the time of the expansion. We're looking forward to the final death of the 640x480 screen, more control over chat channels, and whatever else they'd like to throw in.<p>These are some major issues. I'm sure there are more, but my little monkly brain can only hold so much at one time.<p>Mainly, I'm still looking for the gaming experience my computer is capable of delivering. I understand the dynamics of Internet-related issues, and know that EQ will never be as smooth as a single-player game. But I should be able to expect a better experience than I have now--and so should you.<p>One month after Luclin's release, we're still waiting for all the promises to be delivered.
