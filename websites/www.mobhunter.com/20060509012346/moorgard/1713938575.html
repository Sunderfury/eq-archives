This list was originally posted late last week, but has been <a href="http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=8725.topic">reformatted</a> for much easier viewing.<p>Bear in mind, of course, that these skills are still being tested and are very much subject to change. I'll quote Vaslin's disclaimer, just to drive the point home:<p><B>There is no reason to get upset or angry at any changes, modifications, removal, or additions to this list. This is TEST server information. Things WILL be completely different when Luclin comes out. Also, I could have really misinterpreted or screwed up the transferring of the data. Or they could really getting a kick out of pulling our chain. <p>If you have ANY complains, direct them directly to me and not to Verant when the official list comes out.<p>Please note, the grouping of the spells is a whole LOT of speculation.</B><p>That said, it's hard not to get excited over this list. There are some really nice upgrades for players here.<p>The downside? If each training point requires as much experience as it took to get through level 51 (a figure that was kicked around at Orlando FanFaire), these skills will be slow to obtain. Verant obviously doesn't intend for every player to get every skill available... but some of them will try. Expect to see powergamers in places like Chardok and Velk's Lab fighting over exp camps 24/7. Remember the mad rush that a lot of people went through to get to 60 as soon as Kunark came out? Prepare for the same thing, multiplied by about 4.<p>Personally, I wanna be a fast-running, hitpoint-enhanced, super-regenerating, ultra-mending munkee, purifying my body and procing knock-backs with every hit. But since I don't plan to be playing EQ in the year 2037, I might have to devise an upgrade strategy that's a bit more modest.<p>Speaking of Luclin, we got a report from a source close to Verant that the Shadows of Luclin expansion has gone gold, and was sent off to the pressing plant last night.<p>Two weeks from now, folks, we will have it in our hot little hands. Most of us can count the number of days on our fingers and toes. Except for Csenicier, of course, who had that unfortunate accident with an electric can opener a couple years back. But don't worry, he's excited nonetheless.
