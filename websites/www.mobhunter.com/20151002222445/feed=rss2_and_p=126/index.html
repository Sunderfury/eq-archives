		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s in the water...the purifying waters of Lake Minnetonka.  

Seriously, I think folks have this view of Minnesota as some sort of backwoods northern flannel-land, when the truth of the matter is we have a pretty robust Fortune 500 presence.  We&#039;re a bit of a tech/med hub, with quite a few artistic districts in the area.  

To be honest, there are more of us than just the four that showed for this little bit.  If you stretch out past EQ2, and slap a 50 mile radius centered on Minneapolis, I think you&#039;d be amazed at how many of your daily reads come from Twin Cities sources.  I know I was...and I live here.]]></description>
