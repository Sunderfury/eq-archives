		<description><![CDATA[I had mixed feelings about  the final episode of BSG, I thought the first half was really good, but was less than satisfied by the second half.

 A couple of things I was wondering about was what happened to all the other cylon baseships? In the episode where they attacked New Caprica there was at least 18 baseships that showed up on the draedis (how ever you spell it) a few have been destroyed since then, but there still should be at least a dozen out there. Are they just going to give up on finding the humans especially after they destroyed the cylon colony? 

 Plus just abandoning their ships and technology and trying to settle down on earth would not end well. In reality most of them would be dead in less than a year. Baltar said he wanted to start farming, farming with what? If you don&#039;t have the seeds or the equipement how are you going to start growing crops? If they did some how start primative settlements they would have totally altered the time line of advancement in earth. Unless I am wrong the ending said &quot;150,000 years later.&quot; Well farming and permanent settlements happened much more recent than that. 

 I guess had I been satisified with the ending I could have overlooked some of these flaws, but since it didn&#039;t that is all I was thinking about afterward.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That shot was from Crossroads Part II, and like I said, they never establish that the planet they zoom in on was the same planet they discover as the &quot;Earth&quot; (and home of the 13th Colony) in Revelations.  

During Revelations and Sometimes A Great Notion, they NEVER show the planet clearly from orbit, and when they show the Galactica crew landing, they obscure any landmarks with excessive cloud cover.

I&#039;m not the only one to observe this.  From the wiki (http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Revelations):
&quot;Throughout this episode, Earth when seen from orbit is largely obscured by cloud masses and shadows. Unlike the view of the North American continent presented at the end of &quot;Crossroads, Part II&quot;, none of the landmasses in view can be easily identified. ([1]) &quot;

That&#039;s because they aren&#039;t on the same planet zoomed in on at the end of Crossroads.  That planet was the planet (our Earth) they find in the finale.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The final conversation between Baltar and Six concluded the series for me. The message was: given the choice, Man would make the same mistakes all over again. I think that&#039;s how most people feel about their decisions. What happened will happen again.

Oh, Baltar is &quot;God&quot; apparently. Six mentioned &quot;God&quot; and Baltar winked, &quot;You know he doesn&#039;t like that name.&quot; ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;although I thought it was a bit of a stretch that two planets would have the same continental configuration.&lt;/i&gt;

Well, they never really showed the continental configuration on the 13th Colony&#039;s Earth that they found and landed on.  They kind of went out of their way to avoid showing anything that clearly identified it as our planet.  While they did zoom in on &quot;our&quot; Earth at the end of Season 3, they didn&#039;t actually SAY that this was the same planet as the devastated world they found later.  

That&#039;s kind of why I guessed that the season would end up with them finding &quot;our&quot; Earth and that the Earth they discovered wasn&#039;t the real one, because they never showed the continents of the 13th Colony&#039;s Earth clearly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You pretty much summed up my feelings, Moorgard. I wasn&#039;t totally satisfied by the Starbuck &quot;just going away&quot; thing, but the rest were pretty good endings. I was just thinking yesterday though that as much as I loved BSG, it was nowhere near the show Babylon 5 was. I don&#039;t know how many times I&#039;ve wished that Sci Fi would remake that one. Of course, now they are SyFy, so the probably want to disassociate themselves with real science fiction...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to say that for the most part I agree. I felt that most of the story wrap up was fine. The thing that irks me the most is the Starbuck plot. Too much was left up in the air in my eyes. Who was her father? How did he know the song that turns on the final five? How did she know it? How did Hera know it? Finally, the whole &quot;she just went away&quot; was a little silly to me.

I also wish the 150,000 years later part would have been left off. I get the point but really it just didn&#039;t fit well with the show to me. Finding earth and living happily ever after would have been enough.

When it comes to Babylon 5 though I feel the same way. The first four seasons were a sci-fi masterpiece. The last season was alright but they never thought they&#039;d get it. 

I think it would be great if &quot;SyFy&quot; picked that up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The air is certainly thinner for me now.  I&#039;m not a huge broadcast TV viewer, preferring movies or books.  BSG going off the air leaves a huge void.  I was satisfied with the conclusion even when I felt the religious tone was a little heavy handed, like the final scene 150,000 years in the future.  Still I was pleased and relieved that they didn&#039;t botch it all up as some landmark shows have done in the past.  The only thing that really bothered me was all the flashback work.  I felt at times that we should have known these things already.  After a while it felt like what it was, them trying to wrap things up.  Much of that background shouldn&#039;t have played out so late in the game.  Regardless, it&#039;s over and I will miss it very much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I became a huge fan of BSG in the first season and absolutely fell in love with it all throughout season 2. It wasn&#039;t until episode 309: the infamous Boxing episode, when the show began to fall apart and boy did it fall hard.

I won&#039;t delve into all the problems refocusing the show from a conflict between humans and cylons into Jesus-baltar philosophical / religious mumbo jumbo which followed it through to the very end. Instead I&#039;ll focus on the show&#039;s worst decision: the final five.

Most of my favorite moments in seasons 1 - 3 were shattered like glass when they reveal the final five. So many powerful moments become little bits of tissue paper when you say to yourself things like &quot;Tigh killed his wife but Tigh was a cylon and so was his wife and she came back to life so its not a big deal&quot; or &quot;Starbuck went back to Caprica to save her sweetheart but she&#039;s an angel with a destiny and he&#039;s a cylon so it was destined to happen&quot; or &quot;Tigh went to war against the cylons and lost his eye to them but he&#039;s really a cylon too so its more like in-fighting than war&quot; or &quot;the Chief married Calli and had a baby but the Chief is really a cylon and Calli really slept with Hotdog so who cares? Clearly not the Chief who abandons the baby immediately after finding out&quot;.

It was absolutely clear to me when they revealed the final five that the writers had no idea what to do with the show anymore. They painted themselves into a corner where they had to reveal five more cylons and make it a bigger deal than Boomer. What they came up with was simply a mess.

I&#039;m guessing that some changes happened when the money people started coming in. With budgets slashed, the space battles had to go away and instead they decided to pull a Matrix Reloaded / Revolutions and just fill our heads with mumbo-jumbo in a hope that we&#039;ll buy into it because it sounds smarter than us. Well, it didn&#039;t.

The end of the series didn&#039;t help. We have Baltar waxing religious nonsense to Cavel whose holding a gun to Hera&#039;s head in a last attempt at drama. And then the Baltar / Caprica Six scenes: all I could think about was how she snapped a baby&#039;s neck just to see what would happen and didn&#039;t care because the nukes were coming anyway. How are we supposed to forget about that?

Even the opera scene, the Big Reveal, was a let down. So the whole Opera scene was really about Baltar and Six and Roslyn chasing Hera through the ship? Doesn&#039;t sound that big a deal to me.

Oh yeah, and then the whole &quot;we should give up science. Science is bad. Let&#039;s go die of dyssentary and small pox instead.&quot; What sort of message is that?

One of the only redeeming parts is the idea that &quot;god&quot; might be some super-cylon computer that is able to project &quot;angels&quot; in order to shove humanity along once in a while.

I really loved this show and I really wanted to love it but it became very clear to me after the boxing episode that it was in a downward spiral from which it could never and did never pull out.]]></description>
