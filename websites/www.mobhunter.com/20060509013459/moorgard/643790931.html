<html><head><title>Unwelcome Houseguests</title></head><body><h1>Unwelcome Houseguests</h1><p>by Moorgard on 2003-04-30</p>Sometime within the last day or so, the <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/scheduled_downtime.jsp">Scheduled Downtime</a> page was updated to tell us:<p><B>All EverQuest Servers will come down for scheduled maintenance on Wednesday, April 30th at 2 AM PDT(9AM GMT). The estimated downtime is 8 hours.</B><p>At first it said 6 hours, but who's counting? Anyway, that was supposed to be a maintenance downtime--not a patch. But wouldn't you know it, the SOE posse snuck something in the back door:<p><B>April 29, 2003  2:00 am<br>------------------------------<p>We've taken the opportunity while the servers are unavailable for maintenance to update a couple of things.<p>- Increased the difficulty of the mini-bosses in the Planes of Fire and Water to bring them in line with the reward they give.<p>- Added a 12% backstab modifier to the Reinforced Mephit Talon and the Gold Runed Mithril Knife.</B><p>Well hooray for rogues, who apparently weren't doing enough damage with 16/19 daggers or something. And we'll just let the incorrect date on the patch message slide this time, because such mistakes are hardly worth comment.<p>If the <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/newspells.html?source=Test&amp;date=2003-04-29%2023:22:36">modifications to mob AEs</a> that turned up on Lucy end up being the only changes to Fire and Water boss mobs, then players shouldn't be affected all that much. Unless your guild is utterly dependent upon bards for resists--or is too fragile to withstand some of the AEs--it shouldn't make that much of a difference to anyone in the elemental planes.<p>The question is, why now? The elemental planes have been farmed for months by high-end guilds across all servers. Suddenly they need to be made harder? Why? Was some magic number of elemental armor pieces reached, and the database kicked out a warning message for the EQ team that a nerf was required?<p>I can hear the charges of &quot;uberguild whining&quot; already--but really, I'm not complaining. I'm just honestly puzzled by changes like this, and what causes them to be made at a certain time. As I stated above, none of the upgraded AEs will present any kind of a problem for a guild capable of killing the mini-bosses in Fire or Water. Admittedly, wiping out most of the named that drop elemental armor molds isn't all that difficult once you figure out a strategy--but after all, it works that way for every mob in the game. And some would argue that farming elemental armor <I>should</I> be sorta easy, since it's really a kind of reward for making it that far in the game and is basically required for fighting any of the real bosses of those zones.<p>Anyway, as long as the mobs weren't upgraded in some other unnecessary way, there shouldn't be many protests about this one. Just befuddlement.<p>But puzzling game changes aren't what I most want to talk about today. More on my mind is a rather disturbing trend in the way downtimes are announced, both on the EQ Live site and in game.<p>See, it used to be that we'd get about a week's notice before a major patch. Lately, we've had 24-48 hours at most. Guilds like to plan schedules around when patches occur, and frankly such short notice is irritating to people at all levels of the game.<p>Perhaps even more disturbing is the way downtimes are being handled in game. It used to be that if you were online in the last hours before a scheduled downtime, you'd be spammed by a serverwide GM message about an hour before the servers went down, and then regularly thereafter. Lately, <a href="http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm1.showMessage?topicID=38884.topic">players get no warning at all</a>, except for the general message of the day announcement that they don't always see.<p>This is a customer service issue that needs to be addressed. Yes, I always thought GMs overdid it a bit on the server-coming-down messages, but it's far better to have too many than none at all. Players should at least get them an hour before downtimes, then at 15-minute intervals before the servers go to sleep. And for pity's sake, a 5-minute warning is a necessity.<p>Whether it was a policy change or the result of someone getting lazy, this problem needs to be corrected. It's simply a matter of courtesy to the customer.<p>Unless, of course, you like it when people show up unannounced and polish off your Fritos.
