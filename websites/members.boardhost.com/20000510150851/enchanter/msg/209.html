I had not paid attention to what the Gypsy in Rath said when I got her to Enchant the stone. There was a player waiting to kill her so I rushed through it. You have to take the stone to the guy who sells animation spells in High Keep. Talon is the name I think. Give him the stone and 50gp and he will finish enchanting the stone for you. Oh well. Hate when its my fault. The originator of the quest says that all you have to do is the one Enchantment so I had thought I was done. Learned a leason the hard way. (Allways read what the NPC says.)<br>Thanks for your help guys. Good luck. Its a really nice rod. :)<p>--Previous Message--<br>: I just failed the Rod of Insidious <br>: Glamour quest.
