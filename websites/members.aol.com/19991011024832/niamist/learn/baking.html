A wee halfling lady stands atop an overturned vegetable crate, lecturing
to a small cooking class. She wields a large wooden meat tenderizer as if
it was a weapon, occasionally waving it at a student for emphasis.
<P>
<P>
"So, ye want tae be cooks, lads and lasses? &nbsp;Cooks are the unsung heroes
of any great war, as without food and drink, those brawny warriors cannae
keep up their fighting strength." She smiles impishly up at a large barbarian
warrior as she says this, her brown eyes glinting with merriment.
<P>
<P>
"What do ye need to bake? &nbsp;For the simplest of recipes, nothing more
than body parts off a couple critters that are found in many low-level hunting
areas ... and an oven. (Most every city has one or two ovens, if not more.)
&nbsp;For more complex things, you'll actually need to buy some added
ingredients, invest in some cookbooks, and mayhaps some cooking pans."
<P>
<P>
"I warn ye now, lads and lasses, that cooking is nae a&nbsp;fast road to
riches." She waggles the meat tenderizer at a daydreaming student. "Rather,
your rewards come in more intangible ways. &nbsp;Ye can feed yourselves,
your family, and your friends off items that, without your expert touch,
would be totally inedible. Ye can also add some extra flair to events such
as weddings and the like with some sweet treat they'd be unable tae find
in any shop ... and guarantee it's freshness as well. Most importantly, ye
can rescue folks from the dire tedium of eating rations day in and day out."
She shudders expressively at this last.
<P>
<P>
"Until I can be certain if certain foods are better for ye, and therefore
last longer, than other foods, I cannae give ye proper recommendations on
marketing. &nbsp;Such wonders as 'edible goo' sell for less to a normal
&nbsp;(NPC) merchant than that same merchant would pay for the individual
components. &nbsp;Other foods, such as 'fish rolls', can be sold to that
merchant for more than ye'd pay for a normal food ration, and as such, ye
can make a small profit. I've nae found the rhyme nor reason tae it ... yet."
<P>
<P>
"Now, ye bought yourself a cookbook, did ye lass?" Niami peers quizzically
at a young elf holding a large cookbook in her arms. "I hope ye study that
well and take careful notes on it. &nbsp;Once ye've scribed the recipes contained
in it (4 recipes - 8 pages - per book, at the current time), ye no longer
need the book. &nbsp;Ye can locker it, sell it back, or whatever ye wish
with it."
<P>
<P>
"Mind ye, there are a LOT of recipe books available, and ye'll rapidly eat
away at your savings ... no pun intended ... if ye buy all the books yuirself.
Find a couple other would-be cooks and share the expense of the books, and
the recipes! &nbsp;But if ye're not one of those large folks (ogres, trolls)
who eat other (player) races for dinner, then stay away from any recipe books
written by that 'Ghumin' feller."&nbsp;Niami mutters something nearly inaudible
and incomprehensible about programmers and Hot &amp; Spicy Toelings and then
continues the lesson.
<P>
<P>
"The main things to remember with the recipes are the ingredients and the
cooking implements needed. When in doubt, use an oven, but if it says to
do it over a roasting spit, mayhaps ye'll hae better luck than I at finding
one."
<P>
<P>
"Ye <B>do</B> know how tae use an oven, don't ye?" &nbsp;One timid student
shakes their head and blushes.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good grief, were ye orphaned at
birth?" &nbsp;At the small affirmative nod, the tiny halfling turns on the
motherly charm. "Ye poor lad, I be sorry. Forgive me runaway tongue. &nbsp;Ye'll
see brick ovens, with windows in the front door of them and flames dancing
inside of them hiding in odd spots in town. But for the untrained, it is
sometimes hard tae tell an oven from a kiln . &nbsp;When in doubt, open it
(stand in front of it and left click on the flames) and inhale. Ye'll be
able toaetell verra quickly if it be used for baking food, clay or metals.
&nbsp;Then ye just put the proper ingredients inside, pray tae your favorite
deity, and bake. (press that 'combine' button.)"
<P>
<P>
"Oh, and make sure that when they ask for a flask of water that ye use an
actual flask of water, not one of those magical globes of water."
<P>
<P>
"That's all for this class, but feel free tae contact me if ye need extra
tutoring."
<P>
<P>
She notes one student lagging behind. &nbsp;"What, ye want me tae give ye
all the recipes, too? &nbsp;Pshaw, lad, any good cook can tell ye that
experimentation is necessary. &nbsp;But I'll take pity on ye this much --
yuir early attempts should be something simple. &nbsp;Why don't ye try combining
a fire beetle eye and a rat ear in that oven of yuirs and see what comes
of it?"

Ah, my first and favorite love! Take all the known books (which I have had
the good fortune to read myself) and set out a stack of ALL the variations
by type of food; therein you will find wisdom from which to experiment! I
truly look forward to the day when I can obtain jars for pickles, and when
skewers won't cost me an arm and a leg! If I understand the recipes correctly,
I won't need an oven for pickles, which will make my skills <I>quite
</I>portable! I fear that I have yet to find the elusive recipes for rat-ear
crunchies, or "deadly medley". While I've experimented much with the former,
I'm quite hesitant to do so with the latter... One little piece of speculation
worth noting-- while some foods seems to subsist folks much longer than others
(Batwing crunchies last about as long as snake eggs; whereas mammoth steaks
will keep one going for QUITE a while), it is said that things may change
in the future such that the price of foods will more accurately reflect its
value in weight AND sustinence. Word to the wise; if this is true, as it
would make our skill just that more in demand! That, and I hear the "duration"
values might be tweaked, though that's just a rumor. I have compiled a vast
body of work detailing my experience in the best ways to train new aspiring
cooks. Once I have taught a few people in my guild, and thoroughly tested
it, I may make this work available to you. In the far future. Maybe.
