<P> <I><B>Zone analysis: </B>this is one of the through-routes to get from Freeport 
  to Qeynos and/or from Rivervale to the rest of the world. &nbsp;Most found merchants 
  are along/near the road, and as long as you stick to the path, you should be 
  safe shopping -- not that there is a lot here, but one never knows ...</I>
