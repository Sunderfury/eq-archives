  Oggok Trade Supplies

(See companion area <A HREF="feerrott.html">Feerrott</A> for items available
in the next zone.)

<I><B>City Evalaution: </B>Baking and Fishing are the only two skills that
can be performed with travel only between Oggok and Feerott. &nbsp;However,
travel to the neighboring city of Grobb allows you to also try out Brewing,
Jewelcraft and Tailoring. Fletching is not a recommended skill for any of
the evil races unless all you want to make is bows, as arrow-making supplies
are only found in areas where you will be KOS. &nbsp;Pottery will require
travel to multiple zones (Grobb has clay, but you need to go to Neriak for
firing sheets, and to Oasis for sketches). Not enough is known about the
shaman alchemy skill to know if more items are needed than what is included
here. Note that neighbor zone Feerrott has one of the best collections of
items for bowmaking that I've seen outside of Surefall Glade.</I>
