<I>(At the time of this writing, the patch containing poison for the rogues
is only two days old, but we've managed to get at least some basic news on
it ...)</I>

In order to make poison you need a mortar/pestle, a poison sac, suspension,
and a vial. Different sacs create different poison. Vials are not sold, and
only pottery experts can make. This aspect doesn't seem to be fully implemented
yet, and I will update you when I can, as well as the different poisons that
can be made.

The the book, mortar/pestle, and suspension are found in West Karanas on
a vendor called Gindlin Toxfodder. I have also hear of a dwarf vendor on
the island in Dagnor's Cauldron, but have not confirmed this.
