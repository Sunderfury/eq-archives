  East Commonlands Trade Supplies
</H3>

(also see

list, which is the next zone over)
<P>
<B>WARNING: </B>if you have never been in East Commonlands, read this carefully.
&nbsp;East Commonlands is a relatively low-level hunting area. However, there
are high-level griffins that fly through the area, preying on the unwary.
Additionally, while the shops are totally enclosed (walls, ceiling, doors),
critters often phase through the walls to attack you. Do not assume that
because you are in a shop, you are safe. I died several times while checking
out all these merchants, from critters coming through the walls, and griffins
through the ceiling.
<P>
<P>
Be aware that the merchants in this zone love to go walkabout, so if the
person isn't in the spot listed, they may be dancing on the roof, or otherwise
unavailable.
