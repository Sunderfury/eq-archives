The elder shaman (level 25 or above) has the ability, if he/she cares to
exercise it, to make many magical potions. While the skill is still new to
the lands, and hence prone to various quirks and such, there is high hope
for it. Each potion requires that the shaman mix two or more items in a medicine
bag. A legendary shaman by the name of Jonas has had 5 volumes of his Letters
published in certain spots, that outlines the ingredients needed for each
potion. These letters are generally available in the same cities as carry
the medicine bag and some of the needed herbs. Many of the components needed
for this skill, however, must be scavenged from creatures in the wilds.
