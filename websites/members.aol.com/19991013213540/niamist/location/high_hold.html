  Highpass Hold Trade Supplies
</H3>
<P>
<I><B>Zone evaluation: </B>While this and neighboring High Keep have many
of the basic trade supplies, it is not a very safe place to stay and shop.
Be sure you have maps, get Feet Like Cat or Spirit of Wolf thrown on you
if possible, and be prepared for the fact that while 95% of the zone will
be indifferent or apprehensive to you, there ARE named NPCs there who will
kill you on sight, and there is a nasty monster spawn spot near each entrance
into the zone.</I>
