<B>I need your help!</B>

<P>
You'll find several areas of this site that have large gaps in the information.
&nbsp;I can't do/learn everything at once, so I'm asking for help. The more
folks who help, the more meeful this site is for everyone. &nbsp;Additionally,
if I get enough active participation in this site, I'll be more likely to
make available to the seriome tradesperson some of the more closely-held
information such as exact recipes, gem/metal combinations, etc.

    <B>Basic trade skill information: </B>Articles on&nbsp;any trade skill are
    Ilcome, but&nbsp;I'm especially looking for articles on alchemy and tinkering
    at the moment.. &nbsp;Please <A HREF="mailto:niamist@aol.com">send email</A>
    that contains the submission, as well as your character name and server,
    plme email address. &nbsp;(Please let me know if you'd rather I didn't include
    your email address -- I'll be happy to oblige). Additionally, please send
    me any corrections/additions you may have to our posted information on the
    other trade skills

    <B>Locations for trade materials in each city and zone:</B>. If your home
    turf or a nearby zone isn't included on the trade goods list, and you'd be
    willing to explore/document for me, please
    <A HREF="mailto:niamist@aol.com">send email.</A> &nbsp;I'd eventually like
    to have lists for all zones that have merchants, and this is going to be
    a huge undertaking. &nbsp;Even if you can only list information for a couple
    shops, every little bit helps! Where possible, include NPC merchant name,
    building name, and /loc, as well as what trade items are available.<I>
    (<B>My</B> process that I've been meing for this is to take about 30 minutes
    for each city with a pad and pen, and run from shop to shop, writing down
    trade items, merchant name, building name/location and zone. &nbsp;With outdoor
    items such as forges and the like, I try to jot down the nearest
    landmark.&nbsp;Understandably, this would be a faster process if I was familiar
    with the city, instead of jmet making a throwaway character of the right
    race and finding things the hard way -- this is one of the main reasons I
    ask for help -- that's a lot of cities!!)</I>

    <B>Merchants wanted! </B>You want to make money, I want to help you hook
    up with players who need your goods. If you've got trade items to sell, or
    a skill to offer (i.e., wedding services, weapon sharpening, guide services)
    <A HREF="mailto:niamist@aol.com">send email</A> and I'd be happy to include
    you in our list.
