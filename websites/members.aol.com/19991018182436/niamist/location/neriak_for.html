  Neriak Trade &nbsp;Supplies
</H3>
<P>
<I><B>City Evaluation: </B>&nbsp;For the evil races, this is a passable spot,
tradeskill-wise. Baking, brewing, fishing, jewelcraft and tailoring all look
good. (Though for advanced tailoring, you will need to travel for a large
sewing kit.) Pottery will require some travel to the Oasis of Marr for sketches
(or a friend to get them for you from Freeport). Smithing looks good, though
there doesn't seem to be easy access to skewer and other baking molds.</I>
