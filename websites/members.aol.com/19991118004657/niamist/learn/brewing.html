  The Benefits Brewing by Aesop (Tunare Server)
</H3>
<P>

The one book on brewing is an <I>excellent </I>guide for learning the skill
to near mastery levels. Unlike most skills, this one was one I didn't even
bother to put <B>one</B> point into (not even to "prime" the skill!). The
same it true for alcohol tolerance, but it would seem the this skill isn't
as useful as I thought it might be for a magician-- a few drinks and I've
got the intelligence of an ape (and a dumb one at that)! However, I recognize
that there are a few <B>very</B> potent elixirs one can mix for warriors
(who have little use for intelligence in the heat of battle!) who can benefit
<B>much</B> from the bonuses alcohol can give to them at high tolerance levels!
<P>
There is at least one recipe I know of for a brew that cannot be found in
any tavern in Norrath (to the best of my knowledge!), and I know more will
be found eventually. To date, it is not a very profitable skill to have,
as the common brews one begins with can be had for <B>far</B> cheaper than
they cost to make. This may change at a future date, and perhaps the
harder-to-find or otherwise unfindable brews will make it a more profitable
undertaking.

You're going to need to locate several things, before you try brewing. First,
you need recipes. The only thing found so far is the "Brewer's Limericks"
book. The only location found so far for this is Kaladim. &nbsp;Then, you
need a brew barrel. These can be found in pretty much every town. They are
that odd things that look like a barrel with a hose leading from it to a
white trashcan. &nbsp;Then you need containers for the finished product.
Casks, bottles and the like can usually be found in inns and taverns. But
wait, there's more. That's right - ingredients. I've seen hops, malt, rice,
yeast, etc. in Freeport, but nowhere else so far.

Ok, you've located everything and are ready to try. Wade through those Brewer's
Limericks, try to translate them into the ingredients needed, pop them into
the brew barrel, and press combine. &nbsp;Of course, you'll soon find that,
like other trade skills, it's good to train this one up to at least 10 before
you waste too many ingredients.
