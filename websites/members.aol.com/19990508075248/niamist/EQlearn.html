The articles on this page are meant as a <I>very</I> basic introduction to
various trade skills in Norrath. Since Norrath is a dynamic world, things
can change with time, so experimentation is encouraged.. &nbsp;For that reason,
we are not readily making available master lists of item combinations to
the casual browser. (Who knows what we might link in some hidden corner,
if we find a lively spirit of experimentation and knowledge contribution
by our readers?) &nbsp;We also plan on putting in more in-depth guides,
eventually, but not until after things settle down and we have more than
2 of us doing all the writing and item mapping.

<P>
If you've never tried a trade skill before, there are a few things you should
know.
<UL>
  <LI>
    While it is true that all skills in EQ increase with practice, trade skills
    cost you money (in supplies), regardless of success or failure. &nbsp;It's
    in your best interest to :a) have some extra money stockpiled to replace
    the trade supplies you destroy in practice, and, b) throw as many of your
    training points as feasible into the trade skill before you start practicing
    the skill. The only exception to the second suggestion is fishing, which
    has comparitively small costs associated with it.
  <LI>
    Before you even train in a trade skill, you should
    <A HREF="master_list.html">check to be sure that the materials you will need
    to practice your skill are available nearby</A>. &nbsp;If they are not easily
    available, you have to make a hard decision -- do you want to try the skill
    anyway (and make the sometimes dangerous trek to other cities for your materials)
    or do you want to try another trade skill. &nbsp;For example, some smithing
    /fletching/pottery materials are not currently in all cities, and I've yet
    to find any seasonings, spices and some other baking ingredients in Halas.
  <LI>
    My personal recommendation is to have your trade skill ability in the 10-20
    range before you try to make anything. &nbsp;The more expensive the materials
    are, the more ability you'll want to have before you actually try it. &nbsp;(If
    you have limitless in-game wealth, then try it sooner ... and let us all
    know your secret to wealth!)
  <LI>
    Keep close eye on the failure&nbsp;messages that you get when you attempt
    to combine items. &nbsp;<I>"Those items do not combine in those quantities
    ..." </I>means just that. Those items don't work together, or not in the
    ratio you're trying. Give up with those items, or try different amounts of
    them <I>"You lack the skill to ..."</I> means you've actually got the right
    items, in the right quantities, but that you failed to make anything. Try,
    try again. Practice makes perfect, as we well know. And if you're getting
    a failure rate that will rapidly bankrupt you, then don't try the skill again
    until you spend more training points on it, or you've accumulated significant
    wealth.
  <LI>
    For everything but fishing, sell your goods to other players as opposed to
    NPC merchants where possible. If you sell to NPCs, you rarely will be paid
    what the raw materials cost you, much less the value of the item. For example,
    you'd get slightly over 1 gold for a piece of patchwork armor, when sold
    to an NPC merchant. The going rate when selling directly to players is anywhere
    from 2-4 gold depending on supply/demand and individual whimsy.

<P>
A wee halfling lady stands atop an overturned vegetable crate, lecturing
to a small cooking class. She weilds a wooden meat tenderizer as if it was
a weapon, occasionally waving it at a student for emphasis.
<P>
<P>
"So, ye want tae be cooks, lads and lasses? &nbsp;Cooks are the unsung heroes
of any great war, as without food and drink, those brawny warriors cannae
keep up their fighting strength." She smiles impishly up at a large barbarian
warrior as she says this, her brown eyes glinting with merriment.
<P>
<P>
"What do ye need to bake? &nbsp;For the simplest of recipes, nothing more
than body parts off a couple critters that are found in many low-level hunting
areas and an oven. (Every city has at least one or two ovens, if not more.)
&nbsp;For more complex things, you'll actually need to buy some added
ingredients, invest in some cookbooks, and mayhaps some cooking pans."
<P>
<P>
"I warn ye now, lads and lasses, that cooking is not fast road to riches."
She waggles the meat tenderizer at a daydreaming student. "Rather, your rewards
come in more intangible ways. &nbsp;Ye can feed yourselves, your family,
and your friends off items that, without your expert touch, would be totally
inedible. Ye can also add some extra flair to events such as weddings and
the like with some sweet treat they'd be unable tae find in any shop ...
and guarantee it's freshness as well. Most importantly, ye can rescue folks
from the dire tedium of eating rations day in and day out." She shudders
expressively at this last.
<P>
<P>
"Until I can be certain if certain foods are better for ye, and therefore
last longer, than other foods, I can't give ye proper recommendations on
marketing. &nbsp;Such wonders as 'edible goo' sell for less to a normal
&nbsp;(NPC) merchant than that same merchant would pay for the individual
components. &nbsp;Other foods, such as 'fish rolls', can be sold to that
merchant for more than ye'd pay for a normal food ration, and as such, ye
can make a small profit. I've nae found the rhyme nor reason to it ... yet."
<P>
<P>
"Now, ye bought yourself a cookbook, did ye lass?" Niami peers quizzically
at a young elf holding a large cookbook in her arms. "I hope ye study that
well and take careful notes on it. &nbsp;Once ye've scribed the recipes contained
in it (4 recipes - 8 pages - per book, at the current time), ye no longer
need the book. &nbsp;Ye can locker it, sell it back, or whatever ye wish
with it."
<P>
<P>
"Mind ye, there are a LOT of recipe books available, and ye'll rapidly eat
away at your savings ... no pun intended ... if ye buy all the books yourself.
Find a couple other would-be cooks and share the expense of the books, and
the recipes! &nbsp;But if ye're not one of those large folks (ogres, trolls)
who eat other (player) races for dinner, then stay away from any recipe books
written by that 'Ghumin' feller."&nbsp;Niami mutters something nearly inaudible
and incomprehensible about programmers and Hot &amp; Spicy Toelings and then
continues the lesson.
<P>
<P>
"The main things to remember with the recipes are the ingredients and the
cooking implements needed. When in doubt, use an oven, but if it says to
do it over a roasting spit, mayhaps ye'd better find one."
<P>
<P>
"Ye do know how tae use an oven, don't ye?" &nbsp;One timid student shakes
their head and blushes.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good grief, were ye orphaned at birth?"
&nbsp;At the small affirmative nod, the tiny halfling turns on the motherly
charm. "Ye poor lad, I be sorry. Forgive my runaway tongue. &nbsp;Ye'll see
brick ovens, with windows in the front of them and flames dancing inside
of them in odd spots in town. But for the untrained, it is sometimes hard
tae tell an oven from a kiln or a forge. &nbsp;When in doubt, open it (stand
in front of it and left click on the flames) and smell. Ye'll be able to
tell verra quickly if it be used for baking food, clay or metals. &nbsp;Then
ye just put the proper ingredients inside, pray tae your favorite deity,
and cook. (press that combine button.)"
<P>
<P>
"Oh, and make sure that when they ask for a flask of water that ye use an
actual flask of water, not one of those magical globes of water."
<P>
<P>
"That's all for this class, but feel free tae contact me if ye need extra
tutoring."
<P>
<P>
She notes one student lagging behind. &nbsp;"What, ye want me tae give ye
all the recipes, too? &nbsp;Pshaw, lad, any good cook can tell ye that
experimentation is necessary. &nbsp;But I'll take pity on ye this much --
your early attempts should be something simple. &nbsp;Why don't you try combining
a fire beetle eye and a rat ear in that oven of yours and see what comes
of it?"

<P>
I'm not sure why anyone would want to make alcohol over something that is
theoretically more useful, such as armor, but to each his or her own. Until
we get a submission from a brewer, here is a bit of what we know, thirdhand.
<P>
<P>
You're going to need to locate several things, before you try brewing. First,
you need recipes. The only thing found so far is the "Brewer's Limericks"
book. The only location found so far for this is Kaladim. &nbsp;Then, you
need a brew barrel. These can be found in pretty much every town. They are
that odd things that look like a barrel with a hose leading from it to a
white trashcan. &nbsp;Then you need containers for the finished product.
Casks, bottles and the like can usually be found in inns and taverns. But
wait, there's more. That's right - ingredients. I've seen hops, malt, rice,
yeast, etc. in Freeport, but nowhere else so far.
<P>
<P>
Ok, you've located everything and are ready to try. Wade through those Brewer's
Limericks, try to translate them into the ingredients needed, pop them into
the brew barrel, and press combine. &nbsp;Of course, you'll soon find that,
like other trade skills, it's good to train this one up to at least 10 before
you waste too many ingredients.

<P>
Fishing is <B>the</B> easiest trade skill to master and the quickest one
to turn a profit. It also has the added benefit of being the only trade skill
you can avoid<B> </B>spending training points on, and still be able to keep
your learning/profit margin in the managable ranges.
<P>
<P>
Fishing can keep you fed. Fishing can earn you coins enough to buy those
spells or supplies you need in order to practice your more difficult/costly
trade skills.
<P>
<P>
I highly recommend that everyone learn how to fish at one point or another,
unless you've found the secret to independent wealth!
<P>
<P>
What do you need in order to fish? A fishing pole, some bait, a couple open
inventory spots in order to transport your booty to the nearest shopkeeper,
and a stream/river/lake or ocean to fish in. &nbsp;The pole will cost you
over 2 gold, and it can/will break on you at some point, so be prepared for
the need to replace it. The bait will cost you a few copper per bait, and
you'll need at least one bait per fish you hope to catch.
<P>
<P>
Make sure when you are trying to fish that your pole is held in your melee
weapon hand, that you're standing at the edge of the water, and facing the
water. &nbsp;Then just cast your line and wait for the fish to bite. &nbsp;Cast.
Wait. Cast. Wait. Eventually, you should catch ... something. &nbsp;Remember
that I mentioned something about "booty"? Yep, that's right. &nbsp;There's
more than just fish available in the water. You can sometimes find fish scales
and other oddities snagged on your hook. &nbsp;Don't throw them away, as
you can sell them to any (NPC) merchant to add to your slowly growing profits.
&nbsp;As you continue to fish, your fishing skill should improve.
<P>
<P>
When I had a couple hours of fishing under my belt, and about 20 ranks in
fishing, I made a profit of over 6 gold in half an hour. It's still a
<I>slow</I> way to make money, but its relaxing and you're unable/unwilling
to hunt, it's a great way to earn some money.
<P>
<P>
When you're done fishing for the day, stow that fishing pole and some bait
(or some extra coins) in the bank. You never know when you're going to end
up with your corpse on one continent, and yourself on another continent with
no gear, and no way to get to your corpse without food and money. Being able
to run to the bank and fish your way into food and coins can make all the
difference in the world.

<P>
<P>
Jewelry making is not for the faint of heart, or the empty of pocket. Rather,
it is a skill that will take a lot of time, training, patience and financial
resources before you can excel in it. However, once you excel in it, you
will find that your wares will command a high price indeed.
<P>
<P>
You might think, at first glance, that jewelry is "just fluff". In many cases
it is. However, this is a role playing environment, and I'd be willing to
bet that mooneyed fellow in the corner would love an engagement ring to present
to his beloved. &nbsp;And what about wedding rings for that big ceremony
if she says yes? &nbsp;And what about a lovely gaudy show of wealth for that
vain elf over there?
<P>
<P>
If that were all there were to it, however, it would not be <I>that</I> popular
a trade skill. Like tailoring, greater skill and better materials allow you
to make more valuable items ... including enchanted jewelry. By enchanted
jewelry, I mean jewelry that will enhance stats when worn. (i.e., +5 mana,
+4 save vs. poison, +4 strength, to name a few.) &nbsp;You must use enchanted
metals to make enchanted jewelry (hire an enchanter if you're not one) and
some of the better grade gems. &nbsp;The lesser gems do not enchant, at least
in the lesser metals.
<P>
<P>
Now that I've got you drooling and mentally counting the riches that could
be yours, let me inject more reality into the picture. There are 4 basic
metals to use in jewelry making: silver, electrum, gold and platinum. These
are listed in order of cost <B>and</B> in order of difficulty. If you have
problems making a simple silver bar and a cheap piece of malachite combine
into a ring, don't even think of trying out electrum or the others. The enchanted
versions of each of those metals is also more difficult to work with than
it's normal counterpart. &nbsp;Cheap gems are also easier to work with than
the really expensive ones.
<P>
<P>
However, with a <B>lot </B>of training in the skill before you start trying
to make anything, and a careful squirreling away of any pretty stones you
find along the way, you should be able to progress well.
<P>
<P>
By the time I had a jewelry skill of 30, I was able to make a (very)&nbsp;few
different electrum pieces, as well as some with enchanted silver. &nbsp;I'd
made some very lovely pieces of jewelry that took my breath away, and whimpered
when I destroyed a gem that cost over a platinum&nbsp;on a failure.
<P>
<P>
How did I do it? &nbsp;Start small, with silver and lesser stones, and work
your way up to more expensive stones before you try the same thing with electrum.
Keep good notes of what combinations of stone and metal bar make what. When
you manage to get some metal bars enchanted by an enchanter, realize that
not all combinations with enchanted metals make enchanted items. &nbsp;Find
other folks working in jewelry and compare notes. &nbsp;You can both save
yourselves some costly experiments if you share your knowledge.
<P>
<P>
<B>The basics: </B>You need a jeweler's kit (sold where the
silver/electrum/gold/platinum metal bars are sold -- it looks like a small
sack), a metal bar (start with silver) and a gemstone (start with malachite,
as the cheapest). Put the single metal bar, and a single stone, in your jeweler's
kit, close your eyes, pray to your chosen deity, and press combine. I'd recommend
training yourself up to 20 ranks in the skill, or as close as you can, before
you start trying anything. Malachite and silver will become trivial at skill
rank 21, at which time you start using another cheap gem, such as lapis or
turquoise for practice.

<H3>
  Of smithing and grime and sweat...
</H3>
<P>
<I>by Janus Xanathis, Necrobane.</I>
<P>
There are books you can read, and other documents to view that can tell you
HOW to use the skill of the hammer and the forge. I am not going to do that
today. What I am going to do is tell you WHAT to make when your body is layered
in sweat and grime, and the smoke of the bellows is against your face. If
you follow this plan, you shall have the skill to create the armor that everyone
wants, in only as long as your gold holds true. For once you start selling
the armor... gold is not something you need to want for again.
<P>
<P>
First off, let me tell you this. To walk on the road to become a master of
this skill requires much time, and a greater amount of gold. Unlike skills
such as baking, or jewelcraft, in which you can start to recoup some of your
gold loss at a lower skill, you cannot do that with the hammer and the forge.
<P>
<P>
How many people do you know of walking around town shouting for skewers,
or metal bits?
<P>
<P>
Exactly.
<P>
<P>
But as I said above, once you get the skill to start creating the banded
armor that sells so well, you will start to gain your gold back, and you
shall get many an order for more.
<P>
<P>
With that said, what is the quickest road to gaining the skill to become
an armor-smith, you ask? Well, I shall tell you.
<P>
<P>
The easiest jump, on the road to creating glorious armor, is to save up your
trainings for four levels. Once you have all twenty trainings, dump them
all into Smithing. Since you won't have the skill to kill the monsters that
have the loot that you can sell for the amount of gold you'll need... until
you are in the low teens... saving up the trainings shouldn't be a problem.
<P>
<P>
But, if for some reason, you need all of your trainings, there are other
ways to get to the twentieth level of skill.
<P>
<P>
Two to be exact.
<P>
<P>
You sharpen the rusty weapons that are taken from the dead hands of monsters
that hold them... or you make the metal bits that are needed for some of
the later items.
<P>
<P>
I don't want to replace the part of the book, but, some basics to know when
you are doing anything with the forge.
<P>
<P>
NEVER stack anything in it. If it calls for multiples of something that stacks,
put them in different slots.
<P>
<P>
Always start in the upper left corner, and go left to right, down a row,
then left to right, etc. The order that the pieces are placed in the forge,
for the hammer to hit them is quite real. If you place them in the wrong
order, it will fail. Period. More gold wasted.
<P>
<P>
The last item you will always be placing in the forge, is a flask of water.
Hunting down madmen in the desert of Ro is a good way to gain the huge amounts
of water that you will need for this skill. Whether you are making metal
bits, or a banded helm... each step of the way has a single flask of water
as the last item to place in the forge.
<P>
<P>
Also, not matter if you succeed, or fail, when you are using the forge ...
All items you place in it will be lost. If you succeeded, you will have the
item you were creating. If you failed, you have nothing, but some more skill
on the road to becoming a hammer master.
<P>
<P>
Once you have been ranked as having a skill of the twentieth level, you will
see the message that making the metal bits, or sharpening the weapons is
beneath you. It's quite uppity to tell you this, but what it means is that
you will gain no more learning from doing these tasks. So, you now switch
over to making a different item....
<P>
<P>
A metal sheet.
<P>
<P>
But can't you buy those, you ask? Why yes, you can, and they are about the
same price, if not lower, to buy then they are to make. So when you are making
the more difficult items that require the sheets to make, simply buy the
sheets, that way you don't have to worry about the random failure in making
them. BUT... they are the easiest thing to make to get you up the ladder
of skill at this point. Making metal sheets will get you to rank fifty in
smithy. Again, you will fail, more then you succeed at first... and you will
make a LOT of sheets by the time you get to fifty. But a good note is that
you can sell them back to the vendors that you are buying the parts that
you need to make them from. You won't get back all of your money... maybe
half... maybe three quarters... but it's still something back.
<P>
<P>
Once you get to the level in which the metal sheets are gaining you no skill...
what should you make next?
<P>
<P>
Banded Armor?
<P>
<P>
Sadly... not yet. You can try... and you will fail... greatly. And you may
be able to make a piece every twenty or thirty tries. But your learning will
not go up that fast, and the money you will loose will be insane.
<P>
<P>
The next item that we go to create is the skewer. This is another item in
which you can sell it back to the vendor and you will make some of your money
back. At this point down the road of the hammer and forge, you are spending
quite a bit of money per item to create. Skewers are not that bad, overall.
Only a gold, or so, for each mold, and then the amount it takes to make the
metal bits you need, and a single water. You don't get nearly that much back
when you sell them, but every little bit helps.
<P>
<P>
How high can making skewers get you? I, myself, don't quite know. As of this
writing, I have been listed as having a skill of eighty in smithy. It has
yet to tell me that skewers are below my skill, but I expect to see the message
any time now. I shall update this document when I find that information out.
<P>
<P>
If you are at eighty... NOW are you going to try to make the banded armor?
<P>
<P>
Aye. You can.
<P>
<P>
I, so far, have been able to make five banded helms, and two banded shirts.
The shirts I did at with my skill of eighty. Two tries per shirt. I know
I was lucky to only have a single failure per item. But it goes to show you
that having the patience to walk the long road will pay off. With the going
rate being about forty plat for a shirt, if not more... You can see that
even with a few failures per item, you will be making your gold back, and
more.
<P>
<P>
Don't just worry about getting to the skill to make banded, and stopping
there. There are rumors around that smiths shall soon have the ability to
start to make plate, or a type of plate armor. I have also heard that you
are going to need a skill up around one hundred and thirty, if not more,
if you want to pull this off.
<P>
<P>
All I can say is... start making your banded wares... and continue to makethem.
<P>
<P>
Also... out of any of the skills... none are as physically rewarding as this
one. Having spent hours over the hot coals, pounding away with your hammer...
and creating an item that will help save someone from those extra slices
and blows... is also a very good feeling to have.
<P>
<P>
Of course, so is feeling the weight of your purse after you just sold off
a full suit to someone.

If you want to make leather-based armor for yourself and others, tailoring
is the skill you need to learn. Your initial finished product is patchwork
leather armor, which is slightly better protection than cloth armor, and
not quite as good as the expensive leather armor you'll find in shops. It
is also the first armor type that will change the physical look of your
character's clothing. As time goes on, you'll hear a lot of /auction's going
on in your mind, of folks selling, or buying, patchwork armor.

While some folks have expressed an interest in learning just to make themselves
some armor, in order to develop enough skill to make yourself armor, you
might as well continue working on the skill enough to pay for all those pelts
and patterns you ruined in the process. &nbsp;&lt;g&gt;

I'm <I>not</I> going to tell you everything there is to know about tailoring,
but here's some basic information to save you a lot of mis-spent money.
&nbsp;Small tailoring kits are for patchwork armor for <I>all </I>size folks.
Don't buy a large kit because you're a barbarian and think you need the large
kit to make large armor. &nbsp;The <I>pelt</I> determines the size of the
armor made. (Wolf for the wee folks, cat for the medium folks, and bear for
the large folks.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruined pelts are for patchwork, which makes
sense, since patchwork is bits and pieces, and you mangled the pelt while
skinning it. Better pelts, plus the large sewing kit mix with &nbsp;patterns
and certain metal objects, to make studded leather and reinforced leather
armor. &nbsp;Of course, these sorts of things are a lot more difficult to
make, take more pelts, and so on, so forget about it for now. &nbsp;Just
focus on the basics -- patchwork. By the time you have mastered that, and
have a tailoring skill of 20 to 25, then you can start asking around to find
someone willing to teach you the tricks to the better leather armors. Until
that time, you'll waste a lot of materials, and frustrate yourself unduly.
