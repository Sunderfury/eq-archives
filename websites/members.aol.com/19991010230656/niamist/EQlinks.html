Here are a few of my favorite EQ links. More sites will be added as I have
more time to explore
<H3>

  General links:
</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    <A HREF="http://www.everquest.com" TARGET="_top">www.everquest.com</A> -
    If you're totally new to EverQuest, you'll want to visit the main Sony site
    for the game for good background information, hardware requirements, etc.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    <A HREF="http://www.eqvault.com/" TARGET="_top">www.eqvault.com </A>- This
    is a great place to see current EQ server status, when you can reach the
    site (they've had some server problems of their own). They're great on posting
    the most recent news about the game, player guides, maps and more. Their
    message board may be slow, but it's quite active, and a good source for
    information.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    <A HREF="http://eq.stratics.com" TARGET="_top">eq.stratics.com</A> - This
    is the best site I've seen yet for depth of coverage on a myriad of topics,
    up-to-date news, and more.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    <A HREF="http://www.missvalley.com/everguide/" TARGET="_top">Everguide</A>
    - a bit of news, some guides, some stories ... this site is quickly growing.
    I can't wait to see what they're like once they're up to full staff!
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    <A HREF="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/" TARGET="_top">EQ'lizer</A> - chock
    full of information on quests, abilities and much, much more. Some would
    call these cheats, so if you want to learn things the hard way, don't visit
    this site.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/3657/eq/" TARGET="_top">EverCrest</A>
    - a semi-daily comic strip that any die-hard EQ'er can empathize with
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    <A HREF="http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~hakata/eq/indexe.html" TARGET="_top">EverQuest
    Map Shop</A> - some <B>amazing</B> maps of the various zones. While the majority
    of the site is Japanese, it is a must visit for anyone looking for good maps.

<UL>
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.voodoostudios.com/eq/" TARGET="_top">Spiritwalkers
    Guild</A> - located on Veeshan and Tunare, we're expecting this to be a great
    guild for roleplayers.
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://kadanit.com/eqmonks/" TARGET="_top">Everquest Monks</A> -
    containing information specific to monks, I hit this site several times a
    week to participate in their message board discussions
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/" TARGET="_top">Everquest
    Enchanters</A> - great information on spell research for enchanters, plus,
    more importanly for those who have been begging me to provide "recipes" for
    jewelry, a listing of jewelry combinations
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.incabrain.com/shaman/" TARGET="_top">The Shaman's
    Crucible</A> - includes a lot of stuff for shamen, including some hot-off-the
    press information on alchemy
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.mythiran.com/" TARGET="_top">EQ Research Study</A> -
    again, a site that provides "recipes" for spell research, among other things.
    They also have some very active message boards for those trying to get niggling
    questions answered, trade words for runes, etc.
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.eqportal.com/Tinkering" TARGET="_new">EQ Trade Skill
    Guide - Tinkering </A>- gnomes, be not dismayed with the tinkering skill.
    This site contains in-depth information on what currently works, and how
    to make it. This is the site that spurred me to put up a tinkering page,
    and start listing out items that I'd ignored before.
  <LI>
    <A HREF="http://www.oggok.com/" TARGET="_top">Oggok - The Ogre City</A> has
    much information of interested to all you misunderstood ogres out there.
