Fishing is <B>the</B> easiest trade skill to master and the quickest one
to turn a profit. It also has the added benefit of being the only trade skill
you can avoid<B> </B>spending training points on, and still be able to keep
your learning/profit margin in the managable ranges.
<P>
<P>
Fishing can keep you fed. Fishing can earn you coins enough to buy those
spells or supplies you need in order to practice your more difficult/costly
trade skills.
<P>
<P>
I highly recommend that everyone learn how to fish at one point or another,
unless you've found the secret to independent wealth!
<P>
<P>
What do you need in order to fish? A fishing pole, some bait, a couple open
inventory spots in order to transport your booty to the nearest shopkeeper,
and a stream/river/lake or ocean to fish in. &nbsp;The pole will cost you
over 2 gold, and it can/will break on you at some point, so be prepared for
the need to replace it. The bait will cost you a few copper per bait, and
you'll need at least one bait per fish you hope to catch.
<P>
<P>
Make sure when you are trying to fish that your pole is held in your melee
weapon hand, that you're standing at the edge of the water, and facing the
water. &nbsp;Then just cast your line and wait for the fish to bite. Cast.
Wait. Cast. Wait. Eventually, you should catch ... something. Remember that
I mentioned something about "booty"? Yep, that's right. There's more than
just fish available in the water. You can sometimes find fish scales and
other oddities snagged on your hook. Don't throw them away, as you can sell
them to any (NPC) merchant to add to your slowly growing profits. As you
continue to fish, your fishing skill should improve.
<P>
<P>
When I had a couple hours of fishing under my belt, and about 20 ranks in
fishing, I made a profit of over 6 gold in half an hour. It's still a
<I>slow</I> way to make money, but its relaxing and you're unable/unwilling
to hunt, it's a great way to earn some money.
<P>
<P>
When you're done fishing for the day, stow that fishing pole and some bait
(or some extra coins) in the bank. You never know when you're going to end
up with your corpse on one continent, and yourself on another continent with
no gear, and no way to get to your corpse without food and money. Being able
to run to the bank and fish your way into food and coins can make all the
difference in the world.
