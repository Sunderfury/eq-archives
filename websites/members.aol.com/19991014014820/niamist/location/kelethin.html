  Kelethin Trade Supplies
</H3>
<P>
<I>(Kelethin does not have its own zone, but sits in the midst of the Greater
Faydark. Your intrepid editor almost met her match here. This city is all
unenclosed platforms of varying height, and after one bad batch of vertigo,
I fell to my death. I've since learned to cope with it, and initial exploration
has finally been completed.)</I>
