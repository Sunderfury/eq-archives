    Bring me a High Quality Bear skin, and 15p. If I succeed, you get the pack,
    I get the plat. Otherwise you keep the plat. 3) If I have any pre-made backpacks
    available I'll sell them for 20p. (The waiting list is already long). 4)

    I've found them on black and brown bears in W karanas, E and W commons, and
    bear mountain buy the western Inn in Rath Mountains. I've never found them
    on Kodiaks or Grizzlys. Contact Rthorn, monk of the Ashen Order.
