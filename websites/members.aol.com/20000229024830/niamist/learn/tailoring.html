If you want to make leather-based armor for yourself and others, tailoring
is the skill you need to learn. Your initial finished product is patchwork
leather armor, which is slightly better protection than cloth armor, and
not quite as good as the expensive leather armor you'll find in shops. It
is also the first major armor type that will change the physical look of
your character's clothing. As time goes on, you'll hear a lot of /auction's
going on in your mind, of folks selling, or buying, patchwork armor.

While some folks have expressed an interest in learning just to make themselves
some armor, in order to develop enough skill to make yourself armor, you
might as well continue working on the skill enough to pay for all those pelts
and patterns you ruined in the process. &nbsp;&lt;g&gt;
<P>
<P>
I'm <I>not</I> going to tell you everything there is to know about tailoring,
but here's some basic information to save you a lot of mis-spent money.
&nbsp;Small tailoring kits are for patchwork armor for <I>all </I>size folks.
Don't buy a large kit because you're a barbarian and think you need the large
kit to make large armor. &nbsp;The <I>pelt</I> determines the size of the
armor made. (Wolf for the wee folks, cat for the medium folks, and bear for
the large folks.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Ruined pelts are for patchwork, which makes
sense, since patchwork is bits and pieces, and you mangled the pelt while
skinning it. Better pelts, plus the large sewing kit mix with &nbsp;patterns
and certain metal objects, to make studded leather and reinforced leather
armor. &nbsp;Of course, these sorts of things are a lot more difficult to
make, take more pelts, and so on, so forget about it for now. Just focus
on the basics -- patchwork. By the time you have mastered that, and have
a tailoring skill of 26, then you can start asking around to find someone
willing to teach you the tricks to the better leather armors. Until that
time, you'll waste a lot of materials, and frustrate yourself unduly.
