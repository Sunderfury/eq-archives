  Halas Trade Supplies
</H3>
<P>
<I><B>City evaluation:</B> Cooking, fishing, pottery and tailoring are great
here, with the caveats listed below. Smithing seriously needs imported goods
from other lands as does fletching, and you can totally forget about becoming
a jeweler without relocating, or taking repeated shopping trips. Many thanks
to Lucian on the Bristlebane server for locating a few "missing" items for
me.</I>
<P>
<I><B>Caveats:</B> Many of the cooking recipes that are "common" recipes
to start with in other lands are simply not feasible in barbarian lands --
there are no bats, rats, fire beetles and the like to give up the needed
pieces/parts for things such as "Edible Goo", "Batwing Crunchies" and "Fish
Rolls." &nbsp;That being said, there are other things you can make, with
a bit of financial output. &nbsp;Tailoring is great, with quite an abundance
of wolf and bear pelts to practice on -- however, since advanced tailoring
needs items made from a smith, and/or higher quality pelts than
are&nbsp;available in the area, it will require some imported goods. </I>
