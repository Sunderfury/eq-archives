Originally, I was just making a web site to make trade skills easier, but
I <B>know</B> there are a lot of us roleplayers scattered across the servers
who are interested in more than just skills.
<P>
<P>
To that end, I'm throwing up this roleplayer's corner . If there is interest,
I'll even put a section in it for you folks to post searches for other rp'ers
who are on the right server, in the right zones. (i.e., Barbarian Shaman
in the frozen north on Veeshan seeks hunting partner in the 5-7 age range.
Must have a vocabulary bigger than just "kill, kill, kill" and "ack, died
again". Interested parties, see Sharanna.) &nbsp;Until I get feedback, however,
it will just include little tidbits that enhance your RP experience. &nbsp;(Feel
free to <A HREF="mailto:niamist@aol.com">send in your own submissions</A>)

This is one my other half just told me about. While I personally dislike
all the folks who peek at my equipment by right clicking on me (I feel like
there's a bunch of peeping toms ogling me), there is some way to add to the
eyefull folks get when they do that to you. Take a good long look at yourself
from an external view (i.e., press the f9 key a time or two, so you can see
yourself on your screen). Right click on yourself, and it should bring up
a picture of you, with a blank area below it. Click on that area and it will
let you type in a character history (or whatever you prefer) that will show
when anyone looks at your equipment.

  Actions: (that make your character move)
</H4>
<P>
Most folks know /cheer and /wave, but have you tried ...
<P>
<B>/cry</B> <I>{no target}</I> - you cry
<P>
<B>/cry</B> <B><I>&lt;target&gt;</I></B> - you cry over
<I>&lt;target&gt;</I> -- try this on a corpse!
<P>
<H4>
  Emotes:
</H4>
<P>
Again, most folks know /hug and /poke, but have you tried ...
<P>
<B>/panic</B> <I>{no target}</I> - you panic
<P>
<B>/panic</B> <I>&lt;target&gt;</I> - you panic at the sight of
<I>&lt;target&gt;</I> - just the thing when you see a sand giant coming over
the crest of the hill

<B>"Hail a sand giant"</B> - By now, if you've done much group hunting, you've
probably hear this one, however, here's some RP justification/explanation
for it. &nbsp;Your group just got done beating on something nasty, and most
of the spellcasters are busy meditating. Something nasty comes over the hill,
and you need to get out a timely warning before it stomps on your party.
&nbsp;You can try, "Guys, look out, there's a ..." followed by the sounds
of one or more party members getting blindsided. There's a faster way to
warn, them, however, to make up for the time that it's slower to type a warning
than it is to physically say it.&nbsp;Target the critter and hit the "h"
key to hail it. &nbsp;Think of this as the RP equivalent of pointing at it
and blurting a warning. Once you've hailed it, <B>then</B> you can give more
accurate information about where it is and who is in danger ... as you yourself
either backpedal out of it's path, or move to defend your group's spellcasters.
For those of you busy meditating with your noses in your spellbooks, if you
hear someone hail a nasty critter, get your nose out of that book and be
ready to move or fight. It might just save your life and the lives of those
with you.
<P>
<P>
<B>Corpse fetching</B> - You died somewhere you should not have been ...
again. And, well, you really would die if you tried to loot your body in
that particular spot. &nbsp;Get yourself, and a couple bodyguards into the
general area where you died. Then <B>carefully</B> edge your way closer to
your body, trying a /corpse every step or two. The moment the command works,
BACK up many steps, and /corpse again. Repeat this process until you've got
your body somewhere that is a little safer. Think of this as the RP equivalent
of grabbing your corpse and dragging it to somewhere you can loot it in safety.
You have to get close to it to "grab" it, and can only drag in tiny spurts
because, well, <I>it</I> has all your gear on it, so is heavier than the
reborn you.

A very good <A HREF="http://eq.stratics.com/group_com.shtml#_top">guide to
group hunting</A> can be found on the eq.stratics site. I highly recommend
it to all who want to make the most of their group hunting experience, and
the various skills of their party members.

All the races, other than human, know at least one language other than Common
Tongue when they start out. &nbsp;You can learn other languages as you go
along, both for the pure fun of it, and for things like spell research later
on.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>
There are two main ways to learn other languages, and you can intermix them.
<P ALIGN=Left>
<OL>
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    As you get older, your trainer can teach you various languages, should you
    wish to spend the training points.
  <LI>
    <P ALIGN=Left>
    You can find a native speaker, listen to them talk the language a while,
    and then practice the language yourself.
</OL>
<P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left>
This second method is a great way for a group to pass 10 or 15 minutes while
they are waiting for someone or something to happen. Make sure you are grouped,
and in close physical proximity to each other. Each member of the party should
go to their speech selection screen and change their language to something
that at least 1 other in the group does not know, or knows to a much lesser
degree than you. Then go to your <B>socials</B> menu and reprogram one of
your buttons to <I>/gsay</I> two or three sentences. Put that socials button
onto one of your hotkeys that is currently unused. Take a deep breath, and
then everyone begin babbling at once, via the hotkeys, in the various languages.
(This is called "spamming") &nbsp;Have one person ready to switch back to
Common at the drop of a hat and spam "HOLD!" until everyone stops if there
is danger approaching. Since the spamming can be pretty intense, I recommend
only sending across 2 or 3 sentences at a time, with at least a 1-second
delay between your spams to the others, more if you want to see what is going
on. You will see a lot of gibberish go across your screen from the languages
you don't know, and as your knowledge of the language increases, you will
recognize more of what is being said. At random times, you will see a message
flash across your screen that says <FONT COLOR="Blue"><B>"Your language skills
have improved."</B></FONT> &nbsp;However, <B>you won't see those improvements
on your skill list until you zone or log off and back on</B>. It's amazing
how quickly you can become very multilingual, with a few good friends from
other races to assist you.
<P ALIGN=Left>
Once you have learned that language, you can also try to increase your skill
by speaking it to another, but it's much slower learning&nbsp;to laboriously
try to pronounce all those foreign words than it is to learn by listening.
