<p class="head2">II) The Age of Growth (May 1999 - December 1999)</p>



<p>

One of the the main goals was mass over might, so the guild started to
recruit. Every little fellow was welcome (except shrunken barbarians
=) ) They recruited and recruited and they really grew quick, perhaps
too quick.  In one week 25 (!) new members, for example, that was hard
to handle. I think it was really hard to build up a strong
basement. All of the Officers did a really good job. Leitbur joined
the Legion as a level 13 member and Blolyp joned too.

<p>

The guild was now known from Erudin to Steamfont Mointains. The guild
helped all small ones and fooled the tall ones. Every tall one got
stunned when the hordes of the little people appeared in the zone and
cried their battlecry. On the 23 of December a little gnomish girl was
born in steamfont. She explored the beautyful steamfont mountains and
went through fantastic adventures.  But enogh of my own story, this
shall gonna be a Legion History, not mine, hehe... so we continue with
Schiro. 

<p>

Schiro was the founder of the Legion of Little Folk. With his officers
(most of them were real life friends) he built a strong basement of
structure and all seem to work well.  Sure there were internal
problems, but every guild probably has the same ones.  ;) Believe me
or not, all people i talked about Schiro told me that they miss him
and that he was helpful, charismatic and funny.  Bumbo, a dwarf,
builded up the (old) Legion Homepage. Yu can still inspect the old
site, we have a link on the News page of the new site. There are many
screenshots and many many faces from the old guild.

<p>

Schiro was the natural born leader and all small ones showed him
respect. His disappearence was quiet a shock for the whole
guild. Ticky joined the Legion when he was leader but Schiro was very
silent the last weeks he was on.  Then he quit and all started to
crumble, the guild moved in the next age... The age of darkness.

<p>

This was his last note on the msg board of the old page:

<p>

"Hail all Legionnaires!! Our numbers are becoming overwhelming and
thats great! My dream is becoming realized! I get messages on a
constant basis from other little folk from around Norrath who want to
enter our ranks. 
<p>

People have heard of us and generally everything they say about us is
positive. Other adventurers comment on how Legion members save their
lives out of the kindness of their hearts or how we are honorable folk
to group with. Keep it up!! I also noticed that more Legionnaires are
grouping together to go places in adventure. That is great also, but
we need to increase this. The Legion isn't about soloing and being a
loner. It's about success through teamwork and cooperation. 

<p>

I don't mean for people to ruin their adventuring experience by being
bogged down in groups they dont want to be in, but we should make an
effort to group with Legion members when we adventure, also if you
happen to have some spare time and your in a area with a legionnaire
who is much lower than you, spend a little of your time giving that
character buffs, maybe casting the Spirit of The Wolf, or maybe some
spare food or money. Every little bit counts.

<p>

Also remember that we are being watched. Other adventurers watch us
and analyze us. When they watch us we want them to see a Legion
grouping together and being cooperative. Also as a side note: The
legion should start to salute (/salute ) when you are in the presence
of myself or another officer. Little things like that will knock the
boots off the tall folk watching.
