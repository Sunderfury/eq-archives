<h3><a name="who">Who is the Legion Of Little Folk?</a></h3>
<p>The legion of little folk is made up of
all us small folks ready to take over Norrath on the Povar server of <a href="http://www.everquest.com">EverQuest</a>.&nbsp; We are a big family and
help each other over anyone else.</p>
<p>We believe that there is power in numbers
and that in numbers we can conquer all... Legion hoooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<h3><a name="role">Is the Legion a roleplaying guild?</a></h3>
Depends on the definition of "roleplaying". :-)<p>
Excessive twinking and powergaming is not part of our guild. But we don't force
everyone to be "in role" all the time, either, using fancy language etc.. We
usually find a solution in the middle of those extremes.
There are times of playing out a role (they are most fun, but also most hard 
to sustain),
and there are times of talking about the game itself or even (seldomly) things in real 
life.

<h3><a name="newbie">Is the Legion a "newbie" guild?</a></h3>
<p>The Legion has many newbies, if you count everybody below level 20 as 
newbie, and it is especially friendly to those members. But it is 
definitively no newbie only guild; almost all members stay in the guild even 
when they reach high levels, and quite a few high level members have joined 
the guild. We currently have at least two members above level 50, quite 
a few in their 40's, and many 30's.

<h3><a name="how">How do I join the Legion of Little Folk?</a></h3>
Ask any member of the guild.

<h3><a name="where">How big is the Legion?</a></h3>
There is a <a href="roster.htm">member list</a> yet; at the bottom you find
the count of all registered members. There may be a selected handful of members
who haven't yet registered themselves. In November 2000, the Legion consisted of 
about 150 registered members, at least 90 of them really active.

<h3><a name="why">Why doesn't anyone answer my tells about joining?</a></h3>
<p>If an officer or member is not answering
your tells one of three things is happening:</p>
<ol>
  <li>He or she is busy fighting</li>
  <li>Afk (away from keyboard)</li>
  <li>Doesn't want to speak with you. This most probably means that you are 
     one of the large people... ;-)</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="what">What is a guild?</a></h3>
<p>A guild is a group of people that band
together with the same goals and interests in mind, kind of a club or
gang.&nbsp;We treat each other like brothers and sisters and do whatever we can
to help the guild.</p>
<font size="-1"><a href="#top"><p>Back to top</a></font>
<hr>
<h3><a name="when">When is the best time to join?</a></h3>
<p>As soon as you feel you are ready to serve
the legion and protect the rights of little people everyere.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We would like to see people wait till
around level 12 to join just to get some adventuring in before joining.</p>

<h3><a name="listall">How do I list all online members of the legion?</a></h3>
<p>Use the following command to list all members of the guild that are currently online:<p>

<pre>

         /who all "legion of little folk"

</pre>
or
<pre>
     
         /who all GUILD

</pre>

Best put it on a hotbutton (click on "Socials", then right click on
one of the small buttons).

<h3><a name="site">Who manages this web site?</a></h3> <p> The Legion
home page was founded by Dameont, one of the former leaders of the
guild, who now plays only occasionally.  It has been vastly extended
and is now being actively maintained by the person behind Filumtil (<a
href="mailto:filumtil@pluto.camelot.de">filumtil@pluto.camelot.de</a>). All
requests concerning the page (especially screenshots and stories)
should be sent by mail. You can also use /tell in the game to talk to
me. But it is NOT enough to post something on the discussion board
since I cannot guarantee that I'll read everything there in time.
<p>
Please give me up to 5 work days until I process your mail.

<h3><a name="imgurl">I want to include my image from the member listing on the message board, what is the URL?</a></h3> 
<p>
It does not work. Images from homepage.com can <i>not</i> be used on ezboard (or any other server except homepage.com). 
You have to find some other server on the web where you can store your image and reference it from there (ask a friend,
often students have free web server access).
