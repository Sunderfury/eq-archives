<p class="head2">V) The Age of the Next Generation (July 2000 - October 2000)</p>

<p>



I am sitting in my room in Ak'anon and trying to write the next
chapter in our guild history for all of the upcoming generations. Dim
candlelight surrounds me as I stare at the wall with a pencil in my
hand. There are all my notes and the pictures that I took in my
journeys and it's hard to bring all the stories together. All the
names of friends I made in the Legion come back in my head.  Well for
the guild the last months were the best time ever.  Friendships moved
closer together and we are really like a big family.

<p>

Well, as you know the guild had several leaders.  The guild was huge
once, crumbled down, grew again and in a few weeks we start our first
Kedge Raid. What a great thing!  After master Xzandar came back from
his exile we were "cured". The ones who joined just for twinking or
power leveling fell away. We did our first Runnyeye Raid and it was a
really great thing.  We stormed the citadel (25 members!) and had a
lot of fun although it was the first time that a few members died
during an event (it happened before but not in that high numbers). Bad
thing too was that we had no high level cleric at this point for
ressurection. A wood elf tried to spam our guild in Misty Thicket
during the event, he killed halfling guards. So myself and the
fearless Eddward (who guarded me) showed him real Little Folk power
and he fled (after a short discussion, he really ran away).

<p>

The Applepies Clan grew again and we have 6 members now. Filastil,
Filumtil, Muppan, Illerion, Ikipu and myself are wearing the surname
Applepie now and we spread fear and terror over all tall and evil
races =:-).

<p>

And I am so happy to see another Clan coming up. The Tangleroots are
close friends to the Applepies. Meethos, Meebork and Gillain are the
members till now.  I see the last weeks that not only low or mid level
players joined, we have many members in the 40s and 50s who joined us
the last months, this gives us more possibilities in questing things
and do really high events like the Hole Event.  Tototot joined, a
longtime friend of mine and one of the best brewers I met (you have to
taste his Ginesh!) and I like his laugh (Har har har). Players come
and goe and we had many new ones who brought many new ideas and
spirit in the guild but we had losses as well. Dameont, an old
Necromancer gnome and former guild leader quitted the guild. He is seen
rarely in Norrath but if you meet him, remember that he was once one
of us and give him a friendly Legion hoooo!  My full respect goes to
Haradmer and Ticky for the Idea of the "Santa Ticky" events on
Saturday.  And to Winzigklein for the ambitions to start our guild
lottery.  We had our first war in this time also against the Dark
Legion. We kicked them through the whole Arena, mass over might. Lets
end this chapter of our history with the walk through Droga.  The
fearless Applepie Filastil showed us around and the raid was a full
success (until he tried to cast a spell and gated the whole high
level group out at the end of the raid, accidently ..eheheh - imagine
the faces of the rest of us when our live savers just ported out).
