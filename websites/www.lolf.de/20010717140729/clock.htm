<p class="foot">This applet is from <a href="http://www.arachnoid.com/lutusp/worldclock.html">http://www.arachnoid.com/lutusp/worldclock.html</a>.</p>

How this is intended to be used:

<p>

1. In case of an emergency, that is, the EQ servers are down, check the <A target="_new" HREF="http://everquest.station.sony.com/everquest_networkstatus.html">official network status</A>. 
You will find an entry from "today" with a time, say "07:10". That entry will read something like "All servers are currently down for scheduled patching. Estimated down time is 7 hours." or something like that.

<p>

2. Now we know that the servers should be up at 07:10 plus 7 hours, that is 14:10, or for those used to am/pm, 02:10 pm. 

<p>

3. Now take a look at the applet. Your own time is highlighted with a blue bar (make sure that it displays the right time). Verant uses the PDT/PST time zone, which is also called "GMT-8". So, by looking
at the applet, in the line with "GMT-8", you see what time it is currently in Verant's building. You can assume that the servers will soon come up when you see something like "14:10" or "02:10pm" in
the line with "GMT-8".
