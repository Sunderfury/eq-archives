<p>

This is a social/gameplay experiment I (<a
href="mailto:filumtil@pluto.camelot.de">filumtil@pluto.camelot.de</a>)
would like to perform. It has not much to do with the Legion per
itself, but I would like to have little folk to perform the experiment
because I like them most. :-)

<p>

<p class="head2">What is it all about?</p>

<p>

A "gang" consists of up to 6 characters that decide to team up and do
everything together. It's more than a group because there are (more or
less) formal rules which are accepted by all members of the gang and
because it is active not only for one game session, but for a much
longer time (weeks, months, most hopefully the whole lifetime of the
characters). It's less than a guild because it consists of at most 6
people (which will probably be in the same guild).

<p>

Think of it as a marriage: it needs more effort from everyone, but gives
an even bigger reward if it works.

<p class="head2">Benefits</p>

The benefits of being in a gang are these (in increasing importance):

<ul>

<li>More social status to the gang as a whole (at least inside a
guild, where the gang is known).

<li>No more tedious searching for group members.

<li>No more dying due to disorganised/random groups, no looting
problems, no "idiots" etc. (definition of "idiot" not given here :-)
).

<li><b>Very</b> strong social bindings to well-known players from
level 1 to 50 (maybe :-) ). This distinguishes gangs from high-level
and all-level guilds where interaction (besides /guildsay) is
restricted to relatively few events (gangs can and will of course take
part in their guild's events).  <li>Hopefully, lots of fun. :-)

</ul>

<p class="head2">Creation</p>

To create a gang, a few people get together and decide that they want
to create one. Then they decide on the rules they want to play by, and
optionally submit everything to <a
href="mailto:filumtil@pluto.camelot.de">filumtil@pluto.camelot.de</a>
for inclusion on the web site (if they want that). To be included on
this web site, a majority of the characters must be of the little
races, and a majority of the "little" members must be in the Legion of
Little Folk.

<p>

Probably the easiest way to create a gang is if all players create new
characters specifically for the gang and keep their older characters
for times when the gang cannot meet (which will be often,
probably). The members would probably solo until level 4 or so, and
then meet in some newbie zone.

<p class="head2">Rules</p>

To get things going, the basic rules could be like this:

<ul>

<li><b>Continuity</b>. Whoever joins a gang should stay in there as
long as possible. Membership in a gang should not be taken lightly;
either you are in or you are out.

<li><b>Same time and place</b>. All gang members are only allowed to
actively gain experience if the whole gang (up to the last member) is
joined in a group and all members are in the same zone. Exceptions are
of course defensive kills. For this to be possible, the gang should
have a standard online time span (i.e., something like 20:00-23:00 in
whatever time zone).

<li><b>Shared wealth</b>. Everything any member gets (gold, equipment,
etc.) is owned by all members in the first place; if the gang receives
a new equipment item, the characters together decide who should have
it, and as long as the character has it equipped, it is his
own. Things that are not in regular use, as well as money, are "gang"
property.  This puts an end to endless loot struggles. Care should be
taken with NO DROP items.

<li><b>Decisions</b>. When something non-trivial has to be decided,
majority counts. I.e., in a 6 member gang, 4 members decide, 5 members
-> 3, 4 members -> 3, 3 -> 2. If no majority can be achieved, either
nothing is decided (if possible), or a random number is rolled. On the
other hand, a gang may decide to elect a leader who decides everything
(he need's to be well-known and accepted, obviously).

</ul>

Each gang is of course free to create their own rules, drop/ignore
them or whatever they like; there is no superior authority here as
long as the majority of the gang is getting its way.

<p class="head2">Problems</p>

Drawbacks/problems and their solutions are:

<ul>

<li><b>Leveling problems</b>. Whoever has more experience gets the
most exp from kills. Furthermore, several class/race combinations need
more experience to level than others. It is up to the gang to decide
how to cure this problem. Some hints: a) choose class/race combos with
similar exp requirements (rarely possible in a well rounded gang), b)
if one is falling behind, let him fight nastier monsters alone for
some time while helping him ungrouped (powerleveling), c) if one is
going ahead, simply let him be idle for a while (he can do other
business for the gang, i.e. replenishing food/water from the next town
etc.). It still can be possible of course that somebody cannot keep
up.

<li><b>Social problems</b>. People may find out that they don't like
or get along with other people in their gang. Unlike in a random
group, where you would simply quit or ignore the other character(s),
try to talk about this. If you cannot get a consensus in this way, one
or more people may have to leave (make a majority decision).  Or the
gang may like to take holidays (i.e., they split up and everyone takes
their own way for a few levels; on a certain level, all join again).

<li><b>Factions</b>. E.g., gnome necromancers and other followers of
Bertoxxulous are KOS in Butcherblock/Kaladim. The gang should avoid
those areas (faction can be improved by killing crushbone orcs in this
example).

<li><b>Advancing</b>. It may seem that characters in a gang don't
advance as fast as other characters. This will be true in terms of
realtime (since the gang will not be able to meet as often as a single
player would play), but since all members are expected to only play
together, players will simply play other characters when the gang
cannot meet. Thus, while in realtime the gang will not advance so
fast, in terms of /played time it will in fact advance faster since
the tedious looking for groups, etc., is no longer a problem.
</ul>

<p class="head2">What now?</p>

If you have interest in joining a gang (either with an existing
character, or with a new one), send me a mail. I will collect them and
put them online if I got a few. If you want to create a new character,
send me the class/race combinations you would play. To try out the
concept, I will create a gang member myself (any "little" race, any
class) or put one of my existing characters into one.
