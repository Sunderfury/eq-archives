<p class="head2">A Warning to Fellow Tinkerers</p>
From Ikipu
</center>

<p>

 When I was a young gnome, I had my toys much like many gnomish
children. Mishmash collections of gears and pulleys and sprockets and
wire with just a little bit of BOOM to 'em.  I am certainly not unique
in this.... I have yet to meet a gnome that didn't at least almost take
off a finger or two playing around with explosives and mechanical toys.
But when I ventured out in the world to pursue my craft, I found that
not to the case with many of the other civilized races.  High elves
didn't know a flywheel from a camshaft and when woodelves watched
firewater in action, they sounded the alarm, thinking the orcs had some
new tricks!

<p>

    Well, I have to admit, the way the tall ones (Hereafter abbreviated
TTO for The Tall Ones) ooohed and aaaahed over even simple little
fireworks rekindled my passion for them.  So I made myself a couple
batches of gnomish fireworks and kept them with me as I travelled.

<p>

   Well, I had been helping out the folk around Freeport by eliminating
some of the orcs that have laid siege to the Commonlands. One particular
night, I had been hunting long into the night, when Inspiration struck.
I suddenly seemed to Understand spells I had been working on. It was as
if I had achieved a new Level of understanding.  This certainly seemed
like the occasion I had been saving the fireworks to celebrate!  In the
time it had taken my hunting party to recover and to learn of my
success, the orcs had repopulated! (Quick-breeding little devils, eh?)
Well, my hunting party asked if I would like to celebrate by snuffing
out a particularly nasty looking Orc shaman.  I replied, "Sure! But
first lets have a little fun with 'em!  FIRE IN THE HOLE!"  Thinking the
orcs would be confused, stupefied, but not particularly threatened by
pyrotechnics, I proceeded to launch a full display of fireworks into the
orcish camp......   only to be greeted by the sight of 5 orcs turning to
see where these streaking balls of light had come from, .... and finding
me. Eeep!

<p>

   There was no prepatory magic, no strategy, no time. We were in a
pitched battle in moments!  Suffice it to say, we survived.  I am here
talking to you, aren't I?  But take heed!  Those toys we played with as
children have grown up right along with us. Treat them with care - you
could loose more than a finger this time!
