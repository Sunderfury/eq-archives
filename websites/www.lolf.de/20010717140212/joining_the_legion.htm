<p class="head1">Joining the Legion</p>

<p class="head2">Requirements</p>

<p>
To join the legion, you must be either a Gnome, a Dwarf or
Halfling. Tell any legion member that you wish to join, and he or she
will locate a guild officer which will contact you. Be patient -
sometimes, no officer is online, or none has time. There also are
certain restrictions on new members, but that will be explained by the
officer. If the officer will bring you in, there will be a small
ceremony, so you should not be in a hurry.
</p>

<p>
<center>
<b>To join, you must first post an application on our <a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/flegionoflittlefolkfrm7">applications forum</a>.</b>

</p>

<p class="head2">Rules</p>

These rules are there because in the past, we had great problems with
these things, and there were a few ugly incidents because of it.

<ul>
  <li>Don't beg in /guildsay. Of course it is OK to ask for help
  getting some item, or ask whether someone by chance has a certain
  item which he doesn't need anymore. <p>

  It is not OK to repeatedly ask for things (items, teleports) when it
  is clear that at the moment nobody is there to help.<p>

  <li>Don't beg in /tell to high level members of the guild. It is OK
  to ask a high level (or any other, of course) member for general
  help or advice, of course, though these questions should better go
  to the /guildsay.<p>

  It is not OK to repeatedly ask for things (items, teleports, camping
  stuff) when the person has expressed that he doesn't have time
  currently. Also, keep in mind that the same person might have gotten
  10 tells in the last 5 minutes for similar things, and even denying
  your wish could be a great burden to him. So just don't ask (do it
  on /guildsay instead); and when you must ask, then ask ONCE, and
  don't repeat the question.<p>

  Don't do "/tell somedruid please teleport me to xxx", but use
  "/guildsay could any nice druid please teleport me to xxx". If no
  one answers, then don't ask again.
</ul>

Furthermore, there are some natural, unspoken rules in our guild that
are not explicitly asked by the officers; any decent fellow should
live by them anyways.

<ul>
  <li>No kill stealing.

  <li>No cheating and dishonest or non-honorful acts (for example, if
  someone gives you a very expensive item by mistake, and immediately
  afterwards tells you that he would like to have it back (and names
  the intended item), then please do so).

  <li>No ebay buying, or selling.

  <li>Guild officers must be obeyed. It very seldom happens that a
  guild officer tells another member what to do, but when it happens,
  please obey.

  <li>No slander of the legion or any other guild whether it be in
  public or guildsay.

  <li>Try to attend guild events and hunts whenever possible.
</ul>

<p class="head2">The Ugly Thing About Rules</p>

There's a problem with rules: if someone breaks them often enough,
someone has to take measures.
<p>
Most times, an officer will contact the rulebreaker and talk to him
about it, most times in quite clear words. If the offendant does not
accept to change his behaviour, he can be removed from the guild by
the officer. Often, officers talk about the offendant person on the
Officer's Lounge before, and it's not like any officer would delight
in kicking other members out.
