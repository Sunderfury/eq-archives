The raid is for level 30+ char only.
The dungeon is inhabited by Goblins at least half of them are caster type Mobs and are lev 29-36 (one mob is 38).
Ths raid is for Fun but we should be able to gain exp too except maybe for the lev45+. Some cool items can be found there too and i hope we will find some of them.
Meeting Point for the Raid is in Frontier Mountain at zone to Overthere.

Yesterday me and the rest of our GUILD were invited to a VOX raid. Since i didnt manage to talk to one of the
                            orgnaizers today again and i heard it is not 100% sure if the raid will be on. I only can give the sugestion that
                            all who are interested are on at least one hour before raid starts and should make sure that they can be in
                            Everfrost in time (at least ten mins before the raid starts).</font>

The Hole Raid<br>
--snip--<br>
<font size="-1">
I was contacted the other night by the leader of Doom Brigade because of several acts of kindness we have
                            bestowed upon his members characters as well as their alts. The end result was an alliance between
                            ourselves and the Doom Brigade. We have been invited to a raid in "The Hole" on Thursday September 14,
                            2000 at 8:00 pm CST. ...

Sol A Raid<br>
--snip--<br>
<font size="-1">
It will happen on Saturday, the 19th day of August at 3:30 PM. We will
meet in the East Commonlands tunnel and proceed through Nek forest and
Lavastorm to Solusek A. All lvl 15 and up are invited to come. If you
are blessed with being a high lvl you can go to Solusek B which is 1
or 2 zones away, depending on which route you take. Every other
Saturday at 3:30PM after that there will be an open call for any guild
members that want to raid again. We will meet again in the EC tunnel
and proceed as usual. ...

This will be a larger event ("large" like in "we have a plan" :-) ). For details, see the discussion. The meeting point is in East Commons (in the tunnel to NRo); the first
part of the event will comence in the
newbie dungeon Blackburrow, while the second part is going to happen in Unrest; we will rely heavily on our guild taxi service for traveling. For details and the exact 
proceedings see the discussion.

<tr><td colspan=2>
We meet the Gnomeless Savages and join their event (invasion of Najena). 
The information about this event is very sparse. The meeting point is probably
the entrance to Najena. It seems like Najena is for levels 16 and up.
To get to Najena, go from East Commons to Nektulous Forest (you are probably KOS to the guards
there), then to Lavastorm, and the entrance to Najena in Lavastorm is at 
-940/-1048 (always keep to the right wall of Lavastorm).

Note on the time zones: for every event, MET (middle european time,
Europe/Berlin in some charts) and PST (pazific time, the same as used by
the EverQuest page) are given. To get from MET to PST, subtract 9
hours, i.e., 11:00 MET is 02:00 PST. <b>If in doubt, the FIRST time given is
always the correct one</b> (I could make an error when calculating the PST
time). All times are given in 24-hour format, i.e. 22:00 instead of
10:00pm, 10:00 instead of 10:00am. For more information and for a
conversion tool, see the <a target="_new"
