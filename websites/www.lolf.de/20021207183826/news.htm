    There have been no updates here in the last months since all dynamic

    <p>
    Our member list is still updated daily, <b>although new members have not 
    been added to it since 5 months</b>, so the list does not reflect reality 
    anymore. <b>New members be sure to register yourself on

In the legion, much has happened since the last news entry. Xzandar, our former leader, has left the guild (and the game), and has been succeeded by Meethos,
long-term officer. There's a new alliance of guilds, the <a href="http://pub70.ezboard.com/bfederationofpovar">Federation of Povar</a>, initiated by Kulina and with the legion spirit at its core. We're also

We have two exciting new maior <a href="upcoming_guild_events.htm">events</a> coming. The first is TOMORROW, it is a dragon raid on Vox. The second
one is next weekend, it's a war against the Dark Legion. The first one will be important to everyone at least level 40, because dragon raids are always important. The
second one will be VERY important to ALL of our guild, because... well, for obvious reasons. Last time we had a war with the Dark Legion, not a single one of us
showed up, which was a bit shameful. This time it must work. So all be sure to be in the Arena on that day (or at least near). The druids and wizards will surely be
teleporting.<br>

On this topic: please only send in screenshots that have at least a little bit of connection with the Legion, for example, you against a huge foe (like the hill giant), or a lot of little folk on a heap, or something like that (if it has nothing of that, please make sure it is interesting and displays things that low level chars up to, say, level 20, would NEVER see on their own). I'm reluctant of putting images up that display "only" nice landscapes or the like, because there is a space limit, and it's called the "<i>Legion</i> photo page" for a reason.<br>
