<p class="head2">VI) The Age of the Other Folk October 2000 - June 2001</p>

<p>



Over one year passed since I wrote the last chapter of our history.
Let me begin to tell you what happend in the last months.
After the Droga raid, wich I call a huge success, we knew that raids on a 
regular basis can be very exciting and thrilling. Droga was our first raid 
which deserves to be mentioned. It had a goal and we succeded at that goal.
One of the greatest shocks after this raid was the first serversplit. 
Friends we knew since ages, Legionaires we loved were torn apart from us. 
Names like Ticky and Garull come into my mind.
As sad as the serversplit was, life went on and new Legionaires joined and 
pushed the guild forward. Traps Trekker and Phrawd brought in many ideas, 
the wishlist was continued and one of the greatest and biggest achievements 
ever in the guilds history.

<p>

Under the leadership of Traps the Legion of Other Folk was founded.
Mainly designed as an alt guild in first place it changed its role and 
opened its doors for all Norrathians. The leadership was passed on to 
Deanne who carried (and carries) the guild on and we all see the result 
as I write these lines. The Legion of Other Folk is a guild of it's own
since these times, but LoOF and LoLF are still strongly coupled.

<p>

Darbee and Korellyn took over the job of the junior Officers and they did 
some low level raids. And who of you remembers our guild 2nd year 
anniversary weekend on the 20/21 of April 2001 where we did a battle 
of the races and suddenly the Dark Legion stormed the Arena!

<p>

Xzandar carried us on with his wisdom and his silent and patient way to 
handle things. Many problems we had to solve but all he did, he did very 
well and professional.

<p>

This posting on our board was quite a shock for the whole guild :

<p>

<i>
Letter of resignation, written 05-29-01<p>
<i>Greetings and Salutation,</i><p>
<i>It is with great sorrow that I write this letter. By now I'm sure that most of you are aware of what has happened but are unclear as to the reasons why. Over the past year, I have endured many heartbreaks due to people leaving for one reason or another. Understand that if many would have stuck with LOLF, we would be doing the things they always wanted to do. This has been a recurring cycle and frustrated me beyond belief. There is only so much heartache one person can withstand before the time to move on arrives. Unfortunately, the time came earlier this evening. Meethos has been selected as your new leader, serve him well. I will still be on from time to time and as always, I will be free to chat. If I have disappointed anyone in my tenure as leader, I sincerely apologize. I wish everyone in the guild nothing but the best and hope to see you all do well. Until then, my thoughts and prayers will be with you all.</i>

<i>May the Dark Forces Guide You</i>
