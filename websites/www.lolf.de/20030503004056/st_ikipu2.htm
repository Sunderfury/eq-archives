This is a reasonable recreation of a conversation that took place
between Ikipu and Kulina Applepie, shortly before I joined the Legion.
Ikipu was hunting in the Lavastorm Mountains...

<p>


<font color="#208080">Ikipu: Hey Kulina, you have a sec?
</font><br><font color="#802080">Kulina: fight!</font>

<p>
............
</p>

<font color="#802080">K: What can I do for you, friend?
</font><br><font color="#208080">I: Well, I just thought you could sympathize ... I just lost another
pet.  This place seems to be awful hard on them.
</font><br><font color="#802080">K: I am sorry to hear that
</font><br><font color="#208080">I: I know I really shouldn't get so attached to them, but I really do.
</font><br><font color="#802080">K: Really? Me too!
</font><br><font color="#208080">I: At least you have more of an excuse ... Your pets at least USED to be
people. Mine are just a bit of magic moving around an axe and shield.
But sometimes ...  &lt;glances around nervously to see if anyone is
watching&gt; ...
</font><br><font color="#802080">K: &lt;whispers&gt; What is it Ikipu?
</font><br><font color="#208080">I: Sometimes I give mine little names .... names like Gaseker and Bobn
</font><br><font color="#802080">K: Hey - I do that too!  But please dont tell anyone... our secret?
</font><br><font color="#208080">I: Our secret.
</font>



<p>

Again, if you are reading this Kulina, I am sorry!  I just have to know
if anyone else out there is as crazy as we are...
