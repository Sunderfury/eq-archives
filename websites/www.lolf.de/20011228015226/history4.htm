One of the main problems were that there were no officers available if
you needed them. So Xzandars first step was to lift up a handful of
legionaires into the officer rank of the guild. New members joined and
the guild started to grow again. Very quick! The new leader spent many
hours to quest items with members of the guild, you all know him and I
stop my hymns of him know (I try...). 

<p>

I remember one night when Xzandar, Wezzin (my father) and I tried to
get my enshroudment robe... we camped for the globe of shadow in Guk
and tried to kill the Nocta Priest for 5 hours. And the globe didnt
drop.  Another gnome joined us and we tried to help each other. I was
so tired I thought I'd fall from my chair. At 4am I gave up.  I had to
work the other day and I told Xzandar that I thought that this globe
will never drop. So we left Guk very depressed and tired. We entered
South Ro and Xzandar told me, that the other gnome looted the globe
one minute ago. In that moment I felt a strange pain in my stomach, in
other words I felt like the an idiot. 10 minutes later! But he was not
angry with me, not one bad word.(funny sidenote: next time we tried
it took around 10 minutes. I sneaked throgh Guk, saw the priest,
gave Xzandar a tell he was bound in Guk, he gated there, killed the
priest and I looted the globe.) Argh! Again such a long story from me
hehe, nevermind, back to the Legion.

<p>


One day i hunted in Mistmoore and i met Ducati Bombati. He was an
Officer of the Gnomeless Savage guild (gnome only) - we sweared
friendship and an alliance between our guilds to combine the efforts
of the small races.  A few weeks later we had our first mass event in
Crushbone together with them. We camped Dvinns Tower and I can
remember in funny memories that someone entered Crushbone and shouted
"someone camping Dvinn ?"  The second shout was "yes, about 50 people"
and then the screen was spammed with our HOOOOO and the Gnomeless
Savages' TAHOO! battlecrys :). We had several Events like the one in
Blackburrow or more Legion only battlegroups in Kunark.

<p>

I often visited Steamfont Mountains to recruit new members, I think it
was a very good time for the guild. Yes, i believed in mass over might
at this time. Friends of mine joined Everquest, Filastil and Filumtil,
and the idea of the Applepie Clan was born. A dark shadow crawled
upon the guild.  When I entered the guild the guild was completly
different. I remeber names like Bertlov, Wezzin,Grimburn, Vivictus and
Kanje, Terondaf, Liara or the powerfull Darkan Doubleblade to name
just a few.

<p>

We had a strong basement of members. All this vanished because we
recruited to many members and a few bored the rest of the guild of
stupid questions about powerleveling and twinking.  To get the strong
basement back that we had once Xzandar made a hard decission. He broke
the first rule "mass over might" and stopped the mass recruitment for
the first time. I think it was a hard but wise thing to do that. We
didnt recruit over one month but I made a good experience in this time.
All the ones that were really interested joined us after the stop
(they waited weeks like me). Ikipu and Binadur for example.

<p>

And Xzandars plan worked out. We came to new power in the guild. A few
left but these are the ones who are not interested in the guild so we
didnt care about them =)

In the month we didnt recruit master Xzandar went to Kunark on
exile. He was there to work mental on new ways to strengthen the guild
and himself. After weeks of meditation and silence he came back with
new power and is now leading us into the next age.
