<p class="head2">I) The Age of the Founders (April 1999)</p>



<p>

The guild was founded by a couple of working colleges and friends in
the US. They started with a great idea of a small races only guild,
the first one on Povar. Founders are: Schiro, Nottall, Wamren, Snaches
and so on...  The first meeting was in Misty Thicket around 2nd
Oktober 99.(The clever ones recognice at this point that it took some
time to get the whole guild together =)) It was an historical moment
for all of the guild. Leader Schiro raised his weapon in the air and
screamed Legion HOOOOOOO and the others joined the battlecry!
(Actually there were all drunk and it was spelled different) and I
wish i was there.

<p>

When i think about that moment the hairs on my neck
stands up and a cold breeze goes thrugh my gnomish body. All of the
guild were very nice and they tried to help each other wherever they
could to get items and stuff. All the old members that i asked about
the old meetings told me, after I asked what they have done at the
events: dont remember... I was drunk. ALL of them hehe! Nottall told
me a story that is so funny about the night the Legion of Little Folk
was founded. A stinky Dark Elf enchanter sneaked into the ranks of the
guild. Schiro saw this to late and tried to bring him out of guild
with the command /guilddelete.  Well well, yes.. ahm... err... it was
the wrong command and the guild was deleted ;). The correct command is
/guildremove, but after one day all were back in then guild and the
rest is history...

<p>

Here is the old charter from the Legion of Little Folk:

<p>

In The Legion of Little Folk, our motto is "Mass over Might."  We
believe that with the combined efforts of Dwarves, Gnomes and
Halflings, we will be able to defeat any adversary.  The Legion
focuses on teamwork and cooperation among little people. The Legion
also believes in fostering an appreciation of Little Folk in
others. Because of this the Legion will often hold a mass meeting,
which will include all members.  We will travel to many dungeons
ranging all over the land of Norrath, and attempt to overcome it with
sheer numbers (mass over might).  Guild members also offer free
services to other members; services such as the crafting of armor or
jewelry, free of charge.
