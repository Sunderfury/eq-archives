<p class="head2">How do I get on the mailing list?</p>

Go to <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/LegionOfLittleFolk">our
eGroups page</a> and go on from there.

<p>

You will *NOT* be automatically added to the mailing list when you submit yourself to the member list, so you do have to do it yourself.

<p>

<p class="head2">Where do I send mails that I want to go to all members?</p>

<a href="mailto:legionoflittlefolk@egroups.com">LegionOfLittleFolk@egroups.com</a>

<p>

<p class="head2">I don't have EMail...</p>

Come on, if you can play EverQuest, you are bound to have an email
address, even if you don't read it regularly.  You need to create an
account on <a href="http://www.egroups.com">eGroups</a> with that
address. Then go to <a
href="http://www.egroups.com/group/LegionOfLittleFolk">our eGroups
page</a> and subscribe yourself to the mailing list. You will get one
mail from the mailing list owner, and you have to reply to that mail
(or something like that).

<p>

Now you can ignore the mails that go to your email address, and just
read the mailing list on their web site. No need to check your mail
every hour.

<p>

<p class="head2">Who is managing the mailing list?</p>

That would be <a href="mailto:LegionOfLittleFolk-owner@egroups.com">Frim</a>.
