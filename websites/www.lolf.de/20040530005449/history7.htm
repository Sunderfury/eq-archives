<p class="head2">VII ) The Age of the Tangleroot June 2001 - August 2001</p>

As you have heard the leadership was passed on to Meethos Tangleroot.

<p>

If you have not heard of him I try to explain what kind of Halfling he was.
Whenever you needed a port, help in a quest he was there for you.
Whenever you been in a sad mood, he cheered ya up.
Meethos was a natural leader, a great person and he had really great goals 
with us. The Legions morale was down, the weight to take over the leadership 
from master Xzandar was unbelievable.

<p>

Meethos had to fight many problems. While old legionaires like Darvan 
returned home, many legionaires left us.
Meethos, as a high level druid, leaded us into a few completly awesome raids 
beyond our imagination at this time. Together with our great 
Templar Kaisersos they lifted us up into the ranks of a small raiding guild.

<p>

Epic Quests had been implemented into the game and a new land, Velious, 
had been discovered. I remember a raid to Velketor with Gotrik (before 
they changed Velketor's Labyrinth to Karnors 2) - it was a VERY thrilling raid.
One step forward and we all would be toasted by a huge AE Trap.
(Gotrik found this out later). He just told us that he has a bad feeling at the moment and that he prefers to port out now. 

<p>

Meethos, as our leader, set us high goals. One of this goald was Kaisersos'
Epic Ragefire Camp.
The whole guild worked together on this, we built shifts and cleared all 
those Fire Giants away. We had all been put under an enormous pressure.
We achieved the goal but we payed a high price for it.
This camp left a deep scar in the guild and splitted us.
It was a time where the guild had not the best time.

<p>

Meethos gaev his best but I felt that he put to much pressure unto his own 
shoulders and lifted us up to a *too* high position, for which the guild 
was not ready yet.

Things had been said that no one wanted to say and people had been hurt and 
emotions went high.

<p>

In this time I moved houses in RL. I thought all had become good again.
Due a mistake I had almost 3 weeks with no phone connection in my new flat.
After 2 weeks my phone rang...

<p>

<pre>
EQPhoneLogfile is now *ON*
Filastil: Hi Kulina, how are you ?
Kulina: i miss you all, but fine.
Filastil: you are guildleader now.

Kulina: NOOOOOOO !
Filastil: Well, have a nice day.. i go and play EQ now .. cu
Kulina: cu ........

<i>
COMING SOON : CHAPTER VIII) The Age of Kulina the Applepie! (08/2001-05/2002)<br>
</i>
>> Kulina leads to new spiritual heights; Gotrik leads to awesome worldly successes (Luclin emerges; raids start in earnest). <p>
<i>
COMING SOON : CHAPTER IX) The golden Age of Gotrik Irongutt! (05/2002-06/2003) <br>
</i>
>> Kulina grows weary of the new world of Norrath and leaves. Gotrik takes over guild leadership in addition to raid leadership; transforms the guild into a expert non-zerg guild of fine top level raiders (PoP and LoY emerge); raids are now constantly done on Wednesday and Sunday, and whenever enough people are on. <p>
<i>
COMING SOON : CHAPTER X) The silent Age without Gotrik Irongutt (07/2003-) <br>
</i>
>> Gotrik leaves for reasons of another world (his last act is leading the first day of our first NTOV; the weekend turns out to be a great success, acknowledged by the finest guilds on the server); many fine people leave to other guilds or to RL; the hardest of the hard core stay (LDoN emerges).
