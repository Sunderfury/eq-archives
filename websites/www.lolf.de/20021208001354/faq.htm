<h3><a name="who">Who is the Legion Of Little Folk?</a></h3>
<p>The Legion of Little Folk is made up of
all us small folks ready to take over Norrath on the Povar server of <a href="http://www.everquest.com">EverQuest</a>.&nbsp; We are a big family and
help each other over anyone else.</p>
<p>We believe that there is power in numbers
and that in numbers we can conquer all... our battle cry is Legion HoooOOoOOoooooooooOOoooo!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<h3><a name="role">Is the Legion a roleplaying guild?</a></h3>
Depends on the definition of "roleplaying"!<p>
We are definitely a "roleplaying" guild in that we have a theme (small people only), if you take the smallest possible definition of "roleplaying".<p>
Excessive twinking and powergaming is not part of our guild. But we don't force
everyone to be "in role" all the time, either, using fancy language etc.. We
usually find a solution in the middle of those extremes.
There are times of playing out a role (they are most fun, but also most hard
to sustain),
and there are times of talking about the game itself or even things in real
life.
<p>
In it's current form, actual "roleplaying" (conclusively impersonating a role) happens seldom; there are 1 or 2 persons who are "in role" always. Roleplayers are NEVER badmouthed for roleplaying on /guildsay, however.

<h3><a name="newbie">Is the Legion a "newbie" guild?</a></h3>
<p>No.
<p>We regularly have legion-only raids in places like Umbral Plains or the Planes. We can easily take out Phiny in Kedge Keep with a single spontaneous group. We can easily break and clear Fear with 2 spontaneous groups - with people from our sister guild Legion of Other Folk, of course! Hard to find a Gnome Monk. 

<p>That said, YES, we are a guild for newbies.

<p>The Legion has quite a few people lower than planes-capable, 
and it is trying to be especially friendly to those members. But it is
definitively no newbie only guild; most members stay in the guild 
when they reach high level. Currently, most of members are above 50, quite
a few in their 40's, and many alts of lower levels (a few mains too). Our sister guild Legion of Other Folk is more spread over the level ranges, too.

<h3><a name="how">How do I join the Legion of Little Folk?</a></h3>
It's explained on the <a href="joining_the_legion.htm">Joining the Legion</a> page.

<h3><a name="where">How big is the Legion?</a></h3>
There is a <a href="roster.htm">member list</a>; at the bottom you find
the count of all registered members. This number is very inaccurate though, we ust GuildMagic these days instead. In March 2002, the Legion consisted of
about 273 registered members, at least 86 of them really active, with an average
level of something about 40.

<h3><a name="epic">What is the Legion's stance on epics?</a></h3>
Epics are a very difficult topic for a guild.<p>
On average, it literally takes months for any person to get his/her epic.<p>
Before you wonder how long YOUR epic will take, keep in mind that the most high-profiled members of our guild took everything from 8 to 12 months for their epics (that includes the guild leader).<p>
Keep in mind that most high level persons (especially those who already have their epic weapons) have fought the same epic fights over and over again, for many of our members. To some, it gets so dull that they start screaming when more people ask them for help. Others are more relaxed and help everyone that asks.<p>
Epics are coming up on the Officer's forum at least 2 or 3 times a month, you can be sure that we don't ignore that topic, and we are aware of the problems they are causing for everyone.
<p>
<b>A small guideline to make YOUR epic easier for you and for the guild:</b>
<ul>
<li>Inform yourself <i>most</i> thoroughly about your epic. Copy down a checklist on a sheet of paper with a pencil, just to become aware of how much work it is.
<li>Try to become aware of the "hot spots" of your epic - the bottlenecks, or the fights which take more than one group.
<li>First, do the easy steps. Do ALL of them.
<li>When looking for help from your guild mates, be <i>patient</i>.
<li>When you are at a point where you cannot do anything by yourself or with one group, then start to get support for your larger fights.
<li>When looking for help from your guild mates, be <i>patient</i>.
<li>If you need a larger fight done, by all means try to lead it yourself. Do all the work of organizing the raids etc. yourself (you don't need to actually <i>lead</i> the more difficult raids yourself if you can find a raid leader, but you <i>should</i> do the organizing). Most importantly, check out our Quest forum, which contains a list of epic fights - you can see the minimum amount of forces required to do them. Try not to get too many more people.
<li>When looking for help from your guild mates, be <i>patient</i>. You <i>will</i> receive help sooner or later.
<li>Keep in mind that our guild leader took 12 months to finish her epic. Our most prominent warrior and top raid leader, who could have rushed everyone to fight his fights took more than 8 months to finish his epic. By <b>no</b> means get other people "rushed" through their epics. <i>Everyone</i> has to wait quite a bit of a time, and when YOU start your epic, most probably there are already 5 other members of your class that are already in the pipeline.
<li>When looking for help from your guild mates, be <i>patient</i>. If you don't get help instantly (or even after a month), this does <i>not</i> mean that you are not wanted. It just means that the capacities of the guild are at a limit.
<li>Some members get a bit angry when people frequently <i>request</i> help for their epics. Most members <i>do</i> notice people that help others and <i>don't</i> request help for themselves. Those people will start to see that other people actually <i>want</i> to help them with their epic.
<li>Help other people with <i>their</i> epics as much as possible.
</ul>

<h3><a name="why">Why doesn't anyone answer my tells about joining?</a></h3>
<p>If an officer or member is not answering
your tells one of three things is happening:</p>
<ol>
  <li>He or she is busy fighting</li>
  <li>Afk (away from keyboard)</li>
  <li>Doesn't want to speak with you. This most probably means that you are
     one of the large people... ;-) try the Legion of Other Folk instead.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="what">What is a guild?</a></h3>
<p>A guild is a group of people that band
together with the same goals and interests in mind, kind of a club or
gang.&nbsp;We treat each other like brothers and sisters and do whatever we can
to help the guild.</p>
<font size="-1"><a href="#top"><p>Back to top</a></font>
<hr>
<h3><a name="when">When is the best time to join?</a></h3>
<p>As soon as you feel you are ready to serve
the legion and protect the rights of little people everyere.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We would like to see people wait till
around level 20 to join just to get some adventuring in before joining, but we accept members starting at level 12.</p>
<font size="-1"><a href="#top"><p>Back to top</a></font>

<h3><a name="listall">How do I list all online members of the legion?</a></h3>
<p>Use the following command to list all members of the guild that are currently online:<p>

<pre>

         /who all "legion of little folk"

</pre>
or
<pre>

         /who all GUILD

</pre>

Best put it on a hotbutton (click on "Socials", then right click on
one of the small buttons).

<h3><a name="site">Who manages this web site?</a></h3> <p> The Legion
home page was founded by the person behind Dameont (Gnome Necromancer), one of
the former leaders of the
guild.  It has been vastly extended
and is now being actively maintained by the person behind Filumtil (Gnome Necromancer,
too, <a
href="mailto:filumtil@pluto.camelot.de">filumtil@pluto.camelot.de</a>) (online as Feppsi, Gnome Enchanter, these days). All
requests concerning the page (especially screenshots and stories)
should be sent by mail. You can also use /tell in the game to talk to
me. But it is NOT enough to post something on the discussion board
since I cannot guarantee that I'll read everything there in time.
<p>
Please give me up to 5 work days until I process your mail, and then remind me of it :-).
<p>
Until November 2001, the person behind Healfix (Gnome Cleric, <a href="mailto:healfix@gmx.net">healfix@gmx.net</a>)
has done the Member List and several other things.
