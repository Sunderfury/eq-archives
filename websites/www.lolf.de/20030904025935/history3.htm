<p class="head2">III) The Age of Darkness (Dezember 1999 - April 2000)</p>

<p>

Schiro disapeard and gave the leadership to Yulonda. Well she was not
a officer but i think the other officers knew what difficult task it
is to be a guild leader. She agreed but she could not stop the many
members leaving the guild. There was no way to stop that and the guild
shrunk to a minimum of players. I think she was very enthusiastic at
the beginning of her carrier but she saw that she was not able to keep
the binds together. She lifted Leitbur up in the officer ranks. Sad
thing she was bugged and Leitbur waited over on month before he could
invite members! She was leader for about 2 months and left the guild
for private reasons, though she is still in the game.  She gave the
leadership to an old gnome who most of you know.

<p>

Dameont gave his best to keep the guild together, but the guild was in
my eyes at a dead point. All the known recruiters left, just a few
stayed in the guild. The homepage lied there, but it was not updated
since Dezember 1999.

<p>

I hope its ok when I change back to my personal story. I tried to
enter the guild for about two weeks, it was just horrible, there where
no recruiters online or too far away - over the whole two weeks! I
often talked to Saberman at this time, he was no officer at this point
and the first thing he told me was something like "what, you want to
enter this guild? i think about quitting". Hehe! Good old Saberman! 

<p>

So joined the Legion of Little Folk in Highpass Hold. Leitbur was the
officer who invited me into the Legion. I will never forget this
moment (I died during the process). A gnome called Xzandar offered me
to be my mentor shortly after I joined the guild, he was the 1st
officer of the Legion.  Five days after I joined the Legion I was on
my first event . The whole active guild, I think we where six members,
met in Kelethin and stormed Crushbone. Dameont joined us there, of
course we had a lot of fun.  Well life went on in the guild, more or
less active, I entered the 20 Lvl.

<p>

Then all changed from one day to the other.  Xzandar told me that he
would be going to be guild leader soon and he wants me to be an
officer in the guild (me? I was stunned!) and I refused, because I
didnt felt able to do handle such a great task, but after another talk
with him, I agreed. Dameont did a really great job in the three months
that he was guild leader to keep the few that stayed in the guild
together. He build up the homepage as we know it for example, but
theres another world in front of the monitor that needed him. The new
leader changed a few general things and so we moved on into the next
age, the age of awakening.
