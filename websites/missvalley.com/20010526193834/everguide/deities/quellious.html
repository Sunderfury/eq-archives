        <P> 
        <P> Followers of Quellious seek peace. They are not strict pacifists though 
          and will fight to defend themselves and those they care about. The peace 
          they seek is an inner one. They wish to know all there is to know about 
          themselves and the world around them. They thirst for knowledge of their 
          true selves and strive to help others attain enlightenment. It is through 
          the sharing of this knowledge that they believe universal peace can 
          be obtained. If every creature fully understood itself and its neighbors 
          there would be no need for conflict and war. Followers of Quellious 
          often follow a nomadic lifestyle, constantly seeking what there is to 
          know and hoping to find themselves along the way.
