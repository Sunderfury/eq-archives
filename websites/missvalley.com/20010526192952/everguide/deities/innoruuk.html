        <P> 
        <P> Followers of Innoruuk include nearly the entire Dark Elven race who 
          regard him as their "Father." They believe that Hate is a creative force, 
          or rather "THE" creative force in the universe. Creativity born of destruction. 
          Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what they 
          want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain it. It is only 
          through the total disdain of your enemies that you can gain true power 
          over them. Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt 
          and viciousness. It is the honest belief of the followers of Innoruuk 
          that if they were to hate strong enough they could destroy all of Norrath.
