        <P> 
        <P> Followers of Bertoxxulous believe the only truth on Norrath is that 
          everything dies. They view the decay of flesh as a thing of ultimate 
          beauty. The subtle purples of a fresh bruise, the almost irridescent 
          yellow green of an infested pustule, are but a few of the things that 
          His followers relish. It is not surprising that many of His followers 
          pursue the dark art of Necromancy, for to them nothing is more desirable 
          than to be surrounded by beings who, even in unlife, continue to rot 
          and decay. Do not take this to mean that His followers are suicidal 
          or seek a quick death. To the contrary, they wish to live long, painful 
          lives, spreading their dark, diseased stain across all of Norrath.
