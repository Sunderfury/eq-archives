        <h1 ALIGN=Center> <b>Pottery </b></h1>
        <P ALIGN=Left> &nbsp; So, you want to be a potter? Many (most) would blow 
          this off, "why would you want to spend 20 practice points on making, 
          uh, pots." But let me ask you this, what use is a swordsmith in a time 
          of peace, or to a shopkeep or farmer? These are the people who benefit 
          from, and benefit, a potter. So rule number one: unless you know of 
          many bakers around in shouting distance, don't try to sell to players. 
          NPC's do just fine. But before rule #1, a potter must go though 4 other 
          rules. (Trust me in the numbering, an experienced potter would understand)<BR>
          &nbsp;Rule #2: Practice Points: First you need some points in this skill. 
          If you have many to spare and a large bank account, then work your way 
          up from one even. If you plan to do something else, bring that to 20 
          first, then spend any extra on pottery. The reasoning is that working 
          pottery up is a lot cheaper than anything else. But if you have 50 point 
          just lying around, sure, go for a 20 in pottery.<BR>
          &nbsp;Rule #3: Seed Money: depending on how much you have to spare, 
          gauge your practice points accordingly. It takes between 5 and 10 pp 
          to start up, depending on your int. and choice of sketches. <BR>
          &nbsp;Rule #4: Materials: find a good source of materials. You will 
          need: Water, Clay, sketches, glass shads and metal bits on occasion. 
          I know there is all you would need in Kelethin, but not sure of other 
          places. The sketch seller is right at the orc lift, I believe, and the 
          merchant with the rest is between him and the priest lift. If you are 
          elsewhere, ask around. someone has got to have done pottery before.<BR>
          &nbsp;Rule #5: Patience: During those first 50 points it will be difficult, 
          since you will be constantly losing money. Remember, even if you make 
          nothing, you can still gain points, and that is what you are after. 
          when you get to around 60 ro so, it gets better.<BR>
          &nbsp;Ok, now to start with the actual process. First, buy a book on 
          pottery found at any NPC potter. read through it to get the general 
          idea of how pottery is done. In the back are some recipes for ALMOST 
          everything a potter can make. Note: the recipe for the small bowl is 
          incorrect, and I'm not sure what the correct one is. Now , buy some 
          sketches, mostly the cheap stuff like small clay jars.You cannot make 
          large bowls yet, so don't even try. buy the clay indicated and try making 
          one by putting the sketch, clay and water onto the potter's wheel and 
          combining. If you succeed, take the unfinished product to the oven and 
          fire it on the correct sheet. This is 3/4 of what pottery is, repetition. 
          After small clay jars become trivial, move to medium clay jars. They 
          sell for a little more, but you still won't make a profit because they 
          cost more, too.&nbsp; <BR>
          &nbsp;After medium clay jars, i would suggest medium bowls. Though you 
          will make very few of them, they only cost a lot in firing, and messing 
          up the initial making will still give you points. At about 55 or so, 
          you should begin to make the more expensive items. <BR>
          &nbsp;Pie tins and Cake rounds should be your next target. Until now 
          you should have been making about a 150% profit on the successful items. 
          Here is where it changes. Pie tins and Cake rounds sell for about the 
          same, depending on who you are selling them to it could be as high as 
          300%. If you made every third or fourth Pie tin, you would be breaking 
          even. And Pie tins and cake rounds will not become trivial until 115, 
          where you will be making 4 out of 5. At 115, you will be a master potter. 
          <BR>
          &nbsp;I have yet to find something better than pie tins to make, since 
          large bowls cost more in materials and sell for a lot less. <BR>
          &nbsp;One thing that I have not yet found is the recipe for the "small 
          clay idol", which will be a difficult task since the templates which 
          I'm almost certain that you need cost over 5 gp. if you have any info, 
          please email me at <A HREF="file:///C%7C/Pkzip/Web%20Pages/backup/everstat/Nyajin@Hotmail.com">Nyajin@Hotmail.com</A>. 
          <BR>
          &nbsp;Well friend, now you have a basic understanding of pottery. I 
          wish you well.<BR>
