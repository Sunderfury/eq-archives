<H3 align=center>Navigation in Norath using the /loc command:</H3>
<blockquote>
<UL>
<LI>/loc command gives your x,y,z coordinates.  Each zone has its individual sets independent of any other zone.  In other words, every zone has its 0,0,0 point somewhere within it and the zone spreads out from there.
<LI>North is +X, South is -X, West is +Y, East is -Y.  Z effects elevation.
<LI>/loc also gives you your current facing.
<LI>0 is facing North, 128 facing West, 256 facing South, and 384 is facing East.
<LI>The game gives coordinates all the way down into decimal digits. (X=145.35). A single step will change the whole digets, so for player purposes, the decimal numbers are unnecessary.  Because of this, I will be giving the location of key points using whole number x,y coordinates.
<LI>It is a good idea to have the /loc key set up on your hotkey pad.  This will make it easy for you to write down key locations you come to. <LI>If you character is about to die, hit /loc.  You will have an exact corpse location in your chat log.
