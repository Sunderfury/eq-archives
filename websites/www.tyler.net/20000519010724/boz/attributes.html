<P>STRENGTH
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Strength determines the weight you can carry before becoming encumbered.
<P><LI>The higher your strength, the larger the weapon you can wield in combat without losing your stamina.
<P><LI>Strength has a direct impact on your attack value.  Increase your strength, and you increase your ability to force that blow through your enemy's defences.
</UL>
<P>STAMINA
<UL>
<LI>Stamina impacts directly on the number of your initial hit points and the number of hit points you will gain upon reaching each new level.
<P><LI>A high stamina allows you to continue a tiring activity for a longer period of time.  You can run farther without a break.  You will be able to swing that overweight lead staff of thumping more times without becoming exhausted.
</UL>
<P>AGILITY
<UL>
<LI>Agility influences armor class.  An agile troll will lead a longer life than a slog-footed one.
</UL>
<P>DEXTERITY
<UL>
<LI>Dexterity is said to influence your chance of striking an opponent in melee combat.
<P><LI>Dexterity should increase your chances with ranged weapon attacks as well.  
<P><LI>I have seen no direct impact of dexterity on character abilities.  A higher dexterity does not increase your attack value as I believe it is intended to do.
</UL>
<P>WISDOM
<UL>
<LI>Wisdom determines the shaman's mana and shaman spell success.
<P><LI>Wisdom increase a character's ability to save versus spells that impact the mind.
<P><LI>Wisdom cannot be raised with any shaman spells.  All the physical attributes and even charisma can be raised this way.  Because of this, I recommend the starting shaman place as many bonus attribute points into wisdom as is allowed.
</UL>
<P>Intelligence
<UL>
<LI>A high intellingence allows a troll to learn skills at a faster rate this his less-gifted peers.
</UL>
<P>Charisma
<UL>
<LI>Charisma effects how NPC's react to your character.
<P><LI>A higher charisma will lower prices at merchants.
<P><LI>Everyone hates a troll anyway, so why worry about it?
