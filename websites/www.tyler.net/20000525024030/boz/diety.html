<blockquote>
CAZIC-THULE:<br>  Followers of Cazic-Thule, The Faceless, fear their Lord and believe that only by causing terror in others will they be spared his vengeful wrath.  They strive to beat down and suppress all hope.  Fear rules their lives and through fear they rule the lives of others.  Pain, misery, violence, torture, living sacrifice; these are the tools of a Cazicite.  Many Lizardman tribes are devout followers of Cazic-Thule, but his number of humanoid followers grows daily, a cold shadow slowly engulfing the bright spots of Norrath in a nightmare of horror and pain.
<UL>
<P><LI>Trolls and Ogres can both be followers of this Diety.
<P><LI>The Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule in Feerrott would be an ideal place for the Faceless One's followers to hold player ran quests and role-playing events.

<img align=right src=innpic.gif width=155 height=196 alt="Innoruuk"><blockquote>INNORUUK:<BR>  Followers of Innoruuk, The Prince of Hate, include nearly the entire Dark Elven race who regard him as their "Father."  They believe that Hate is a creative force, or rather "THE" creative force in the universe.  Creativity born of destruction.  Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain it.  It is only through the total disdain of your enemies that you can gain true power over them.  Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness.  It is the honest belief of the followers of Innoruuk that if they were to hate strong enough they could destroy all of Norrath.
<UL>
<P><LI>Trolls and Dark Elves can both worship Innoruuk.
<P><LI>Innoruuk is an optimal diety choice for those trolls that plan on spending a lot of time in the dark elf city.
