<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT>ABJURE</DT>
<DD>Magical skill used to determine the effectiveness of the following spells: <B>Endure Cold, Inner Fire, Endure Fire, Scale Skin, Endure Disease, Spirit of the Bear, Endure Poison, Burst of Strength, Turtle Skin, Cancel Magic, Endure Magic, Frenzy</B>
<P>
<DT>ALCHEMY</DT>
<DD>Shaman receive this skill at 25th level.  A medicine bag is used to combine various herbs to make useful potions.
<P>
<DT>ALCOHOL TOLERANCE</DT>
<DD>The greater your skill level, the more alcohol you can consume before blurred vision, slurred speech, and staggering hits your character.  Five short beers totally wiped out my character with no skill in this.
<P>
<DT>ALTER</DT>
<DD>Magical skill used to determine the effectiveness of the following spells: <B>Strengthen, Minor Healing, Cure disease, Dexterous Aura, Gate, Cure Poison, Feet Like Cat, Drowsy, Fleeting Fury, Light Healing, Cure Blindness, Spirit of Wolf, Bind Affinity, Enduring Breath, Root, Levitate, Disempower, Spirit of Snake, Walking Sleep, Healing, Malise, Spirit of Monkey, Spirit Strength</B>
<P>
<DT>BAKING</DT>
<DD>No personal experience with this skill.
<P>
<DT>BEG</DT>
<DD>The only thing I have ever gotten from begging is slaughtered from the NPC I tried to beg from.  I have never used this skill higher than skill level 15, so perhaps it is more successful at higher levels.  I'm sure charisma and character class impact on this in some way also.
<P>
<DT>BIND WOUND</DT>
<DD>If you have bandages (6 silver each), you can apply these to a wounded character, healing a very small amount of damage.  I have little experience in using this skill.
<P>
<DT>BREWING</DT>
<DD><I>Fer dem trolls wan make tastie drinkie b'fore bashem frogs, de brew materials be behind de bar in Grobb. De still be in de bar of Oggok to mixem. But, dont go past de Oggok bar into de warrior guild or Cranik killem troll on sight.
A troll build up a mighty thirst after weez bashem gud all night. - Bloc, ogre warrior</I>
<P>
<DT>CHANNEL</DT>
<DD>Competence in this skill is doubly important for a shaman.  Channelling determines how long it takes to cast a spell.  Channelling determines the chance of a melee attack against the caster interrupting his chance to finish casting.  A high channelling will decrease the time it takes to scribe new spells.  Channelling goes up quickly.  I recommend purchasing one skill point in it at fourth level.  After that, channelling will go up by itself and stay near maximum as your character ages.
<P>
<DT>COMMON TOUNGE</DT>
<DD>This is the disgusting bird-chirpy like tounge used by the humans.  All races are proficient in this tounge.  Trolls learned it from the screams of tortured prisoners ringing through Grobb.
<P>
<DT>CONJURE</DT>
<DD>Magical skill used to determine the success of the following spells: <B>Sicken, Summon Drink, Spirit Pouch, Summon Food, Winged Courier, Tainted Breath, Infectious Cloud, Affliction, Insidious Fever, Envenomed Bolt</B>
<P>
<DT>DARK SPEECH</DT>
<DD>This tounge was developed to aid communication between Drow, Ogres, and Trolls during joint raids on the weak and prideful humies and their allies.
<P>
<DT>DEFENSE</DT>
<DD>Defense, agility, and armor are all factors combined to determine your character's armor class.  Defense is not trainable.  Only experience gained in combat will increase this skill.
<P>
<DT>DIVINATE</DT>
<DD>Magical skill used to determine the success of the following spells: <B>Flash of Light, Sense Magic, Spirit Sight, Sense Animals, Serpent Sight, Invisibility to Animals, Vision</B>
<P>
<DT>DODGE</DT>
<DD>The higher one's skill in dodge, the greater the chance that they can sidestep a foe's melee attack.
<P>
<DT>EVOKE</DT>
<DD>Magical skill used to determine the success of the following spells: <B>Burst of Flame, Frost Rift, Spirit Strike</B>
<P>
<DT>FLETCHING</DT>
<DD>No personal experience with this skill.
<P>
<DT>HAND TO HAND</DT>
<DD>When you are caught weaponless, this skill determines your chance of punching your foe.  I highly recommend spending one beginning point at level one on Hand to Hand.  That one point of skill will increase the maximum damage you can cause with a punch.  Hand to hand rises very slowly.
<P>
<DT>JEWEL CRAFT</DT>
<DD>No personal experience with this skill.
<P>
<DT>MEDITATE</DT>
<DD>Meditation restores mana at an increased rate.  Meditation shortens spell memorization time.  Spend one point on meditation at eighth level.  Meditation raises very quickly and will stay near maximum as you raise in levels.
<P>
<DT>OFFENSE</DT>
<DD>Offense, strength, and weapon skill level combine to determine a character's attack ability.  Offense is not trainable.  Only experience gained in combat will raise offense.
<P>
<DT>ONE HAND BLUNT</DT>
<DD>This skill determines your success when wielding a club, hammer, mace or staff with one hand.  Weapon skills such as one hand blunt combine with strength and offense to determine your attack value.
<P>
<DT>PIERCING</DT>
<DD>I have never encountered or even seen mentioned a piercing weapon that is wieldable by a Shaman.  If one is out there, this skill would determine your success with it.  IMHO, I'd love to wield a razor sharp, gem encrusted, magical sacrificial shaman dagger.  Perhaps there is one out there just waiting to be found.
<P>
<DT>POTTERY</DT>
<DD>No personal experience with this skill.
<P>
<DT>SENSE HEADING</DT>
<DD>Success with this skill will give you your facing to the nearest of eight compass directions.  When you fail, you will get a message telling you that you cannot determine which direction you are facing.  No false headings are given from failure.
<P>
<DT>SMITHING</DT>
<DD><I>Fer dem troll wanna be u smith. Der be a forge in Oggok metal armor store.  De troll kin buy de ore an de sharpening stone from a troll on de path to de Shadowknight Guild in Grobb. Den troll buy moldies an book from Ogre (if u stand with yer back to the entrance of Okkrog, turn right and look for some caveman huts, she be there). Den de forge it in de Ogre metal armor shop. - Bloc, ogre warrior</I>
<p>
<DT>SPECIALIZE</DT>
<DD>At level 30, the shaman can use the specialize skill to create his own magic spells.
<P>
<DT>SWIMMING</DT>
<DD>As this skill increases, so does the speed at which you move through deep water.
<P>
<DT>TAILORING</DT>
<DD>This skill allows the character to craft patchwork and/or leather armor using the hides of animals.  A skill of (15) allows the user to craft a patchwork tunic.  Troll armor requires the hides of large creatures, namely bears.  To make the armor, the character must purchase a sewing kit and a pattern for the specific piece of armor wanted.  The hide and the pattern are placed into the sewing kit and "combined".  If the skill succeeds, the piece of armor is made.  If it fails, both the hide and the pattern are lost.  The sewing kit is reusable.<br>
<I>Tailoring, when combined with blacksmithing, will allow the tailor 
to create studded leather and banded armor.  The tailor will need a 
large sewing kit, medium and high quality pelts plus studs or braces 
made by a blacksmith. - Detritus, troll shaman.</I>

<P>
<DT>TROLL TOUNGE</DT>
<DD>Bohica's native language.  This gutteral collection of growls, grunts, and groans insures secrecy when trolls prepare their excursions against the shorties.
<P>
<DT>TWO HAND BLUNT</DT>
<DD>For sheer damage potential in melee combat, the shaman chooses to fight two handed with a blunt weapon.  A two-handed war hammer is a prized possession indeed for the up and coming shaman.  Weapon skill, strength, and offense ratings combine to determine a character's attack rating.
