2/21/99  Bohica, now 9th level and in possession of the reknowned spell "Spirit of Wolf" decides to cross the great desert of Rho in search of human rump roast.  Shouting out his intentions throughout the swamp and inviting all comers resulted in a single ally for Bohica on this hunt.  Blood thirsty troll shadowknight Locnar joined Bohica and they set off on their evil mission.  Leaving a path of smashed puma's in their wake, the pair arrive in Northern Ro.  Near the outskirts of a Dervish camp, they encounter their first bounty - the corpses of four human adventurers.  Grabbing what they could carry and eating their fill of flesh, they continued slightly north to the edge of the desert.  It was here that they encountered their first victim.  Poor Genoin did not last long against the feindish might of the pair and soon their packs were full for the coming night's feast.  As they contemplated the return to Grobb, what did they see on the horizon?  It was the troll delicacy, a halfling, strolling near the grasses' edge.  Such a treat cannot be passed by easily.  So it was that Locnar and Bohica fell upon halfling.  The furry-foot, facing superior numbers and a superior race, rightly retreated to the guard nearby and our green-skinned anti-heros pulled behind a dune to regroup.  Then the trip went bad.  The halfling was not nearly so alone as he looked.  He came back with a vengence, bringing Lilriva, Fyrehart, Hypoluxa, Genion, Grogfu, and Grogan with him.  Bohica stood his ground for the initial onslaught, allowing Locnar to seek refuge beneath the nearby waves of the sea.  Finally, out of mana and surrounded by shorties, Bohica set off for the Oasis of Marr and the path to home.  Suddenly, roots grew out from the surrounding sand.  Bohica froze in his tracks as his pursuers closed the gap.  Spells, swords, and more roots finished Bohica in short order.  All-in-all, it was a great, in-character battle.  I congratulate the enemy on their teamwork and prowess.
