Site</a> and look in the How-To's!</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>EverHack MC Version 1.0
is now released and you can download it here.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The EverHack MC developement
have stopped, cause I have left EverQuest and join now Ashrons Call. The
reason is simple. EverQuest is static. The only thing that isn't static
is yourself and all other player. Verrant tried to great a thing they dont
have experience with. Okay everything must have a first start, but not
such a bad one. The only thing I got from Everquest and Verrant since I
joined was only making everything more worse than it was. As I can remember
there was only one really great game event and that was on Halloween. Secondly
all the the rules they created and enhanched made thing more unreal (Dont
help Newbie, No KS, No Cheating and and).</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As this is a cheating
page I have to spend some words on cheating. Cheating is at my point the
only way to get Verrant open there eyes. Secondly cheating is normal, in
rl there is cheating too (not cheat the stats of yourself up, but there
are cheaters). Banning me was a huge mistake, now Iam raising my godly
weapon. I will write an special EverHack Version with that you can make
your own cheater or enhanche EverHack and release it in Source Code. Just
cheat them knee deep in dead. Kick their ass. Finish em.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Some words to EverHack
MC. If Verrant does an patch of eqgame.exe EverHack will surly not work
anymore, but therefore I made a file which is in your EverHack/Data directory.
Filename is Offsets.dat. In this file are all the offsets EverHack need
currently. It looks just like this</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>6252724</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>8083704</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>8077064</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>6254484</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>116</font></font></b></blockquote>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Where the first line
is the Offset of the adress of your taget and the second line is the offset
of the adress to yourself. The third and fourth line is the offset to the
Skills- and Spell-List. The last one is just how much bytes you have to
add from your chardata to get the Item-List. Remember all offsets are in
bytes not in hex.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I would be happy if you
all dont let EverHack die out (like EQ someday) and publish all you modified
offsets.dat.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Best Regards,</font></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Btw. My EQ-Name was Lucilla
or Naturon and I played on Solusek Ro. Please dont ask for my Items I was
banned and gave all to my friend. He may now be very lucky. Or Kunzmann?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Some words to Verrant:</font></font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Listen to what the player
want and dont try do thing that you think.</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Quests, quests are there
to make the game interactive. I felt like you dont have the skills to make
quests (What Verrant Dump? &lt;- This is a whole quest)</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Just remove the Idea of Guides,
they never answer with knowledge. If they ever answer.</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Your whole engine is very
bad and with standards of '94 (Like Duke Nukem 3D or Doom I)</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Your Server Suck, you have
to spend more money in this.</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Will you ever come out of
BETA?</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>And Players hat it if you
anncounce Server downtime 10 minutes and in real they are a half day or
more down.</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>All in simple german words:
"Ihr Bannanenbieger seit vollkommene Versager, packt ein und entwickelt
ein Schachspiel."</font></font></b></li>

<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Hey if you want to see some

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The next thing for me
is joining Ashrons Call, which is better in game system, server speed,
landscape optics, and much more. And thebest is they DON'T BANN YOU FOR
MAKING TOOLS, the best is they support Tools!! Look at their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/zone/asheronscall/">Website.</a>
See you in AC!</font></font></b></td>
