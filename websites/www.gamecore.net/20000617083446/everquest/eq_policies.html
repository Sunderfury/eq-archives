Lost Order of Akalabeth's Mission Statement:</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">The Lost
   Order of Akalabeth is a mature, multiple-game online community.
   Freejack, Brimstone, Ralineth, Ghoti, Brewman, Tasslehof, Zari,
   Carnifex and Avenger founded LOA in 1997. Guild members are held
   to a very strict and high level of honor, maturity, and dedication
   to guild, members and other players. Above all, we adhere to our
   motto, "Friendship Transcending Worlds".</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">LOA is at
   present composed of three factions, one for each of the main games
   we are involved with; Ultima Online, Everquest, and Asheron's
   Call. In Everquest, we play on the Veeshan server. If you wish to
   join us, we do require that you also play on Veeshan.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">LOA is devoted
   to role-playing and to ensuring the maximum enjoyment of EverQuest
   for as many players as possible. We strive to uphold the maturity
   and professionalism of our guild, both in role-playing and through
   our behavior with fellow players. We are a Guild firmly rooted in
   the concept of diversity for all that the term implies. We
   encourage our members to pursue any race or class so long as they
   continue to be fair and honorable players, and to respect fellow
   guilds and players.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">If you join the
   Lost Order of Akalabeth, you will be immersed in a tradition of
   friendship, honor, dedication and motivation. We truly enjoy the
   spirit of camaraderie that has grown up among us over the years,
   placing this above all else. If you honor each other and our
   guild, you will surely make a name for yourself in our ranks and
   in our history.</FONT></P>

   We have created several ways for you to participate such as: mIRC,

   If you make an attempt to meet others, IN and OUT of game, and
   show the Guild that you truly care - you will do just fine.</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">We realize that
   each person has his or her own amount of time that can be given

ICQ:</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Many of
   our Guild members have ICQ. We ask that when you become a member,
   you add your Unit members to your contact list, as well as the
   High Council members. This way, we can all communicate with each
   other and have a better chance of knowing who is online from our
   Guild. ICQ can be found at </FONT><A HREF="http://www.mirabilis.com"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">www.mirabilis.com</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">
   and is currently a free file and service.</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">We ask that as
   you add each member to your list, that you rename the entry to
   reflect the LOA suffix. (i.e. Brimstone should read:
   Brimstone_LOA). This process will help you to identify a guild
   member much faster in the case of an emergency.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Biographies
   may be added to your personal roster entry when you become a
   Commoner/Full Member. Photos (Real Life) and screenshots can be
   sent to Brimstone or Timbo. All members are allowed to have their
   very own biography page. This helps form your character history
   and identity with our guild and in EQ. This is not a mandatory
   requirement, but rather a benefit of membership.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

and Class:</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">We realize
   that EverQuest has several classes to choose from, as well as
   alignments and races. The LOA doesn't want to be a strict guild
   with limitations on our members. You have full control over who
   and what you want your characters to be. Good, bad, ugly, etc. All
   up to you. NO MATTER WHAT you choose to play, we will still
   require you to be a good PERSON behind the character. Don't curse
   at others, don't be rude or insulting, don't be an idiot, etc. Be
   worthy of trust, always.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#000080"><B>Policy on Guard
Killing:</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">In
   general, the LOA does not condone <B>repeated killing of static
   "Guard" NPC's who are placed in low- and mid-level zones for the
   protection of other players ("guard camping").</B><I> </I>This
   practice is unfair to low-level characters who rely on the guards
   to provide a "safe spot" to rest and meditate, as well as a spot
   for them to retreat to when they pull more combatants then they
   can safely handle (ie, a "train"). It is our opinion that Norrath
   holds plenty of options for high-level characters to gain wealth
   and experience without endangering the lives of others.</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Examples of
   NPC's covered under this policy would include (but not be limited
   to) the Gnome, Dwarven, Barbarian, Erudite, Halfling, Troll, Ogre,
   and Dark Elf guards in their respective newbie zones, High and
   Wood Elf guards in Greater Feydark, Human Guards in the Freeport,
   Queynos, and High Pass zones, as well as Human Guards at the
   outposts in the Commonlands and the Karanas.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Given that
   guards may be encountered anywhere within a zone, it should be
   stated that we would never ask a member to not act in their own
   self-defense. If a guard must be killed to save the life of a
   guildmate or friend, so be it. It is the intentional and repeated
   "camping" of guards, especially those with a static "spawn point",
   which we find objectionable.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#000080"><B>Policy on Player
Killing:</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">So long as
   it is within your characters profile to be a murderer, social
   outcast, etc., and so long as you strive to uphold the
   role-playing elements of our guild and EverQuest, you may do
   whatever you see fit within the game. Since EQ has a PK-switch, it
   is fair play for you to engage in PKing and PVP within EQ.</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Several of our
   members have created characters on the Vallon Zek Team PvP server
   on the "shorty" (halfling-dwarf-gnome) team. The overwhelming
   majority of our activities remain focused on the Veeshan server,
   but we may become more active on Vallon Zek at some point in the
   future.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Looting Rules:</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000"><I>The

   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">First I'd like
   to clarify and repeat the looting system that I think is fairest
   to use when we have a full-LOA group. With mixed guild groups, the
   system is commonly /Rand 100 for each item and nobody gets 2 items
   until everyone has at least one. A much better system can be used
   with a full LOA group. When the group gets a magical item, they
   run through a series of quick questions in order. And it can be
   done very quickly...</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">First of all,
   ignore issues of rarity, ignore secondary characters and everyone
   must get 1 item before anybody gets 2.<BR>

      Does a party member deserve this item without question? Maybe

      they have not gotten anything in months... This could include
      giving the item to someone for their secondary or giving it to
      somebody who is not even in the group. This only works with a
      unanimous agreement and anyone can nominate <I>another
      player</I> as being deserving. Often it is obvious that someone
      is desperate for a particular item, make their day by just

      and weight-reduction bags all count. You do not plan on trading
      the item or giving it to a secondary, it is meant for the
      character in the group who got the item and that character does
      not already have a better item. If multiple people in the group

      If nobody wants an item, usually because it would count as
      their loot and people don't want to waste their "looting
      ticket" (Everyone must get 1 item before anybody gets 2), then
      the item is considered as free loot and whoever wins a random
      roll gets it. That item does not count as loot and the same
      person could enter later random rolls. This usually happens

   element is not a series of rules, but some honor
   guidelines.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">First of all, if
   you have gotten an item in a group, do not enter random rolls
   until you are fairly sure that everyone else in the group has
   gotten an item as well, this could be two days later... If you
   want an item and can wear it, but somebody else REALLY can use it
   better, let them have it (a typical example could be a cleric and
   a warrior both wanting a Thick Banded Belt, it would be nice of
   the cleric to just let the Warrior have the belt).</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Finally, if
   somebody has already gotten their loot for this "round" but some
   new item comes up that they are the only one to need, they can ask
   the group to /rand their earlier item in exchange for being given
   the new one. This assumes nobody else wants the item under
   scenario 2. For example, imagine a group of 3 people, Warrior,
   Cleric, Druid. Only the Warrior has gotten something so far under
   scenario 3 (it's for trade/sale). They then find an item that ONLY
   the warrior wants under scenario 2. He asks if he can take the new
   item and the others can /rand his original item between them. No
   problem you say, what if the first item was a crap monk item but
   the new one is a Flowing Black Silk Sash... The other two could
   wear or use that sash for an incredible trade and by the basic
   rule of "nobody gets two items until everyone gets one", the
   warrior is theoretically eliminated from the roll. It can get iffy
   but don't let your greed get the better of you.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Basically, the
   idea is to try to make sure that everyone gets something, and
   preferably something they want to use themselves. But be generous
   and allow people to switch a scenario 3 item for a new scenario 2
   item if nobody else wants that new item under scenario 2. Does
   this make sense? All this relies on YOU to be generous and to
   consider your friends needs, it shouldn't be too hard... Some
   items are just amazing: Ysehkas, Thick Banded Belts, FBSS etc. To
   be honourable, all those who fall under scenario 2 could have the
   option of joining the random roll and if they win, giving any
   previously won items back to the group to be
   redistributed.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">One other point,
   if you get an item, but then trade that item away, you should NOT
   enter the roll for the next one the group gets under scenario 2.
   So lets say a tank gets a FBSS one day and trades it for two
   swords and a shield, they should not enter the roll for another
   FBSS until everyone else who can wear it in the group has gotten
   one. These are not rules but suggestions. The scenario 1-4 rules
   can be broken if people agree unanimously. Its not worth ruining
   someone elses day by being greedy... If you want an item for a
   secondary character, I'm afraid you'll have to wait to get it
   under scenarios 1, 3 or 4. </FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
