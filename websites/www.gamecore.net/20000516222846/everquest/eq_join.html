Program</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">We have
   over 150 members at this time, and we are not looking to expand at
   a rapid pace. Therefore we are cautiously monitoring who is
   applying to our guild and serious about the commitment involved in
   joining a guild such as the LOA. We embrace the phrase "quality
   over quantity".</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">The road to
   membership is a long one, but potentially very rewarding. It
   begins simply enough; get to know our members, both on our
   Conclave (Forum) and in-game. Issuing the command /w all lost
   lists all LOA members on-line at any one time. You may want to
   take a look at the page describing our Guide program, as our
   </FONT><A HREF="eq_guides.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Norrathian
   Guides</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">
   will be your best source for information about
   membership.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Our "initiation"
   phase is a two-way street. It is designed not only to ensure that
   LOA continues to recruit the best possible members, but also to
   ensure that prospective members understand who we are and what we
   are about.</FONT></P>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">We have recently
   implemented a new, automated application system. The following
   represent a significant change from our past policy for the
   Everquest faction. If you have questions about our Initiation
   process, or suggestions on how to improve it, please share them
   with </FONT><A HREF="mailto:Timbo_LOA@hotmail.com"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Timbo</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">,

Phase</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">We
   strongly recommend getting to know several of our members, and
   thoroughly reviewing our web site, before completing an
   application for our Petitioner Program.</FONT>
   <FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Note that your
   application requires the approval of at least three Full Members
   to be accepted, and also that your application will expire after
   seven days if you have not received the requisite number of
   vouches. If you fail to receive three vouches the first time you
   apply, this does NOT mean that we don't want you to join the
   Order; it simply means that you need to spend some time getting to
   know us before re-applying.</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">You will receive
   an email notifying you of your acceptance into our Initiate phase.
   This represents our formal acknowledgement of your desire to join
   our ranks, and that you have earned the respect of at least three
   of our Full Members.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

Phase</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Once you
   are accepted as an Initiate, you are strongly encouraged to meet
   and group with as many full members as possible. Elevation to the
   next step of membership will require three additional "vouches"
   from full members (for a total of six vouches), so it is in your
   best interest to be as visible as possible. Group with members
   in-game, role-play with us, post stories and game tidbits to our
   Conclave&#133; the sky's the limit! See the </FONT><A HREF="eq_cmnr.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Commoner/Initiate</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">

Phase</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">After
   spending a minimum of 30 days as an Initiate, you will be eligible
   for Commoner status. If you are voted in, you will receive your
   "tags" at that time from a guild officer. This is your opportunity
   to get to know even more members, since elevation to full
   membership requires three additional "vouches" (for a grand total
   of nine). You will spend a minimum of one month as a Commoner,
   after which time you will be eligible for full membership. We
   strongly encourage Commoners to join us in our weekly mIRC
   meetings, so that you may gain a better impression of how our
   guild governs itself - see the </FONT><A HREF="eq_policies.html"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Mission/Policies</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">
   page at left for details on our weekly meetings.</FONT>
   
   <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Voting for Full
   Members occurs around the 15th of each month, so some Commoners
   will spend more time at this stage than others.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

membership</B></FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana" COLOR="#800000">Once you
   are accepted into our family, many things will take place. You
   will be granted higher security clearances in our Chat Room
   (Private Shrine on IRC), added to our mailing lists, given access
   to our "Real Life" forum, added to our Roster Pages, have the
   option for creating a character biography, granted voting rights,
   and the private guild structures will be open to you.</FONT>
