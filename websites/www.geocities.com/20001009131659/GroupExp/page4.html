but I'm Level 50-something...</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">In a player's 50's, he or she
will find that the experience system works in much the same way
it did when they were a newbie. Consider our newbie group a few
months down the road when they are in their 50's fighting a level
60 critter:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">The situation
looks much the same as it did 50-some-odd levels ago. In terms of
total xp, the Troll SK is still at the top of the heap, as
expected since he requires so much xp to level. As well, the
Halfling Warrior is still at the bottom, since he requires so
much less xp than the Troll. And in fact, you'll notice that the
slopes here aren't quite as steep as they were when we were
newbies. Remember the curve from level 1 to 60? And do you
remember how steep it got toward the end? You are now seeing the
effects of the xp formula as it applies to high level characters.
Quite honestly, in 50 kills they have made very little progress
toward gaining the next level; and in fact, it would require a
little over 1,000 kills (as a group) in order for all these
players to level (this is an estimate, of course). And again, let's
look at how each player is progressing toward his/her next level:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">As I mentioned,
they are making VERY slow progress toward their levels; however,
they are all advancing at the same rate relative to their
individual Race/Class experience curve.</font></p>
