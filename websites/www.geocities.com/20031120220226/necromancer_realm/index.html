	   <h3>Another New Website Update</h3>
           <h3><i>Attention, New Website Down Again, Should Be Back Up Tonight.</i></h3>

	   <h4>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, most of the problems with the new site have been resolved. I'm revamping the database support at the moment, but as a bonus, I've got the new forums up. They don't exactly look necromancer-ish at the moment, but I'm working on it. I've also switched to using mySQL for the database backend of the site, something that i've been working on for a while. Hopefully the website will be alot faster. You can find the new website by clicking here: <a class=nav href="http://24.125.106.229/">Take Me To The New Website!</a>. Enjoy, and hopefully by the end of the week, I'll have section commenting up and rolling.

	   <h3>Yet Another New Website Update</h3>

	   <h4>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it would figure. Apparently the new website is having some issues at the moment. I'm unable to figure out what the issues are at the moment, because I can't take a look at the server from here, but as soon as I get a chance to do so, I'll have the site back up and running. Well, on the up side, this is what beta testing is all about.

<h2>Tuesday October 28th, 2003</h2>
 
	   <h3>Another New Website Update</h3>

	   <h4>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, since we only got one e-mail from anyone asking to beta test the website. Everyone who comes here, just got invited to participate. You can get to the new website by clicking <a class=nav href="http://24.125.106.229/">Here</a>. <b>Please don't bookmark the new page</b>, If you want to be sure to be able to connect to the page at all times, check here for the proper link. The website is being hosted through my cable modem service and since I haven't gotten Dynamic Addressing up yet, I can't have a domain name that automagically connects you to my server, when my IP address changes. Please keep in mind that this website is a work in progress, if you see errors, or something that isn't right, please Email me. Over the next week or so I'll hopefully be getting things down and making them work properly. Thank you all for your continued support of the Necromancer's Realm.

<h2>Monday September 22nd, 2003</h2>
 
	   <h3>New Website Update</h3>

	   <h4>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new website is coming along nicely. I've had to recreate the forums, as the forum I was using didn't exactly work the way I wanted it to. Anyway, I've got about 90% of the new website done, What I'm going to need now is some beta testers for the new site. If anyone would like to volunteer to help me test the site, please send me an e-mail by clicking on my name below. Just to give you a complete update of what's in the new site:
<ul>
<li>13,157 Mobs across most zones All Searchable</li>
<li>20,897 Distinct Items All searchable</li>
<li>4,000+ Individual Spells Searchable by Class and Cross Referenced with Items</li>
<li>Guide repository containing just over 40 guides</li>
<li>New beginning Necromancer guide.</li>
<li>Complete City Guide of Norrath and Luclin</li>
<li>Complete list of any/all focus effects available in the game(Cross referenced with items)</li>
<li>AAXP Guide, including recommendations for where and when to get them.</li>
<li>The list could go on.</li>
</ul>
Hopefully all these things will peak your interests a little.

	   <h3>Annoying Virus</h3>

	   <h4>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, of all the annoying viruses going around, it would seem that the effects of one of the viruses(or is it Virii?)has affected my Email inbox. I've been pummelled with around seven-hundred or so Email messages containing the Sobig.F virus in the past day and a half. So.. If any of you tried to send Email in my direction in the past day or so, it probably didn't make it because my inbox has been at its limit constantly. Word to the wise everyone, get some good virus software. It just saves you and everyone else alot of hassle. Not that I'm complaining mind you, but since I do run the news here I figured I'd give everyone the information they need to get rid of this virus. The virus is named: W32.Sobig.F@mm <br><br>Here is a link to Symantec's website for the removal instructions and information on what the virus does:<br><br><a class=nav href="http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sobig.f@mm.html">http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.sobig.f@mm.html</a><br><br>
Thanks in advance for helping solve a problem.

	   <h3>New Feature in LDoN</h3>

	   <h4>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Everquest Live website:<br><br>
<blockquote><i>
Lost Dungeons of Norrath will introduce a new EverQuest feature: Interactive Objects! These are boxes, vases, chests and similar objects that might contain treasures. There are several ways to interact with these objects: 
Anyone can inspect an object. This will tell you something about the object, but be careful, some of these objects may be trapped. Poking at a trapped object them might set the trap off. Characters with the appropriate skills can Sense or Disarm traps on these objects. They may also be locked, so someone with a Pick Lock skill may be useful to open them. But, failing that, there will be a few spells that can allow you to open locked objects. 
And, for the more brutal folks, it's possible to just bash them apart, though this has a very good chance of setting off any traps that may be hidden in the object.</i></blockquote>

<h2>Tuesday August 5th, 2003</h2>


	   
	   <h3>New Item Type in LDoN</h3>

	   <h4>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, according to the official Lost Dungeons Of Norrath&trade; website, a new ability for items is coming into the game. Just look:<br>
<blockquote><i>
The Lost Dungeons of Norrath introduces an exciting new type of treasure to EverQuest. Using new modular items gained from dungeon adventures, characters are able to modify the powers and effects of their equipment, allowing for a tremendous amount of customization.<br><br>

Using these new items, characters can augment an existing breastplate, for example. Bonding the proper augmentation item to the breastplate might give it +5 strength. Bonding a different augmentation item could give it +6 wisdom. These are just a few simple examples; the new items have a wide variety of possible effects and benefits.
<br><br>
Have a helmet that you like, but think needs a little boost? This new item system allows you to customize that helmet and make it fit your character's needs better. Most characters have a favorite item that they've had in their bank for a while. They don't want to destroy it because it holds some memories, a link to the adventures they had gaining it. With this new item augmentation system, those items gain new life and endless potential!
<br><br></i></blockquote>
Looks pretty nifty to us. Can't wait to see it implemented into the game.

	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, since it'll be at least another week before I can have the new site go live, I updated the equipment section to actually show some equipment. It's just a pull from the database I've got. Not all the sections are working just yet, but I am working to get them done today. If any of the stats on the items seems out of whack or anything please let me know by zipping me an Email. Happy Hunting.<br><br></h4>

	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been working on the new site for the past two weeks now. I'm close to being finished. I just added 20,910 Items to the database and it's all fully searchable. Also, I've added every single spell and focus effect in the game to the database. Right now, I'm plowing through the 6,210 Mobs in the database and trying to associate them with the Items. When the new site does go live, I may not have all the Mobs associated with Items, but you can help. Within the new site you can submit correction to anything on the site with a click of a button. I've also pulled the old forum database into the new one so that will be available as well. I just wanted to let everyone know what was happening on the coding side of the website. Happy Hunting!</h4>

	   <h3>New Host</h3>

	   <h4>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, We'd like to thank you all for the flood of ideas that came in once we asked for help for hosting. I think we've found the cheapest and most reliable source of hosting that we can do. Hopefully in the next week or two, the new site will be up, and we may actually have our own domain to go with it. But we'll see what happens. Thank you all for your continued support. You guys are the main reason I'm trying to get this up and running. Well, here's to a spiffy new site, hosted by yours truly.

	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspWell, in an attempt to actually host the site somewhere that won't randomly bring the site down, alas, we've got no choice but to take the site to a pay-for-service host. If you got to see the new site, before brinkster so annoyingly brought it down, and liked what you saw, just click on the donate button over on the left. We're trying to raise enough money to get the site hosted somewhere, and keep it up. If anyone out there has any ideas about where we should host the new site, zip me an Email at Necromancer_Realm@Yahoo.com Thanks for your continued support.</h4>
