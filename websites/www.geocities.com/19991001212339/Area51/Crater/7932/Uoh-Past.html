<font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">
<p>Long Long ago, about 700 to 900 years ago, there lived a Youthfull Warrior of about age 10.  Born into royal blood the name of the young man was known to be Lagorath Dragon.  Taught in the city of Magincia of the way of Masterful Swordsmanship and Glorius Archery.  He was a quick learner and by age 15 was able to defeat some of the elder warriors.  This angred the elders and he was sent asail on a small ship.  Reaching the lands of Serpents Hold he found himself a wife and was wed that day.  A couple years later they had a child, Acid Dragon.  The boy was no normal child, he had an essence of a god.  His eyes seemed to pierce your soul.  Learning quick he attended school for only 4 years, accomplishing everything a normal human would take 18-20 years.  He then attended weapon training schools, and after mastering his training he studied the anchient arcane arts of Magic.  He had gotten all the knowledge of a Scholar and was still very young, only about 12 years of age.</p>  
<p>Then his father was called to a meeting one day at a  newly discovered entrance into a mountain.  Someone had discovered an old arcane pentagram in the mountain.  When Lagorath stepped close to the intricate design he felt a strange aura, then... something came through, a monstrous creature, about as tall as 12 feet, red and huge horns.  The creature picked up and devoured Lagorath... then it continued to slaughter every person, one after another, but one, a small messanger boy.  Soon Acid Dragon got the news, in extreme fear and anger he ran back to home to find comfort of his mother and bring her the dreaded news.  This was too much for him to take.  He told his mother that me must go.  He crafted a small raft, grabbed what food he could, and set asail.  He stayed out for several months, soon he decided to give up hope....but his life didnt seem to end.  He hadnt eaten for 3 months now, he pondered about how he could be surviving.  He reached the shores of Ocello and there he crafted a small house.  Here he found two of his best friends, Fire Draco, and Thorax.  Now almost 800 years of age, Acid Dragon wishes to seek out the darkness that killed his father and purify the threat with his sword.  He wishes revenge but also wishes to accomplish what his father had wanted that he never reached.  Fame, Glory, Riches, and Serenity.</p>
