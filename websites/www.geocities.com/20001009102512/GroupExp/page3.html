<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Ok, so if I'm that
Halfling Warrior, does this mean my group is ripping me off?</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">At first glance,
you might think the answer is yes, and you would be partly
correct. It is true that you are receiving a small share of the
experience being awarded to the group, and therefore you are
leveling more slowly than you would if you went solo. However,
how many Halfling Warriors do you know that can solo to level 60?
Let's see how this group looks graphically:</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Look at Player 2 -
that's the Troll ShadowKnight. Looks like he's making off like a
bandit, doesn't it? And there's our Halfling Warrior, Player 1,
way down there at the bottom, hardly getting anything for his
trouble... or is he? Let's take another look, this time looking
at the progress each player is making toward his next level:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img

width="469" height="316"></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF">When you look at the same
numbers again as a percentage of xp each member requires to level,
the entire group is on a level playing field now. Some of you may
have noticed that there seem to be group members missing from the
above graph. They are still there, but they aren't visible
because some Race/Class combinations present in the group use the
same multipliers, and so their curves overlap. But the main thing
to take from this graph is this: theoretically, if you put 6
people in a group that each just reached the same level, </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>they will all level again at the same
time</strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF"> as long as they remain
grouped the entire time. In other words, within a group, </font><font
color="#FF0000"><strong>each member advances at the same rate
relative to their individual xp curve</strong></font><font
color="#FFFFFF">, all other things being equal.</font></p>
