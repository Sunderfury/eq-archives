      UPDATE : 
    </STRONG>
  </FONT>
  Ok I am slack...I let the real world get in the way agian.  But I have made some changes.  Some good and 
  bad results have come about. So these are the changes :
  <UL>
    <LI> Fixed the bug where only the name showed up on personal pages for netscape users....problem with my template for the page.
	<LI> Work around for Netscape users that have a problem with popup windows...Use the alternate link
	<LI> Changed the Monk Info Form.  Fixed a bug and minor additions and changes
	<LI> 3 Monk list pages exist, By Name, By Level and By Server 
  </UL>
</P>
<P>
  I am still working on my parser.  It isn't handling updates in the old format.  So check your info.  If it is wrong then
  go to the page and enter in the data that has changed.  This whole system is based around your login ID so as long as that
  is the same all other info can change.  Also if you don't see your monk the resubmit it.  I had a whole batch of form 
  results that had errors like missing monk names or login id's and the like. 
</P>
<P>
  Thank you for your feedbacks.  I'm getting corrected with my spelling.....thats good.....and no it isn't a Aussie/American
  spelling thing because tho I live here in South Australia, I am a Boston Boy...only been here 4 years out of my 29 years of
  my life.
</P>
<P>
  Last I WILL notify everyone that has applied to The Chapter.

  Ok as you probable noticed things look just a little different.  This is in preperation for telling the EQ world 
  about this site.  Currently about the only ones that know the site exsists is the mailing list.  I will finish writing
  my utilities for this site hopefully this weekend.  Until that happens no new votes will be placed up on the site. 
  You can still send them and they will be processed in a couple of days.  The simple fact is that if I advertise the  
  site on EQ-Vault and EQ Statistics and some of the other sites then I will not be able to keep up with the maintance
  of this site let alone add new features.  Which brings me to my next topic: <BR>
  <BR>
  I want this to be an interactive site.  I have gotten a few offers of help with different stuff.  One thing I would
  really like to see added to this site is a Research Article section.  This is where one or more of us completely 
  investigates an aspect about our ability.  One example would be "How Weight Effects Combat".  If you think you would
  like to do an article please <A HREF="Submission.html">contact me</A> before starting.  I will shove up the idea to 
  <FONT COLOR="#946828" FACE="CELTICMD, ARIAL" SIZE="+1">
    <B>T</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#946828" FACE="TIMES">he</FONT>
  <FONT COLOR="#946828" FACE="CELTICMD, ARIAL" SIZE="+1">
    <B>C</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#946828" FACE="TIMES">hapter</FONT>.  This isn't to accept the idea as I will accept any
	research done but more to get more senarios for you to run through.  Same reason I got a panel of monks to nut out
	issues of petitions.....7 heads are better than 1 at looking at a problem from all sides.  Some ideas will really need
	more than one monk to research to so if you have a friend that will help great.  I have alot of ideas too so if you
	want to do the research but don't know what to research then <A HREF="Submission.html">contact me</A>.
	<BR>
	<BR>
	Also with the new utility shuld come a version of this site that works better with Netscape too.  I haven't forgot you guys

  Ok brothers and sisters...you made me sit back 8).<BR>  
<BR>
  First let me thank those who have registered their monks and voted.
<BR> 
  Things might seem a bit slow to update at first and I am working on speeding this up<BR>
<BR>
  Here is what I have been doing:<BR>
  <OL>
    <LI>Updated the monks list.
	<LI>Added a feed back page <A HREF="Submission.html">Dear Thentar</A>.
	<LI>Updated the Petition with new votes.
	<LI>Wrote some utily programs.
	<LI>Various Real World stuff like....My Job....How dare that get in the way.
  </OL>
  <BR>
  OK I will never tell you that <A HREF="MonksInformation.html">The Monks</A> has been updated 
  otherwise you would see it almost every day for a while I think.<BR>
  <BR>
  The feed back page <A HREF="Submission.html">Dear Thentar</A> is there to use feel free... 
  anything non-vulger is welcome to include telling my spelling is $#!^<BR>
  <BR>
  Don't be fooled by the forms folks.  This site is far from automated.  All the pages you 
  see up until about a hour ago where manually done with a pretty much normal text editor.  
  After about adding 7 new monks to the monks list and creating their personal data pages I 
  realised that doing it by hand would not cut it.  So thank god I am a programmer and I sat
  down for over an hour and wrote some utilies to take the form data and generate HTML code.
  Over the next couple of weeks you will see some format changes as I have already thought 
  of better ways to do things or have been shown the light by you my fellow monks.  Along
  the way I am going to try to pretty up the site too.  But I hope you agree that right now
  functionality is more important than polishing the site.<BR>
  <BR>
  By tomorrow night I expect to have the last 3 members of <FONT COLOR="#946828" FACE="CELTICMD, ARIAL" SIZE="+1">
    <B>T</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#946828" FACE="TIMES">he</FONT>
  <FONT COLOR="#946828" FACE="CELTICMD, ARIAL" SIZE="+1">
    <B>C</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#946828" FACE="TIMES">hapter</FONT> informed of their acceptance.  Depending on how 
	busy this place gets with petitions and how active the current members are there may be another 6 or so monks 
	asked to join our ranks.<BR>
	<BR>
	I have gotten some reports of bugs in the site.  I test every page with my IE 4.01 (I know I know) explorer and 
	they work....for this browser.  Netscape and other browsers may have a problem.  If any of you are using other 
	browsers can you please send me some <A HREF="Submission.html">feed back</A> to tell me:<BR>
	<OL>
	  <LI>What browser you are using.
	  <LI>What version of the browser is.
	  <LI>If you are having any problems.<BR>
	  and if you are
	  <LI>What problems you are having
	</OL>
	<BR>
	If you find errors with Explorer feel free to yell at me too.

	would like to welcome <A HREF="mailto:enigma@door.net">Enigma</a> to our ranks.<BR>
 
 Enigma has been a valueable contributer to the 
 mailing list.  His experiance as both a human monk and other races/classes throughout the beta and release period will prove
 most valueable to the aim of this site.<BR>
 On that note I make something very clear.  The Chapter is not a guild.  It is just a committee of monks to organise ideas to be
 placed on The Monastary for voting.  There will be a Guild called The Monastary but it will not preclude monks from voting as 
 it is a very seperate and small part of the overall site.<BR>

  I would like to welcome and thank Merilyn and Stonehand for aiding me with this site.<BR>
  Over the next few days we will be reviewing the other applicants to select an initial 4 members to join our ranks.
  Hopefully by monday all 4 new members will be selected and notified.<BR>
  Along with the selection process is the first petition we will be tackling.  I'll leak the topic to you now and you can look for the actual petition to be up by mid next week. 
  The topic for the first petition is the effect of stun to be added to our magical secondary attacks.<BR>
  I hope to get all 6 members input on the workings and balance issues before placing the petition up.<BR>
