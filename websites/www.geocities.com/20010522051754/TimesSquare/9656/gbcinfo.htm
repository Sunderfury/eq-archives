<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The Global Biomechanics Consortium, or GBC, is
a mega-conglomerated corporation comprised of a vast number of companies
and divisions dedicated to expanding the boundaries of genetic and biomechanic
technologies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">No doubt best known for the breakthrough lung
implant technology that halted the extermination of all mankind by the
Plague Wind, the new life GBC provided humanity has also been radically
improved by the development of bioroid technology, both for everyday and
military applications. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The GBC also consists of many other divisions,
however, many quite well-known in their own right. From names such as Gentech
Pharmaceuticals and Right Aerospace Technologies to the more everyday Sky
Breweries, the Global Biomechanics Consortium is dedicated to bringing
the world the best that human ingenuity has to offer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">As per the Second Corporate/Civil Security and
Control Act, the GBC is also very proud to claim uncontested governmental
control over this sector and many others like it. Citizens can depend on
the world-spanning resources at the disposal of the GBC to make their life
safe, secure, and comfortable. Boasting the largest private and contracted
security force in the world and a state-of-the-art intelligence network,
the GBC can safely proclaim civil unrest a thing of the past. Citizens
are now free to live a productive life under the protective wing of the
GBC. </FONT></P>
