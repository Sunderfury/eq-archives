<p><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">So, what does this all mean -
really?</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">You are, of course, free to
draw your own conclusions about the information presented here.
The bottom line of all this appears to be summed up in one word:
GROUP. Verant has stated from the beginning that this game was
not designed for soloing, but rather to promote socializing and
group play. The experience system, as it appears to work,
promotes this ideal not only by making soloing a difficult
activity ("looks like an even fight" - yeah, right,
hehe), but also by structuring experience in such a way that a
group of friends that adventures together on a regular basis <em>should
</em>level at approximately the same rate, thus allowing and even
encouraging us to form friendships/regular adventuring groups.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">Finally, if this information
has caught your interest (as it did mine), then I offer you three
more items to further your exploration and understanding of the
subject. The first is the Excel Spreadsheet that I first
developed, based on the sources I cited, which you can download
by clicking </font><a

size="3">. Secondly, you can </font><a

color="#FFFFFF" size="3">download</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF"
size="3"> the program I have written based on the spreadsheet. Finally, you are invited to discuss this information with other players in the forum that I have created </font><a

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3">I hope that you have enjoyed
reading this little editorial, of sorts. I know it's a long read,
but it's pretty interesting, and I hope that you will find the
information useful in your quest for more experience. </font></p>

<p><font color="#00FF00" size="4"><strong>Good luck!</strong></font></p>
