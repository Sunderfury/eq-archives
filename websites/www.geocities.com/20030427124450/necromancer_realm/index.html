	   <h4>
	   We picked up the newest patch message, some interesting changes going in as of this patch, these include
	   Everquest in a window(unfortunatly you can only run it one at a time, no multi-window EQ). The new Temporary
	   buff window has been implemented as well. The Broken Golem in Fear has been fixed, as well as a few other 
	   random bugs. The original and Velious interfaces have now been disabled for good as well. 
	   For the full patch message, click <a class="nav" href="patch.htm">here</a>

	   <h3>New Site Update</h3>

	   <h4>
	   Despite the current lack of news updates, we <i>are</i> diligently working on the new website. So far, we've got
	   the new spells section done, as well as the City guide. We're still looking for maps for some zones so that we 
	   can put them into the database too. We're working on getting the item database done, so that all you necromancers
	   out there can see what you are able to wear. **Note** The Quests section, and the Strategy section are both being
	   moved into the new forum. The reasoning for this is so that people can have discussions on the strategies, and
	   quests, and can ask questions of the submitters.

	   <h4>
	   Well, after a good bit of work, to get everything smoothed out, the Necromancer's Realm forum
	   is now open. You can view the forum by going here: <a class=nav href="http://www30.brinkster.com/necrorealm/forum/">Necromancer's Realm Forum</a>
	   or by clicking the updated link in the sidebar. This is the new home to the Necromancer's Realm
	   Forum, and it'll stay there. You must sign up for an account to post in the forum. It's free,
	   don't worry. I'll be going back and adding in some additional posts over the next couple of days,
	   so that some of the sections are better filled out. For now, Enjoy.

	   <h4>
	   Well, video clips from the upcoming Everquest 2 are up on the IGN website. They look
	   pretty cool, but they're being sponsored by the new nVidia graphics card the GeForce FX.
	   Looks like we'll have to make some serious upgrades if we wanna get into Everquest 2.

	   <h3>Website Update</h3>

	   <h4>
	   Just a small update on how the new site is coming. We're currently moving all of the strategies and
	   quests from their respective sections on the site, and from emails to the new forum, in their own
	   special sections, so that people are able to comment on the strategies, and offer suggestions to the
	   ones that are posted, as well as making it easier to post your own. We should have a link for the
	   new forum up by either tonight, or sometime midday tomorrow. Once the Forum is completed, we'll jump
	   headlong into finishing the new sections of the new site. Hopefully, within the next couple of weeks
	   we'll launch the new site. This is all dependant on our ever-popular webmaster, Me. So for now, please
	   continue submitting strategies, and quests, and maps. We've gotten only 3 maps since our post yesterday,
	   and are looking for many more. Just send 'em our way.

	   <h3>Calling All Cartographers</h3>

	   <h4>
	   We're going to be adding an expanded maps section in the new site, in order to make Necromancer's
	   Realm a sort of one-stop site for all your necromantic needs. As such,
	   we're looking for a few good mapmakers here at Necromancer's Realm. What we need from you guys,
	   is to submit to us your maps that you have accumulated through your playing experiences. Sadly,
	   as we operate a free site, and bandwith is an issue, we can't host them here, perhaps we'll find
	   a way to do it anyway, but until then, just send us the maps, and we'll try to get them linked
	   up or hosted here, or on the new site. Just send the links, or the maps themselves to Necromancer_Realm@hotmail.com
	   or Necromancer_Realm@yahoo.com.

	   bring it up in the new interface. Good news for us, Affliction Efficiency should now work on spells over level 61.

	   <h3>Long Overdue Update</h3>

	   <h4>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we apologize for the lack of content
	   and visual updates to this site, we're working hard on finishing
	   up the rest of the new site. We finished the Forum yesterday, and 
	   will have the link for it here by probably Sunday. We're still working
	   some bugs out of it. For those who were curious, yes, we're moving.
	   We've decided upon a nice cushy place over at www.brinkster.com. They're
	   free, and will allow us to have database support(which is a good thing). 
	   We'll attempt to keep you as updated as possible on the progress of the
	   new site, and will try to get in here and update the news while the new
	   site is getting put together. If you have any requsts for sections on
	   the site that you'd like to see, please, send us an Email. It's Necromancer_Realm@Yahoo.com.
	   or you can just click on my name at the bottom of this post. Again,
	   we apologize for taking so long. It just seems that putting a site
	   together that does what we want it to do, is a bit more of a daunting
	   task than we had imagined.<br>
	   <br>
	   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the new site is concerned, it's been
	   suggested that we integrate our necromancer information with information
	   from the Shadowknight classes. Well, we want your opinions about it. Would
	   having Shadowknights a part of the Necromancer's Realm be a good idea? One
	   of the most requested changes for the new site, is one full listing of spells,
	   instead of having them broken up. Wish granted there. Please help us make this
	   site the best necromancer site out there, comments, suggestions, compliments, 
	   complaints, all help us make a better site for all of you. Help out in the
	   best way you can, by sending us some feedback.
