The EQGD was established as a means for me to pass the time while awaiting the commercial release of EverQuest.  But now due to professional commitments and a busy schedule I can no longer provide the level of commitment required to manage this site adequately.<BR><BR>It was a lot of work but it was fun!  Thanks for your support and good luck with your EverQuest adventures.<BR><BR>
