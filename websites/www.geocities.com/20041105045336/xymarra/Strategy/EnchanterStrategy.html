This is a work in progress.  I wrote it down to be a central holding
place for my answers to all kinds of questions.  My own biases are
reflected within the advice contained herein, so be sure to check
other sources for other opinions.  I don't duel or play PvP and I
don't care for soloing, so neither of those is discussed much here.

<P>
Most of the advice contained herein is intended for a newer player.
At higher levels, game play changes, and some of your strategies will
change as well.  I will update this guide with information for level
60+ enchanters some day when I have time.

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=system>The System: How enchanters work in a group</A></H2>

The primary function of an enchanter in most situations is crowd
control.  The theory is that when the group is facing more than one
creature, the enchanter puts all but one of the creatures to sleep
with <A HREF=#slmez>mez</A> spells while the rest of the group kills
the single awake creature.  This is efficient because it keeps all
those other creatures from hitting the group while they kill the other
target.  At higher levels, it becomes a matter of survival rather than
efficiency since the group would not be able to withstand the assault
of the extra creatures.

<H3>Basic Assist Strategy</H3>

One person is designated <B>Puller</B> and is sent out to find
creatures to slay.  One person is designated target selecter and is
often the same as the puller.  That person is normally called <B>Main
Tank</B> or <B>Main Assist</B>.  The <B>/assist</B> command changes
your target to be the same as someone else's.  If you give the command
a name, as in "/assist Fred", then you will assist the person named
Fred.  If you don't give it a name, as in "/assist" with no arguments,
then it will assist your current target.  You can even use "/assist"
to assist monsters to find out who they are hitting, although this is
more useful for clerics than it is for us.  Everyone in the group
should create a hot key <A HREF=#socials>social</A> to assist the main
tank, optionally including a line or two saying what they are doing.

<P>
<DIV class=social>/assist MainTank</DIV>
<DIV class=gsay>/gsay Assisting our favorite tank in killing %T</DIV>
<P>
or
<P>
<DIV class=social>/target MainTank</DIV>
<DIV class=gsay>/gsay Assisting %T</DIV>
<DIV class=social>/assist</DIV>
<DIV class=gsay>/gsay Killing %T</DIV>

<P>
The puller goes out to get creatures and comes back with some.  

When the puller gets back to the group, the main tank chooses one
creature and announces it:

<P><DIV class=gsay>/gsay Everyone help me kill %T</DIV>

<P>At that point, everyone except you hits their assist macros and
starts pummeling the target of choice.  Then you, as the enchanter,
attempt to <A HREF=#target>target</A> each of the other creatures and cast your <A HREF=#slmez>mez</A> on
them.  When they are all mezzed, take a moment to survey your
handiwork.  If you didn't need to cast <A HREF=#sltash>Tash</A> to mez them, then Tash
them while they are mezzed.  <A HREF=#slslow>Slow</A> them while mezzed, unless there is a
shaman to cover that task.  

<H3>Improvements on the basic strategy</H3>

<P><B>Cast <A HREF=#slblur>memory blur</A> on your mezzed creatures</B> to keep them from eating you
when they wake up.  Mez spells include a memory blur component, but it
becomes less reliable when you confront higher level targets, so
additional blurring is desirable.  On raids, blur creatures mezzed by
other enchanters as well.

<P><B><A HREF=#slroot>Rooting</A> your mezzed creatures</B> also helps keep you alive.  If it
can't get to you it can't hurt you.  Some clerics will root things for
you without being asked.  If you have a ranger or paladin in your
group, ask them to snare or root everything before they wake it up.
Ranger roots do damage, so those can be cast to break the mez or after
the mez is broken.

<P><B>Use <A HREF=#slstun>stuns</A> to help you.</B>  Your point blank color stuns work very well
to buy you a bit of time to cast a mez.  You should always have one of
those memorized and you might find that you like to have two of them
because the recast times are long.  A common mez attempt sequence
against a tough creature looks like this:
<BR>Mez (resist)
<BR>Stun (no resists)
<BR>Mez (resist)
<BR>Stun (no resists)
<BR>Tash
<BR>Stun (no resists)
<BR>Mez (should be no resist with Tash)
<BR>Clerics and paladins can help you by stunning or rooting the thing
you are trying to mez or anything else that is beating on you.  Keep
your eyes open for those spell messages and suggest it to them if they
don't seem to be doing it.

<P><B>Time your mezzes.</B>  Figure out how long your mez lasts.  It will
always have the same duration unless it is broken by damage or
dispel.  When you cast a mez, time it either with the /time command,
an egg timer, a wall clock or counting "one-thousand one one-thousand
two ...".  Before the mez is about to run out, recast it.  If the
creature never wakes up, you will never get hit.  You are usually
better off refreshing a mez 2/3 of the way through its duration than
you are waiting until it hits you.

<P><B>Use auto-target to mez quickly on pulls.</B> If your puller is
very friendly and clever, they can let you pick the current target on
a pull.  Targetting one out of a number of creatures in a pull can be
very hard.   (See the section on <A HREF=#target>Targetting</A>.)
As they run to camp with a bunch of bad guys, you use your Target
Nearest NPC button and mez whatever you get.  The puller clears their
target, selects whatever hits them, then calls the rest of the group
to assist.  That knocks out one targetting task out, leaving the rest
of your job a little easier.

<P><B>Choose the next target.</B>  You know which of your sleepers is closest
to breaking mez, which has been Tashed and slowed, which is most
likely to resist you when you try to refresh, so you choose who dies
next.  Make yourself a nice hotkey that says "Kill %T next" and use it
whenever you have more than one thing mezzed.  If you don't care then
just say "Pick any of them" so the tank knows they don't have to wait
for your selection.

<P><B>Learn how to avoid interruption.</B> One of the most frustrating
things that can happen is being continually interrupted until
everything wakes up and your group dies.  Two factors affect
interrupts: damage taken and total distance moved.  <A
HREF=#slrunes>Rune and Berserk</A> spells will help prevent interrupts
due to damage taken.  Most of the time, however, creatures interrupt
your spell casting by pushing you around.  If a creature pushes you
backwards, try to take a tiny step forward to counter the motion.  If
many creatures are hitting you at once, try spinning in place; this
sends constant motion requests to the server and helps maintain your
position.

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=role>Raid Roles</A></H2>

<EM>Always listen to your raid leader!</EM>  They should tell you what
you need to do, where you need to stand, and what the overall
situation will be.  This section describes those things which will
most commonly be asked of you.
<P>
Raids are about the only time you will work with another enchanter.
It's a good idea to talk to the other enchanters on the raid so that
you can coordinate your efforts.  If you are all trying to do the same
thing at the same time, you will waste a lot of mana and cause a great
deal of frustration as you overwrite each others spells and miss
targets.
<P>
Most of the advice in this section is intended for people attending
their first large scale raids, like Hate and Fear.  Some things will
change as you gain higher levels; most importantly, your resist rates
will go down a lot, so you will be able to try trickier things.


<H3>Crowd Control</H3>

On many raids, your role will be much the same as in a single group.
Your job in Hate or Fear, for example, is to keep all but one of the
creatures mezzed while the raid kills the one awake thing.  One main
difference is that it's usually a lot harder to mez the creatures you
encounter on raids, because they are higher level and more resistant
than the creatures you encounter in most of your hunting.
<P>
You may need to <A HREF=#sltash>Tash</A> most creatures to make your
mez stick.  If you see another enchanter having difficulty with a mez,
try Tashing the creature.  If it stays on them, mez it.  If it charges
over to you, they can mez it.  If it is too hard for you to mez it,
Tash it again or cast a <A HREF=#slblur>memory blur</A> to make it
turn from its target.
<P>
In order to keep a raid moving quickly, the main tank may not taunt
creatures very much before breaking mez.  It's very handy to cast <A
HREF=#slblur>memory blur</A> on every mezzed creature.  This is a very
useful, if not glamorous, role for an enchanter who is not really high
enough level to land mezzes.  Neither taunt nor memory blur is 100%
reliable, but both help.

<H3>Raid Socials</H3>

You will want some special <A HREF=#socials>socials</A> to use on
raids.  For the first hour of the raid, announce almost everything
you do.  Make a macro for Tash, root, dispel, sieve, and every other
spell you might want to cast.  When you cast a spell that you think is
important, announce it to the raid.  It is important to announce
dispels because they take out debuffs.  It is important to announce
root because it affects aggro; a rooted monster almost always attacks
its closest opponent, rather than the one that has generated the most
hate.  Announcing the name of the thing you are currently trying to
mez helps the other enchanters when there are lots of things to be
mezzed at once.
<P>
<DIV class=say>/say I am trying to mez &lt;( %T )&gt.</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class=ooc>/ooc &lt;( %T )&gt; is MEZZED - Don't wake %O up !</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class=ooc>/ooc &lt;( %T )&gt; is TASHED!</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class=ooc>/ooc &lt;( %T )&gt; is DISPELLED!</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class=ooc>/ooc &lt;( %T )&gt; is ROOTED to the ground!</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class=shout>/shout &lt;( %T )&gt; CANNOT BE MEZZED - Please tank %O !</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class=shout>/y</DIV>
<DIV class=emote>/panic say is DYING!</DIV>

<P>
If your raid is using a special chat channel, you may wish to rewrite
your socials to announce things in that channel.  It is probably easier
to write one set of socials for a specific channel than to edit all of
your socials for each raid.  You may have to /join and /leave channels
to make the raid channel show up at the appropriate number for your
socials.

<H3>Runing</H3>

Some creatures have particularly nasty <B>proc</B> effects.  These are
special attacks that are randomly activated with the creature hits
something.  Venril Sathir, for example, procs a giant life tap, which
steals health from his opponent and heals him.  One strategy for
avoiding such attacks involves our <A HREF=#slrunes>Rune</A> line of
spells.  If the creature's attack is completely absorbed by a Rune, it
is considered a miss and the proc will not go off.
<P>
Basically, you get all of the enchanters present to cast their best
Rune as fast as possible on the main tank until the foe is dead.
Depending on the situation, you may need to cast a Rune on every tank,
just in case the creature turns and hits them or ripostes.
<P>
If at all possible, have your main tank forego any strength buffs so
that you can use the Berserk line as well.  The damage absorption will
deplete one spell at a time, so if you can use one spell from each
line, you have a much better chance of preventing damage from getting
through.
<P>
This technique is expensive to use, because of the 10pp cost of
peridots.  Rune is also a very high aggro spell, generating a lot more
hate for you than would be generated by a heal for the same amount of
damage.  For these reasons, it is not normally advisable to Rune in
every fight.  Leave the healing to the healers except when the special
properties of Rune are required.

<H3>Debuffing</H3>

Our major debuff spell is <A HREF=#sltash>Tash</A>, which lowers magic
resistance.  Once Tash is cast, all other casters will have a much
easier time landing their magic-based spells.  However, it also
generates a huge amount of aggro.  When taking on a single mighty
opponent, it is sometimes best to cast the Tash immediately and accept
your death (we call this tashicide).  If you will need to stick around
for Runes or Sieves, then wait a bit longer for the main tank to build
up some hate, and you may survive.  Through trial and error, you will
learn how long you have to wait.
<P>
Normally shamans will take care of <A HREF=#slslow>slowing</A>
creatures, but you should be ready to step in when there are no
shamans present, when they are being resisted, or when they are dead.
Forlorn Deeds is nearly as effective as the best shaman slows,
reducing attack rate by 70% compared with the shaman's 75%.
<P>
It is useful to cast <A HREF=#sldebuffs>Cripple</A> on creatures that
can Rampage or have other special mel&eacute;e effects.  Cripple
lowers the creatures Agility and Dexterity, which makes it less likely
to get its special combat abilities.  Be careful when casting Cripple,
since it generates a very large amount of aggro.  Shamans can cast
this spell as well.

<H3>Mana Sieve</H3>

Mana sieve is most important when fighting healers.  If a dragon casts
Complete Heal on itself during a battle, that battle is most likely
lost.  Stuns will not interrupt casters over level 55 or giants of any
level, so <A HREF=#casters>mana deprivation</A> is our only really
viable technique.  Some creatures can be pushed around by the
mel&eacute;e fighters, causing all spells to be interrupted, but sieve
can be more reliable.  <A HREF=#slmana>Mana stealing spells</A> generate
very little aggro, so you should be able to start stealing mana early
in the fight without being slain instantly.

<H3>Charming</H3>

Most of the time, you will not want to charm things on raids.  Your
lone pet will do so little damage compared to all the fighters and you
will take so much damage when it goes wild, that it is simply not
efficient.  There is also a risk if the raid is nearly wiped out and
your pet goes wild near the end, that it can steal the kill and cause
the body to vanish.
<P>
Charm is a useful tool for controlling adds that cannot be mezzed.  It
is particularly useful when you have an unmezzable healer prolonging a
battle.  The other normal solution to that problem is to put a fighter
on the add to keep it busy while the main battle is completed.  If the
creature can be charmed by a bard, it's probably better to let the
bard do it.  It is much easier for a bard to recover a broken charm
than it is for an enchanter.  Our advantage over bards lies in the
range of creatures we can charm.
<P>
When you have Dictate or Dire Charm, charming becomes a much more
interesting option on raids.

<H3>Aggro Control</H3>

With Luclin, we gained the <A HREF=#slvisage>Visage</A> line of
spells.  These spells can be cast on others to raise or lower the hate
generated by their actions by 5% or 10%.  Casting your best
aggro-increaser on the main tank just as he engages a creature can
help him maintain control in the battle.  It takes two enchanters to
maintain an aggro increaser on a single fighter.

<H3>Dispel Protection</H3>

When fighting dispelling creatures, it can be useful to cast your
cheaper group buffs on the raiders.  If you have your epic, you can
chain-cast haste on the main tank to increase damage output and help him
maintain aggro.  Group Resist Magic and Boon of the Clear Mind are
nice inexpensive spells that are good to have on and will help protect
other buffs from dispels.

<H3>Other Tips</H3>

You will most likely <B>not</B> want to use your area effect spells on
your first raids.  If creatures are resisting your mez, a <A
HREF=#slstun>color stun</A> will probably be resisted by everything
and you will be slain very quickly.  Also, in the plane of Hate, area
effect spells tend to invite instant death from above.
<P>
If the raid is
using an <A HREF=#ae>area effect</A> strategy, then your strategy will
be the same as for a single AE group.
<P>
You will die on raids.  You will die a lot.  Try not to let it bother you.

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=charm>Charm</A></H2>

Charm is a very powerful tool, but it's also a way to get yourself
dead really fast.  It can pull you through an otherwise hopeless
situation, but it can also turn a tight spot into a disaster.  Most of
the time in a normal group, you are better off letting the tanks kill
things and using <A HREF=#slmez>mez</A> to control adds.  Charming has
the nice side effect of increasing damage output of the group or raid.

I use charm in a few situations:
<UL>
<LI>To control a creature that cannot be mezzed, particularly
casters.  Giant class creatures cannot be stunned, which includes mez,
but they can be rooted, tanked or charmed.  Charming is an appealing
option here because it prevents the creature from healing its allies.
<LI>To help damage output in an anemic group.  When your group
consists of a paladin, a cleric and an enchanter, you might find that
charming adds speeds things up considerably.  It helps if the group is
very strong on healing, since it doesn't really speed things up if you
have to wait forever on healer mana between kills because your wayward
former pets chewed you up.
<LI>To solo.  Charmed pets can be far more effective than our wimpy
animations.  Don't try this without Spirit of Wolf though.
</UL>

<P>
Be careful when using charm against precious targets.  If your charmed
pet goes wild at the wrong time, it can get the kill as an NPC and
cause the body to poof.  If the body of some rare and mighty beast
vanishes due to your use of a pet, you will feel really bad.

<H3>Casting Charm</H3>

High <A HREF=#slcharisma>Charisma</A> helps your charm last longer, as
does <A HREF=#sltash>Tash</A>.
So, if you are going to be charming, you should have your charisma buffs
on.  The effect of charisma is very slight, so I would not give up HP
or mana gear to put on +CHA gear when charming.
<P>
You also want to try to Tash the creature before you charm it.
To keep it from beating on you while you do this, try mezzing with a
24 second mez or rooting it.
<P>
Lower level charm spells are generally cheaper and faster to cast.
The only major difference between them is the level cap on the
targets.  Charm goes up to level 25,  Beguile goes up to 35, etc..
Try to use the lowest level charm spell that will work on your target.
At very high levels, the charms become shorter and less resistable, up
to the level 60, unresistable, 48 second Dictate.
<P>
When your pet goes wild, try to mez it with a short mez before you
recharm.  This gives you an opportunity to refresh your Tash and
collect your wits.

<H3>Breaking Charm</H3>

Warn your group before you break your charm.
<P>
There are two ways to break charm: Invisibility or Dispel.  If you have
buffed your charmed pet, you should probably break charm with a huge
dispel to take off the buffs.  If you charmed a pet that had been
debuffed, then you probably want to use invisibility to break the charm.
Unfortunately, your charmed pet cannot be debuffed before you break 
the charm.
<P>
If you have an item that casts Invisibility or Dispel or if you have
the innate Hide ability, you should use that to break the charm.
Then you don't have to wait for your spell icons to refresh and you
can react immediately to your now wild pet.

<H3>Charm Socials</H3>

I have a whole panel of <A HREF=#socials>macros</A> for use when charming.  It's not too
hard to type out commands like "/pet back off", but hitting a button
is still faster.

<P><B>Attempting to charm %M</B> - Charm is the one class of spells
that is actually important to announce.  People can get bent out of
shape when their spells suddenly stop taking effect or their weapons
stop swinging.  So give people warning when you try it.

<P><B>I have charmed %M</B> - I usually include a "/pet who is leader"
in this social.  When the monsters say, "My leader is Xymarra",
everyone takes notice.

<P><B>/pet back off</B> - This command clears your pet's aggro
list.  You should probably hit it immediately after you charm the
creature.  This will prevent your pet from running over and whacking
on people while charmed or from running off to slay perceived foes in
random places in the dungeon.

<P><B>/pet guard here</B> - Your pet will follow you around unless you
explicitly tell it not to.  I like to have my pet guard some distance
away from me so that I will have some warning when it breaks charm.

<P><B>/pet follow me</B> - It may or may not be worth putting this on
a macro.  You use it to put your pet back in follow mode when you are
ready to move elsewhere.

<P><B>/pet kill</B> - Send your pet in to kill your current target.  I
like to keep an /assist macro on the same page as my pet commands so
that I can have my pet help on the correct target.  Again, I put a
"/pet who is leader" in this command so that people don't panic when
it comes running into battle.

<P><B>My pet has gone wild!</B> - Make this one loud and bright.  When
your pet goes wild, you are probably going to die fast, especially if
you were so bold as to buff it.

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=casters>Stopping Caster Creatures</A></H2>

Creatures that heal or gate can really ruin your day.  You can
identify casting creatures immediately with Theft of Thought.
Otherwise you may need to wait until they try to cast something.  Some
creatures appear to "cast" spells when they proc special effects but
have no mana to drain and cannot be interrupted, such as life-tapping
wraiths.

<H3>Stuns</H3>

Point blank AE color stuns are a very good tool in most situations.
You should probably keep one memorized at all times on general
principles.

<P>Chain casting color stuns is a good way to keep a monster
from even thinking about casting, or doing much of anything else for
that matter.  This is a useful strategy in several situations and some
enchanters use it in every fight everywere.  However, it is a bit
wasteful of mana and can bring you unwanted aggro.  Not to mention
that it's really tedious; if we wanted to be tapping keys
continuously, we would be playing bards.

<P>Alternatively, you can wait for the casting message and stun to
interrupt it.   This is not quite as effective at preventing casting
or damage, but it brings less aggro on you, takes less mana, and
allows you to do other things during combat.

<P>Our direct damage spells have an instantaneous stun component which
has no purpose other than interrupting spells.  We pay for this effect
with a high resist rate and increased taunt value for the spells.  I
often keep the level 8 Chaotic Feedback spell memorized when I will be
confronting stunnable casters.

<P>Lagarn's Lamentation has a real stun effect (8 second duration) and
is single target, so it can be used in many situations where color
stuns cannot, but it is expensive to cast and has a long refresh time
(24 seconds), so it would have to be used in conjunction with other
spells to prevent casting.

<H3>Mana Deprivation</H3>

<P>Some creatures cannot be interrupted with stuns.  Unstunnable
giants and level 60 monsters are the main examples.  They can be
interrupted if you actually knock them back, but this is difficult to
do and impossible for you as an enchanter.

<P>Sometimes the creature will do this for you by casting itself nearly
oom.  Then you can steal the end of its mana with a single timely
<A HREF=#slmana>Theft of Thought</A> or <A HREF=#slmana>Mana Sieve</A>.

<P>For creatures that are not that obliging, you will have to drain
away all of their mana.  After the initial probing Theft of Thought to
refresh yourself and identify the target as a caster, begin casting
Mana Sieve.  If the monster dies too fast, you may not be able to
steal all of its mana in time, so you may need to ask that certain
kills be slowed down to prevent gaters.

<P>
<A HREF=#slmana>Torment of Argli</A> is very effective at stopping
casters, because it continues to drain mana over its duration, which
prevents the creature from regenerating more mana.  I find that one
cast of that and one or two casts of Theft of Thought often render a
creature completely incapable of spell casting.


<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=target>Targetting</A></H2>

<P>When your puller shows up with three or four creatures, you will
need to put all of the extras to sleep.  You have a number of options
for accomplishing this task.

<P>The easiest choice is to use an area effect mez: Mesmerization or
Fascination.  Mesmerization is a very efficient spell.  It only keeps
the creatures down for 24 seconds, but it can affect up to 5 creatures
at a time and it is quite inexpensive.  The downsides are that you can
mez yourself accidentally, it is annoyingly ineffective when you have
more than 5 targets, there are places where you cannot use AE, and you
generate a lot of aggro.  If you try it on creatures close to or above
your level, you will almost certainly get resists and die very
quickly.  Some enchanters like to use AE mez to lock down a pull of
3-5 and then root the creatures so that they can be moved over to
single target mez as they awaken.

<P>If AE mez is normally partially effective, or if you get more than
five things to mez at once, try casting AE mez and then hitting Escape
to clear your target.  The next thing that hits you will make itself
your target and you will be able to mez it.

<P>The auto-target commands are very useful for selecting creatures.
Selection with the mouse is tedious.  EQ often freezes up the mouse
cursor or moves it to strange places, so unless you are using it
constantly, you'll have to find your cursor before you can use it to
select.  The "Target Nearest NPC" command ignores players and pets,
automatically selecting only NPCs.  You should bind that to a nice
handy key instead of the default F8.  I use "x".

<P>If auto-target doesn't give you a creature you can mez, then try
moving around to get a different target.  Alternatively, you can
switch through various camera positions to quickly get different
angles on the battle and see if any of those give you something
better.  I generally set up my third person camera views to get useful
angles on the battlefield if we are going to be sitting in one spot
for a while.

<P>If the creatures are all standing right on top of each other, try
standing behind the main tank and using auto-target from there.  The
fighter's target is probably going to be pushed backwards by the force
of his sword blows, leaving mezzable targets closer to you.

<P>A considerate tank will move the fight after you mez something.
All of the awake creatures should follow the tank, allowing you to
separate them from the sleepers.

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=ae>Area Effect Tactics</A></H2>

Some fights are more easily won with magic than with brawn.
The most efficient damage spells are area effect spells, particularly
point blank area effect spells.
Regular area effect spells can only hit four or five targets, but
point blank area spells, which radiate out from the caster, can effect
an unlimited number of targets.
Wizards, magicians, druids and clerics have damaging point blank AE spells.
Bards have point blank AE damage over time songs.
Enchanters have point blank AE stuns.

<P>
In an AE battle, your role is to use the <A HREF=#slstun>Color
Stuns</A> to keep everything immobile while the rest of the group
kills them.  Color Flux lasts four seconds.  Color Shift lasts six
seconds.  Color Skew and Color Slant last eight seconds.  You will
probably want to keep three stuns memorized and cycle them as fast as
possible.  You may want to keep all four stuns ready, since the longer
ones are generally more effective but the short cast time on Color
Flux makes it useful for regaining control after resists.  The other
casters should stand close by you so that their AE spells cover all
the targets and so that they don't pull creatures out of the radius of
your stuns when they get aggro.

<P>
On raids, you may wish to tackle certain areas with AE and others with
the more traditional main tank and mezzed adds.  Make sure everyone
knows which battles will be fought with AE and which will be fought
traditionally.  An AE spell on top of your crowd of mezzed creatures
can spell disaster.

<P>
In single group AE hunting, your group will generally be killing
everything with AE blasts.  An AE group generally consists of: one
cleric, one enchanter, one puller, and three AE casters.  Wizards make
the best AE casters, but druids and magicians are quite respectable.
Any class that can get back to the group with fifteen or more
creatures in tow makes a good puller.  Bards are often favored because
they can contribute to the AE damage output.  The puller is often left
to mel&eacute;e down the last creature standing while everyone else
meditates.

<P>
If the group is making very large pulls (40-50 creatures), you will
want a second, or even a third, enchanter in the group.  With only one enchanter on so
many opponents, you are almost certain to get a couple of resists on
every cast.  Then you get interrupted and the whole thing falls apart.

<P>
Rumor has it that when you take on Ogre form, you cannot be stunned
from the front.  This would be very useful in AE situations, but it
has never been shown to be true for certain.

<P>
There will be deaths when things don't go quite right, but even with
the deaths, AE fighting is probably the fastest way to gain
experience.


<P><HR> <H2><A NAME=buffs>Group Buffing</A></H2>

The order of importance of your mana expenditures is:
<B>
<OL>
<LI>Crowd control.
<LI>Buffing.
<LI>Damage dealing.
</OL>
</B>

Don't let yourself get so low on mana from buffing that you can't do
your job controlling crowds.  Don't consider doing damage unless the
crowds are under control, everyone has their buffs up, and you are
over 80% mana.  Nuking is a luxury that you can rarely afford.
The only buff you should consider casting when you are really close to
OOM (Out Of Mana) is <A HREF=#slclarity>Clarity</A>.  Group Clarity,
aka Boon of the Clear Mind, can be used to quickly restore Clarity on
the whole group if you don't have the mana or time to cast Clarity 2
on everyone.
<P>
In the following, I use these words to describe groups of classes:
<LIST>
<LI><B>Mages</B> (INT Casters) = Enchanter, Wizard, Magician, Necromancer
<LI><B>Healers</B> (WIS Casters) = Cleric, Druid, Shaman
<LI><B>Casters</B> (People who primarily cast spells) = Mages + Healers
<LI><B>Hybrids</B> (People who cast spells and swing weapons) = Ranger, Paladin, Shadowknight, Beastlord
<LI><B>Fighters</B> (People who primarily swing weapons) =
Warrior, Monk, Rogue, Bard + Hybrids
</LIST>
<P>
Normally, you shouldn't have too much trouble keeping a basic set of
buffs on everyone.  This includes (ignoring spells beyond your level):
<UL>
<LI><A HREF=#slclarity><B>Clarity</B></A> on casters and hybrids.
<LI><A HREF=#slclarity><B>Gift of Insight/Brilliance</B></A> on casters, if you can afford it.
<LI><A HREF=#slclarity><B>Insight/Brilliance/Enlightenment</B></A> on casters and hybrids whose mana
stat is below 190.
<LI><A HREF=#slcharisma><B>Charisma buff</B></A> on yourself and anyone else who is casting mind spells (bards,
druids, necromancers), if they wish it.
<LI><A HREF=#slhaste><B>Haste</B></A> on fighters.  Use the best one you can afford. (This can eat most of
your mana, so you may have to economize.)
<LI><A HREF=#slarmor><B>Shielding</B></A>, self only spell.
<LI><A HREF=#slarmor><B>AC buff</B></A> on mages.  Cast this on everyone if you don't have a
cleric.
<LI><A HREF=#slresist><B>Resist Magic</B></A>.  Cast this on yourself to keep from getting caught
in AE mez.  Cast on the puller to protect them from root, snare and
fear.  Cast on everyone if it is relevant and you can afford it.
</UL>
Use the best spell you have in each line.  You may need to drop back
on the haste spells if you are too low on mana or if low stamina is an
issue.  For example, at level 24, I found that I could keep Alacrity on two people
and still do crowd control, or keep Alacrity on three people and do
nothing else.
<P>
You should expect to get some basic buffs from other casters in your
group.

<H3>Cleric</H3>

<UL>
<LI> <B>Symbol</B> -  You should always get a symbol, probably their best one,
if you are doing any crowd control.
<LI> <B>HP Buff</B> -  You should always get the best HP buff they can
cast.
<LI> <B>Death Pact</B> - In very treacherous areas and on very hard
breaks, Death Pact can save you.  The effect of the spell is a chance
of a 1000 point heal at the moment of death.  The chance is based on
your charisma, which should be fairly high.  The spell consumes a
pearl, but if you provide the pearls your cleric will probably be
happy to cast it on you.
</UL>

Don't bother the cleric for an AC buff.  Yours is almost as good and
costs a lot less mana.  You can offer to cast your <A HREF=#slarmor>AC
buff</A> on everyone if the cleric's mana is tight.  It should never
be the case that your mana is tight and the cleric's is not.  If you
get in that situation, stop slowing things and the balance will tilt
back.

<H3>Shaman</H3>

<UL>
<LI> <B>Spirit of Wolf</B> - If you are outside and flight is an
option, you should have Spirit of Wolf on.
<LI> <B>Regeneration</B> - The small healing spells that clerics and
others have to use on you are very inefficient.  If you are getting
hit often, you should have a regeneration spell to keep you at full
between battles.  Keeping regeneration up is mana-intensive and
tedious, so only ask for it when it is necessary. 
<LI> <B>Poison and Disease Resist</B> - You should rarely need these,
but ask for them when you do.  Clerics, Druids and some others can
also cast them.
</UL>

If you need the magic resistance from your <A
HREF=#slarmor>Shielding</A> spell, don't let the shaman cast Talisman on you.  
If you are not facing any casting creatures and you are not using <A
HREF=#slmez>AE mez</A> spells, you may not care about the lost magic
resistance.  Your Shielding spell also gives you some armor, which you
may or may not deem significant, depending on the situation.
Having more armor can reduce the amount of damage you take in
mel&eacute;e, which can in turn help you channel spells, but this
damage mitigation is not comparable to the extra hit points you will
get from the Talisman.
<P>
Also, if your buff box is getting full, ask them to refrain from
casting stat buffs on you.  They don't help much and are worse than
useless if they displace necessary buffs.  You can cancel unwanted
buffs by clicking on them.  The only stat buff that is really
useful for an enchanter is Stamina.

<H3>Druid</H3>

<UL>
<LI> <B>Spirit of Wolf</B> - If you are outside and flight is an
option, you should have Spirit of Wolf on.
<LI> <B>Regeneration</B> - Same reason as for shamans.  At higher
levels, druids get group regeneration spells, so those should always
be up.
<LI> <B>Fire and Cold Resist</B> - You should rarely need these,
but ask for them when you do.  Clerics, Shamans and some others can
also cast them.
<LI> <B>HP Buff</B> - The druid Skin like *** and Protection of ***
lines add to your total HP.  If there is no cleric present, you should
get the druid's best HP buff.  At higher levels, these spells add
regeneration and, at level 60, mana regeneration, so you may prefer
them over the cleric buffs in some circumstances.
</UL>

Try not to get damage shields if you can avoid it.  Sometimes monsters
are still swinging when you mez them and that small damage can break
your mez.  Like other unwanted buffs, you can cancel the damage shield.

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=raid>Raid Buffing</A></H2>

Often a raid will have fewer enchanters than there are groups.  If you
are the only enchanter for three or more groups, you will have to make
an assessment of which buffs to cast and which not to cast.  
<P>
It is important to keep <A HREF=#slclarity>Clarity</A> on the
clerics, the main healers for each group, and the main slower.  If you
have someone pulling with spells, they should have Clarity as well.
<P>
You will want to keep your best <A HREF=#slhaste>Haste</A> on the main
tank and on any high level Monks and Rogues who aren't off pulling all
the time.  If you are in an underwater zone, then Augmentation is
useful to keep everyone's stamina up.
Use a lower haste that has a longer duration on all the lesser tanks,
if mana permits.
<P>
On most raids, you should also cast <A HREF=#slresist>Group Resist
Magic</A> on everyone.  This spell gives more resistance than regular
Resist Magic, and it is very efficient in terms of mana.
<P>
If there are multiple enchanters on the raid, you may want to split
duties by groups or by spell.  I generally prefer to split by spell,
since then I can keep my most requested buff memorized.  I find it
useful to write down a list of names for each buff I need to cast.
Usually, I generate this list by running through all the appropriate
classes and typing:
<DIV class=social>
/who class
</DIV>
For example, when building a list of people who need haste, I type
<DIV class=social>
/who war <BR>
/who monk <BR>
/who rog <BR>
/who pal <BR>
/who ran <BR>
/who shad <BR>
/who bard
</DIV>
and write down the names for each class.  You have to warn people to
turn off anonymity first, but people should know that they need to
turn off anon if they want buffs.
<P>
With the addition of the new <B>/targetgroupbuff</B> command (which
can be abbreviated /targetg or /tgb), it is now quite easy to keep
group buffs on a whole raid.  This command toggles your current state
of buffing other groups.  When it is on and you cast a group buff,
your buff affects all members of your current target's group and
yourself.  If your target is not a player character, then the spell
affects your own group as usual.  Every time you zone, this toggle is
reset to OFF, so remember to type /tgb before you start your buffing
ritual.  Because you are affected when you cast spells this way, it is
not possible to time your group buffs by casting them on yourself.
Either someone will have to let you know when the spell is wearing
off, or you will need a timer for it.

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=tips>Other Useful Tips</A></H2>

<P><B>Ducking while casting cancels the spell.</B>  Due to a recent
change, ducking now immediately cancels your current spell cast.  If
you find yourself in the middle of a long cast, you can rapidly hit
your duck key twice and be ready to cast another spell or sit down to
meditate. 

<P><B>Enchanter healing is Rune and Berserk.</B> We don't get any
healing spells, but we do get damage absorbing shields.  Both the Rune
and Berserk spells absorb a fixed amount of damage before falling.

<P><I>Obsolete: <B>After level 35, you don't need to stare at your
spell book to meditate.</B>
<BR></I> Now, <B>nobody has to stare at a spell book
to meditate</B>.  Once you have trained the Meditation skill at level
4, you will automatically meditate when you sit down.

<H3>Using Tash</H3>

The <A HREF=#sltash>Tash</A> line of spells reduce magic resistance.
Every line of spells we have is magic-based, except for Tash itself,
so this helps us stick all our spells.  However, Tash generates a huge
amount of aggro when you cast it.

<P>
Normally, I do not cast Tash before mezzing.  That gets the monster so
mad at you that it will come over and beat on you, preventing you from
casting the mez.  Once you have been resisted once, the monster is
probably beating on you already, so you might as well Tash it while
mez refreshes.

<P>
I also don't normally Tash before <A HREF=#slslow>slowing</A>.
Enchanter slows are less resistable than shaman slows, so I rarely
need it.  If there is a shaman in your group, you should Tash fairly
quickly in every fight so that the shaman can cast their slow spell.
Make sure the shaman knows that you will be Tashing right away, since
some of them are skittish about getting hit.  Your Tash is a fast
enough spell that you can cast it when you see the shaman start to
cast their slow.  That way you take at most one hit from the monster
before the shaman's slow spell takes hold.

<P>
When you are fighting some really nasty creature that takes 30 people
to kill, someone will have to Tash it, unless it is completely immune
to magic.  That person will probably die, so figure out who is going
to take the Tash death <I>before</I> the battle starts.  Also, the
battle is likely to occur wherever that enchanter was standing, so
make sure you are positioned properly when you cast.

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=socials>Socials (Macros)</A></H2>

<P>
The point of socials is to let your group or your raid know what you
are up to.  If they know what is mezzed, Tashed and slowed or what is
giving you trouble, they can act appropriately.  It is your
responsibility to give them the information they need to make
everything work smoothly.
You can also use socials to automate commands that you want to use 
repeatedly, such as /loc or /corpse.  Anything you can type in your chat line can be placed in a macro for easy repetition.

<P>
You create a social by clicking on the Socials button in your main
window.  Right click any of the buttons in that menu to edit its
contents.  There are ten pages of socials, so you should have plenty
of room to make more.  Edit the name at the top of the dialog box and
then edit the five lines of the social.  Hitting Escape leaves the
dialog without saving your changes.  When you are happy with your
social, press Done.  Left click and hold the new social button to pick it
up.  A square button will appear on your cursor.  Drag it to your hot
box and drop it in one of the slots.  Now you can activate your social
by pressing the number key asssociated with that slot.

<H3>Casting Spells in a Social</H3>

Spells can be attached directly to socials with the /cast 1-8 command.
However, I don't like attaching socials to spells in that fashion.  It
makes sense for a cleric to use a dedicated social for Complete Heal,
but most enchanter spells would simply generate too much spam.
I use socials for a lot of spells, but I hit them separately.
It is usually more important to inform your group
about what spells have landed than about what spells you are trying to
cast. Also, if I don't announce every time I sneeze, people listen
better to what I do announce.

<P>
I found that when I did try to cast spells through a social, the spam
was really annoying.  I had to keep mashing the key waiting for a
refresh, which repeated the spell message each time.  Some people get
around this by making their macro cast the spell multiple times:

<DIV class=gsay>/gsay I am casting my favorite wifty spell!</DIV>
<DIV class=social>/pause 1, /cast 1
<BR>/pause 1, /cast 1
<BR>/pause 1, /cast 1
<BR>/pause 1, /cast 1</DIV>

That way you can hit your macro when you think your spell is about to
refresh and still get it to go off as soon as possible without
spamming your group.
You will still spam yourself, though.

<H3>Variables</H3>

When creating a macro, instead of including the word "it" or saying
"this thing here", you can use variables that depend on your target to
describe it.
<UL>
<LI><B>%T</B> - Target's name
<LI><B>%S</B> - Subject pronoun (he/she/it)
<LI><B>%O</B> - Object pronoun (him/her/it)
<LI><B>%P</B> - Possessive pronoun (his/her/its)
<LI><B>%R</B> - Target's race
<LI><B>%M</B> - Your pet's name
</UL>
For example, you can create a command to designate a target such as:
<DIV class=gsay>/gsay %T deserves death, help me kill %O!</DIV>
and, depending on what you are pointing at, the group will see
<DIV class=gsay>/gsay Xymarra deserves death, help me kill her!</DIV>
<DIV class=gsay>/gsay a sarnak janissary deserves death, help me kill
it!</DIV>
Unfortunately, the macros will not automatically capitalize the first
letter of a sentence, so I try to put the %T somewhere in the middle.
<P>
You can attach an arbitrary statement to an animated emote by adding
the word "say" after the emote command.  For example:
<DIV class=emote>/frown say is annoyed at %T for resisting her
mez.</DIV>
results in me performing the frown emote and everyone sees:
<DIV class=emote>Xymarra is annoyed at a sarnak janissary for resisting her mez.</DIV>

<H3>Examples</H3>

These are short paraphrased versions of the socials I use.  The actual
socials are generally complete sentences with key words in ALL CAPS
and creature names surrounded by decorative punctuation.  I use a
combination of emotes, /say, /gsay, /ooc and /shout, depending on the
situation.  Most raid messages are in /ooc with only disasters in
/shout.  I have group and raid versions of most of my socials.

<P>
Examples of my actual socials:
<P>
<DIV class=gsay>/gsay Please kill &lt;( %T )&gt; next.</DIV>
<DIV class=emote>/point say would like you to kill %T next.</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class=emote>/e has mezzed %T.</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class=ooc>/ooc &lt;( %T )&gt; is MEZZED - Don't wake %O up !</DIV>
<P>
<DIV class=shout>/shout &lt;( %T )&gt; CANNOT BE MEZZED - Please tank %O !</DIV>

<P>
I generally prefer to use common words for effects rather than spell
names.  Most people don't know or care whether I am using Dazzle,
Entrance or Mesmerize to control creatures, but everyone knows what
"mez" is.  Similarly, if I shout that a creature has been "Recanted",
I won't get the immediate recognition that I would see if I used the
word "Dispelled" instead.

<P>
<B>Attempting to mez</B> - I generally only use this if someone is
hitting my intended target or if there are multiple enchanters and a
big pull.  I also have a <B>Stop attacking %T so I can mez</B>
social that I pull out when someone is really ruining my day.

<P>
<B>%T is resisting mez</B> - Actually, I usually just type out "/g
RESIST" while Dazzle refreshes. I tend to forget about my hot keys
under pressure.  I don't actually bother announcing resists until a
creature has resisted me two or three times.  If there are other
enchanters present, they are probably alert to my situation already.

<P>
<B>%T cannot be mezzed</B> - Usually you will know before you try
whether a creature is mezzable.  Giants, for example, can't be stunned
in any way, which includes mez.  There are a few places where some
creatures of a particular type are mezzable and others are not, due to
some wacked out level restrictions.  In those cases, you will probably
need to try the mez to find out if it works, then shout this if it
doesn't.  I use /shout for this message to make it stand out from my
normal "mezzed" message which is in /ooc.

<P>
<B>%T is mezzed</B> - I use this for a while every time I join a new
group. After a while, everyone gets the idea that all the targets
except the current one are mezzed and I can stop spamming them.  On
raids, all mezzes should be announced.  It can be hard to tell the
difference between a slowed creature and a mezzed one unless you look
for a very long time.

<P>
<B>%T is slowed</B> - Again, I use this for a while in a new group so
that everyone knows I am slowing things, then I stop telling them
about it.  It is very rare that I am slowing things on a raid, since
there are nearly always shamans present.

<P>
<B>%T is Tashed</B> - I only use this on raids, and then only against
big bosses and highly resistant creatures.  It is particularly
important against huge nasty creatures who will kill you instantly
after you Tash them.  There's no sense having all the enchanters
killed that way.  If you really want your normal hunting group to hate
you, tell them every time you Tash something.

<P>
<B>%T is dispelled</B> - I normally tell the group that I will be
dispelling at the earliest possible opportunity, as soon as the
incoming message is announced or in advance.  For example, "I will
always dispel necromancers."  Then I use this macro so they can start
their debuffs.

<P>
<B>Sieving %T</B> - I use this when there are other enchanters on the
raid and I want them to help me.  You can use Theft of Thought to
identify which creatures have mana that needs to be sieved.

<P>
<B>Kill %T next</B> - I use this all the time.  See the <A
HREF=#system>Strategy</A> section.

<P>
<B>Attempting to charm %T</B> - This one I could see attaching to a
social, but since I don't always memorize charm in the same slot it
would be annoying. I don't charm all that often, so all my pet
commands and charm socials are on a separate panel.

<P>
<B>%M is charmed</B> - This is critical. Everyone needs to know when
you have charmed something.  See the <A HREF=#charm>Charm</A> section for pet
command socials.


<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=keys>Keys and Key Bindings</A></H2>

Now that we can assign virtually any keystroke to most game commands,
it's a good idea to take advantage of that capability.

The commands I use most commonly are:
<UL>
<LI>Sit/Stand
<LI>Open spell book
<LI>Ten hot keys in the hot box
<LI>Eight spell slots
<LI>Six group members
<LI>Target nearest NPC
<LI>Target/Use center screen
<LI>Target nearest PC
<LI>Switch cameras (see <A HREF=#target>Targetting</A>)
<LI>Select hotkey panel
</UL>
Those commands should be easily reached with a single keystroke.
I try to organize all my actions on my left hand and navigation on my
right hand.
<P>
By default Alt-1 through Alt-8 cast the spells and Shift-1 through
Shift-8 select hot key panels. I think it is better to move that
functionality to a single keystroke wherever possible.

<P>
Don't use the keys in your hot box for things you can map directly.
You will be casting spells a lot.  It is possible to drag your spell
icons down into your hot box, but resist the urge.  The same is true
of opening your spell book or sitting and standing.  Just practice
using direct mappings for a while until you are used to it.  You will
be glad to have room in your hot box for all the <A
HREF=#socials>socials</A> that you will want to use.  Also, if you
switch hot box panels a lot, you'll be sad because you'll have to put
the same commands in more than one of them.
<P>
One consideration when choosing key bindings for commands is that you can
use the numeric key pad without interrupting your chat.
If you talk as much as I do, it's very handy to be able to do things
like sit, stand or enter attack mode without interrupting your
conversation.
Here is a subset of the key bindings I use:

<H3><A NAME=slmez>Mesmerize</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Mesmerize, Enthrall, Entrance, Dazzle, Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture
</DIV>
<P>
Mesmerize spells put creatures to sleep.  They are the heart of the
enchanter's ability to control crowds.  Most of our strategies are
based around the properties of the Mesmerize line of spells.  We call
them <B>mez</B> spells.  When a creature is under the effect of one of
these spells, we say it is <B>mezzed</B>. 
<P>
The effect of a mesmerize spell is a long lasting stun that is broken
if the creature takes damage in any form.  Creatures that cannot be
stunned, such as giants, also cannot be mezzed.  While mezzed, a
creature cannot attack, move or cast spells.  Other spell effects,
such as snare, stun, weaken, or resist debuff, will not break a
mesmerize.  It can be dispelled.  It is important to <A
HREF=#socials>communicate with your group</A> to let them know what
creatures are mezzed so that nobody wakes them up.
<P>
These spells also have a <A HREF=#slblur>blur</A> component.  Often a
creature that has been mezzed will also be blurred, meaning it will
not come attack you when it wakes up.  This effect becomes less
reliable as you and your targets get to higher levels.  I often used
the mesmerize line of spells for the memory blur component up to about
level 40.  A couple of the higher level spells have a bonus to the
blur component, making them somewhat more reliable.
<P>
It's not necessarily a good idea to use your highest level mez spell.
The basic improvement, as you gain levels, is in duration.  It is nice
to have the creatures sleeping for a longer time between recasts, but
mana costs are higher and recast times are higher.  It is a lot easier
to get three things mezzed with a fast recast like Entrance than with
a slower one like Dazzle.

In certain old world zones, such as the Hole, creatures over level 52
cannot be mezzed.  This is a legacy of the days when 50 was the
highest level a player could reach, and only gods and other super
bosses were 53 or higher.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Mesmerization, Fascination
</DIV>
<P>
Mesmerization and Fascination are AE mez spells whose effect is
centered on your current target.  Fascination has a lower resist rate
than Mesmerization, but costs a lot more mana.
These spells are fantastic for disaster management, but they can be
tricky to use.
<P>
Both spells can affect up to five targets.  
It is entirely possible to catch yourself in the area of effect, which
is one reason to keep your <A HREF=#slresist>magic resistance</A> and
<A HREF=#slarmor>shielding</A> buffs on at all times.  You also take
up one of the five targets when it hits you.
<P>
When creatures are running all over the place, it can be handy to
target a group member with this spell instead of an enemy.
This gives you a known fixed point for the spell of someone who will
not charge over next to you when you cast.
They won't be mezzed by the spell, but they will count as one of the
five targets.
<P>
You cannot overwrite a single target mez with an AE mez or vice versa.
<P>
It is often desirable to <A HREF=#slroot>root</A> your mezzed
creatures, especially when using the AE versions of the spells.

<H3><A NAME=slstun>Stun</A></H3>

Stun spells prevent a creature from moving, attacking, or casting
spells.
<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Color Flux, Color Shift, Color Skew, Color Slant,
</DIV>
<P>
The color stuns are all point blank area effect centered around you.
It is a good idea to keep at least one of these memorized at all
times.  Once you have two or three available, you can keep a large
number of creatures permanently immobilized by chain casting them.
Be careful that you don't try this with creatures that are higher
level than you, because you will die if you get too many resists.
<P>
The casting times are shorter than the casting times of your <A
HREF=#slmez>mez</A> spells, so you can use them to stop creatures long
enough to mez them.

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1>

</TABLE></CENTER>
All of the Color Stuns have a 12 second recovery time, so you will
have to memorize at least two of them to keep creatures permanently immobilized.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Whirl til you Hurl, Dyn's Dizzying Draught, Lagarn's Lamentation,
</DIV>
<P>
These are single target stun spells.  Whirl til you Hurl and Dyn's
Dizzying Draught can be broken by damage or stuns, and are generally
considered completely useless.  Originally, Whirl til you Hurl was an
uninterruptable 12 second stun and was used by enchanters all the way
to level 50, but that was deemed too powerful, so the spell was nerfed
into uselessness.
<P>
Lagarn's Lamentation is a nice, eight second, single target stun that
also drains mana.  It is good for <A HREF=#casters>stopping casting
creatures</A>, but its high cost and long refresh time reduce its
usefulness. 

<H3><A NAME=slcharm>Charm</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Charm, Beguile, Cajoling Whispers, Allure, Boltran's Agacerie, Dictate
</DIV>
<P>
Charm spells turn the target into your pet.  For more insight, see the
<A HREF=#charm>Charm</A> section.

<H3><A NAME=slblur>Memory Blur</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Memory Blur, Mind Wipe, Blanket of Forgetfulness, Reoccurring Amnesia,
Memory Flux
</DIV>
<P>
Blur spells attempt to clear the hate list of the target(s).  
The higher level ones are more effective than the lower level ones.
Blanket of Forgetfulness is an AE blur, which is necessary when you
want to blur two adjacent creatures at once.
The AE version affects PCs, causing everyone in the area of effect to blink.

<H3><A NAME=slfaction>Faction</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Alliance, Benevolence, Collaboration
</DIV>
<P>
These spells temporarily raise your faction with one group of
creatures.  The spell lasts until you leave the zone.  Only one
faction can be raised at once, so new castings overwrite old ones.
The spell does not cause any aggro when cast.
<P>
These spells can be used in conjunction with <A
HREF=#slillusions>illusions</A> to allow you to move through dangerous
territory or to complete quests that require a certain level of
faction.
Be sure to /consider everything when you are traveling like this,
since cities and dungeons often contain creatures on separate
factions.


<H3><A NAME=sltash>Tash</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Tashan, Tashani, Tashania, Tashanian
</DIV>
<DIV class=spellname>
Wind of Tishani, Wind of Tishanian
</DIV>
<P>
Tash, in all its forms, lowers the magic resistance of your
opponents.  It is very handy for overcoming magic resistance.
However, it also causes a lot of aggro.  In general, I would not Tash
before mezzing unless it is absolutely necessary, because the Tashed
mob will come clobber you and interrupt your attempts to mez it.
<P>
Tash is completely unresistable and is poison based.  Dispel magic
will not get rid of it, but Cure Poison will.
<P>
If someone else is slowing or debuffing creatures, you should Tash
everything to help their spells stick.  Shaman slow spells seem to
have a higher resist rate than <A HREF=#slslow>enchanter slows</A>.
<P>
The Wind spells are AE Tash.  They are also called "Get Nekkid"
spells, since they generate the same aggro as a regular Tash on a
whole bunch of creatures at once.
There are very few instances where you would want to use them, but
they can be handy for large pulls in critical situations or in
situations where you are expendable.

<H3><A NAME=slslow>Slow</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Languid Pace, Tepid Deeds, Shiftless Deeds, Forlorn Deeds
</DIV>
<P>
Slow is great.  It slows the attack speed of your opponents.  This
keeps the group from taking as much damage, which saves your healers
mana and saves you grief.  Slow creatures while you have them
mezzed, then cast Memory Blur.
<P>
Shamans get better slows than we do, but if there is no shaman around
you should probably expect to slow everything your group fights.  If
there is a shaman around, make sure they slow all creatures while they
are mezzed.
<P>
Slow spells can be removed with Cure Disease spells.  They are not
removed by <A HREF=#sldispel>dispels</A>.

<H3><A NAME=slfear>Fear</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Fear, Chase the Moon, Invoke Fear, Trepidation
</DIV>
<P>

Fear causes things to run away.  Unfortunately, without a Snare spell
of any kind, they usually run away pretty fast.  It is possible to
fear creatures and have your pet hit them from behind as they run, but
players have a hard time keeping up with creatures that are running at
full speed.
Using Fear in a dungeon or any crowded area can be hazardous, since
the creature will eventually come to its senses and return to you
along with everything it met in its flight.
<P>
As an enchanter, about the only time I use Fear is when I am outdoors
soloing things that are really too tough for me or when grouped with a
druid, ranger or necromancer for classic Fear kiting.
<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Eye of Confusion
</DIV>
<P>
Eye of Confusion actually causes blindness rather than fear.  If you
cast it on another player, they will experience this effect.  However,
blindness is implemented very strangely for monsters and often causes
them to flee.

<H3><A NAME=slroot>Root</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Root, Enstill, Immobilize, Paralyzing Earth, Fetter
</DIV>
<P>
Root spells prevent a creature from moving, but still allow it to
attack anything next to it and cast spells.
They do not always last their full duration.  There is a small chance
for the creature to break root on every tick and there is a
substantially larger chance to break root whenever the creature is hit
with a direct damage or stun spell.
<P>
Root can be used as a poor man's mez on mel&eacute;e creatures.  Just root
them out of range.  It is not nearly as effective as <A
HREF=#slmez>mez</A>, since many creatures can have a deceptively long
mel&eacute;e range and many players seem incapable of moving out of range of
rooted creatures.

<H3><A NAME=sldebuffs>Debuffs</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Weaken, Ebbing Strength, Feckless Might, Insipid Weakness, Weakness
</DIV>
<P>
These spells lower the target's STR.  There isn't much point to them,
since strength doesn't affect mel&eacute;e much.  The only real use is to
encumber people in PvP.
<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Enfeeblement, Disempower, Listless Power, Incapacitate, Cripple
</DIV>
<P>
These spells reduce AC, so they are actually useful to cast against
really tough creatures.  Shamans get the same line of spells, so they
will usually have this responsibility.
<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Curse of the Simple Mind
</DIV>
<P>
This spell lowers INT and WIS.  However, since that only lowers mana
capacity rather than actual mana, this doesn't help a whole lot.  The
primary use of this spell is that it makes your target "look stupid".

<H3><A NAME=slvisage>Visage</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Haunting Visage, 
Horrifying Visage, <BR>
Calming Visage, 
Beguiling Visage, 
Glamorous Visage
</DIV>
<P>
These spells increase or decrease the amount of hate generated by the
actions of the target.  It is useful to cast Haunting or Horrifying
Visage on the main tank in a battle to help them keep the monsters
attention.  Similarly, casting any of the others on yourself before
you <A HREF=#sltash>Tash</A>, on a cleric before they heal, or on a
wizard before they blast will help prevent your target from gaining
the attention of the foe.  None of these spells has a particularly
strong effect on hate, except the self-only Beguiling Visage.

<H3><A NAME=slmana>Mana Drain and Mana Stealing</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Mana Sieve, Wandering Mind, Theft of Thought, Torment of Argli
</DIV>
<P>
Mana Sieve takes mana away from your target.  It is completely
unresistable.  You will find yourself casting this spell over and over
when you face a caster that can't be <A HREF=#casters>stopped with
other spells</A>.
<P>
Torment of Argli drains mana from your target over time and has a few
other cute effects.  It is very efficient at removing casting ability
from your opponents, but it is resistable.
It also has a DoT component, which means you cannot cast it on mezzed
creatures and you need to use caution when casting it on creatures
that you may later want to mez.
<P>
Wandering Mind and Theft of Thought both steal mana from caster
creatures and give it to you.  Both spells have a very long recharge
time and can only be cast on creatures that have mana.  Wandering Mind
steals the mana and gives it to you over time.  Theft of Thought is
instantaneous.
You can use either of these spells to determine that a creature has
mana to sieve.  If Theft of Thought cannot be cast on it, then there
is no point casting Mana Sieve.

<H3><A NAME=sldispel>Dispel</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Taper Enchantment, Cancel Magic, Strip Enchantment, Nullify Magic,
Pillage Enchantment, Recant Magic
</DIV>
<P>
Dispels remove magic-based spells from your target.  The higher level
dispels remove more spells and more reliably, up to a maximum of four
spells removed at once.

<H3><A NAME=sldirect>Direct Damage</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Chaotic Feedback, Sanity Warp, Chaos Flux, Anarchy, Discordant Mind, Dementia
</DIV>
<P>
Our direct damage spells are reasonably efficient in terms of mana,
but they have a very long recast time, they generate a
disproportionate amount of aggro, and they are very resistable.
However, they also have an instantaneous stun effect that is great for
<A HREF=#casters>interrupting casters</A>.
I often keep Chaotic Feedback memorized even now for that purpose.
<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Gravity Flux
</DIV>
<P>
Gravity Flux is an area effect spell, centered around your current
target.  It flings the creatures up into the air with a damaging blast
and they take extra damage on their landing.

<H3><A NAME=sldot>Damage over Time</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Shallow Breath, Suffocating Sphere, Choke, Suffocate, Gasping Embrace, Asphyxiate
</DIV>
<P>
Our Damage over Time (DoT) spells include very nice debuff components,
reducing the AC of the target among other things.  Unfortunately,
several other classes have a line of spells that is better and
doesn't stack with them (Necromancer Heart Flutter line and the
Shaman and Druid epic DoTs, at least).
<P>
Also, if a creature has a DoT on it, you can't <A HREF=#slmez>mez</A>
it.  The next tick of damage will wake it up.  For that reason, be
very careful when using your DoTs on creatures you may want to mez
later and caution others about the same.

<H3><A NAME=sllull>Lull</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Lull, Soothe, Calm, Pacify
</DIV>
<P>
Lull spells, like Harmony, reduce the radius of response of the target
to a fraction of its original value.
Once a creature is Lulled, you can walk quite close to it or attack
creatures nearby without aggroing it.
Unlike Harmony, however, the Lull spells are resistable and will cause
aggro when resisted.
It is possible to use Lull to pull single creatures from a group, but
if one resists, you will probably get the whole group.
<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Wake of Tranquility
</DIV>
<P>
Wake of Tranquility is an AE Lull.
Due to its high resist rate, it is not particularly useful.
We usually call it "Wake of Trainquility".

<H3><A NAME=slclarity>Clarity, Int, Wis and Mana Buffs</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>

</DIV>
<DIV class=spellname>
Insight, Brilliance, Enlightenment,
</DIV>
<DIV class=spellname>
Gift of Magic, Gift of Insight, Gift of Brilliance
</DIV>

<P>
Spells in the Clarity line all give increased mana regeneration.  The
amount of mana is insignificant compared to normal meditation rates,
but it is a huge improvement over your standing regeneration rate of 1
mana/tick.
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1>

<TR><TD>Koadic's Endless Intellect</TD><TD>Group spell, +14 mana/tick,

</TABLE></CENTER>
You should try to keep these spells on every group member who has
mana, including hybrids.  It may not seem like a ranger or paladin's
mana pool is important, but they get very little chance to meditate
and their spells are very useful to the group.

<P>
Insight, Brilliance and Enlightenment raise the target's Wisdom, Intelligence, or both,
respectively.  The amount of mana capacity added by these spells is
well worth the effort as long as their mana stat is not above 190 unbuffed.
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR>

</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
so every point of INT up to 200 gives the target an additional
Level/5 mana.  After 200 INT, you only get half as much mana point, so it
is less worthwhile to keep these buffs on.


<P>
The Gift spells add to your maximum mana and the later two add a small
mana regeneration component.

<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD>Gift of Magic	</TD><TD>+50 max mana	</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Gift of Insight	</TD><TD>+100 max mana, +1 mana/tick	</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Gift of Brilliance	</TD><TD>+150 max mana, +2 mana/tick	</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>

I don't think Gift of Magic is really worth casting unless you are in
a situation where you have a lot of time to meditate between short
bursts of activity where you run close to empty.  In normal hunting,
when your mana is fluctuating between 20%-80% capacity without
reaching either extreme, the mana you spend casting Gift of Magic is
wasted.

<H3><A NAME=slcharisma>Charisma Buffs</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Sympathetic Aura, Radiant Visage, Adorning Grace, Overwhelming Splendor
</DIV>

<P>
According to Verant, Charisma affects the resist rates on mind spells,
which includes our <A HREF=#slcharm>Charm</A>, <A HREF=#Slmez>Mez</A> and Fear lines.  In testing, the
difference between high charisma and very high charisma gives only a
few percent improvement in resist rates.  However, since we care a lot
about those resist rates, it seems worthwhile to put some effort into
maintaining a high charisma.  I generally try to keep my Charisma
about equal to my Intelligence with buffs and gear.  I keep my best
Charisma buff on myself and on anyone who is charming things, which is
usually bards and some druids.

<H3><A NAME=slarmor>Armor</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Minor Shielding, Lesser Shielding, Shielding, Major Shielding, Greater
Shielding, Arch Shielding, Shield of the Magi
</DIV>

<P>
Shielding spells increase your maximum hit points, give you some AC
and some magic resistance.  You should keep it up at all times.
Shaman Talisman spells will overwrite our shielding spells, giving
more hit points, but no AC or magic resistance.  In any situation
where I care what my magic resistance is, either because I am facing
caster creatures or using AE mez, I ask shamans not to cast Talisman
on me.  You can cancel the Talisman and recast your Shielding, but 
then you will need a heal.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Haze, Mist, Cloud, Obscure, Shade, Shadow, Umbra
</DIV>
<P>
These spells increase AC only.  Clerics have better AC buffs, but they
are a lot more expensive, so you should probably keep your AC buff on
yourself and any other casters in the group.  When there is no cleric
in the group, keep your best AC buff on everyone.

<H3><A NAME=slresist>Magic Resistance</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Endure Magic, Resist Magic, Group Resist Magic
</DIV>
<P>
Magic resistance reduces the chance that magic-based spells will take
effect on you.
Keep these up all the time.  Magic resistance saves you from your own
mezzes.  It also saves your puller from Fear and Root.  Only if you
are certain that your group will face no casters should you stop
giving magic resistance to the other members of your group.

<H3><A NAME=slrunes>Runes</A></H3>

Both the Rune and Berserk spells absorb a fixed amount of damage
before falling.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Rune I, Rune II, Rune III, Rune IV, Rune V
</DIV>
<P>
The Rune spells have a very long duration, but take a gem component.
Rune spells can be used to compensate for bad healers, but it's a
pretty expensive solution to the problem.  It's much nicer to find a
better healer.
<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Berserker Strength, Rampage, Berserker Spirit, Bedlam
</DIV>
<P>
The Berserk spells last only a few minutes and they also raise STR and
lower AGI.  Don't fret about the lowered AC from your reduced AGI
since the damage you take is being absorbed anyhow.  These spells are
very useful when you are grouped with tanks and have no healing at
all.  Between Berserk and bandages, you should be able to fight nearly
continously.

<H3><A NAME=slhaste>Haste and Augmentation</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Augmentation, Augment, Visions of Grandeur, Speed of the Shissar, Speed of the Brood
</DIV>

<P>
The Augmentation line raises attack speed less than the pure haste
line, but also raises AGI and regenerates stamina. 

<P>
You should keep your best haste spell on the tanks at all times.  Make
them tell you when it wears off, since the spells are generally too
mana intensive to cast on yourself for timing.

change your apparent race to NPCs, which affects their reactions to
you.  It is possible to travel many places under illusion where you
would be slain instantly in your normal form.  There are a few
cautions though:

<UL>

<LI>Other factors such as religion and your past deeds will still have
their normal effect on your faction and things you do in one illusion
form will affect your faction no matter what form you wear.  You
cannot go on a killing spree under an illusion and expect to be
welcomed back in your normal form.

<LI>Elemental, wolf, skeleton and imp forms are not welcome in many towns.
Check your factions carefully before you use an illusion form near
NPCs who are not normally hostile.  Target one of them and move far
away to test the spell.

<LI>If you go linkdead in a dangerous place, you will be back in your
native form when you return.  If your connection is unstable, it is
advisable to keep invisibility up and move hastily when using
invisibility to travel in hostile areas.

</UL>
<P>
Some illusions let you get spell effects without a component, which is
very handy when you are recovering your corpse and without any spell
components at all.  Some effects can only be achieved by illusion.

All illusions have a duration of roughly half an hour, except for Boon
of the Garou.
Boon of the Garou lasts for six minutes and takes three minutes to
refresh (which we call a three minute "hold time").
If you are going to keep Boon of the Garou on someone, you will have
to devote a spell slot to it.

<H3><A NAME=slanimations>Animations</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Pendril's Animation, Juli's Animation, Mircyl's Animation, Kilan's
Animation, Shalee's Animation, Sisna's Animation, Sagar's Animation,
Uleen's Animation, Boltran's Animation, Aanya's Animation, Yeogreff's
Animation, Kintaz's Animation, Zumaik's Animation
</DIV>

<P>
The animations are your pets.  They are stupid and don't take commands
like other pets.  For <A HREF=#charm>charmed pets</A>, you will need
the full set of commands and practice using them, but the animations
pay no heed to such things.  An animation will attack anything that
attacks it or you and it will keep attacking until it is dead or its
target is dead.

<P>
For this reason, animations interact very badly with mezzing.
You can use <A HREF=#slblur>memory blur</A> to make your pet forget
that it is mad at something, but it is nearly impossible to get it off
a target once it is hitting it.

<P>
Each spell gives you a pet within a small range of levels.  For the
most part, the pets range from green to blue when you first get them
and are all green by the time you get the next pet.  At certain
levels, they gain new abilities: Double Attack, Dual Wield, Bash, etc.
Your pet will not Dual Wield unless you give them a weapon, but it
only takes one since they come with one weapon.

<P>

<DIV class=spellname>
Reclaim Energy, Summon Companion
</DIV>

<P>
Reclaim Energy kills your pet and returns you some of the mana you
used to cast it.  This is a useful spell when you are trying for a pet
at the high end of the level range.  It does not return your tiny daggers.

<P>
Summon Companion calls your pet to your side from wherever it has run
off to.  The spell will not work if your pet is aggroed on anything or
in combat.

<H3><A NAME=slenchantments>Enchantments</A></H3>

Enchantments are used to create items that are used in craft skills.
The items created are permanent, unlike Magician summoned items, but
they all require an unenchanted component to cast.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Enchant Silver, Enchant Electrum, Enchant Gold, Enchant Platinum,
Enchant Velium
</DIV>

<P>
These metal enchantments turn an unenchanted bar of metal into an

This spell turns a block of clay into an enchanted block of clay for
Pottery.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Thicken Mana, Crystallize Mana, Clarify Mana, Distill Mana, Purify Mana

<P>
These enchantments summon a vial of mana of some description.
The spells require a lined vial and a gem or gems.
The resulting vials of mana are used for Tailoring and possibly other crafts.

<H3><A NAME=slother>Other Junk</A></H3>

<DIV class=spellname>
Gate, Bind Affinity
</DIV>

<P>
Gate transports you to your home point.  Bind Affinity sets your home
point to your current location.  You can cast Bind Affinity on others,
but only within town zones and a few specific other locations.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Invisibility, See Invisible, Invisibility vs. Undead, Improved Invisibility
</DIV>

<P>
Invisibility hides you from most creatures and players, other than
undead and creatures with the innate ability to see invisible things,
such as giants.  See Invisible allows you to see players or creatures
that are Invisible.

<P>
Invisibility vs. Undead hides you from the undead, such as ghosts and
skeletons.  You cannot have both regular Invisibility and Invisibility
vs. Undead at the same time.

<P>
If you are attacked while invisible or if you enter attack mode or
cast a spell of any kind, you will become visible.  Invisibility also
has a chance to drop before its duration has expired.  When this
happens, the icon will not blink, but you will get a message that you
are about to become visible.  You have about five seconds to find a
safe spot when you see that message.

<P>
Improved Invisibility can only be cast on yourself, but it never drops
early.  It is still broken by attacks or spell casting.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Strengthen, Enduring Breath, Everlasting Breath, Levitate, Levitation, Feedback
</DIV>

<P>
Strengthen increases your STR by 10, which can help with encumbrance.

<P>
Enduring Breath lets you breathe underwater; it takes a fish scale.
Levitate lets you walk on water or float down safely from heights; it
takes a bat wing.
If you are short on fish scales or bat wings, use
<A HREF=#slillusions>Water or Air Elemental Illusion</A> 
on yourself instead. 
The Enduring Breath and Levitate spells will hold across zone
boundaries and can be cast on others, so they do have some benefits
over the elemental forms.
Also, the elementals are regarded with hostility by many creatures in
Norrath, particularly town guards.
With Luclin, upgrades to Levitate and Enduring Breath were added that
do not take components.  Levitation and Everlasting Breath are
difficult to find, but very handy if you can get them.

<P>
Feedback gives the target an 11 point damage shield.  This is pretty
nice when you get it, but becomes relatively useless later on.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Invigor, Extinguish Fatigue
</DIV>

<P>
These spells replenish stamina.  Pretend you don't have them, since
you will rarely have the spell slots, mana or attention to spare to
cast them.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
True North, Sentinel, Identify
</DIV>

<P>
True North points you to face due North.
It's main purpose is to practice Divination skill, but it may have
some application to navigating if you don't have a good Sense Heading
skill.

<P>
Sentinel is intended to warn you when a creature is approaching an
area, but in practice it just causes spam and sparkles.
Casting Sentinel in a crowded area can cause people or whole zones to
crash, so it is generally considered antisocial.
It might even get you petitioned.

<P>
Identify returns additional Lore information about an item held on
your cursor.  You can cast it on others, but only they receive the
information.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Serpent Sight, Ultravision
</DIV>

<P>
These spells give the target night vision, either red tinted
infravision from Serpent Sight or a somewhat brighter, blue tinted
Ultravision.
If you are night blind, you can use <A HREF=#slillusions>illusions</A>
to give yourself night vision.
If infravision is not adequate, try turning up your monitor
brightness; it should be plenty.

<P>
<DIV class=spellname>
Bind Sight, Shifting Sight, Cast Sight
</DIV>

<P>
These spells change your camera to the view point of the target.
The later ones add infravision and ultravision.
In principle, you should be able to use them to see what your puller
is doing.
They all make me really queasy, so I don't use them much.

<P><HR>

<H2><A NAME=skills>Skills</A></H2>

Your spell skills (Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration, Divination,
Evocation) should mostly go up through normal use.  
Keep your <A HREF=#slresist>magic resist</A> and <A
HREF=#slother>strength</A> buffs up on your whole group all the time.
The buffs are nice and they keep your Abjuration and Alteration skills
up to par. 
<A HREF=#slmez>Mezzing</A> will keep your Conjuration good as long as
you go places that require a fair amount of it.  
You can use <A HREF=#slstun>color stuns</A> to practice Divination and
<A HREF=#sldirect>direct damage</A> spells to practice Evocation.
Even when it is not necessarily optimal to cast those spells, still
try to work them in so that none of your skills fall too far behind.
Low level spells are just as good practice as high level spells.
<BR>The maximum value for these skills is (Level + 1) * 5.
<P>
<EM>Keep your Defense skill maxed!</EM> At any given moment, you don't
want to be getting hit.  However, in the long run, you will want to
have been swung at a fair amount, because that is the only way to
practice Defense.  The longer you go, the harder it is to raise,
because the only way to practice is to be hit by things that con light
blue or better.  When you get Dodge at level 22, you will practice
that as you practice Defense.  <BR>The maximum value for Defense is
(Level + 5) * 3.
<P>
The rest of your combat skills are not generally important to an
enchanter; you will not be swinging a weapong to any great effect
after about level 16.  It's fun to keep them all maxed, but it won't
really affect your performance in the long run.
<BR>The maximum value for Offense is (Level) * 4.
<BR>The maximum value for weapon skills is (Level + 1) * 3.
<P>
Sense Heading and Swimming are general skills that are useful to
have.  The easiest way to practice Sense Heading is to put it in a hot
key and bind that hot key to a commonly used key, such as the key you
use to walk forward.  Every time you walk forward, you will practice
the skill, so you should be at max value in no time.  Swimming can
only be practiced by doing it, so step in every pool you find.  Spend
some time dipping in the nearest ocean or lake whenever you can manage
it.
<BR>The maximum value for these skills is (Level + 1) * 5.

<P><HR>

<H2><A NAME=specialization>Specialization</A></H2>

At level 20, you may begin to specialize in a particular school of
magic.  The Specialization skill gives two benefits when you
cast spells of that school.  Every time you cast a spell, your
specialization skill is checked.  If that skill check succeeds,

<UL>
<LI>the spell costs 25% less mana and
<LI>the chance to fizzle is reduced.
</UL>

Fizzling a spell costs you some mana and a tiny amount of time.  The
actual delay caused by a fizzle depends on your network connection.  I
feel that the primary benefit of specialization is the reduction of 
mana cost of your spells.  If you have a particulary slow response on
fizzles, your experience may be different.

<P>
You will get some specialization skill in each of your five schools of
magic.  When you put one point into the skill at level 20, you will
begin with a skill of 20.  The first of the five skills to break 50
will be allowed to reach 200; the rest will be capped at 50.  No skill
will be able to break 50 until you have trained all five skills.  The
skill that breaks 50 is called your <B>Primary Specialization</B>.  It
is possible to change your primary specialization after this, through a quest
in the Temple of Ro, but it's very tedious and costs a ruby, so you
are better off choosing the right one first.  Here are the five
schools ranked in the order I would choose them for primary specialization:

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Alteration</B></TD><TD><A HREF=#slclarity>Clarity</A>, <A

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Evocation</B></TD><TD><A HREF=#sldirect>Direct Damage</A>
</TABLE>

<P>
It has been my experience that I spend most of my mana casting
Alteration spells at all levels.  Haste and slow both use a huge
amount of mana.  Keeping Clarity and other desirable buffs on a group
can consume a large amount of mana as well.  This mana is not normally
spent during combat, but it will affect your overall performance.  If
you have to spend a lot of mana buffing, you will have to wait longer
to be ready for a combat or you will have less mana going into the
combat.

<P>
My advice to an enchanter considering their specialization is to
choose <B>Alteration</B>.  Your Alteration skill will rise so much
faster than the rest that it is safe to put a single training point
into all five skills as soon as you reach level 20.  Your Alteration
skill will probably hit 51 and be locked in before any of the others
hit 40.

<P>
Some people prefer to specialize in Conjuration.  The reasoning is
that the mana you spend on Conjuration spells is spent at critical
times.  When you are casting a mez, you really want it to happen NOW.
Also, there can be battles that rage so severely that you can actually
run yourself from full mana to empty, casting only mesmerization
spells.


<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=book>Spell Book Arrangement and Memorization</A></H2>

As you go up in levels, you will find that you have a huge number of
spells that you will use regularly.
With only eight spell slots, you will probably have to swap spells in
and out quite often.
I find it useful to keep the spell book very well organized so that I
can swap spells quickly in and out as needed.
It's not important how you group the spells as long as you can
remember what you put on each page.
It is not important what pages you use for what spells; you can
use the /book command to get to any page instantly. 
I like to keep my most common spells further into the book than page one, so
that I can quickly flip pages backwards <I>or</I> forwards to get to other
common spells.

<P>
This is the spell book layout I use:

<UL>
<LI><B>1-4:</B> <A HREF=#slillusions>Illusions</A>
<LI><B>5-6:</B> <A HREF=#slother>Gate, Bind</A>, <A HREF=#slanimations>Pet</A>
<LI><B>7-8:</B> <A HREF=#slother>Invis, Utility spells</A>
<LI><B>9-10:</B> Common buffs (<A HREF=#slclarity>Clarity</A>, <A
HREF=#slhaste>Haste</A>, <A HREF=#slarmor>Armor</A>)
<LI><B>11-12:</B> <A HREF=#slmez>Mez</A>, <A HREF=#slstun>Stun</A>, <A HREF=#sldirect>Direct Damage</A>
<LI><B>13-14:</B> <A HREF=#slcharm>Charm</A>, <A HREF=#sldispel>Dispel</A>, <A HREF=#slslow>Slow</A>, <A
HREF=#slroot>Root</A>, <A HREF=#sldebuffs>Debuffs</A>
<LI><B>15-16:</B> <A HREF=#slmana>Sieve</A>, <A HREF=#sltash>Tash</A>, <A HREF=#sldot>Damage over Time</A>,
<A HREF=#slblur>Memory Blur</A>, <A HREF=#slfear>Fear</A>
<LI><B>21-26:</B> <A HREF=#slenchantments>Enchantments</A>
<LI><B>27-28:</B> Very little used buffs
<LI><B>31-50:</B> Obsolete spells
</UL>

Flipping pages is a bit slow, so another useful thing to do
is to set up a panel of socials with /book commands.
The first hotkey I generally hit when I log in is my Spell Book Buffs
hot key:

<P>
<DIV class=say>
/book 9
</DIV>

<P>
This command opens up the spell book to page 9.
On the same hotkey panel, I have shortcuts to all of the major
offensive spells and buffs in slots 1-6.  I put illusions,
enchantments and the twink spells page shortcuts in 7-10 since you
can't see the labels on those when you are in the spell book.
You can still use the hot keys even when you can't see them, but I
don't want anything to slow me down when swapping spells in combat.
So, with two key presses, I can select that panel, select my spell
book page, and be looking at the spells I want to memorize.

<H3>Memorized Spells</H3>

Eight spell slots is not nearly enough.
The spells you keep handy will depend a lot on what you are doing, who
is in your group, and what tactics you like to use.
Here is my normal lineup:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF=#sltash>Tash</A>
<LI><A HREF=#slmez>Dazzle (or Glamour of Kintaz)</A>
<LI><A HREF=#slmez>Mesmerization (or Fascination)</A>
<LI><A HREF=#slstun>Color Shift (6 second stun)</A>
<LI><A HREF=#slstun>Color Skew (8 second stun)</A>
<LI><A HREF=#slmana>Theft of Thought (steal mana)</A>
<LI><A HREF=#slslow>Slow</A>
<LI>Buffs (swap spot, might hold some other useful spell between buff cycles)
</UL>

<P>
In general, you probably won't keep a buff memorized unless it has an
extremely short duration, like Feedback or Boon of the Garou.  When <A
HREF=#buffs>buffing</A> your group, you will want to memorize each
spell, cast it on everyone who needs it, and then forget the spell.
It might seem that you are wasting mana by refreshing a buff long
before it is going to wear off, but it will make your life a lot
easier if you don't have to memorize all your buffs again for each
person.

<P>
I always keep one AE stun and one AE mez handy.
Those two spells can thwart a disaster instantly.
You will feel really silly if you get annihilated by a train that you
could have stopped if you had kept those spells up.
Alternatively, you can keep two stuns up and memorize AE mez between casts if you need it.

<P>
If you have a shaman in the group or if you are fighting extremely
weak creatures, slow is unnecessary.  Otherwise you should expect to
keep it memorized and cast it on almost everything.

<P>
Depending on what kind of foes we are tackling, I may replace the
second stun and the slow with other spells.  Sometimes I remove Theft
of Thought if I know I will not be facing casters.  Generally I will
choose the replacements from the following:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF=#slroot>Root</A>
<LI><A HREF=#slrunes>Berserk</A>
<LI><A HREF=#slcharm>Charm</A>
<LI><A HREF=#sldispel>Dispel</A>
<LI><A HREF=#slblur>Memory Blur</A>
</UL>

<P>
Root is very nice for nailing down mezzed creatures so that they don't
charge you when they wake up.  It's also utterly necessary if you are
fighting in a group with no taunting fighter.  Rooting the creature in
place while everyone else kills it allows you to sit and regain mana
much sooner.

<P>
Berserk (or Rune if you are rich) is nice to have if your healer is
not prompt about healing you.  It's necessary if your group has no
healer.  If you can afford the mana, keeping some kind of rune spell
on yourself will help you channel spells, because you don't take any
damage until it wears off.

<P>
Charm is a great solution for unmezzable creatures.
There are whole strategies based on <A HREF=#charm>Charm</A>, so I'll
talk about it in its own section.

<P>
When you are fighting for a long time in a place where mez is useless,
your entire spell lineup will probably change.
Giants and dragons are immune to mez, so charm and root become a lot
more important.
When fighting such creatures, I replace all of the mezzes and stuns
with charm, dispel, root, and mana stealing spells.

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME=equip>Equipment and Stats</A></H2>

When you first start out, you'll probably be happy to get anything at
all in each equipment slot, but eventually you will have some choices
to make.  When choosing one item over another or deciding
whether to pursue a quest, consider how much of the important stats
that item will give you:

<UL>
<LI><B>Intelligence or Mana</B>
<LI><B>Hit Points (or Stamina)</B>
<LI><B>Resistances</B>
<LI><B>Armor Class (or Agility)</B>
<LI><B>Charisma</B>
</UL>

Try to strike a balance in these stats.  Many people have a tendency
to aim for a really huge Int and a lot of +Mana items, completely
neglecting all other stats.  If you follow that route as an enchanter,
you will probably find yourself dead at 80% mana on a regular basis.
As early as possible, keep an eye out for +HP items.

<P>
When you die, think about what happened.  If you find yourself dying
with tons of mana left because the cleric couldn't heal you fast
enough, consider some +HP items.  If you find that you run out of mana
and the situation gets away from you, consider +Int and +Mana items.
If you are getting blown up by wizards or stunned and rooted by
clerics, work on your resistances; resistances are relatively easy to
raise and very effective.  If you are having a terrible time with mez
resists, even after <A HREF=#sltash>Tash</A>, you might consider
raising your charisma, but raising your HP is often a better choice.
You <I>will</I> have mez resists, no matter what your charisma is, but
more HP will help you survive them.

<P>
It is very hard to raise your AC to a level where it will do you any
good at all, but it is not impossible.  For any given creature, there
is a wide range of AC values where your armor is irrelevant; the
creature will hit for maximum damage nearly every time.  Then, there
is a small range over which increasing your AC substantially reduces
the damage you take.  Then it levels off again into a realm where you
have achieved as much as you can with your armor.  With effort and
sacrifice, you can eventually get high AC items that will help you
survive combat.  You will only really see an effect when you are being
pounded by things that con blue to you, but that becomes more common
as you gain levels.  In mel&eacute;e, it is better to reduce the
damage you take by 10% than it is to raise your HP total by 10%,
because you require less healing and your spells are interrupted
slightly less often.  However, don't take that logic to extremes
because you will also face casters that don't care what your AC is.

<P>
Raising your <B>Intelligence</B> (Int) gives you mana in proportion to your
level.  As described with the <A HREF=#slclarity>Int/Wis buffs</A>,
each point of Int up to 200 gives you <I>Level/5</I> points of mana,
each point of Int from 200 to 255 gives you <I>Level/10</I> points of
mana.  So, at level 60, you will get 12 mana for every Int up to 200
and 6 mana for every Int after 200.  For example, if you were to
choose between a bracelet that gave you 15 mana and a bracelet that
gave you 3 Int, the 15 mana bracelet would be preferable until level
25.  If your Int were already at 200, then the 15 mana would be
preferable until level 50.

<P>
Intelligence has a small benefit beyond merely giving you mana.  It
also affects the rate at which you learn non-combat skills.  This is
actually governed by the larger of Int and Wis, but as an enchanter,
your Int will be larger.  This is most important for craft skills, so
you may want to hold onto your Int items for crafting.

<P>
<B>Charisma</B> (Cha) has a barely measurable effect on resist rates for
<A HREF=#slcharm>Charm</A> and <A HREF=#slmez>Mez</A> spells.  Counted
as a fraction of all casts, it is not worth mentioning, but counted as
a percentage reduction in resists, it is noticeable.  You should make
your own decision about how much you value Charisma.  My advice would
be to consider it a nice bonus on an item, better than Dexterity or
Wisdom, but not something that is worth sacrificing other useful stats
for.  The line of <A HREF=#slcharisma>Charisma buffs</A> is quite
powerful and will probably be adequate to keep your Charisma at a
reasonable level.

<P>
<B>Stamina</B> contributes moderately to your hit point total.  At
level 60, you get about 2.25 hit points per point of Stamina, and it
varies linearly by level.  At 40, you get about 1.5 hit points per
Stamina and at 20 you get about 0.75 hit points per Stamina.

<P>
<B>Agility</B> contributes to your total AC in a very minor way.  Each
point of Agility gives you only about 0.2 points of total AC.  By
contrast, each point of raw AC on an item gives you about 1.2 points
of total AC.  Relatively large changes in Agility are barely
noticeable, so don't give up much to get Agility.

<P>
The other stats have no appreciable effect.  Strength will affect how
much you can carry without being slowed down.  Dexterity will affect
how quickly you raise your combat skills, so get it buffed when you
are working on your Defense.  Wisdom does absolutely nothing for you.

Realm Enchanter Forums</A> - This is the main discussion site for
enchanters.

<LI><A HREF=http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Enchanter>Casters'
Realm Spell List</A> - This is the first place to check when you are
trying to find new spells.

<LI><A HREF=http://www.geocities.com/xymarra/Spells/encspell.html>My
Spell List</A> - This compact spell list is designed to be printed.
The data was extracted with the EQ Caster program.  It includes a
brief summary of spell locations and an exact description of spell
durations (without AAs).

This online spell database contains all current spell information as
well as a history of changes for every spell and a database of items
that have spell effects.

<LI><A HREF=http://www.eqcaster.com>EQ Caster</A> - This spell data
file parser is quite complete and correct.  Unfortunately, it has not
been updated since August 2002.
