				<tr><td>
					<p class="justify" align="left">This is basicaly an explenation of the stats based on info given by Verant, personal results of ingame experience, and tests specified to verify any hyphothesis. A large part of this was done with help from a post on the Official Everquest message board by Arcke.</p>
				
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Strength</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Strength directly affects how much you can carry. Each strength point is equal to one weight point you can hold without becoming incumbered. At which point your agility begins to go down and you move slower. Strength's aplication to combat is in how hard you can hit and raises the average damage delt. Specificaly it raises the damage cap. This can be seen signifigantly after the level 20 damage cap is lifted.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Stamina</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Stamina affects both your hit points and your endurance to hard labor. Be it running to town or away from a monster. Be it fighting a mob for an extended time. Stamina plays a role. Less you have the quicker you will tired. This lowers you stats when you tire, and slows you down. The more stamina you have also the more hit points you have. At this moment however only Verant knows the exact formula for deriving ones hit points. However we do know what different types of classes have different formulas and especialy with warriors we know there are bonuses at certain levels. Much time is being spent on this and maybe some time in the future we will get an answer.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Agility</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Agility has an effect on AC (Armor Class) that seems simple at first but later misleading. Agility has been thought of as effecting your defensive skills, such as making dodge or block occur more for people of higher agility. However as has been resently stated by Verant it in fact does not, but it does help in the influence of skill increase of such defensive skills. The direct effect that agility has on AC (more agility more ac, not 1 to 1 ratio) suggests that it either effects "Damage avoidance" or "Damage mitigation" of AC. A guess is damage avoidance. We do know that more agility mean you get hit less. But we have no idea what skill "miss" falls under.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Dexterity</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Dexterity does not have a direct effect on any other stat. Such as ATK (Attack) for example. It was also stated by Verant that dexterity does not effect success of hits of any hand to hand weapon nor does it directly effect the channeling skill of a magic class. However, it does effect the rate of process (when a weapons effect triggers), rate of critical hit procs (short for process), direct effect of hiting with a bow and arrow, influences of a skill increase for parry, riposte, channeling, and weapon skills, and success of certain Rogue skills (unknown which ones).</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Wisdom</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Wisdom directly effects the priest class (Cleric, Shaman, Druid, Ranger, Paladin) by way of mana. More wisdom you have the more mana you will have. Wisdom might also have an effect on the success of trade skills. No one knows how much an effect it has, but it is generaly believed that the more wisdom you have the easier it is to succeed on making an item. I would guess its alot like luck, but more perminant. It is also said that wisdom effects your resistance to mind oriented spells, such as charm. Recently it has been stated that whichever of the two mana stats (intelligence or wisdom) is higher, effects learning of skills.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Intelligence</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Intelligence effects the pure casters (Wizard, Enchanter, Magician, Necromancer) as well as the non-priest class (Shadow Knight). Same as wisdom the more intelligence you have the more mana you will have. Intelligence also helps in learning skill, whichever of the two mana stats (intelligence or wisdom) is higher is what counts toward learning skills. The more intelligence you have the faster you will learn things.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Charisma</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Charismas main effect is on non-player characters. The more charisma you have the less the vender will markup what he/she sells to you, and more she/he will pay you when you sell them something. Charisma also effects mind oriented spells that you cast. Specificaly the classes that charm (Enchanters, Shamans, Druids). Recently someone suggested that charisma also effected faction. In such a way that higher charisma might actualy makes good faction move faster and bad faction move slower.</p>

					<p class="s2b" align="left">Armor Class</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Direct quote from Abashi:</p>
					<p class="quote" align="left"><blockquote>"AC, for instance, is the combination of a "Damage avoidance" factor, and a "Damage mitigation" factor."</blockquote></p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Atack</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Direct quote from Abashi:</p>
					<p class="quote" align="left"><blockquote>"ATK is comprised of "chance to hit" and "damage potential"."</blockquote></p>
