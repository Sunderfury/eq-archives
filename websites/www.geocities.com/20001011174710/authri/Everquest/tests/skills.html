					<p class="justify" align="left">There are a variety of skills in EverQuest, and learning and developing those skills is key to a character's success in the game. How a skill works in-game depends on the type of skill. Some skills are triggered automatically, while others are used at the player's discretion. Also, some skills are very general and shared by all, while others are specific to certain races and classes. In general, the more the character attempts to use a skill, the better he or she will become at it. The following is a list of several skills, including a short description. Keep in mind, however, that this list is intentionally incomplete – some skills are more obscure and difficult to learn, and it will be up to the player to discover them and their uses as they explore the world that is Norrath.</p>
  
  					<p class="s2b" align="left">Abjuration</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">One of the several skills related to the art of magic, abjuration deals with defensive magic, for example a spell that enables the character to take less damage from extreme cold.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Alteration</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Another of the several skills related to the art of magic, alteration deals with changing things, whether it be illusion or an actual physical change. An example would be a spell that teleports something, or that enables a character to move faster, or forces him or her to move more slowly.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Archery</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">In addition to the skills dealing with melee combat, range weapons are also prevalent in the world. The skill of archery deals with a characters efficiacy in using bows, crossbows, and other similar devices.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Backstabbing</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">The Rogue has in his repertoire many unique skills, including the ability to strike at his opponent from behind, often dealing a great deal of damage in one blow.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Bash</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Certain races and classes have the ability to knock an opponent down, thereby both disorienting him, lowering his defenses, and also interrupting the process of spellcasting.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Block</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Negating an attack by deflecting the blow with one's body is a skill unique to the Monk, and blocking is one of several skills available to that class.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Blunt, Slashing, & Piercing Weapons</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Combat is rather integral to the game, and there are a variety of weapons available to the combatant. In general, these weapons are broken up into three categories, blunt, slashing, and piercing, as well as whether they require one or two hands to wield. The better one is at these skills, the more effective they are with that weapon.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Channeling</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">One of the several skills related to the art of magic, channeling allows the caster to regain concentration and continue casting a spell after being hit.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Conjuration</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Another of the several skills related to the art of magic, conjuration brings something from elsewhere into the world, whether they be elemental creatures or powerful clouds of energy.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Disarm</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">This skill allows the combatant to dislodge a wielded weapon from his opponents hands, knocking it to the ground, and forcing him, at least for the moment, to fight hand-to-hand.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Divination</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Another of the several skills related to the art of magic, spells of divination allow the caster to both detect things previously concealed, as well as to conceal things previously visible.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Dodge</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">One of the better ways to negate damage is to completely avoid the blow itself, and the skill of dodging allows the combatant to do just that.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Dual Wield</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Certain classes will be able to wield a weapon effectively in both hands, thereby increasing the number of attacks and thus the amount of damage dealt in a given amount of time.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Evocation</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Another of the several skills related to the art of magic, evocation deals with things that go boom. Fireballs, force spells, etc. all fall under the auspices of this offensive skill.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Foraging</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Being at home in the wilderness has many benefits, including the ability to forage food. This skill has been known to save quite a few trips back to town when the supplies have inadvertently run out mid-quest.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Hand-to-Hand</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Although this skill can be mastered by only the Monks, most every other class can at least throw the occasional punch. Besides, one never knows when one might be relieved of one's weapon, both during combat and at other times.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Kick</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Being able to dish out a bit more damage during combat is attractive to many of the warrior classes in the game, and kicking one's opponent in unpleasant places in between sword swings does just that.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Meditate</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Another of the several skills related to the art of magic, meditation allows the caster to memorize spells more quickly.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Pick Lock</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Oftentimes finding that precise key is just too time consuming or expensive, and the lock picking abilities of the Rogue class come in very handy.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Safe Fall</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Monks, being typically unencumbered by heavy armor and weapons, often work on their ability to fall great distances, yet still land on their feet, incurring minimal if any damage.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Sense Direction</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Although compasses are known to exist, they are also typically rare and expensive. Certain races and classes, however, have the innate ability to determine their heading and direction. Then again, they are also often times wrong.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Singing</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Bards (one can at least hope) have great singing voices. And the better they are at this art, the more effective their songs, which are themselves often magical in nature.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Steal</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Another art known only to the more shady of individuals, this Rogue-specific skill allows the miscreant to pilfer items from both players and NPCs. Their intended victim, however, will at times detect this activity, and will rarely appreciate the attempt.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Stringed Instruments</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Certain Bard songs require certain instruments, and the better the minstrel is at playing Stringed Instruments, the more effective he or she will be at playing those songs.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Swimming</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Many areas in the world of Norrath are covered by water, and one's ability to maneuver in that environment is directly related to one's skill level in swimming.</p>
					
					<p class="s2b" align="left">Wind Instruments</p>
					<p class="justify" align="left">Certain Bard songs require certain instruments, and the better the minstrel is at playing Wind Instruments, the more effective he or she will be at playing those songs.</p>
