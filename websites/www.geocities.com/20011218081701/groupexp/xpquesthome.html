    <dd><font color="#00FF00" size="4">- Well, so far I have received one bug report (and a few wish lists, hehe). Apparently, if you are showing xp/kill info for one player and disable that player, then subsequently attempt to select another player to display xp/kill info for, the program crashes. I'm looking into this. Keep the emails coming, I appreciate the input/help!</font></dd>

<dl>
    <dd><font color="#00FF00" size="4">- Updated both GroupExp and Exp.xls with the correct multipliers for levels 51 thru 60 (Thanks to Eric for pointing this out). As well, GroupExp was updated to fix the incorrect calculation of xp from 51 to 60.</font></dd>

<dl>
    <dd><font color="#00FF00" size="4">- Well, nothing ever seems to work as planned. When updating the GroupExp zip with the necessary DLLs, it seems I neglected to update the executable*sigh*. This problem is now corrected.</font></dd>
</dl>


<dl>
    <dd><font color="#00FF00" size="4">- The GroupExp zip now includes BOTH necessary DLLs. GroupExp should now work as intended. See the included Readme file for information about installing the DLLs. Thanks again for your patience.</font></dd>

    <dd><font color="#00FF00" size="4">- GroupExp requires MFC42D.DLL (a debug version of MFC42 - GroupExp.exe is currently a debug build), which I neglected to include in the Zip. This will be rectified tonight.</font></dd>
