Jeb Lumsed is the one who will give you your epic staff.

<P>
You will first exchange a copy of research notes from Stofo Olan for
<A HREF=#seal>Jeb's Seal</A>.  This act gives you the faction you need
to speak with the four masters of enchantment (without need for
Collaboration).  <A HREF=#seal>Jeb's Seal</A> will prove your worth to
the four masters of enchantment, which will enable you to obtain the
<A HREF=#sack>Enchanter's Sack</A>.

<P>
After you have obtained all four pieces of staff from the four masters
of enchantment, Jeb will accept the four combined pieces of staff and
give you the <A HREF=#staff>Staff of the Serpent</A>.

Stofo Olan is the key to beginning the quest.  You must collect
magical writing materials for him so that he can give you a copy of
his research notes (<A HREF=#notes>Copy of Notes</A>) to give to Jeb
Lumsed.

Each of the four masters of enchantment will ask you for four items,
which must be combined in an <A HREF=#sack>Enchanter's Sack</A>.  Once
combined, the sack will be named for the master who is to receive it
(i.e. "a sack for Modani" or "a sack for Mizzle").  In exchange for
the bag of items, the master of enchantment will provide you with one
piece of the staff.

<P>
You can begin to collect all of the items before you have <A
HREF=#seal>Jeb's Seal</A>, although you may need to use Collaboration
on Nadia to get the dull gems.

<P>
You can acquire the four pieces of staff in any order.  Jeb's seal is
not changed by handing it to the four masters of enchantment.  You do
not gain any faction by doing so.  The only reason to hand the seal to
any <I>particular</I> master is to hear their lines of dialogue.  You
will need to hand the seal to some master to get the sack once for
each of the five times you need to combine items.

Be careful!  Before handing any item to any NPC, be sure to talk
through the quest dialogue.  If you are multi-questing, have your
multi-quest partner talk through the lines as well before you start
handing in items.  (The <A HREF=#notes>Copy of Notes</A> is the only
portion of this quest that can be multiquested.)  If the NPC gives the
proper responses, they should also return the items as expected.

<P>
None of the NPCs will deal with you before you are level 50.

<H1>Jeb Lumsed</H1>

<B>Jeb Lumsed</B> - Burning Woods (-1200 -4000) - a sarnak imitator

<P>
You say, 'Are you Jeb Lumsed?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Yes I am. Use your most enlightened magic to
seek the truth of what is around you. When that is done, you will know
what you seek.

<P>
<I>
Jeb lives in a small ruin about midway up the East side of the
Burning Woods zone with a few sarnaks.  Jeb will not take offense if
the other sarnaks are mezzed or killed in his presence.  Just watch
your AE spells.

<P>
Jeb spawns a day or two after the servers come up, but he does not
despawn and nobody has any particular reason to kill him.  So, you may
have to wait for him if there has been a server reset lately, but he
will be up most of the time.  The same is true of the four masters of
enchantment.

<H3>Jeb's Seal</H3>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC=JebsSeal.GIF alt="Jeb's Seal" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=80>
You give the "<A href=#notes>Copy of Notes</A>" to Jeb Lumsed.
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'I see that you have what I was waiting
for. Stofo does do excellent work. It seems that you are to start on a
long journey. Take this seal and it will guide you on your next
step. Seek out the masters of enchantment. In time we will craft the
Serpent for you. When you have collected the four parts of the staff,
you must combine them in a bundle for me. If you need a sack, just let
me know.'
<BR>You receive a coin called "Jeb's Seal".

<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Take this sack and combine the items I
requested in it. Then return it to me. 
<BR>You receive an Enchanter's Sack.
<H4>New Enchanter's Sack</H4>

You give <A HREF=#seal>Jeb's Seal</A> to any of the four masters of
enchantment (<A HREF=#modani>Modani</A>, <A HREF=#mizzle>Mizzle</A>, <A HREF=#nadia>Nadia</A> or <A HREF=#polzin>Polzin</A>).

<BR>You receive Jeb's Seal back.
<BR>You receive an Enchanter's Sack.

<P>
<I>
The sack you receive is the same sack from any master.  It would work
fine to get the sack from Nadia every time you have four pieces to
combine.  Note that the sack is LORE, so you can only have one empty
sack in your inventory at any given time.  Jeb will no longer give you
a sack when you ask for one.

<P>
Make sure you have two top level inventory slots open when you get a
sack.  You will get the seal back first, which will fall into one top
level slot, then you need a second slot open for the sack.  
If you do not have two top level slots available, both items will
appear on your cursor, which may be awkward if you don't have anywhere
to place the sack.

<P>
You say, 'What serpent?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'The first truly powerful enchanter, Krilan
Pedin, crafted the Serpent years ago. He trained his students to carry
on the trade in a five-step process. Each student then became a master
and chose one of their own students to pass the legacy on to. Four
others and I, myself, are current practitioners of the crafting.

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC=JebsItems.JPG alt="Jeb's Items" WIDTH=119 HEIGHT=245>
You say, 'Who are the masters of enchantment?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'The masters are enchanters who have reached
the plateau of understanding. Their names are Modani Qu'Loni, Mizzle
Gepple, Nadia Starfeast, and Polzin Mrid. All are master crafters in
their own right.

<P>
You say, 'Who is <a href=#modani>Modani</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Modani is a master of illusions. You should
seek him out first. Keep a careful eye out for him - he is never in
his true form. The last time I spoke to him, he seemed very excited
about his voyage to the elven outpost. You may or may not find more
clues about his location there.

<P>
You say, 'Who is <a href=#mizzle>Mizzle</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Mizzle is a gnome who has mastered the use of
enlightened magic. Go to him once you have spoken to Modani. Mizzle is
not one to travel, so you should not have to look far from his home to
find him.

<P>
You say, 'Who is <A href=#nadia>Nadia</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'The mistress of charm, Nadia is very
beautiful. She, too, traveled with her relatives to the new land. I
just recently received a letter from her. She says more and more
pilgrims and explorers are arriving every day, and that the outpost is
well defended now.

<P>
You say, 'Who is <A href=#polzin>Polzin</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Master of the Phantasms - he is the last one
you will seek out. Hmm...Polzin is native to Erudin, however, after
the incident near Paineel, no one has heard from him. I hope that he
is well.

<B>A Spectral Librarian</B> - Kaesora (85.19, -415.31, 98.46)

<P>
<I>
It is quite easy to get into the Library.  Basically you enter
Kaesora, cast invis, go straight forwards, drop down the hole with
levitate, don't go all the way down, just head forwards onto the ledge
in front that you can see. Face directly away from the door, enter the
room with the 3 spiders and turn right and go thru that door. Directly
behind the door there is a secret wall, go through that and then
*just* before you hit the corner, cast invis undead. Follow the
passage going down until you come to a large area with a
building. Inside that building is the Spectral Librarian, or the
Tortured Librarian. Not sure on which one is the place holder, as the
Tortured Librarian dropped a Kunzar Cloak, so perhaps he is the rare
and the spectral librarian is the place holder. 

<P>
On a side note, if you go up to the 2nd floor of the Library you
can also pick up a piece of the Medallion needed to enter Veeshan's
Peak.

everything in that last building once you have cleared the reaver, and
the Wraith of Jaxion should spawn eventually.

<I>
<BR>A Level 51 named Scorpikis with five guardians. 

<P>
It is not necessary to kill anything to receive the emerald.  

<P>
If your Venril Sathir faction is high enough you may not even have to
charm Impaler Tzilug.  
Go in with Illusion: Dry Bone and Collaboration.
If he is dubious or better, hand him the gem.

<P>
However if you cannot approach him, here's one strategy:
Have a cleric run up to the guardians under the effect of Divine Aura.  
Being Invulnerable (s)he can "tank" while you
mesmerize/enthrall/entrance the guardians, charm Tzilug, hand him the
emerald, and get out.

<P>Another strategy for charming Tzilug is to have a druid pull him by
casting harmony on his guards to get him alone. 

<P>Yet another strategy is to cast Rune on yourself, run in Flux,
AE Mes, charm and get out.   

<P>
He will attack you after you hand him the emerald, breaking charm if you
used charm.  (If someone else has handed him a gem since the last
server reset, he will not attack.)

Apparently Impaler Tzilug does not always break charm and attack after

resets, so if someone else has done it since the last server reset,
you should be safe.
