Jeb Lumsed is the one who will give you your epic staff.
<P>
You will first exchange a copy of research notes from Stofo Olan for
<A HREF=#seal>Jeb's Seal</A>.  This act gives you the faction you need
to speak with the four masters of enchantment (without need for
Collaboration).  Jeb's Seal will prove your worth to the four masters
of enchantment, which will enable you to obtain the <A HREF=#sack>Enchanter's Sack</A>.
<P>
After you have obtained all four pieces of staff from the four masters
of enchantment, Jeb will accept the four combined pieces of staff and
give you the <A HREF=#staff>Staff of the Serpent</A>.

Stofo Olan is the key to beginning the quest.  You must collect
magical writing materials for him so that he can give you a copy of
his research notes (<A HREF=#notes>Copy of Notes</A>) to give to Jeb Lumsed.

Each of the four masters of enchantment will ask you for four items,
which must be combined in an <A HREF=#sack>Enchanter's Sack</A>.  Once
combined, the sack will be named for the master who is to receive it
(i.e. "a sack for Modani" or "a sack for Mizzle").  In exchange for
the bag of items, the master of enchantment will provide you with one
piece of the staff.

<P>
You can begin to collect all of the items before you have Jeb's Seal,
although you may need to use Collaboration on Nadia to get the dull
gems.  

<P>
You can acquire the four pieces of staff in any order.  Jeb's seal is
not changed by handing it to the four masters of enchantment.  You do
not gain any faction by doing so.  The only reason to hand the seal to
any <I>particular</I> master is to hear their lines of dialogue.  You
will need to hand the seal to some master to get the sack once for
each of the five times you need to combine items.

Be careful!  Before handing any item to any NPC, be sure to talk through the quest
dialogue.  If you are multi-questing, have your multi-quest partner
talk through the lines as well before you start handing in items.
(The <A HREF=#notes>Copy of Notes</A> is the only portion of this quest that can be
multiquested.)  If the NPC gives the proper responses, they should also
return the items as expected.
<P>
None of the NPCs will deal with you before you are level 50.

<B>Jeb Lumsed</B> - Burning Woods (-1200 -4000)

<P>
You say, 'Are you Jeb Lumsed?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Yes I am. Use your most enlightened magic to
seek the truth of what is around you. When that is done, you will know
what you seek.

<P>
<I>Jeb lives in a small ruin about midway up the East side of the
Burning Woods zone with a few sarnaks.  Jeb will not take offense if
the other sarnaks are mezzed or killed in his presence.  Just watch
your AE spells.
<P>
Jeb spawns a day or two after the servers come up, but he does not
despawn and nobody has any particular reason to kill him.  So, you may
have to wait for him if there has been a server reset lately, but he
will be up most of the time.  The same is true of the four masters of
enchantment.

<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'I see that you have what I was waiting
for. Stofo does do excellent work. It seems that you are to start on a
long journey. Take this seal and it will guide you on your next
step. Seek out the masters of enchantment. In time we will craft the
Serpent for you. When you have collected the four parts of the staff,
you must combine them in a bundle for me. If you need a sack, just let
me know.'
<BR>You receive a coin called 'Jeb's Seal'

You say, 'I need a sack'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Take this sack and combine the items I
requested in it. Then return it to me. 
<BR>You receive an Enchanter's Sack.
<H4>New Enchanter's Sack</H4>
You give Jeb's Seal to any of the four masters of enchantment (Modani,
Mizzle, Nadia or Polzin). 
<BR>You receive Jeb's Seal back.
<BR>You receive an Enchanter's Sack.

<P>
<I>
The sack you receive is the same sack from any master.  It would work
fine to get the sack from Nadia every time you have four pieces to
combine.  Note that the sack is LORE, so you can only have one empty
sack in your inventory at any given time.  Jeb will no longer give you
a sack when you ask for one.
<P>
Make sure you have two top level inventory slots open when you get a
sack.  You will get the seal back first, which will fall into one top
level slot, then you need a second slot open for the sack.  
If you do not have two top level slots available, both items will
appear on your cursor, which may be awkward if you don't have anywhere
to place the sack.

<P>You say, 'What serpent?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'The first truly powerful enchanter, Krilan
Pedin, crafted the Serpent years ago. He trained his students to carry
on the trade in a five-step process. Each student then became a master
and chose one of their own students to pass the legacy on to. Four
others and I, myself, are current practitioners of the crafting.

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC=JebsItems.JPG alt="Jeb's Items" WIDTH=119 HEIGHT=245>
You say, 'Who are the masters of enchantment?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'The masters are enchanters who have reached
the plateau of understanding. Their names are Modani Qu'Loni, Mizzle
Gepple, Nadia Starfeast, and Polzin Mrid. All are master crafters in
their own right.

<P>You say, 'Who is <a href=#modani>Modani</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Modani is a master of illusions. You should
seek him out first. Keep a careful eye out for him - he is never in
his true form. The last time I spoke to him, he seemed very excited
about his voyage to the elven outpost. You may or may not find more
clues about his location there.

<P>You say, 'Who is <a href=#mizzle>Mizzle</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Mizzle is a gnome who has mastered the use of
enlightened magic. Go to him once you have spoken to Modani. Mizzle is
not one to travel, so you should not have to look far from his home to
find him.

<P>You say, 'Who is <A href=#nadia>Nadia</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'The mistress of charm, Nadia is very
beautiful. She, too, traveled with her relatives to the new land. I
just recently received a letter from her. She says more and more
pilgrims and explorers are arriving every day, and that the outpost is
well defended now.

<P>You say, 'Who is <A href=#polzin>Polzin</A>?'
<BR>A sarnak imitator says, 'Master of the Phantasms - he is the last one
you will seek out. Hmm...Polzin is native to Erudin, however, after
the incident near Paineel, no one has heard from him. I hope that he
is well.

information concerning the history of the Serpent.'

<BR>Stofo Olan says, 'It may seem like ordinary paper at first. However,
this paper was enchanted by a friend of mine. This paper was given to

The Freed Souls have AE fire spells explode with a nasty AE fire
blast when you kill them and are immune to fire damage, but only have
about 1 hitpoint each.  :)

She's a tiny Chromodrac.  Skyfire is exactly like Trakanons
Teeth. Consider Felia to be the Skyfire version of the Froglok
Forager/Hunter spawns. With a druid/ranger you can pull the funky
spawns and eventually you will get her. All of these spawn near the
Burning Woods zone and people who camp that area see her dozens of
times a day. Mobs there will agro her and kill her soon after she
pops.

The Wraith of Jaxion spawns at the final building (the one that the
last reaver and Neh'Ashiir spawns in). The wraith has a placeholder,
and it goes around the building. Keep killing everything in that last
building once you have cleared the reaver, and the Wraith of Jaxion
should spawn eventually.

<I>
<BR>A Level 51 named Scorpikis with five guardians. 

<P>
It is not necessary to kill anything to receive the emerald.  

<P>
If your Venril Sathir faction is high enough you may not even have to
charm Impaler Tzilug.  
Go in with Illusion: Dry Bone and Collaboration.
If he is dubious or better, hand him the gem.
He will attack you after you hand it to him.
<P>
However if you cannot approach him, here's one strategy I have heard:
Have a cleric run up to the guardians under the effect of Divine Aura.  
Being Invulnerable (s)he can "tank" while you
mesmerize/enthrall/entrance the guardians, charm Tzilug, hand him the
emerald, and get out.

<P>Another strategy for charming Tzilug is to have a druid pull him by
casting harmony on his guards to get him alone. 

<P>Yet Another strategy is to just cast Rune on yourself, run in Flux,
AE Mes, charm and get out.

The same revenants that drop Insidious armor drop the Essence of a
Vampire.  The essence seems to be about as rare as any given piece of
Insidious armor.  Many raids will see no essence, others may see two.
Do not panic if you go on half a dozen raids without seeing the
essence.  Just make sure the revenants are all being killed.
