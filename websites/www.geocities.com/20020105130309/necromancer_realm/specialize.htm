	   <h1>Necromancer Specialization</h1>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Now that you've finally gotten your necromancer to level 20, it's time to decide what you're going to specialize in. This is quite an important
		decision to make. Specialization affects all spells of a certain spell class, ie. all conjuration, abjuration, evocation, etc. What specialization
		does for you, is lowers your mana cost of spells, lowers your chance to fizzle your spells, giving you that bit of an edge against your opponents.
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		How specialization works in the game is very simple. Each time that you cast one of the spells in the class that you've specialized in, the game
		rolls on a specialization table, obviously the higher the roll you have, the better the effect, and vice-versa. If you fail the roll for your spell, then the
		game casts the spell with the ordinary amount of mana, and the same chance to fizzle.
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		We know you're asking how do I specialize. Well, you have to go to your guild and train in it.. put one skill point in each spell class 
		then go to a newbie area and use your level one spells of your chosen specialization 
		category and either hit yourself with the spell or the small creatures with them. Either way, your specialization will go up quite quickly.  Keep in mind,
		you train in more than one specialization, the first one that gets to fifty-one is the one that becomes your primary specialization, and thus gets
		the bonuses thereof. Specialization can go up to two-hundred. This is keeping with the usual five plus five times your level. So at twenty, you could get
		your primary specialization to one-hundred and five. 
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The next question is what happens if i mess it up, and get the wrong specialization to fifty-one. No worries, you can go to the Temple of Ro in Lavastorm
		and talk to Ostorm and there you will learn how to reset your specialization. Note that it will reset all of your specializations back to one, so make sure that
		you get the one that you want to fifty-one first.  

		There are only three spell classes that we recommend that you choose. These classes are:<br><br>
		
		Alteration<br>
		Conjuration<br>
		Evocation<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		We will discuss the benefits of having each of these as a specialization. Being Necromancers, We have the hardest choice of a specialization.

		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Alteration, is the class that all of your lifetap series spells, most of your Damage over Time(DOT's) spells, and undead charm spells originate. This is typically
		the most widely chosen specialization, for the simple fact, that necromancers live and die over lifetaps and DOT's. The undead charm part of Alteration,
		isn't that commonly used, which would be the only reason for not choosing this as a primary specialization. 
		<br><br>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Conjuration is the skill that is used for all of the poison and disease based spells that you get, as well as the darkness series of spells, not to mention your pet spells. 
		Many of these spells are quite expensive as you level, mainly your pet spell. Conjuration is the second most chosen of the specializations, because the
		snare&DOT darkness spells, are quite handy for the soloing necromancer. It also keeps your down time to a minimum when you're trying to cast a decent
		pet in an area where a pet is a necessity for survival. Poison and Disease are also widely used by necromancers, making the choice for a specialization all
		the more harder.
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The last spell class is Evocation. This is the class that is used for most of your direct damage spells. Just as a tidbit of information on this one, there are only 
		fourteen spells for a necromancer in this category. Ones who choose this class as a specialization would be those who prefer to group as to solo for the majority
		of their lives. Direct damage kills things, and quickly, unlike the DOT's. If your best friend is a Wizard, don't even think about choosing this one, because there is 
		no way that you can out damage a wizard, simply put, that's what they do. This is the best choice for those who have a supportive guild behind them, and their vast 
		majority of time is spent in large groups.
		<br>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		We here at Necromancer's Realm, after thorough research into the specialization, have come up with Alteration as the best specialization. The reasoning behind
		our decision is simply necromancers DOT, Disease and Lifetap. This is the Necromancer's bread and butter. Again, since this is simply a guide, what we have
		posted here is merely a recommendation. Make your own decisions, don't let us make them for you. Make your character uniquely your own. Take it from us, it's 
		more fun that way.
