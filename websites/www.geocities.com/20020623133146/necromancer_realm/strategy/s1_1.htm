		<h2>Beginning Life as a Gnomish Necromancer</h2>
		<br>
		<h4>
		The first thing that you want to do, is obviously turn your note into your guildmaster. This task may proove more daunting that it first seems, if you do not know Ak'Anon that well. Your guild
		is located in the Mines of Malfunction. This place is a maze of tunnels. It is located at the very back of the city. Once you find your guild, turn in your note, so you can get your robe, and train
		in Piercing. Next task... Find your way out of Ak'Anon and into steamfont. As with nearly every starting point in the game, there is a newbie area in steamfont, where you want to begin your 
		hunting. This is easy to get to. As soon as you leave Ak'Anon, go straight for a short distance, then veer to the left, around the mountain on your left. this will take you to a fairly large area, 
		that looks like a giant pit, and this is where you'll find Giant Rats, and Decaying Gnome Skeletons, Diseased Rats, Spiderlings, Rogue Clockworks, and Kobold Runts. I would recommend killing off the Decaying 
		Gnome Skeletons, and the Giant rats. The Decaying Gnome Skeletons should be amiable to you, which means that they will not attack you of their own accord. You can attack these at will.
		This is something that is highly recommended, since Bone Chips are a necessity. You should remain in this area until about level four. There is a merchant at the druid rings in the newbie 
		area, so that you can sell what you loot, without having to go back into town. Once you get level four, you'll want to make sure that you have gotten all of your level 1 spells, as well as all of
		your level 4 spells. At this point, with the help of your pet, you should be able to solo a single spawn Kobold that is just above the newbie area, to the left of the Kobold tents. They should be 
		yellow to you at this point. You can solo them with your pet, using the following combination of spells, and assisting your pet with weaponry backup. You should have Lifetap and Lifespike
		memmed, as well as clinging darkness, poison bolt, Siphon Strength, Disease Cloud, Grim Aura, and Fear. This will allow you to do what is called reverse kiting if the need should arise. Usually 
		you use Clinging darkness to pull with, then send your pet to attack, then cast poison bolt, then disease cloud, then siphon strength. Then walk up to it, yes walk up to it, and attempt to hit it with
		your weapon. This is so that your pet doesn't die. At early levels you need to do this in order to keep your pet alive. If it appears that you and your pet are taking a severe beating, then cast fear
		on it, and follow it, casting lifetaps until your fear wears off, by this time you should be able to kill it. You can stay here and do this until about level eight. At level seven the three kobolds at the camp
		can be easily taken with you and a partner. At level eight, you get a new spell, called Ward Undead. This is your first Evocation spell. As such, you have no skill in Evocation, unless you put some skill
		points into it earlier. When you get this spell, you and your new pet can move out to the skeleton camp, they are at the dragon skeleton farther out in Steamfont, If you shout, someone should be able to 
		tell you where it is at. Now, before going out there, i recommend that you use your Ward undead spell on the Gnome Skeletons, this way your Evocation will go up. This is very important. Once you arrive
		at the skeleton camp, you'll probably want to find a partner, because the skeletons out here will be yellow and red to you. You and a partner should be able to take these Skeletons up until about level 12, 
		at about level eleven, i'd recommend soloing the skeletons, with your pet, and your new spell, you should be able to take the biggest of them solo. From this point on, the world is open for you to 
		explore and find things to kill. As a side note, some people who have played on Faydwer, tend to go to Greater Faydark, and hunt Orcs out there to level. This can proove disastrous for you as a necromancer,
		because at this point, you are able to buy and sell in Neriak. This may not seem like such a big deal, but it will save you from having to go all the way back to Ak'Anon for your new spells. And this is
		just my 2 cp. Enjoy.<br>
