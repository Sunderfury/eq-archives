<H2>Overview</H2>The Crypt of Dalnir is the resting place of the Haggle Baron, 
Dalnir. It is a mid level dungeon located within the Warsliks Woods.
<P>The entrance to the Crypt is at location (3490,3900). The easiest way to find 
the entrance, once in Warsliks Woods, is to head north until you reach the 
ocean. From there follow the coast east or west until the second coordinate 
reaches 3900. Now face south and head inland until the other coordinate matches. 
The entrance is a hole in the side of the hill facing the ocean and is quite 
difficult to find, even when standing next to it.
<P>The dungeon is suitable for levels 25 to 45. A full group of 25's may not get 
much further than Level 1 while level 45 characters will not be seriously 
challanged and will not get much experience.
<P>This guide and the maps are still very much in the draft stage. It will be 
updated as more information is discovered. The latest version of this guide can 
be found <A href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir.htm">here</A>. Please 
send any corrections/additions to me at kith@iweb.net.au.
<P><A name=Monsters>
<H2>Monsters</H2>There are four types of monsters in the Crypt of Dalnir: 
Nibblers, Goos, Coerced and the Kly.
<P><B>Ravenous Nibblers:</B> These flying fish creatures are pure melee and 
wander throughout the dungeon. They are level 25-28.
<P><B>Goos:</B> There are two types of goos in the Crypt, gyrating goos and 
smoldering goos with the smoldering being the tougher of the two types.
<P>Both types of goos are straight melee mobs but they can proc <B>Goop 
Poison</B>, a 600 damage poison which does 33 damage per tick. With 21 poison 
resist I killed 30 goos and was poisoned 5 times. With 86 poison resist I was 
never poisoned.
<P><B>Coerced:</B> There are many coerced races throughout the Crypt including 
gnomes, erudites, dwarves, iksar, tier`dal and goblins. Each coerced monster can 
be any of the classes including magicians, fighters, wizards, necromancers and 
shamans.
<P><B>Kly:</B> The Kly look like Sarnak's and are only found in the lower two 
levels of the Crypt. There are six types of Kly. Kly Followers and Cohorts are 
warriors, Kly Evokers and Invokers are wizards and Kly Acolytes and Beleivers 
are shamans. For each class the second type of mob mentioned is the tougher of 
the two. Kly vary from 25 to 32 in level.
<P>I do not have accurate level information on the monsters in Dalnirs but they 
are somewhere in the 25-35 mark.
<P>When killed all mobs give negative faction with ThrallOfKly.
<P>Most of the monsters in the Crypt do not see invisible, with the exception of 
the Goos and the occasional coerced so moving from place to place and corpse 
recovery should be relatively easy. When invisible the monsters still "scowl at 
you". Either the con message is a bug or the fact that they do not attack is a 
bug. Lets hope for the former ;-)
<P>All monsters in the Crypt are on a 13 minute spawn cycle. There are many 
wanderers all throughout the zone and most of the time there are many mobs 
packed in close together which makes it fairly challenging. Also the large 
number of casters in this dungeon makes it more difficult than the level of the 
mobs might indicate.
<P><B>Non-Aggro Mobs</B>: All types of mobs in the Crypt are KoS (Kill on Sight) 
to even level 51 characters but rarely both Ravenous Nibblers and Gyrating Goos 
can spawn in non-aggro mode. I have not seen any other type of mob do this. This 
is very handy when camping certain spots solo. this non-aggro feature works for 
at least level 40 characters. I do not know the lower level for them to be 
non-aggro.
<P>For example when I camped for my batons I was able to get 10 out of 13 mobs 
in the Loop/Pool area spawned as non aggro nibblers, leaving only the two 
lumpies and one wanderer for me to deal with.
<P></a><A name=Maps>
<H2>Maps</H2>This map is fairly accurate but the scale is off in places. 
Definately the best map of Dalnir I have ever drawn!
<P><IMG alt="Dalnir Map" src="../../Maps/Wrenn/dalnir.jpg" width="880" height="770">
<P><A name=Level1>
<H2>Level 1</H2>The first level of the dungeon contains several small caves and 
the top level of the crypt. It contains all monster types but the Kly. There are 
many wanderers and some spawn right at the zone point so take care if resting 
there.
<P><B>1 - Cave:</B> This cave contains the entrance to the main crypt at the 
eastern end. Also near the north wall of this cave you can find the first 
journal entry, <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Day47">Day 47.</A>
<P><B>2 - Dalnir's Tomb:</B> In the center of this room is Dalnir's Crypt. Climb 
onto this and jump down it to drop to Level 2. The drop is quite long and 
depending on weight you may take 200+ damage from the fall. Levitation is 
recomended for those without safe fall. No damage is taken if you have 180 Safe 
Fall (probably a lot lower is sufficient). The room you drop into contains many 
wanderers so invisibility is useful in assuring a safe arrival. There is no 
known way to return to Level 1 from Level 2 so make sure you are ready before 
taking the plunge.
<P><A name=Level2>
<H2>Level 2</H2>This level is where you first meet the Kly.
<P><B>3 - Pool Room:</B> This is the chamber into which you will drop from Level 
1, landing in the center of the pool to the west of the room. The entire room is 
patrolled by wanderers so it may be best to move on quickly unless you plan on 
setting up camp here.
<P><B>4 - Checkerboard Room:</B> In the north section of the Pool Room is a set 
of stairs leading down and into this room. It is free of monsters and no 
wanderers enter this room so it is an ideal place to rest or set up camp. There 
is a catch though. The checkerboard pattern at the base of the stairs is a pit 
trap that takes you to level 3. It is possible to avoid the pit by keeping to 
the walls and not walking on the pattern. This pit is similiar to the previous 
one and levitation/invisibility are recommended. There is no know way to get 
from Level 3 to Level 2.
<P><B>5 - Loop:</B> This series of caves contains several mobs two of which are 
placeholders for the <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#LGoo">Lumpy Goo</A>'s. 
There are two lumpies in this area, the <B>Rug Lumpy</B> spawns in a cave at the 
back which contains a fire and two rugs (marked <B>R</B>). The <B>Thistle 
Lumpy</B> spawns at the edge of the loop (marked <B>T</B>).
<P><B>6 - Bedrooms:</B> In this set of rooms you can find the second journal 
entry, <A href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Day48">Day 
48</A>. I have not finished the map here but there are several rooms and 
passages.
<P><B>7 - Exit, Stage Left:</B> There is a zone here that will take you outside 
the Crypt to Warsliks Woods. This is another nice place to camp due to the 
proximity of the zone.
<P><B>8 - Imprecator Room:</B> In this room spawns the first <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Imprecator">Kly 
Imprecator</A>. Also in this room can be found the <B>Kly Channeler</B> but he 
does not appear to drop anything.
<P><A name=Level3>
<H2>Level 3</H2>This is the final level of the crypt. It is broken into two 
sections, seperated by a one way secret door. The area into which you first drop 
is the "Blacksmith" area, and beyond the secret door lies the "Overseer" area.
<P><B>9 - Crossroads:</B> This is where you drop into this level from Level 2. 
Wanderers pass through here frequently so be ready when dropping to here.
<P><B>10 - Blacksmith Room:</B> In this room you will find 3 Kly and either the 
<A href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Blacksmith">Undead 
Blacksmith</A> or the <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#CPKeeper">Coerced 
Penkeeper</A>. Also in this room you can find the third journal entry, <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Day49">Day 49</A>.
<P><B>11 - Coffin Room:</B> This room contains a coffin on the floor which has 
been removed from the wall. If you duck and walk into the red hole left behind 
you will pass through the secret door to the Overseer area. It is a one way trip 
so make sure you finish your buisness in this area before passing through.
<P><B>12 - Church:</B> This large room is the church referred to in the journal 
entries. It contains 9 Kly. A <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Imprecator">Kly 
Imprecator</A> can also spawn in here.
<P><B>13 - Pit Room:</B> The corridor just past the secret door is free of 
monsters and wanderers so this is a good place to rest before moving on. This 
room contains three Kly ready to pounce on unsuspecting adventurers.
<P><B>14 - Stair Trap:</B> To the north of these crossroads a set of stairs is 
blocked by rubble. DO NOT attempt to find a way through this blocked passage 
because you will go through into a small chamber with no way out. A guide will 
have to free you if you cannot gate/port out.
<P><B>15 - Crusader Room:</B> This small room contains a spawn point in the 
north-west corner. Several named mobs including a <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#CRev">Coerced 
Revanant</A>, a <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#CPKeeper">Coerced 
Penkeeper</A> and a <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#SCrusader">Spectral 
Crusader</A> can spawn here, along with normal Kly placeholders. The two coerced 
mobs will attack on sight but the crusader is indifferent. He is the ghost of 
Crusader Golin who is mentioned in the journal entries. He does not respond to a 
hail but will answer the following questions: 
<UL>
  <LI>What is greenmist? 
  <LI>What is the Grand Forge? 
  <LI>What is the Visceral Dagger? 
  <LI>Where is Crusader Golin? </LI></UL>Also in this room you can find the fourth 
journal entry, <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Day50">Day 50</A>.
<P><B>16 - River:</B> There are several mobs found along this river but nothing 
of importance.
<P><B>17 - Labarotaries:</B> To either side here are two laboratories. In the 
left one can spawn a <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Imprecator">Kly 
Imprecator</A>.
<P><B>18 - Forge Room:</B> This room initially contains two Kly. A short time 
after they are killed a Coerced Smith spawns. He cons indifferent and is KoS to 
the Kly. He responds to a hail and at least one question ("What is the Forge?"). 
This room also contains the Grand Forge, named "Always Works". So far the 
purpose of this forge is unknown but it is likely related to the many quests 
within the zone.
<P><B>19 - Overseer Room:</B> The final room of the dungeon contains 6 Kly and 
at the far end the <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Overseer">Kly 
Overseer</A>. Also in this room can spawn the <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Imprecator">Kly 
Imprecator</A>. I have been told the Imprecator can also spawn in one of the 
laboratories nearby, the church on this level and somewhere on Level 2 (in the 
unmapped section).
<P>The Overseer is a level 36-37 mob and is very dangerous. When he gets low on 
health he will begin to constantly use a 500 direct damage ice based spell. He 
has wiped out many level 40+ parties that were unprepared. With magic and cold 
resistance buffs he is not too bad though.<BR>The Overseer is a placeholder for 
another Kly, called simply "The Kly". He is even tougher than the Overseer and 
seems to be very rare.
<P>Directly behind the Kly Overseer is a small nook with a star printed on the 
floor. This is a teleporter that will return you to Warsliks Woods, next to the 
zone to the Crypt
<P>Also in this room you can find the fifth and last journal entry, <A 
href="http://members.iweb.net.au/~kith/Dalnir/Dalnir.htm#Day55">Day 55</A>.
<P><A name=AppA>
<H2>Appendix A: Loot!</H2>Like most of Kunark there seem to be two types of loot 
tables. Certain types of monsters can drop any item from a certain loot table. 
There are also the familiar "named" monsters which drop a common, uncommon and 
rare items.
<P><B>Kly:</B> Kly can drop any item from the following list. It is currently 
uncomfirmed wether all types of Kly can drop all items of this list.

each piece of cresent drops of a particular type of Kly. The following list 
shows which Kly drop which cresent:
<P>Evoker: Cresent Slippers<BR>Cohort: Cresent Gi<BR>Acolyte: Cresent

<P>If you find contradictory evidence to this let me know and I'll go back to 
the random Kly theory ;-)
<P><A name=LGoo><B>Lumpy Goo:</B> There are two versions of the lumpy goo. The 
Rug Lumpy spawns near the fire and two rugs (marked <B>R</B>) and drops a skull, 
FS short sword and a note as its common drop. The Fighting Baton is its rare 
drop. If it is crushing rather than slashing it has the baton.<BR>The Thistle 
Lumpy spawns in the first cave between the Pool room and the tunnels. It's 
common drop is an FS spear and it's rare is the practice sword. If it slashes 
then it has the sword (It may also have a thistle shield).

      caught and tortured<BR>turned out to be genuine tink. Unfortunately 
      we<BR>must rest and plan our route into the depths of<BR>this beast. It is 
      filled with very dangerous<BR>creatures. hopefully we can overcome the 
      odds<BR>and find the final resting place of the Visceral<BR>Dagger and the 
      Grand Forge.<BR></I></A>

      <H3>Journal Entry 2 - Day 48</H3><I>Day 48 Blast! this IS the Crypt of 
      Dalnir. We<BR>found the entrance which had the ancient Haggle<BR>Barons 
      name upon it. How foolish of the crypt<BR>keepers. The Crypt is filled 
      with croaks from<BR>many races. They seem to be in some sort of<BR>trance 
      and far more powerful than they appear.<BR>We were about to enter the main 
      tomb when we were<BR>assaulted by the horde. Crusader golin sustained<BR>a 
      major gash on his shoulder. Before I could<BR>cauterize his wound, blood 
      flowed all over, even<BR>this entry. Tomorrow we shall try to enter<BR>the 
      main tomb.<BR></I></A>

      <H3>Journal Entry 3 - Day 49</H3><I>Day 49 Eve The gods were listening. 
      After many<BR>hours of hiding, it appears the beasts have gone<BR>to 
      perform some sort of dafj ritual in the<BR>church we found earlier. I 
      could hear the<BR>screams of a sacrafice and the chant of some<BR>unknown 
      tounge. I did a reconnaissance of this<BR>level and found no way out. The 
      walls had tombs<BR>built into them as morturaries do. None of the<BR>doors 
      would open, but I did find one. I slid the<BR>sarcophagus out with much 
      effort. Before I could<BR>attempt to open it I was scared off by 
      noises<BR>within the drawer.<BR></I></A>

      <H3>Journal Entry 4 - Day 50</H3><I>Day 50 What have I gotten myself into. 
      Soon I<BR>shall be dead. After finding the secret passage<BR>through the 
      drawer, I found myself in a pit of<BR>evil. I crept through the shadows 
      and came upon<BR>a locked door. I am no rogue. The door opened and<BR>a 
      beast walked out. I spied the Grand Forge!<BR>Perhaps also, a way to 
      escape this madness<BR>There must be a key around here somewhere. On 
      the<BR>beasts perhaps. Even fragments which I could<BR>piece together 
      would do. I shall have to face<BR>great evil once more. Gods be with me 
      once more.<BR></I></A>

      <H3>Journal Entry 5 - Day 55</H3><I>Day 55 I have made way past many 
      locked doors and<BR>I have encountered great hordes of evil. The<BR>forge 
      is here. Unfortunately I have learned that<BR>the dagger is fragmented in 
      the crypt. I lost<BR>much in here. My good friend and along with 
      him<BR>the shard which may be a piece to a larger<BR>puzzle, the khukri, 
      Greenmist. I could never get<BR>that back. I would need to speak with the 
      Brood<BR>and obtain a Crusader Coffin. But should I<BR>return to Cabilis 
      without the dagger, Qyzar would<BR>torture me. No! Here shall be my last 
      stand!<BR></I></A>

      <H3>a tattered memo - Day 55</H3><PRE>Day 55                      I</PRE>have happened upon the Crypt of 
      Dalnir. His<BR>Grand Forge is near, I can feel it. I have 
      also<BR>discovered a segment of a staff. It shows sign<BR>of Iksar 
      craftmanship, but of the age of Atrebe.<BR>I know the other part must be 
      here. It would<BR>fetch heavy 
coin.<BR></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DD></BODY></HTML>
