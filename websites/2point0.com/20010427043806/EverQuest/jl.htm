Once again, we hope to raise more than 10 bubbles of experience for needy char's between the levels of 35 and 45!  Come join us in the spacious Queen's Hotel situated in the luxurious caverns of the glorious Crystal Caves.  (Plenty of free parking in the Eastern Wastes!)  This year we are hoping for some REALLY good guest MC’s (who, it just so happens, had finished a previous engagement here, just a few weekends ago).
Balthus Ironwolf – Just finished filming the sequel: Faries The 13th – The Revenge! And the lovely Stillness (who just topped the charts with her latest album “Mezz Me, Charm You.”)
<p>This year's Telethon will include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Phones manned by Web Masters guild of Crystal Caverns</li>
  <li>The Ry'Gor Orc-Pull-Polka featuring the Ry'Gor all brass band!</li>
  <li>Special guest web appearance by The Queen herself!</li>
</ul>
