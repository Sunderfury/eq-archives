                    quite as fortuneate and are waiting for the final to be released 
                    there is no doubt that you have thought to yourself, &quot;Self, 
                    what race and class am I going to play?&quot; You know you 
                    don't want to have to try out every combination before you 
                    find a race/class that is &quot;you&quot;. This is where this

                    This editorial will hopefully help you figure out what class/race

                    everquest. Although this editorial is focused around helping 
                    you choose your first character, if you're an experienced

                    without ever having played the game or haveing seen it played 
                    is like trying to pick a pair of matching socks out of a drawer 
                    in the dark. You usually know what type of socks you have 
                    but there's no way of knowing for sure if you're getting the 
                    right ones. Hopefully this editorial should group your socks

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I can 
                    remember when I first started to think about what class I 
                    was going to play. I figured the best place to start was one 
                    of the major Everquest websites. I went to EQSS and EQVault 
                    and quickly fell in love with their class guides. I'd sit 
                    in front of the computer screen for hours reading the guides 
                    and trying to decide which class to play. There was only one 
                    problem: Each class guide was bias, they all said that their 
                    perticular class was the best. I'd read a class guide for 
                    the monk which said that in higher levels the monk had no 
                    equal in fighting ability and then I read another that said 
                    the rogue was never be messed with. I began to think that 
                    it was all a conspiracy to confuse me and I'd never figure 
                    it out. Thankfully, I was wrong.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="2" color="#FFCC00">A 
                    Golden Needle In a Haystack - Don't Poke Yourself<br>
                    </font></b><font size="2">My many dedicated hours to searching 
                    for the perfect character finally led me to some unbias information. 
                    Raw statistics, immensely hard to find during the beta test 
                    of any game, but I found them because of the NDA (non disclosure 
                    agreement). Any raw statistics had to be obtained through 
                    989 and then organized into some fashion that was user-friendly.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It seemed 
                    like a dream come true. It was a list of all the races and 
                    their classes with statistics. It not only had the raw statistics 
                    but it showed a class selection index for each class under 
                    each race. The class selection index was a number what measured 
                    how &quot;good&quot; the class was in relation to the race. 
                    So it seemed easy enough, find the class with the highest 
                    selection index and abracadabra, you've got the best race 
                    and class, right? WRONG!<br>
                    <font size="1">(<a href="/races/claover.html">The information 
                    I am refering to can be found here</a>) </font> </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It took 
                    me a while but I realized that it wasn't quite so easy. I 
                    had wrongly choosen to be a Ogre Warrior because it had a 
                    selection index of 114.3 which was far above any other selection 
                    index in the game. There were a couple of problems with this; 
                    1) Ogres are EVIL. They like to munch on the small insignificant 
                    humies. This fact destroyed any posibility of me every grouping 
                    up with anything else that's not evil. It is true that Chrisma 
                    will get higher if Ogres kill evil things and they will eventually 
                    be accepted into society but they are never treated quite 
                    the same. The second reason? I'm not an Ogre type of person. 
                    I like to be honorable, well groomed, charming and I like 
                    to have a sense of humor. Can you imagine an ogre doing stand-up 
                    comedy?!?<br>
                    <br>
                    -&quot;Der wuz once dis man and he did walk in a bar ... Ouch...&quot; 
                    <br>
                    -Silence from the crowd. <br>
                    -&quot;Whut? You no laugh? You no LAUGH?!?! Now Thug-Thug 
                    angry. Now Thug-Thug bash heads!&quot; <br>
                    -Next day in the news: &quot;Crowd at comedy house killed 
                    by ogre&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    I hope you can see my point. I recognized the raw information 
                    as a good source but I knew I'd need more to base my opinion 
                    on. So my quest continued.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#FFCC00">The 
                    Board, The Journal And The Decision<br>
                    </font></b>The next stop on my neverending journey was to 
                    a message board. I again thought to myself, &quot;Self, why 
                    not ask people that are actually playing the game?&quot; I 
                    posted a message simply asked &quot;What is the best race/class 
                    combination in everquest?&quot; I got one reply that simply 
                    answered &quot;There is none.&quot; I sent the writer of my 
                    reply an e-mail because it confused me more than I ever thought 
                    I could have been. I asked him why there was no best race/class 
                    combination. He replied and said that it all depended on personal 
                    taste. The question he posed to be was this, &quot;If you 
                    lived in Norrath what do you see yourself as being?&quot; 
                    The answer to this didn't seem very clear to me so I went 
                    back to the class guides I had been looking at earlier.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I read 
                    them again in a new light, &quot;Which one sounds like me?&quot;. 
                    My decision was a toss up between the Paladin and the Monk. 
                    To come to this conclusion I had to think about which one 
                    I could roleplay the best and I also had to take into account 
                    the advantages and disadvantages of each race/class. I didn't 
                    want to play a character that was heavily dependent on magic 
                    because that's not my style. I like to take problems head 
                    on rather than from a distance, like with spells. The paladin 
                    was a &quot;tank&quot; type character in battle and yet still 
                    very honorable. He also used some spells to help himself out, 
                    healing and the like. The monk didn't require any weapons 
                    and not very much armor to operate and was also a very honorable 
                    character. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This decision 
                    burned in my mind for a long time until I found a journal 
                    about a Paladin. The journal was long and chalked full of 
                    screen shots. I began reading from day one in the journal. 
                    After a couple of &quot;days&quot; of reading I decided the 
                    Paladin wasn't the one for me. Levels were very hard to gain 
                    and there seemed to be a lot of platinum required to operate 
                    a paladin because of all the weapons and armor a paladin needed 
                    to buy. I also read that the vast majority of players were 
                    paladins, and it has never been my style to conform to what 
                    everyone else is doing. Because the monk didn't require any 
                    armor or weapons and because not as many people were playing 
                    a monk I decided he would be the best choice for me.</font></p>

                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Don't 
                    choose you character simply because you think that it is better 
                    than any other character in the game because it's NOT! 989 
                    Studios has done an EXCELLENT job of balanceing the game so 
                    that no one character can be better than another. It is true 
                    that some characters will work better alone than others, but 
                    most of the time those characters aren't as great an asset 
                    to a group wereas the weaker solo classes will find groups 
                    paying them to join-up.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The key 
                    to choosing your character is to find yourself in that character. 
                    Are you the type of person who used to be sent to the principles 
                    office almost every day when you were in grade school because 
                    of beating up on your peers? If that sounds like you, you're 
                    probably an ogre or a troll. Be a paladin with that type of 
                    personality and I can assure you that you won't enjoy it as 
                    much as you could be.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am not 
                    saying that you shouldn't look at the raw data and use that 
                    to help you make your decision; the raw data is sometimes 
                    one of the best sources for completeing your decision. If 
                    you really want to be a wizard but you don't know wether to 
                    be a Human Wizard or a Erudite Wizard look at the statistics. 
                    If you like to have nothing to do with fighting and you just 
                    want to cast spells be a Erudite Wizard if you like to be 
                    slightly more &quot;rounded&quot; be a Human Wizard. However 
                    this is not always the case. For instance... A Barbarian Warrior 
                    can't/shouldn't be played the same as a Human Warrior. Barbarians 
                    are less accepted into society whereas humans ARE society 
                    thus a Barbarian would prefer to travel alone and a Human 
                    would prefer to travel with other players.</font></p>

                    you can find. If you're happy with you're character you'll 
                    have more fun, and the point of the game is to have fun &quot;Right? 
                    Of course right!&quot; With that final thought I'll leave
