                    - What is it?</b></font> <br>
                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Roleplaying 
                    is a strange thing. It is not as obscure and vague in its 
                    meaning as some people would have (and prefer for their own 
                    advantages) you believe, but it is still a tough concept to 
                    describe. It is one of those things where everyone has his 
                    or her own view on it, like time management, and only a few 
                    people out of a big crowd share the same opinion on how it 
                    should be done.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
                    basic ideal behind roleplaying is a relatively simple thing 
                    to understand. The basic operating concept of roleplay is 
                    a person takes on the persona of another person who could 
                    be totally fictional, or the fictional rendition of a real 
                    life character. That is the core idea that makes roleplay 
                    function. Yet it is this idea that gives rise to the questions 
                    and obscurities that make roleplaying seem so vague.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">That 
                    said, the main concept that is the action of actually roleplaying 
                    is a very tricky subject. What exactly is roleplaying? The 
                    core concept of roleplay is easily understood, but that does 
                    little to describe the actual act of roleplay and roleplaying. 
                    This is where views on the entire subject diverge, and where 
                    the most debate occurs.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Some 
                    people define roleplaying by its core concept, which is simply 
                    to take on the persona of a character and play that character 
                    based on its views and environment. The simplest version of 
                    roleplaying and definitely the most direct, this approach 
                    is the easiest to understand and its broadness lends a wide 
                    range of options for any roleplayer.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Other 
                    broad though slightly constricted views of roleplaying tend 
                    to impose certain limitations on the concept that people may 
                    or may not agree with. Some people think that the only way 
                    to truly roleplay is to truly act the part of the character, 
                    and that not doing so makes you a &quot;bad roleplayer,&quot; 
                    a &quot;wannabe roleplayer,&quot; or simply &quot;a newbie,&quot; 
                    despite your level in the game. These people are among the 
                    many groups who attempt to impose their views of roleplaying 
                    upon you and everyone else in the game. Through &quot;acting,&quot; 
                    they claim that they are &quot;real players&quot; and, therefore, 
                    to be a &quot;real player,&quot; you have to be like them.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                    are views of roleplaying that people use to attempt to define 
                    how certain games are played. One of the biggest and most 
                    controversial issues in Ultima Online and Diablo was whether 
                    or not player killing (and in Diablo, cheating as well) was 
                    roleplaying. Some people accused mainstream player killing 
                    of being either hate based attacks or random bullying of obviously 
                    weak players for enjoyment. In my personal opinion, it was 
                    random bullying. I have never seen a &quot;true&quot; player 
                    killer cite a racial, ethical, or political reason for attacking. 
                    The hate based attack reason is the result of paranoia on 
                    the part of people who are repeatedly player killed and people 
                    who want to incite a lynch mob against the player killing 
                    community as a whole. These people feel roleplaying is roleplaying 
                    as long as it conforms to their views of playing the game. 
                    Although similar to the group mentioned above, these groups 
                    attempt to tell people how the game is played, while the one 
                    in the previous paragraph attempts to frame what the act of 
                    roleplaying actually is.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">However, 
                    just because those accusations are wrong doesn't make player 
                    killing &quot;roleplaying&quot;. Both player killers of great 
                    repute and obscurity alike maintain, despite simple and obvious 
                    facts, that player killing is roleplaying when given &quot;a 
                    reason.&quot; This weak explanation merely generated a new 
                    step to player killing: the excuse for doing it. The excuses 
                    that &quot;I am roleplaying my character by killing you,&quot; 
                    &quot;this is an ambush, prepare to die,&quot; or &quot;we 
                    are murderers here to kill you and take your money,&quot; 
                    are not examples of roleplaying. The first is an excuse, plain 
                    and simple. Claiming that part of roleplaying is killing &quot;you,&quot; 
                    especially when the odds are this person doesn't know &quot;you,&quot; 
                    is just an excuse to kill you while attempting to make you 
                    think that their roleplaying is the way the game is played. 
                    The second excuse about the ambush is just about as superfluous 
                    as the first, making the victims think that the killing was 
                    specifically planned against them, hence creating the illusion 
                    of roleplaying to them. The third reason just doesn't make 
                    sense. First, murderers don't kill just to take your money, 
                    brigands and cutthroats and rogues do. Roleplaying a &quot;true&quot; 
                    murderer is much more complex than that, necessitating the 
                    planning out of the killing, a motive, and a method. Secondly, 
                    this killing is random, and even rogues and cutthroats and 
                    brigands aren't that random, only attacking those who appear 
                    to have a lot in the way of wealth and physical vulnerability 
                    to make the whole thing worth the effort. This type of random 
                    killing is manslaughter, nothing more and nothing less, and 
                    there is no roleplay value in this. I know I will get e-mails 
                    about this paragraph, mostly accusing me of hypocrisy by saying 
                    that player killing is not roleplaying and that what has been 
                    written is biased and opinionated. Everything in this paragraph 
                    is factual. Roleplayed killing does exist, but player killing 
                    is certainly not it. Pirates are roleplayers. Raiders are 
                    roleplayers. Murderers are roleplayers. Rogues are roleplayers. 
                    Player killers are not roleplayers. They are random killers 
                    who use roleplaying as an illusion in order to hide their 
                    fun at other peoples' expense. Don't confuse it with the real 
                    thing.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There 
                    are several other definitions of roleplaying, too numerous 
                    to mention here, but they all generally fall into the types 
                    previously mentioned. The closest you can get to defining 
                    the actual meaning of roleplaying is to use the basic idea, 
                    that roleplaying is taking on the role of a character. Beyond 
                    that, with all the varied opinions, it is impossible to pinpoint 
                    what the exact meaning of roleplaying is, because beyond the 
                    core concept, it is basically a matter of opinion.</font>

                    - What do you do in roleplaying?</b></font> <br>
                    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                    part you play in roleplaying is comparatively small in contrast 
                    to the big picture. I mean, you only provide the background, 
                    the views, the beliefs, the personality, the appearance (to 
                    a limited degree), the mannerisms, the vocal accent, and everything 
                    else that is your character(s). Now, that is an awful lot 
                    of work. Thank god Verant didn't allow us to customize the 
                    exact shade of hair color we have, the location of every crease 
                    and wrinkle on our bodies, and the size and shape of our fingernails, 
                    along with the entire myriad of things I didn't mention! Another 
                    new game would be out before we finished with our first character. 
                    But seriously now, besides maintaining your character's being 
                    (i.e. not lapsing into k00l d00d mode or real life mode) within 
                    the game, what more to roleplaying is there?</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Plenty. 
                    Roleplaying isn't just you. Roleplaying is a group effort. 
                    Some people will argue with me here, saying, &quot;well, in 
                    Final Fantasy 7 I roleplay, and all by my very lonesome without 
                    any other people.&quot; That type of roleplaying is roleplaying, 
                    but not the type I am speaking of here. The roleplaying I 
                    am talking about is the type of roleplaying that is needed 
                    to make a game of such a scale as EverQuest work. This is 
                    the type of roleplaying that the lack thereof is currently 
                    in the process of killing Ultima Online. If roleplaying had 
                    taken root in that game, and stuck, I probably would still 
                    be playing it as I write this. I am one of the many Ultima 
                    addicts out there who are sorry to see Origin's work plagued 
                    by both their faults (the constant bugs) and ours (those of 
                    us who are too immature to play a game of that scale). Ultima 
                    Online was destined for greatness when it was conceived, but 
                    that destiny ended the moment it was rushed to the assembly 
                    lines and the first social degenerate logged in. From there, 
                    it went downhill. A have long since bid adieu to the idea 
                    of staying in Ultima Online until its last days. She had her 
                    problems, but I knew her well.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But I 
                    learned long ago not to dwell on the past. What's done is 
                    done. The future, EverQuest, is what must be the focus of 
                    concentration now. EverQuest has been done better than its 
                    predecessors, and some of its contemporaries. It can be called 
                    a large MUD (Multi User Dungeon), but it is really much more. 
                    A living breathing world, like Brittania should have been, 
                    and even more than that. Its incomplete. More land is going 
                    to be added in the form of the missing continents, new worlds, 
                    and new dimensions that have only been told of in legends. 
                    New classes and races are in the process of being planned 
                    (or being held back for expansions). MUD tricks, such as the 
                    name filter which ensures people name themselves names that 
                    conform with &quot;high fantasy&quot; (to prevent Norrath 
                    from ever seeing &quot;Duke Butthead&quot; and &quot;Sir Beavis&quot; 
                    taint its soil with their foul beings) and which guarantee 
                    that no two people share the same name (to make sure nobody 
                    can impersonate others and keep identity confusion minimum), 
                    greatly reduce some of the problems that other ORPGs have 
                    faced, and help to clarify what roleplaying is. The random 
                    name generator, for example, can show people what names in 
                    Norrath should be, as opposed to the alternative.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Roleplaying 
                    is more than tricks to ensure what people name themselves. 
                    It is what gives a game such as EverQuest is continuity. As 
                    I said before, the roleplaying I am advocating here is a group 
                    effort. For it to work completely, everyone must chip in their 
                    bit. The part you play is small, but when in conjunction with 
                    others, the sum is much more than the part. Imagine a town 
                    in Norrath with everyone asking about the Clinton-Lewinsky 
                    scandal. Any attempt at roleplaying is ignored in favor of 
                    the issue debates and discussions. The political views you 
                    find might be interesting, but unless you are a politician, 
                    a critic, or an MSNBC (or other network) press member, the 
                    experience is not entirely fulfilling. In fact, the experience 
                    is just plain not fun. On the other hand, imagine a town where 
                    everywhere, you see roleplaying happening in all its ORPG 
                    forms. People conversing about their adventures into the mountains 
                    or their journey into the gnoll lair. Consumers and merchants 
                    haggling over the prices of character made goods. Bards plying 
                    their stock and trade singing on street corners. Comrades 
                    having drinks in a local tavern, and then stumbling into the 
                    street drunk and dumb as a donkies, muttering obscenities 
                    and getting berated by both players and NPCs alike. What happens 
                    if someone mentions the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal? Someone 
                    might say &quot;Sorry milord, but methinks ye be mad. Who 
                    be this Clinton and Lewinsky sir?&quot; or it might be ignored 
                    entirely. THAT is what roleplaying culminate in. It is up 
                    to you to do your part and make that vision a reality, simply 
                    because it will make the experience so much richer not only 
                    for yourself but your fellow player as well. And you stand 
                    a chance of touching those who would ruin it for everyone 
                    else, and getting them to realize it is much more fun to play 
                    along than ask about the Rangers game or the president's trial. 
                    That is what roleplaying is all about: playing along and having 
                    fun.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately, 
                    not everyone will play along. These are among the aforementioned 
                    &quot;Duke Butthead&quot; and &quot;Sir Beavis&quot; players 
                    who go around acting like their real life television namesakes 
                    and annoying people. Some people would classify power gamers 
                    among these two, but in my opinion, power gamers are roleplayers. 
                    They want money, power, and like fighting a lot. Well, wanting 
                    money, power, and liking to fight a lot is a form of roleplaying. 
                    Its simple - I mean those things are not very depth intensive 
                    - but it is roleplaying as long as they keep it in context 
                    with the game and leave real life out of it. Back to &quot;Beavis&quot; 
                    and &quot;Butthead,&quot; these two will ruin the game for 
                    anyone. Inadvertantly or intentionally, these two will not 
                    roleplay - beyond acting like imbeciles - much if at all. 
                    They will go through town using modern ebonics as opposed 
                    to the regular or old english roleplayers will opt towards, 
                    mentioning things that, as far as Norrath is concerned, do 
                    not exist, and generally inspiring players to abandon their 
                    roleplaying long enough to verbally attack them, which further 
                    damages continuity and ruins the game for more people. This 
                    is how fragile roleplaying is. It only takes one (in this 
                    case, two are the cause, but not necessary) to ruin it. That 
                    is why you must do your part to maintain the flow of things 
                    on your end. You can't control, and therefore make up for, 
                    the acts of others, but you can keep yours in control, and 
                    save some of the roleplaying flow. But rest assured that, 
                    somewhere, there is someone who is ruining it for people. 
                    You WILL meet people like this, and you have to be prepared 
                    for it, or else you might find your own experience ruined.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
                    example of the fragility of roleplaying is how human error, 
                    which is unintentional, can have the same effect. All the 
                    races in Norrath are relatively the same, having similar levels 
                    of sophistication and civilization, right? WRONG! Two races, 
                    the troll and the ogre, (not to mention anything similar that 
                    Verant might have ready for expansions) are dumber than stones 
                    (one moreso than the other, but that makes no difference here). 
                    Now, lets say we have a troll whose name is &quot;Burp.&quot; 
                    Burp goes through his troll town, smashing things, dropping 
                    pieces of his latest meal from his relatively unkempt body, 
                    grunting at passing trolls as he walks by. His days consist 
                    of smashing things, eating them, and hiding under bridges 
                    waiting to capture some billy goats gruff. :) That is a character 
                    with a good roleplaying scheme. Trolls are simplistic creatures. 
                    Rude and obnoxious, they are hardly civilized (they are a 
                    civilization, however), and they are smarter than ogres! Imagine 
                    what an ogre's routine might be! Now, lets say we have a troll 
                    whose name is &quot;Johnas&quot;. Johnas goes through his 
                    troll town, being careful not to hurt anything, his personal 
                    cleanliness in stark contrast with his surroundings, bidding 
                    fond &quot;how do you do's&quot; to other trolls as he walks 
                    by. His days consist of helping the poor, giving people food 
                    and drink and healing concoctions, and having detailed debates 
                    about the politics of Norrathian nobles. Roleplayers will 
                    look at this character and get either extremely frustrated 
                    or extremely angry. Trolls are stupid. They are supposed to 
                    act that way. A troll, or worse, an ogre, asking for some 
                    grey poupon, is definitely against the image of those races. 
                    This type of &quot;affront&quot; as some will regard it is, 
                    in my personal opinion, not intentional (generally). It has 
                    to be hard acting &quot;dumb&quot; for some people. Others 
                    will do this because they are like Beavis and Butthead: they 
                    have no clue. And still others will do this to ruin the experience. 
                    But in general, it will be human error. Whatever the cause, 
                    however, I expect to see at least one ogre with unusually 
                    high communicative skills in Norrath. Do that player a favor: 
                    don't bust his/her chops. Ignore it, and if you feel like 
                    helping people out, try sending a private message to it saying 
                    that what it is doing is not in context (don't use the word 
                    &quot;wrong,&quot; as it is harsh and direct and makes people 
                    think you are trying to tell them what to do) and explaining 
                    how one of its race usually acts. You have done your good 
                    deed for the day, preserved the flow of roleplaying, and hopefully 
                    done someone a favor by enlightening him/her as to a way to 
                    make the experience fuller for themselves and others.</font> 
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As long 
                    as you maintain your role, the experience will at least remain 
                    somewhat saved. But your role, although small, is still very 
                    significant. You help make the whole thing work. Remember 
                    the comparison between the roleplay town and the Clinton-Lewinsky 
                    town. If you play your part, you might inspire others to roleplay 
                    and forget about what has no place in Norrath, making roleplay 
                    succeed and the only responses to the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal 
                    something to the affect of, &quot;I know not what ye speak
