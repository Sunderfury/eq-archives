                    of a "Girl Gamer"</font></b><br>
                    I admit it. I was going crazy waiting for EverQuest to begin. 
                    No game since Warcraft II has inspired me to make as big a 
                    flurry of system upgrades and frantic Internet searched for 
                    the slightest breath of rumor as this one. Although Online 
                    Role Playing Games (OLRPGs for brevity) have burned me in 
                    the past, I still anticipated this ones release with excruciating 
                    anxiety.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Why did 
                    I find myself checking my email every four hours for the mystic 
                    "second email" that would announce the beginning steps for 
                    the open 4th phase of beta? Why did I torment myself like 
                    this? The answer is simple. I see in Everquest many of the 
                    things that I have hoped for ages in an OLRPG.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I realize 
                    that my opinion of what makes a good OLRPG differs from that 
                    of some. I would hope that most Role Players would tend to 
                    agree that Everquest promises to deliver most, if not all, 
                    of the things we have dreamed for since we first plunked a 
                    quarter in the slot, picked up a gamepad, clicked a mouse 
                    or rolled the gaming dice.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Since 
                    my early arcade days I have lusted for eye candy. Great graphics 
                    beat great gameplay almost everytime. The exception was the 
                    Atari 2600. I still hold a soft spot in my heart for the clunky 
                    4 bit graphics of "Combat". I could probably still fire up 
                    my old 2600 console and play the Combat games until I finally 
                    had to stop because of bugged out eyes, numb thumbs, and a 
                    severe case of "Gamers&quot; Butt" (that numb, tingly feeling 
                    in your backside after 5-6 hours of consecutive play on the 
                    hard family room floor). EverQuest is definitely heavy on 
                    the eye candy.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> I admit 
                    that I was completely addicted to Ultima Online. The first 
                    time I logged in, I had such dreams of what it could be. I 
                    imagined myself as part of the world. I created a female healer, 
                    and promptly died fighting a pig. I looked at the black "You 
                    Are Dead" screen in dismay. A PIG killed me?!? Disappointed 
                    by the stupidity of the death, I learned also on that first 
                    day the enormous concentration of jerks in the game. I saw 
                    my newbie corpse looted of everything by a "Lord Shadow" He 
                    only laughed at me (as I quickly took the penalty to instant 
                    resurrect to protect my few possessions from his grasping 
                    scummy hands). He was a fast looter...too fast. I was unable 
                    to save anything except my clothes, and a pair of thigh boots 
                    I had conveniently found by the place I appeared in Britannia. 
                    I politely asked, then begged for my meager possessions back. 
                    He just laughed and said "U lam3r. U should learn the rulz. 
                    This stuff is mine now Biatch haha." I dared to mention that 
                    he was NOT role-playing his character of a "Noble Lord" very 
                    well. He just turned around and left. This of course left 
                    a bad taste in my mouth, but I thought it was an isolated 
                    incident. I was of course, wrong. I wish I had kept a record 
                    of the number of times I died. Some were to my own stupidity 
                    such as attacking a pig with my newbie healer with no combat 
                    skills and a dagger, or entering a PK infested dungeon in 
                    full gold plate. Some were the to frustrating Lag Monster. 
                    Far too many deaths were to gangs of non Role Playing Quake 
                    Kidz.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now I 
                    won't say that the Quakers aren't allowed their "fun". On 
                    the contrary, they are as entitled as I to enjoyment. However, 
                    their right to wildly swing their fists ends where my nose 
                    begins. I do not now, nor have I ever wanted to participate 
                    in PvP within the Role Playing games. If I want to "waste" 
                    other players, I do it in one of the games designed for such 
                    activity. If I have a bloodthirsty Amazon desire to see the 
                    color of my opponent's guts, I'll frag 'em in Quake. The reason 
                    is simple: those games were designed to be a humongous frag 
                    fest. Equipment is easy to come by (just walk to the nearest 
                    spawn point, and Voila! A rocket launcher). All players in 
                    Quake have equal abilities as far as their characters go. 
                    An OLRPG, however, is quite different. Getting items such 
                    as weapons and armor takes gold. Getting gold, (unless you 
                    are a bug abuser ) takes time. Nobody likes their time to 
                    be wasted. Getting Pked at the Britain crossroads in a set 
                    of chain you labored for 4 real time hours in the tailorshop 
                    for, even if you have another set safe in the bank, not only 
                    sucks the big one, it's a waste of time on top of it. The 
                    total time wasted is not only the time it takes to run back 
                    to town or to find an elusive wandering healer, but also to 
                    regain enough wealth through more tailoring, lumberjacking 
                    and mining to replace the goods lost. This may be why so many 
                    turned to the way of the PK. No "monster" holds more loot 
                    than other players. For some, the challenge of beating other 
                    players is the biggest thrill in the game. For me, it's not. 
                    I don't know whether my feminine point of view makes me different, 
                    or if it is a personal ethic. I never cared for Pking in OLRPGS. 
                    All I have to do is think of how crushed I was when I was 
                    looted of almost everything I had on my newbie healer character. 
                    I cannot do that to another person.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Sure, 
                    there ARE role playing evil PKs, but they are so few in my 
                    real experience. Believe me, I experienced PKs over...and 
                    over...and over. The only PK death that did not leave me feeling 
                    violated was one that I actually sought after a fashion. I 
                    had decided to meet the roleplaying Drow of Catskills. I roleplayed 
                    a Paladin who had come to reclaim the Crypts of Yew for the 
                    light. I died valiantly (some may say foolishly) trying to 
                    do just that...alone! But it was the best time I ever had 
                    dying! </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most PKs 
                    in UO (and other OLRPGs) kill you silently, or with a Psudo-Ebonic 
                    taunt such as the ever popular "Suk it Biatttttcccccchh!" 
                    or the eloquently simple "U sux!" I never understood why the 
                    youngsters whose mommies and daddies can afford a computer 
                    fast enough to play UO, plus the $10 a month would have not 
                    been taught proper English by their parents. Many things in 
                    this world continue to amaze me</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> The difference 
                    lies in whether you are "killing" the character or the player. 
                    Actions intended to harass, anger or hurt the player behind 
                    the monitor, rather than the one onscreen are the ones the 
                    PK switch are intended to prevent. Recently, in my insanity 
                    induced by waiting for EQ, I reactivated my UO account. Dusting 
                    off my now master healer character, I set out to roleplay 
                    my healer gal to the hilt. What I encountered in my first 
                    hour back amongst the Britannians made me regret reopening 
                    my account.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> As I 
                    was walking to the bank from the tailor shop, I ran into a

                    had named his character after the last HBO movie he'd seen. 
                    From half a screen away, he was "miner shuffling" his stack 
                    of 136 hides to the provisioner. Walking a few steps ahead 
                    of the hides, he would pick them up and drop them a few steps 
                    ahead of him. This way, he could move an obscenely large amount 
                    of material relatively quickly. Problem is, he became quite 
                    paranoid while doing this. "bite me" he yelled at me in lower 
                    case halfway across his screen. Wanting to know if he was 
                    perhaps a sadomasochist in need of assistance, I walked up 
                    to him. "go away you whore. these are mine. I see u trying 
                    to take em." Of course, this amount of hides would take me 
                    a few hours to gather, but I had no intention of taking his 
                    hides. After all, they wouldn't fit in my pack either, and 
                    I would only have to miner shuffle them too. None too impressed 
                    with his grammatical skills, I decided to teach the boy some 
                    manners. "There is no need to be rude. I wasn't anywhere near 
                    you when you said 'bite me'." He just laughed and started 
                    making rude and obscene comments and gestures with his bowing 
                    motion to a male passerby. He also continued the verbal onslaught 
                    to the point where I was forced to page a GM for harassment. 
                    Sure, I could have walked away, but he would only renew his 
                    totally inappropriate behavior with the next female character 
                    who came within half a screen of him.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In EQ, 
                    there is a blessing known as the Holy Ignore Feature. With 
                    this feature, the inbred gits we all hate are divinely rendered 
                    blissfully silent, at least to those who choose to use the 
                    option. No more need to put up with trash talking 12 year 
                    olds with an expensive toy and a phone line.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Now that 
                    the phase 4 beta has started, I have been immersing myself 
                    in the the game. Only once have I met a rude person. I saw 
                    a mage in trouble with an orc pawn. Even if the /con (consider) 
                    of these beasts show you have the upper hand, they can pull 
                    a few tricks on you and have you seeing the yellow "You have 
                    been slain by an Orc Pawn" and "LOADING. Please Wait" at the 
                    bottom of your screen. So, being helpful, and seeing that 
                    even if I did the rest of the damage on the orc, the mage 
                    would get all the experience and be able to loot the corpse, 
                    I threw in a few sword whacks. Seeing my female form, he called 
                    me a slut for this, even though I was only trying to help 
                    him. He was pretty badly hurt when I found him. I suppose 
                    I should have just let him die.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My hope 
                    is that the interface of EverQuest will allow for true roleplaying. 
                    Being able to TRUELY ignore those who choose to harass, annoy 
                    and be all around asses will make this much easier than in 
                    UO. The PK switch may make this game less attractive to those 
                    who like to have fun at the expense of others, while still 
                    allowing those who truly wish to roleplay killers and thieves 
                    to do so...with much needed penalties for living on the dark 
                    side. Although there are some features of UO I will miss (such 
                    as the ability to afford and actually wear plate!) I think 
                    I might join the ever growing group of EverQuest converts. 
                    See you in EQ! <br>
