    <td width="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp; The bright glow of the Xystran moons filled the
      square as Lilan slowly walked home, smiling to herself with pride. It had
      been a difficult task for her parents to convince the village elders to
      teach her the secrets of her people, the arcane mysteries which had saved
      her kind so long ago. She couldn't believe her happiness, though; just two
      years ago she had wished for death at the thought of being enrolled in
      such a boring, forgotten field of study. Now she smiled at the thought of
      doing well. <em>Unbelievable</em>, she thought.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp; She was so lost in thought she barely noticed the
      shrill wind echoing in her ears. Her footing followed the familiar path,
      even though she was barely conscious of the stones beneath her feet. She
      daydreamed, smiling to herself occasionally, ignorant of the outside
      world. She was so engrossed in her thoughts that she didn't realize how
      sleepy and tired she was getting... Her steps slowed and became awkward,
      her head became heavy as her breathing became deeper. She was having
      trouble keeping her eyes open until the first pains of nausea swept over
      her. Her eyes shot open in icy panic.</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp; She could barely move, let alone struggle, as she
      was lifted off the ground. It felt like some powerful hand gripped her,
      squeezing her neck, choking her, as she coughed and wheezed for breath.
      The pain moved down her back, along her spine, as she darted her eyes back
      and forth to clear her clouded head. She saw whirls of color racing past
      her downwards, blots of light and dark plummeting below. Tears streamed
      from her eyes to be swept away in the torrent of wind as she hurtled to
      ... where? <em>What is this? Why is it doing this to me?</em></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp; Blackness, emptiness, soothed and consoled her.
      The void of nothingness, where no pain, no anxiety, reached her. Slowly
      the darkness took shape, blurring into a dull grey image, and Lilan became
      aware of the first sounds to reach her since the ordeal had begun. It came
      rushing back in bits and pieces; each new noise and new blurry, confused
      image that pierced her mind brought a flash of the painful memory back.
      But where was she going when <em>it</em> happened? What was she doing? She
      could not recall so many things for some reason, and she had no idea how
      much time had passed....</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp; She became aware of how cold her face was. Cold
      and sore. She cracked her eyelids open to reveal a dark stone before her,
      against the side of her cheek. As she blinked to focus she became acutely
      aware of the scent of incense and the stench of burnt flesh. <em>What is
      this?</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Arise, servant!&quot; shrieked an odd voice. Lilan
      summoned the strength to lift her head and gazed at the source. It was an
      odd creature, thin, pale, and wrinkled... &quot;In accordance with the
      Rituals, I bring thee forth to do my bidding!&quot; It had no hair on its
      head, but only a thin few strands along the sides of its head, which was
      so obscene... There were no horns! No scales or plates, only a grossly
      smooth, tan skin. Lilan shuddered in horror as she looked into the thing's
      eyes, which blinked in fury. <em>It has round pupils...</em> she thought
      in disgust as it spoke again. &quot;Zsikthian Demon, I bring you forth on
      this plane to do my bidding for a term of no less than 24 hours!&quot; <em>This
      was going to be a long day...</em></td>
