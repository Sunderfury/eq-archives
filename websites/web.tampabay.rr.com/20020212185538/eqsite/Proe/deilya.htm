      Deilya was orphaned as a child; her parents were viciously killed by the
      Crushbone Orcs, a fact that has burned a hatred of Orcs into her soul.&nbsp;
      She was taken in by a kindly Ranger who was among the force that drove
      back the orcs that day.&nbsp; Within the Faydark's Champions guild, she learned a
      love of nature, animals, Tunare, compassion towards life but a fierceness
      against her enemies.<br>
      <br>
      She was intrigued by the entertainments of Kelethin, staged by the
      Songweavers guild, and it was at one of these recitals that she met a
      young Half-Elf by the name of Daelin.&nbsp; Eventually, she came to respect the young fellow whose lust for battle seemed to
      match her own, and they began spending more and more time together.&nbsp;
      Short journeys to Ak'anon to view the frothy, wiry-haired minotaur at the
      zoo were undertaken at times, where the two would analyze the beast, looking for
      the most effective ways to fight its kind.&nbsp; From these voyages to Ak'anon, she became friends with a few gnomes, including a young Wizard
      and Cleric.&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Now that she has completed her training, she has earned the rank of a
      Ranger, and plans to undertake her crusade against the Orcs alongside her
      close companion Daelin, who has become strangely tight-lipped lately whenever he
      starts extolling the wonders of battlelust that Rallos Zek can command, as if he suddenly thinks better of the
      conversation for some
      reason.&nbsp; /shrug</font></td>
