<hr>

<p>There are fourteen player character classes available in EverQuest. When one grows and
matures in the lands of Norrath, they have a wide range of available futures, depending on
their race, aptitude with magic, innate intelligence, skill at arms, and overall
potential. </p>

<p>Not all races can be all classes, and some items are restricted as well by both race
and/or class. 

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Warrior</font> </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">A powerful adversary, this class is most skilled at the use of offensive weapons,
    various armor types, and parrying ability with shields. They have the highest &quot;Hit
    Points&quot; of any class, being a group that trains and thrives on armed combat.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Cleric</font> </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">the priests and Clerics of Norrath swear fealty to a patron Deity, and must pray
    for their abilities. They may heal the sick and injured, as well as smite foes by calling
    upon the wrath of their Deity.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Paladin</strong></em></font><font size="3">
    this class is a hybrid of a Warrior and Priest, being a holy knight in the service of
    virtue and honor. In addition to their unique powers and abilities, they share some of the
    abilities of the Warrior and Priest.&nbsp; They may use their &quot;Lay Hands&quot;
    ability once every 24 game hours.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Shadow Knight </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">much like the Paladin is the guardian of all that is holy, the Shadow Knight
    stands as the antithesis, being a bastion of evil. They serve evil Deities, and are a
    combination of the Warrior and the Necromancer, and as such use their INT as the source of
    their mana pool.&nbsp; Their &quot;Harm Touch&quot; ability can similarly be used only
    once every 24 game hours.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Ranger</font> </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">this outsdoorsman is a combination of the Warrior and the Druid. They excel at
    skills which deal with nature, such as Tracking, and are most at home on a trail in the
    forest or the like.&nbsp; Like the other &quot;hybrids&quot; (Paladin &amp; Shadow
    Knight), they gain spells at 9th level.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Druid </strong></em></font><font size="3">this
    profession has dedicated itself to the preservation of nature, which can be drawn upon to
    protect and help the Druid in times of need. It has been theorized that their innate ties
    with the animals is such that no natural animal will ever attack a Druid unless first
    attacked by that Druid, but I have yet to test this theory.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Monk</font> </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">ascetic practitioners of martial prowess, the monks stand to improve themselves
    without reliance on most armor and weapons. They see their bodies as natural weapons, and
    are fervently religious. Their gods notice this zeal and reward them and their skills.
    &nbsp; This class is limited to Humans.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Bard</strong></em></font><font size="3"> this
    musical class can hold its own in most battles, but their true skill lies in their music.
    They can weave magical effects by their charming tunes and ballads, and can keep audiences
    enthralled with their magical spells while they sing and play their chosen instrument.
    &nbsp; At each level, a Bard has one new song he or she may purchase and learn, unlike
    typical spellcasters who go by &quot;ranks&quot; every 4 levels or so.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Rogue</font> </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">this is the spy, the assassin, the pickpocket of Norrath. They can walk
    undetected in shadows, silently and efficiently killing from behind with precise blows.
    They are trained in various weapons, but must employ clandestine methods to battle a
    Warrior one-on-one, such as the coveted Backstab ability. They are also skilled at entry
    into buildings, picking pockets, and other forms of thievery.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Shaman</font> </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">this is the tribal medicine man among more &quot;primitive&quot; races and
    cultures, and employ their healing and offensive abilities in the protection of their
    tribe. They are much like a Cleric, but are supposedly slightly better combatants (of
    course, the innate ability of the larger, &quot;primitive&quot; races to &quot;Bash&quot;
    always helps).</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Necromancer</strong></em></font><font
    size="3"> this practitioner of dark magic can raise and command undead, rot an opponent's
    body, speak with the dead, and carry out other unspeakable acts.&nbsp; They are shunned by
    all societies but for the malicious Dark Elves.&nbsp; A newbie Necromancer will have a
    hard time being accepted in most cities, and will have to work hard fighting the foes of
    that city to prove himself.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Wizard</font> </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">this seeker of knowledge sees magic as the goal in and of itself, and uses pure
    magical force to damage foes. With enough experience, she can also instantly transport
    over long distances or merely view objects and scenes from great distances. Their lives
    are dedicated to the pursuit of arcane knowledge.&nbsp; No other spellcaster can harm a
    foe as quickly as the deadly Wizard.&nbsp; </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Magician</font> </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">the conjurers and summoners of Norrath, this class binds other beings to their
    will. The ability to summon minor items and food is also the province of the Magician.
    Even supernatural beings can be summoned and commanded by a powerful Magician. Like a
    Wizard, they know some offensive magical spells, but could never compete with a Wizard in
    that field.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Enchanter</font> </strong></em></font><font
    size="3">the ability to modify a weapon through magic, or the ability to beguile and charm
    a person is the province of the Enchanter. They have some directly damaging offensive
    spells as well, but not to the extent of the Wizard.&nbsp; They may also summon
    &quot;pets,&quot; but in this case, it is the enchantment of a sword and shield to protect
    the caster, or the ability to charm another being, even a foe.</font></li>
</ul>
