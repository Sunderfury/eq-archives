      Daelin grew up in Kelethin.&nbsp; His late mother was a Human Bard whose travels led her
  across the face of Norrath, and while
      studying with the Songweavers guild of the tree-city, she came to fancy a Wood Elven Warrior, a reserve member of the Guard.&nbsp; Their son, a charming and witty young half-elf, joined the Songweavers, inspired by tales his
      mother would tell him as a child, but also because he was so very moved by
      a recital by that guild -- a telling of an epic battle.&nbsp; The glory of
      combat, struggling through the strife of enemies for joyous victory:&nbsp; these
      feelings stirred a fervent passion within Daelin, whose adopted name means &quot;Warrior,&quot; and he found himself praying to Rallos Zek.<br>
  <br>
      He would break away from his studies of songs and swordsmanship
      to attend many recitals and events staged within Kelethin, most of which revolved around tales of epic heroism.&nbsp; During this period of his
      idealistic studies, he met Deilya, a lovely but troubled young Wood Elf. She
      was orphaned, he learned, thanks to the Crushbone Orcs, and they shared many a strangely intimate evening discussing combat tactics and her main goal in
  life -- the destruction of every Orc, everywhere.&nbsp; They shared many journeys of learning to Ak'anon, learning from their zoo and appreciating the Tinkering of the gnomes, and made many friends among the smaller folk, but
  journeys to Kaladim had to be undertaken only by Deilya, as the Dwarven Guards refused to allow passage to
      Daelin, because of rumors of his
  fealty to Rallos Zek.<br>
  <br>

      During his studies of lore, Daelin discovered that the Orcs claim their creator was Rallos Zek himself, and
      he&nbsp; worried that this
  fact could damage his relationship with Deilya.&nbsp; The subject,
      however, has never come up, perhaps because both of them were avoiding it.<br>
  <br>

      Now that the pair have both officially met the requirements of their trainers, teachers, and guildmasters, they travel almost exclusively
  together. Daelin seeks out the glorious conquest of battle,
      carving his destiny as a warrior poet.<br>
