      <p align="center">This guide has been developed from my experiences with 
        the trade skill of tailoring. If you find any mistakes or have anything 
        to add then mail me <a href="mailto:fleabum@hotmail.com">fleabum@hotmail.com</a> 
        and I will get it updated.</p>
      <p align="center"><b><font size="5">Other Items<br>
        </font></b><br>
        In this section I will cover various things, like type of pelt for race, 
        other tailoring items that can be created and also other items with regards 
        to tailoring like Heady Kiola's.</p>
      <p align="center"><br>
        <b>Backpack<br>
        <img src="../../graphics/backpack.gif" width="40" height="40"> </b></p>
      <div align="center"> 
        <p>Tailor made backpacks seem to weigh the same as regular backpacks (3.0) 
          but have ten slots for you to put items into. They require a backpack 
          pattern and a high quality bear skin. It is possible to begin making 
          backpacks with a 25% or so success rate at skill level 40, but I don't 
          recommend it. With High Quality Bear skins costing about 30pp failures 
          can be quite expensive. The selling price of ten slot backpacks is about 
          80-120pp. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Bonings</b><br>
          <img src="../../graphics/bonings.gif" width="40" height="40"><br>
          <br>
          These are made by combining a small brick of ore, file and flask of 
          water in a forge. Studs use the blacksmithing skill.</p>
        <p><br>
          <b>Heady Kiola</b><br>
          <img src="../../graphics/headykiola.gif" width="40" height="40"><br>
          <br>
          Cured silk armor requires a new item, which is the Heady Kiola drink, 
          this is created using the brewing skill. To create the Heady Kiola drink, 
          you need to combine two kiola saps, one water flask, and one bottle 
          in a brewers barrel. This item requires only a low skill at brewing, 
          so any tailor should be able to make them as needed. The cost to make 
          them, assuming no failures, is just under 3 gold each. Heady Kiola becomes 
          trivial at brewing skill 46. If you want to cut down on failures, I 
          suggest you max. out making bog juice as it only takes snake scales, 
          water and a bottle.</p>
        <p><br>
          <b>Quiver and Fleeting Quiver</b><br>
          <img src="../../graphics/quiver.gif" width="40" height="40"> <br>
          <br>
          The items required to make these haven't been found to my knowledge, 
          so that means there either broken or its another Verant mystery.</p>
        <p><br>
          <b>Sewing Kits</b><br>
          <img src="../../graphics/sewingkitoutside.gif" width="40" height="39"><br>
        </p>
        <table width="48%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td width="47%" height="280"> 
              <p align="center">Sewing kits come in two sizes, small and large. 
                Try and keep clear of the small sewing kit as it doesn't make 
                all the items. Just purchase the large sewing kit and be happy 
                that it can do all items. This is the most used item in tailoring, 
                well it would be, you can't tailor without it ;).</p>

          <br>
          <b>Silk Swatch</b><br>
          <img src="../../graphics/silkswatch.gif" width="40" height="40"><br>
          <br>
          These are made by combining two &quot;large&quot; type spider (i.e. 
          Large Spider, Dune Spider, Heart Spider) silks in a sewing kit. Silk 
          Swatches become trivial at skill level 17. Let it be noted though, they 
          never fail, and as such this is the best way to get your skill upto 
          17.</p>
        <p><br>
          <b>Shadow Silk</b><br>
          <img src="../../graphics/silkswatch.gif" width="40" height="40"><br>
          <br>
          These are used in various Necromancer quests. There are three types, 
          and they seem to get progressively harder to make. I am not sure of 
          the current trivial skill level of these items. All shadow silk takes 
          at least one of the following items, Shadow Wolf pelt, Silk Swatch and 
          Gather Shadows scroll.<br>

          <b>Studs</b><br>
          <img src="../../graphics/studs.gif" width="40" height="40"><br>
          <br>
          These are made by combining three metal bits (unstacked), file and flask 
          of water in a forge. Studs use the blacksmithing skill.</p>
        <p><br>
          <b>Tailor Made Whip</b><br>
          <img src="../../graphics/whip.gif" width="40" height="40"> <br>
          <br>
          A tailor made whip is a one hand slash weapon with the stats of damage 
          7 and 33 delay. To make this weapon you need a Medium Quality Wolf pelt, 
          four Heady Kiola's, and a whip pattern. The selling price is usually 
          about 10pp. There is not much call for this item as there are other 
          weapons about that are better for the same price.</p>
        <p><br>
          <b>Viscous Mana</b><br>
          <img src="../../graphics/viscousmana.gif" width="40" height="40"><br>
          <br>
          This is an enchanter only made item. It uses the 12th level enchanter 
          spell Thicken Mana, which is available in the Brownie village in Lesser 
          Faydark. Casting the spell requires the material components of a poison 
          vial and a pearl. This can be an annoying item to find, as most enchanters 
          don't bother to get the spell, as currently it is pretty limited.<br>
          <br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p align="center"><b>Wu's Fighting Gauntlets</b><br>
        <img src="../../graphics/wusgloves.jpg" width="318" height="129"><br>
        <br>
        These magical glowing silk gloves are useable by the Monk class only. 
        With AC 4, with a weight of 0.1 they are very light and strong, but they 
        also have a great boon for Humans, they give off light as a greater lightstone. 
        The recipe is a glove pattern, a swatch of silk, a greater lightstone, 
        a vial of viscous mana, and four Heady Kiola's. Assuming no failures, 
        and considering the market value of the components, these gloves cost 
        a minimum of 17 plat to make, so this makes the sale price about 40-60pp.<br>
