		    <td colspan=2 valign=top>I had been told by a fellow student at the Unseen University that the hunting in Steamfont was better than constantly sacrificing myself to Clan Crushbone, so i set out. With a few garbled directions i wandered through the Greater Faydark, and then into Lesser Faydark. This part of the woods seems much easier to navigate even in the pitch-black of night and only a few minutes went by before i arrived in Steamfont.<br>The first thing i saw was a skeleton walking towards me (have those Necromancers infested this place too?) in a very aggressive manner. I did the only sensible thing and ran. I kept to a path, passing trees and noted that in the rocky walls of this valley there appeared to be strange lights coming from the lower rocks.<br>I had to have a closer look.<br>These were no lights at all! But jets of steam (which is how the place got it's name, no doubt) coming from underground. The air was warmer around these vents, and i wondered if they would be a good place to camp overnight.<br>A scuffling noise came from behind me, and i whirled around to see a diseased, and flea-ridden rat scurry by. And then another. I looked up from the rats and noticed that the entire area seemed to be crawling with them. I shivered and decided to move in. I had no intention of getting the plague that night.<br>I wandered further into the valley, dodging strange apes who reminded me of some Barbarians i once knew...<br>Past small huts, and a myriad of switchback paths, i came upon a strange sight. A building with wings! The wings were rotating around slowly, apparently doing nothing. Certainly the building wasn't taking off.<br>Most perculiar.<br>A door! A door in the building!<br>I opened it cautiously and saw a very small figure inside, who appeared to be friendly. He introduced himself as a Gnomish Blacksmith, and although i have little interest in that profession i persuaded him to buy some small Orcish clothing in return for buying Gnome-made goods from their city. I agreed easily, i had in mind some Gnomish variant of a muffin and perhaps a beer or two...or three.<br>Stepping outside the building i ran into a fellow Student called Idaril. He explained that these winged buildings were called windmills, and that the wings made the Gnomish magiks work. He called it mechanics, but i am sure that it is their own brand of magik.<br>I followed Idaril a little way, whilst he collected his belongings from his body. Convincing me that the hunting really was good, i decided to stay for a while. I tried to look at a few of the native creatures, but my eyesight failed me. I stumbled along trying not to trip over some strange red logs on the ground in search of some flying beasts that he pointed out.<br>BAM!<br>I was hit.<br>And then i was fighting for my life. I barely glimpsed the creature in the dark, i could only see it clearly when i crafted some spells that attacked it and lit up the area for a few seconds. Such a sight i have never seen before. A creature that was half-man, half animal, and who was apparently intent on talking me as a slave.<br>I tried my hardest to battle it alone, with a few spells to stop it from moving towards me provided by Idaril, but it was too much alone. I sometimes have trouble saying the spells out loud, and this time was worse than normal. It got to the point where i could only craft the most simplistic spells, and i since am not a good fighter i got hit more frequently. For a few moments i thought that i might win, the spells have given me a good advantage, but i missed with my staff and he hit me square on as i swung back.<br>The last thing i remember was Idaril standing over me, trying to bandage my wounds.<br>Then blackness came and the pain was ended.<hr color=White></td>
