So I attack him again, and kill him when I just have about 3 pixels of health left, so I proceed up the hillside behind Mooto's tent (very slowly) about 20 seconds later I get attacked by a Shadow Wolf, I didn't think nothing of this at the time, just thought he was passing, so I kill the wolf, then another 10-15 seconds pass and another Wolf attacks me, so I con him, and he comes up as green!<br>I then wonder when has Green conned creatures attacked what is possibly a RED to them!, after a few minutes of thinking about it, I begin to realise that maybe the Wolfs sense when you are low on health so they have a pop at you as well.<br><br>So fellow adventurers beware if you have low health, hide somewhere...<hr color=White></td>

God knows how often I will use this :)<br><br>Anyway, on with the story.<br><br>I was down in the dumps after getting slapped back in time by Dragoon Zyt, the cad jumped me while I was smacking a Puma about, and he knocked so much xp off me, it took me back to lvl 10. After retrieving my corpse, I slowly wandered (sneaking and hidden - I didn't fancy getting jumped by Ol blue face in shining armour) over to a single hut by the lake side,  to where I met a monk (his name I have forgotten) and he asked if I could show him the way to High Hold Pass, now being an honest person (yeah ok I'm a rogue, go on say it, a rogue being honest!) I couldn't leave this monk on his tod in such a dangerous place, so off we went, and inside the entrance to Kithicor was a Ogre, who was also lost (yes laugh everyone who knows me, I always get lost in Kithicor) and wanted to get to HH to go to Qeynos, upon reaching the Entrance to HH, the Monk decided to reward me, which I didn't really expect to get anything except a Thank you which would have been ok, but no!  he gave me 6 Platinum Pieces, boy was I chuffed!  The Ogre just gave me a Rusty 2h sword which raised about 2 gold or so but in the end a very profitable day to which started dull!<br><br>Cyclops on the starboard side!<br><br>If you ever go to Freeport I must warn you not to travel on the East Freeport ferry service to Butchers Block, as it has to be the most boring experience ever, the trip takes a good 30-45 mins with the zone loads, and you don't see much at all.  But on one Island after passing through the 2 rock columns with the Wailing Sirens on, you might get a view of a cyclops, at first I thought it was a Hill Giant, but my excitement jumped a few levels when it turned out to be a Cyclops, sadly the ferry service does not stop there but I am wondering if it might be worth taking a small row boat out there just so I can get a close-up picture of him and add him to my gallery of pics of the Giants of Norrath.<br>"<hr color=White></td>
