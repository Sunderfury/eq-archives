								<td>
								  <ol>
								  <li>Please get as much info about where you are going before you go.  Everlore, alakazams, EQ Atlas and the 
								      Safehouse are all very good sources of information about raid zones.  A BGH is not the place to go into 
								      naked, when we are all level 60 and uber then we can consider doing that.</li>
								  <br><br>
								  <li>Rules not open to interpretation and are standard in all raids.</li>
								  <br><br>
								  <li>2 buttons should be created. /assist &lt;MAIN&gt; and /assist &lt;SECOND&gt;. These are necessary or you will get 
								      your ass chewed by enchanters. These are used at all times. Never assist off of the Puller.</li>
								  <br><br>
								  <li>Pay attention to the mob the Main assist is hailing, that is the target.  Do not hit it until they have hailed. 
								      If you lose the target then use assist to re-acquire.  You will be told when to use the Secondary assist, this 
								      is normally only if the Main assist is LD or lagging badly.</li>
								  <br>
                  <li>One person from each group checks the corpses on the mobs that they have killed.  
                      They check all mobs EXCEPT any mobs that drop their own class armour, a second person should 
                      be designated for that.  This can be decided in the group itself, convention normally states 
                      that the cleric is the main checker though.  If you do not know the zone and the possible 
                      drops, don't accept one of these positons.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>There is always someone responsible for rolling for good loot (Loot Master).  If your group 
                      get a kill the person checking tells the the person responsible for rolls and calls out the 
                      loot in /shout (or /ooc sometimes) if you have nothing, say you have nothing. Loot is randomed 
                      by loot master. This person will /shout 'Who wants in the roll for uber_weapon_01'. You then /tell 
                      them and they will add you. They will often say who can and cannot roll on an item, if you dont 
                      like it, tough.  They will produce a list; Kermit 1, Miss Piggy 2, Fozzy Bear 3, etc.  
                      Then /random 1 3 which will produce a result for the number of people who have sent tells.  
                      That person will be then told where they can loot their loot.  You do not /random 100 for loot 
                      on BGH.  You must still check you are about to loot the item you should be.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>All planar gems are normally zone lottoed.  Some times planar gems will be held by the 
                      organising guild to cover expenses such as hate stones.  Often the Puller gets his choice of 
                      any one planar gem.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>All normal gems go to the Cleric in your group.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>When you go on a BGH take with you 20 Peridots and give them to your cleric at the start of 
                      the raid.  You won't get a refund of unused Peridots at the end, you can ask for them back 
                      if you get swa[ped in groups before the raid starts proper though. Cash is NOT an option.  
                      Have a thought to their expense.  If you want Death Pact then bring Pearls. If you want Rune, 
                      bring more Peridots.  Also consider taking 150pp as well to cover the cost of a Necromancer 
                      corpse summon.  Its is not normally expected for you to bring a Coffin due to its bulk.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>If porting stones are required a donation may be expected, ensure you have this money on you 
                      before you arrive.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>Watch out for the Cleric /camp command. If that goes up the raid is going fubar and you have 
                      to protect the cleric at all costs to get them camped. This means everyone, Tank or not, 
                      some tanks and monks may also be designated to camp and or FD also as bodyguards. Unless you 
                      have been told this is your role then you fight any way you can until instructed to camp or 
                      you die.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>If everyone is told to camp then do so as quickly as possible, this is sometimes done to clear 
                      Agro and is particularly common in Fear, failure to do so will kill people.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>If you get lost, feared, LD and come back to an empty room you stand still and if necessary die. 
                      Never train the main camp.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>Once you are told where you can sit, dont move from there untill told you can do so. Some fights 
                      have a tendency to "creep" away from the base location, as a tank you should seek to prevent that, 
                      as support classes you should not move.  Ensure if you have moved you come back to the base 
                      location at the end of the fight so the effects of that creeping is not cumulative.
								  <br><br>
                  <li>/shout is often reserved for people running the BGH, do not use it unless authorised to do so.  
                      All normal zone chat is conducted over /ooc.  Dont spam or /auc, its not funny.  Information 
                      acceptable for /shout can be:
								  <br><br>
                      <ul><li>Linkdeath information</li>
								  <br><br>
                          <li>Group status on buffs and readyness for major pulls</li>
								  <br><br>
                          <li>Emergency issues</li>
                      </ul>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>Item query MUST be set to NO DROP, no item should be looted unless you have been specifically 
                      instructed to.  If you are not sure, dont loot, ask.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <b><center>Rules that will help the raid.</center></b>
                  <ol>
                  <li>It is considered polite to give at least 1 hours notice that you have to leave the raid.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>You must tell your group if you are AFK for any reason.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>Don't sit near walls.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>You will not get exp and will probally end up losing some.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>It is not a good idea to do a BGH on a zone with a minimum level entry requirement until you have 
                      a 1 level buffer.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>You will most likely come out of the raid with nothing more than lighter pockets.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>BGH are often very brief periods of manic activity followed by repetative mob slaying, you will 
                      not see the scenery, you will not find it interesting, despite this you need to remain focused, 
                      things go wrong badly.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>If you need a Epic quest item tell the raid leader in advance, they may not be intending to kill 
                      that mob or go in that area.  They may also have defaulted that item to another person, conversely, 
                      they may default that item to you.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>Many raids opperate a "last piece rule".  This means that if anyone requires just one more item 
                      to get a full suit of class armour, if that item drops, they get it automatically regardless.  
                      You need to tell a raid leader before the raid starts that this is the case and you need to be 
                      able to prove you are on last piece status.  This may mean having to carry unused armour with you 
                      and suffering the encumberance.  If you cannot prove it to anyone who wishes to inspect you, 
                      you won't get the rule applied to you.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>Many guilds have special rules for BGH, check you understand what they are before you start the BGH.</li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>If you are not sure what to do speak to another member of your class before the raid starts.  
                      They will help you.  The raid success depends on people working together, they will give you 
                      advice, look out for you and calm you down and tell you of recomended spell loads and ineffective 
                      spells.  </li>
								  <br><br>
                  <li>Certain classes have to work together cross-group also, cleric and enchanters being the main 
                      classes, look out for each other, consider a /target enchanter or cleric button if you are a 
                      healing class just in case.</li>
