<td><p>The new site has been released.  Please give me as much feedback on this as possible.  Currently the Membership Page and the Charter are available (as well as this news page).  I am working on the following features:
<li>An individual Journal for each member to write their EQ experiences</li>
<li>User updatable profiles and searches on these profiles</li>
<li>Web Based membership control (for Roobeyroo)</li>
<li>Web based New updates</li>
<li>Event Noticeboard and Calendar</li>
<li>A collection of Forums for open discussion</li>
</p>
<p>The Membership list is now almost totally up to date, however I am still missing a few surnames and real life names, so if you see you are missing please let me know.</p>
<p>You will notice the new structure that has been put into place for the rank within the Guild.  This allows me to delegate decisions and tasks out easily.  As the guild is now growing and there are plans in place to allow 2nd Characters in I felt that more structure is required within the officers.</p>
<p>For you tech heads out there, this site has been written using Microsoft Visual Interdev 6.0 utilising Active Server Pages and some Javascript.  It is optimised for running on Internet Explorer 5.0.  All of the content that you see here has been generated from database entries.  Everything on the members page and journal pages is database driven as well.</p></td>
