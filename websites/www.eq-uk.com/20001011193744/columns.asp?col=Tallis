		    <td colspan=2 valign=top>The pickclaw warrior swiped its claws past my face, ducking, I brought up I dirk, catching the foul being in its chest, piercing its foul heart. The warrior screamed, fetid blood pouring from its wound and fell at my feet.  I looked about the dank cellar, the floor lay with pickclaw goblins and the bodies of my comrades, the pickclaw raiding party had been defeated, for another day the stronghold of light , Highpass Keep, stood safe against forces of darkness for another day.<br>Gathering  my possesions I headed to the courtyard for some fresh air.<br><br>There, many heros in shining armour, one armed with a soulfire  stood in highkeep courtyard. They called for us to help defend highkeep from the Daughter of Hate and her armies. They called for us to be gather in 3 groups, the scouts lead by Thubr Axebringer, a dwarf warrior, were to proceed to the commons to defend kithicor zone against the drow army lead by Laarthik K`Shin , a powerful sorcerer and Lanys T`Vyl', Daughter of Hate. Another squad lead by Lord Tehys and Firiona Vie was to defend Highpass by forming an army in Kithicor near Highpass itself with the third gathering under Carson MaCabe in the courtyard for a last ditch defence.<br>Without hesitating I joined Thubr's elites scouts, the desire to be the first to meet the vile Dark Elves singing in my heart. And so, the first small group left with Thubr and set up our defences in the Commons, after arriving there we prepared ourselves, many joined us, swelling our ranks to at least a 100 spread out throughout the Commons with most defending the Kithicor zone. <br><br>(ooc the DE army crashed East commons, we all waited for ages for it to get up and running again)<br><br>We started to here the shouts from the characters in the DE army. An army of light had intercepted them near the toll booths with the Fier Dal, Woodsmen, Elder Enchantress's and wizards under High Lord Silvar and other named npcs engaging the DE army of Tierdal Elite, Ritualists and Bishops being lead by General Sa`Ralis <br><br>(ooc these *very* high level npcs started fighting each other, with the good players were attacking the evil ones, the evil players attacking the good ones, from what I could see there was small army of each of them fighting at the toll booth)<br><br>The army became split as some rushed to see the enemy whilst others guarded the zone itself, as we were stretched out across the zone we were cut to ribbons as the strongest of the DE army summoned the highest players to their sides and utterly detroyed them with squads of Tierdal Elite and Sargents taking out smaller groups of players <br><br>(ooc all red to me, the highest level npcs took down 50's in seconds, the Tier dal Elite were defeated fairly easily albeit with 20 or more of us hacking at it)<br><br>The sounds of the fighting echoed over the commons when at last, I saw a glint of silver armour and a Tierdal Elite came running at the army defending, running in both the players and the good army (npcs) started fighting it, after a quick fight, with 30 people hacking and it and burning with their spells it fell, we barely had time to catch our breath when another squad of elites lead by a sargeant came at us, for a while we fought them, when as I scouted forward I noticed 2 Dark Elves, clad in the strongest of armours running at a small group , then, tearing into our ranks were Lanys T`Vyl and Laarthik K`Shin!  We battled them for a while but they were invunerable to our weapons, i was concentrating on Laaarthik when a Tierdal Elite caught me unawares, before i knew it i was in Highkeep bank contemplating a run back through 2 armies to get my corpse.<br>When entering Kithicor I found that the Tierdal had annihilated our first army and had entered Kithicor itself. Running through Kithicor I came across our second army, lead by Lord Tethys, Delgoth  with the flaming sword and Firiona Vie, a cleric of Tunare and Izuare, an enchantress, with quick greetings I bespoke news of the approaching army and hurried to retrieve my possesions.<br>Casting Camoflauge I proceeded full the forest, retrieved my armour and weapons and ran back to the second army in Kithicor. <br><br>(ooc now this is where it got *really* confusing, both Tierdal and Eldar npcs characters were running aound zone fighting each other as well as players, the npc's were doing zone shouts and whilst all this was going on , a story was being spammed across zone, explaining (or trying to) what was going on)<br><br>At a fork in the path i came across our armies fighting, Delgoths body lay at Laarthiks feet and Laarthik and Tethys fought each other whilst 30 or more engaged Lanys. Rounding a tree I noticed a strange sight, an ogre, named Hate floated 20 feet above the battlefield, I threw a spell at him, but unsuprisingly it effected him little. Another shout went up, Tethys had fallen, realising we had lost our main leaders I threw myself into the battle with Laarthik, standing face to face, hoplessly hacking with my silvery axe when he cast a spell, all around me were thrown into the air, crashing down, greviously wounded, again i faced him, but a spell was cast which chilled me to the bone and again I appeared in Highkeep.<br>I ran back into Kithicor, here Firiona Vie, summoning all the power of Tunare into her was fighting with Lanys and Laarthik.<br><br>(ooc lots of weird messages being spammed here, Firiona Vie was summoning the power of tunare, Laarthik was shouting strange stuff across zone and descriptive messages were appearing, adding atmosphere to the battle .e.g "Energies swirl in the air of the forest, riffling the leaves and bending the branches" "Clouds of tiny insects scream and spiral around the battles, trees wave thier branches as if in distress, and teh earth itself heaves with Mother Natures displeasure"  from my log)<br><br>I ran to the fight, a large group of us were engaging Laarthik and Lanys whilst the rest were trying to figure out what to do with Hate, the floating ogre. Eventually someone realised that our offensive spells were useless and someone casted a heal upon him, this wounded him so all with healing powers cast upon him, he screamed and fell to the ground. Laarthik and Lanys seemed to be taking damage, although they were regenerating as fast as we could hit,  perhaps they took there power from Hate, by applying our healing and blessing upon Hate we had weakened them. <br>I then ran to Lanys, both her and Laarthik seemed to be invunerable, when a shout went up around zone for us to proceed to Carson Macabe and defend Highkkeep as i was leaving I noticed Laarthik then brought out a large glowing orb from his armour, (for what had happened to Firirona Vie I do not know)  with this he brought forth all his powers. <br><br>(ooc , from my log i think Firiona summoned the power of tunare and hurt Lanys, child of hate who then called to Laarthik for help)<br><br>Sensing something nasty was about to happen I left to join the guard in Highkeep, as i ran back Laarthik seemed to be casting a mighty magics, something big was about to happen so I joined the groups defending the zone.<br>From the pass to Highkeep I could hear Laarthik was completing his magics and was summonig Innoruuk himself to the battlefield <br><br>( "Laarthik holds the orb high in the air as its glow brightens and spreads, a dark core at its center. In a strangled voice, he screams, "Innoruuk! I call upon you in the name of Lanys T`Vyl! ATTEND HER!"<br>Shreiking, as if from a thousand tourtured screams, fills the air of Norrath as an immeasurable power creates a great rift in an astral barrier.<br>LAnys tosses her head and laughs throatily as she screams out in welcome to the power of Innorruk. Her body glows with crimson flame as she is drawn upward br th Prince of Hate, her father.<br>Fear and dread fill the hearts of even the most evil races as a miasma of evil is spewn forth from the Plane of Hate"<br>The Plane of Hate has been opened by the battle " )- from my log<br><br>I could see nothing yet knew the final battle was upon us, shouts went up around the zone, an army of undead was upon us. Skeletal troopers appeared, weary after hours of fighting we drew our swords and attacked. <br>After a long fight, it seemed that the army was defeated, Laarthik and the generals of the army of light had disappeared and over a hundred of us stood around puzzled... was that the end ?<br><br>(ooc looks like the Plane Of Hate emptied itself into Kithicor, zombie mendicants, undead clerics, skelatal troopers, zombie generals.. the works. We killed em all and then stood around, all the GMs seemed to have disappeared, no one knew what was happening, it was now 8AM IN THE MORNING =) so i logged out and went and crashed =)<br><br>All in all I had a superb time, I managed to catch the entire GM event from begining to end <br>what i havent mentioned is:<br>the DE army crashed out east commons, we waited for over an hour whilst the GM in charge of the commons army stood around bidding us be patient<br>It was amazingly laggy, with over 100 people fighting 10's of npcs all in one zone, it was more or less unplayable in the middle of the big fights. During the heat of the battle you more or less couldnt move, quite why i wasnt disconnected at all like the rest of my group were i dont know, at one point I cast Harmony on Hate, with the AE effects going off on him and 20 or 30 others round me you can imagine how laggy it was, only the fact Kithicor is dark and foggy meant that we could still play. <br>Some poor sods who joined carson macabe in the army defending highkeep spent the entire night wating for the DE army to appear, which it didnt, i guess the tremoundous lag meant the GMs changed there  mind about moving 100 people into HK courtyard.<br>After the Plane of Hate opened all the GMs disappeared, no one knew if it had ended, no rewards were given, no one knew what was going on. I guess in roleplaying terms it was quite realistic, no real life battles go to plan, confusion often reigns on the battlefield =)<br>I must have missed loads out, but happened to be in each zone where the action was, alot of RPing by the GMS explained the story, but I think I caught the gist of what was going on.<br>It started waaaaay to late and finished gone 8am in the morning, Its shear chance i have today off work or i would have missed it. Anyone who keeps normal hours wouldnt have stood a chance of catching the climax of the battle.<br>I can imagine alot of it will recieve criticsm, with lag, the crashes and confusion pissing alot off. I loved every minute, it was very atmospheric, I had great fun RPing and taking part in an epic fight between armies, no other game has come close to providing anything close to the scale of this.<hr color=White></td>

		    <td colspan=2 valign=top>Mistmoore<br><br>Ive spent the last few levels in Mistmoore, and I have to say this is one of the best zones Ive played in to date. <br>The thing about Mistmoore is that its buggy... the pathing on mobs is screwed, ghost images of mobs appear near zone and the slightest wrong move will bring a train the likes of which are rarely seen in any other zone in Norrath.<br>So why do i like it ? well.. mainly because of some of the reasons above. Its not too busy, its bad repuation keep alot of people away. Those that do go and stay are usually the type of people i like to group with.<br>A badly organized and lead group cannot and will not survive in Mistmoore, a group has to be made out of people who know their roles, know Mistmoore and are always on the ball... in other words people who know the score about teamplay and tactics... my kind of people =)<br><br>Oh... and did I mention the superb exp and decent cash on all the mobs? This zone can give you some seriously good exp if you are careful. <br><br>Here are a few things Ive picked up when hunting <br>Mistmoore in your low to mid 20's.<br><br>There are 2 areas you can pull to, up on the slope behind the lake or in the corner by the tower. The slope is the safest place but difficult to pull to because of the bad pathing on the mobs. The tower place is easier to pull to but has one main disadvantage, if a train is run to zone and your fighting at the time the mobs will train on you to. Almost guaranteed death if its a level 30 + train. You cannot and should not pull to anywhere else, the main objective is to find somewhere where you are out of aggro range of the trains. Both the slope and tower areas have spawns within them, no where is totally safe in Mistmoore. Also dont wander around or go sightseeing, anything that you can see that is interesting can kill you real quick =)<br><br>Unless you are in a safe spot always stay Invis'd or Camo'ed, very few mobs in Mistmoore can see invis, if your a rogue then sneak/hide, these skills work very well in the zone the reason being trains in Mistmoore are very frequent, some have little or no warning and the nasty ones can kill you instantly or worse still, have mobs that can charm you. Getting your corpse back from the zone area is easy, getting it back from deep in the castle where it has ended up after being charmed... well if it can be done without a full group of 40-50's let me know! Your better off saying that you went LD and lost your corpse in the zone and cant find it =) The deepest parts of this zone have killed multiple groups of 40's to 50's.<br><br>If you are unfortuanate enough to have to run to zone with a train try to remeber to put a shout out to zone, its not always possible though, some deaths happen without warning and are very quick, before you even have a chance to reach for your hotkeys you'll be looking at a loading message. A warning from others could save your life.. return the favour!<br><br>Dont let anything get away... snare everything, runners in this zone are a nightmare and will train stuff onto you.<br><br>Druids can run round this zone with some impunity, most of the mobs wont KoS a wolf although some will, con everything, dont take anything for granted.<br><br>Always pull to where you are fighting, dont run down to meet the enemy although its very tricky to get the casters to come to you. If you do fight outside of the 'safety' zones then finish them quick.<br><br>There are 'ghost' images of Deathly Heralds, pets and Gargoyles in and around the zone and lake areas. Although you can see and attack them, due to a bug they are actually deep inside castle, if you attack they will come running *from where they actually are* usually with deep within the castle and always with a train of nasties.<br><br>Dont touch any part of a returning train, dont pull when there's a train out, dont even move =) Just hide in the corners hoping that you arent noticed.<br><br>The puller should go no further than the graveyard to pull, also everything on the return route should be cleared first.<br><br>Keep communications up at all times. If your pulling try and say what you have pulled and if theres a caster identify it so the group can take it down first.<br><br>Watch out for the 'run to zone' messages from your group, you might think that the 2 iniates and gargoyle that you are fighting are fine but someone else may have noticed a large bunch of inkies in silver platemail bearing down on you from behind. <br><br>Always have someone 'leading' the group, I dont mean the person inviting people but someone to watch health, prioritize which enemy to take first, keep up communications, tells others when to pull and when to run. <br><br>Dont wait around at zone to watch the high level trains and mobs, I know its nice to see new creatures and named npcs but these can kill you in seconds. Also if you see a load of players in Lesser Faydark then ask what the train situation on the other side of zone is. If you are grouping for the first time ask someone to show you the ropes, ignorance kills.<br><br>Right, thats about all ive got time for and I havent covered it all yet! <br>Good luck and have fun hunting Mistmoore. It may be difficult but the rewards are well worth it, I havent gained experience anywhere else as fast as I have done in here. <br><hr color=White></td>

		    <td colspan=2 valign=top>"One of the things I like about EQ is the way the world is open to do more or less what you want. I find that my game is split into 2 quite separate styles of play.<br>Just after I make a level I like to relax, wander about, talk to people, and find myself a nice chatty group in an easy area and just take it nice and easy.Last nights group was just that, we set up camp at the bottom of the ramp to highpass and just pulled crags, nothing to much trouble, no trains and plenty of time to talk and rest. It was an interesting group, 3 casters and myself and another ranger. It was all quite amusing as one of them was also tending to her one year old child and another was a mother of 5, and our conversations ranged from where we are and what we do as well as a chatting about her child. Such a nice change from 14 year old powergamers and endless discussions on loot and experience.<br><br>Now the reason I took it easy is that for some reason, at weekends, I turn into a manic powergamer. The way most of the camped areas are empty on a weekend means I can always find myself in a group in a great spot and camp solidly for hours. Unlike some I quite enjoy camping a good spot, as long as my group is decent without any scrubs you can take and hold a difficult spot and really earn yourself some serious exp and loot. This weekend I was in highkeep for the first time, with a very good group. We had the pickclaw lookout area all to ourselves, and after an intial difficult attempt at controlling the room we gained the upper hand and settled down for some serious camping. <br>I like Highkeep, with its bank, merchants and a place to bind all within 50ft of where we were camped, its very convenient. The spawns are great as well, all yellow or red to me, each one requiring a few mins of intensive swordwork, as unusually our group was made up of tanks, shamen and a cleric. Without the casters to finish the mob of in seconds we had to take it down the hard way, and i must admit, it made it so much more fun, with each fight lasting longer it passed the time nicely. <br>My group in Highkeep were mostly members of the Fleur De Lys guild, a French guild and a good bunch of people to play with. They are mostly near my level, I can imagine I will see alot more of them in the future.<br><br>The one disadvantage of my preference for hardcore powergaming sessions is Im leaving my online mates behind. The reason I got into EQ was my ever increasing disillusionment with playing Quake2. I played Quake2 for 18 months with my clan, Cowboys from Hell ( http://www.clanfromhell.com ), but by about July I was bored with the game and the scene, the community, in my opinion, had lost its appeal, with the emphasis on fun been replaced with the need to win. Some of my clanmates had brought EQ and were raving about it so I too brought it and before long was rapidly hooked. When I started they were all quite a few levels above me, they all seem to have a different grasp on the game, taking it alot easier, none of them enjoy sitting in one place and camping for hours like I do, unfortuantly Im now a few levels above them which has made grouping and hanging around with them difficult, mainly because Im far from where they are based. Hopefully our levels will even out soon, for me grouping with your mates is one of the better aspects of EQ. They are all in a guild called The Circle Of The Feliene Hand, which hopefully I may join, Im still dithering over which guild to join, having had several offers. Mind you It only makes sense to join the guild with most of my Q2 clan in it though, having spent the last 18 or so months online with them. If I do join Ill be one of the highest levels in the guild. I guess they need someone to watch over them ;-)<br><br><br>"<hr color=White></td>

		    <td colspan=2 valign=top>"Killstealers, the death of a species ?<br><br>Last nights patch contained a very interesting item, namely that exp and loot is awarded on group aggregate  rather than being given to the person who did the most damage. This has always been one of my bugbears with EQ, how Verant thought that  a system whereby a group could do 79% damage and a solo could do 21% damage and get the kill is acceptable I'll never know. As a ranger, and more importantly a "tank" killstealers have been the bane of my EQ playing recently. I like to group, in fact i never solo, as a result I find myself in mismatched groups, often without a caster, indeed in a place where the loot and experience is good getting a caster to join you is quite difficult with the casters prefering to wait until a group is fighting a mob then letting loose with a spell, invariably killing the mob and getting the exp and loot. This isnt a rare occurence, Its more or less widely know that some casters have never grouped, nor know how to, their only skill being to wait by the sidelines, let someone else take the risks and then take the kill from them. The great thing with the impending changes is that these people will never be able to group, its a fact of life that everyone hates killstealers nor wishes to ever group with them. Their refusal to group, purely based on a need to get ALL the experience and ALL the loot points to a self centered and totally selfish person, the new changes will hurt them and unless they realise that this is a multiplayer game and working with others is to their advantage then they will never get any further.<br><br>Tallis Oakenfold, Ranger of Norrath<br><br>Yup, you've guessed it, I made level 20 at the weekend, in one excellent session I earned my surname and better still a PGT. After all the stories Ive heard about getting the PGT I had more or less given up on going for a loot, tales of week long camping sessions and killstealers abound,  and I was looking to purchase, unfortuantly a PGT is well out of my price range :/ Imagine my suprise when, after I left a very succesful Highhold orc group as it was getting busy there (Highhold Orcs... one of the best places for a single group when the server is empty, once it fills up is one the worse places in Norrath) and decided to go and check out the Highhold Gnolls, imagine my suprise when I find it deserted, I quickly got on tell and grabbed some mates from the adjoining zones, and then we proceeded to wait. After 2 hours Grenix still hadn't spawned but we still had the area to ourselves...on a Saturday evening, an unheard if event perhaps? Eventually  Grenix appeared right in front of me. Now the thing with named spawns is that they always turn up when you least expect it, always take you by suprise and for a few seconds, you stand around looking at him, hands shaking in anticipation, before someone yells or he attacks. After what seemed like an age Grenix dropped, I bent down and there it was, the PGT, after only a few hours camping, no killstealers, no arguments and no hassle =) Looks like the is a God after all (well in my case there definetely is a Godess... Tunare was smiling upon me on that day). For a few mins much elation ensued, with cries of joy echoing around the walls of Highhold, a Soothsayer then spawned and interrupted our celebrations, a few quick blasts from my wizzie pals and he scuttled off , a chase, a few sword strokes and ... DING! level 20. <br>What a great day for Tallis, the PGT and a surname. One after the other.<br>Which was nice.<br><br>One thing that this teach me is that I now know why getting a bunch of people to orderly queue for a named spawn is impossible. The moment you see him your eyes glaze over and all that matters is attacking and killing the spawn.  Any rational thoughts you have melt away with the thought of some really decent loot.<br><br><br>"<hr color=White></td>

		    <td colspan=2 valign=top>"Hmmm... typical, my first real entry and a mini rant on gnome wizards.. what happens? Yes... a encounter with a gnome wizard, albiet a pleasantly different encounter.<br>I went back to the same space in Highhold and lo and behold... a gnome wizard perched on a rock. This time however he asks to join the group, we let him in, after all its miles better to have him in the group rather than lurking at the side, we all have good session and the Shralok with the SBH spawns along with what seems like a small army. We finish Shralok first and then proceed to lay into the other orcs. After a close fight its over and the looting begins.<br><br>and Shralok is gone. <br><br>No suprise really, its very rarely that a named corpse is left for us to decide what to do with it, so someone asks what loot it had, the gnome pipes up "SBH, ringmail legs and some pp" <br>Oh well, thats gone, shoulda guessed someone would have nabbed that first,  the party leader then suggests that we sell the SBH and split the profits. So, to my suprise the gnome auctions it but no buyers about, he then suggests he runs to Freeport auctioning it and then gates back to split the money.<br>To be honest I didnt think I'd see him again, but lo and behold, 25 minutes later a gnome gates in and hands us all 25pp each, my biggest loot to date =)<br><br>Its things like this that really make you reassess your opinions of people, it would have been so easy to just disband and walk off with the SBH, in most groups Ive been in everyone has just kept their loot, regardless of whether someone else needs that item (ive heard of rangers camping Rubicite armour, the only decent armour rangers can wear, for hours upon end, only to have all the casters and non armour wearing classes in their group walk off with the armour leaving the ranger with nothing). When someone in your group performs an unselfish act like this it can really make your day.<br><br>Nice one Galrumple the Gnome! I'll wait a while before judging all ickle gnomes perched on rocks from now on =)""<hr color=White></td>
