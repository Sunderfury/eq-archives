<h2>The following tips for getting Ivy Etched Armor are listed in order of 
difficulty from easiest (the bracers) to hardest (boots or gloves, we're not 
sure which just yet.</h2><BR>

<A NAME="BRACER"></A>

<h2>Tips For Getting A Bracer</h2>
<h3>(Need Water Ring from Dagnor's Cauldron, Rune Of Ivy from Everfrost Peaks, and a 
fire emerald)</h3>

<h4>Redwind (Everfrost)</h4>

<IMG SRC="redwind.jpg" ALT="Redwind"><BR>
Redwind is an orc caster in Everfrost that sits on the platform next to the huge 
statue that lies just over the river towards the Permafrost dungeon.  Redwind is 
surrounded by about five icy orcs and is often camped by barbarians in the area which 
use the orcs for experience.  The spawn rate on each orc and Redwind is 5 minutes and 
Redwind isn't that hard to do if you're in your mid 30s.  Not every Redwind will have 
the rune unfortunately so you'll probably have to do a few.  The bracers quest is the 
easiest of the Ivy Etched Armor quests to do.  If you have a friend who can get the 
quests out of the rangers in Kithicor, bring them too - If they can loot another rune,
it'll save you a long walk back to do this again for the other bracer.  The components 
are Lore and No Drop but the bracer is <B>not</B>.<BR><BR>

<h4>Goblin Tidal Lord (Dagnor's Cauldron)</h4>

<IMG SRC="goblintidal.jpg" ALT="Goblin Tidal Lord"><BR>
Goblin Tidal Lords are fairly easy to find in Dagnor's Cauldron.  Not every 
tidal lord drops a Water Ring but about half did when I was there.  They can usually be 
found wandering around the shoreline or sometimes at one of the camps towards Unrest.  
Again, the bracers are the easiest of the Ivy Etched Armor quests there is.  Again, as 
with Redwind, if you have a friend who can get the quests in Kithicor, bring them too 
as they can loot another Water Ring and save you a long trip back just so you can get 
another bracer.<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="TUNIC"></A>

<h2>Tips For Getting A Tunic</h2>
<h3>(Need Meldrath Skull from Steamfont, Rune Of Ivy from Lesser Faydark, and two regular 
rubies, delivered to Gandari in Kithicor Forest)</h3>

<h4>Meldrath The Malignant (Steamfont Mino Caves)</h4>

<IMG SRC="meldrath.jpg" ALT="Meldrath The Malignant"><BR>
The first thing I wanted was the tunic so I went to Steamfont with some friends to do 
Meldrath the Malignant in the mino caves.  It's easy and not easy.  First, we get there 
and everybody says it's not going to be a problem.  Meldrath is a gnomish necro with a 
pet inside just past those two nasty high level mino guards.  They've beefed up the necro 
a lot since bringing in the armor so watch out.  I went with another ranger and two 
casters and sometimes it got heavy.  We did it twice.  Meldrath likes to cast fear but 
it doesn't usually last that long I found.  The trick is to pull the guards first (one 
if possible (hard), harmony not really an option here, you'll enter their agro range 
before you can see them) and then do Meldrath after.  You have to move quick, the minos 
spawn fast and so does he.  Draw him out of there.  Don't fight him inside or you'll 
probably get a mino respawn on top of you.  The drop on the skull is about a 50/50 
chance.<BR><BR>

<h4>Thistle Underbrush (Lesser Faydark)</h4>

<IMG SRC="thistle.jpg" ALT="Thistle Underbrush"><BR>
No matter what anybody tells you, the Thistle Underbrush spawn point is random.  He 
spawns all over the place.  He might spawn close to the pixie tower or he might not.  
He usually drops the rune component.  A few people have said that maybe 1 in 10 times 
he drops no rune, sometimes nothing at all.  He also sometimes drops a special treat, 
Braided Ivy Cords.  These are very popular with druids.  These used to drop every time 
Thistle died but now they're quite rare.  Even if the cords are dropped, a rune will 
usually drop with it.  It's not like Thistle will drop either or.  Unfortunately druids 
love these things and are now camping the area as well so best of luck.  To get him to 
spawn, it seems the best thing to do is clear pixies around the pixie tower (trickers 
and pranksters only and not the jongleurs as they are very bad for faction with Kelethin 
rangers/druids and Surefall rangers/druids).  Brownie Outcasts will also spawn around 
the tower and must be cleared out as well.  Kill Outcasts/Pixies quick enough and Thistle 
will spawn usually within a 4 hour period at least.  Just get to him before somebody else 
does.  Thistle can be taken solo by a high 30's character or in a group of low 30s.  The 
outcasts must be taken in a group of high 30s and are considerably tougher than Thistle 
but not as tough as the brownies at the brownie village to the North of the pixie tower.

<A NAME="HELM"></A>

<h2>Tips For Getting A Helm</h2>
<h3>(Need Cyclops Charm from Rathe Mountains, Rune Of Ivy from Mistmoore, and a Sapphire)</h3>

<h4>Tarskuk (Rathe Mountains)</h4>

<IMG SRC="tarskuk.jpg" ALT="Tarskuk"><BR>
Tarskuk spawns right near the gypsy camp in Rathe Mountains (seen above).  These days, so 
many people have done Tarskuk that he sometimes just walks around for ages without anybody 
touching him, just because he's so much tougher than the average cyclops.  If he's not 
around, stand a bit out from the gypsy camp to see the area around the camp, the key to 
getting him to spawn is simple - keep the area clear of everything.  That includes lizards, 
bears, skels, cyclopi, anything that spawns in the area.  Keep up the pace and he will 
spawn.  He'll probably spawn on top of you in face.  These things are all placeholders for 
Tarskuk, not just the cyclopi or skels.  He's a lot like GrimFeather (see below), in 
that when you snare him he doesn't quite go as slow as things under snare normally do.  
He runs, but it's not AS fast a run as if he wasn't snared.  Bizarre but true.  Bring a 
caster or two for this one.  He's a bit tougher than most cyclops and seemed to hit for 
a fair bit more, maybe around the level of a Hill Giant but I'm not sure.  I camped the 
area for 3 hours, then somebody gave me the idea to keep clearing the area around the 
gypsy camp.  15 minutes after I started in on that idea, he popped.<BR><BR>

<h4>Deathly Usher (Mistmoore)</h4>

<IMG SRC="usher.jpg" ALT="A Deathly Usher"><BR>
If you're in your high 30s or low 40s, put together a group and go get some outside 
the entrance to the castle or in the "bugged room" behind the graveyard (the easier 
route).  If you're not in that range and you want to get some, here's how you do it.  
You know how nimrods are always training huge piles of scum back to the zone because 
they can't handle the castle? Things like gypsies, thought corrupters, will pillagers, 
etcetera? Well there's usually a couple of Deathly Ushers in there as well.  If you're 
camoed they can't see you.  Head to the zone with a full party, camoed up.  Watch the 
train dissipate and hope that a Deathly Usher leaves last and just pick it off the end 
of the train as it's returning towards the cave.  The rest of the stuff won't come after 
you (unless it's walking alongside the usher) and if you've got a full party, you should 
be able to handle it.  They don't charm like the gypsies on the good side.  On the bad 
side, they have a nasty right hook.  They don't always drop the runes.<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="SLEEVES"></A>

<h2>Tips For Getting Some Sleeves</h2>
<h3>(Need Heart Of Fire from Solusek A, Rune Of Ivy from North Karana, and two star
rubies)</h3>

<h4>Inferno Goblin Wizard (Solusek A)</h4>

<IMG SRC="goblin.jpg" ALT="Inferno Goblin Wizard"><BR>
The Inferno Goblin Wizard was more annoying to find than anything else.  Me and two melee 
friends went into Sol A to find this thing thinking it would be no problem, bue noooooo.
They spawn all over the place, and not always all that often.  You can't use Fire Goblin 
Wizards or anything else, it MUST be Inferno Goblin Wizards.  It can take a long time to 
find one.  The place is a maze.  We were there for well over an hour, lost, falling in 
pit traps, etc. until we finally found one as we were leaving in a fit of anger.  It 
dropped the Heart of Fire on the first try, but they don't drop it every time.  For a 
party of three lvl 38 melee types, fighting the goblin was easy pickings - we hardly lost 
any health.<BR><BR>

<h4>GrimFeather (North Karana)</h4>

<IMG SRC="grimfeather.jpg" ALT="GrimFeather"><BR>
Grimfeather is the size of any other griffon.  If you stand right on the hill by the 
tower, you can easily pick up GrimFeather when he pops up.  My GrimFeather popped 
around the teleport spires and I caught up to it as it was heading to the tower.  
GrimFeather is tough in my opinion.  He conned blue to me at 38 so he's supposed to 
be on the level of a griffin/griffon (those are still blue to me) but it was harder 
than both of those.  When you snare GrimFeather, it says he's snared but he moves 
just about as fast as he would if he were running without snare, and that's fast.  
My caster party member who had jboots on could barely keep away from it and could 
only cast on it when myself or her pet ticked it off enough to pull it off her.  
It was a close shave.  My recommendation, bring two 40 lvl casters with you so they 
can play wizzard pong with the bird for awhile.  You should have seen the panic.  I 
cast snare and my magician friend says "You didn't snare it!" so I said "Yes, the 
snare definitely worked" and she starts yelling "Well snare it again! Snare it again!" 
and so I snare it two more times, both successful but no improvement.  Another 
GrimFeather party had to come by and practically save our ass or we were going to be 
toast I think.<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="LEGS"></A>

<h2>Tips For Getting Some Leggings</h2>
<h3>(Need Quiver Of Kithicor from Ocean Of Tears and the Star Of Odus gem from Erudin 
jeweler shop)</h3>

<h4>Quiver Of Kithicor (Ocean Of Tears)</h4>

<IMG SRC="wiltin.jpg" ALT="Wiltin Windwalker and His Spawn Point"><BR>
Okay, this is where the quests start to be a real pain in the polygon ass as it were.
First, you're going to need this <A HREF="campmap.jpg">map</A>.  You have to hunt 
down a wood-elf thief by the name of Wiltin Windwalker who spawns on Pirate Isle 
(aka. Gornit Isle) in the Ocean Of Tears.  If you take the boat from Freeport towards 
Butcherblok, it's just past Sister Isle on your right as you're sailing.  You can 
jump off the boat and swim to the left of Gornit (the named Hill Giant always hanging 
out in front of the island) and be fairly safe.  Once you're on the island, you want 
to stand at loc point (790, -5270) where you should be safe for most of the duration 
of your camp.  The only exception to this is when high level groups start kiting 
around the Seafury Cyclops and Gornit into your space so have camo ready.  From 
this vantage point, you can clearly see the pirate camp and the spawn point where 
Wiltin will spawn.  When you get there (if the place isn't already camped) you'll 
see a Buccaneer where Wiltin should be (as in the above picture).  You can either kill 
the Buccaneer and starting counting until the next spawn or let him de-pop in about 
60 minutes.  If you kill him, the spawn rate on when the next spawn occurs can vary 
between 80-120 minutes.  If you wait 60 minutes, the Buccaneer suicides and shortly 
thereafter another one spawns or Wiltin does.  Many people have told me that letting 
him de-pop is easily the way to go and makes things much quicker.  I originally did 
it by killing all the Buccaneer spawns and it took me roughly 18 hours to get a 
Wiltin.  Another person I spoke to camped for 3 days (13 hours a day) and another 
got it in a day.  In short, the camp is hell, so bring a pillow with you.  To make 
matters worse, if you do not attack Wiltin within the first 15-30 seconds (don't 
quote me on this, but it's short and you don't want to miss it) of his spawning he 
will suicide and a Buccaneer will spawn in his place.  Annoyed yet? The good news is 
that every Wiltin that I've seen killed had the quiver.  The bad news is that some 
people have looted it and had their quivers dissapeer.  Why? There's a very good 
reason.  This is extremely important to remember --> IF YOU DO NOT KEEP A GENERAL 
INVENTORY SLOT OPEN, THE QUIVER WILL GO POOF WHEN YOU LOOT IT BECAUSE IT CANNOT BE 
CONTAINED IN ANOTHER CONTAINER AND MUST ONLY BE PLACED INTO A GENERAL INVENTORY 
SPACE! So with that done, you get your quiver after days of camping but you need 
to put six arrows into it for it to be complete.  Go back to Lesser Faydark and 
kill Brownie Outcasts around the pixie tower until you have all six of the named 
lore arrows and put them in the quiver.  Then combine the arrows to create a 
"Quiver Of Kithicor - full", which you turn into Leaf Falldim along with a Star 
Of Odus gem from the Erudin jewel shop to get your greaves.  Many people haven't 
been able to figure out how to get Leaf to initiate the greaves quest.  Simply 
ask him "What about Ivy Etched Leggings".  He tells you of a guy you have to track 
down in Kithicor but you can ignore this as that guy just tells you to track down 
Wiltin in the Ocean Of Tears anyway so it's just a waste of time.<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="GLOVES"></A>

<h2>Tips For Getting Some Gloves</h2>
<h3>(Need Broken Bow Part A from Rathe Mountains and Broken Bow Part B from 
Lower Guk (Live Side))</h3>

<h4>Bow Of Kithicor (Rathe Mountains and Lower Guk (Live Side))</h4>

<IMG SRC="maldyn.gif" ALT="Maldyn the Unkempt"><BR>
This quest involves returning the Bow of Kithicor to Leaf in Kithicor.  He mentions
somebody called Maldyn Greenburn in Rathe Mountains having the bow and hunting the
Unkempt Druids.  The spawn rate on Maldyn is ridiculous - something like once every
60-80 hours or so.  When he does spawn, he spawns under the name of Maldyn The
Unkempt.  He's not very talkative but when you kill him, he drops "Broken Bow Part A"
and blurts out some final words to the effect of "Now I will never get the second bow
part from Slaythe in Guk!" which is interesting because there is a ghoul on the "live
side" of Lower Guk called Slaythe The Slayer who is a rare spawn around the Minotaur
Patriarch room and drops "Broken Bow Part B".  Specifically, I've heard he spawns 
somewhere in a room between the Mino Patriarch room and the Jail near the Evil Eye.
Maldyn always seems to spawn in the Hill Giant area of Rathe Mountains.  Some people 
have reported killing him twice in one day and it is currently theorized that the Hill 
Giants may be placeholders for the spawn of Maldyn.  Maldyn is also KoS to Hill Giants 
so don't let them take him down before you can.  He is slightly harder than Thistle 
Underbrush, casting Snare, Barbcoat, etc.  The broken bow parts are not containers
but are Lore and No Drop.  So what do you do with these two bow parts? You hand both 
bow parts to Leaf gets you the gloves.  It is NOT achieved by combining the bow parts 
in a fletching kit as was previously theorized.<BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="BOOTS"></A>

<h2>Tips For Getting Some Boots</h2>
<h3>(Need Mistmoore Granite from Castle Mistmoore, Romium from Temple Of Solusek Ro,
and 2000 gold pieces)</h3>

<h4>Mistmoore Granite (Castle Mistmoore)</h4>

<IMG SRC="garg.jpg" ALT="A Mistmoore Gargoyle"><BR>
Mistmoore Granite is difficult to get.  It only gets dropped by higher level gargs
inside Castle Mistmoore.  Basically you want to find a couple of Leering or Jeering
gargs, nothing low level.  This basically means gargs inside the castle itself.
Getting into the castle can be tough though so you might want to go with a party of 
people who are raiding Mistmoore and ride on their coat tails.<BR><BR>

<h4>Romium (Temple of Solusek Ro)</h4>

<IMG SRC="searfire.jpg" ALT="Lord Searfire"><BR>
When you get your ivy etched leggings from Leaf, he offers you the quest to get
the boots.  To trigger him to talk about the ivy etched gloves quest, tell him
"I will earn the etched ivy boots".  This quest sounds easy doesn't it? It isn't.
There's a dwarven smith in the Temple of Solusek Ro.  You must either have to be 
of amiable or warmly faction with him or he won't give you an item called the 
Sol Cauldron.  You'll need the Cauldron to make Romium, used for this quest.  To 
get your faction up with him, you can either kill LOTS of Shadowed Men (we're 
talking about 200+ at least) or you can do a simple quest in Mistmoore.  In the 
Mistmoore graveyard there's a flower on top of the coffin in the graveyard tomb.  
Take the flower, run around outside to the back to the tomb and give it to Synthi, 
the invisble floating figure with the book and you'll get a faction adjustment.  
You can far more flowers than Shadowed Men per hour AND it's much safer.  Just 
stay invis the whole time and be careful.  Every now and then a roamer will come 
out of the "bugged room" area and you might have to kill it or run to zone but 
this won't put much of a dent in your plans.  In my opinion, the flower quest is 
FAR faster and easier to do.  You'll probably need to do it for a few hours and 
it seems to give a stronger faction adjustment than killing Shadowed Men does.  
One of the worst things you can do to mess up your faction in the temple is to 
hail the hidden Efreeti under the temple or kill Temple oriented NPCs in Norrath 
such as Synthi herself.  By the way, if somebody comes along and kills Synthi 
while you're there, her respawn time is very quick (2-3 minutes I think).  Doing 
the quest during peak hours when the graveyard is camped is probably your best 
bet.  Assuming your faction is high enough though, you'll need a few items in 
order to make Romium.  These are: two bars of enchanted platinum (you'll
need a high level enchanter friend to enchant these bought bars for you), another
piece of Mistmoore Granite (apart from the one you need to hand in to Leaf, so
get this one and make the Romium first, THEN go get another from Mistmoore),
the Sands of Ro (dropped by Sand Giants in Ro and Oasis), Melatite, and the Soil
of Underfoot.  Melatite is found as a rare drop off CWGs in Solusek A and looks 
like a small pink brick.  It is not to be confused with the black spherical 
Melanite (or whatever it's called) found easily in Steamfont Mountains.  Mudfoot
Soil is found like so:  Kill skeletons, lots, to get about 180 bone chips.  Then 
go to Kaladim and visit Gunlok Jure in the Paladin Guild.  If you feed them bone 
chips in batches of 4 (separated or stacked, doesn't matter) and he'll give you 
money and faction with Kaladim clerics.  Once your faction is up to amiable with 
Priestess Ghalea in the Kaladim cleric's guild, head over to Lesser Faydark and 
get 4 pixie dusts (from a vendor, players, or whatever) and feed her the four 
pixie dusts to get the Mudfoot Soil.  She won't give you the quest for the soil 
unless you're amiable faction so all you dwarf killing weenies are SOL on this 
one I'm afraid.  As for the Melatite, this is really hard stuff to get and one 
of the primary reasons people are going to have such a hard time doing these 
quests.  Melatite is a very rare drop off CWGs in Solusek A.  People have camped 
all day for this stuff and never gotten any.  Mind you, I went to get some of 
this stuff and got it off the first one I killed, so who knows.  The other day 
somebody told me it drops on models XB, XC, MB, and MC.  Anyway, fluff up that
pillow you had in the Ocean Of Tears though -- it might be a long camp once again.
Anyway, once you hand in all these items to the dwarven smith in the temple, he
gives you a "Sol Cauldron" to place all the items in and combine to make the Romium.
People with no smithing skills at all have made the Romium with no problems so you
don't apparently need to be a master smith to do the combination.  KEEP IN MIND
THAT ROMIUM IS DROPPABLE AND MAY BE EASIER TO BUY OFF SOMEONE THAN TO MAKE.  As 
far as the faerie dust, you want to avoid killing them because you need faction 
with them in order to do your RainCaller bow quest in the future.  You might be 
able to buy the dust from the ranger vendors to the south of the faerie camp in 
Lesser Faydark - maybe people who<B><I>do</I></B> kill them have sold some of the 
dust off.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="MORIN"></A>

<h2>Tips For Getting A Short Sword Of Morin</h2>
<h3>(Need Detailed Map from West Karanas)</h3>

<h4>Ghoul Messenger (West Karanas)</h4>

<IMG SRC="ghoul.jpg" ALT="The Ghoul Messenger"><BR>
Here's the Ghoul Messenger seen just south of the E/W road in the West Karanas.  
He always spawns in the West Karanas near the ogre camp and cyclops area.  He then 
immediately starts running towards the dead camp near the short.  He runs over a 
big hill at the start, then crosses the E/W road, heading towards the dead camp.  
If you stand at loc (-2500, -10400) you can catch the spawn on your tracker everytime 
it pops.  The spawn varies.  Sometimes he the spawn pops every 15 minutes for a long 
period of time.  Sometimes it 7 minute intervals, 20 minute intervals, and sometimes
there's huge periods where he and the placeholders don't spawn at all for an hour or 
more even.  Some people have even waited a whole day for one.  No joke.  Sometimes, 
a regular ghoul will pop instead of the Messenger.  Every Ghoul Messenger I've seen 
looted had the map on the first try.  Take this map to Morin Shadowbane in Kithicor 
Forest and she'll give you her sword.  To challenge the Ghoul Messenger, you should 
be high 30s or in a party of low 30s.  Draygar Stormbow originally sent me a map of 
West Karana with the camp spot marked with an "X".  I've since had to remove it 
because it turned out it was from EQ Atlas and some dork called Muse who runs that 
site wanted it removed.  God only knows why.  Muse's maps are god awful to look at 
and why anybody would reproduce them and put his precious copyright in jeopardy is 
beyond me, but if Muse wants to be a big dink about it and threaten me via e-mail 
over some god awful looking map of the fucking West Karanas, so be it.  Here's a 
better <A HREF="wkaranamap.jpg">map</A>, that's free, unprotected by copyright, or 
some Bill Gates loving geek somewhere in his mom's house making money off dumb ass 
looking t-shirts with maps of Sol B on the back of them.<BR>

<h2>Tips For Getting The Raincaller Bow</h2>
<h3>(Need Trueshot Bow, Treant Heart, 3000 Gold Coins and Fairie Gold Dust)</h3>

<IMG SRC="mermaid.jpg" ALT="A Golden Haired Mermaid"><BR>
This is a long long quest and I'm going on the assumption that you already have
a Trueshot Bow before we get started on this.  Okay, start out in Cazic-Thule
first and kill two Gorillas in the "tae room" just off the courtyard.  They
drop hair everytime they die.  Get two pieces.  Now head to Freeport and give
a whole slew (10 or so) small lanterns to Jyle Windshot in West Freeport.  He's
upstairs in the Freeport Inn.  He's not to be confused with a Jyle Windshot in
East Freeport, who won't do anything with the lanterns.  Anyway, give him these
lanterns one by one.  He'll usually give you a piece of Treant Wood.  Every now
and then he'll give you a Wooden Heart.  Keep it.  Discard any remaining small
lanterns or treant wood you get from Jyle.  Small lanterns can be bought from
the innkeep at the East Freeport Inn.  Now find a vendor called Ping Fuzzlecutter
in West Freeport.  Buy 10 of the Fuzzlecutter Formula 5000 hair tonics off him
(12 if you want to be really careful).  Keep these in a slot where they can't
possibly be drunk.  If you run of out water or drinkables, they will be drunk!
Now head to the Faydwer continent and down to Ak'Anon.  In the back of Ak'Anon
there's a junk dealer called Sanfyrd Featherhead.  Say to him "what fairie wing?"
and he'll chat a bit.  Then say "I am your friend" and he'll chat some more.
Finally, say "I will fetch the hair tonic" and he'll give you a 10 slot
container.  Put the tonics you bought in the box, combine, and give back to
him.  He'll want you to return to Ping with his toupee to get it fixed.  Say
"I will repair the toupee" and he gives his toupee to you.  Now (this is where
it gets difficult), take a full party of 40+ people to Kedge Keep (that's
right, the icky underwater dungeon underneath Dagnor's Cauldron).  Once
inside Kedge Keep (it's a bit of a maze), go straight out and down a big hole
leading to the next floor down and straight out again which leads to a small
room with one hole going up and one hole going down.  The one going up leads
to a room in which a mermaid spawns.  Sometimes it's a mermaid, sometimes it's
a fish, and sometimes it's a special mermaid called "a golden haired mermaid" 
which is what you want.  She does have some piranhas around her
but some say she's sometimes alone or with only 1 pirahna.  Kill her with a
full party and loot.  She'll have a piece of No Drop hair, which she always
drops.  Get it right the first time because sometimes she takes a long time 
to spawn again (hours) although the night I did it she spawned twice in an 
hour.  Now get the hell out of there! Head back to West Freeport to see Ping. 
Talk to him and he'll talk about making the mane attraction, to which you should
tell him you want him to make it for you.  He'll want the toupee, the mermaid
hair and the 2 pieces of gorilla hair from WAY back at the start.  Give all
of those to him and he'll give you the repaired toupee.  Take the repaired
toupee all the way back to Ak'Anon to Sanfyrd, turn it in for a wing.  Take
the wing to Lesser Faydark, specifically the fairie village.  There's an
NPC there called Princess Jolena.  If she's not there, just wait and she
should show up in about 12 hours (game time) max.  She spawns and despawns,
back and forth.  There is a placeholder next to Gearheart for her.  In her 
place will be a fairy guard.  Give her the wing (you don't have to talk to 
her, but you can) and she'll give you some fairie gold dust.  Now go to 
Felwithe and take out 3000 gold coins and your Trueshot Bow.  Head through 
to the second section of Felwithe and into the enchanters area.  Speak to a 
Kinool Goldsinger and you'll get the quest for the bow.  Turn in the gold 
coins, the treant heart (from way back), the Trueshot Bow, and the fairie 
gold dust and he'll give you the Raincaller.  There were originally some 
problems with the quest in that trigger statements about [fairies] weren't 
working because of some spelling mistakes.  If you are having problems with 
this, try spelling the word as "fairie" and "fairy".  One of those should 
work, although this problem may have been fixed by the time you read this.
Also, it can be difficult to get Kinool to talk, especially seeing as he 
is apprenhensive to lots of people.  The phrase to get him talking is 
"where rain caller" with a space in the word Raincaller - another wonderful 
spelling mistake from the people that brought you fairy/faerie/fairie.<BR>

<h2>Tips For Getting The Call Of Flame Spell</h2>
<h3>(Need an Electrum Bladed Wakizashi, a Burnt Sash, an Adamantine Band and a Special Gift)</h3>

<IMG SRC="ashwoods.jpg" ALT="Lily and Devin Ashwood"><BR>
Firstly, go to Kelethin and find a small unmarked house with a brother and 
sister team in it called Lily and Devin Ashwood.  The house can be found one 
platform up from the bank.  It's a house on the platform between the druid 
guild and the bank.  When you get there, hail Lily.  She'll respond.  Then 
say "I am a ranger" to her.  She'll respond and her brother will chip in, about 
Ganelorn Oast.  To the brother, say "Who is the greatest?" and he'll reply about 
Ganelorn Oast and how he trains dedicated foresters.  Say to Devin, "Call the 
flame" which is short, but the trigger works.  If Devin asks you to run along 
and fight some low level creatures, this is because you are not level 50.  You 
MUST be level 50 in order to do this quest or Devin will not continue.  Devin 
will talk about and then say "I want to learn from him, I will prove myself a 
forester".  Lily then offers to give you a letter to deliver to Ganelorn, to 
which you say "I will deliver the letter".  Then target her and say "I will 
take the letter" and then she will actually give it to you.  Now, go to Mistmoore 
and get yourself an Electrum Bladed Wakizashi (I make that sound easy eh?).  Then 
go to Solusek B and loot a Burnt Sash off an Imp Protector, and finally, go to 
Lower Guk and get an Adamantine Band off the Reanimated Hand (it's a rare drop).  
Keep in mind that the Burnt Sash and Electrum Bladed Wakizashi are no drop items.<BR>

Now head out to East Karana and find Ganelorn Oast.  He's just beside the 
barbarian camp to the SouthEast part of the map.  Hail him and give him Lily's 
note.  He'll give you some eggs to take to Kithicor Woods and give to Kithicor.<BR>

Head out to Kithicor Woods and give the eggs to Kithicor.  He'll give you an "icon" 
to show other rangers you are a dedicated forester.  Go during daytime or you will 
almost certainly perish at the hand of the dead that inhabit this forest by night. 
Now return to see Ganelorn in East Karana and give him the icon.  He'll reply that 
he wants to see the following items: An electrum blade (meaning an Electrum Bladed 
Wakizashi), an Ademantine Band, a Burnt Sash and a gift from a merchant called Aanima 
Rockfinder.<BR>
<IMG SRC="aanima.jpg" ALT="Aanima Rockfinder"><BR>
Aanima Rockfinder is a merchant in Kaladim, inside the Everhot Forge.  You'll be given 
a claim check by Ganelorn to give to her in order to get the gift.  Return all four 
items to Ganelorn and he'll ask you to bring him the head of the notorious poacher, 
Vance Bearstalker.<BR>

Vance is a level 53 character who looks like a human bandit or something.  He'll also 
spawn within East Karana as soon as you hand in the items and cannot be camped for in 
any way other than handing in the items.  Approximately 3 level 50 people could take 
him down.  When killed, he drops a head which is handed in to Ganelorn, who then gives 
you the Call of Flame spell.<BR>
