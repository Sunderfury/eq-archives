    <td width="100%" valign="top"><font face="Arial" size="3">~ OOC ~ Just a little backround
    for these next sets of journal entries. Temyez has returned home from Kunark and is trying
    to fit back in to regular life, however things have changed for him and he is uneasy. As I
    have stated before, some of these entries have been written to reflect witings from other
    people involved in what was happening at the time, so some of it may seem as though there
    are things missing, but, it is enough for you to understand what happened and where Temyez
    is today. All of this happened about a month and a half ago, perhaps even longer. I
    apologize for not posting anything sooner, but I needed some time to adjust and accept.
    You may not entirely understand why these events have taken place, let me assure that
    there are reasons for what has happened and although I will not go into them or what
    brought all this on, at least you will know where it has all led to. ~ OOC ~</font><font
    size="4"><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaping a
    mound of potatoes onto his plate to go along with the healthy portion of meat that he had,
    Temyez began to eat. He didn't speak much during the dinner, He didn't seem to speak much
    at all lately. In the weeks following his return from Kunark and the loss of his heart and
    soul he found that he just didn't have much to say. He hadn't told anyone what had
    happened, he hadn't told anyone that he had lost his feelings, hadn't said a word about
    the seeming loss of his emotions. He had avoided telling the Lady Siniana about any of it,
    with all of the memories they had shared it seemed to him that it would be somewhat
    difficult. When she had approached him and asked him what was wrong, he had simply said
    that he didn't know, but he felt he needed some space to figure some things out. She had
    understood that and had given him the space he requested, for that was the kind of
    relationship they had, each of them free to do what they wished, each of them giving as
    much space as the other may need, no questions, no regrets.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Finishing his dinner he took his plate into the kitchen
    and noticed right away that Lady Siniana was not there, not that there was anything wrong
    with that, she was free to go where she wished. He just found it a little unusual that she
    had excused herself from the table into the kitchen and now was not here. Not thinking
    anything more about it he washed his plate and set it into the strainer, next he washed
    his tableware and placed them into the straining cup to be put away later. He left the
    kitchen through the back hall, avoiding the others who were laughing in the dining room,
    as was his custom for the last few weeks. He would retire to his chambers for the night to
    write some for his Journal, or perhaps work on some drawings, as a matter of fact, he
    thought, it was about time to be heading out for a few weeks in the wilderness. Back to
    the nature that he loved, where he could be alone, not having to think about how he might
    be acting, not having to think about what the others may think was wrong. Back into the
    wilderness where it would be just him, alone with his memories.</font></font></td>
