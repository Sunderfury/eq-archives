    <small>When I met Sentinal I was wary of grouping with him. He and another magic user
    (alas, I cannot remember the name of the other) had asked me to hunt with them and quite
    frankly I thought that being magic users I would have little or no use for them in battle.
    I have never been more wrong in my life. Sentinal showed me what a good magic user can do
    and it was an experience that will stay with me forever. He showed no fear as we fought
    anything that came our way on the Plains that day, and his fellowship and camaraderie were
    both very much appreciated.I learned that day not to make quick judgements about people
    and it is a lesson that I will never forget.<br>
    I am glad to call him my friend and would be honored to travel with him again. Stay well
    my friend and may Tunare strengthen you</small>.</font></td>
