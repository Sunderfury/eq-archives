    The Night Before Battle</font><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Twas the night before
    battle, and all through the ranks not a person was stirring, not even the tanks.<br>
    The weapons were hung at their side with great care, in hopes that they would remain
    there.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">The clerics had all of the spells in their head, in hopes
    they would not have to raise any dead.<br>
    My friend Klymeth with his mace, and I with my sword, had prepared ourselves to battle a
    great horde.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">When out on the plains there arose such a clatter, I
    sprang from the ranks to see what was the matter.<br>
    I ran to the cliff edge and stopped fairly clean, and looked over the edge to see what
    could be seen.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">The moons waning light falling full on the ground made
    mysterious shadows of everything around.<br>
    When what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a great ball of light, which made
    everything clear.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">At the center of light, beautiful as a spring day, I knew
    in a moment, The Great Mother Tunare.<br>
    More rapid than eagles the light expanded and grew, and she shouted out greetings as fast
    as She flew.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&quot;Now, Ogres! Now, Trolls! Now, Elves of all types!
    Now, Humans! Now, Dwarves and Barbarians alike.<br>
    Across all the plains to the top of the cliffs, the voice rose like thunder in high tones
    and low riffs.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when
    they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.<br>
    So up, high up went the light into the air, flew The Mother Tunare, while all could just
    stare.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">And then, in a twinkling, I heard above all, as if spoken
    to me personally, I heard The Mothers call.<br>
    As I drew in my breath, and was turning around, down came Tunare and alighted on the
    ground.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">She was dressed all in white, from Her head to Her toe,
    and Her clothes they gave off a wonderful glow.<br>
    Many wondrous lights flew and circled around, and She looked like an angel floating above
    ground.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Her eyes, how they twinkled! Her dimples how merry! Her
    cheeks were like roses, Her face like a fairy.<br>
    Her beautiful mouth was drawn up like a bow, and Her hair was as white as new fallen snow.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">A staff of great light She held tight in Her hand, and
    around both Her wrists she wore a gold band.<br>
    She had a narrow face and was very slim, and Her outfit was laced with a glowing yellow
    trim.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">She was beautiful and charming, a right jolly elf, and I
    smiled when I saw Her, in spite of myself.<br>
    A wink of Her eye and a twist of Her head, soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">She spoke not a word, but went straight to Her work,
    filling everyone with peace; then turned with a jerk.<br>
    Lifting Her staff it gave off a great light, and giving a nod, She rose into the night.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Then again came the light, and with it a loud roar, up and
    away She flew and with Her all thoughts of war.<br>
    And we heard Her exclaim, as She flew out of sight, &quot;Peace and Joy to all, and to all
    a GoodNight!&quot;</font></font></td>
