    </strong><small>This particular camp of low level Orcs located on the Commonlands east of
    Freeport was just about empty when I found it due to roaming adventurers who had killed
    all the Orcs before my arrival. The Orcs, a race of gorilla looking beasts, vary greatly
    in level of difficulty and can be extremely dangerous, they should be approached by fairly
    experienced adventurers using caution and care.</small></td>
