    </strong><small>The Innothule Swamp located in the lower South Eastern corner of the
    continent Antonica is a dull, smelly, and foul swampland. Being a swamp it consists mostly
    of water with small islands and areas of land. Here an adventurer will encounter the
    Frogloks, a race of frog men and many creatures of the swamp such as snakes, alligators,
    rats, kobolds, fungusmen, and of course frogloks and the occasional undead. The entrance
    to the Feerott and the ogre city of Grobb can be found here as well as Guk, the realm of
    the froglok. The Innothule Swamp is a low level area mainly for very young ogres and
    adventurers, but you should still exercise caution when traveling here.</small></td>
