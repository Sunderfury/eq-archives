    </strong><small>The Lesser faydark is the lower section of the great Faydark Forest
    located in the central region of the continent Faydwer. The Lesser Fay is considered to be
    a low to mid level hunting area and can be a great source of wealth. It is mostly
    inhabited by giant spiders, giant wasps, orcs, faeries, pixies, bandits, brownies, and the
    occasional undead. An adventurer can start to hunt here at level 7 and above if they are
    fairly careful. There is a ranger camp that sells food and supplies and the entrance to
    the Steamfont Mountains and Mistmoore Castle can also be found here. The Lesser Fay can be
    a somewhat dark and foggy place so caution should be used when traveling, keep your eyes
    and ears open.</small></td>
