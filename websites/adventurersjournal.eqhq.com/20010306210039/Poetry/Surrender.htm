    <br>
    Soft moans of pleasure...<br>
    A sweet breeze upon my neck...<br>
    Velvet kisses upon my lips...<br>
    Beneath me a blanket of soft green grass...<br>
    In the distance the sound of water...<br>
    Perhaps a water fall...<br>
    For I cannot think...<br>
    The passion in your eyes seem to devour me whole...<br>
    My self control...<br>
    There is no more...<br>
    For I surrender to the fire in your touch...<br>
    The taste of your lips...<br>
    The passion in your eyes...<br>
    Below the midnight sky...<br>
    I make myself whole as I surrender to you...<br>
    Giving all and taking all that's returned...</font></big></td>
