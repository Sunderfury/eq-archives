    Island (Wisp Island)</strong><br>
    <small>Erud's Crossing Island sometimes known as Wisp Island is located in the middle of
    Erud's Crossing, the body of water located between the continents of Antonica and Odus.
    The boat from Qeynos stops at the island on the way to Erudin, but not on the way back.
    The island can be dangerous to those who are not prepared for what lives there. Among the
    spiders and beetles there is also the occasional wisp and higher level undead sailors,
    island madmen sometimes roam the area, and sharks and pirahna infest the waters. A few
    things you should know if you are planning on going to the island, first the island is
    very small, second be prepared for the MOBS to attack in groups because of the small area,
    third there is absolutely nowhere to run if you get into trouble, there are no zones and
    no guards, the islanders will not help (I've heard that they will actually attack YOU, if
    you kill their beloved beetles) so, as always, be prepared and be careful.</small></td>
