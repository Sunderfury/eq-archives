    size="4"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">So I'm sitting in South Karana, where I've been
    sitting for the last few days, waiting for the elusive Quillmane (Pegasus) to show up. I
    have heard rumors for quite some time now about this fantastic creature and I have decided
    to see for myself whether the rumors are true. I have been here off and on for 3 days or
    so tracking many named creatures and killing them for their rare equipment. It is slow and
    there is not much to do, most of the named that I have hunted are very low level and
    killing them proves to be no problem at all, but it helps to alleviate the boredom. I am
    thinking that this is a load of gnollcrap! Quillmane doesn't even exist, afterall I have
    spent at least one entire day just sitting here tracking and NOTHING shows, so I'm
    thinking this thing doesn't even exist anymore or something. Oh well, what the heck the
    night is a total loss anyways, I'll just sit and have some dinner and then camp for the
    evening. After a few minutes I decide to have a look around and check my tracking,
    although I am sure that nothing is out there. Suddenly I pick up a trail and POW, right at
    the top of my tracking list, there it is, QUILLMANE! My heart starts pumping as I begin
    tracking and I start to chase it down, I am running with SOW and my heart is pumping cause
    I know that any minute someone else might pick her up on track and start hunting her and I
    want her badly. Just as I come over a small hill I see her there flying above the ground,
    she is not moving, just hovering there. She is an awesome creature and her rarity only
    adds to the excitement. I stop and stare for a moment, my heart beats wildly as I watch, I
    haven't felt this way for quite a while, I only stare for a second though for I know how
    people are and I must attack and accomplish my goal before someone else comes along. I
    cast snare on the beast and it comes after me as I begin the kiting method that I have
    decided I should use on her for a little while at least. Thinking I must draw her away
    from any crowds I begin the kiting, but alas in the excitement I am not sure where I am
    and which direction I must take her. After a few casts of Careless Lightning I can see
    that it probably won't matter anyway as I will have her below half health very quickly.
    Finally it is time to begin melee, and I have at her with my Yaks flying wildly, very
    quickly she turns away to run, but the snare holds her until she finally dies and falls to
    the ground. I am in shock, I am utterly bewildered that after all this time waiting the
    moment is finally here to receive the Pegasus Cloak, the wonderous cloak that enables its
    wearer to levitate on command. Kneeling down I look at the corpse and cry out in
    frustration and anger, &quot;NOOOOOOO&quot; ................................ She only
    carries the Feathered Leggings this day, no cloak afterall, BAH! Oh well, perhaps in
    another few days I will get another opportunity, for now that I know that creatures such
    as this do exist I will wait for another opportunity to get the cloak I so badly want. </font><p><font
    face="Tempus Sans ITC">UPDATE &#150; After a few more days of camping in the South
    Karanas, Quillmane showed up again and I tracked her down and killed her once more. This
    time I received the ultra rare Pegasus Feathered Cloak. It is an excellent piece of
    equipment that allows unlimited Levitation to its user. The effect can be used when
    wearing or just carrying and I love it. I think it was worth every day that I spent in
    that boring place.</font></font></td>
