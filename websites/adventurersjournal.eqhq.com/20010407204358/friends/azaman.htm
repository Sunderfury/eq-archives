    </strong></big>I met Azaman in the city of Rivervale, I needed to be bound to the city and
    he did it for no charge. Then He took the time to show me the way out toward freeport
    (where I happened to be heading at the time). I needed to do some exploring before moving
    on, but he seemed perfectly willing to help me with whatever I might need. For his
    kindness I thank him and would be happy to group with him in the future. Good Luck Azaman,
    and may Tunare the Queen of kindness always be with you.</font></big></td>
