    I wanted to update everyone on the story of my encounter with the ghoul messenger. After
    the recent guild meeting, a few of my brothers helped me to obtain the Short Sword of
    Morin. A group consisting of Klymeth, Conwen, Haemish, Valint, and myself, traveled to the
    Western Karanas to hunt down and kill the Ghoul messenger. After much turmoil, a failed
    first attack in which many of us were killed, being lost in the mountains, being chased
    out by a werewolf, and the general frustration of waiting, we finally managed to locate
    and kill the beast. The strategy we used amounted to Brother Haemish taunting the creature
    to chase him for some time while he assaulted it with spells, then the fighters engaged it
    in melee, while the healers primarily cast heal spells on any fighters needing it, even
    then the creature fought violently. In the end we were victorious with the help of Tunare.
    I would like to take a moment to thank my fellow brothers without whose help I would not
    have such a magnificent sword, Thank you friends, you were there for me, and Tunare
    willing, I will be there for you.&nbsp; May the Glory and Blessings of The Great Mother be
    upon you always.<br>

    December 20<br>
    I am roused from my meditations by the shouts and commotion along the shore. Arriving at
    the docks, I am relieved, the long journey across the Ocean of Tears is behind me and
    though it is a dull and boring trip it gave me time to reflect upon recent events. Our
    guild has been formed, we have had our first &#145;official&#146; meeting and the
    responsibilities of a leadership position loom before me. Walking down the docks I am
    jarred from these thoughts by a minor collision with a dwarf, &quot;Excuse me&quot; I say,
    as the dwarf continues moving past, &quot;Harummff, scuse yerself haf-breed!&quot; the
    dwarf cries as he turns slightly to face me. My hand instinctively moves down to the hilt
    of my sword, his words have caught me unprepared, they have hurt me more than anything
    else he might have said and my anger rises from deep within. The dwarf looks at me more
    closely now, mayhaps realizing his mistake, staring at a fully armed and armored ranger
    his eyes widen as he begins to back away. &quot;Watch your tongue dwarf&quot; I growl,
    stepping forward. &quot;Ye have no right, Ye have no right&quot; he yells as he begins to
    turn and run. I spring into action and swiftly plant the fore of my boot squarely on his
    arse, the dwarf flies through the air flailing wildly and cursing profusely as he goes
    over the side of the dock and lands with loud splash in the bay. The crowd has somewhat
    cleared away as two guards come running up and ask if I know what happened, &quot;I think
    a drunk has fallen into the water&quot;, I reply as I make my way back down the dock. The
    anger is still with me, probably will stay with me for some time, but eventually it will
    die down. Years ago I may have killed the dwarf for making such a statement, but with age
    comes maturity and with maturity increased responsibility. Ahhh well, it will never cease
    to amaze me the many ways people will show their ignorance.</font><br>
    <font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="3">As I entered the open square, the docks behind me, I
    look into the distance at the Butcherblock Mountains and think about the trials and
    tribulations that are ahead, the guild is already growing and we must make a name for
    ourselves. Out of the corner of my eye I see the petite and shapely form of a wood elf
    woman, I turn and watch her walk down the path, a smile creeps on to my face. Behind me I
    hear a commotion, turning I can barely see a small gathering of people as they watch an
    even smaller figure emerge from the water yelling and screaming obscenities. My smile
    becomes a laugh as I duck into a merchant&#146;s shop. I begin scanning the shops wares
    looking for a particular piece of armor. I ask the shopkeeper if he has a bloodstained
    tunic for sale, he responds by saying he has never seen such a thing, I am not surprised,
    I have heard they are fairly rare, oh well, my search continues. As I head out of the
    merchant&#146;s shop and turn toward the mountain path my thoughts return to the recent
    guild meeting and our new initiates, two new initiates in particular, Snydarea and
    Siniana, both beautiful women, both worthy additions to the guild. The lovely Lady
    Snydarea, any man would desire such a creature, and the enchanting Lady Siniana, I had
    been entranced by her at the meeting unable to concentrate on anything for long without
    returning my gaze to her. A smile once again creeps on to my face, and as I walk down the
    path towards the mountains the smile stays with me as my mind races ahead.</font></td>
