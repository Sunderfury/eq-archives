    <small>Freeport, a huge city located on the eastern coast of the continent of Antonica.
    Sometimes called the city of men, it is at least twice the size of Qeynos and easily the
    largest city on the continent. You can find everything that you will need for travelling
    inside the gates as well as many other items for you to purchase from the willing
    merchants. It is the home to many Guilds, temples and training centers where you can
    improve your skills or just meditate for a spell. The docks are located in the eastern
    section of the city and it is there where you can board a ship to the continent Faydwer.
    The city is filled with quests and rumors that would afford the enterprising adventurer
    the chance to find fame and fortune.</small></td>
