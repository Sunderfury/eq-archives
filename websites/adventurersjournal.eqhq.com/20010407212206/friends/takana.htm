    </big>I met Takana very early in my travels and since then we have adventured together
    quite a few times. She has always been a source for good times, quick with a joke and
    always in good spirits. Her light hearted attitude never fails to keep me in a good mood
    and her great beauty (both outside and from within) never fails to keep me enthralled. She
    also has a great inner strength and any adventuring group would be lucky to have her
    along. I am deeply honored to call her a friend and look forward to further adventures
    that we might share together.<br>
    <br>
    I pray to Tunare, the Great Mother, for her continued safety and happiness.</font></big><p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">I have recently found out that Takana has been taken to the great
    hunting ground in the sky. I know that she is happy and in the loving arms of the Great
    Mother.</font></big></td>
