    </strong><small>The Butcherblock Mountains are located on the continent Faydwer. The port
    is located here as well as the city of Kaladim, the entrance to Dagnor's Cauldron, and the
    Greater Faydark can also be found in this area. It is a fairly large zone where you will
    encounter many low level creatures and adventurers. There are many things to see in this
    region as well as many merchants and shops. So, go and explore everything, but as always
    be careful.</small></td>
