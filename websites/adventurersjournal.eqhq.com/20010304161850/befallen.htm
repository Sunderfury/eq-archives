    <small>The dungeon Befallen is a hideous place located in the Western Commonlands. It is
    full of rats, undead creatures, and evil necromancers. It consists of three levels each
    one harder than the previous, to gain entrance to the next level an evil shadowknight
    guardian must be defeated and a key looted off him to open the level door. The first floor
    is fairly easy, but don't be fooled, the deeper floors can get very nasty. The first floor
    can be hunted by a careful low level adventurer, but the deeper floors , in my opinion,
    will require at least level 13 or higher and some areas even higher than that. There are
    some great treasures to be found here for the sturdy adventurer, but as always be very
    careful. </small></td>
