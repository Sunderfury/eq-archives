    </font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">I sat there totally stunned, unable to
    entirely believe what had happened, as the voices of everyone around me joined into what
    seemed to be some distant background noise. It had been so long now since I had someplace
    to call home, so long since I had anyone to turn to in time of need. As the discussions of
    everyone around me went on, my mind slowly drifts back to the events that started this
    wonderful day.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been hunting on the Northern edge of the
    frozen plains, on the newfound continent of Velious, in an area known as the East Wastes.
    The place was filled with the enormous and extremely ugly walrus men called Ulthorks and a
    variety of other creatures including frost giants, rygorr orcs, and rhino&#146;s. The
    hunting in this region is good, and relatively safe, so I had been here for at least the
    last few weeks, all the while hunting Ulthork Warriors. Everything was normal, just as it
    should be, just as it has been, for what seems like an eternity now. Me, alone, tracking
    one of the lumbering hulks across the snow-covered ground, preparing to launch an arrow or
    two just as soon as I saw it. When all of a sudden I hear a shout ring out through the
    crisp, cold air, &#147;What ho! My old friend!&#148; I turn slightly towards the sound and
    there but a short distance away, standing on a small hill, is the figure of a halfling.
    His blonde hair sticking haphazardly out from under the cap he is wearing, his green eyes
    shining in the sunlight, a huge smile on his face. The figure is very recognizable to me
    and instantly my mind starts racing, &#147;What the &#133;? How can this be?&#148; Not
    paying any attention, I lose my footing and stumble forward, landing face first in a small
    snow bank. A moment later he is there next to me, pulling me out of the snow, brushing me
    off. Slowly, I open my eyes and see a ghost from my past, &#147;Cecrops?&#148; I say. The
    look of concern leaves his face and is replaced by a broad smile, &#147;Temyez! My friend!
    How are you?&#148; He shouts, as he embraces me in a hug. I am confused, I am bewildered,
    I loosely hold on to him for a moment and then he pulls back looking at me with a smile.
    &#147;I,..&#133;but you&#146;re &#133;&#133;, someone said that you were &#133;..&#148; I
    stutter, unable to complete a sentence, staring at him with wide eyes. &#147;Rumors of my
    death have been greatly exaggerated,&#148; he says with a wink, smiling even wider, then
    laughing. I stare at him for a moment longer, this halfling that I haven&#146;t seen in
    ages, this good friend whom I have missed very much, sitting in the snow next to me
    laughing out loud. Then I too, begin laughing, and for the next few minutes we both laugh
    hysterically, rolling around in the snow like a couple of madmen. Afterwards, when we have
    both regained our senses, and composure, we sit for a short time talking, sharing some of
    the things that have happened to us. Even with the sharing there remain many questions in
    my mind, but Cecrops is anxious to explore this new land, he has heard rumors of the great
    treasures and riches that await adventurers here and he is eager to get started, and I
    know that all of my questions will be answered with time. The remainder of the day we
    spent hunting and exploring new areas, enjoying each other&#146;s friendship. Truthfully,
    I don&#146;t fully remember the events of the day, as it was so good to just travel and
    explore with a good friend. At some point later in the day Cecrops asked me if I would
    like to join him at a Solstice meeting of his Guild, I accepted, and shortly after we
    teleported to the Steamfont Mountains.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, sitting here surrounded by the members of
    Natural Selection, surrounded by my new family, I feel at home. My attention returns to
    the discussion at hand, something about a contest to collect the most hides from Warslikes
    Woods. Cecrops asks me if I will be coming along, &#147;No&#148; I reply, &#147;I really
    must rest my friend.&#148; He understands and takes my hand in his, congratulating me once
    again on becoming one of the family. Others approach and introduce themselves, welcoming
    me into the Guild, we exchange pleasantries, shaking hands, bowing to each other, hugging,
    until finally, the last one has left and I am alone again. The darkness is coming on
    quickly now, and my mind is still racing with all that has happened. I look up to the sky
    and feel the first of the tears as they break from my eyes and roll down my cheeks.
    Remembering all that I have lost, and all that I have gained, I say a quiet, &#147;Thank
    you Tunare, thank you Great Mother&#148; as I lower my head and cry. </font><font
