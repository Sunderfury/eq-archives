    and talked for a while on one of the outcroppings of rock along the coast. Her intellect
    is matched only by her great beauty and although we never fought side by side, I am quite
    sure that she is one of the most capable women I will ever meet. Regardless of the short
    time we spent together I consider her a friend and look forward to the day when I might
    gaze upon her lovely face again and share another discussion or perhaps travel together
    for a time. Until then I pray to Tunare, the Giver of all beauty, for her safety and
    happiness.</font></small></td>
