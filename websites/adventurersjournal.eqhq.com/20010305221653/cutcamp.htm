    <small>Cutthroat camps are located in the Commonlands and deserts of the eastern continent
    of Antonica. The cutthroats are similar to the bandits of the west although they come in
    all shapes and sizes, some human, some orc, some others.&nbsp; Some are spellcasters and
    some are warriors, they can be dangerous and should be approached with caution.</small></td>
