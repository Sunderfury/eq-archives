    alot of travelling, and it struck me one day that I should be keeping a written journal.
    So, here is a written record of my travels, started on the 6th day of June in the year
    3180. I won't bore you with every aspect of my life but I will try to write down the most
    notable. I am currently a Ranger at the 16th level of the Rangers Guild and I only wish
    that I had started this journal much sooner in my life, but alas, I cannot change the
    past, only look to a better future.</font></td>

    I recently made my first trip to Befallen. A foul, dirty place full of undead creatures
    and evil beasts. The smell of death lingers in the air as you enter the ancient halls of
    marble. You instantly get a sense of the evil that permeates the dungeon as you walk into
    the open room beyond the entry hall. Human skulls mounted on podiums along the wall
    instill a deep fear in your bones, the dark gloom only adding to the eeriness of the
    place. I could hear and see that there were other adventurers here, perhaps looking for
    some of the treasure that I hoped to find. The upper levels of the dungeon were populated
    with undead and beasts of a very low level, so I decided right away that I would have to
    go deeper if I was to find anything worth while. After talking with a small group of
    warriors, I found out that the doors to the lower levels of the dungeon are locked and a
    key must be obtained from a guardian before advancing deeper. So I set off to find this
    guardian and obtain my first key. I found him in a side room, a dark elf shadow knight, he
    was inexperienced and fell quickly to my attack, on his body I found the key that I
    needed. Using this key, I quickly descended to the next lower level and found my self
    facing creatures that were much more formidable. Thinking it would be wise to have some
    help, I joined up with a wandering band of adventurers who were heading off to find the
    key to the third level. We fought our way through skeletons, zombies, ghouls, and
    necromancers to the area where the guardian could be found. Upon entering the room we
    found it to be empty, where the guardian was I do not know, perhaps checking on his undead
    minions, we all hid in the shadows and waited for his return. A short time passed and the
    guardian returned, accompanied by a couple of his unholy necromancers. Screaming a battle
    cry I engaged the enemy, myself and another went directly for the guardian, an ogre shadow
    knight, while the rest of our group engaged the spellcasters. The guardian fought madly
    but could not defeat the two of us, he fell quickly in a battered heap. The spellcasters
    were defeated by the rest of the group shortly after and while everyone was resting and
    looting the bodies, I found one of treasures that I had hoped for, a pair of barbed
    armplates from the ogre shadow knight. Magical armor that not only protects me, but also
    enhances my abilities. I was told by a member of this group that it is rumored that a
    matching pair of magical legplates may be found deeper in the dungeon. Alas, the group was
    tired and we decided that we would leave this evil place, however I made a vow to return
    here someday and attempt to find the matching magical legplates that I had heard of.</font></td>
