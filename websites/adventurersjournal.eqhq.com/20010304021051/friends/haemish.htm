    <big>I met Haemish a long time ago and from the very first time I met him I felt an
    instant connection with him. Beyond being just another Ranger he became a good friend and
    confidant, someone that I could talk to when I needed to, someone that I could fight
    beside with honor. I am proud to be able to call him a friend and although he has moved on
    to other adventures and now belongs to another Guild, I still consider him to be a Brother
    to me and I always will.<br>
    I thank Tunare for bringing someone of such character and honor into my life as an example
    to me of how one should live.</big></font></td>
