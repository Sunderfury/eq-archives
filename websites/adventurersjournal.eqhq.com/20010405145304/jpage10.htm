    The Giant came rushing out of the trees at us waving his huge club wildly in the air,
    yelling something I could neither hear nor understand. I was dumbstruck, unable to move as
    it closed in on us. It was huge, I had heard of giants of course, but I had no idea that
    they were this big. Standing taller than most of trees in the area, it seemed impossible
    to me that something this large could move that quickly. I was immediately grabbed by the
    arm and jerked backwards, out of the corner of my eye I saw my father leaping towards the
    giant. Thrown behind an outcropping of rock I heard my mother begin casting, weaving the
    words of magic together as she made the ancient signs with her hands. I peered out from
    behind the rocks and saw my father engaged in battle with the creature, his huge sword
    cutting and slicing while he nimbly avoided crushing blows of the giants club. I could see
    that the giant&#146;s right leg had a huge gash in it and blood poured out soaking the
    ground, yet the giant himself seemed to not notice as the battle waged on. Suddenly a
    light blue aura enveloped my father and his movements were quickened, as my mothers spell
    took hold of him he became nothing more than a blur as he worked his dance of death around
    the giant. My mother continued to cast, this time raining poison down on the giant, its
    skin bubbling and smoking where the rain fell. It bellowed in rage and pain as my parents
    continued to assault it from everywhere. Finally, my father drove his sword through the
    giant&#146;s lower back and it toppled forward, landing with a dull thud on the ground. My
    father turned towards us to see that we were all right. As I stood up from behind the rock
    I could hear my mother screaming but I couldn&#146;t understand, I looked up and saw the
    giants club come swinging across the ground and smash into my fathers back. The sound as
    it hit him was terrible, the sound of cracking bones, he was thrown violently to the
    ground just as a massive bolt of lightning struck what remained of the giant. I had never
    heard my mothers casting because I had been screaming, screaming for my father, screaming
    for him to watch out, screaming, screaming, screaming.<br>
    I awoke suddenly, screaming loudly into the dark, sweat covered my body, and I was shaking
    violently. I quickly looked around into the darkness, my scream echoed back, nothing
    there, nothing but the sounds of the night. Tears welled up in my eyes, lifting my head to
    the night sky I yelled for Tunare to remove the pain, to take away the memories.
    &quot;Please Tunare, please help me&quot;, I said. As if in answer the wind howled as I
    lowered my head into my hands and wept.</font></td>
