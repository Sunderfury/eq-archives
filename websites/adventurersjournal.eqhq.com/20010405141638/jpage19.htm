    Once again I have found some papers belonging to the lovely, gifted, and beautiful Lady
    Siniana mixed among mine. I know not if they are there by accident or if perhaps the Lady
    secretly puts them with mine so I might find them. If she does hide them, I pray that she
    learns soon that she need not hide anything from me, for I Love Her completely just as she
    is. My body burns for her and her touch when I read this and think of her. I pray she
    forgives me for publishing her private journal entries and I hope she understands why I
    had to. The writings below are from her, written in her hand, and not changed in any way;</font><p><big><font

    Today, the guild is battling in Solusek A, for our beloved Brother Conwen, and alas,
    during the battle my spirit has left me. So, while I wait for Brother Klymeth to revive my
    soul, I am going to finish this piece I have been working on for dear Temy. It is so quiet
    and peaceful here in Butcherblock that I think I will be able to give it to him today. I
    certainly hope that he likes it, for I have been adding to it since the day I have first
    made his acquaintance. Oh Tunare, please let things continue to grow between us so that we
    may have the strongest bond of love ever noted in Norrath. My heart truly does only beat
    for him if you shall make it so.... </font></big></p>

    I'll be the one to heal your pain </font></big></p>
