    of Marr<br>
    </strong><small>The Oasis of Marr is the region located between the Northern and Southern
    Desert of Ro. It holds many dangers for the unprepared and the prepared adventurer alike.
    Sand giants roam the area along with a multitude of other creatures including desert
    madmen, orcs, cutthroats, tarantulas, crocodiles, pumas, and many types of undead
    creatures. There is a lake roughly in the center with an island containing high level
    spectres, the lake is also home to underwater goblins. There is also an Inn, a gypsy
    village, and a fishing village for selling and buying merchandise. If you plan to travel
    into or through the oasis stay near the coast on the Eastern shore, it is relatively safe
    and there are rock pillars slightly offshore where you can rest and recouperate. Be
    extremely careful in the Oasis of Marr, always try to know where you are and what is
    around you.</small></td>
