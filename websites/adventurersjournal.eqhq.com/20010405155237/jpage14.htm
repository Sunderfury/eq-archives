    Looking around the area it seems that the creatures that built these structures would have
    some intelligence, however they don&#146;t seem to show any. Or maybe it is simply a
    different kind of intelligence, one that I don&#146;t understand. <br>
    I have been travelling in the Southern Karana area for quite some time, I have been in
    many battles with the Aviaks, the bird people, yet they seem to hold no hostility towards
    me. I am free to approach any and all of them and they will not attack first. A passing
    Aviak will join in combat if you are in battle with another of their kind, so perhaps I
    misjudge them, alas I do not know. The leader of these bird people, Krak Windchaser, is
    the only one who has ever spoken to me. He simply stated that he would have no dealings
    with me or my kind, Saying that my people, the Half Elves, had destroyed their homeland
    and he wouldn&#146;t have them destroying his. Had I been stronger I may have killed him
    for that, but alas at the time I was no match for him. Even now, at the 25<sup>th</sup>
    level of the Ranger&#146;s Guild I doubt if I could do much damage to him.<br>
    Yet, as I stare at the main structure, a great building situated high in an immense tree,
    I think that perhaps I do misjudge them, perhaps they are intelligent after all, for there
    certainly had to be some intelligence involved to build such a structure. Or perhaps long
    ago the Aviaks were a much smarter race, maybe even possessing the ability to fly, and
    somehow over the course of many years, had degenerated to this particular type of birdman.
    I do not know, I only know that I must continue my journey towards the destiny that Tunare
    holds for me.<p>While travelling through this area I have also had the opportunity to
    engage the gnolls that have taken over the Splitpaw. They are a deadly foe compared to the
    white gnolls that used to live in the Paw. These new gnolls, the Tec Mas Gnolls, as they
    have come to be known are much larger and stronger than the others are. They fight better
    and have much better weapons and armor than old Splitpaw Gnolls. I have been unable to
    battle any of the gnolls alone as they have been much to strong for me, however the day
    approaches soon when I will be able to defeat one of the Tec Mas gnolls in single combat.
    As you make your way across the land, you would be wise to be very careful when traveling
    through their territory.</font></td>
