    <font size="2" face="Tempus Sans ITC">I met the beautiful Athene on the western plains
    very early in both our adventures. We fought together in a small group for a few days. I
    doubt that she even remembers me, however I shall never forget her as she is one of the
    most beautiful women that I have met. She is a skilled fighter and a great contributer to
    the welfare of all group members. I hope someday to meet her again, and adventure with her
    throughout the realms. Until then, I Pray to the Great Tunare for her welfare and
    happiness.</font></td>
