    <small>Split Paw or Infected Paw, as it is otherwise known, is the lair of the white
    knolls. It is located on the Southern&nbsp; Karanas Plains and I think it's a great place
    to hunt for a couple of reasons, first there are very few people there at any one time,
    second the money, weapons and items are very good. I recommend at least level 9 for
    hunting in this dungeon, I didn't start hunting here until level 10. Any items that you
    find here can be sold at the Centuar village located to the Northeast or the Aviak village
    located to the South.</small></td>
