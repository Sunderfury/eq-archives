    the western plains. We hunted together for a few hours and did very well against every
    manner of beast. He seemed concerned for my health on a number of occasions, during battle
    he would tell me to back off when he saw my health going low and for that I thank him. I
    believe him to be a good man, genuinely concerned for the safety and well being of others.
    May the Supreme healer, Tunare, Mother of all, keep you well while you travel.</font></td>
