    I met on the western plains and fought for a short time together in a group. The first
    time that I saw her I thought she was gorgeous and I am sure that she has gotten more
    beautiful with time. She is a strong person, perfectly capable of upholding her end of the
    group responsibilities and doing it quite well I might add. I have not seen her in a long
    time, Perhaps some day we shall meet again, until then I ask Tunare the giver of all
    beauty to keep her safe from harm in her travels.</font></td>
