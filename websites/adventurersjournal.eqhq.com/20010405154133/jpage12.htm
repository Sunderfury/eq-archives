    What a wonderful day, I have finally achieved level 22 in the ranger&#146;s guild. All
    Praise Tunare, She continues to look after me always. I have spoken to my guild master and
    received the instruction needed to use a new stronger set of spells. With these spells I
    will be able to progress much faster and travel much safer. Some of the spells available
    to me now are &#145;Skin like Rock&#146; which will give me more protection and
    &#145;Light Healing&#146; which will allow me to regenerate my health much faster. A spell
    called &#145;Enduring Breath&#146; which allows me to breath underwater and a more
    powerful attack spell called &#145;Ignite&#146;. I truly look forward to using these new
    spells in battle and in my general travels throughout Norrath. I also received further
    instruction in the skill of foraging, although I am fairly good at this skill already, the
    better I get the more food I can find in the wilderness and the longer I can travel
    without stopping at merchants. I would advise any young rangers to build this skill as
    much as possible for it becomes invaluable later in your journeys. <br>
    Now it is time to focus my energies on obtaining all the pieces of the Ivy Etched Armor. I
    have two of the components for the bracer and need only save enough platinum to purchase
    the gem needed and I can at least get one of them. After getting both of the bracers I
    will probably travel to Castle Mistmoore once again to try to collect the piece needed for
    the Helm. Soon, Tunare willing I will be wearing all of the Ivy Armor.</font></td>
