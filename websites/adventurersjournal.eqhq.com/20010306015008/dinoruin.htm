    </strong><small>The remains of a giant dragon lay here, probably where it fell dead from
    some huge battle of the past. The ruins can be found in the Eastern part of the Steamfont
    Mountains. The area is filled with undead and the occasional roaming kobold and rogue
    clockwork. Travelers should beware that there aren't more of these huge giants around for
    they could swallow even the strongest adventurer whole.</small></td>
