    Leaving Lake Rathe behind me, I move forward into the mountains. The sun is shining full
    from high in the sky and yet it is still very cool as I progress into the pass. I have
    come seeking a certain charm, the charm of Tarskuk the Cyclops. It is needed by one of the
    leaders of the Rangers Guild in Kithicor Woods to make the Ivy Etched Helmet. This helmet
    is quite a piece of armor, it provides protection and also adds magical enhancements to
    the wearer. I do wish to have the helmet, but somehow I do not think that Tarskuk will
    just hand over his charm, so I fear that I will have quite a battle ahead of me. My hope
    is that I will find a small band of adventurers to join up with along the way for I will
    be unable to defeat a Cyclops alone, but if I can&#146;t find anyone to join with then I
    will at least scout the area.<br>
    As I make my way out of the pass I see great mountains rising and between them vast areas
    of flatlands. There are many creatures roaming the area. I can see giant skeletons in the
    distance, kodiak bears, lizardmen, and basilisks, there are also signs and tracks of hill
    giants. Examining the hill giant tracks my mind is flooded with images. Images of my
    broken and battered father lying beside a dead giant. Images of my screaming mother
    running to my father. I can feel the tears welling up, &quot;No&quot; I say, as I lower my
    head, &quot;I will not let this happen now.&quot; Fighting back the tears I focus on why I
    am here, Tarskuk, the charm, yes, I have come for the charm and I must remain on track.<br>
    From somewhere close by I hear a twig snap, ducking and turning while I draw my sword and
    dagger I see a lizardman warrior staring at me from a small distance. He is sizing me up,
    deciding if he might be able to defeat me in battle. Standing, I point my dagger at him
    and flick the tip upward in somewhat of a rude gesture, he hisses and runs away. The
    lizardmen here are no match for me, they will keep their distance if they know what&#146;s
    good for them.<br>
    Crossing over a ridge I am caught unaware by a giant skeleton, the creature immediately
    starts towards me. Speaking quickly I cast a snare spell on it and instantly the skeletons
    movements are slowed. Pulling my bow I send an arrow into its dead eyeball, the creature
    doesn&#146;t even slow down. The undead are nasty, already dead they are even harder to
    kill the second time around. The creature kicks at me with its boney foot, I easily dodge
    the blow and hack off its leg at the knee. Somewhat off balance it swings at me with a
    clawed hand, I block the swing and move around behind, saying the ancient words of magic,
    the creature is rocked as the explosion of fire from my ignite spell goes off right in its
    chest. The skeleton falls as it tries to turn, lifting its arm it swings towards me, my
    sword finds the crease at its elbow and slices easily through the dried tendons separating
    its lower arm from the remainder of its body. After a few more minutes the giant skeleton
    has been reduced to a large pile of bones, its one eye stares up at me from its socket.
    Removing my arrow from the other eye I crush the skull under my boot, stomping the dried
    bones into a pile of dust.<br>
    Moving deeper into the mountains I find many tracks of Cyclops, the creatures roam freely
    here. It will be very hard to track down this Tarskuk. Climbing up on a ridge I look down
    and see a group of adventurers hunting skeletons and Cyclops. What luck, perhaps they can
    help me find what I seek. Running down the hill, I approach the group &quot;Greetings
    Friends&quot; I say, &quot;Greetings&quot; replies a tall, thin wizard. &quot;I see you
    have been hunting Cyclops, I too am hunting a Cyclops, his name is Tarskuk.&quot; The
    wizard replies &quot;I know nothing of this Tarskuk, what makes this Clops so
    special?&quot; &quot;He wears a charm, nothing more than a rock really, but very important
    to me&quot; I said. A gnome from the group stepped forward &quot;I saw some kind of charm
    around the neck of one of these clops we have killed, I left it on the body as it
    didn&#146;t look to be worth anything, you may have it if you find it.&quot; Could it be?
    Could the charm I seek be so close? Checking the many corpses I finally find it, the rune
    of ivy hanging from the neck of the Great Tarskuk. Cutting the leather that holds the
    rune, I hold it up to the sky, the sun reflects off the smooth black surface and shoots
    beams of light onto the ground. As I walk away with the rune in my pack I can&#146;t help
    but think that good things are in store for me, Tunare continues to look after me as I
    continue my journey towards my destiny.</font></td>
