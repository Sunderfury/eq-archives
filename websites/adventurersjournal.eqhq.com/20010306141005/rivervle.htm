    Antonica. You will find the city between the misty thicket and the kithicor woods. It is a
    pleasant little city to visit and rest after a long journey, the halflings seem nice
    enough and you can buy many supplies and weapons here. There are docks for fishing and a
    pub where you can drink an ale and listen to a stories of fellow travellers or tell some
