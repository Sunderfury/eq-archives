    the following entry. The first half was written by the Lady Siniana and the second by me,
    you should be able to tell when the writing styles change. Why is it like that you might
    ask, the answer is quite simple, I Love her.</big></font><p><font face="Lucida Sans"><big>August
    4</big><br>
    <big>I sat at the edge of the lake, the wind was gently splashing against the water as it
    lapped to the shore. I pulled my knees up against my chest and took a deep breath. This
    was my first visit to this strange land that everyone calls Kunark, and so far, the
    desolation and silence at the lake was welcoming. I watched as the moon began to set and
    the sun rise on the horizon. Morning was finally here, and I smiled as I watched the
    clouds turn into deep hues of purple, pink, and orange. Somewhat wistfully, I wished
    someone was here with me, and from the way my heart raced in my chest, I knew who I wanted
    to be there. I sighed, for I had not spoken to Temyez in a few days and I doubted he knew
    where I was. I rested my head on my knees and watched as the sunrise became brighter and I
    could feel the heat of the sun seep across the land. I closed my eyes and lost myself in a
    daydream, just enjoying the peace and quiet. </big></font></p>
    <p><big><font face="Lucida Sans">Suddenly, I felt a strong hand rest against my back, as I
    sat my body up straight, two strong arms wrapped themselves around me. A familiar scent
    was in the air, and I smiled for I knew immediately who it was. Warm breath surrounded my
    ear as I heard him whisper, &#147;M&#146;love, I have missed you for so long. Tis good to
    have you in my arms again.&#148; I smiled and clasped my hands over his. He pulled me
    closer to him and we sat in the grass, watching the sun rise and enjoying each
    other&#146;s company. Temyez always amazes me at how we can be completely satisfied just
    being near each other, no words having to be exchanged. It was as though our thoughts were
    one, and there was no need to break the moment with sounds. He ran his fingers through my
    hair and I felt myself start to get drowsy, his hands comforting my tired mind. So much
    had happened in the last few weeks and I hadn&#146;t slept well in months, being plagued
    by terrible nightmares and insomnia. I think he knew what I was going through and just
    wanted to be here, to hold me, and let me know that I was safe. It felt good to just lie
    there with him, like he was a sturdy wall and the world could do nothing to bring me harm.
    I snuggled closer to him, and soon, drifted off into a peaceful sleep. </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Lucida Sans">I awoke to the sounds of a crackling fire and the smell
    of food cooking. I sat up and noticed a rose and a note laying near the blanket. I grinned
    as I smelled the rose and picked up the scroll to read these words, written in
    Temyez&#146;s fine print: </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">When I am with you,<br>
    My body is a vessel,<br>
    that allows me to feel you,<br>
    To touch you,<br>
    To share with you,<br>
    To be with you. </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">But when we are apart,<br>
    My body becomes a prison,<br>
    That keeps my soul from you,<br>
    It cries out for you,<br>
    Reaching For you,<br>
    To be with you. </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">It waits to be a vessel again,<br>
    To be free in you. </font></big></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC"><big>Love,</big><br>
    <big>Temy </big></font></p>
    <p><big><font face="Lucida Sans">My heart felt as though it had just grown wings and I
    picked up the rose to go stand near the warm fire. I did not see Temyez anywhere in sight,
    but I hoped he would return. I noticed a small jug of wine sitting near the fire and I
    poured myself a small drink. I walked over to the edge of the lake and drank the wine
    slowly, feeling much better than I had in months. The sun was beginning to set in the sky,
    my goodness, I had slept through most of the day? I turned back to the fire and noticed
    Temyez had returned. He sat on the ground, and I noticed that he had been watching me. As
    I turned, he pretended to be stirring the fire and it made me giggle. &#147;M&#146;lady,
    you are so beautiful, especially in the light of a fire.&#148; he said quietly. I blushed,
    and said &#147;And you, m&#146;lord, are especially handsome.&#148; He stood, and reached
    his hand out to mine. I offered mine in return, and he pulled me closer to him, our faces
    only inches apart. He looked deep into my eyes and I felt a small shiver run down my
    spine. I just loved his eyes, such a dark green that I had never seen before in all the
    lands of Norrath. He took the glass of wine from me and set it down, and wrapped his arms
    about my waist. I placed my arms around his neck and kissed him tenderly. He responded
    warmly, and his embrace tightened around me. We lost ourselves in the moment, but soon
    remembered that dinner was cooking on the fire&#133;..</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">.....Our lips hesitantly parted and for a long moment
    he stared into my eyes, it seemed that he needed to say something, that it hung just on
    the tip of his tongue, but then he turned to attend the rabbit that was cooking over the
    fire. She watched him as he stoked the fire and turned the meat, she wanted to ask him
    what, if anything was wrong. He had always been open with her and never hid his feelings,
    but now she felt something may be wrong. She walked over to her blanket and sat down,
    picking up the rose she held it in her hand and smiled. Looking over at Temyez she noticed
    him staring at her again, he looked happy with a smile on his face, but she thought she
    could see a slight worry about him. &#147;M&#146;lord, is there something wrong? Are you
    alright?&#148; He lowered his head and stood up slowly, He raised his head again and
    locked his eyes on hers as he began walking to her. Kneeling down in front of her he took
    the rose from her hand and laid it down on the blanket, he took his hand and gently
    touched her cheek. His eyes slowly scanned her face, seeming to take a mental image of it
    so he might never forget, before he finally stared deep into her eyes. &#147;Oh
    M&#146;lady, I don&#146;t know what to do, you see I have never felt this way
    before.&#148; He lifted her hand to his lips and softly kissed it while he closed his
    eyes. Lowering her hand once again he took both of her hands in his and looked into her
    eyes once more, &#147;I have fallen for you Lady, you fill my mind and thoughts every
    waking moment. I desire nothing more than to be with you every moment of every day. My
    heart is so full for you it feels like it may burst at any moment. Yet, our lives are so
    complicated, circumstances are so varied, paths are different, I don&#146;t know what I am
    to do.&#148; A single tear rolled down his cheek as he continued to speak his heart,
    &#147;This note that I wrote you M&#146;love, it is the truth, without you I am but a
    prisoner in my own body, an empty shell.&#148; His eyes searched hers for an answer,
    &#147;I truly know now that I love you Lady, there is nothing else but you for me, so what
    am I to do?&#148; She reached up and touched his face with her hand as she looked at him.
    She was speechless, unable to speak in the wake of this man openly baring his soul to her.
    Taking his face in her hands she pulled him into her, their lips meeting as their tongues
    intertwined. The fire, the food, the entire world was forgotten, their passions carried
    them through the night. Many hours later, as they lay together under the blankets, the
    Lady sleeping peacefully in his arms, the ranger said a quiet prayer, &#147;Thank you
    Tunare, you have truly blessed me.&#148; Smiling he pulled her closer, softly kissing her
    forehead, and closed his eyes to sleep.</font></big></td>
