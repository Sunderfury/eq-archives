    Thicket<br>
    </strong><small>The wall runs through the middle of the Misty Thicket and acts as a
    barrier to the many beasts that otherwise might find thier way into the homes of the
    halflings behind the wall. There is only one way through and it is usually guarded by
    halflings. The Misty Thicket is a relatively low level area, although the farther you get
    from the wall the more dangerous it gets. Stay on guard and keep your eyes open and you
    should be alright.</small></td>
