    The Goddess Tunare herself has allowed me to advance in the rangers guild, I have been
    promoted to a ranger of the 17th season, what a glorious day! I have been taught the
    secrets of wielding two weapons at the same time and have abandoned my shield for a second
    weapon, I will currently wield a minotaurs axe and a combine longsword.</font><p><font
    face="Tempus Sans ITC">My guild brother Valint has asked me to meet him in the High Pass
    Hold to battle rogue orcs who are on the war path. After meeting him in the pass, we
    battled for a short time. but there were many adventurers there, and not many orcs, so the
    pickings were slim. Later that day brother Valint had some other business to attend to and
    I decided to move on to another area.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Wielding two weapons is fantastic, although I have a long
    way to go until I am very effective at it, I can already see a large improvement in my
    battles. I have been thinking about the type of weapons that I should be using, perhaps a
    smaller, faster weapon in my right hand would be better than this axe. I will have to ask
    some others what kinds of smaller weapons are available.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Guild brother Klymeth has asked me to help a friend of his
    complete a small quest. The quest is in the region of Everfrost and I have been wanting to
    see the lengendary Permafrost Dungeon anyways, so off we go to help. The quest was
    successful and brother Klymeth's friend now has a new weapon, a Langseax of the wolves, I
    believe it was called. It can only be wielded by a warrior and is very powerful. I
    immediatly headed for Permafrost, to see whatever might be seen there. I can tell you
    this, Permafrost Dungeon is a frightful place, located in the northern most reaches of the
    land. A cold and unforgiving place, Its entrance is guarded by frost giants who oppose all
    who would enter. Once inside you are attacked by the hordes of goblins that live in the
    dungeon. I never made it farther than the entrance hall before another adventurer went
    running for his life past me, heading for the exit, with a very large trail of goblins
    following right behind him. About half of the goblins turned towards me and I hightailed
    it out of there as quick as I could. This dungeon was not for a lone hunter, so I decided
    I would return another day with some of my guild members to explore the frozen wastes of
    the Permafrost and maybe retrieve some of the treasure I have heard about.</font></td>
