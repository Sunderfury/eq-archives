    western plains very early in both our adventures. We fought together in a small group for
    a few days. I doubt that she even remembers me, however I shall never forget her as she is
    one of the most beautiful women that I have met. She is a skilled fighter and a great
    contributer to the welfare of all group members. I hope someday to meet her again, and
    adventure with her throughout the realms. Until then, I Pray to the Great Tunare for her
    welfare and happiness.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>UPDATE</strong> - As luck would have it, or perhaps fate. I have once again met up
    with this lovely Lady. As a matter of fact she is now my Guild Sister and I am very
    honored to have an opportunity to get to know her once again. She has managed to become
    even more beautiful since I last saw her so many years ago in our youth, and her skills
    have increased one hundred fold. I had always wished to be reunited with her someday and
    The Great Mother has granted my wish.&nbsp; I still recall how my heart jumped so long ago
    when I first saw her and got to know her a little, and I am reminded of that fact
    regularly as it still beats faster when I see her now.</font></td>
