    I have switched my minotaurs axe for a smaller and faster weapon, a dragoon dirk. I got
    the dirk by killing Lord D'vinn at the Castle Crushbone, it was not an easy task, but well
    worth the trouble. The day that I arrived in Crushbone I could feel that something good
    was going to happen, Tunare was with me strongly and I was well rested, the formation of
    the guild was moving ahead very well, everything seemed to be going my way and I had high
    hopes that it would continue to do so. Upon entering the Crushbone area I began to slowly
    make my way towards the castle where I knew I would find the Ambassador D'vinn. I moved
    cautiously knowing that although there were many other adventurers around, there were
    still many orcs and one orc can call many others, so it is best to be careful. While I was
    moving towards the castle, I came upon a group of adventurers who were also heading to the
    castle, Their target was the Emperor Crush himself. After talking a few minutes with them,
    we joined forces to accomplish both of our missions. We discussed at length the best way
    to achieve our goals, and decided that we would enter the castle at night to allow
    ourselves the best cover and use the shadows to our advantage. We located an area at the
    base of a large hill that afforded us a view of the entrance to the castle and waited for
    nightfall. Our wait was not long and before we knew it the night was upon us. Casting
    invisibility spells upon ourselves we made our way to the front doors and opened them, I
    tell you it is quite a funny sight to see the face of an orc when he is watching a door
    open by itself, I had to stop myself from laughing out loud, we entered and stuck to the
    shadows as we made our way deeper inside. The castle itself is remarkably small inside,
    perhaps a magical spell is used to make it look bigger from the outside, whatever the
    reason we were in the main chamber within minutes, no one was there, the throne sat empty,
    all the guards were out with the Emperor, the place was quiet. In a small alcove off the
    main chamber I noticed a staircase, I signaled the rest of the group and we started up, as
    we reached the top it opened up into a small tower room, Ambassador D'vinn was here
    looking out the tower windows, we charged him immediately not wanting to give up the
    element of surprise. In an instant he turned, his weapons drawn, and engaged us in battle,
    he showed no fear though he was outnumbered, his face leering and grinning, full of hate
    and evil. He was impossibly fast, dodging most of my blows and dealing out much &nbsp;
    damage with his dagger, without the help of the wizards in our group I fear he would have
    killed some if not all of us. I am happy to say that we were to much for him, and he
    finally fell, defeated. I picked up his blood soaked dagger and felt instantly uplifted,
    It was a perfectly balanced weapon and also magically enhanced, for as I poked it through
    the air I could see that my movements were much quicker. What a weapon, a magical dagger
    that increased the speed of the user, it would be a fine addition to my arsenal. As we
    split up the gold coin, we heard noises from downstairs, the Emperor had returned and it
    was time for us to introduce ourselves. We waited a few minutes to rest and recuperate and
    then silently slid down the stairs to the main chamber, the Emperor sat on his throne with
    a mage by his side and a guard or two by the door, it was obvious that they expected no
    trouble from our direction and as we rushed into the room you could see the surprise on
    all their faces. We went directly after Emperor Crush and his mage wanting to put them
    down as quickly as possible, the guards joined in immediately instead of calling for help,
    that turned out to be a fatal mistake. As the battle waged on, one of the guards ran for
    the door to get help, it was too late, the Emperor and his mage went down in a pool of
    blood. The guard was just opening the door frantically screaming for help when I took aim
    with my bow and stuck an arrow through the back of his neck pinning him against the door,
    more guards were arriving by the second and as they struggled to get through the blocked
    door, we decided to make a hasty retreat up the steps to the tower. As we reached the top
    of the tower we could hear the enraged screams of the guards as they found their Emperor
    dead on the floor, rather than face all the guards in our weakened state, we all jumped
    out the tower windows into the moat below, making a hasty retreat into the darkness of the
    forest. When we finally stopped to rest, one of the warriors showed me the chain mail
    tunic he had taken off the Emperor Crush before we had retreated, it was a fine piece of
    armor and if I'm not mistaken it was also magically enhanced.</font></td>
