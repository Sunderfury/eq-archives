    first met Klymeth outside the city of Kelethin. He wanted to start a guild and we spoke at
    length about it, deciding that night that we would start &quot;The Holy Order of
    Tunare&quot;.<br>
    Since that day he has become a great friend to me. Both encouraging and thoughtful his
    compassion for others knows no end and I have seen him sacrifice himself to save another.
    I value his friendship above all else and thank Tunare for bringing us together.<br>
    I pray to the Great Mother that she always watch out for him and keep him safe.</font></td>
