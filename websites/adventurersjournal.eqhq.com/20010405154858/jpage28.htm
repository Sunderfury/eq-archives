    face="Tempus Sans ITC">Slowly he opened his eyes, the soft light from the morning greeted
    him, gently stirring his senses. Sitting up, he wipes the sleep from his eyes and looks
    around his room. It is sparse, with barely any decorations to distinguish it from any
    other room, but that is the way he likes it, simple, plain, functional. Getting out of bed
    he starts thinking about all the things that have happened in this room, all the
    discussions that occurred here, all the Love that was shared here, his head starts
    pounding again as more thoughts come to him. He hadn&#146;t slept well last night, as a
    matter of fact he hasn&#146;t slept well for quite a while now, ever since he had returned
    from Kunark, so he is moving rather slowly this morning. As he goes about his morning
    routine, the thoughts of this place keep filling his head, not only thoughts of this room,
    but also thoughts of the entire Guildhall. Ever since his return he has had many thoughts,
    but no feelings, his heart has been seemingly turned to stone. Recently he has been
    thinking about what he must do, what action he must take in the face of all that happened.
    He has considered all the possibilities and has come to one single conclusion, one course
    of action that seems inevitable, inescapable. This morning he has decided that he would
    take that action, and so all these memories keep flooding in, all these experiences keep
    filling his head, and the pain in his head grows with the memories.<br>
    As he leaves his room he notices that the place seems empty, deserted. He is not concerned
    for it is late morning and everyone has probably already gone for the day, &quot;All the
    better&quot; he thinks to himself. When he reaches the main hall he sits down at the table
    to write a letter, a letter he has been putting off writing, but which now must be
    written. As he sits there thinking about the wording of the letter he is flooded with
    memories. Memories of this place, of the things that have happened to him over his life,
    of the people he has met, the places he has been. The pain in his head grows from a mild
    throbbing to a tremendous thumping almost as if someone is beating on his head. He lifts
    his hands up to his head to try and fend off the pain, his eyes scanning the room seeing
    the ghosts of his memories everywhere he looks. He is overwhelmed by the memories, the
    images filling his mind, the pain in his head an unbearable, steady assault on him. He
    looks up and a single tear breaks from his eye and rolls down his cheek, and with that
    tear he hears a loud cracking sound from inside his chest, the pain in his head disappears
    instantly and suddenly he is overcome with emotion. His entire body fills with it like a
    glass being filled with water, the anger, the frustration, the sorrow, the pity, all of it
    returns in that one instant, shocking his system for a moment. He is once again filled
    with Love, and then filled with pain, the pain and sorrow for what he is about to do. The
    tears come bursting out of him like water from a broken dam. He bends over and sobs like a
    child, unable to control himself. For weeks he has been without these emotions, he has
    been a stone, unfeeling, uncaring. Now in an instant these feelings have returned and he
    is laid to waste by the awesome power that they carry. As he slowly regains some composure
    over himself, he remembers why he is here and what he is about to do, and the pain in his
    heart grows larger, the anguish of what he is feeling right now as he realizes that this
    changes nothing, that he still must do what he has set out to do, and so he turns and
    begins writing even as the tears continue to flow.</font></big><p><big><font

    <i><p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">It is with a very sad, and heavy heart that I must
    do the following, but I see no other course of action that will allow me to continue. Due
    to recent events and circumstances beyond my control, I must resign my position as the
    First Officer of the Holy Order of Tunare.<br>
    It brings much pain to my heart to have to do this, but the pain I already carry is much
    greater and staying would simply bring more of it, which I don&#146;t think I could
    endure. I would like to say that I have been most honored to represent you all as one of
    your leaders. Each and every one of you has brought happiness, joy, and honor to my life,
    in your own unique way. The friendships that I have developed with some of you are more
    like extensions of my own family, indeed, I truly consider some of you to be my kin. Even
    those of you whom I do not know very well, I still consider to be my friends. I hope that
    these friendships will continue to be there, for losing them would make this already
    unbearable situation even worse.<br>
    I want everyone to know that I am terribly sorry for this, and I wish that there was some
    other way, but alas, I can see none. I wish all of you the very best that life has to
    offer, for each and every one of you deserve it and so much more.</font></big></p>
    </i><p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&nbsp;Standing and removing the Emblem of the
    First Officer of The Holy Order of Tunare from his tunic and placing it on the table, he
    takes one last look around the Guild Hall, tears streaming down his face. Bowing deeply,
    he stops for a moment near the tree in the entranceway, wiping his face and straightening
    his tunic, he turns and walks slowly out the door.</font></big></td>
