    </strong><small>The Lavastorm Mountains located in the North Eastern region of the
    continent Antonica is a rough and barren place. Creatures such as Fire elementals, fire
    Imps, fire goblins, fire drakes, basilisks and dervishes can be found here. This area can
    be extremely dangerous not only because of the creatures, but also because of the many
    pools of lava which is an extremely hazardous substance, falling into a pool of lava can
    mean a very quick death with very little chance of corpse recovery. When hunting here you
    should be extremely careful. The Temple of Solusek Ro and the entrance to Najena can be
    found in this region.</small></td>
