    I could sense the change in Kithicor forest as I approached. In the weeks past a portal to
    the plane of hate had opened here and the denizens of evil had poured forth. The forest
    had gone from a quiet place of rest and relaxation to a place of death and destruction. As
    I came out of the mountain trail from Highpass I could see the recent victims of this
    newfound place of evil. Four corpses were laying about the area, filling the air with the
    stench of rotting flesh. I stopped and carefully studied the area, trying to determine if
    whatever had killed these hapless travelers might still be lurking around waiting for more
    victims. I listened carefully for a few minutes but heard only the sounds of the wind and
    the woods. Upon closer inspection of the corpses I could see that they had been killed as
    much as a day earlier, oh how many other travelers had passed by these bodies and done
    nothing? How much death does one have to look at to become numb to its effects? How much
    destruction before you just don&#146;t care anymore? Looking up to the afternoon sky I
    mutter a prayer to Tunare, &quot;Help us, Great Mother, help us&quot;. Looking around I
    see a suitable spot of soft earth near the base of a rocky outcropping from the mountains.
    Removing the small shovel from my pack I began to dig. Hours later when I had finally laid
    the bodies to rest in a grave covered with a stack of small rocks, I sat down against the
    mountain wall. Taking a long drink from my canteen, I wondered who these travelers were?
    Where might they have been heading and who will miss them? Inevitably these questions lead
    to the same about myself. Who would miss me if I were to be killed this day? While I sit
    pondering these questions, the sun is setting over the horizon, it would be suicide for me
    to try and travel through the forest at this time of night. Even with the relative safety
    of the camouflage spell there is a real risk. I can remember the last time I passed
    through these woods and my camouflage spell wore off while I was right in the middle, I
    barely made it out alive. While hideous undead creatures cast spells that sapped the life
    from me, all I could do was run and pray. Luckily I had made it, praise Tunare, however I
    had no intention of taking any unnecessary risks. As the darkness approached I moved back
    into the relative safety of the mountain pass leading to High Hold to make camp and wait
    for the first light of day. </font></td>
