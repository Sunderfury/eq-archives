    face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4"> I had not been prepared for this at all. The extreme
    cold, snow and ice everywhere, bitter wind gusts, this place made the Everfrost Peaks look
    like a vacation resort area. I had just arrived on the newfound continent of Velious and
    was already considering turning back. After thinking about it for a moment I decided to
    stay for at least a little while, the rumors of great treasure helping to make the
    decision for me. As I turned to watch the ship leaving port, breaking ice as it traveled
    through the Iceclad Ocean, I hoped I had made the right choice. I asked one of the gnome
    pirates that were hanging around the docks where I might find supplies, &quot;We ave a
    small camp up yonder,&quot; he replied, pointing inland. Pulling my cloak tightly around
    me to try and keep out the cold I headed in the direction he had pointed, leaving the
    relative dryness of the dock behind, for the deep snow that seemed to cover everything. As
    I trudged along through the snow, my thoughts turned inward as I tried to think warm
    thoughts. Suddenly, from the right, something lunged at me, leaping over my head and
    knocking me to the ground. I rolled, as best I could in the snow, and pulled my swords
    from my sides as I regained my footing and stood to face whatever it was that had attacked
    me. Directly ahead of me stood a pure white cougar, his sparkling black eyes stared at me
    as his tail flicked back and forth. &quot;I have no quarrel with you, my cat friend&quot;
    I yelled, but he only crouched low and lunged at me again. Blessed Tunare, but he was
    fast, I barely had time to fall back, lifting my leg and planting it in the large cats
    stomach as I threw him back over my head. The cat landed on its feet with hardly any
    effort, as I jumped back up to turn and face it again. This thing was powerful and very
    fast, and I could see that it wasn&#146;t going to leave without first having me for
    lunch. Quickly I spoke the magic that my Mother had taught me, and the great cat was
    slowed to half its normal speed. When it came at me again, my Yaks carved into its flesh
    with abandon, cutting deeply, severing flesh and bone alike. Soon the snow around us was
    stained red with blood and the great cat went down quickly under my attack. I stood
    looking down at it as it lay in the snow gasping for breath, this beautiful majestic
    creature, it hadn&#146;t needed to come to this, if only it had not attacked me.
    &quot;Well, my friend, you will serve to help keep me warm after your death&quot; I said,
    as I brought my sword down with the killing blow. Dragging the cougar&#146;s corpse with
    me, I found the small camp of the pirates not far down the coastline. I was able to barter
    with the pirates, trading the dead cat for some other skins and supplies. One of the
    pirates took a claw from the great beast and fashioned it into an earring, he said that
    the cats here had magical qualities and that sometimes Jewelry made from them could be
    worn to increase ones strength and power. I thanked him and put it on, immediately feeling
    an increase in my strength. What a wonderful place, I thought to myself, I had only been
    here a very short time and had already acquired some new magical equipment. As I stood
    there, warming myself by the big fire in the center of the camp, I wondered what other
    treasures awaited me in this vast frozen wasteland. What other adventures will I find out
    there as I travel this new land? The sun was falling quickly in the sky as it began to
    snow heavily, I guess I&#146;ll find out soon enough, I thought, as I moved closer to the
    fire, trying to thaw out somewhat before I started my journey.</font></td>
