    </big>One of the first little people that I have ever grouped with, Tindail proved to be
    quite a fighter. In addition to that I found him to be a great partner and
    conversationalist. We only fought together for a short time, but I consider him to be a
    friend and would be happy to group with him again. I believe he would be a strong addition
    to any group as both a fighter and companion. Stay well my small friend, and may the
    blessing of Tunare be upon you always.</font></big></td>
