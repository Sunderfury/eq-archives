    outside of a cutthroat camp. We joined forces to kill the cutthroats and then moved on to
    the Oasis for a short time before going our seperate ways. She is an excellent fighter and
    although she is a member of the dark race she didn't act evil and seemed to be
    compassionate and caring. I found her to be extremely attractive and very beautiful and I
    would ask Tunare, the Great Mother, to keep her safe and help her to stay a force of good
    in the world.</small></font></td>
