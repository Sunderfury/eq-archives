    Our recent guild meeting at Surefall Glade was pleasant as usual. I met with some of the
    new additions to the guild and I caught up on the travels and adventures of some of the
    brothers that I have not seen in a while. We discussed many matters of importance to the
    guild, and voiced concerns about various issues that have come up throughout the land. The
    guild itself grows stronger by the day and I can see that Tunare herself has given us Her
    blessing, I truly believe that soon we will be a force against evil like no other.<br>
    The Meeting was not all business however for one of the high points of my day was once
    again seeing the Lady Siniana, I truly believe she has become more beautiful than the last
    time I saw her. She has also become much more comfortable and confident within the guild
    itself as was demonstrated by the way she moved amongst us, chatting here, flirting there,
    a giggle, a laugh, an angel on Norrath. I found myself once again completely absorbed by
    her manner and beauty, yet somehow I managed to remain focused on the business at hand.
    After all the Lady Siniana is very young, mayhaps too young for an old ranger such as
    myself. Yet she advances in level quite fast and perhaps someday we might travel together,
    exploring the wonders of Norrath. When the meeting had ended and we were all saying our
    good-byes, Siniana graced me with a kiss, what a pleasant surprise, ah yes, twas quite
    sweet indeed. <br>
    After the meeting I had planned on travelling to the Rathe Mountains to battle some of the
    creatures there. I had scouted the area earlier in the week and found it to be infested
    with giant skeletons and hill giants among other things, and I had thought that a few of
    my brothers and myself might make our purses bulge with the coin from these giant
    skeletons. However it was not to be, Klymeth was unable to make the meeting and most
    everyone else was going into Surefall to replenish supplies. Brothers&#146; Haemish and
    Greogor were heading to the frozen wastelands of the North to locate a particular item
    needed to make Ivy Etched Bracers and I decided to go along with them. The trip to the
    Everfrost Mountains was quite short as we were able to get the Spirit of Wolf spell cast
    on us from brother Conwen before we left. The knolls of Blackburrow gave us no trouble at
    all as we passed through the caves leading North, and soon we emerged into the snow and
    ice that is Everfrost. As we wandered through the snow and cold searching for signs of a
    small orc tribe I kept my thoughts on the warmer climates of the plains in an effort to
    keep from freezing. Soon we picked up the trail for what we hunted, a small group of icy
    orcs led by an orc named Redwind. It was rumored that the leader of these orcs, the one
    named Redwind, carried the runes needed to make the Etched bracers. Now before us encamped
    in long forgotten ruins was this Redwind and another icy orc. We watched them for a little
    while to make sure there were no others, these two would be no trouble for us, however two
    more could present a problem as the icy orcs are much larger and stronger than any of the
    other orc clans. When we were satisfied that there were no others, we made ready to
    attack. The plan was for brother Greogor to move in a little closer and draw them out of
    the ruins into battle, then Haemish and I would attack from behind. We would all focus our
    attack on the leader Redwind as best we could, then turn on the other when Redwind fell.
    Redwind was a superior foe, but with my brothers Haemish and Greogor with me, who are both
    somewhat more experienced, I felt confident that we would be all right. Greogor moved in
    and began taunting them, they charged out of the ruins immediately and engaged him,
    stronger they might be but obviously not any smarter than their cousin orcs from the east.
    Haemish pulled back on his Trueshot bow and let loose an arrow which sunk deep into the
    leg of Redwind, he roared with pain just as he engaged Greogor. In a moment we were both
    on him from behind, slashing and hacking away. The creature was immense and quite strong,
    he fought ferociously and it seemed like forever before he finally fell. We turned to face
    the other orc who was in a fit of rage over his leader being killed. Alas no amount of
    rage could save him from his fate. The three of us made short work of him, and he fell
    with a scream. We had all been slightly hurt but thank Tunare nothing very serious at all.
    We quickly searched the bodies, finding the runes we had come for and a fair amount of
    gold coin.<br>
    In the distance I heard the roar of one of the giant mammoths that roam the wastes of the
    north, the afternoon was waning away and I wanted nothing more than to be gone from this
    cold place. Later that evening as we made our way through the hills of Qeynos I pulled the
    rune from my pack and considered it, was it worth a life to obtain such a rune? I do not
    know, I know only that Tunare wishes me to continue my battle against evil and I will do
    that as long as She requires it. As the darkness approached brother Haemish made camp in
    the hills and Greogor wanted to travel east as fast as possible on business, so we parted
    ways. After wishing them both well, I decided that I would head into Qeynos and see what
    the city had to offer this evening. Tis not often that I am near a city, and perhaps I
    might find some more adventure within its walls, perhaps purchase some equipment, perhaps
    more likely than not, find a lovely young woman to help remove the chill from my bones.</font></td>
