    <small>A glorious place, located in the Qeynos hills, it features beautiful forests, a
    lake and waterfall, both a Rangers Guild and a Druid guild, and shopkeepers who sell
    everything from fletching supplies to various spells. It is a quiet place where you can go
    and rest up from your travels, maybe do a little fishing and relax, or learn some new
    skills from your Guildmaster. I recommend Surefall Glade as a must visit for all
    adventurers. A warning to poachers, beware, the animals here are under the protection of
    the rangers and druids and anyone caught hunting animals will be punished swiftly and
    severely.</small></td>
