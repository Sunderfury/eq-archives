    Rathetear</strong><br>
    <small>The Northern entrance to Lake Rathetear is located at the Southern edge of the
    South Karanas Plains. It is a very dangerous place, during the day white knoll guards,
    captains and shamans patrol the area. At night dangerous undead creatures, such as dry
    bone skeletons and resurrected knolls can be found here. Elsewhere throughout the lake
    region you will find islands and coastal villages, each one inhabited by a different race
    of creatures including barbarians, bandits, goblins, gnolls, and others. to get to these
    islands and villages you should take one of the small boats from one of the many docks
    located throughout the area. Be careful while on the boat and don't fall off, I have heard
    many rumors about a giant monster that roams the lake looking for its next meal.</small></td>
