    As he walked through the wilderness, he knew something was terribly wrong. He awoke in a
    deserted shack yesterday, alone and tired, unable to remember much, but as he walked the
    memories came flooding back into his mind. He remembered who he was, &quot;Temyez
    D&#146;argos&quot; he thought to himself, images of all his friends and Guild mates,
    images of the woman that he had cared so much about, began filling his mind, threatening
    to drown him. Memories kept coming back, memories of the great Love he had for life and
    for a particular woman, but he just didn&#146;t seem to have that Love any more, as a
    matter of fact he didn&#146;t seem to care any more about anything, and this is what
    really bothered him. Every time a memory or an image flashed through his mind, he could
    clearly see what was happening, he could clearly see that there were feelings and emotions
    involved, but he felt nothing now, nothing at all. He remembered his father being killed
    by a giant, but felt nothing. He recalled how his mother had died in his arms, but his
    heart did not weep. He thought about Lady Siniana and all the many things that they had
    shared together, but his heart felt cold and dead. He stopped walking and stood there for
    a moment, unable to think, unable to feel. What was wrong with him? Why couldn&#146;t he
    feel anything? He couldn&#146;t remember why he was here, what had brought him to the New
    Lands of Kunark. Nor what had happened to him for the last few days. He walked over and
    sat down on a large rock. His head was starting to hurt and he was still tired. He pulled
    the small note out of his pocket and looked at it again. Who had written this? Why did
    they write it and leave? The more he thought about things the more questions he had, but
    that&#146;s all he had. There were no feelings at all, he wasn&#146;t angry, sad, or hurt,
    he didn&#146;t feel anything at all, just empty, like a huge hole had somehow been created
    inside of his body. He had been heading south, following the directions on the note, but
    why? He didn&#146;t know, he only had this drive in his mind to return home, yet he
    didn&#146;t know why. If he kept going he would ultimately end up back at the Guildhall
    amongst his friends, but he really didn&#146;t care about that right now. He didn&#146;t
    seem to care about anything at all. His head was really starting to hurt, pounding near
    his temples, as if someone was beating a giant drum inside of his head. He sat thinking
    about what to do, where should he go? He was feeling really alone, isolated, desolate
    almost, as if he had no one to share anything with. He thought he should probably stay
    here, it would be better than going back to the Guildhall, better than being with people
    he could remember but cared nothing about. The pounding in his head grew louder, harder,
    almost hurting him. He decided he would go to ground, so to speak, lose himself in the
    wilderness until he could figure this out. He stood up and the pounding in his head
    increased tenfold, his hands flew up to his temples as he cried out sharply. He tried to
    walk but fell down to his knees, holding his head in his hands. The images filled his
    head, his family, his friends, his Love, but no feelings whatsoever, only the pounding and
    the pain. The blackout came a moment later, he fell into unconsciousness quickly,
    releasing him from the pain, from the torment, for now.</font></big></td>
