    Desert of Ro<br>
    </strong><small>The Northern Desert of Ro, located South of Freeport and the East
    Commonlands is a vast wasteland of sand and sand dunes. It is home to dervish cutthroat
    camps and areas haunted with the undead, occasionally a sand giant will roam the southern
    half, be wary. It can be a dangerous place because it is easy to get lost in the dunes and
    with the hills you can be attacked by surprise very easily. There is a fishing village and
    an Inn to the North to buy and sell supplies. The tunnel to the commonlands is also
    located here in the Northwestern area. As always I would advise you to be careful in the
    Desert.</small></td>
