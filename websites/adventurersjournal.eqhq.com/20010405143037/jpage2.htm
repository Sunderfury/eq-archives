    Tonight I met a cleric named Klymeth, and his friend Valint. We spoke at length of forming
    a Guild dedicated to the followers of The Great Tunare. We have accepted each other as
    Guild brothers and will be searching the lands for honorable people to help us found the
    Guild - Holy Order of Tunare.</font></p>

    I traveled to the Estate of Unrest today, it is a very dangerous place. As soon as I
    crossed over into the area, I was rooted by a carrion ghoul and beat to death. only by the
    grace of Tunare was I able to return to Norrath and continue to fight evil. Unrest is a
    place filled with undead and creatures of the darkness, they roam the grounds around the
    house and there is no place that is safe from their unholy attacks. In addition to the
    roaming undead, there is the threat of the death beetles which will attack anything and
    everything usually in groups of two or more. The stench of death is constantly in the air
    as rotten zombies, ghouls, and partially decomposed undead stumble about the area, waiting
    to destroy the living. I speak only of the creatures that are in the yard, as during my
    stay here I was able to track even nastier creatures that lived in the house itself.
    Occasionally one of these more hideous things would be drawn out into the yard chasing
    some poor fool who had dared to enter the house. I could hardly bear to look upon some of
    these most hideous creatures and can only shudder to think of the horrors that lie deeper
    within.<br>
    My guild brother Klymeth joined me here and we fought together for a while, pulling
    zombies and skeletons to a somewhat isolated area where we could destroy them. However,
    sometimes we would get more than we bargained for when pulling one creature and two or
    three would show up. We destroyed many that day, but the unholy hoardes just kept coming.
    We left exhausted from battle and tiring of the stench that permeates everything.<br>
    Someday I will return here, perhaps to enter the house and explore the secrets that it may
    hold, but for now I will stay away from this eternally evil place.</font></td>
