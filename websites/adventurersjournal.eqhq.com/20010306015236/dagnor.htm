    </strong><small>Dagnor's Cauldron is located on the continent Faydwer, South of the
    Butcherblock Mountains. The Kedge Keep Dungeon is located within the lake here and the
    entrance to the Estate of Unrest is on the southern edge of the zone. This is a somewhat
    higher level zone that you should avoid until you are in your upper teens. The lake is the
    source for almost all creatures in this zone, with the execption of the Orc &amp; Goblin
    camps. There is a friendly NPC camp here, located just south of the entrance, that can be
    used as a safe haven if you get into trouble.</small></td>
