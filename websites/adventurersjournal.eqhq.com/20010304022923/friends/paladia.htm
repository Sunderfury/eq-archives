    <small>I met Paladia shortly after I started adventuring. We traveled together for a few
    days in the Western Plains of Karanas, the Hills of Qeynos and the City of Qeynos. She was
    a great travelling partner and I am honored to call her a friend. She has since gained
    much more experience than I and has moved on to new adventures in distant lands. I look
    forward to the day when we may travel together again. Until then she will be in my prayers
    as I ask Tunare, The Mother of all, to watch out for her and keep her safe from harm as
    she travels.</small></font></td>
