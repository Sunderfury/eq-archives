    </font><font size="3" face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#400040">&nbsp; I was born on the 8<sup>th</sup>
    day of June in the year 3155, in the Surefall Forest just north of the city of Qeynos. My
    mother, Etherael, a beautiful and proud elf enchantress and my father, Robert, a human
    knight raised me with a good mixture of love and discipline. We lived in the forest, apart
    from the city and my mother taught me the ways of the wood very well, in addition she was
    careful to teach me the ways of different cultures, races, and civilizations. She also
    taught me some magic, very little magic compared to what she knew, but enough to be useful
    in more than a few situations. Because she was an enchantress we had many books and I read
    a lot, these books gave me an insight into a world that I had never seen. A world of huge
    gleaming cities, of small villages and towns, of dark castles and dungeons, of mountains
    and plains, and of all the people and the many different creatures that inhabit them, both
    friendly and dangerous. My mother taught me many things and I loved her very much.</font><p><font

    I only knew my father for a few years, what I remember most about him was his size, he was
    huge, towering over me at close to seven feet tall. His massive arms fully the size of
    most adults legs, yet he could be as gentle as a soft summer breeze when he wanted to be.
    Robert was his name, he was a warrior, a human knight, and he taught me how to be a man. I
    remember him spending hours teaching me the ways of battle, much to the dismay of my
    mother, who would say that it was no use teaching me these things, since she would never
    let me become a warrior. She would often remind him during these training sessions how
    they had come to meet. How she had found him gravely wounded after a great battle. At
    first she had thought him dead, until she heard a small groan and whisper from him. She
    had knelt down beside him to check his wounds, (often my father would interrupt at this
    point in the story), &quot;Twas then my son, that I knew there were angels&quot;, his
    voice would boom, &quot;When I opened my eyes and saw the most beautiful creature that I
    had ever seen.&quot; My mother would quickly continue the story (with a huge smile and
    quite a blush on her cheeks) by saying in addition to the great wounds to his body, during
    the battle he must have received quite a blow to his head to have rattled his brains so
    much. She had taken him home that day and cared for his wounds and their love grew quickly
    and immensely. They were never apart from each other again, until my father died.</font></p>

    When I was nine years old we left the forest for a lunch outing and were moving through
    the foothills of the Qeynos Mountains when a wandering hill giant stumbled upon us, the
    giant immediately rushed us intending, I am quite sure, to kill us all. With blinding
    speed my father drew his weapon and was on him, it was over in minutes. The giant lay dead
    on the ground and my father lay beside him. During the battle the giant had scored a
    devastating blow to my father with his club. My mother worked over him for days, but in
    the end she could do nothing, except hold him while he slipped away. My father taught me
    how to fight, how to treat a woman, and how to be an honorable man, I loved him and I miss
    him to this day.</font></p>

    </font><font size="3" face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#400040">My mother wasn&#146;t quite
    the same after my father died, it was as though a piece of her had died also, she
    didn&#146;t smile as much and oftentimes she seemed very distant. Life was good for us,
    but for my mother the days just seemed to drag on, she tried not to let it show, but I
    could see it. A year ago she come down with Red Elm fever and slowly began to waste away,
    I held her as she died, as she had held my father. I know she was sad to leave her home
    and her son, but I believe she was happy to be going to be with my father again, at the
    very end she whispered his name, then she was gone.</font></p>

    I left my home on March 26<sup>th</sup> of the year 3172 to begin my adventure, to find
    fame and fortune, and hopefully, some of the happiness that my mother and father knew. </font></td>
