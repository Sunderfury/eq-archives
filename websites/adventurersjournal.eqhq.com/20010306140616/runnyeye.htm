    <small>Runnyeye, home to the runnyeye goblin tribe. It is a rather small area located in
    the mountain caverns between the Beholder Maze and the Misty Thicket. It's a good place to
    get some good experience, but be careful as it can also be a deadly experience. There are
    many goblins roaming the tunnels, warriors and casters alike, evil eyes also can be found
    here. It is a fairly high level area where some very good items can be found. You won't go
    far here unless you are level 10+ and have a decent party.</small></td>
