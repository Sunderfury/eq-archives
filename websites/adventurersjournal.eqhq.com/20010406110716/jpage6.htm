    I have reached level 20 and I immediately went to the local rangers guild. The ranger
    guild trainer told me that I have earned the honor and privilege of taking a Surname for
    myself, I will take the name of my father and his father before him, the name of D'argos.
    From this day forward I shall be known as Temyez D'argos, and I will do my best to bring
    glory and honor to the name, as did my forefathers.<br>
    <br>
    It was a beautiful sunny morning when I finally left the rangers&#146; guild in Kithicor
    Forest, after two days of training I was glad to be out of there. I had arrived here after
    a long, extended stay in the wilderness and although glad to be back in a town again I
    couldn&#146;t imagine staying here for any long period of time. Upon my arrival I had gone
    to see the trainer immediately, I felt that I had enough experience to learn the secret of
    the double attack and the trainer had agreed with me. We had spent the last two days
    training in this devastating new tactic and I felt good, refreshed, and ready to try out
    my new skills in battle. Before leaving I decided to stop in to the weapons and armor shop
    to see if they had anything new. I was looking over the various weapons when a guild
    trainer approached me and asked if I would be interested in earning a magical weapon.
    Always eager for a chance to get magical items of any kind, I told the trainer that I
    would be interested and asked him to tell me more about this magical weapon. He told me
    about the sword, what a weapon, the short sword of Morin, a one handed sword that was not
    only masterfully crafted, but also magically increased certain abilities of the wielder.
    This sword would fit perfectly into my arsenal, and I told the trainer that I would be
    willing to do almost anything for such a sword. The trainer began to tell me of the
    dangers that have crept into the forest, the undead creatures and shadowmen that have
    increased their presence on the outskirts of the woods. In order to defend the forest
    against these threats the rangers of the area needed information on the whereabouts and
    plans of these creatures. I was told of a messenger, a ghoul messenger that travels
    between the forest and an undead camp on the Karanas. This messenger carries the
    information that the rangers need, if I could intercept this messenger and relieve him of
    this information, then return it to the rangers of this camp, I would receive the sword as
    a reward. Excited about this opportunity, I told the trainer that I would find this
    messenger and return with the information he needed. I headed out of the ranger camp
    feeling uplifted and focused on obtaining this sword, looking west I lifted my head and
    said a silent prayer to The Great Mother, then began to move silently through the forest.
    My trip to the plains of the Karanas was uneventful and as I came down the ridge from High
    Pass Hold into the eastern edge of the plains I was once again in awe of the beauty of the
    place. The wide open expanses, the freshness of the air, the complete uninhibited view of
    the sky, of all the many places I have been the plains are by far my favorite, and not
    just because my home is so near, its just that I love the openness of it. As I entered the
    plains I began to search for signs of this ghoul messenger but found nothing, and decided
    that I would continue to head west searching for signs. As I moved west I began to see
    signs of creatures passing and when I arrived at the westernmost area of the plains I
    almost immediately picked up signs of the ghoul and began tracking him. I had been
    tracking him for some time when I finally spotted him far ahead just going over a ridge, I
    paused to cast a camouflage spell on myself so I could stay concealed, and picked up my
    pace so I could catch up with him. I got within about twenty feet and just followed him
    for a while, he had no idea that I was there and I watched him intently, looking for any
    signs of weakness, studying his movements. He was very fast, and he changed direction
    constantly, probably to keep from being followed easily. He looked very formidable and I
    was weighing my options, deciding if I was capable of defeating him, just as I was leaning
    towards not attacking him my camouflage spell wore off, and I became visible. The creature
    turned instantly and attacked me, I had been caught unprepared and took serious damage
    before I could even put up a defense. The creature flailed away at me with his fists and I
    knew almost immediately that I was in serious trouble. Here I was just minutes into the
    battle and I had been wounded badly and worse yet my blows did not seem to effect the
    beast at all. The ghoul cast a root spell on me and I found myself unable to retreat as it
    continued to beat on me, it seemed that I was doomed. Suddenly an arrow slammed into the
    creatures thigh, and it screamed in pain. Another ranger leapt into the battle and started
    hacking away at the backside of the beast. What luck I thought, possibly this other ranger
    would be able to draw the ghoul off of me, and I could retreat and heal, but as the battle
    continued it became obvious that was not to be. The ghoul could smell death and continued
    to beat on me until I fell, a defiant battle cry escaping with my last breath. Sometime
    later I awoke, cold and alone, in an isolated area in the mountains of High Pass Hold. The
    Great Mother Tunare, in Her infinite wisdom had restored me to life so that I may continue
    my battle against the evil of the land. I know not why She deemed me worthy to bring back
    from death, I do not question the decisions of The Goddess. I only know that I will thank
    Her endlessly for the gift of life and will continue to serve Her in whatever capacity
    that I can. I do not know the name of the other ranger who joined my battle with the
    ghoul, nor do I know the outcome of his battle, I pray he was victorious, but that is a
    matter between him and Tunare. Someday I will return to hunt this ghoul again, someday I
    will earn the sword that was promised to me, someday when I am stronger and wiser. For now
    I will mend my wounds, learn from my mistakes, and perhaps, just perhaps find some lovely
    woman to help ease my pain for a night or two.</font></td>
