    face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">I have left the Guild and I am alone. I was forced to
    leave behind the Guild that I had helped to create, forced to leave behind my friends, my
    family, everything that ever meant anything to me. Forced by my own feelings and desires
    for love, a desire that could never be fulfilled. I miss them all terribly, oh, we still
    talk occasionally, but it will never be the same and I feel as if I have no one now. </font><font
    size="6"></font><font size="4"><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Through it all I gained a
    true friend, Abruzi Trickiwik, who stood by me when I was in great pain and helped to
    comfort me. Recently though, she has gone too, she could no longer tolerate the wickedness
    of this world, and so, she gave herself to the wind and allowed her God to take her away
    forever. I was with her when she left, among a small gathering of her friends, and it was
    a very sad day. She kissed me softly on the cheek and handed me a rose, then she smiled at
    me and was gone. I howled to the stars and cried for hours, just one more heartache to add
    to the ones I already carry. I will carry the Rose she gave me until the day that I too,
    leave this world behind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Until then I travel on, looking for the fame, adventure,
    and love, that I began searching for so many years ago. When I was just a boy leaving his
    home. Praying that someday, Tunare will grant me all those things and more.</font></font></td>
