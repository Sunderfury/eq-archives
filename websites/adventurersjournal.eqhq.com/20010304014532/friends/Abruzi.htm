    <big>I met Abruzi during the troubles and trials prior to my leaving the Holy Order. We
    became fast friends and she quickly helped to hold me together when everything was falling
    apart around me. She comforted me when I needed comforting, she held me when I cried, she
    fought for me when I could not fight for myself, she helped me to &quot;Cowboy up&quot;
    when I was down, she reached out and touched my heart and it literally saved me. I truly
    don't even know what to say about her, words cannot even begin to say how I feel about
    her, she became my best friend, of that there is little doubt and I am truly honored to
    have known her.<br>
    Recently, I stood by her when she left this world and gave herself to the wind, and now
    she is always in my thoughts. Before she left, she lightly kissed my cheek as I cried, she
    then gave me a rose which I will carry with me, until I too, leave this world. I miss her
    terribly every single day, even while I thank Tunare for allowing me to get to know her. I
    hope she will always be happy wherever she may wander.</big></font></td>
