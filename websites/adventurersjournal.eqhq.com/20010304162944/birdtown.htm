    <small>Aviak village (bird people village) is located on the southern plains of the
    karanas, almost directly south of Splitpaw. The bird people showed no hostility towards
    me, however they wouldn't sell to me either, saying that they didn't like rangers much
    less half-elves. Perhaps they would be kinder to some other adventurers, if so they might
    turn out to be an valuable resource for food and water.</small></td>
