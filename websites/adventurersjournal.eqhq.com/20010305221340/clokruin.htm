    <small>The Clock Ruins of Ak-Anon, located in the South East of the continent Faydwer. The
    ruins are quite a sight to behold, giant gears and clock towers have become part of the
    landscape here. The area is infested with undead and other creatures. It is also located
    near the Minotaur Mines, so you should be careful when travelling in and around this area.</small></td>
