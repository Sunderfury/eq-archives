    During a recent outing with the guild in the Steamfont Mountains, Lady Siniana and I
    shared a few quiet moments together beneath a shady tree. I was showing the Lady some of
    my writings and she was showing me some of hers when a gust of wind blew many of our
    papers. Somehow one of Siniana's Papers got mixed with mine when we were collecting them,
    my heart leapt when I read it, the poetry was beautiful and I was left speechless. To know
    that she has feelings for the likes of me is beyond all of my hope. Still, I will not
    press her for I do not wish to damage anything we have. I thank Tunare for the blessing
    she bestows upon me and for bringing this lovely woman into my life. <br>
    The paper that I found is below, I have changed nothing, the words are hers;</font><p>&nbsp;</p>

    Tomorrow, the guild is going hunting in the Steamfont Mountains and my heart is racing at
    the thought of who will be there. Yes, the handsome Lord Temyez, oh how he makes my heart
    melt. I have had these words running through my mind all day. I wish I could just tell him
    how I feel. Well, maybe someday I can tell him all of this.... </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Lucida Sans">GREEN EYES </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Lucida Sans">In the lingering heat,<br>
    Starry suns circling Overhead,<br>
    your quiet Embrace left love <br>
    Dancing across my Rosy lips.<br>
    Your Callused and tender Fingers gripping my <br>
    Arms to fear I may Run away.<br>
    &quot;No,&quot; I Assure you, &quot;it Would be childish To flee.&quot; <br>
    I envision Myself drowning in <br>
    Your oceans of green,<br>
    But their color Wraps me in a Blanket of security. </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Lucida Sans">As my soft fingers trace <br>
    The hardness of your arms' Flesh,<br>
    I think of your Strength. <br>
    Moonlit walks Along a dark beach,<br>
    Hearing your heavy breath On my ear.<br>
    These arms, Ready to protect me from All harm.<br>
    The night grows Sweeter with tender touches <br>
    And promises blazing our Love to a brighter flame. </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Lucida Sans">Kisses drenched with honey <br>
    Rain wet my lips against Yours, <br>
    And our bodies press Closer, <br>
    Molding into a Single heart. <br>
    Your skin Searching mine <br>
    For love's Warmth against bitterness.<br>
    Strong jaw line, granite, Yet passionately contoured, <br>
    So that it may not injure My face with closeness. <br>
    Your oceans of green clearing My muddy brown skies. </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Lucida Sans">Tokens of love received in <br>
    Handfuls of wind tossed by <br>
    Your callused hand, <br>
    Rippling flesh reaching to <br>
    Hang onto mine. <br>
    Whispers Of love under umbrella suns <br>
    Smile to kindle the highest Of all burning flames. <br>
    I Love you so much, detailed Perfection, longing to be held. </font></big></p>
    <p><font face="Lucida Sans"><big>We beat through one red heart, <br>
    See through your oceans, <br>
    kiss My rosy lips. I am protected By your arms, you, by my warmth. <br>
    Fires crash through green, our Flesh binds as one. <br>
    I love you Caresses each heart as it is <br>
    Blown from mouthful promises. <br>
    Love together an eternal flower. <br>
    Hold me please, green eyes, for I love you so much.<br>
