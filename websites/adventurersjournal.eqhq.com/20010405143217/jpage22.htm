    face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">The rain poured down as if the sky itself had been cut
    open and all the water stored in the heavens was trying to escape to the land below. As
    the ranger walked he was soaked by it, his clothing and armor drenched him right to the
    skin, he didn&#146;t care, it helped hide the tears on his face. He had been searching for
    the Lady Siniana for days now, with no sign of her, the tears he cried were tears of
    sorrow and rage. He felt completely useless, unable to help his Love, but what could he
    do? She had failed to show up at a rendezvous in the Faydark and now there was no sign of
    her, no way to find out what had happened, where she had gone. It was certain that there
    had been foul play, he was sure of that, for she had not contacted him in the last few
    days and that was not normal. His feelings changed rapidly from deep burning anger to
    complete helplessness, and through it all the tears flowed, occasionally he would shout
    out to his God, alternating between pleas for help and cursing.<br>
    He was returning to his Guildhall now to see if perhaps there was some message from her,
    some word of where she may be. Perhaps someone at the hall had seen her recently and could
    shed some light on what was happening. It was all that was left to do, he had been
    searching for days and had found nothing, asking questions of the all the people he had
    seen, but no one had seen her, no one had seen anything, she had simply vanished.<br>
    Approaching the Guildhall the ranger notices a bard running out the front door and heading
    into the forest. &quot;Hold up there good bard&quot; he yells, trying to stop him. The
    bard turns towards the shout, and upon seeing the ranger, a look of panic spreads over his
    face. Quickly looking around the bard runs into the forest, away from the approaching
    ranger. The ranger looked puzzled only for a moment, then almost without thinking he
    begins tracking the bard, chasing him through the forest, all the time questioning his
    actions. &quot;Why would he run like that?&quot; &quot;What is he hiding?&quot; &quot;Does
    he know something?&quot; Many questions and images plagued the ranger as he chased the
    bard through the trees. As the ranger burst through a large growth of weeds, he could see
    the young bard just ahead, &quot;Stop&quot; he yelled, but the bard showed no sign of
    slowing. &quot;Ok, we will do this the hard way&quot;, thought the ranger. Just within
    reach, the ranger leaped and grabbed a hold of the bard just as the bard made a hard right
    turn. The ranger holding on to the back of the bards cloak was swung around and thrown
    into a mid sized tree, &quot;ooooffffhhhh&quot;, the air was forced out of his lungs as
    his ribs and chest were slammed into the ungiving tree. He let go of the bard and fell
    into a heap on the ground. The bard continued to tear off through the trees as the ranger
    looked up uneasily. &quot;Dammit&quot;, said the ranger and attempted to get up, just as
    he moved, deep sharp pains flashed up his left side. &quot;Ohhhhh&quot;, he cried out as
    he fell back down. He stayed there on the ground, in the mud, unmoving for more than a few
    minutes, unable to breathe very well. When he finally stood up it was very slowly and with
    much pain. The bard was long gone and there would be no tracking him now, not with this
    injury. His left side hurt and every time he breathed in, sharp pains shot up his side.
    &quot;Probably broke a rib or two&quot;, he thought, &quot;at the very least cracked
    one.&quot; He stood, hunched over, soaking wet and covered in mud trying to catch his
    breath, &quot;Damn, this is not a good time for this.&quot; Thoughts raced through his
    head as he tried to figure out what was going on, how did all this fit together? The pain
    brought him back to reality, and he started slowly making his way back to the Guildhall. <br>
    As he entered he could see that there was no one here, there were no sounds from the
    interior of the place. Weakly he calls out, &quot;Anyone here?&quot; There is no response
    from anyone. He notices a small open parcel on the table just under the large tree that
    grows up in the middle of the foyer. Slowly walking over to the table, his side protesting
    every step with pangs of deep pain, he is gripped by the smell of lilies and jasmine,
    &quot;My Love&quot;, he says. Grabbing the parchment that lays next to the parcel he reads
    the words of the Lady Siniana. &quot;Oh no M&#146;lady, NO!&quot; He is shocked at the
    words, the pain in his side becomes secondary as his mind plays over the words she has
    written. Stunned, he leans on the table for support and notices a small drop of blood on
    the table, off to the right of the parcel. His eyes slowly move upward as he looks for the
    source of the blood. On one of the branches he sees a note of some kind. Reaching up he
    grabs the note and opens it to read the words, written in blood;<br>
    <br>
    The one you call Siniana is such a strong spirit, I am sad to say she lost much blood
    whilst we tried to write this note. But what prettier ink than that of a paladin&#146;s
    blood? However, if you wish to find her, you must come to Kunark and seek her. She
    witnessed an event that she shouldn&#146;t have, and therefore, she must remain with us to
    ensure our secret is safe. She doesn't wear a mask, yet sometimes it seems that way. When
    you first look at her you could actually cry, as some people do. Everything about her is
    beautiful, but I can't tell you. You must find her yourself.<br>
    <br>
    The blood had run down the page and dripped on to the table. The ranger&#146;s face
    contorts with rage and pain as he grabs his side. Immediately turning and going out the
    door the ranger moves as quickly as he can, heading for the docks, heading for Kunark,
    where his Love was being held, being hurt. The rage danced in his head and almost covered
    up the pain from his side. &quot;Someone will pay dearly for this,&quot; he thought as he
    went, and the very next thought, &quot;Tunare, please protect her, please keep her
    safe.&quot;</font></td>
