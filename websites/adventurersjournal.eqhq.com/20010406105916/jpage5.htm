    I hunted for the first time today in Mistmoore, A dreadfully dark place located on the
    southern edge of the lesser faydwer. It is the home of an ancient vampire and an ancient
    cult of dark elves. I was invited by one of my guild brothers, Haemish, he asked me to
    join him and his sister Megiani, while they explored the area. I must tell you, we didn't
    do much exploring, we had to stay very near the entrance to the place just to have a
    chance at staying alive. Everything here was a higher level than I was (at 19),&nbsp; even
    the most lowly creature was stronger than me. Directly inside there is a slope down a
    small hill and then the area opens up to a larger region that contains a ledge and a small
    lake, a small canyon runs off the far right side that probably leads to the Castle itself,
    however it would have been suicide for us to go any farther than the lake area. We did
    however have plenty of battles, as there were plenty of dark elves and gargoyles for us to
    fight. We dished out a fair amount damage, but most battles were still up in the air, so
    we tried to fight near the entrance so we could make a quick getaway if need be. To be
    honest we had to retreat many times during the course of our stay, it is a very dangerous
    place to explore. I did have a fantastic stroke of luck while I was hunting there, we had
    killed a glyphed ghoul that was carrying the fabled Mistmoore Shield, and since the shield
    is so rare we decided to roll the dice to see who would get it. Well the dice were rolled
    and lo and behold I was the winner and got to keep the prize. The shield is a fantastic
    piece of armor that not only helps to protect you, but has many magical enhancements, it
    also has the image of a fanged skull on it, which makes it a very special looking piece of
    equipment. Although the shield is an excellent edition to ones armor, I chose not to use
    it as I duel wield two weapons, so I sold it to a warrior for a very large sum of
    platinum, which I plan to use to purchase some better armor for myself in the near future.
    As for hunting in Mistmoore, I don't know when I'll return, it is so dangerous, but I am
    sure that someday I will and when I do perhaps I will be much stronger and able to see the
    castle itself. Until then let me say that if you travel there be very careful and may
    Tunare protect you.</font></td>
