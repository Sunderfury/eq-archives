    <big>The huge ship barely swayed as it cut through the waves, leaving a giant wake in its
    path. Its massive sails filled with air from the wind, which drove it across the sea. On
    board, the many passengers went about their business as the ship rode the giant swells,
    slowly rising and then falling with each new wave. </big></font><p><big><font
    face="Tempus Sans ITC">A ranger sat alone in an isolated corner of the deck, unaware of
    anyone else around him. Staring off into the distance, he sat sharpening his sword,
    occasionally he would grimace from some unknown pain within. He looked haggard and
    exhausted, and while his sharpening stone slid down the edge of his blade, his eyes would
    slowly close, only to be snapped open again by him, forcing sleep away. As he sits against
    the rail, the waves gently rocking him, he is fighting a losing battle against exhaustion.
    The last couple of days have taken its toll and as the hours pass by, he slips closer to
    total collapse. Slowly the stone slides down the blade and this time at the end, instead
    of rising back up again, it falls out of his hand on to the deck. The ranger&#146;s eyes
    have closed and the battle against exhaustion had finally been lost, quickly he fell into
    a deep sleep.</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">The mist was all around him, swirling clouds of thick
    fog encompassing him, making it impossible to see and threatening to choke him, to
    strangle him. He didn&#146;t know where he was or how he had got here, he couldn&#146;t
    remember much about himself, or his past. He was searching for something in the fog, but
    couldn&#146;t remember what it was. Images flashed in the fog quickly and then vanished. A
    giant loomed in the fog and then disappeared, a scaled hand with razor sharp talons swung
    at him then vanished, faces appeared staring at him, some laughing, some crying, a
    thousand muttering voices filled the air speaking all at once, blood soaked bodies were
    everywhere, he swung around trying to escape but they were there in the fog all around
    him, he fell to his knees and cried out, &quot;No, No, Please Stop!&quot; In the blink of
    an eye it was all gone, the fog swirled around him as he knelt, his scream echoing back
    and forth. Out of the fog came a lovely face, a face he knew well, it was his Love, the
    face of Lady Siniana, her eyes more beautiful than a cloudless night sky, her skin as
    radiant as the sun reflected off the surface of the water. She was smiling and saying
    something, he could not hear her as she mouthed the words, her lovely lips moving like the
    petals of a rose in the wind. He stared at her completely lost in her eyes. Suddenly her
    calm was replaced by terror, the words becoming a scream, blood ran down her face in a
    gushing torrent. He screamed out, &quot;Nooooooooooo&quot; and fell prostrate on the
    ground, covering his face from the horrible image. Everything vanished, the face, the fog,
    everything, and he was left in complete darkness, alone and shivering. Slowly raising his
    head he knelt, staring out into the darkness unable to see anything, Blinding light
    flashes in front of him, instinctively he closes his eyes and lifts his hands and arms to
    shield himself from the light. The awesome power of the light burns through his hands and
    arms, turning them to ash, his eyelids melt away as he is forced to face the uncovered
    truth that the light offers. The pain is unbearable as the light burns into his very soul.
    His tears burned away before they have a chance to form as his eyes are scorched in their
    sockets. The light burns through him slowly, burning him up, turning him to ash.</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Suddenly he is on a warm beach, the sand is soft
    under his clenched fingers. Slowly lifting his head he sees the sun setting in the
    distance, the water laps at his knees sinking in the sand. A woman is floating in the air
    above the water a short distance from him, she is dressed in a white flowing gown trimmed
    in gold, and a soft white glow pulsates around her. She is staring at him but he cannot
    seem to quite make out her face, she is right there in front of him, but he can&#146;t
    seem to focus on her. &quot;The Answers you seek are within you&quot;, she says boldly in
    a voice that sounds like tinkling glass. The ranger looks around himself and then back at
    the floating woman &quot;What?&quot; he replies, not understanding. &quot;The answers you
    seek are within you&quot; she repeats. He looks down at his chest and then back up &quot;I
    don&#146;t understand&quot; he says to her, shaking his head. She floats above the water
    unmoving, seeming to stare at him, the light emanates from her, pulsing like a beating
    heart. The ranger tries to stand up and pain shoots up his left side, his hand grabs at
    his side and he falls back down onto his haunches crying out slightly. The woman floats
    uncaringly as he grits his teeth against the pain. &quot;Your heart is a prisoner&quot;
    she says, unblinking, unmoving. The ranger looks up at her &quot;What do you want?&quot;
    he says to her, &quot;what are you saying?&quot; The woman begins to float away slowly out
    over the water &quot;Your heart is a prisoner of the green&quot; She says as she moves
    away from him. &quot;Your heart is a prisoner of the green, find your heart&quot; she
    says, and then vanishes into a flash of light.</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">In an instant he is on his back, once again in the
    choking fog, he tries to sit up but scaled lizard hands come out of the fog and grab him,
    holding him down. The air is filled with laughter as the hands hold and scratch at him. A
    streak of pain flares in his side as he is hit, suddenly a knife cuts into his chest and
    the pain explodes across his body. He stares, eyes wide and unable to turn away as one of
    the hands reach into the bloody opening and pull out his heart. Blood spraying out and
    dripping all over his chest, the still pumping heart is thrown into and ancient green box
    and then locked. The laughter is louder now echoing through the air. The hands start
    shaking him and something is hitting him on the head,
    bam&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;..bam.</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">He opens his eyes as the boat sways and his head
    rolls and hits the rail,&#133;..bam. He grabs the rail and pulls himself up, still groggy
    from his sleep. The images of his dream still fresh in his mind. He cannot see anyone
    else, the ship appears to be empty, and night has fallen. Standing up he groans from the
    pain in his side and looks over the side. The ship is in port and docked, the lights and
    sounds from the settlement of Fironia Vie a short distance away reach his eyes and ears as
    he starts to walk across the deck, the visions of the dream still racing through his mind.
    When he was just young boy his mother had told him that visions are very powerful and
    should be heeded and understood. So he knew this was important somehow, but how? He needed
    to think on it, needed to understand it and that would take time, and time was a commodity
    that he had precious little of. For now, he had to get off this ship, he had to get into
    town and get some supplies, and he needed to find his Lady before it was too late. As he
    walked towards the docks, he picked up his pace and said a quiet prayer, &quot;Tunare,
    please help me.&quot;</font></big></td>
