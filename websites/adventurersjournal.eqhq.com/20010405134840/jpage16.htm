    </font><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="3">Stirred from my sleep from a noise nearby, I
    peer sleepily into the darkness, trying to determine if what I heard was real or perhaps
    just the stirrings of my dreamy mind. Out of the darkness and mist a figure appears moving
    slowly towards me. &quot;Who&#146;s there?&quot; I say, my hand moving towards my weapon,
    the figure does not respond but keeps moving towards me. There&#146;s something familiar
    about them; I can almost make them out. &quot;Who&#146;s there?&quot; I demand, standing
    up. &quot;It is only I Siniana, M&#146;lord&quot; emerging from the darkness, the Lady
    Siniana walks up to me slowly. &quot;M&#146;lady, how did you find me?&quot; I stutter,
    &quot;What are you&quot;, &quot;Shhhhhhhhh&quot;, Siniana says, &quot;no more talk&quot;
    she reaches out and touches my lips with the tip of her finger, her hand moving slowly to
    gently caress my cheek. Her eyes are locked on mine, she is beautiful, her hair is loose
    around her shoulders and the breeze blows it slightly. I had not noticed before but she is
    wearing no armor, only a lovely white gown that drapes loosely over her body. Reaching up
    she unbuttons the gown and lets it fall to the ground. She stands before me now, the
    moonlight reflecting off her pale skin, the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I take
    her in my arms as she accepts me in hers, her warmth flows through me, her scent envelopes
    me. Her breath is hot against my skin as she whispers in my ear &quot;Take me M&#146;lord,
    I am yours always.&quot; My hands roam the curves of her body as I kiss and lick her neck,
    my hands move lower, my lips lower. As I explore her body I can feel the heat building in
    my lower regions. She is lovely, everything that I had always dreamed. I close my eyes and
    inhale deeply, wanting to lose myself in her scent.<br>
    When I open my eyes I am staring up at the night sky, the moon is bright and the stars
    glow in the heavens. I am holding a recent letter from Siniana in my hands. The dream is
    still vivid in my mind as I lay there, wanting nothing more than to return to it, and
    Siniana. I recall my mother telling me, when I was a boy, that sometimes dreams are
    visions of things to come, I pray that she was right. Holding the letter up to my face I
    inhale deeply, the scent of the Lady Siniana fills my head as I close my eyes and try to
    return to sleep.</font></td>
