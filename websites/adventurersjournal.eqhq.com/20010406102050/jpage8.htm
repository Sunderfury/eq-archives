    <font face="Tempus Sans ITC">I had spent many days now on the East Coast searching for new
    armor. I had heard of something called a Bloodstained Tunic from a passing traveler long
    ago and desired one for myself. The traveler had told me that they were somewhat rare, how
    rare I had only begun to understand. I had attended every bazaar held here for the last
    two weeks and found nothing. This would be the last one for a while, as I had to travel
    back to Surefall for an upcoming guild meeting. Approaching the East Commons tunnel I
    could see the people gathered and hear the shouts of items for sale. Merchants and
    adventurers alike gather here weekly on Saturday to sell their wares or try to purchase a
    particular item. Many different classes and vocations could be found here and because it
    is so far from any city, races from all over Norrath, ogres, trolls, and even dark elves
    often can be seen here buying and selling. I have seen many different things here, from
    rare weapons to the teaching of many different languages you can most likely find it at
    the bazaar. I entered the tunnel and began to slowly walk past the rows of merchandise,
    some of the regular vendors had come to know me over the last two weeks and would shake
    their heads as I approached to signal that they had not seen the item that I was seeking.
    As I walked I noticed in the distance a huge ogre striding up the center of the tunnel.
    The crowds were clearing allowing him a path to walk through, I know not whether it was
    because of his girth or his stench, yet they cleared nonetheless. Vendors were pointing in
    my direction and the ogre started to move directly towards me, I locked eyes with the
    creature trying to figure his intent but could not. I tensed up, preparing myself for
    anything, my hand resting firmly on my sword hilt, although I doubt that I could have done
    a thing except retreat had the creature decided to attack, he was so huge. The ogre
    approached and with him a terrible stench, he raised his hand, &quot;Me no bash&quot;, he
    said &quot;Me ave armer&quot; and he pulled a red tinted chainmail tunic out of his pack.
    He held up The Bloodstained Tunic, now I see how it got its name, the tunic glowed an
    eerie shade of reddish brown, you could easily see that it pulsed with magic. &quot;Yu
    want wittle armer, dis too wittle fer Grokk&quot;, and he threw it right into my chest. As
    soon as it hit me I could feel the magic flow through my body, yes, this was exactly what
    I had been searching for. Grokk said, &quot;How muche shinies yu give Grokk fer da wittle
    armer?&quot; I presumed he wanted to know how much money I would pay for such a tunic, I
    could hardly understand him. &quot;I will give you 260 shinies, errr, platinum for the
    tunic&quot; I said. &quot;Yu ave oter stuff tu trade wif Grokk wif shinies fer da wittle
    armer?&quot; &quot;No&quot; I replied, &quot;I&#146;ll tell you what, I&#146;ll give you
    280 platinum for the tunic.&quot; The creature looked up a little and you could almost see
    the smoke coming out of his ears as he tried to think. &quot;Dat lot uf shinies, Grokk
    take&quot;, and he held out his huge hand. I pulled out my purse and began counting
    platinum pieces into his palm, breathing shallowly lest I take a deep breath and knock
    myself unconscious with the stink. When I had finished counting he turned and walked away
    without another word, &quot;Thank you&quot;, I yelled after him, receiving no reply.<br>
    I wanted to put the new Tunic on right away but it stank almost as bad as the ogre did, so
    I left the Bazaar and went out to the small lake in the commons to let it soak for a
    while. After I had washed it thoroughly it gleamed even more than it had previously and
    when I put it on it fit like a glove. A perfect enhancement to my armor, Tunare had truly
    blessed me today, this was a good buy indeed.</font></td>
