    The Love of my life! She is everything to me, my Love, my Life, my Soulmate. I first met
    her in Surefall Glade when she swore her allegiance to The Holy Order of Tunare. The very
    first time I saw her I knew something was special about her, I believe that I fell in Love
    with her at that very moment. From then on my heart belonged to her, I was unable to look
    at any other woman in the same way.<br>
    Since then our Love has grown strong and everyday it seems to get even stronger. I would
    gladly do whatever she asked of me, even if that meant laying down my weapons and giving
    up my travels forever. To be with her I would give all I posess and then some. I Love her
    completely and unconditionally.<br>
    She is a strong woman, self reliant, and very proud. She is able to take care of herself
    and knows the ways of battle well. She has a compassion and Love for others that I am
    constantly amazed at, freely giving of her time and/or belongings to help another person.
    She has an internal beauty that is matched only by her physical appearance. She is truly
    the definition of beautiful to me.<br>
    Everyday I thank Tunare for bringing us together and ask for Her blessing upon our Love.</font><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Recently, The Lady and I have been seperated from each other. I
