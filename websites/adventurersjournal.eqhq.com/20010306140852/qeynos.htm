    <small>Qeynos, a wonderful city, you can meet many different people here and there are
    many quests waiting for the curious adventurer. You can find just about anything you need
    inside the city, from food and supplies, to weapons and armor. The city offers many
    taverns and inns, an arena for battles and duels, and the docks where you can catch a boat
    to another continent. If you are a friendly person and good race you have nothing to fear
    here. However if you are an evil race you will be killed on site by the guards, it may be
    better for you to stick to the underground of the Qeynos sewer system.</small></td>
