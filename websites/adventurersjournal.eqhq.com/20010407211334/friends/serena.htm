    </big>I met Serena on the western plains and we shared a wonderful day of hunting and
    exploration. She was new to the area and was fascinated by everything she saw. I showed
    her as much of the plains as she wanted to see and I was inspired by her excitement and
    curiosity. I have not seen her since that day although I hope to meet up with her again.
    She seemed to have a good heart, and I pray to Tunare that she is able to maintain the
    level of excitement and curiosity she had on the day that I met her, and share it with
    everyone she meets.</font></big></td>
