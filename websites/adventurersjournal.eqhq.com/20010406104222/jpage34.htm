    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">The corn barely swayed in the breeze, each stalk
    straight and rigid like a foot soldier standing at attention in some great army. The
    rustling of the coarse, dry leaves seeming to speak some ancient lost language that had
    long since been forgotten. The silent call of the corn, beckoning to travelers and
    adventurers alike, &quot;Come and explore! See what may be hidden inside our shadowy
    rows.&quot; The children Especially, they were always fascinated by the cornfields,
    spending hours on end, running through the endless rows, playing hide and seek, enjoying
    the fact that you could literally disappear only a few steps in.</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">He liked it that way, it provided him with the
    opportunity to feed often, and of course it worked to his advantage being able to hide in
    the fields, not that it mattered much. During this time of year he was at his most
    powerful, almost unstoppable. He preferred however, to remain hidden and unknown, only a
    terrifying story to be told around a campfire late at night. He had haunted the corn for
    many, many years now and had been known by many different names throughout the centuries.
    Keargis the keeper, or Blearkin the Soul Eater, only the oldest of the local villagers
    knew him as Sorjonek, the faceless one, just an old superstition. </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">He smiled as he moved silently through the rows, his
    eyes glowing a furious red, deep-set in the hollow black pits of his empty sockets, his
    black teeth hidden from view in the deep recess of his mouth. He was in his most common
    form now, the living scarecrow, a being of the very cornfield he now walked through, made
    from the stalks and leaves of the corn itself. He made no noise whatsoever as he moved,
    almost as if his very will was preventing the dried leaves, sticks, and straw that made up
    his body from making even the tiniest sound. The stench that accompanied him was horrible,
    rotten dead flesh and blood staining the ragged clothes that hung from his straw and leaf
    stuffed body. Maggots and worms crawled through the blood soaked stuffing and dropped off
    as he walked, countless flies swarmed about him, creating a dark cloud that seemed to
    envelope him. Not that he cared, this was only a vehicle to him, a tool to be used for
    moving about, feeding, and killing, the smile growing ever wider on his bloody, mud-caked
    face.</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">He broke through the corn into a small clearing and
    walked to the ancient wooden post that stood in the center. Kneeling down he surveyed the
    area, this was his home, if any place on this world could even be called that. The corn
    nearby had been broken and trampled down to create the small clearing in the center of
    this vast cornfield. Old bones stuck up out of the ground like the broken corn stalks that
    surrounded them, with smaller piles of bones and skulls strewn about the entire area. The
    decaying remains of a few bodies also littered the clearing, some human some animal,
    unrecognizable, torn apart and half eaten, blackened from rot and decomposition. The crows
    sat almost ignoring him picking at the rotting corpses, they were used to his coming and
    going and gave him little notice. It was the ultimate irony that he could strike terror
    into the hearts of men and animals alike, yet couldn&#146;t frighten the very crows that
    the body he now inhabited was designed to scare. One very large crow approached him and
    pecked at some of the loose flesh that hung from his clothes. He grabbed at it with his
    straw covered claw, squeezing it tightly the bird squawked loudly before he shoved its
    head into his open mouth and bit down, biting its head completely off, he squeezed even
    harder as he pulled it away from his mouth, blood and guts sprayed out and onto his face,
    dripping down onto the ground. He smiled when he felt the warmth of the bird&#146;s blood
    on his face. Throwing he rest of the bird&#146;s body across the clearing his smile
    vanished quickly as he realized he would have to sleep soon. The Solstice had passed and
    the corn was starting to die off, before long he would have to rest until next spring. He
    frowned and reached down to tear off a piece of the rotting corpse nearest him and began
    to eat. Could it almost be that time again so soon, he was still so very hungry, it almost
    seemed as if he hadn&#146;t fed at all this season. As he chewed the putrid meat he
    thought back to earlier this evening when he had missed a chance to feed. The emptiness in
    his gut instantly replaced with the anger as it grew inside of him, the fiery glow of his
    eyes intensifying.</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">The young girl child had been so close, so very close
    to the corn. Just another few moments and she would have been his. He watched her as she
    walked slowly towards the rows, mesmerized by his little spell, calling her to him. Then,
    from out of nowhere, an adventuring ranger had called out to her, &quot;Hi Ho, little
    lady!&quot; She had ignored him and continued to shuffle towards the corn as if she had
    heard nothing. He too, had ignored the outburst, continuing to concentrate on the little
    girl, continuing to will her into the cornfield. The ranger had approached her then, and
    called to her once again, &quot; I say young Lady, might you tell a weary traveler where
    your village is?&quot; She had stopped then staring at the ranger with a somewhat
    bewildered look on her face. The faceless one had clenched his straw hands into fists,
    &quot;No&quot; he had thought, &quot;Don&#146;t stop.&quot; But, it was too late, the
    spell had been broken. The little girl had looked up at the ranger with a puzzled stare,
    &quot;What&#146;s that sir?&quot; she had said, her eyes blinking as if waking from a
    dream. The Ranger had begun talking to her then, &quot;My name is Temyez D&#146;argos, an
    outrider of Tunare, and I am looking for a place to rest for &#133;&#133;.&quot; </font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">The faceless one sat in the corn staring out at the
    two of them. He could no longer hear the words they spoke as the anger rose inside of him.
    His only thoughts were on the two of them. He could have taken them right there. Oh, the
    ranger would have put up a good fight he was certain, but in the end not much could stand
    against him right now. He had almost done it, but to take two people from out in the open
    like that was risky. He may have been seen, and it was just getting too late in the season
    to risk that. It might bring the wrath of the villagers down on him, they might burn the
    cornfield or some such nonsense, not that it would hurt him in the least, but then he
    would have to move on to another area and that was such a pain. This was his home after
    all.</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">He had watched as they walked away, the girl turning
    once to look back at the corn. He could almost taste her delicate flesh, almost feel the
    warmth of her blood spraying on him. He turned and crept silently back into the depths of
    the cornfield. Another day, another time perhaps, she had been marked by the call of the
    corn and would never forget. She would be back.</font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">&quot;Well&quot;, he thought, as he sat in his
    clearing pulling rotten meat off a corpse and eating. He could wait for another
    opportunity, the corn would give him that, it always did.</font></big></td>
