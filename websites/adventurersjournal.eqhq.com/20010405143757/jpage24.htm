    Walking around Fironia Vie was like walking around in a full sized city. It was hard to
    believe that the outpost had only recently been established. There were shops everywhere,
    where all manner of goods could be purchased or sold. Many people traveled through here on
    their way to the new lands of Kunark. It was here, in the wilderness of these new lands of
    Kunark , where Temyez thought he may find his Love, the Lady Siniana. She had been
    abducted in the days past by some unknown assailants and brought here, or at least that
    was what he had been told.</font><p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">He pulled the tattered
    letter from his pocket and read it again for millionth time,</font></font><font SIZE="2"></p>
    <i><p></font><font size="4">The one you call Siniana is such a strong spirit, I am sad to
    say she lost much blood whilst we tried to write this note. But what prettier ink than
    that of a paladin&#146;s blood? However, if you wish to find her, you must come to Kunark
    and seek her. She witnessed an event that she shouldn&#146;t have, and therefore, she must
    remain with us to ensure our secret is safe. She doesn't wear a mask, yet sometimes it
    seems that way. When you first look at her you could actually cry, as some people do.
    Everything about her is beautiful, but I can't tell you. You must find her yourself.</font></i><font
    SIZE="2"><br>
    </p>
    <p></font><font size="4"><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Someone, who claimed to have
    Siniana, left this letter at the Guild house, why they left it was unknown. The letter
    itself seemed to answer the question of why she was taken, but it left many questions
    unanswered. If she had witnessed something she should not have seen, and they wished to
    cover it up, why would they leave a letter telling where she might be found? If they
    wished for someone to come looking for her, what then were there intentions toward her?
    These and other questions had been plaguing the ranger since he had first boarded the ship
    in the Butcherblock Mountains. And since he had arrived here in Kunark he had been going
    from place to place asking questions, trying to find someone who might have the answers,
    someone who may have seen the Lady, or know who wrote this letter. The answers to his
    questions had all been the same, &quot;No, haven&#146;t seen her&quot; or &quot;Sorry,
    can&#146;t help you.&quot; All during this searching he is tormented by the vision that he
    had during his passage here. What did it mean this vision? The woman from the vision had
    said that the answers he seeks are within. What did that mean? He sure didn&#146;t feel
    like he had any answers. She had also said that his heart was a prisoner? He didn&#146;t
    know what that meant either; his heart didn&#146;t feel like it was a prisoner. Hurt, yes.
    Upset that he could not find Siniana, sure. But a prisoner? No he didn&#146;t think so. He
    was certain that this vision had something to do with what was happening lately, but he
    didn&#146;t know how, and it seemed that he wasn&#146;t getting any answers anywhere.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tempus Sans ITC">Stepping through a doorway, he finds himself at a tavern
    he has been to many times in the last couple of days. &quot;Well&quot; he thought,
    &quot;There are no answers here in Fironia, so I will head out soon, to search the lands
    as best I can&quot; He decided that would be the best course of action considering that he
    wasn&#146;t getting anywhere here. Walking up to the bar he asks the bartender for some
    water to fill his canteens. The bartender takes the canteens and, grumbling something
    under his breath, walks to the back to fill them up. While he is waiting for the water he
    looks around at the other inhabitants of the barroom. At the end of the counter a bar
    wench smiles at him and winks, he turns away in disgust. A couple sits quietly at a table
    out in the middle of the room eating lunch. The only other occupants are two old timers
    sitting just a seat over at the bar. The two old men are talking and he vaguely overhears
    some of what they are saying. &quot;&#133;&#133;&#133; treats me so bad I don&#146;t know
    why I stay wit her&quot; says one of them. &quot;Well now, don&#146;t git yerself all in
    an uproar Teddy&quot; replies the other, &quot;No, no, I&#146;m sik of it, I&#146;m not
    goin back there for a few days, I&#146;m gonna let her see what she&#146;s missin&quot;
    says the first one. The second man sits back and takes a swig of his ale, then he says,
    &quot;So then, where will ya be goin to?&quot; The first man looks up and scratches his
    beard, &quot;well, I think I&#146;ll head up and do some huntin out nere the green.&quot;
    The second one looks at him, &quot;Ayuh, is that right?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; replies the
    first man, &quot;Spend a few days hunting out there on the green&quot; Temyez loses track
    of the conversation as he feels a tap on the shoulder, &quot;Here&#146;s your water&quot;
    says the bartender with a frown. turning to take the water, he hands the bartender a few
    silver pieces &quot;Thank you&quot; He says. The bartender nods his head and walks away.
    Heading out the door he smiles about the two old men talking about woman troubles. He
    couldn&#146;t understand why some people get so upset, I mean he was looking forward to
    spending his later years with Lady Siniana. Perhaps settling down and getting a little
    farm somewhere, stop all this adventuring and just be together with her and nothing else.
    And here was this old man all upset with his woman and talking about leaving her for a
    hunting trip out on the green. Suddenly, he stopped in his tracks and the world seems to
    slow down. For a moment he is transported back to a vision that he had just the other day,
    the floating woman in his vision had said &quot;Your heart is a prisoner&quot;, &quot;Your
    heart is a prisoner of the green, find your heart.&quot; A prisoner of the green? He
    hadn&#146;t known what that meant, now these two old men had used the same term, &quot;The
    Green.&quot; Turning around he ran back inside the tavern, and up to the two old men
    sitting at the bar. &quot;Excuse me&quot;, he half shouted to them, &quot;Pardon me, I
    don&#146;t mean to interrupt, but what was that you said a few minutes ago about going
    hunting?&quot; The two men looked at him strangely for a moment, then the one spoke up,
    &quot;Well, I believe I said I was agonna go on a huntin trip up near the green.&quot;
    &quot;Yes&quot; Temyez cried out smiling, &quot;Yes, that&#146;s it, the green,
    that&#146;s what you said.&quot; &quot;Ayup, that&#146;s what I said&quot; the old man
    replied with a slight frown. &quot;Yes&quot; Temyez cried out again, &quot;I mean,
    I&#146;m sorry, what is the green? Where is it? Is it a place? Is it on a map?&quot;
    &quot;Hold up ther, sonny&quot; said the old man, &quot;The green aint on any map,
    it&#146;s a place that we old timers refer to, sumbody done gone and give it a fancy name
    now, but to us it will always be the green, but I kin show you on a map where itis,
    If&#146;n, you like?&quot; Reaching into his pack Temyez produces a map of Kunark and
    unrolls it onto the table. The old man looks at him kind of funny, &quot;Yer kinda uppity
    aint you sonny?&quot; Temyez looks at him and smiles &quot;Sorry about that&quot; the old
    man looks at him for a moment longer then points to a spot on the map with his finger,
    &quot;Here itis&quot; he says matter of factly. The next few minutes the old man tells him
    about the area and traces it with his finger, pointing out different features of the land
    and such. He tells him about the many old ruins that are located out there and the rumors
    that there are Ilksar in the area. Temyez thanks the men wholeheartedly and runs out of
    the place. Running towards the bridge to the mainland. When he reaches the bridge he pulls
    out the map and holds it up to take a look at it. The area that the old man had traced
    with his finger is quite large, but it gives him an idea of where to start looking.
    &quot;I am coming M&#146;lady, I am coming.&quot; He says with a grimace, then starts
    across the bridge, heading into the wilderness.</font></font></td>
