    <small>A Bandit Camp, a very dangerous place, usually full of bandits, sometimes high
    level spell casters and brigands. Wondering where they all are? A hunting party that I was
    with wiped them all out on this particular day, luckily none of us were hurt or killed,
    sometimes it doesn't go that well. Bandits can be a good source of bronze weapons and
    gold, although they don't like to part with them. Be careful around bandits!</small></td>
