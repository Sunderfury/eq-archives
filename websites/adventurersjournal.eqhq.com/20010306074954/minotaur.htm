    </strong><small>The Minotaur Caves are located in an Eastern region of Faydwer known as
    the Steamfont Mountains. The caves are the home to the Minotaurs, a race of half man, half
    bull creatures, and is one of the few places where you will encounter them. The Minotaurs
    are highly aggressive and will attack most adventurers on sight. They are fairly high in
    level, 15 to 20, and can put up quite a fight. I have also heard of a higher level monster
    known as the Minotaur Hero who occasionally shows up here and goes on a rampage killing
    everyone he encounters, unless of course you are able to kill him. Beware in the area of
    the Minotaurs</small></td>
