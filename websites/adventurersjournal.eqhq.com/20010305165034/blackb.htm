    <small>Blackburrow dungeon located in the Qeynos hills is a dangerous place for those who
    are not prepared. Home to the gnolls, they are aggressive and will usually attack anyone
    near. Almost always there is a large amount of people here, so a careful adventurer level
    5 or above should be allright if they stick to the upper levels. However be wary, there
    are traps and pits that will drop you down to the lower levels and it is easy to fall prey
    to one of the many trains that are pulled up from the depths.</small></td>
