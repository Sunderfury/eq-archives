      <P><B>Thifling Focusers</B>:Have 1 million HPs, hit for max 200, and
      are level 65. They are statics in the room
      with the prince. Prince is an very easy mob,
      no AE's, not very MR, with some nice drops.
      You can pull prince w/ out Focusers with
      non KOS druids/rangers casting harmony, and
      a high level monk puller to pull Prince.
      Best pull spot is to the waterfall. Getting
      any closer and you risk aggroing Ail the
      Elder. You'll need to clear to Tunare tree
      and clear the treants around there before
      you can do this.<BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Named Treants: There are 4. Ail the Elder,
      Fayl Eversong, Treah, Rumbleroot<BR>
      </B>All of these mobs have roughly 250k hps.
      Fayl and Treah do not have AEs. Treah has
      ALOT more ac then Fayl and takes alot longer
      to kill. Treah summons all Sylvan protectors
      when aggroed, so you need to clear all of
      these first. She can be slowed. Fayl has
      alot less AC and dies faster, but cannot
      be slowed. Fayl will summon all of the Entolling
      Cullers, possibly all of the entolling type
      of mobs. <BR>
      NOTE: If you do not kill these mobs fast
      enough, they will summon more of their type
      of mobs, even if none are up in the zone.
      These summoned mobs will then de-pop when
      treah/fayl is deaggroed (when you raid group
      dies ;p ) <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Ail the Elder/Rumbleroot<BR>
      </B>Stay away from these two for the most part.
      They are like Treah/Fayl but they have an
      AE that does roughly 400pts and they also
      cast AE silence, and this radius is HUGE.
      Its far far greater than casting distance.
      Silence means you cannot proc/cast spells,
      this can be dispelled though. Ail summons
      Ferals in the zone (the flowers) not sure
      of Rumbleroot yet. At 59, bards get a cha
      song that cancels Silence, however, unless
      they resist silence, they cannot sing it.
      Typical strategy group your clerics and bards
      together and pray the bards resist. You'll
      need good mr, and possibly cha for the resist,
      but i'm more inclined to beleive its MR based
      and level based. <BR>
      <BR>
      Best strategy for all the trees in general.
      Have your highest level tank stand immediately
      next to the tree and taunt/aggro. All other
      melees should be at MAX melee range. This
      range for the trees is HUGE, so they can
      be back a fair distance. Have all clerics
      watch the main tank. Have one keep him HoT
      (heal over time) and have 2 other clerics
      alternate CH/Divine light as needed. Main
      tank will take 95% of the damage. All trees
      always drop a random BP. <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Treants/Sirene Spirits/Tunarian Earthmelder
      all gate<BR>
      </B>If they gate, camp! They gate to there spawn
      point and summon you. For the treants
      this
      is the Tunare tree and this is bad.
      If you
      get summoned there hit the ground running
      to get away from those see invis mobs.
      Have
      your enchanters seive these mobs during
      the
      fight. Its possible to get them oom
      before
      they die if you have enough enchs.
      2 can
      do it, 3 is idea. If you have a small
      group,
      one can do it, as you have the time
      to seive
      before they gate to seive and allow
      the mob
      to cast itself oom. When these mobs
      get to
      30% life have all your group NUKE.
      Trick
      is to get them so low so fast that
      they start
      to run, rather then gate. OR, if they
      are
      gating, to kill them before they get
      a gate
      off. Having all tanks at one side,
      and all
      rogues on opposite side, will help
      to push
      the mob backwards, which helps to interupt.
      <BR>
      <BR>
      Hope this has been of some help. ALSO, as
      to the post of having 4 groups zone in and
      kill randomly and pray for PoGs, this is
      not a good way to break PoG at all. If you
      are gonna do this, keep all your group together,
      as you'll have multiple mobs aggro at times.
      Everything near the zone in can be mezze
      <BR>
      <BR>
      EXCEPT: Farstride Unicorns, the Whorling
      thing at zone and the PoGs when they come.
      The mob at zone in randomly sees invis. Test
      this w/ an unKOS person before zoning in.
      If it does see invis, be prepared to kill
      it. <BR>
      <BR>
      When PoGs respawn, have your druids
      run to
      intercept them and kite them till your
      group
      is ready to kill. <BR>

      Good pull spots: Ledge west of zone
      in. Clear
      to here first. Next, move north. Go
      back
      around the behind the zone in pillars,
      and
      follow the wall, keeping it on your
      left.
      Follow the wall to the waterfall and
      pull
      to here. Waterfall might create lag
      for your
      members so move a bit away from it
      if needed.
      If you pass the river, you enter Ail's
      roaming
      area, so be careful. Here is where
      you'll
      want to pull alot of mobs to, including
      from
      the Tunare tree. After you are done
      here,
      follow the river to the mouth of the
      lake.
      Pull to here till clear. This is a
      good spot
      to pull Treah to. Next, move around
      the lake
      a little bit. (As you face the lake,
      turn
      left, and move, keeping the lake on
      your
      right a bit.) To here you can pull
      Thiflings/Ordro/Serene
      Spririts. <BR>
      <BR>
      That should get you started. There are rougly
      450 mobs in PoG. It_is_huge. You really cannot
      clear the zone in one sitting unless you
      go 24 hours straight with a rather large
      size group. (24 people or so to clear before
      respawn) <B>Common mobs are on a 24 hours respawn</B>, and named mobs are alot more, and more
      random. Best time for loot is after a patch
      when you can get the easy named mobs which
      always drop gear. PoG drop rates been nerfed
      heavily, and its easy to get very little
      loot on a very long raid. Basically, you
      have to exp here to get loot. Happy hunting.</P>
