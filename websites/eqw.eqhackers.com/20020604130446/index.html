EQW is freeware and may not be sold in any way.  If you paid anything for this
program you have been the victim of a scam and should report it as such.  Use
this program at your own risk.  The author assumes no responsibility for damages
resulting from the use or misuse of this program.<br><br>

EQW is a program that allows you to play EQ in a window rather than fullscreen.
This not only gives you access to other programs while playing EQ but allows
you to run multiple copies of EQ at the same time.  See readme.txt for more info.<br><br>

If you have a problem with EQW I probably know about it.  Haven't had much time to work on it lately.
Email subjuct must include eqw or I won't get it.  No spam about fixing stuff.<br><br>

Might have some EQW message boards setup soon.  For now the gracious folks down at
<a href="http://www.hackersquest.org">hackersquest</a> have setup a <a href="http://www.hackersquest.org/boards/index.php">forum</a>
for EQW related information, mostly technical tips.<br><br>

Have resisted putting up a donation thing for awhile <a href="http://www.redcross.org/donate/donate.html">~</a>.<br><br>
