EQW is freeware and may not be sold in any way.  If you paid anything for this
program you have been the victim of a scam and should report it as such.  Use
this program at your own risk.  The author assumes no responsibility for damages
resulting from the use or misuse of this program.<br><br>

EQW is a program that allows you to play EQ in a window rather than fullscreen.
This not only gives you access to other programs while playing EQ but allows
you to run multiple copies of EQ at the same time.  See readme.txt for more info.<br><br>
