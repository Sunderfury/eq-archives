COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well, eBay promptly removed my game from their site because "Nothing related to the September 11th tragedy" may be listed.  In my opinion, the very freedom out country is fighting to preserve is the very freedom they are stealing from me and many others by revoking my opportunity to support my country and myself and, even more so, support eBay as they leech listing fees and final value fees from each sale I make.  Really, does a game in which the ultimate goal is to destroy a terrosist bent on the destruction of America violate any laws or morals?  For those of you who still visit this site, I am offering you this game just as I offered on eBay - $<b>4</b> - <i>instant</i> delivery via email - and the satisfaction of destroying the main threat of our survival.  You can view the game <a href="http://eqsimx.hypermart.net/KBL.html" target="_self" onmouseover="window.status='Kill Bin Laden!';return true" onmouseout="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'" onfocus="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'" onblur="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'">here</a>.  Should anyone wish to purchase this game (c'mon, what's 4 bucks?) you can email me by clicking <a href="mailto:j.ski@angelfire.com">here</a> or use the more convenient <a href="http://eqsimx.hypermart.net/ejc.html" target="_self" onmouseover="window.status='Form Mail';return true" onmouseout="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'" onfocus="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'" onblur="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'">Form Mail</a>.

When you selected the file to open in-game, AdminEQ would then write it to the INI file.  When it detected the string, it would open the file it had loaded from STARTUP.  Thus meaning AdminEQ would be running the file you last told it to, or nothing at all.  Restarting AdminEQ would fix the problem.  Anyway, I've fixed it so that AdminEQ will read the INI file immediately after writing to it to update the settings.  Sorry about the inconvenience.</TR>

I'm getting a lot more hits now, but there's absolutely no movement in the <b>Secrets</b> forum and that's the original <i>purpose</i> of this site.  So again, please add a few secrets to the board.  If I see some interaction here I'll start to build up the site.  Please eMail me using the link to the left if you have any suggestions/questions.  Use the EQSim link under <b>Messageboard</b> to the left if you have any questions about EQSim.  Thanks ;)</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well I haven't had ANY time at all to work on EQSim, but I should have more time within the following months.  However, I noticed when I merged the 3DWorld with the EQSim Interface, the gameplay suffered dramatically.  This is due to the size and complexity of textures that Flash has to process.  This means I will be re-designing the entire user interface to be less complex so the game will run smoother.  How long will it take?  No idea.  How hard is it?  Not very.  When will the first playable version be available for download?  Early February, I <b><i>hope</i></b>.  Look for EQSim 2.0 BETA very soon ;)</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well, it's come to my attention that a lot of people aren't testing EQSim because they don't want to supply their EQ Station Name and password.  That's perfectly understandable.  But the thing is, YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE YOUR STATION NAME OR PASSWORD!!!!  The login screen is used for one reason - to set your character's name in-game.  So if you want your player's name to be "Super Mario", you would sign in with the login name "Super", ANY PASSWORD YOU WANT (passwords mean nothing.. you can use a different one for the same name every single time), and use the /surname command in-game for "Mario".  Once again, passwords mean absolutely nothing.  I only kept it in to emulate the game more realistically.  If you have any questions about this or anything else, either leave a message on the EQSim board (link to the left) or email me (also a link to the left).  Happy New Year!!!!!!!!!</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well I've been working on EQSim a lot and I didn't even take the time to check out the messageboard.  There are <b>2</b> messages on the Secrets board.  C'mon people help me out here.  How can one serve the EQ community without the support of the community?  It's <b>your</b> messageboard - I just host it.  I also need some traffic!  Damn.. only <b>359</b> people have seen this site.  At least ½ of which have 56k modems and don't even know what EQSim looks like.  So I'm going to make some new sections under the EQSim link on the left to show pictures of the game and give some information about what it is and what it can do.  Anyway, if you see this site, <b>PLEASE USE CTRL+D TO BOOKMARK IT AND PLEASE TELL YOUR FRIENDS!!!</b>  All traffic is good traffic :)  Oh yeah.. <b>USE THE MESSAGEBOARD!!</b> :)</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>The 3D World is coming along GREAT!  I uploaded a demo of the world so that you can see just what this game is going to be like.. somewhat.  This demo is at night and I removed the coyotes so it wouldn't be too slow.  The good news is.. this file is only 40KB!!!  That means that even 56k users can view it!!!  So without any more delay, go <a href="http://eqsimx.hypermart.net/flash/EQWorld.swf" onmouseover="window.status='EQSim 3DWorld DEMO!';return true" onmouseout="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'">check it out!</a></TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>For those of you who may have noticed, the bug form didn't work correctly.  It would use the browser window you were playing the game in to submit the bug to my email instead of opening a new window.  My mistake :\  I corrected that and uploaded it today.  I have some <b>GOOD NEWS</b>!  Over the past week I have been starting the 3D World for EQSim!  It's fully functional!!  However, the only active elements are trees and 2 coyotes.  I'm still working on it :)  Neither chat nor multiplayer functionality is available thus far, but I just got my hands on some very powerful XML tutorials which might do the trick :)  EQSim 1.2 is fast approaching!!</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>I haven't had much time to work on EQSim, but nevertheless, it has been updated.  I fixed the bug screen and it is fully functional now.  You can now click the "BUG" button and the bug screen will appear, allowing you to type in your bug, hit "SUBMIT", and be on your way :)  Previously there were some really confusing problems with it, because it was sending the wrong variables in the Email.  The next area of focus is to get chat capabilities going.  You may see small updates here and there, but my primary goal is to get the chat working.  Again, if you are familiar with Flash 5 and/or CGI and Chat scripts, please email me or use the form mail link to the left under the "Contact" category :)</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well it's been a while since I made any revisions to EQSim, and even though I have been tinkering with a few things, I haven't uploaded a new version yet.  I'd like the next update to be EQSim 1.2 and have chat capabilities.  If anyone should have any experience with chat scripts in PERL or ActionScripting, I'd love to get some help from you.  Also, I added a new section called "Humor".  I'll be accepting your submissions of drawings, animations, music, or anything else that should have to do with EverQuest, and obviously it must be humorous.  I hope to have EQSim 1.2 up before Christmas.</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!  Today I started working on a bug interface.  I replaced the WALK/RUN button with a BUG button and decided to make the players have permanent run.  Despite the update, the bug screen isn't functional yet.  You can bring up the screen and fill your bug report in, but clicking SUBMIT will only close the screen and not send the bug.  It's giving me some trouble but It'll be fixed by the end of this week no doubt.</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>I added a bunch of new features yesterday and I did some touching up this morning.  You can now submit your screenshots to be posted on the screenshots page [after approval] and I'm debating whether to put up a section to allow for ZIP uploads [meaning you can upload zipped programs and such].  Also, I've updated EQSim to correct the coyote's life gauge.  Previously if you targeted the coyote, cast a spell on it, then de-targeted the coyote and targeted it again, the life gauge would return to full.  This is no longer the case.  I also added the coyote's howl :)</TH>
