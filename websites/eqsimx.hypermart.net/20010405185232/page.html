It's MUCH more powerful, EASY to use, fool-proof to bypass the patch, and best of all.. no installation!!

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well, after much debate and testing, I've decided to revise the in-game interface completely.  The new layout will be very close to that of EverQuest's in that the windows are moveable and semi-transparent.  I apologize for the change but gameplay was much too slow when I incorporated the interface and 3D engine together.  There is a downloadable DEMO version of <b>EQSim REVISED BETA</b> available <a href="http://eqsimx.hypermart.net/files/EQSim.zip" onmouseover="window.status='EQSim REVISED BETA';return true" onmouseout="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'" onfocus="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'" onblur="window.status='·BUTTeR· [EverQuest]'">here</a>.</TR>

Just now I checked my mail and got a bug submission from "ocean bay" (which was the player's name in-game) which was blank.  So there must be a bug with the bug.. submitter.  Sounds funny.. ;p  Anyway, if you have something you need to send to me whether it be a bug or a question or suggestion.. whatever.. please use the new link above the "Exit" link when playing EQSim or in the EQSim forum under the Messageboard link.</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Wow it's been a while now since there's been an update here.  Recently I got some email from someone who is willing to help me make EQSim multiplayer.  Whether or not this is going to happen soon or even at all I'm not sure yet, but I'm hoping :)  Well at the moment I'm debating whether or not to keep this site up at all.  I'm getting a lot more hits now, but there's absolutely no movement in the <b>Secrets</b> forum and that's the original <i>purpose</i> of this site.  So again, please add a few secrets to the board.  If I see some interaction here I'll start to build up the site.  Please eMail me using the link to the left if you have any suggestions/questions.  Use the EQSim link under <b>Messageboard</b> to the left if you have any questions about EQSim.  Thanks ;)</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well I haven't had ANY time at all to work on EQSim, but I should have more time within the following months.  However, I noticed when I merged the 3DWorld with the EQSim Interface, the gameplay suffered dramatically.  This is due to the size and complexity of textures that Flash has to process.  This means I will be re-designing the entire user interface to be less complex so the game will run smoother.  How long will it take?  No idea.  How hard is it?  Not very.  When will the first playable version be available for download?  Early February, I <b><i>hope</i></b>.  Look for EQSim 2.0 BETA very soon ;)</TR>

  <TH><FONT FACE=ARIAL 
COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well, it's come to my attention that a lot of people aren't testing EQSim because they don't want to supply their EQ Station Name and password.  That's perfectly understandable.  But the thing is, YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE YOUR STATION NAME OR PASSWORD!!!!  The login screen is used for one reason - to set your character's name in-game.  So if you want your player's name to be "Super Mario", you would sign in with the login name "Super", ANY PASSWORD YOU WANT (passwords mean nothing.. you can use a different one for the same name every single time), and use the /surname command in-game for "Mario".  Once again, passwords mean absolutely nothing.  I only kept it in to emulate the game more realistically.  If you have any questions about this or anything else, either leave a message on the EQSim board (link to the left) or email me (also a link to the left).  Happy New Year!!!!!!!!!</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well I've been working on EQSim a lot and I didn't even take the time to check out the messageboard.  There are <b>2</b> messages on the Secrets board.  C'mon people help me out here.  How can one serve the EQ community without the support of the community?  It's <b>your</b> messageboard - I just host it.  I also need some traffic!  Damn.. only <b>359</b> people have seen this site.  At least ½ of which have 56k modems and don't even know what EQSim looks like.  So I'm going to make some new sections under the EQSim link on the left to show pictures of the game and give some information about what it is and what it can do.  Anyway, if you see this site, <b>PLEASE USE CTRL+D TO BOOKMARK IT AND PLEASE TELL YOUR FRIENDS!!!</b>  All traffic is good traffic :)  Oh yeah.. <b>USE THE MESSAGEBOARD!!</b> :)</TR>

It would use the browser window you were playing the game in to submit the bug to my email instead of opening a new window.  My mistake :\  I corrected that and uploaded it today.  I have some <b>GOOD NEWS</b>!  Over the past week I have been starting the 3D World for EQSim!  It's fully functional!!  However, the only active elements are trees and 2 coyotes.  I'm still working on it :)  Neither chat nor multiplayer functionality is available thus far, but I just got my hands on some very powerful XML tutorials which might do the trick :)  EQSim 1.2 is fast approaching!!</TR>

You can now click the "BUG" button and the bug screen will appear, allowing you to type in your bug, hit "SUBMIT", and be on your way :)  Previously there were some really confusing problems with it, because it was sending the wrong variables in the Email.  The next area of focus is to get chat capabilities going.  You may see small updates here and there, but my primary goal is to get the chat working.  Again, if you are familiar with Flash 5 and/or CGI and Chat scripts, please email me or use the form mail link to the left under the "Contact" category :)</TR>

COLOR=BLACK SIZE=0>Well it's been a while since I made any revisions to EQSim, and even though I have been tinkering with a few things, I haven't uploaded a new version yet.  I'd like the next update to be EQSim 1.2 and have chat capabilities.  If anyone should have any experience with chat scripts in PERL or ActionScripting, I'd love to get some help from you.  Also, I added a new section called "Humor".  I'll be accepting your submissions of drawings, animations, music, or anything else that should have to do with EverQuest, and obviously it must be humorous.  I hope to have EQSim 1.2 up before Christmas.</TR>

Despite the update, the bug screen isn't functional yet.  You can bring up the screen and fill your bug report in, but clicking SUBMIT will only close the screen and not send the bug.  It's giving me some trouble but It'll be fixed by the end of this week no doubt.</TR>

You can now submit your screenshots to be posted on the screenshots page [after approval] and I'm debating whether to put up a section to allow for ZIP uploads [meaning you can upload zipped programs and such].  Also, I've updated EQSim to correct the coyote's life gauge.  Previously if you targeted the coyote, cast a spell on it, then de-targeted the coyote and targeted it again, the life gauge would return to full.  This is no longer the case.  I also added the coyote's howl :)</TH>
