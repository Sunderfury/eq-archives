<p>On some of the other warrior boards younger warriors sometimes asks &quot;Should I put any time into doing LDon advs?&quot; <br /> <br />Normally they are told not to waste their time doing LDoN because DoN equipment is better and can be obtained in less time.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br />I disagree with this advice, which I'm sure isn't a surprize to anyone.   <br /> <br />First off there is a world of differance in what you need to tank the curently popular DoN missions and what you need to tank LDoN and similuar content.  Seconed I don't see many pre lvl 70 tanks tanking DoN missions.  I've never seen a pre lvl 65 tank do one.   <br /> <br />The major down side to doing LDoN adventrues is the experance is slower than some of the other content doable at the same levels.   <br /> <br />In the end most tanks can benifit from doing LDoN adv, mostly from lvl 55 to lvl 65.  And to better handle post LDoN content most tanks sould do enough aa to have CA, CS, and LR before moving past lvl 65.   <br /> <br />It is true that the DoN armor is better and requires fewer missions to aquire.  However unless you are in a raid guild you will be hard press to obtain Armor that is better than the NR and EF LDoN armor.  Therefore unless you have Armor that is better than the EF armor doing LDoN will not waste your time.   <br />So if you can upgrade any of your armor with EF armor LDoN are well worth doing.  Same with NR armor, however it is twince as expensive. <br /> <br />It is true that you can get great procs from DoN but what do you do until you ding lvl 70?  True there is the drop proc in bloodfields.  But you are going to want two good hate producing procs.  And even if you can't do enough adv to get the anger III proc, any proc is better than no proc.  <br /> <br />Another thing to remember are the drop aguments in LDoN adv.  You can get sta +8 (as i recall) from lvl 65 adv. Aguments for magic protection and poision protection etc are also worth having.  Sure at some point you will replace them with better, but the drop aguemtns from LDoN can take you a long ways.  There are also some great aguemnts that are sold by the vendors.   <br /> <br />And finally from what i've seen there is quite a bit of activity for tanks willing to do LDoN, remember a lot of caster spell can only be obtained from LDoN vendors.   <br /> <br />So in the end if you have equipemnt that will carry you to lvl 70,  Haste 36% or better, all the aguments you can equip, killer procs on your two best weapons, and never go lfging for more than 10 minutes then the other boards are right....no need to do LDoN.</p>

<p>I aggree with you. I think your right about what levels and everything. Good advice, unless in a Raid guild it's pretty much worth it, for nothing else but the augs sometimes. The experience you earn doing them, far as exp. playing your class will be good for you too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />On the note about tanking DoN's pre 70, you can... You can do them in OOW too. I am only 67 and nothing special about me at all, and I can tank them. Have done it in groups all level 70 but me as well, those suck though, LOL.</p>

<p>I disagree. At Level 65 LDoN is almost worthless experience wise these days. Post 50 If you go tank Draink Scar, Bloodfield, Nobel's Causeway, then Wall of Slaughter in OOW. you can get some very nice equipment drops, possible Tier 1 oow Armor(better then anything LDoN have to offer), Oow Augs(Mostly tradeable and much higher stats then LDON if cut by Jewelers) and enough plat to buy almost any gear you need from the Bazzar(namely new cultural armor), and good amount of exp. My warrior leveled from 51 to 70 and picked up about 100 AA's In OoW zones in a period of less then 2 months. In addition, I made well over 300K from the loot that droped along the way. Experience, gear and time invested puts LDoN as one bad alternative for those levels so I give LDoN the thumbs down for post 50's game. <br /> <br />GoldenQuak&nbsp;&nbsp;    70 Cleric -  Quellious <br />Goldendreamer   70 Warrior-  Quellious <br />GoldenBear      65 Shaman -  Quellious <br />GoldenCat       65 Druid  -  Quellious <br />GoldenHen       62 Enchanter Quellious <br />Goldenbones     62 Necro.

Nothing wrong with this but playing for many hours at a time give you a better chance to get into the groups that normally have the best drop camps.   <br />I'm also quite certain that the vast majority of the plat you made came from zone harder to tank than NC.   <br /> <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Experience, gear and time invested puts LDoN as one bad alternative for those levels so I give LDoN the thumbs down for post 50's game. <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />What you fail to realize is that in order to progress as you suggest a warrior needs to buy LDoN equilevent armor.  And he needs to buy it before he tanks in NC.  Which neams she has to earn the plat with out having access to most of the drop you sold to make your 300K.   <br /> <br />Furthermore the pre lvl 70 warrior that skips LDoN has a harder time holding agro (no anger III).  Has to use one inv slot for a haste item.

If you are even in the same Zone they get /ooc out. My first 2 peices are given to me by other groups. In addition to Tier 1 quest armor, various named from oow zones starting at DS drops some decent upgrades for most mid 50's tanks. If you dont know enought about OoW Tier 1 Armor and other oow drops then you should go research it. I have a issue with your statement especially the part about time invested. A single Ldon adventure takes at least 2 hours between getting the group together, get to zone in and finish the adventure. That is if your lucky enought to find people willing to do them these days due to the poor return in experience and loot. A level 65 High risk yields around 50 Points these days. (100 Adventure points at 70 for High risk) How much time do you think will take to get a full set of LDoN Armor?. Even at Level 70 running all high risk adventures it will take 14.5 Adventures or 29 hours of game time (assuming you can find a group and finish an aventure in only 2 hours), or around double that to 58 hours for normal risk at 50 adv points per adventure at 70, double that again for normal risk at 65 or 116 hours of game play to yield one piece of North Ro LDoN armor. 8-/. You can easily get much better return for your time spend in oow.  <br />-------------------------------------------------------------- <br />Quote: Here are some augs from LDoN that are probably better than any you can get from OOW.

The way I figure it if you wone three rolls for them you were very lucky.  But more likly you were Power Leveling your warrior in the zones you menctioned.  Even today i think those who two box are the exception.   <br /> <br />One more thing, what do slugworms sell for these days?  Last on I sold went for 15kp as I recall, but that was quite some time ago.   <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />In addition to Tier 1 quest armor, various named from oow zones starting at DS drops some decent upgrades for most mid 50's tanks. <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Which DS or BF armor drop do you consider to be an upgrade for a LDoN EF armor? Yes there are some decent drops in BF but I don't remember any that were upgrades for LDoN armor.   <br /> <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />OoW Tier 1 Armor quest items are left to rot alot. If you are even in the same Zone they get /ooc out.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />The question remaines...how many Tier 1 armor quests can you complete without getting drops from RSoD, WoS, and/or other high end OOW zones?  Or are you suggesting that low level warriors hang around the OOW zones hoping for someone to /ooc the drop they need?  Seems like a very big waste of time.  The point is you need EF LDoN or better armor inorder to obtain tier 1 drops.  That is unless you multibox, or camp your low level warrior off to the side of your higher level group and have them loot what would normally rot.   <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />I have a issue with your statement especially the part about time invested. A single Ldon adventure takes at least 2 hours between getting the group together, get to zone in and finish the adventure. That is if your lucky enought to find people willing to do them these days<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />From time to time I put together LDoN groups with either my 61 monk or my 53 pali.  From when I look at who is lfging to when we split the plat is normally less than an hour.  And often the group will do two or three more adv before breakinig up.  And about 50% of the time I'm the one that has to leave, so the group might even last longer.  The key is, if the right classes are not lfging I go lfg and solo. I would say that for the level ranges i suggested the avd time to do an adv is about 30 minutes.  And once LDoN groups are formed they do multipul adv.  <br />As far as the number of invites you get to which zones, only my lvl 70 warrior get more invites to OOW zones than to LDoN adv.  There are still a number of spell that caster need from LDoN content, and there are still aug, armor and other items folks want from LDoN.   <br /> <br />To summerize the time comparison <br />1. from lvl 50 to lvl 65 LDoN groups are far more common than eitehr DS or BF groups.  As I said earlier I've never recived an invite for either of these zones.   <br />2. Due to #1 BF or DS groups take longer to make than LDoN groups.  there is no insurance that onec you get your group together the camp you want will not be camped by a Farmer.  <br />3. You can camp the names for hours with out seening one pop. <br />4. Unless you are multiboxing (which i supect is what you did) even if you get the name to pop and if the name drops the item you need you have a 1 in 6 chance of getting it.   <br />5. There are very few items you can obtain from DS or BF that are upgrades for LDoN armor.  So you spend more time obtaining lesser equipment.   <br />6. When you complete your LDoN mission, you get your points, so OK plat, and there are name in LDon that have some decent drops as well. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />I had many augs that can be cut into +12 stat augs drop in Draink scar. 50DD + Stun aug in Bloodfield. <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />How many +12 sta augs do you have? <br />I have about 20 sta augs from LDoN. Yes a number of them have been replaced with better augs from later conten.  But I still wear a few of them.  The point being when I first walked into NC I have every aug slot filled with a aug that was benifical. <br /> <br />Of the augs you listed, short of the ones that can be cut, I didn't see any from DS or BF that were better than the ones I listed from LDoN.  The BF stun aug is good, I have one on my EoE but it is on my EoE because it is not near as good as anger III.  <br />Then there are weapons. There is a decent 2hb that drops in DS. And inspite of its lower usable level at the levels we are talking the GSoT is better.   <br /> <br />As for my knowlage of OOW.  I have tanked enough OOW zones for The Cleric, the Enchanter, and the Beast I normally group with to have all but one or two OOW spells from runes. They got the rest of their spell from pick up groups. I have also helped Some other caster friends obtain a number of their spells. <br /> <br />Now granted this means that most of my time in OOW was in zones harder then DS and BF.  However I have played alts in these zones, and also teamed up with friends who wanted some of the drops. <br /> <br />As for the level of my toons, they range from the 20's to lvl 70, and I have high lvl toons on 3 different servers. <br /> <br />As for how long I've been playiing.  I bought the game 1 month after it came out.  My guild hit it's peak during SoV.  We were raiding places like HoT.  Fighting over loot caused a number of splits in my guild, and for the most part ended our raiding.  However our core group continued to raid with other guild until OOW.  This was mostly GoD content and lower PoP content.  Now a days we focus on one group content.   <br /> <br />I find it intresting that you recomend zones that have never been popular zones for grouping, and then complane about the amount of time it takes to get a LDoN group. It is my experance that due to the spell that cansters can only get from LDoN, and the quality of armor, there are a number of folks doing LDoN at levels up to 65.   <br /> <br />It seems to me that your recomended path is only valid from multiboxing or Power leveling.  I base this on the fact that you never once menctioned the best lower lvl OOW zone. The only pre NC OOW zone that regulary has more than one group in it.  This and the fact that on the servers I play on, the zones you recomned are used by farmers, soloers, and Power Levelers, and have never been popular zones for grouping. <br /> <br />So yes perhaps you can get enough bazaar saleable items from DS and BF to buy LDoN level equipment.  But due to the lack of group in these zones, the rareness of the drops, and the amount of time needed to sell them in the bazaar it will take you far more on line time.   <br />The one advantage of OOW zones over LDon zones it the rate at wich you can gain exp.  However for what ever reason, most of the folks intrested in exp, ie those who have equipment they believe is good enough for the higher OOW zones and other such content, perfer to grind in the PoP zones.  On the servers I play on zones are populated by 3 diffrent kinds of people.  There are groups looking for great exp.  They do not camp DS or BF. There are groups looking to upgrade their equipment, maybe 1 in 10 of these will group in BF.  Then there are Soloers, Farmers, and Power Levelers.  or those who do not need others to obtain their objetives.  These are the ones that camp DS and BF and more and more domonate the best NC camps.  </p>

<p>LDON's have been largely forgotten.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone are the days of BB camp being so full that it caused you to LD when zoning in from L Fey.  With all the high end zones with better exp, why would anyone want to do an LDON post lvl 63? <br /> <br />First, you can do hard missions at lvl 63.  Yes, there are 'some' item drops that make it worth it (but not many).  The main reason to exp in LDON post 63?.... /drum roll <br /> <br />&gt;&gt;leadership exp&lt;&lt;  For those of you who were lax in grinding out your lower levels, you can still get the largest return per hour invested doing LDON's for leadership aa's (Hard LDON's).  Some people like to grind aa's there too, but I consider them old skool purists (considering WoS, ect..). <br /> <br />As for low level LDON's.  It's still a good place for newer players to ply their combat trades.  EXP isnt 'bad', its all in finding a good group.  Unfortunately, I have had to do LDON's (with alt's) at lower levels without a good healer (sux, died 3 times).  I dont do lower LDON's anymore unless I know the players. </p>

Dull stone of sorrow is +5 all stats. Gem of the chosen ones is +15 hp/mana/end, and Ruddy Garnet is +25 hp. All 4 drop in Dranik's scar. There are other +25 hp augs that drop in Dranik's hollows and harbinger's spire. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />The question remaines...how many Tier 1 armor quests can you complete without getting drops from RSoD, WoS, and/or other high end OOW zones?<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Four, if we accept your definition of RCoD and WoS as high end. <br /> <br />Spire control shards, Kuuan traitor stones, duskfall chronicles and Dranik blood standard all drop in Nobles causeway, and sicne the last is for wrists, you can actually get FIVE slots filled with Tier 1 armor, without ever passing NC. And don't try to say you need LDoN armor to tank there. I have done NC groups with groups where every member is below level 60, and not well geared. <br /> <br />Also, I should point out that many pieces of magnetized armor drop in NC/Bllodfields/DS so with a friendly smith around, you could fill slots with magnetic armor until you get the tier 1. As a smith,m I can tell you that most will be willing to do combines, either for skillup chance, out of friendship, or if neither of those are the case, for a small donation. I have personally made full sets of magnetic for at least 5 different people, out of pieces they brought to me for combines. <br /> <br />Having said all this, let me say that I am not anti-LDoN. I used to really enjoy doing LDoNs. My over 150 adventures in LDoN netted me a total of one N-Ro armor piece, and 3 augments to go in it. It would have taken even more wins, if I had started at level 50, since they gave fewer points per win.LDoN's can be fun, and I am certainly not saying not to do them, but seriously, don't expect to get a SET of gear from them. <br /> <br />Now, my reason for bringing that up: It would be ridiculously time consuming to even attempt to fully equip in a set of LDON armor. There is absolutely no comparison between OOW tier 1 and LDoN. I have a friend who had EVRY nodrop item for the OOW tier 1, except for chest and legs, and the only thing holding him back from finishing, was faction, which still took a tiny fraction of the time that it took me to earn my LDoN BP.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Then, factor in the cash drops, and bazaarable stuff, and it is no contest at all. <br /> <br />But, if you like LDoNs go ahead and do them. They are fun! But They are not a fast gearup path. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Mon Oct  3 18:05:41 2005 by xaanru</span></i></p>

<p>The original subject of this thired was should young warriors spend any time doing LDoN. <br /> <br />I say yes for the following reasons. <br /> <br />1. Some of the stuff you can get from doing LDoN is better than almost anything you can get pre lvl 70.&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger III agu is the best example of this. Also the 36% haste aug.    <br />2. On the servers I play on, LDoN is some of the most popular group content until the mid Sixties.   <br />3. If you play with a regular group the casters in your group are going to want some of the LDoN spells.   <br /> <br />How LDoN equipment compares to lower OOW equipment. <br />1. As I recall EF LDoN armor is &gt; Magnetic. <br />2. As I recall EF LDon armor cost 760 Adv points. <br />3. Due to the frequency of OOW drops, random or from name, it takes less time to get your needed armor slot filled doing LDoN than it dose doing OOW.   <br />4. OOW drops do not sell for nearly as much as they used to.   <br />5. When you out grow your LDoN armor, you can sell it for augs that can be used on DoN and other kinds of armor.  The Magnetic etc sits in your bank.   <br /> <br />Dose this mean that you should obtain a full set of LDoN armor? <br />No but it dose mean that doing LDoN is worth while.  This is even more the case since it is still popular content upto the mid 60.  The point is doing LDoN, isn't a waste of time.  Even if all you get are the drop augs, I would say that for most warriors the sta augs that drop in LDoN are better than a +5 to all stats aug. <br /> <br />Concerning the comparision between teir 1 OOW armor and LDoN armor.  I would say that fully augmented NR armor is compariable to unaugumented teir 1 armor.  I also know many people who had full sets of LDoN armor, and I know folks who have nearly full sets of DoN armor, the slots that are not DoN are teir 1.  But I don't know anyone with a full set of Teir 1 Armor.  So it must be that Teir 1 one armor takes more time to obtain than either LDoN armor or DoN armor.   <br /> <br />Concerning what armor is needed to tank NC. <br />This is some what a function of which buffs you have, and the quality and level of the healer and slower etc..  But lets assume that you are restricted to the buffs castabel by folks in your group.  And lets further assume that all menbers of the group are at the level you would bgain hunting in NC. <br />This was the case when OOW came out for a lot of folks.  At that time I would say you could tank NC with LDoN EF armor, Ornate armor, maybe the SoV quest armor, and maybe with the higher end player made armor.  A lot of folks went into NC with sets of the above armor or combanations of them.   <br /> <br />Now since OOW you can add manatic.   <br />Now I will ask you what armor do you need to go behond NC in OOW.   <br />And how hard is it to obtain enough of said armor to move on to the next step?</p>

My 62 monk has 2 of the no drop pieces, and I have probably played him in OOW for a total of 5-10 hours, and I wasn't even trying to get the items. To get an EF armor item, at 760 points, and then aug it out to the equivalent of tier one OOW, would take far longer. <br /> <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />I would say that for most warriors the sta augs that drop in LDoN are better than a +5 to all stats aug. <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Below lewvel 65, the best stamina aug that drops in ldon is +6 in the hard, and +5 in the normal. I would tend to place +5 to all stats, including stamina, above +6 to stamina (assuming of course you're high enough level to get a +6. The DS ones are doable untwinked at about level 50). <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />But I don't know anyone with a full set of Teir 1 Armor.

Both were 65 at the time. The SK was wearing Dark Prince regent armor, and the warrior wore fierce heraldic. We camped the benches area in RCoD, and were able to keep the spawns cleared all the way from Granitesmash to the snake lady by the bridge. In WoS we usually took a murkglider cave, since the trains outside the caves were pretty bad when the zone was new. <br /> <br />So the answer is, to tank beyond NC, you need easy to make tradeskilled armor. It's a piece of cake to get enough to move past NC. <br /> <br />The biggest problem people have in OOW is perceptual. People HEAR that you need X hp and Y AC, and they assume it's true. Most of the time, what they mean is, with a horribly unbalanced group, or very distracted members, you can get by with an overkill tank.</p>

So it must be that Teir 1 one armor takes more time to obtain than either LDoN armor or DoN armor.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />Ill agree with the comparision between DoN and OOW armor, as DON armor is way to easy to get, but not to LDON armor. I would say it takes even more time to get the LDON stuff with it fully auged. Yes, there are many more folks with full NR armor than full Tier 1 OOW, but LDON was out a full year earlier, so the comparison doesnt mean much.</p>

<p>Closing Statment <br /> <br />Orignal Point <br />My recomendation was that young warriors not skip doing LDoN (as has been rcomended on other boards) for the following reasons: <br />1. LDoN is a popular content for levels up to the mid sixties. This is due to the fact that casters need or want spell can can only be obtained via LDoN <br />2. The Higher end LDoN items are good enough to use until Level 70 <br />3. When you out grow your LDoN items you can traid them in for 40 Hp agus that can be worn on most armor. <br /> <br /> <br />A number of posters agreed with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br />Goldenquak disagreed with me suggesting that young warriors should instead progress by hunting in DS, BF, NC, and WoS.  He based this on the belief that experance is better and you can get some very nice equipment drops including teir 1 armor. Since I consider NC and WoS to be content for levels above those I recomended I based my comparision between LDoN and DS, and BF <br />I disagreed with progressing via these zones for the following reasons: <br />1. DS and BF have never been popular zones for groups of any level. Never has any of my toons recived an invite to group in either of these zones.  These zones are dominated by soloers and farmers, and Power Levels.  Today noone has clamed otherwise.  If you can not get groups in the recomended zones it is inpossable to level in said zones.  This point alone should dismiss any real consideration of following Goldenquak's advice. <br />2. To progress along the OOW path a tank needs to have armor of the same quality as that obtained by doing LDoN adv.  No one has challenged this point.  To tank NC and higher OOW zones you need to have armor equil to EF LDoN armor. <br />3. Time invested, and teir 1 armor.  It was suggested that you could get teir 1 armor.  Obtaining Teir one armor takes a great amount of time.  Most folks I know only got a few items.  The reason DoN armor was/ is so popular is not because it is signifecent better than OOW teir 1, but because so many people needed it upgrade LDoN armor and other armor that is of lower quality than Teir 1. If teir 1 armor could be obtained by the avg player for the same time investment as LDoN armor was, most players would of entered DoN with full sets of teir one armor just as they entered OOW with full sets of LDoN or Ornate etc armor.   <br />Depending on names to drop an item you want taks as much and often more time than using points to buy the item you need. This is even more the case if you have to roll agenst a group inoreder to loot the item.  <br />Other drops in DS and BF are not upgrades for LDoN class armors.   <br />High value random drops do happen, but are rare enough that unless you are PLing you could hunt in DS and BF until the mobs turn LB without winning a roll for one.   <br />5. The main job as a tank is to hold aggro. If you skip LDoN your ability to hold aggro will not be what is should be.  The BF aug is nowhere as strong of hate produce as angre III. <br /> <br />Now I do agree that the exp in the OOW zones is signiffecant better.  And I recall staying if you have LDoN equivelent equipment there is no need to spend time doing LDoN content.   <br />However you will need more than LDoN class armor to level up in DS and BF.  You will need to bring your owne group or someone to PL you.  ON the servers I play on, Groups are easier to obtain in LDoN, PoP, Velks, Veksar, OS, and SG than they are to obtain in either DS or BF.   <br /> <br /> </p>

<p>WJ brings up some really good points. Though you dont NEED the LDON armor in the mentioned level range, it certainly makes life easier. <br /> <br />The only disagreement I have is with this: <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />1. LDoN is a popular content for levels up to the mid sixties. This is due to the fact that casters need or want spell can can only be obtained via LDoN <hr size="1" /></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This statement can vary widely from server to server. On some servers, LDON can be quite popular. On some, however, such as my serer, its not that popular at all. <br /></p>

<p>On my server Ldon's are only popular with people that don't have the newer expansions, bassically, you don't find a sole at the Ldon camps anymore.... It's sad, but true. Ldon's were a great expansion, but newer content has trivialized it badly. You can obtain Aug's at mid range in the first zone in OOW, easier then in Ldon's.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />When I first started playing this game, I was lucky to get to the Orc camp, and actually be able to kill one without ending back up at that log (Nektulos Forest) with a group of friends that just started playing as well. I remember going into the Commons where Uber level 40 people would buff us up. I remember when I had to run to destinations to group with friends for certain reasons, and to be scared the whole trip, of being killed by mobs that don't even get encountered anymore. <br /> <br />This is the evolution of the game. It's not that Ldon's can't benefit anyone... But Ldon is about the same as a guild going to Kael, to get drops for the Thurg armor quest, it's not happening anymore. I remember when that BP For a WArrior that could heal you for 100 points was uber, and you went to POJ the first time, and healed up with it, everyone asking (Are you sure your a Warrior?). Those days are gone, DoDh has MM's that drop decent stuff, DoN has some nice stuff on the merchants, OOW drops decent gear for any casual. Their is just too much content that is just as easy, and gives alot more Experience, then Ldon's, to worry about doing Ldon's anymore. I would like to see more take advantage of all the content, but that's just a dream for old school players, that want's everyone to have to go through all the stuff they did, to get to thier level of progression. These days it only takes a month or two, if the person has the desire to get there. Some of us do like all the content, and do go kill their, even though there is nothing their for us. Most do not, at least on my server.</p>
