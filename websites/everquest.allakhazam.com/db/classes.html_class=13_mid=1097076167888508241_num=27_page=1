<p>1. Debateably. Some say yes, it does, some say it doesn't unless you go all-out debuffing (Listless Power + Feckless Might + Suffocate), altho I think debuffing would be more effective at your level than at mine (as in, debuffing loses it's potency against higher level mobs). <br /> <br />2. Ostensibly, I could see it used in low level duels to make the victim fizzle more. No idea if it does anything to mobs. With how easy it is to twink up a toon's stats nowadays, basically nothing. <br /> <br />3. As in jewelcraft? There's other posts here dealing with it, but visit www.eqtraders.com for recipes, and stay with stuff just a lil above your current skill. Not really worth doing to high levels unless you plan on getting the AAs for it. <br /> <br />4. You can give it a shot. It helps to be sowed. You have a pacify spell (Calm at level 20), so just paci mobs near your target, then pull it with Tash or Slow if you want a lot of aggro, or a dispell (Cancel magic and kin) for easy to lose aggro. This topic is also covered in detail elsewhere on this board. Do your homework before trying it, and have fun! <br /> <br />5. Can't help you here... never duo'd with a bard at around that level. Perhaps something could be worked out with charming. Seems like it would be an odd combo, but would have a lot of potential. Happy hunting!</p>

<p>Doh hehe... well, my advice on spells wouldn't change significantly from the last time we discussed the subject (under the thread &quot;Debuffing... worth it?&quot;, when you were level 25), just plug any upgrades into your current usual spell lineups, the exception being Augmentation... minor stat buffs do not make up for a loss of 12% attack haste, in my opinion. Stick with Alacrity for haste. <br /> <br />A good tip, also, is to always plan to have a spell with a fast refresh time in your eighth spell gem, so you can swap it out for buffs like haste or clarity, and then swap it back in.</p>

<p>Okay if I understand your question correctly.... <br /> <br />I am a level 70 enchanter (DING!) and from level 1 to level 70, this is what I had in my spell slots: <br /> <br />1: SLOW (Whichever slow it may be at your level) <br />2: MEZ <br />3: TASH <br />4: DISEMPOWERING (i.e. Cripple, etc..) <br />5: SELF RUNE <br />6: OTHER PLAYER RUNE/NUKE <br />7: ROOT!!!!!!!! (Saves your ass unless the mobs summon, but that still helps for screwing up agro long enough to get your butt away!) <br />8: GATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (This is THE MOST IMPORTANT SPELL!  Would NEVER take it down, many times has the puller pulled WAY to many mobs and I either hear the word RUN or just flat out KNOW that it is COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE to stop them without a death!) <br /> <br />And now with my 9th spell slot, I usually have number 7 and 8 bump down to 8 and 9 and leave number 7 for group haste, since it seems to wear off before any of my other buffs (i.e Clairvoyance/GoD). <br /> <br />Just a suggestion, you could switch the spells in any order you wanted, but I would seriously suggest having that same combo up at all times, after all you ARE the chanter, you are there to slow/mez/haste, no other buffs are necessary, unless you have a shaman, in which case, NUKE AWAY!!!</p>

<p>Later in the game, up until around 60, I usually included at least one stun, often two, in my lineup to keep healing or gating mobs in check. I would occasionally load three for the sake of chain-stunning. <br /> <br />I also rarely memmed gate because I would rather have died trying to get a situation in check than run away. Running away (gating out) can look bad, and many is the time I'd saved others by sticking it out when things got bad and given people time to either get things under control or get out. When gating out is not an option, you have fewer options to choose from, making decisions as to what to do that much easier, and saving a group from a wipe with snappy decision-making rocks... even if you die. <br /> <br />I never ran at someone else's order. I have given the order myself while trying to get the mobs in check, I have run myself by following my own command, but I have never been the first to try and flee, and sometimes been the only person to die by virtue of buying everyone else time to get out with tash, stuns, and mezzes. I do make it a priority to get the cleric out first, if a cleric is present and a wipe seems inevitable. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sat Oct 16 15:46:42 2004 by jonnypanic</span></i></p>

<p>I would still seriously suggest it, because <br /> <br />1: People don't like getting trained, in WoS especially, if you have enough hit points and AA's concentrations, you can successfully gate while being beat on by a mob or two.  Spell haste always works. <br /> <br />2: You happen to not be invised and a TRAIN comes along, well, you're telling me you would rather die than gate, that doesn't make sense. <br /> <br />3: If the puller/tank/anybody says to RUN, you better be guaranteed I'm GONNA be runnin', no sense in dying from a stupid pull and ESPECIALLY when the puller admits it is stupid and says to run, never would I die if I know it's inevitable. <br /> <br />People aren't going to be upset if you run when a death would be unavoidable, and if they do, that would tell me the person isn't an understandable player. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sat Oct 16 19:48:23 2004 by fatbass</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sat Oct 16 19:52:50 2004 by fatbass</span></i></p>

<p>I did, of course, mem Gate anytime I was travelling. I never memmed it in group tho. If I was trained or training while on the move, I'd just try to avoid others and attempt to force a gate to avoid giving people grief. <br /> <br />But if I was in group and we were told to run, I'd usually be last if I could help it, making sure everyone else gets out and trying to derail said train. We are, generally, well equipped to do just that. And if my grabbing all the aggro with a well-placed stun or aoe tash meant the group spent less time overall recovering from the train, I was perfectly willing to eat a death. And, honestly, in such situations, it happened a lot less than one would expect, altho it still happened sometimes. I was mildly proud of being able to at least derail a train just enough to get my mates and myself out. <br /> <br />It just looks better if you die trying. And, maybe it's just me, but it felt better, too. I ditched that &quot;aggro = run&quot; panic mentality a long time ago, and it made me a better tactical enchanter. I was proud of my mob management skills because, basically, I never gave up. <br /> <br />Just like others' spell lineups, though, others' opinions on keeping Gate memmed in group may be different. I just completely put it out of my head to open up a spell gem for other options. <br /> <br />Edit: P.S. Yes, I am a control freak. Just a bit. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sat Oct 16 21:09:09 2004 by jonnypanic</span></i></p>

<p>I have to tend to disagree that people wouldn't be upset if a chanter cut out and gated. I am use to WoS as well, and deaths are common in that zone, more for the tanks and clerics than any other class. I don't know about on any other server but mine, but when characters die in that zone, especially the group's cleric, a simple drag to one of the many groups in there can get the cleric up and going again. <br />I think the exception to this gate thing would be if you are bound at the IZ or somewhere really near. <br />This game has evolved so much in 5+ years of me playing that I can say one thing for certain. Everquest is now a game of risk versus reward. If anyone, any class, is not willing to take the risk, then why should he/she get the reward? Death is common in our line of work, but if someone says run in WoS, they are plain stupid. Running creates trains and trains kill multiple groups. We can gate, but what about those who cannot? We have an obligation to the group to help them survive. Maybe if people stopped the Karnor's Castle mentality in that zone and others like it, it would be a little more homey. <br /> <br />A personal example I would like to share from WoS with you all backs up what I say to the &quot;T&quot; IMO. I was part of a group in the NW caves and my wife (66 clr) was the healer. We had a tank with about 7k hps (a bit low for these mobs), but he was managing in another camp (portals). We decided to move to NW caves for a named that was up and the tank pulled the first ukun. The tank died on the pull since he didn't have what it took to deal with the procs that the ukun like to use. So there we are no tank and a very angry mob at 92% life. The ranger called run, and my wife (clr) starts taking off out of the caves for the zone. I turned to her and said, &quot;Where you gunna run to?&quot; She answered, &quot;A zone.&quot; I said come back here and we will be fine, so she did, but not without some company that she and others had agroed. The others, including the ranger, saw the cleric turn around and they followed her back to where I was tanking this ukun. I saw that some mobs were adding to the battle from these fleeing groupmates, and started snapping off mezzes, 3 in total; The whole time taking the hits and getting healed from the cleric. Once those mobs were controlled, I said to the group, Kill this ugly thing, and we did. I was able to tank this ukun and keep 3 mobs under control with nothing more than a cleric, runes and a determined group. <br />Later I received a tell from the BST that was in my group saying that I tanked better than the SK we had. My point is simple here...things happen in this game that change the course of engagements in a heartbeat. We could have been weaklings and run away and died tired, and had a group of corpses strung out through half the zone, possibly killing more than just us. But we didn't, we stayed there and prevailed because we used our skill and our professionalism to exact a different outcome. <br />I will always pop a mezz off in place of a gate. I believe anyone who is afraid of losing that 1% from the 96% rez you get in that zone, shouldn't be in the zone at all. Granted my example started out as a single mob and ended up into a bad pull with 4 mobs in the battle, but I have many similar experiences involving 3-4 mobs on the pull in that zone. An experienced puller will sacrifice himself before he trains the group, but if he doesn't, we are there to do the job of controlling the mobs. <br />I would not expect a group to wait for me while I ran back to WoS after having gated, rather than trying to do my main job in the game. <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sun Oct 17 19:15:58 2004 by Prostea</span></i></p>

<p>Although I'm low level (I got 30 though, about to hit 31 :D) I agree. We've been fighting in the Overthere, and the Saber Tooth tigers have seemed to be unmezable (Perhaps I'm not powerful enough yet) <br /> <br />But, taking the information I've learned from here, in-game experience, and a couple of beatings, I'd have to go with the mez-over-gate thing. The only time I have gate memed is when I plan on using it. I'm not worried about trains, because if there is a train I can't control, it's normally one I was in. Other than that, and trains heading my way I normally pull for my group instead. Then we thank whoever pulled all the creatures for us. If I listened to everyone else and ran, well, then I wouldn't be leveling like I have been. I've died twice in the Overthere thus far. Once because I was tanking a Sabertooth Tiger so the group could finish off a handlefull of lesser mobs to handle it (I always direct them to handle the lesser mobs first, because it keep the stunning from going up), and the Cleric had decided to either go AFK, or didn't see my health drop. The other time was a bad pull on my part. I tashed a saber tooth tiger too close to a second one, and a rhino came with it. The group handeled it fine, but they let me die to learn a lesson I guess. <br /> <br />Enthrall doesn't take as long as gate to cast, and has an instant refresh rate (as far as I see). Along with mem blur, I can normally quell a train easily, and have xp fodder for my party.</p>

<p>I have to agree with the other martyrs here. An enchanters job is crowd control if it that means hightailing it out of there, I just have to laugh. Can you imagine a riot in a city with cops in full blown crowd control gear sent to control the situation, and having half of them just run when things start to get even a little hairy? Excuse me for saying, but if you were in my group and was more worried about running/dying rather than taking on the situation and adapting to it, I wouldn't want you as a member. I was in a pickup group for an LDoN and the leader asked if I had soothe/lull spells in order to pull singles. I told him I had that as well as ready to do any CC that any situation would call for. The first pull I was asked to lull 2 targets before the puller pulled the 3rd in a room. After a while the leader knew that I would do my job as an enchanter because of the way I handled situations as they changed. He never once had to aske me to do anything else and he wasn't worried about bad pulls because he knew I could and would pick up any messes that were dealt. I was doing my job as the chanter in the group as well as the puller doing his, and the cleric doing her job. It was a great group and we had fast xp and some close calls, but since everybody knew what they was doing, and everyone knew everyone else would do their jobs nobody had to die or even worry about dying. I've seen lots of players (mostly noobs) run at even the slightest of troubles. I laugh when I see this because I remember when I first startd playing that I did the same thing. Now I remember all the times I've ran versus all the times I've stuck it out. Running has problems like training group or other groups, making it halfway or close to zone and still dying, trainging the zone line which in some cases makes for harder re-entry because of others retraining zone, etc. Lots of bad affects of running. Yet when I tend to stick it out and I find most the time we usually make it through with little or no deaths in the group. No trains to zone, no mass CR's and or REZ. but always a good satisfaction that we adapted to the situation and handled it accordingly. I know there are times when it is better to run, but it shouldn't be the first thing on your mind. I use to mem gate because I didn't want to die. Now I rarely mem it in group and usually only when it's needed, if I was a wiz/druid with port this would be different. I'll mem it for solo-ing sometimes but mez is always before gate. After all gate is a benefit self only spell while mez benefits the whole group. And if I'm counting on the cleric for heals I sure as hell be able for others to count on me as CC. </p>

<p>Later on, debuffing is okay, but mainly for raid target mobs. Cripple will take a little bit of ac from a mob, which is nice. Also, it prevents atleast some procs. for every day mobs, cripple and other debuffing items are kinda lackluster. <br /> <br />I guess having gate up at your level isnt terrible, but i wouldnt advise it after 44. Its very cowardly and youre not gonna make many friends by gating quickly. <br /> <br />You can tell if things are going to go badly, and usually, can stall it well enough that you can load gate and cast. <br /> <br />Tash, Mez, Stun, Rune, Nuke, Clarity, Haste, Slow. <br /> <br />Thats what i use as my main line (not including a 9th slot). Albeit im level 67 atm, but thats what id shoot at, ive never really needed anything else, often, ill replace my stun with a charm. <br /> <br /></p>

<p>A neat little trick to keep in mind is this : If you right click on the spell book icon below your spell gems, you can actually name and save the set of spells you have up at the moment.  This way you can switch between multiple sets of spells more easily, without having to actually open your spell book and flip through pages to find them.  I find this handy when changing from buffing a group to fighting a mob, and also if (alas) you were to die.</p>

<p>  I often play my sisters 65 chanter and leveled it, 1-60 in 4 days (this was when KEI and virtue stuck on lower lvls, and just before they nerfed the Delightful Orb Of Forgotten magic which used to proc a 300DD). at your lvl of 29 I would normaly suggest DL specialy SE ruins but I found that on 11-26-2004 the incredible spawn rate and mob quanity was nill, and I had to PL my friend in Gunthak on the beach.  OT is awesome because the mobs are spread out, dont agro for the most part (excepet the sarnaks). But for quick XP-as a chanter I suggest charm fighting (if you duo with bard or druid have them snare mob-otherwise pull one to you camp and mez it then charm it. Use tash to pull a mob -root it (so you dont have 2 mobs curbstomping you when charm breaks). The beaches of Gunthak is perfect for pulling and not getting mugged by adds and wandering bobs, or suicide pulling by the tunnel to zone if youre getting a PL. <br /> <br /><b>1: Does the Disempower work effectively? (Listless Power, Feckless Might, Disempower) </b> A: I dont use any type of weakening spell untile PoP, or named camps because up untile 55 you really dont have that much mana to waste and less downtime=more casting. <br /><b>2: What exactly is the use for Curse of the Simple Mind?</b> <br />A: except in PvP situations, this spell has no real use and is not practicle to use against NPC mobs <br /><b>3: What is your suggestion for jewel combination? </b> A;Slow, Selfbuff rune, PC/rune, haste, root, slow ,mez, tash. <br />I never have or use cripple or other disempowering spell unless its a LONG fight, have a druid or low lvl cleric healing, or a shammy/bard is in the grp. <br /><b> 4: I'm level 29, should I consider pulling? </b> A: I would only pull if your tank has a awesome agro taunt, or you have a snarer, and only if you have a spell like boggle to get rid of the agro-otherwise camp the GY! <br /><b>5: Got any ideas where myself and a 29 Bard can fight without getting our butts handed to us?</b> A: see my first paragraph. Gunthak/gunthark is awesome at 29, unless you dont carer about faction  and go to HH and kill bards and such. <br /> <br />Divinehate Retirred 65 cleric <br />Dvinehatte Retirred 58 druid</p>

<p>Simple suggestion that I use an awful lot:  Save one of the &quot;Saved&quot; Spell lineups (you get 8) and name it &quot;Temp&quot;.  It seems that you need a spell lineup slightly different based on what zone/mobs you face, and what the group makeup happens to be in this individual case.  Leaving a quick recovery spell in slot 8 is very good, and when you load a temporary buff or whatever in 8, you can restore your lineup quickly by recalling &quot;Temp.&quot;  Otherwise, when I try to rely on reloading or switching spell slots, we get adds or whatever... Temp can be way to VERY quickly restore back to fighing trim... </p>

<p>I have to throw in my two cents...(probably about what it's worth, he he).  I know I spent LOTS of time at lower levels soloing my Druid and Monk, and got into a habit of running away before it was really necessary because if I waited, I would usually end up dead.  Now I am working up an enchanter and have her up to level 44, but have a completely different outlook with the chanter than I do with the other classes.  (I also have a Warrior, a Ranger, and a Wizzie that I play infrequently).  As an enchanter, I usually group up and as such have come to be much more of a &quot;stand and fight&quot; player.  I know a few buddies who have done a lot of charm soloing as an enchanter and they seem to pattern themselves more like my monk and druid, but other chanters seem to prefer groups and are more of the  <br />&quot;don't panic, fight&quot; type players.  I can't say either is always right, but I do think your past history has a tendency to affect your play style.  In any case, I would encourage the group leader to make sure all agree what the strategy is if they get into a situation. <br /> <br />Just for amusement, I will relate a reall life situation that I encountered early in my LDoN exposure.  We had a cleric join the group, and my druid was relegated to nuker and backup healer, a role I love by the way.  It soon became evident that the cleric was more concerned about maintaining her mana than keeping the tank alive.  I did what I could, but eventually the tank died, and we got 4 or 5 adds.  I was a little miffed that the cleric didn't seem to be doing much healing, but struggled as much as possible to heal, and finally called for an Evac when I was down pretty far in health.  We evac-ed successfully, except for the cleric who was still at full health but nowhere to be seen when we had all zoned thru to the succor point.  We were inquiring where she was when she came running around the corner and zoned before we realized what had happened.  Before you could say &quot;Dang&quot; the full mob (and I mean mob as in a whole, great big BUNCH of mobs) came running along and killed every one of us except the cleric who had zoned to safety.  It wasn't very hard to do as all of us were at 5 percent health or lower...  As mad as we were, I still laugh my head off every time I think about it.  BTW, the cleric never even zoned back to rez anyone, just disappeared and I never saw her again.  Just as well, since I was prepared to give her some lessons in group behavior....))</p>

<p>As an enchanter I play the stay and fight type. I hate when players run off at single sight of danger. I also hate when druids or wizards have itchy trigger fingers on evac. For the most part the main healer or CC player in the group should call for zone or evac. <br /> <br />Also as an enchanter when somebody does something they shouldn't IE: break mezz. You should let them know what to expect and to watch for it in the future. For those of you that arent enchanters and haven't played one. You really need to listen to what the enchanter says and is doing. CC is a fine line job. The scales can be tipped very easily. But it's great seeing a chanter do their job. <br /> <br /> <br />I was in a group in City of Mist once and every time we even had 1 single add the cleric would scream &quot;ADD! ZONE&quot; and hightail it to the zone line. Meanwhile I had all the adds mezzed while the rest of the group dealt out dps. I laughed so hard and it happened 5 pulls in a row. Cleric screams and runs. Funny because half the adds were from her training zone. I still laugh at that one.</p>

<p>City of Mist is a GREAT place to hone your cc skills. So are Ldons. They really show how good of a chanter you are. <br />Chanters should NEVER be the first to run. What you do, is try to mez, stun root, as many as you can to reduce the deaths of your group. while telling them &quot;if there are a lot. like 10+&quot; to run, and you follow close, or ahead, to root/mez them as they come..  <br /> <br />Anyways. as for spell slots..I have a few set ups, I even named one for Ldons, Com, and later Pov.(plane of valor) <br />Basically this is my typical set up <br />The first 3 are a constant <br />Tash <br />Nuke <br />Root <br />Dot-may replace with charm, or aoe mez. <br />Mez-if the mobs you are fighting can be mezzed. <br />Slow <br />Haste <br />Mana Drain *you get one at about lvl 34* You can replace with pet spell or gate.. Or Rune series <br /> <br />Of course, some zones, like pov &quot;well in the 50's at least&quot; my set up is more like this <br />Tash <br />Nuke <br />Root <br />Dot <br />Cripple <br />Weaken <br />Slow <br />Haste <br />Ldons. <br /> <br />Tash <br />Nuke <br />Root <br />AoeMez <br />Mez <br />Haste <br />Manabuff <br />Mana-Drain <br /> <br />Ifyou have aa's (when you get that lvl range) and get the 9th spell slot I sugjest gate.. Incase things get harry. <br />*edit*  <br />And by hairy, i meen one of those really bad groups that cant pull worth a damn, and watch as the mob comes chasing after you, and decide to hit the othermob, you mez it then they come and hit it again.. <br />That or an Unrealistically large train of death.. Like the entire oow zone being pulled, and your in its path. <br />*edit* <br />Also, I often replace my slow. or Haste with Rune V <br />Simply you dont need to always buff, so i swap out rune V and haste. and sometimes i just have haste and rune v up, replacing slow. &quot;if theres a shammy in group.&quot; <br />Simply because later in the game Rune Series can keep you alive an extra 5 seconds.. and well. sometimes thats all you need. &quot;ie spam rune again, so cleric can get off cheal and warriors can taunt.&quot; <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Wed Jan 26 20:20:02 2005 by unicornstar</span></i></p>

<p>I agree with the rest of you in that if things get rough... that is what we are here for. For an enchanter to be the first one out the door tells me (and most likely everyone else) that they either do not know how to play their class (seeing as how we are pretty well equipped to deal with any given situation that may occur)... Or... that individual just doesn't care enough about the people they are grouped with to actually DO their job. In either case I wouldn't want em representing our class. I don't believe in gating when things get rough..  <br /> <br />As for the spell slots.. I find that it varies depending upon the classes in my group/ zone. Certain places have their own strategies and mobs that are immune to different things. My basic set is this: <br /> <br />Tash/Root/Mez/Slow~~~&gt;if no shaman otherwise its Strangle/self rune/player rune and the other two are either mana theft spells or stun..sometimes an extra nuke... really depends on where I am going... but I will be switching it up some after reading some of these posts on pacify/ mem blur. Always willing to try new things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /></p>

<p>Im just adding in my two cents. . .but anyway I completly agree with the statement . . .<div class="msgquote"><div class="msgquotesrc">Quote:</div><div class="msgqorig">I would rather have died trying to get a situation in check than run away.</div></div>  <br />Because being the &quot;traffic cop&quot; of everquest to me would signify that in the chanters own right should be giving out the &quot;speeding tickets&quot; and if the situation would call for me to die in the line of duty so be it. Dieing really isnt that bad. Even though I think that the quote could realisticly be applied to other classes as well.  <br />Here's a little scenario. You are in a group of lets say 4 members not including yourself and your puller makes a bonehead pull and death is seemingly absolute. Wouldnt you rather have enc slow/mez or whatever and give you enough time to escape(maybe still escape themself),then one who flees at the first sign of possible doom?  <br />Furthermore, staying behind, although it could be considered noble, really isnt that much of a sacrifice. I mean death isnt all that bad. Considering you can usually get a 96% rez, losing a whole 4% of your exp is a small price to pay so the rest of your group doesnt have to as well. So with a rez the worst part is having to spend the loading time to get to your corpse. <br />Anyway i suppose that this is alot more than 2 cents so I guess I'll have to stop before im broke. Sorry about any misspellings,grammer or pronounciation.(heh) <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Tue Mar 22 07:27:03 2005 by MummraTheEverLiving</span></i></p>

Dont be afraid of agro either.  Learn to love your Rune spells.  You get some really good ones around level 60.  Like Arcane Rune, Uproar, Ethereal Rune (AA) etc.  These will save your life.  They're similar to DA for Clerics, but you can still cast while it's on you.  You have carte blanche with the mob when pulling.  You have three choices when pulling.  You can tash it, slow it, or dot it.  I used to always pull with Tash, but I found it's a better opportunity to use a slow. <br /> <br />5. You and your bard friend may be able to take some mobs in the Overthere.  But it may be risky.  Another choice is HHK. <br />------------------ <br /> <br />For crowd controlling in a hairy situation <br /> <br />ex: 14 goblins mobs and two hasted pet geared pet's in Nurga <br /> <br />Chain stunning works the best. <br /> <br />Here's how my line up goes <br /> <br />NORMAL: <br />1 - Tash <br />2 - Slow <br />3 - DOT <br />4 - DD <br />5 - Mez <br />6 - Rune <br />7 - SWAPABLE <br />8 - SWAPABLE <br />9 - Gate <br /> <br />CHARM: <br />1 - Tash <br />2 - Slow <br />3 - DOT <br />4 - Charm <br />5 - Mez <br />6 - Rune <br />7 - STUN <br />8 - STUN <br />9 - STUN <br /> <br />when charming, and you pet breaks, you can chain stun it and get enough time to recharm it and send it back after any mobs you were killing. <br /> <br />Using stuns removes the need to really root or mez and add.  It just get's stunned with whatever you have targetted and will say put till it dies (meaning the team will kill it, not the stun).  But remember that our stun spells are all PBAE (Point Blank Area of Effect) spells, which means that you must stand next to the mob in order for it to actually hit him.  <br /> <br />Hope this helps. <br /> <br /></p>

<p>I want to comment on enchanter pullers. <br /> <br />I have made a point to develop my pulling skills. <br />I have pulled in AE groups in many zones, i have pulled for raids like Fear, Hate, and the POP zones and one thing i have learned is that we rock at it if properly trained. <br /> <br />It does take practice but we are the all in one puller (if only we had feign death there would be no need for another puller class. <br /> <br />1 use pacify to get the mob you want, pull with tash-root it as it aproaches your party-slow it-mind wipe it and send in the tanks on a rooted preslowed mob.  Then relax till the tank has the agro or go pull another mob.  if your good at it the party or raid can have constant killing while you have the mana and at high levels i never run out.  I use way less mana pulling and slowing myself that playing crowd control mezzing 4 to 5 mobs on mad pulls and if while pulling i get extra mobs i can mezz or AE mind wipe them and continue pulling only the mob i want.   <br /> <br />Practice this solo for a while trying to get use to controlling the pull and when you master it you will be able to solo more effectivly as well. <br /> <br /></p>

<p>Curse of the Simple Mind <br /> <br />this is great in the BB LDON against the casters.  It stops their cast and ups their fizz rate.  I strip them down and others attack.</p>
