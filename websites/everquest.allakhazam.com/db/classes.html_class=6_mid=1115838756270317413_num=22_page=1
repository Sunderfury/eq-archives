<p>Well guys looks like we have been hosed again. The new patch shows that most if not all other classes have had significant improvements to their line of spells with the exception of guess who.....THE PALLY. I have been playing EQ since inception and my main toon is a Paladin and ever since the addition of the Kunark expasion the pally class has been taking hits. So if sony wants to do away with the Paladin class I just wish they would go ahead and do it. Tells us to fall on our swords or what ever they want us to do. Hey how about this idea, they can hold a one time event in the arena and lets us all get permanently killed by some monster of their choice. </p>

<p>What exactly do Paladins need improvements with? You fail to mention what we're lacking. You cry nerf when other classes have simply gotten upgrades that they needed; also if you'll take a look at the spell list, the ones pre-50 are lowered in the level needed, and one of the best I've seen, is our much improved healing spells, making us life-saving tanks, as our job entails. Besides, they're not entirely done yet. Send /feedback of things you want to see improved for Paladins; does no good sulking about it here.</p>

<td valign="top" class="mform" width="100%">
<p>Ok I will give a few examples. First of all lets make a little comparison between our class and lets say just for fun ....the Bst class. In the this last patch the bst class now has a heal spell at 62 that does 1044 hp when before it did 428hp's manna went from 175 to 331 which means we heal at a rate of 2.74/mana where as the bst class heals at a rate of 3.15/manna. Our heals at that level have been reduced in amount but not in manna spent. Now the first argument I hear is that we have higher ac. Good argument except for the fact that the bst class has the pet to mitigate the damage it can take so the ac argument goes down the drain. I have been playing my current pally since shortly after eq came out of beta testing. At that time the pally class had its role in a group. We were a second tank with a specialty in stunning and undead. This brings me to my next example. The number of undead mobs vs. other types has been getting worse and worse. I feel confident that those who read this can count on one hand the number of zones which are primarily undead and of those that are undead heavy most are lower in level. Pre Kunark expansion we had zones which were almost exclusively undead example being UR. But since that time the need for a group to have a pally has been getting smaller and smaller. The one and I feel only bright spot there still is for us pallies is our ability to stun but don't close your eyes because I predict that other classes will soon have that ability also. Yes there are some real issues with the pally class and I have have touched on a few of them. By the way boy has it gotten harder and harder to find a group for my pally and to be honest except for our ability to be a weak meat shield we really have no role now.</p>

<p>I am a Beastlord, and I tend to agree that Sony has &quot;hosed&quot; the pally class.  Beaser makes a valid point when he gives the example of the Beastlord spell Chloroblast getting a great boost. <br /> <br />I am eternally grateful, but feel sorry for the poor old Pallys who did not get equal healing bonuses on the latest patch.  I know that class rebalancing is an ongoing mission of SOE, but in my opinion, Pallys need some love.  I have a solution! <br /> <br />Pallys currently kick the crap out of undead, n'est pas?  How about giving them a class-specific line of spells vs. &quot;evil&quot; creatures?  I define &quot;evil&quot; based upon the deity that an NPC worships, (i.e. followers of Innoruk, etc.).  The Paladin should be able to dismiss evil classes just as efficiently as they dismiss the undead. <br /> <br />Thoughts? <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu May 12 11:06:09 2005 by Tallymorm</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu May 12 11:06:15 2005 by Tallymorm</span></i></p>

<p>I agree with the assessment that pallies didnt get anything out of this class realignment. As pointed out here, the argument that they didnt lose anything or were a good class before is utterly besides the point. <br /> <br />If other classes keep getting enhanced while the pallies are frozen in time, then the pallies get degraded. The pallies cant solo anything at all, more and more classes can (bst great example). The best single heal now gets equalled by rangers and nearly equalled by other mellee classes - a BLOODY JOKE.  <br /> <br />If you take all the advantages away from being a 'hybrid tank', then nothing is left. Up to lvl 55 we could pull well. Pacify is gone now too beyond that and we cant even pull a tothless grandmother. Others, like SK have FD or lull and thus can still pull and tank. All that is left is some puny groupheals and stun aggro - wonder when thats gonna be nerfed, because our class is so uba. <br /> <br />As far as undeads are concerned, you gotta be kidding me. There's virtually NO ZONE LEFT that would have undead content interesting to groups at high end. I like this idea to change to anti evil. <br /> <br />If you want to make a real rebalancing, <b>at least give us pacify back</b>! Finally this alleged adjustment that we can now tank better has not happened either. ABSOLUTELY NO discernable change yet. On the contrary, with the monk ac upgrade looming, we now compete with monks for ac aug drops more than ever. SONY, YOU ARE ASLEEP as far as pallies are concerned. <br /> <br />Did we get hosed?

<p>The new Unrest &quot;instanced&quot; zone is a pally's dream.  I did it last night with Targlor, (who started this thread) and we benefitted greatly from his new line of undead dd spells. <br /> <br />I still think that there are too few undead zones, so why not add evil npcs to the list of what a pally can deal good dps toward?  Maybe a line of deity specific dd spells that begin at level 50.  That would be cool for you pallys, imo.</p>

I want to see a difference for the paladins. Before I ever played a paladin, I loved how easy (in the high levels) the made tanking and my own healing look. After I made the paladin, I wanted to see him become like some of the incredible paladins I saw and as of these recent patches, he's felt weak.

<p>Well, this sort of confirms my point.  <br /> <br />These 'nominal' increases of heals by up to 100hp (lol) and maybe tinkering with casting times while increasing (!) mana doesnt make any difference whatsoever. So stop citing them as 'they are working on it'. It is much more important to let us tank more efficient or pull again. And nothing is moving in that regard other than a puny disc like mitigation for ueber bossmobs which we are unlikely to tank in the first place. <br /> <br />The frustrating thing is that I just can't see anything at all in the works that would address the serious issues. A classic in this regard is the pally epic 1.5 which is such a joke given that it is weaker in ac/stats than the cookiecutter high level shield/1hs combo while giving slightly higher dps (which is not why pallies are in a group anyway). <br /> <br />And yes - /feedback sent many times in a polite fashion to no avail. Maybe I should start to rant instead of being polite in /feedback.</p>

<p>I have come to a theory about why Paladins are always being &quot;Hosed&quot;.  Of all the hybrid and melee classes, Paladins have some of the best if not the best self-buffs.  Therefore, Sony gives Paladins the lowest unbuffed stats of these classes but thier self-buffs make up it.  This should make all the classes pretty close to equal.  The problem comes in when a character gets temperance or virtue or some buff other than the ones they cast themselves.  Since Paladins have the lowest unbuffed stats, they maintain that deficet once they are buffed with the same buff as another hybrid or melee class.   <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sat Jun 11 11:15:22 2005 by gothinone</span></i></p>

<p>  I'm tired of hearing all the whining about being nerfed good grief you are sounding like a bunch of monks. If you don't like what they are doing with our class or are jelious over the upgrades other classes are getting then play another class. If you wanted to be a healer you should have been a cleric or if you wanted to be a warrior that's what you should have been and there are plenty of pet classes out there If you wanted a pet to take damage for you. I'm going to continue to play my paladin like I have for the last 4 years. <br /></p>

<p>sorry, I`m with Necro &amp; Tommas - whilst things are changing they`re not necessarily for the worst. And although I raised an alarm about Touch of Nife spell, I`m pleased to say I was proved wrong.  <br />My first toon was a warr but I wanted more to my repetoire than melee.  I started my pally and haven`t looked back - she`s level 63 now and although I`m a tad frustrated about the paci line stopping at 55, I`ve just adapted my pulling technique &amp; moved on.  I was warned I`d lose interest after 60 but I`m getting more and better groups now than I have for a long while. I MT, assist, main group heal, back-up heal generally all in the same session but in different situations or group mixes.  I regularly group with another 63 pally, 63 ranger and 65 chanter and we just take BoT apart with or without a cleric/shammy (`proper` healing type). One pally tanks whilst the other heals, then we swap duties when the `healer` is low on mana.   <br />I not usually a happy, Pollyanna type (in fact `grumpy` and `irritable` might sum me up) - but for me my pally is the bees knees and I just want to keep extending what she can do, if there are limitations to the class just acknowledge them &amp; understand what you can do to work with them.</p>

<p>I preface this by saying I do love playing the Paladin class.. was the very first toon I ever made,  and has been my main the entire time I've spent in EQ. <br /> <br />I do not wish to play another class with any degree of seriousness,  and to say *go make another class*  when the real basis of the thread is not about what we NEVER got,  but about the fact that other classes upgrades are (arguably) larger than ours.  Sure the whiners that say *why dont we get Invis,  why dont we get this and that (things we never got and would be out of the scope of what  Paladin is supposed to be)*  perhaps need to select a class that would better suit them, <br /> <br />in short...  I still love the base strengths that a Paladin is founded on.   yet, I do wish those strengths would increase by the same amounts as the other classes' are. If SoE decides they dont need to be..  then I will tango on. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu Jul  7 20:48:33 2005 by JustUsQuellious</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu Jul  7 20:49:13 2005 by JustUsQuellious</span></i></p>

<p> I must say I liked my usefulness better at lv 55 than I do now at lv 70. Necro what you fail to understand about our healing spells is that a 3.8 sec 1250 heal isn't useful at all when the mob your tanking is hitting you for 2500 during the time it took you to cast the spell and bashing you 2-3 times so that your very likely to get interrupted. As the spells casting time if far to long as a blast heal and to weak as a main heal the spell is only usefull to help heal after battle when the cleric is LOM...even then putting the mana into stuns would prevent more damage than the heals...ie its a near worthless spell.  <br />   <br />   Next paladins are always whinning cause they have a reason to. Paladins used to be kinda a jack of all trades character...do every thing but nuke but ,not as well as the pure classes, but as other classes kept getting better after lv 50 the paladins upgrade spells were more spaced out over the levels and weren't as good. First after lv 39 our healing spells seem to drop off while the clerics keep going up at a good rate...then our paci spells went by the way side at lv 55. Then after lv 64 mobs our root spell is so unrelible it normaly breaks instantly or within 10 sec of casting it 2-3rds of the time. <br /> <br />  Next our weapons are still the best but not by the great margens they used to be so we don't even come close to 1/4 the damage of even a strait melee bard. Our weapons were the best to make up for our down fall of not being able to duel weild..so we were at least doing 2/5th the damage of a warrior. Next stuns...before oow came out we had a AA stun( divine stun) that lasted for .0 sec with a like 1.5 casting time that could hit up to lv 67(2 lvs higher than us) so we could interrupt spells casted by higher lv named mobs and push them back if need be...even tho most of the time if it was a lv 65+ mob it got resissted alot of the time( and its not worth the AA's IMO). In oow the new AA stun only hits up to lv 68 and cost a woopping 15 AA's...umm big woop you can't even stun stop spells  on names in WoS with it and at lv 66 the first spell is a stun that hits lv 70 mobs. Kinda messed up wouldn't you agree? The only ability we have going for us is Slay undead..but sony nerfed this as well...you used to slay undead for like 10k but after the nerf it was like 3-4k with a decent weapon. Even as there became better weapons that could get a slay undead for 7k+ sony didn't need to nerf it because there wasn't anymore undead mobs to use it on...I've had SU maxed for like 4 months and the only time its used is during phase 3 of the plane of time.    <br />     <br />   But there were a few things sony did do right as far as OOW was concerned. First and foremost was the Blade of disruption...finaly paladins could put away there crappy Blackblades of the rain that only hitting for just over 100 if you were lucky and go to hitting for 200+...other classes started getting close to 1 to 1 ratio weapons but finaly I actualy felt like I was final atleast knocking a few % off of each mob instead of fractions of 1%. Next is the spell Light of piety, final we have a blast heal...altho weak yes, we were VERY happy to get it. Mobs 5 lv under me could still knock off the healing amount after only 3 seconds after I casted it, but I could still help the healer heal me in battle...which is very useful if your a bit weak for that next named mob. <br />  <br />   Then again there something sonys been doing to tanks sence after kunark and it really gets my goat. Thats grouping bards and cleric in with tank armor. This drives me up the wall to no end and its really the only part of the post you can call a rant ,but I have a point here. When sony does this the ac of a item goes down and the hp isn't as high as well as giving less stamina/str and more stats like charisma and int ( which are near worthless to tanks). They try to make one item for 5 classes and its just doesn't work well. It gets even worse in places like the Plane of time!...Lotsa nice tank items drop that are just total obviously ment for a tank and there all/all...meaning everyone wants them and the tanks have to fight pure casters and slower for items that other classes shouldn't even be able to wear. Then again they also have +5 mana regen items with improved fire nuke damage that are all/all that are obviously ment for casters. Sony really should make a heavy plate class for tanks and a platemail or light plate class items for clerics and bards.  So the light plate could have mana regen and improved sings and the heavy plate could have the hp/ac tanks desprately need. This is where all the bards and cleric start whinning...because they can slap a mana aug or charisma aug on tank items and its alot better for them than the stuff they normaly would get if sony did it the right way. But no sony won't... why? ,because that means they have to pay programmers more to make more items and thats just the way it is.  <br />   <br />  In DoN they finaly figured out many of there paladins were quiting the game because they just weren't able to get groups and behond the 90% rez , group heal and a few stuns they were nothing more than a very weak warrior. I know...2 months after oow came out I got only one group ....in 2 months...no joking. <br />So you see sony has picked off all the things that separate us from warriors for years. Can't paci...more like a warrior....can't off root...more like a warrior...heals are near worthless compared to other classes save for our gh...more like a warrior. <br />  <br />   Sony finaly made a attempt to fix a few of the problems because it was costing them money. They gave us a disc that blocks 25% of incomming damage for 30 sec...ok sonys trying thats about all I can say. If its only gonna be 25% damage its not of much use during a raid if the warrior goes down...so that leaves grouping....well if you can't tank the mob without it ...30 sec of 25% damage blocking probley isn't going to help you( 2 min would be helpful in some cases). They also did a fair( not good or great) job with the missions by having each class get there own armor to buy with the crystals...finaly I got high ac/hp without having to fight with all the other classes for it or camping it for weeks and weeks. To bad the damage was already done. The tanks that weren't 10khp and 1700ac+ pretty much all left or only log on here and there to talk to friends..atleast on my server. Every time I go looking for a group  theres normaly 2 cleric,  3 shamans,  5 or 6 rangers,  tons of pure casters and about 1/2 the time a chanter lfg. There never seems to be more than 2 tanks lfg including me. Tanks in most cases these days are the most sought after class when forming a group. So I guess its not all bad for me ,but its still not right.  During this whole post I haven't said anything about SK's the other tank class...why? Thats simple because I'm a warrior/cleric I see no reason to compare myself to other classes. I want to be a paladin...not a nerfed warrior or cant heal cleric that can take a beating. Plain and simple. One last thing isn't it about time that we should be able to summon food and water like a cleric? I mean they get the spell at what ....lv 8? Well even with all there draw backs theres one thing I can say....&quot;At least I'm not a wizard&quot; there the most nerfed class in EQ.</p>

<p>thousandson, thank you for taking the time to write a beautiful post that I can wholeheartedly subscribe to. <br /> <br />facts and sentiments I totally agree with. there is way to go for sony still in pallyland because if we do better now in grouping it is partially due to the fact of many tanks leaving the game. I for one would gladly drop my complaints about our by now puny singleheals for more potent and faster groupheals and the return of paci. <br /> <br />___________ <br />Tetriak <br />70 pall <br />and his merry band <br />69 shm <br />70 cler <br />66 chant <br />63 wizz <br />55 bard</p>

<p>I'll make it short:  <br /> <br />'way too much healing' aint describing it: as you said before, our single heals during combat can be near totally written off; after combat they can too as even our best heals take forever and way too much mana to give me even one complete heal at 11k+ hp. <br /> <br />our groupheals are just about the only useful tool but with ever increasing aoe spells and rampaging mobs out there that can get mean groupheals are mostly needed during combat and there they are nowhere near the 'way too much healing' marker given that they take up quite a bit of mana <br /> <br />i totally disagree on the sk comment - true, their tanking lacks and their aggro aint as good, but their fd does allow them to pull and we can't even pull a toothless grandmother; given that nearly all meaningful camps or missions etc require a proper puller these days and given that they are often in short supply, sony better do something about this quickly (if its not paci then they better extend dru's and ranja's to indoor) otherwise the drain is going to continue</p>

<p>[quote][/quote] <br />Necro what you fail to understand about our healing spells is that a 3.8 sec 1250 heal isn't useful at all when the mob your tanking is hitting you for 2500 during the time it took you to cast the spell and bashing you 2-3 times so that your very likely to get interrupted. <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> <br />If you are using your heals in combat while tanking, something is very wrong, especially against mobs that hit that hard. You should be worrying about stunning and mob positioning, not healing. Thats what healing classes are for. Heals are foruse for spot healing when you are not tanking, or for reducing down time. <br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />Apparently you have never tanked a Mob that your cleric couldn't keep up with and decided to help them heal you then. Some of the missions DoN have mobs in them that hit for 1700+ and even with 12khp and 2kac I sometimes see my cleric falling behind on the heals and its has saved me a long Corpse run more times than I can count to backup heal myself and sence (if you know how to play your paladin) we pull so much arrgo we can stop attacking for 1.9 sec and blast heal ourselfs for almost 2k that can let that next CH land and keep the group from wiping. What is spot healing but back up healing by another name...just try spot healing yourself on mob you dont think you can tank and you'll see what I mean. You will find out you can tank mob that you didn't think you could tank before. If it isn't a tactic you have developed then you should...thats the best part of having a blast heal while tanking. As for reducing down time I say again that putting your mana into stuns would prevent more damage than your heals would heal after battle. <br /> <br />Quote: <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />our root spell is so unrelible it normaly breaks instantly or within 10 sec of casting it 2-3rds of the time.  <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> <br />Personally, never had this problem. Yes, sometimes it breaks quickly, but nowhere near 2/3rds of the time. I would say 1 in 5 and most.  <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> HAHAHAH Im guessing you never tank in any zone harder then BoT. I've heard ranger complaining about this Sence OOW came out and not just paladins.  <br /> <br />Quote: <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />we were at least doing 2/5th the damage of a warrior <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> <br />If your DPS was this low, you either were very poorly equiped, or you were comparing yourself to warriors who were very well equipped compared to you. Compared to the warriors in my guild (who are similarly equipped) I do about 4/5ths the damage they do. Generally, they DPS around 130 while I am around 105-110.  <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />  <br /> <br />  Hate to tell you this but your grouping with warriors with poor weapons not me...I'm using epic 1.5 with 2h AA's and 2/5 damage of a warrior is pushing it...unless its undead then I CAN outdamage them some times if I slay undead. I also have taken my AA toward damage...IE max crits ,SU and 2h weapons even 2h bash. You need to turn on &quot;Others hits&quot; in options once in awhile. We paladins are WAY out done on damage....most warrriors in my guild are over 310 DPR and I'm just over 145 with epic 1.5 dpr on non undead. Don't even get me started on our rangers...there useing weapons from GoD that are dl 24 damage 36 and way...WAY out do me on damage! <br /> <br /> <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />Thats grouping bards and cleric in with tank armor. <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> <br />Ill agree that they should not have put bard with us, but the fact that they did doesnt hurt tanks, it hurts the bards. Bards have a heck of a time getting any drops becasue tank classes will fight for those drops like crazy. In a DKP system, tanks will spend tons of points to get a plate drop. Drives bards nuts cause they dont want to spend that many DKP cause they arent going to get quite the use out of it that a tank will.  <br />Putting clerics on the same armor thread, however, does make sense. Whicih class is usually the first target if a MT goes down. The healer!! They need all the protection they can get until another tank can step in. Lose the healer, loose the raid.  <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />Actualy It DOES hurt tanks because that means  we have to fight against bards and cleric for tanks armor. Meaning tanks( that use the armor EVERY TIME THEY GET HIT!) don't get the armor but 3/5 of the time instead of 3/3 of the time. As I've already stated that the ac and hp/ac goes down when they group clerics and bards in with tanks. Appeaently you have never been in a power guild or a true raiding guild...as bards aren't tanking for the groups they can afford to save up the raid points and spend outrageous points for one nice item because its doesnt really matter if the get it because THERE NOT TANKINGING for their groups! Same with clerics. Hay if the tanks dies whos gonna tank??? the cleric? Yeah right the monster is gonna interuppt there healing spells and there gonna die simple as that unless you have a backup tanks and if the MT died then its pretty likey the backup tanks is gonna splat too.... then your doing a CR. The cleric having tank armor has very little purpose  seeing as if there isn't another tank there to swipe arrgo the cleric is going to die anyway...enough said. Your only hope is evacing the party. <br /> <br />Quote: <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />I know...2 months after oow came out I got only one group ....in 2 months...no joking.  <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> <br />You must be doing something wrong then. As a 70 paladin who isnt even time flagged, I have no problem getting group. <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />  We are on diffrent servers and your not even time flaged so you have no clue how other servers work. You can't get groupes here unless your a 10k+ tank or you wait a very long time. I've been playing sence beta and I know what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /></p>

I should have been clearer that NORMALLY you shouldnt have to heal as a paladin. Occasionally, however, it is needed. I remember an LDON I was on and we got a bad pull and ended up with 4 mobs. Got through the first 3, but as we engaged the last one the cleric called OOM. I hollered for the cleric to tank (rest of group was pretty much cloth folks, and I stood back and healed.
