<p>A warrior is the Tank, the damage taker, not giver. There is a difference. As I read alot of forums, I cannot believe that someone as high as level 63 is gonna still complain about how much damage he can do on his warrior. I have a friend, Level 70, who still complains about how much damage he does compared to (Monk, Ranger, Rogue, take your pick) other classes. This is how class balance works. <br /> <br />At level 52, my Ranger had better Attack then my Warrior at level 65. &quot;WHAT??!!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Yes, it's true. I didn't have better equipment on my ranger, it's just the way the mellee is made. My ranger hit harder then my warrior, except for maybe the first 15 to 20 levels. THis IS Class balance. Although my ranger has a much better attack then a warrior at that same level, She cannot take no where near the damage as a warrior (With similar gear). Mellee classes hit harder, but get hit harder and more often then the tank classes.  <br /> <br />Warrior's get in the mobs face, and keep its attention <blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />by any means possible<hr size="1" /></blockquote>, this is the warrior's job. The warrior's job is not to nuke the mob for 5k damage, or shoot it for 3k with an arrow, or strike it with a 2h axe for 2k damage, or even Backstab for 500 damage. The warrior's job is to get in the face of the enemy, and keep it's attention. Warrior's wear Plate Mail Armor. Ranger's wear chain mail. There is a huge reason for this. The only time a warrior's job is not to be the main tank, is when a more powerful tank is present to do the job. Then your the alternate, if the main tank goes down, etc.  <br /> <br />Damage is not something a warrior has to worry about. Warrior = Tank. Tank's = Pally, Shadowknight and Warrior. Strongest tank = Warrior. Let the damage dealers worry about DPS, that's not the Warrior's job. <b>This is important, if you ever want to be happy with your warrior</b>. A warrior comparing how hard he hits with a monk, rogue, ranger or berserker is similar to a chanter comparing their nuke to a wizzy. The chanter nukes for 1400 damage, Wizzy then nukes for 5k damage!! OMG&lt; That's not fair to the Enchanter!! Yes, it is... I have a level 66 chanter as well, and DPS Is not my job, most the time. However, I may Charm a mob to help with DPS, but for the most part, my job is CC (Crowd Control) not DPS. Just like a warrior is helping DPS by hitting the mob, he/she cannot compare the damage by the warrior to that of a class that specializes in damage. <b>IF YOU DO NO DAMAGE AT ALL BUT KEEP THE MOB's ATTENTION ON YOU, YOU DID YOUR JOB!</b> <br /> <br />I know this has been said a million times, but I cannot help saying it after reading so many threads, forums, etc. on this subject of &quot;My Warrior is nerfed, I cannot even hit as hard as my friends Rogue!!&quot; How hard you hit is not the sole way to build hate.</p>

<p>I agree 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only problem I have with being a warrior is that we are the tanks so why is it soooo hard for us to keep aggro.  Rangers, Pali's, and SK can keep aggro better then warriors. <br /> <br />But yea... warriors are not about DPS we are about keeping aggro and taking the hits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />The only problem I have with being a warrior is that we are the tanks so why is it soooo hard for us to keep aggro. Rangers, Pali's, and SK can keep aggro better then warriors.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Of course they can, They cast! Matter of fact, any caster class can take aggro from us easily, if they really want it.  <br /> <br />The balance issure, or maybe just SOE don't know how to give it to us yet. I like to think it's a balance issue. Sure, you can be the best Tank in the game, but you will have to work the hardest at it as well. <br /> <br />They gave us Discs, augmentations, and probably working on some other great gifts for us Warrior's, but overall, I think the challenge is getting your groups to realise it's in their best interest to let you have aggro, and work on helping you keep it. <br /> <br />Example: I was once in a raid in Keal, My level was more than enough to handle all the giants up to the named in the Arena. We were working on faction and learning how to raid together as a team, this spot was picked for various reasons. There was a ranger that kept attacking the mobs as they come in, so much that I was actually running up to hit the mobs and taunt them off of him. He did this repeatedly after the Raid leader and another officer had warned him. My level was 66, his was low 50's at the time, and no way could he solo the named that we were starting to pull. He even bragged on how he was stealing aggro from me, although I wasn't even hitting the mob till he was already all up on it. I simply said in Raid Chat &quot;(Such and such, If I see you attack one more mob before I call assist, I will ask (The raid leader) to kick you out of this raid.&quot; There was alot of &quot;LMAO!!&quot; &quot;HARD LESSON THERE BUDDY&quot; etc. Bassically, people aren't fooling no one, and when you call them on it, they (This one did anyways) Appologize and never do it to you again. <br /> <br />My point to this is you have to teach players how to group and/or Raid with you. You know what your capable of better then anyone, so suck in your pride and tell them... &quot;Hey, please don't assist me till I call it&quot; Or &quot;Please assist after I have done 5% damage to the mobs&quot;. You will find most groups and even raids will work on your level.  <br /> <br />My warrior is in a family guild, No EP, No OOW tier gear, nothing uber at all, except a BOC I happened to roll luckily for (And I was second one to win, it dropped two). I have some Ornate, some OOW trash, and I have a belt from the DoN merchants. Level 67 warrior that has stats and gear equivalent to a level 55 warrior in a high end guild, if that. When I am asked to go tank somewhere like WOS, I make it clear to the cleric (especially) and the rest of the group, exactly what my HP/AC is, and how well, or not so well I can keep aggro. Most groups I have been in, where it's tough for me, I have been lucky enough to have people in the group that take on the responsibility of helping me keep that aggro, even if it means they can't hit till mob is 50% (Over exagerated,just making a point). <br /> <br />Think of yourself as the BEST TAnk, but if you want me, you better learn how to play with a warrior as MT.</p>

<p><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Honestly though, a warrior should not have trouble holding aggro on most mobs, unless someone else in the group is being dumb, or the warrior is undergeared compared to their group.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />I dissagree totally. A warrrior will not have any problem with keeping aggro in the group if the group works at helping the Warrior keep aggro. However if they do not take into consideration that warrior's do not have Stun, hate spike and the like, the warrior will have a problem, even if He/She has better gear then the avg in the group. <br /> <br />This is a legitimate concern. There are tons of Warrior's concerned about this fact. I learned early on how hard it was, having a friend (Using a Rogue) doing everything he could not to take aggro from me. His toon was geared about the same as mine, but was about 5 levels lower. My HP/AC was way better, and he would dissengage the mob altogether to help me keep aggro. If this were not a friend, and someone that knows nothing of this problem, it could have turned into a bad experience. <br /> <br />At level 67, with a BOC, no hate aug's, I still don't have a chance to take aggro from my monk friend, who has a Hate aug, and is level 70. He is what most uber call Uber, to be fair, but he's a monk...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />The Warrior should be able to fill their slot as Tank, even if not equipped as well as the rest of the group. A ranger at a lower level, less gear, etc. can play the part of tracker/puller in outdoor settings, as they should, not depending on equipment. Monks can add great dps without being above avg. Actually all classes can, even the Knights with their spells and such, can tank being equipped a bit lower then the rest of the group. If the tanks HP/AC and ability to take a hit is better then the other's in the group, they should be able to do their job, even if 5 or so levels lower. A group should be able to work with a level 60 Warrior, level 68 cleric, level 70 ranger, level 65 rogue, level 66 Beastlord and a 70 enchanter or shammy, just fine. This however isn't the case. The warrior will have a hard time keeping aggro... Put a Knight class in place of the warrior and you have a working group. Not because the Knight has better gear, but because they have other ways to incite hate, and keep it. I've actually seen a Pally get aggro from stunning the mob, throwing a heal someone's way the mob was looking at, the mob all of a sudden looks right back at the Pally.  <br /> <br />So I totally dissagree with the statement that a Warrior shouldn't have no problem if they are geared as well as the rest of the group. A Warrior not ABOVE the group average will have problems, unless the group works with the warrior on aggro management, meaning they may have to hold back, and sometimes that might make a huge difference in DPS, if the DPS in group has to hold back quite a while before doing their thing.</p>

<p>My point is, A Knight can hold the aggro better through spells, etc, making the overall DPS of the group better, since DPS won't have to hold back as much. I know there are end game equipped warrior's that don't have this problem, but I am talking about the avg. Warrior in avg levels. From 50+ Warrior's experience problems, and without getting the Aug's will continue, no matter what weapons they use (not counting end game remember). Even with the Augmentation's some Warrior's still experience these problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Yes, untill the warrior's have better tools to use, groups must make an effort to help the warrior keep that aggro. However, when I play my Enchanter, alot of times I would rather have a Knight as MT, or at least in group, cuz I know they can grab a mob off me alot faster then a Warrior. Remember, holding back also effects Tash, Slows, and other debuffs that really get mobs mad. This means that not only is DPS having to watch themselves, making DPS a bit lower, Also debuffer's will have to hold back a bit, so that the mob won't attack them right away. This means the mobs gonna be hitting faster and harder for a longer period of time, this isn't that big of a deal if the Tank can take the punishment, but it does use up a bit more mana on the healer's part, which can end up in the Healer needing to med more often. This all is reasons why some would prefer a Knight over a Warrior in a group. As you get into high game content, of course the warrior don't have as much of a problem. It's the mid to high levels (Before end game, and Highest level zones) that WArrior's are lacking.  <br /> <br />This thread is starting to go off topic a bit, we had a huge thread under &quot;The Magic of Taunt&quot; by Warrior Joe, on more indepth discussion of Aggro, Hate, and Taunt.  <br /> <br />I have read alot of posts on Warrior's complaining about there dps compared to a Ranger/Rogue/Monk, and who knows what other class, about how these classes are doing way more damage. I was trying to make a statement on how little DPS actually matter's to the Warrior, unless your solo or dueling with a healer of some sort. DPS in group/raid situations doesn't come from the Tanks.. Even Knights that have certain spells they can use to up DPS, when tanking, will be using there aggro and tanking spells, rather then worry about DPS.</p>

<p>I wasn't going to respond to this post but a warrior can only take so much missinformation... <br /> <br /> <br />Here are a few facts <br />1 In a normal fight for an avg pick-up group a warrior will generate more total hate than a knight. <br />2 Most of the time a warrior can get a mob off of a cleric faster than a knight. <br />3. DPS is aggro. <br /> <br />The stun of a Pali is worth 400 or so hate points. <br />The proc of the BoC is worth 700 hate points. <br />In a normal fight a Pali will not cast stun more often than a Boc will proc.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />The Pali is limited to two procs, the warrior can have 4. <br />The Pali has no bellow line which adds to instanious aggro as well as acting like a dot.   <br />A warrior hits more often than a pali, a warrior has better dps than a pali.   <br /> <br />I think what Anez means is a knight can control when they generate snap aggro.  At one time (early PoP) this was a very important ability.  And a lot of enchanters would not groups with warriors.   <br />Today however, warriors can generate enough aggro to hold mobs if given just a few more seconds than would be given for a knight. <br /> <br />As for other melee classes having to hold back on dps for a war vs a knight is a bunch of BS.  A warror geneates more hate each round than a knight, therefore dps classes can do more damamge.  Warriors generate more instant hate than knights do (higher hate procs and more hate porcs) therefore dps classes can do more damage.  <br /> <br />On getting a mob off of a cleric. <br />99% of knights atempt this by casting a spell. <br />Warriors do this with taunt. taunt works 90% of the time. In my groups 90% of the time the mob nevers even makes it to the cleric since i hit taunt the instant it truns and regain aggro.  Taunt is faster than a spell.  When taunt fails I use area taunt.  AT is no fail. Furthermore casting 1 spell is no insurance that the knight will get aggro.   <br /> <br />As Xaanru said if a dps class (say a monk) is consistantly pulling the mob off of a tank, then it is the monk and not the tank that is the problem.  Melee dps classes need to be able to adjust their aggro depending on the abilities of the tank just like caster classes do.  My monk has 3 lvl of dps/aggro that he switches between.   <br /> <br />There is one way to tell if a warrior is not preforming as needed in a group.  That is by the cleric.  If the cleric is consistantly getting aggro, or having to med, then odds are there is a problem with the tank.  And 9 time out of 10 the problem is with the tanks ability to take the beating being dished out by the mob and not with the amount of hate the warrior is generating.  If you healer get aggro only now and then, and dosen't have to med too much then your warrior is doing fine.   <br /> <br />In the end Tanks are often better equiped than the rest of the group.  Tanks are often higher lvl than the rest of the group.  This is do to the fact that lower lvl non-tanking classes can ride a bit tank for better experance.  However it is much harder as a tank to ride higher lvl nontanks</p>

<p><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />2 Most of the time a warrior can get a mob off of a cleric faster than a knight. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Not likely. You mention that you feel knights hit there stun first 99% of the time. If this is the case, paladins out there need some retraining. I use taunt first and follow that up with a stun to yank a mob off. Assuming the taunt works, I shoot to the top of the list and then give myself some padding with the followup stun. If the taunt fails, then I still hold a good chance of holding aggro or at least stunning the mob(I use a high level stun for this). I actually have a hot key setup to do this for me. Mostly use it in groups, but I did save an Agnarr raid with it once (Thankfully Aggy was still snared though <img border="0" src="/shared/smilies/grin.gif" alt="icon"/> ) <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />In a normal fight a Pali will not cast stun more often than a Boc will proc.  <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />Depends on how many stuns the pally can cast in a chain. <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />The Pali is limited to two procs, the warrior can have 4. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />How are we limited to 2?

Even with the Augmentation's some Warrior's still experience these problems. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />Yes, if warriors are fully equipped with Anger 3 augs and BoC/BoW and so forth, combined with their discs they generate insane amounts of hate. Chain stunning and pally DPS will not keep up with this (excepting paladin hitting taunt). Not all warriors in the 50+ range can get access to all of these. Warrios who lack the augs (and believe me, there are a lot out there) are immediatley way behind. </p>

<p><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />2 Most of the time a warrior can get a mob off of a cleric faster than a knight.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />When you say 'knight' are you talking about Shadowknights or Paladins?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Anez is talking about Shadowknights but from your references you seem to be talking about Paladins.  <br /> <br />Shadowknight vs Warrior Agro... <br /> <br />A war is going to have to Bazu bellow at 100 range to get agro (maybe get agro, hate increase of 600 cast time instant).   All your anger augs and hate producing procs are melee range required (not to mention proc dependant).   <br /> <br />SK ToD's and you have agro NOW (range 200, hate increase of 1800 cast time 1.5). <br /> <br />Taunt?  If you agree that sucessful taunt = top of hate list and a little more is true, then yes.  SK's have taunt too (remember?).  I dont know about you, but my agro now macrokey consists of /doability 8 (taunt) /cast 5 (Terror of Discord).  If the first one dont get you, the second one will.  I never have a problem holding agro.  Monks, Rogues, nukers, etc.  They can go full bore as long as I'm ALIVE (being able to hold agro and being able to tank are two seperate considerations I assure you). <br /> <br />Area Taunt?  What about SK Dread Gaze (SK's can cast this all day long while warriors are waiting for their AoE taunt aa to refresh). <br /> <br />I dont know what your guild make up is.  If you play with any SK as well geared as you are, then guaranteed, and SK have always had the AGRO NOW ability.   Not going to argue this point, go talk to your class correspondant who is bringing up the topic of SK agro superiority. <br /> <br />Back to the original argument.  DPS is utility, it increases hate generation.  This can do nothing but help a warrior maintain his place on the hate list.  Nothing wrong with that imo.  I think that Warriors should be able to do more sustained DPS then their Hybrid cousins (with the exceptions of monks and zerkers). <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Fri Jun 17 12:35:08 2005 by Necrophobe</span></i></p>

<p>Warrior Joe said <blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />In the end Tanks are often better equiped than the rest of the group. Tanks are often higher lvl than the rest of the group. This is do to the fact that lower lvl non-tanking classes can ride a bit tank for better experance. However it is much harder as a tank to ride higher lvl nontanks.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Missing another point I said here <blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />The Warrior should be able to fill their slot as Tank, even if not equipped as well as the rest of the group. A ranger at a lower level, less gear, etc. can play the part of tracker/puller in outdoor settings, as they should, not depending on equipment. Monks can add great dps without being above avg. Actually all classes can, even the Knights with their spells and such, can tank being equipped a bit lower then the rest of the group. If the tanks HP/AC and ability to take a hit is better then the other's in the group, they should be able to do their job, even if 5 or so levels lower.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Yes, A warrior with all the goodies does a great job holding aggro. However one that is lacking on any of these things will not do such a great job. AE stun I believe is a level 59+ AA, and keep in mind most classes in general don't really start taking off into there AA's till past level 60. I don't see many with ae taunt till 65 or higher.</p>

I don't mean MPG or even WOS for that matter. Remember I'm mainly concerned with the levels between 45 and 65, I know the higher AA's and the like enhance a Warrior for the toughest of mobs alot better then a knight's abilities do. The main thing I think alot of Warrior's are concerned about is being a wanted group member at least equal to having a Knight (Sk or Pally) would benefit the group. </p>

If you are suggesting that weapon (not proc) generated hate can not move you up the hate list then you are sadly mistaken.   <br />As an example my lvl 57 monk was recently in a LDoN with a warrior, a Palli, and a SK.  All of whom hand procing weapons.  None of my monks weapons have a proc.  The group didn't have the abiity to cast haste.  And none of the spells, procs or palli selfhaste could hold aggro for long vs my monks high dps and 76% haste.

And decided to come up with a test to prove or disprove the above statement. <br /> <br />Here is what I came up with. <br />A frined of mine group's normal tank was having problems tanking in WoS.  Their normal tank is a Pally.  They wanted some WoS drops and asked me to help tank while the knight work out the kinks. I assume they ment get more aa.  I suggested that the Palli keep pulling as was their custom so the my friend (chanter) could slow on or just after the pull.  Once the mob was at the camp I would hit auto attack and incite (didn't want to be overly uber using Bellow since not all warriors can easly obtain bellow) <br /> <br />The tell of the tape <br />Pali lvl 67, Warrior lvl 70 <br />Pali haste 34% Warrior haste 36% <br />Relevent aa:  Pali WA 0 Warrior WA 1  <br />Pali weapon <br />Blade of Disrubtion damage 43 delay 30 1hs.  Comes with Planar Stun. Agumented with SO Yak proc. <br />Warrior Weapon  <br />Edge of Evnelopment damage 44 delay 34 2hs. Comes with Sting of Aynoue, agumented with Bloodstone of Agony (a yak like proc. BoA drops in bloodfields and is easly obtainable by any one with a few feiends lvl 55 or so). <br /> <br />Results <br />Using HoTT the mob would switch from the Knight to the warrior at a hp ranging between 95% and 75%.  The differance being assumed to be the result of who proced when.   <br />There were a few casses of ping pong aggro.  But the vast majority of the time once the warrior gained aggro the pallie never regained it.  <br /> <br />Concluctions <br />A warrior using avg hate generating weapons, procs, and incite, producese signifently more hate than a Pallie using one of the best Knight weapons (for hate) in the game.  If we assume that the warrior alway made up the differance by 75% of mob health, then the palli would need to cast stun 4 time just to equil the amount of hate generated by the warrior.   <br /> <br /> <br />[quote][/quote] <br /></p>

<p>I think your missing a HUGE point Warrior Joe. It's not your fault though, no one is saying the obvious, which can be somewhat unobvious when not mentioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />On my Chanter, it's not the fact that the Knight can get a mob off me faster in Mellee range so much as.. They stop the mob dead in there tracks from SPELL RANGE. A warrior using a disc (If it's not during the two minute reuse stage) can do the same, to an extent. Alot of times I see the Disc not working as well when your not  in mellee range, as you see it work when in mellee range. Another thing to consider as well, You were 3 levels higher then this Pally, with a low amount if any AA's. You probably have some of your offence and defensive AA's no doubt, and with that comes more strength. This pally your talking about may be 3 levels lower then you, but I have a feeling he's like 200 or so AA's behind you... That is a HUGE oversight not to be counting. ALot of Warrior AA's are innate, and with your end game warrior, if you were stripped of all your equipment and reduced to using the Plate found in SOL B for equipment, I Have a feeling you would still be tougher then that Pally you were talking about.  <br /> <br />Your friend the Pally is the first person I have ever heard complain about not being able to get aggro... I have never heard a knight complain about aggro before.</p>

The tank has to loss aggro. <br />2. The Mob has to move from the tank to your chanter.   <br /> <br />If any tank with taunt is playing close attention the first should almost never happen.  First lossing aggro is not a common ocurance, if it is then there is some mistakes being maybe by the group.  A good tank that is paying attention knows the moment he losses aggro and can hit taunt before the mob gets out of range. If your chanter is having the mob reach her on a regular basis then mistakes are being made by group members.   <br /> <br />In the end you are trading snap aggro for a lesser chance that the tank will loss aggro.  Yes Knights have snap aggro, but then Knights, do to their lower hate generation rate, loose aggro more often <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Another thing to consider as well, You were 3 levels higher then this Pally, with a low amount if any AA's.

Procs, and it is acepted that a weapon can proc even when the weapon dose not score a hit. <br />2. Each time you swing your weapon, weather you score a hit or not, you generate a fixed amount of hate.  So according to this theroy the only advantage gained by the warrior being 3 lvl high is some increass in the amount of hate generated per swing.   <br />If you believe that the actual damage you do is a major factor in generateing hate from swinging your weapon, then warriors have a signiffent advantage of pallies do to a better melee table, and as i recall more crits.   <br />But you do realize the only reason you know the lvl differance, is becaus I stated it.  I did so; so that everyone would have all the information needed to draw their own conclusions. <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Plate found in SOL B<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />Nothing wrong with good old bronze armor.

In fact I said that she kept pulling so that MY friend the Chanter could slow early.)  The problem the group was having in WoS is the beating the Knight was taking.  I did say that once the warrior got aggro, save for a few cases of ping pong aggro the knight never got it back.  This shows that shortly after the palli  lost aggor she was far enough behind on hate that not even her proc could bring her back to the top of the hate list.   <br /></p>

<p>Oh, it was me missing your point. I wasn't trying to get into a hate/taunt thing again. I'm just saying that I prefer a Knight alot of times as Tank, like say in an Ldon, or somewhere my chanter skills are needed. The reason is simple, my spells are not always unresistable. So neither of the reasons mentioned above really count. If the monk comes back with 3 or 4 mobs, and even one resists me, I have one on me. It's easier for a knight to get that &quot;Instant&quot; aggro from this mob, where he has already used taunt or whatever one the mob he selected as the one to kill. While I'm juggling the other two or three, there are times one (sometimes all) can end up on me, not allowing me to do much. Soon as someone can get there attention, I can make the necessary casts to get us under control again (Trying to mezz %t, Tash on a ... ) you get the picture. <br /> <br />This isn't to say, that if I know the mission/quest or mobs we are gonna be fighting are extremely difficult, or not likely to have adds that will be a problem, I would definately want a warrior, or at least consider one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />My Main is a Warrior, so I try to find use of warrior's in every single circumstance I am in with an alt. The reason is I know how hard the warrior class has it comparebly...  <br /> <br />The Warrior's DPS is only significantly more when you get over 65th level and content. In mid and low level content, with the stuff you can pick up off non flagged and key'd area's far as gear, there isn't a really good reason to pick a Warrior for a group. I do it however, just to spite. I am picked for groups with my warrior alot, but only because everyone likes me. It's either that or they just find me amusing, not sure yet, but I really never have a problem getting a group. When I log onto my chanter though, or my cleric, for an example. Actually even my ranger, I get tells from people I don't know asking me to come group with them, or at least come and buff. Now, this isn't something that happens on my warrior, I never get these &quot;Heya, you interested in doing a DON?&quot;. I do on my son's SK, and I get them tons on my cleric, and I can't tell you how wanted a Chanter is in any type of group. Getting on my warrior, I only hear from those that I am on there friends list. </p>

<p>Yes, and the monk I ussually do them with believes in the &quot;Train them before they can train us&quot; Type of combat. That's not my point though, any type of grind group can have a bad pull or two, and if you never had one, it's not pretty when your not ready. Heck, that's why I am there on the chanter though, just in case of... I have never heard of anyone NEVER having a bad pull. Everyone wants to act superior, and yet this is a warrior forum. Monks FD can fail, just like a spell or a taunt. Even a level 70 monk with it maxed can FD and it fail, although unlikely, it CAN happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Instead of talking about how bad a puller someone is, try to look at the circumstance. IF this circumstance never occur's to you, then how can you comment? The situation and point was this: <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />If the monk comes back with 3 or 4 mobs, and even one resists me, I have one on me.

Maybe we wanted him too, maybe we didn't. The point is The monk pulling add's has nothing to do with the Point being made. It could be a monk, a Ranger, A necro, another chanter, whoever pulled brought back more then we were ready for. What class pulled has absolutely nothing to do with the knight being able to get the aggro off the chanter.. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Wed Jun 22 11:07:07 2005 by Anez</span></i></p>

<p>I don't disagree that paladins and Sks have some pretty good snap aggro. However, I've never once turned a warrior down as tank, because of it. If I had a group that could not handle 4 mobs in an ldon, and the monk pulled 4, I certainly would not blame the warrior for any deaths. <br /> <br />Additionally, in most groups, you'll have multiple ways to handle adds. Rangers can taunt a mob off, and have some really good snap aggro spells as well. Rogue/necro can short term mez, allowing the chanter another shot at mezzing. Druid, ranger, cleric and others can root the mob so you can back off it. Bard, well has lots of choices. <br /> <br />My whole point on the monk comment was this. If you group can easily handle four, then there is no reason not to pull four, but then there would be little reason to mezz them either. If your group can only handle 1-2 at a time, a monk should ALWAYS be able to get one or two in an ldon, using their pacify disc, and if that fails, feign it off. Yes, on the rare occasion, feign will fail, but a monk has several options to stay alive until feign repops. Mend, riposte disc, stonestance, etc... <br /> <br />Frankly, I usually PREFER a warrior, because if gear is equal, they wll have more hp, and will do greater dps, which means faster experience in a grind group. Of course, at my level, most warriors have AoE taunt, which means insta aggro, no matter how many resisted mezzes you had.</p>

You would probably ping pong with me all the way through the fight if I didnt watch myself. (I have even stolen aggro from my guilds usual raid tanks on accident on an occasion or two, and they have their 1.5s with hate augs. And yes, I do the smart thing and stop whacking the mob when that happens). If I stuck a hate aug into my epic, I would probably be able to keep aggro very effectivly over you. That being said, I would probably want you to tank over me becasue you have better mitigation and deeper HP than I do =p. <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />If any tank with taunt is playing close attention the first should almost never happen.

Also, pally stuns are probably at some point going to be tweaked to incrase their hate. For paladins to hold aggro well, especially in a group that isnt careful, requires chain stunning, something pallies usually are fond of as it isnt a lot of fun. This problem is known to the devs and community (even the paladin class correspondant is involved) so I suspect some changes in the near future. <br />The big problem us paldins are dealing with is that caster are generating more an more aggro as they get newer and more powerul spells. Warriors are getting new hate discs as the game progresses, so they keep up. Paladins, however, are stuck due to the cap on stun hate. This letter to the Devs from the pally correspondant sums it up nice: <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Hi Halflings and all, <br />  <br />It's been in our top ten list for a while, and there have been plenty of posts on the Paladin boards here and elsewhere, but I'd really like to ask for some feedback on what I, and I believe the majority of reasonably high-end Paladins, believe is the number one pressing issue for our class. <br />  <br />I'm talking about aggro. <br />  <br />Firstly, let me make it quite clear that I am not saying that Paladins cannot hold aggro at the moment.  We can.  We may need to chain cast three stuns to do so, but we can do it. <br />  <br />The big problem is that almost all Paladin aggro is generated by stuns, and the aggro component of stuns is, as we know, capped.  A level 70 Paladin with a full spellbook generates the same stun aggro as a level 50 Paladin in Karnors.  The high end guy is generating a little more in terms of pure DPS aggro, but hey, we're talking Paladins here - DPS is not our forte - and when we're trying to generate aggro we're casting not swinging, anyway. <br />  <br />Every other class is generating more and more aggro as expansions come and go.  Wizards are generating insane spell aggro.  Rogues and Monks generate far, far more aggro through their DPS as time goes by and their weaponry improves exponentially.  The other tank classes - quite rightly - generate more and more aggro to compensate for this, in terms of better disciplines and combat effects for Warriors, and better specific aggro spells for Shadow Knights.  Paladin aggro, however, remains static. <br />  <br />It was wrong that at level 40 a single stun in Dreadlands would generate enough aggro to lock the mob on a Paladin throughout a fight.  I am certainly not saying we should go back to that point.  Aggro should need to be worked at, sure.  However, we are now very close to the point - I believe it will happen in the next expansion - where Paladins genuinely cannot hold aggro against the DPS classes.  It's almost there now; if a Wizard in my guild starts on a mob at the same time as me, I am going to have to get a lucky taunt in order to get the aggro away from him before I've performed two full cycles of my three loaded stuns. <br />  <br />There are quite a lot of ways this could be addressed, but I don't want to get into methodologies right now; what I am keen to be told is that the developers do understand that this is a real and pressing issue, and how serious it would be if it were to go unfixed through another expansion. <br />  <br />Thanks.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />So who knows what is coming. <br />Ultimatley, all 3 classes can tank just fine at the present time. It is the groups responsibility to adjust their tactics to what the tank can do.</p>

<p>Oh, another point <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />The stun of a Pali is worth 400 or so hate points. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />This is not very accurate. The amount of hate generated by a stun at present is based on the max hp of the mob being stunned, subject to a cap (1300 according to one post I found, though this is unconfirmed). The cap is presently the big problem as it causes a lvl 70 paladin in MPG or RS to generate the same aggro as a lvl 50 paladin in KC. I suspect the cap is left over from over from the days before PoP and the like when they wanted to keep pally stun aggro from getting to trong. Now, unfortunatley, its causing its usefulness to drop off. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Thu Jun 23 16:01:45 2005 by dfrnchman</span></i></p>

There are also other offensive AAs that can figure in. <br />It also would be intersting if the paldin in question in your example had put a hate aug in his weapon. I bet he didnt have one and it could of made a huge difference. 3 levels by themselves dont make a huge differnce, but 3 levels plus a couple hundred AAs can make a differance in a hurry. <br />Also, from one of your earlier posts: <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Number of Warrior Procs = Number of knight proc + 2.

<p>The intent of this post was to determine the role of a warrior in a group. Their biggest job is and probably always will be to Tank the mob. I seen many complain about DPS, instead of work on holding aggro. If you have no problem holding aggro, then probably this thread was boring to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Somehow we lost base on the topic. I am as guilty as anyone, as my head is just as hard. If we continue this thread though, let's talk about the role of the warrior, not the whole taunt vs. knight vs. aggro/hate, etc.  <br /> <br />I have seen, played with, and tried to reason with other warrior's all upset cuz that level 60 monk is hitting more and harder then their level 65 warrior. I say, worry about keeping the mobs attention, once that becomes unnecessary, then you can upgrade your DPS through whatever means are available (Aug's, AA's, New Weapon, etc.).</p>

<p>I have been playing EQ for about 4 years now and in the beginning wars were suppose to be able to deal out as much damage as they were taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now everyone thinks they are just suppose to be a meatshield and that is it and dps dont matter for them.  I still think that a war should be able to put out as much damage as they can take and as long as SOE keeps screwing us it will never happen other classes will always be ahead of us completely.  I play a 68 war and cant even come close to outdamaging a pali or sk with melee combat much less when they are casting spells and they can get a blade of disruption for about 5kp in the bazaar.  I have yet to see a weapon for a war that can be purchased in the bazaar that is even compairable to that.  Sure we can duel weild but 16 dam. 20 delay in both hands dont even compare to the weapons they are able to get and having more dps does create more aggro by far I have seen it enough times when being grouped with monks rogues and rangers.  They need to reinvision the war class and fix alot of these problems in my opinion and quit saying they are going to reinvision all the classes and keep leaving us out of it.</p>

<p>If you cant out damage a knight with a Blade of Disruption, either: <br /> <br />1) The knight has a huge AA/level advantage on you <br />2) The knight has a signifcant gaer advantage on you <br />3) You are doing something wrong. <br /> <br />With the exception of myself, all the knight mains in my guild have the BoD. We are an EP level guld to put things into perspective. The BoD has a DPS somewhere between 45-60 on average. A 65+ warrior should be able to be well past that. The warriors in my guild, by comparison DPS around 105-130 on avaerage with the same gear level. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the BoD is a great weapon, but its not about DPS, its about stunning for aggro purposes, i.e. its a tanking weapon.</p>

<p>The Bod was a much needed weapon for knights. Knights in EQ are specialty knights, Paladons and Shadowknights more in toon with their gods, then say a normal Cavalier of olden days, where they march in the field of battle on a horse. I think that weapon is a wonderful tool for knights, I think a Knight deserves there excaliber. Especially after level 60 has been achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

According to all the therios on hate generation, the amount of hate generated by a weapon is related to the damage of the same weapon.  Now compair the avg hit or the dps of the EoE vs the avg hit or the dps of the DoB.  It isn't even close.   <br /> <br />And now remember the damage bonus was increassed for two handed weapon to make the more competative with using two one handed weapons.  <br /> <br />Yes it is true that Knights can get uber ratio weapons for almost  nothing...but then it is also true that Knights need those weapons.  </p>

However, knights generally prefer (with exceptions) the 1h/shield combo for some very good reasons. The biggest is increased defenseive stats. Our mitigation being weaker than a warrior, we rely on gear for defense A LOT more.  <br />Yes, we lose DPS using a 1H, but our DPS is already in the basement, so losing a little more wont hurt. DPS is a minor consideration in controlling aggro for a paladin, especially against mobs who are lvl 55+. There our stuns can generate huge aggro, at least until we start bumping up against the stun/hate cap. Then our abilites to generate hate level off fast.  <br />Warriors also get more hate out of 1hers, becasue of dual wield. Again, DPS is a secondary source of aggro generation. By dual wielding, they can get far more procs than they will with a single 2 hander.</p>

<p>To answer something earlier in the post about snap aggro. It was said that a warrior's taunt is better then a Knight's taunt, so a warrior's snap aggro should be better...&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />To me this suggests that a Knight is actually gonna use taunt to get the aggro instead of a hate spell (SK) or stun (Pally).?! <br /> <br />Is this actually what happens in group situations? Do Knights that lose aggro, use taunt to get it back most the time? <br /> <br />Call me a newbie if you want, but If I were a Pally, stun would be hit ASAP, and is a pretty darn fast cast. On stunnable mobs (There are plenty) it actually stops them in their tracks. Also, the fact that a successful taunt doesn't always ensure a successful aggro, and definately pushing the taunt button does not insure that taunt would work. I may be wrong, but I believe a Pally stun with applicable ability maxed would work more often then a taunt maxed in ability.  <br /> <br />I use duel weild when grouping right now, a BoC and a Copper hammer of striking. It's a good combo for me, as I don't have the funds to get better right now. The BOC dropped while Raiding Keal, otherwise I wouldn't have that weapon. <br /> <br />DPS has always been last considered to me, far as choosing a weapon. I always wanted the weapon to hold aggro more so then deal damage. Lately however I been feeling like maybe it's not such a bad Idea for Warrior's to get a good push in the DPS department. DpS could actually help a Warrior solo as well (What??? A Warrior solo, NOOO WAY!!!), and I mean something other than lt blue mobs. I mean something that will amount to some good experience (With maybe the aid of the new Heal spells, WOOT!). I expect Warrior's to solo the worse of all classes, but I would like us to solo better then we can now. This would allow for grinding AA's without having to worry about getting anyone else killed...LOL. <br /> <br />I just don't see things the same way as Warrior Joe. I am not even sure if we are playing the same game. In the game I play, most Knights are pretty close to the same DPS as I am when tanking, and ussually out DPS me if they are not tanking. The difference between tanking a mob and not tanking dps wise for me seems very small. I think Necrophobe was onto something with the solo utility tool question he put on the Warrior boards.  <br /> <br />And as far as mitigation is concerned, the only time I see a good difference between myself and a equal knight in gear lvl, is when it's against a Mob that requires the use of my defensive disc. The refresh on the discs I use (Not sure if it's the same for Warrior Joe or not) is way too long to be usefull in any group content outside of maybe a named every twenty to thirty mobs. I think our handling of normal mobs in group content should be pretty equal though, the difference I have in opinion is as to how. I think a Knight to achieve equal tanking in a group as a warrior does should have to use all their abilities to do it. I do not mean they should have to cast 15 spells per mob, but I think they should have to cast in order to keep up, and not just stun, lifetap, hate, but a good variety. I think they should be able to last though, in other words, not have to drain their mana pool dry doing it, but have to use it efficiently.</p>

<p>When I am playing my pally, I always taunt before hitting stun. It only takes a fraction of a second to hit both hotkeys, instead of one, and if taunt works, then the stun helps boost me farther up ahead of the group the hatelist, rather than having to stun just to catch up. If the taunt fails, then I just hit my second stun, as soon as the spell gems refresh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>I dissagree that a Warrior has no trouble getting aggro. I aggree that with a group that helps the Warrior get aggro, they won't have any trouble. Without the group working with the warrior, like say, acting like they are with a Knight, then the warrior will have a terrible time keeping aggro. I don't dissagree with your point, I dissagree that the statement involves someone being stupid for a warrior to have a problem with aggro. </p>

<p>I aggree with you except for 1 thing you shouldnt have issues keeping aggro the prob is most warriors out there are not learning the class. granted if a wizzy really wants aggro ( they dont they squishy) they will take it and die. but your not sopose to beable to keep aggro off a wizard burning a full mana bar on a mob thats how it is. Whats really sad is when i was lvl 59 i didnt realize there was any more aggro discs for me out there till i was 61 but when i was 59 i was using provoke a lvl like 30 some odd anger disc that and a pair of cheap weps (1hb ( Copper hammer of strikeing and 1hs Sword of bloodsworn very common combo) any how i tested if he could hold aggro off me if i did provoke taunt and attack after it was to 75% , of coarse i thought he was gonna win had uber weps and some serious discs, and as if irony slapped me in the face i got aggro off him when the mob was 70% . Why? how? Am i just hiding something from you? HECK NO i just knew my class and played it right. This is why i hate most twinks. ( not all are that bad but a lot are)</p>

Warrior's build their aggro, and the use of taunt combined with berate line disc can be very usefull in pulling aggro off another... The problem warrior's have with aggro is at the very start of the fight, not after they have built their aggro up. <br /> <br />Let's say Tim, a 65 pally, taunts, then stuns the mob on incoming, he has instant aggro, weather taunt was successfull or not, another stun ussually insures that aggro, and it is practiced that the debuffer/slower is going to slow the mob on incoming as well. The mob has been slowed, and aggro established before any real engagement of the mob has been made. Now, Tim is getting creamed by the mob, and the Warrior isn't afk no more, the mob is at (picking a % out of the wind) 60%, and the Warrior hits Taunt, then hits berate... IF the taunt is successfull, it will put the warrior's hate above Tim's, and the berate will work like a dot, adding to the hate over a period of time. A warrior can take aggro off just about anyone doing this, if everything works right,and the pally isn't doing anything more to get aggro.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Role reverse is the Warrior Taunting and using berate at incoming, even if taunt works and berate has been hit, that slower can still end up with the mob on them, and anything else that slower does to the mob (root, etc.) will increase the hate to the slower, and make it even harder for the WArrior to get aggro. If the slower takes no action, while the warrior is beating on it, and hitting Taunt, and letting his berate line work, it can go either way. The taunt if successful will give the warrior aggro, and everything is fine. IF unsuccessful, then the warrior is going to rely on his dps, aug's, combined with the berate working it's hate over time on it, till he has aggro. NOw, let's say we go through this a couple of times, and the slower is on the verge of dieing from every pull. Tim (the pally) see's this, and decide's a stun when the mob runs to the slower would surely help keep that mob from doing too much damage to the slower.  <br /> <br />A good grind group is gonna do more then 40 mobs an hour (just over a mob a minute) and that fast aggro is needed. A warrior's aggro builds, as &quot;most&quot; know, so getting the aggro on incoming, and keeping it requires the whole group to hold off while the warrior establishes it (aggro). This will bring the kills down in number, with DPS unable to go to work (Yes, DPS is what makes the mobs die faster) as soon. IF all aug's the warrior has in his weapons, and taunt, and berate are all activated on incoming, then Yes, a Warrior won't have aggro issue's. IF one of them fail's to activate (Taunt or Aug's), then the aggro is takes longer to establish. Understand that I mean aggro that is gonna keep the mob on the warrior while the rogue is backstabbing, the debuffer is slowing, and the nuker's can nuke. <br /> <br />Snap aggro &gt; built aggro, for your serious grind groups. That's why a Knight is more desirable, for the most part. Gating mobs, running mobs, etc, are all other reason's, but that snap aggro really makes a difference, and can mean up to 10 mobs or more an hour per grind period. </p>

<p>What is Draco's class? <br /> <br />Trust me, a knight's taunt is not much different then a Warrior's, reguardless of old belief's. It has already been none that Taunt is only a bit stronger for a warrior, and that's only in that &quot;top of the line, pluss a tad&quot; area. The success rate is identical. <br /> <br />Meaning, if Draco has a taunt button, and hit a successfull, he just ended up with all the hate that warrior had, pluss a tad more. The warrior will have to use his Discs, Dps, Aug's, and taunt again, to get it back. If Draco continue's to build up hate, by stuns, or whatever, he will be able to keep it. If the Warrior has a successfull taunt however, you will find the mob ping ponging back and forth everytime you get succesful taunts. <br /> <br />Help any? <br /></p>

<p>My belief is that taunt has a Maximum... Say 1200 hate max, or more, depending on how much hate has been generated before you taunt. I've been around some great DPS class's, that taunt don't even seem to effect the mob at all, the mob just stays on the monk no matter what I do. Necrophobe had an idea about that, and I can't help but to maybe aggree, the monk was just creating so much hate through DPS, that by the time ( 1 tick? ) it would take the mob to look at me after a successfull taunt, the monk had created so much hate that it didn't even look at me. <br /> <br />I have always tended to believe that taunt does stack, and won't hurt you if you have two successfulls in a row, especially if it gives you top of the list, pluss a tad, you would only be putting yourself on top of yourself if your the most hated, but still would bring you higher. Exactly how taunt works hasn't really been decided, even on places like the Steel Warrior, there is to much room for mistakes or other variable's to be the reason for the outcome. In either case, I aggree, having a successfull taunt does not insure you the top of the list in hate everytime. My guess is it has a limit, like other's have said. Kind of like when you fall for 32000 damage, or whatever. IF their is more aggro over what your taunt's max is, then you will have to do more taunts successfully to get that aggro back. Fortunately, it's mainly the very highest of the DPS that this happens with, at lower levels its not as noticeable.</p>

<p>&quot;a key word in there being &quot;successful&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />one problem is that taunt fails  <br />even at max skill, you get those stupid little red messages that says you didn't piss off the mob&quot; <br /> <br />Yeah, and it seems like it happens just as much no matter how much in skill you go up. I was talking about that other little message though, something like &quot;You have succesfully.... &quot; <br /> <br />It's not something that happens in every group, but I have seen it quite often and regularly around certain people I group with. The successful taunt not actually turning the mob.</p>

<p>Is it just me, or when facing red and yellow con mobs does taunt fail more often? My 52 warrior in a 52-60 LDoN (high risk, Takish-Hiz) had one hell of a time holding down agro and ended up doing a lot of chasing mobs rather than tanking mobs. <br /> <br />-Taunt failed more than once per three tries. <br />-A successful taunt failed to get me agro at least twice. <br />-Druids were pulling agro with dots. <br />-Ranger was pulling agro with snare. <br />-Cleric was pulling agro only when adds came. <br />-I was unable to take back agro after a successful taunt followed by bellow (or whichever the 52 provoke is) from the chanter after a mez, tash, and slow (chanter was 58 using Forlorn Deeds, hence 68% slow). <br /> <br />I found that I was getting more benefit from the use of /shield than I was of taunt. My Zek Crested Buckler with Furious Bash II (+20% bash hate AFAIK) was being swapped in to bash and back out via bandolier macro (I can only assume this is giving me stun hate +20%), I was dual wielding a soulpiercer and a split blade of destruction, with a 50dd aug attached to the soulpiercer which was in main hand. I had the chanter haste and cast the agro buff on me (Horrifying Visage, +10% to agro multiplier) on inc, before I would use bellow and I was trying to taunt after slow landed, unless someone else stole agro first. <br /> <br />All in all this was a really bad experience, and I found myself apologizing for my trouble holding agro with anything that moved in that LDoN, and I had several opportunities to see taunt fail to get me agro in one way or another. <br /> <br />So what I am asking is for you to point ot where I am going wrong if something is obvious, and confirm whether or not taunt works better against lower level mobs. Also, I'd be more than happy to hear any details about exactly what taunt does.</p>

<p>All righty Intcasta. <br /> <br />Lets see what taunt does.. <br /> <br />First of all , what I like the most about EQ and why I think no game will ever top it is.. the `Artificial Intelligence (AI)`of the monsters you are fighting .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />It really looks like the mobs are `smart` and they respond diferently to every action the players in the group do . <br />It is the #1 reason why these online games are so popular and adictive. <br />How did the SoE programers achieve this ? <br />Well...most of the time you hear about this so called Hate List of a mob Right ? <br />The Hate list does exist and it`s in the `mind`of the mob. <br />Every action that players do towards the mob has hate points that STACK in the `mind` of a mob .  <br />Casters build hate with casting spells , Melee classes build hate with hiting the mob + other tools like discs , procs etc. <br />Mob will turn on the player that he `hates` the most and start whacking him at any given time in the fight .  <br /> <br />Now.. what produces most hate ? <br /> <br />SoE will never give clear answer on this and players have to figure out on their own how the mobs react thru years of experiance and thats how it should be to keep the game interesting .  <br /> <br />The most `hatefull` spells are Stun , Slow , Snare , nukes , Tash  <br />etc.. maybe not in that order exactly but close. <br /> <br />Melee generated hate is rather much more complicated than fixed hate that spells produce and involves 2 most important things: <br />1. How fast you swing your weps..lets call it `swing hate` <br />2. How much damage you do with your weapons.. `dps hate`  <br /> <br />Now back to taunt.  <br />Every time you taunt successfuly mobs puts you on top of that hate list..some say taunt = top+1 , some say top+10 , it doesnt really mater , what mater is..after taunt you see your name in Hott window = you have aggro at that point in the fight. <br />Dont listen to the crap some other people have been saying about taunt in this thread hehe Taunt DOES NOT have fixed value of hate and taunt DOES NOT builds up hate , purpose of Taunt is to put you on top of the hate list..thats it. <br />You might lose aggro 1 sec after taunt for whatever reason but.. <br />If you are close enough to the mob ( very important and goes without saying ) and taunt doesn`t fail you got aggro on the mob. <br /> <br />So.. the Taunt is the most powerfull aggro tool in the game and if it doesn`t fail Warrior would never lose aggro and the game would be unbalanced and boring .  <br /> <br />There are 3 cases when Taunt doesn`t work. <br />1. Taunt fails - ( you get red text message ) <br />2. You are too far from the mob - (you get red text message) <br />3. Low HP aggro - ( 1 or more players in your group are on -20% or -25% health not sure where the LowHP border was , which results in all mobs around charging at that player to finish him off..nothing helps there and you dont get any text messages other than whining player from bind spot :)  ) <br /> <br />VERY IMPORTANT : Area Taunt AA NEVER fails , however it doesnt work against LowHP aggro. <br />Downside of Area Taunt is the 15 min refresh which you can cut down to 10 min with AAs but needless to say.. get that AA ASAP. <br /> <br />Now about taunting yellow and red mobs. <br />My understanding of taunt ( if it fails or not ) is totaly random with fixed % on success /fail .  <br />However , I have noticed that sometimes it looks like some mobs are harder to taunt ( first thing that comes to mind are the adds that spawn in the King Gelaqua event in RSS ) I allways have trouble taunting these mobs , maybe it`s just coincidence maybe not...who knows. <br /> <br /> <br />The main and most important tool that never fails for Warrior to keep aggro on the mob is hes Dps aggro. <br />Bonuses are the taunt ( that can fail few times in a row ) <br />and the procs on the weapons ( that also might not hapen in whole fight sometimes , depending on many factors such as proc rate on weapons , your Dex , AAs ,  etc ) <br /> <br />If the melee classes in your group have beter ratio weapons than you and your taunt fail and you dont get proc early ...you will lose aggro. <br />If mob stuns you on inc with first hit..which they usualy do ( unless you are an Ogre ) ...you will lose aggro . <br />If casters cast crap on incoming mob before you ever hit it you wont lose aggro becouse you never had it in first place . <br />So... Aggro menagment is a team play , You holding aggro depends a lot of the members of your group too . <br /> <br /> <br />Now back to your LDoN problem. <br /> <br />I see clearly where the problem is and it`s..your weapons. <br />Your weapons have good dps value , however they are Lvl recomeneded and you beeing lvl 52 you dont get the full dmg benefit from those weapons atm. <br />You are coming to a point when you need procs to boost your aggro. Best procs are Raw Hate procs , followed by stun procs. <br />You need to get the `Droga combo` asap. <br />That`s Sword of the Bloodsworn + Copper Hammer of Striking . <br />They both have stun component in the procs and they shouldn`t be a problem for you to get. <br />It`s pretty much the most popular Warrior combo in the game up untiel lvl 60+ and will boost your aggro a lot. <br /> <br />The Best Aggro weapon for Warrior that is bazar buyable is Blade of Carnage. <br /> It`s 15/20 with 700 raw hate proc ,no lvl rec and starts procing on lvl 40 . <br />I can`t put it in words how important this sword is for any serious warrior. It`s 1 of..or maybe the only item in the game that you could equip on lvl 1 and it will still serve you well on lvl 70 . Dowside of it is.. it`s very expensive hehe. <br />So first priority of any Warrior should be geting this weapon , starting at lvl 1. Do whatever it takes , Farm your ass off , resell items in bazaar for a month if necessary , save all your plat and BUY it.  <br /> <br />The other reasons why you had aggro problems in that partticular LDoN adventure are very obvious also. <br /> <br />1. There were players in the group that were much higher lvl than you. That means the casters were casting higher lvl spells which produce more hate that you can = they outaggro you. <br /> <br />2. Melee types or hybrids , in your case Ranger , was maybe higher lvl than you or was meleeing with beter ratio weps than you + snare + rangers have very high atack usualy = outaggroing you. <br /> <br />3. You were tanking Red mobs = they have much higher AC and skills like dodge and parry then Blue mobs = your dps was much lower than against blue mobs. <br /> <br />4. When you say even successful taunt wasnt giving you aggro = not true . Most likely what hapend was.. you were too far from the mob when you were taunting becouse of the chase around the room hehe , or , you had aggro after taunt but lost it again very next second. It`s easy to see that if the group leader had Hott ability and you had Hott window open on your screen. <br /> <br />  <br /> With other words.. you found out the hard way that Warrior tanking is hardest job in town and Warriors lvl up slower than other classes becouse for Warrior to be successful in holding aggro in XP group pretty much means he has to be highest or at least same lvl as the others + best equiped , at least in the weapon department. <br /> <br />Hope this post helps  :) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Tue Sep  6 07:48:19 2005 by Warlork</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Tue Sep  6 07:56:53 2005 by Warlork</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Tue Sep  6 10:04:45 2005 by Warlork</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Tue Sep  6 10:13:08 2005 by Warlork</span></i></p>

<p>Hello all <br /> <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;  Dormak Fearnoevil (Order of the Anciant Dragon) Saryn Server lvl 70 Guild MT.(most of the time) <br /> <br />     Just wanted to take part in this discussion.  The Thread was started on DPS and that is what I would like to respond too.  My dps has never been that great untill I got the Duel wield aa, and the Gates aa that alows more damage to be done with the off hand weapon.  With a few flurry aa's to boot I would say I can do some serious Steady dps.  200-400 damage a second is pretty damn good in my book, though it really means nothing to a raid mob, or some of the trash mobs in The Nest or RS, I honestly can't complane about the dps I do, and actually wondering how much more will it be once I have the 1.5.  As far as this aggro, taunt, pally, sk discussion that has been around for a while.  I clearly remember the pains comeing up from 50-65.  Early PoP, I pally or Sk was the class to have, once we got incite I think the Warrior Class once again began to shine.  The only trouble I really have now is Wizards nukeing to early, or the mob getting hit before I can get to it.  The only time a chanter in my group takes a hit is if before I can incite and taunt (takes both usually) while a mob is mezzed, and my taunt fails so I wait and someone else hits it, It all revolves around everyone being able to play there class.  I have tanked in RS a few times for example, but at only 8.4k unbuffed it takes a solid GROUP to keep me up, not just a good cleric.  More often than not I end up being the weak link in the group and I will get a better replacement for that group.  Why because I know how to play my class and what I need to do my job.  I love being a warrior and can't think of a more entertaining class to play.  just my 2pp</p>

<p>Aggro is hard to quantify.. Taunt is a tricky subject. It does fail more on white and above cons than it does on blue and below. Just as any skill does. A succesful taunt moves you to top of the hate list +1. So if you get a succesful taunt and follow it up with the incite line for your level you generally be good on aggro for that part. ... <br /> <br />Second if your a warrior you are 100% dependent on gear to survive and maintain aggro. The Droga combo is great for warriors in their 50s-60s depending on how much you raid.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stun procs are roughly 500 hate give or take a bit. And those procs will give you a large part of your aggro.  If your a poor warrior you can pick up a barnacle covered axe with a hate proc built in in dulak on one of the boats or for 50-100 plat in the bazaar. Other cheap options at the 50s range is the greatstaff of thunder which on my server sells cheap in the 100 plat range. Its a 2 hand blunt so it cuts down on riposte and has a stun proc built in that rocks. Weapons that have proc will hold aggro better than your higher ratio non procing weapons most of the time and that should be enough to get you through to 65 and the DoN adventures where you can pick up some awesome stuff. <br /> <br />Drathos <br />The Rathe</p>

<p>Wasnt posted on the SK board (sob).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />While I have to say pallies do in fact have their uses, it utterly disgusts me when a pally wants to be main tank. They can get snap agro from puller sure, but overall cant hold it anywhere near as much as a warrior. Their DPS severely lacks to that of the gimpest 70 warrior I have yet seen even if pally is Time geared and warrior only has gimp named OoW gear.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Warriors can hold agro, as can pally's.  Pally's do not achieve agro lock through sustained DPS however.  As a nuker, you have probably been in the position where you have pulled agro from the MT.  Knowing what to do and when is important in raids (I am aware you know this already).  There are situations that call for hybrids to offtank (which pally's excel at with DA and all).  Personally, I have seen pally's have more problems with Damage spikes then holding agro (as long as the DPS classes announce a burn).  But thats just me.  I get jittery if a Pally is MTing against a stun resistant mob (because I know I'm next to eat the mob in most cases). <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Wed Oct 19 16:52:13 2005 by Necrophobe</span></i></p>
