<p>seen a few people posting things about how they get aggro but notice they are just using disc not adding taunt into there aggroing. People Warriors canuse taunt and discs together you dont just have to use incite or bellow you can use taunt too. now i understand why i see so many warriors being yelled at about aggro from casters these last few weeks <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Taunt is supposed to put you on the top of the hate list. After taunting the first time, most of the higher level warrior's use incite/berate line to hold aggro. These discs work as a kind of aggro over time, like a dot. Taunting if the caster gets aggro, with a successful taunt can bring you back to the top of the hate list, getting it off the caster.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />If the caster's are overnuking, or over casting on the mob, without the addition of augmented weapons, combined with disc, the warrior won't be able to hold aggro... Will have a hard time anyways if caster's are over nuking period. <br /> <br />We had a big debate on weather or not to use taunt while battling, and if it actually helps. MOst believe that it's at best, left to use if you do lose aggro, hoping for a successful snap aggro from it. Taunt on incoming, incite, then taunt if you lose aggro.  <br /> <br />Aggro on a warrior is built over time, unlike say a Pally's stun, which is snap aggro. Most the time a stun can keep the mob at bay for 30 seconds, which is ussually the lifespan, if that of the mob. Warrior's cannot do snap aggro at all, and the use of taunt puts a warrior &quot;Just a tad&quot; above the rest of the hate from other people in the group. Incite/berate is the only real aggro machine Warrior's have,outside of proc's and augments. Taunt cannot keep the mob on the warrior for an extended period of time, and sometimes even when successfull, the dps is so good in the group, that the mob don't even look the warrior's way, cuz the aggro has already been overiddin by dps. Most warrior's at higher levels never just mash the taunt button each time it appears, although there is debate on weather it hurts or not to do it. <br /> <br />You have to adapt with your tanks, a Warrior without the proper aug's, and just using taunt and discs won't be able to &quot;build&quot; much aggro right away, let them work on the mob a bit before jumpin' in. </p>

<p>&quot;For normal groups I believe mobs last closer to 60 seconds.&quot; <br /> <br />Word of advice, let the knight tank them, you will double the mobs your killing in serious grinds.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Your having to wait a minute per kill is probably the reason you have no trouble on aggro as well, they let you establish it, holding back cuz your a Warrior. With a Knight, their's no need to wait, I have seen mobs get nuked, rogue's backstab, and Monk's land ton's of blows, all the while with the shammy slowing, etc. The mob don't even look their way, and the knight hasn't even hit it yet. Just casting their stun's, and or hate spells, and the mob moves right to them, half the time down below 90% before they even start effectively hitting the mob. <br /> <br />There is no reason a group of level 65+ toons cannot kill a mob every 30 seconds. Heck, in Ldon's we go through twice as fast.  <br /> <br />Your not playing with high enough DPS class's to even begin to understand the problems a Warrior has with Aggro. Although, I can fully understand where your coming from now, your posts have nothing in them for me at all, if this is the case. Your not in the same position, so your point is mute in reguards to what I am talking about. <br /> <br />A Pally Stunning a mob on the pull, and again as it hits camp, establishes a great amount of hate. The option the Pally has if the mob looks at someone else, simply, Cast stun again. A Warrior cannot depend on a Proc off a weapon to land just when they need, and a mob moving like the one's I'm around, is going to be out of range of taunt, as soon as you see them move. You will have to run over their and taunt it while hitting (Hoping for a proc), and that's just not enough to save the person getting whomped on sometimes. A stun will save them. <br /> <br />Most content in the game (Probably well over 90%) is stunnable content. Just a note, to keep anyone from even going that route. <br /> <br />I don't believe that Warrior's are a broken class, I also believe other class's have just as many problems. <br /> <br />Their have been some great changes in our Knightly tanking cousins, however, that have let us fall behind in utility, desirability, and in particular, a place to use our only advantage (mitigation, defensive-although knights do have a gimp form of defensive now). A warrior is not needed for any single group content, a Knight in the same gear can tank it just as effectively, actually, as I look at some parces, sometimes actually tanking tons' better then a warrior.  <br /> <br /> <br /></p>

Could it be that fights in normal group last only 30 seconds? <br />Well it is possible, So i decied to check it out.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />As normally happens i got an invite to do a creator shortly after going lfg.  Oh by the way i was in  EF and there was a lvl 70 palie lfging in Lava... <br />Any way the group look normal to me, had the beast and a wiz so no real lack of dps, so I decided to time how long mobs lived.  The avg mob lasted between 45 and 60 seconds.  Only two were less than 45 seconds, but then there were two that were longer than 60 seconds.  The group seemed to complete the mission in about normal time.   <br />So in short in a normal group mobs do last closer to 60 seconds than 30 seconeds.  Since 45 is the half way point and most mobs lived longer than 45 seconds.   <br />This life spane is about avg...based on how often the mob last longer than the bellows line abilities.  As for other classes holding back I've never known beast, monks, rogues etc to hold back regardless of what class the tank is.  And as I have stated many time, warriors generate more hate during a fight therefore the dps classes can do more damage during a fight if a warrior is MT.   <br />These days snap aggor at the start of a fight only maters to chanter who slow...and with all the beast and shasman running around, who needs a chanter to slow? <br /> <br />So it is possible that old Joe could slip up... but not this tine <br /> :) <br /> <br />As for the rest of the clames, I can only assume they are equily well based on facts...and therefor not wroth responding to.</p>

<p>No, your not slipping. With the setup you had, and what your fighting &quot;creator&quot; I would imagine you come to the only conclusion you could come to. I will keep doing them at 30 seconds avg, and you will keep killing at 60 seconds average.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />My berate is almost always still unrefreshed by the time the second mob is almost dead, we ussually chain pull, and the puller is already killing the second mob while the first one is about to die. Your conclusion is built around the way you play, you might not chain pull, or you might not actually engage till your incite button is refreshed, I don't know. When we are grinding, serious grinds, we do even faster then 30 seconds a kill at times. The pace is between 40 to 60 mobs an hour, and when your doing it like that, the time in between is just awaiting respawns, as mobs get kind of sparce as time goes on. Sometimes moving to a new area will ensure they keep killing, although we ussually just wait for respawns.</p>

A successful for either does the same thing. Incite works like a dot, doing aggro over time.

<p>Knights will always be welcome in my groups the point is warriors arent useless but due to all your spells whats the point of a warrior when the pally out aggros and has just as many hps?........ none its frustrating knowing that whenever i am gonna go lfg agianst a pally or sk with same hps/ac and lvl im gonna get the back hand a be sitting another 20 min for a group...... im sorry but Warriors Job is tanking not dmg not healing not pets we have that job and we should be the best at it becuase its nearly the only thing we can do in groups..... pallies should not be nerfed in anyway but we need to get some better aggro or better hp ac ...... if we dont have better in one or 2 of those things we will always be second in groups.. just last night i was uninvited from a group becuase the leader doesnt like how well wars hold aggro i hadnt even been given a chance to pull 1 mob before they said he didnt want me and got a SK im sorry but that ticks me off that i cant even be allowed to do the job i was designed for it the knights take group ........... im done with this forum im starting to sound like all the other pissed off crying warriors here im gonna play the game and enjoy it later</p>

And just for your information when LDoN came out the avg group had the same avg kill time as they do now in DoN missions, which is between 45 and 60 seconds.   <br />So you go right on killing mobs at a 30 second per mob and at some point you will gain enough leveles that the mobs will catch up with your gear and your kill rate will drop to that of every other normal group.   <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Actually, a stun + successful taunt of a pally &gt; two low delay duel wields taunt maxed and incite.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />B.S. and if that isn't clear enough No way in Hell.   <br />I've proven that warriors using avg hate weapons and avg hate procs can shortly make up any hate gab generated by stun.

Furthermore when group with a knight with planer equipment, and my warrior using dps weapons it is not uncommon for the warrior to take aggro at sum point in the fight. <br />If you dobubt this then explane why the developers have given knights signifent bazaar grade weapons improvements (better dps and high hate procs) in the past few expanctions, and no real imporvement of the warriors hate generating ability...the answer is smiple Knights needed the help.   <br /> <br />Now for a sub lvl 50 pali I'm sure life is very much like you descripe it.  Yes Stun is a huge hate advantage at those levels, and warriors don't really have many good aggro weapons and hate procs.  But once you level up life will change for you. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" /> Incite will allow you to out aggro over time, but if the pally stuns again... <br /><hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />WRONG <br />Warriors out aggor over time with only their dps advantage and higher number of procs.  Warriors don't need incite or hate procs to generate more hate per round than Palies. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" /> Incite works like a dot, doing aggro over time. <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />Well you are half right, but there is an instant hate aspect to incite as well.  Pushing insite alone almost always results in taking aggro from the puller.  Yes the snap aggor of stun is greater than the snap aggor of incite but incite dose have an instant hate component....something most higher lvl warriors know... <br /> <br />Now I'm sure you are going to clame you are a high lvl warrior...but your posts and game knowlage suggest other wise.</p>

Level 70 means you probably have an AA advantage. Also, what are the gear levels. &quot;Planar gear&quot; can be a WIDE range of things. Also, if the pally was loosing aggro at 90%, he was either very poorly geared compared to you and/or didn't know what he was doing. Even with a huge gear advantage on your part, he should have been able to hold aggro longer than that. <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />WRONG  <br />Warriors out aggor over time with only their dps advantage and higher number of procs. Warriors don't need incite or hate procs to generate more hate per round than Pallies. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br />Ummm, no. If both warrior and paladin are both JUST using melee, then yes, the warrior is going to out aggro. Pointless, however, as no one fights that way unless they are complete idiots. <br />If both the warrior and the pally are doing their best to maintain aggro, and if we ignore the wildcard that taunt cant be, the pally will usually generate more assuming equivilently geared/AA'd toons. The only exception is if you are fighting Anguish/MPG trial level encounters. Pallies cant hold aggro very well there at full chain stunning as the DPS levels for toons of that range is HUGE, and paladin stuns have not kept up as they smack into the stun hate cap (around 1300 for cast stuns, 400 for procs). Outside of those high end enviornments, however, paladins usually have the edge in aggro. Warriors, however, have the mitigation/AC/hp advantage. <br /></p>

<p>i Currently play a 66 warrior and due to my maxed taunt incite and my 20 delay or less weps with 16 dmg and at least a 50 point proc i can out aggro a pally of same level no matter what his gear is. the only hybrids i found the most difficulty over aggro is Bst or SK im sorry yes pally can do great aggro however if a stunning pally useing taunt and better aa and gear tries to get aggro i will hold it for the most part (of coarse many other things can happen were he grabs aggro or looses it) either way warriors are better aggro however we loose the ability to self heal so all in all if you want to heal self and do good aggro by all means play a pally but if want to avoid spells work discs and have almost every weapon skill known in game (2hP exculded) Play a warrior personally i love my warrior no queastion pallies are great and all but the thought of needing a shield to bash drives me nuts ..... ill take my barbarian warrior ......... Still pallies if need a group give me a call your always welcome</p>

This don't change the fact that it's ussually not refreshed by the time we are on the next mob... ? What's that got to do with what I said though?  <br /> <br />&quot;I've proven that warriors using avg hate weapons and avg hate procs can shortly make up any hate gab generated by stun. As you might recall the warrior took aggro frequently with the mob having 90% life left. Sure the warrior was 3 lvls higher but then the amount of hate generated by stun isn't lvl dependend. Furthermore when group with a knight with planer equipment, and my warrior using dps weapons it is not uncommon for the warrior to take aggro at sum point in the fight.&quot; <br /> <br />I dissagreed with your test, till more data is provided. I really want you to be right, just don't think your letting us in on enough information to be able to take this as fact. <br /> <br />&quot;all i got to say is hes right Taunt stacks with incite and bellow so when i play war i us both the incite come back fast taunt does to so i use both at same time rather have over aggro then not enough ya know?&quot; <br /> <br />I understand this statement, and totally aggree with the poster. I could be like other poster's and point out an obvious way I could missinterpret it, and say, Berate and INcite cannot be used together, since they are on the same refresh line, however, it's obvious the poster meant, either, or.  <br /> <br />The biggest debate is &quot;To Mash taunt everytime it pops,or not?&quot; I think Taunt stacks, so it's no biggie if you do. Other's think you could possibly lose aggro... That never made scense to me though. WJ Likes to keep it refreshed as an &quot;Uh Oh&quot; use, just in case aggro is lost, to have a fast way to get it back.  <br /> <br />Taunt's been maxed on my toon since I can remember, and I seem to only get a successfull maybe 70% of the time, sometimes as low as 60%. I don't know if that's normal or not though, just  my observation with no real parse.  <br /> <br />WJ, your right, I am not a High Level Warrior, I am a mid level warrior, level 67 to be exact, and have been for quite a while. I have stopped levelling to get the AA's most would have had by the time they were level 65, but I levelled up believing that Level is greater then AA. I feel I made a mistake, and have stopped levelling all together, and have aquired 43 AA's since levelling (I had only 6 before 67-run 3), so a total of like 49 I believe alltogether now.  <br /> <br />I haven't done Creator yet, can't get into the level 69+ zones yet. I can only go by the places I do group in, PLaces like MPG, WoS, NC, and solo/box in places like UP, GE, etc. I have 3 accounts worth of toons, not counting my Son's account. His SK is level 57, and I have tanked with him in NC. I have also done some don zones with him, such as Lavaspinner's Lair, Stillmoon temple, etc. Mainly, when I use his SK, I am using my 66 Chanter (On same account as my warrior), along with my 54th level Mage, and 57th level cleric. I know how much it takes to heal my warrior, and how much it takes to heal his SK. I know how easily I hold aggro with either one, and how to do it.  <br /> <br />When I get more then one mob, I hold back on healing my warrior and use a HOT potion (love them), till incite refresh's, then I change target's, and get the second mob with Incite. Then It's pretty safe for my cleric to start healing with no worrie's about getting aggro. With the SK, I just change target's smack with a good hate spell, go back to first, Tap, etc, I can heal with my cleric almost right away, with no worry of aggro.  <br /> <br />However, what I consider a grind group, is when I am not boxing, but trying to grind. I ussually grind with a 70 Monk, 70 Pally, me on my warrior, any healer, and the other two slots with nothing but DPS. The monk I grind with ussually tanks, but both that monk, and the pally are good in game friends. The problem is sometimes they aren't around. That's when I have mostly guildies, and it's ussually 65+ Beastie, rogue, RAnger, cleric, and sometimes either a berserker or another Beastie. Still pretty good dps. When we get our rhythm, the pulls get faster and faster, and the mobs run out (Where we are anyways), making us sometimes move to a better position.  <br /> <br />Since I am from a very casual guild, and the people I group with most the time are casual player's, I would think that our average would be pretty consistant with other's. If that's not the case, and our guild kills twice as fast, then I'm wrong, and we are much faster then everyone else I guess. I don't understand how, but I will bow down and say, OK, Your pulling Ldon's at 45 to 60 seconds per mob (or Don's, Or Wos, etc, whatever), and only MY guild, the casual, barely flagged for POS/POV guild, does it faster then everyone else. <br /></p>

<p>Well what I have leared and I do, do a lot of high end raiding in elemental planes, is that yes the regular taunt skill does stack with below argo or at lower lvl whould be incite. To make them stack you have to hit taunt skills first then hit below or incite second to make them stack.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>The only reason that I can think of why the Warriors wouldn`t press Taunt every time it pops is this: <br />Taunt has refresh time of few seconds , meaning if you lose aggro while taunt is down you will have to wait few seconds untiel you can taunt again , which means a dead caster usualy ( they go down fast you know hehe ) . So keeping taunt up while you have aggro and using it only in case you lose aggro sounds logical to me .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> However , if you ever played a Warrior you know by now that taunt fails most of the time and it`s the #1 reason why Warriors lose aggro when they dont have good aggro weps that are auged with stun or hate procs. When taunt doesn`t fail it will put you on top of hate list of the mob = you have aggro. Only exeption to this is low HP aggro , nothing helps there which bring us back to what I said earlyer:  <br /> <br />If taunt is not up = wait period for taunt to refresh = caster geting smacked = mob geting the caster to low HP aggro = dead caster = whining caster from bind point untiel he gets rezed = Warrior annoyed = drama in the group.. etc  :) <br /> <br />As for me.. I have taunt and kick button linked so whenever it pops up I press it and I taunt and kick at same time , works well for me and in case I lose aggro ( which allmost never hapens :p ) <br />I use Cyclone Blade if there are no mezed adds around ( becouse CB breaks mez ) or if nothing else helps I use Area Taunt as last resort before member of the group gets to Low HP . <br /> <br /></p>

<p><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />Quote: <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />My berate is almost always still unrefreshed by the time the second mob is almost dead, we ussually chain pull, and the puller is already killing the second mob while the first one is about to die. Your conclusion is built around the way you play, you might not chain pull, or you might not actually engage till your incite button is refreshed, <br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />It is very clear that the writer of the above believes that berate takes 60 seconds to refresh. Anyone who has plaied a warrior to any signiffent lvl at all knows that it refreshes ever 30 seconds, but last 60 seconds.&quot; <br /> <br />True, Incite refresh's every 30 seconds. This don't change the fact that it's ussually not refreshed by the time we are on the next mob... ? What's that got to do with what I said though? <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Anez in the first post you state that the second mob is almost dead by the time incite refreshes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that you kill mobs in just about 15 seconds.  And there is no way you do.  Since this is impossible (for a lvl 67 war killing dark blues) Odds are you have never used inceite (or bellow etc) and are therefore not playing a warrior. <br />In the second post you back off a bit, trying to bring your kill rate down to about 30 seconds.  Which you do not do.  Not in Wos or MPG.   <br /> <br />Now lets look at the group you clame to get this kill rate with an d remember you clame you chain pull in WoS and MPG <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />However, what I consider a grind group, is when I am not boxing, but trying to grind. I ussually grind with a 70 Monk, 70 Pally, me on my warrior, any healer, and the other two slots with nothing but DPS. The monk I grind with ussually tanks, but both that monk, and the pally are good in game friends. <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /> <br />Ok so you are in MPG with no slower (nothing but DPS dose not included any class that can slow.) In your casual little group you have a monk that not only out aggros a warrior, he can also tank in MPG with out a slower, On top of that you have a Pali who can also tank in MPG with no slower.   <br />Ok lets give you the benifit of the doubt and say you have a beast as one of your nothing but dps classes.  So you now have a beast that can tank in MPG.  Since these mobs resist slow and monks have  very poor aggro at the start of a fight (nothing but dps and it takes some time to build enough dps based hate to hold a mob vs slow)  Maybe you ment that the knight stunes the mob to build enough aggro for the beast can slow, and then the monk takes over.  Problem is monks can't taunt and with the mob dieing every 30 seconds there just ins't enuough time for the monk to regain aggro before she has to run out and get another mob.  In fact if you were chanin pulling in MPG and killing a mob every 30 seconds the monk is going to do very little other than pull.  So you will be with out your best dps and tanks. <br />Furthermore the group is very melee dependent (only one caster or no slower) and thus to have a decent kill rate need good haste...and beast haste just isn't that good.   <br />In short the group you described can not kill every 30 in Wos let alone MPG.   <br /> <br />Now lets remember that the puller is killing the seconed mob while the group is finishing off the frist. So in your group as you descirebed it you also have a cleric that can heal two tanks fighting unslowed MPG mobs with out getting aggro and keeping both alive and not running out of mana even though there would be almost no med time.   <br />One of the porblems with this is the fact that Mobs in MPG flurry and can hit in the 800.  It is not uncommon for a tank to take 2k hps worth of damage in an instant from a slowed mob.  And most healers have to be on their toes to keep one tank up, let alone two.   <br /> <br />In short you did not know how long it took for incite to refresh and therefore most likly do not play a warrior.   <br />The group you clame kills in 30 seconds would be torn apart in any of the zones you menctioned.  The tactics of your group is much more like twinks playing in DL than casual groups exping in WoS. <br /> <br />Based on your own statments odd are you do not play a lvl anything warrior.  Odds are you play a lvl 50 something knight.  <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />[/quote] <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" /><hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" /><hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" /><hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />[quote]<hr size="1" /></blockquote></p>

<p>A warrior's first line of building hate is really getting the attention of the mob.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its those first few seconds as the puller is bringing in the NPC that you have your chance, before everyone else gets ahold of it.  This can be quite a task for them if other classes are slowing, tashing, snaring, etc as the mob is still incoming to the group . . . . <br /> <br />I personally use a rather high powered bow with acrylia (Fire or Shadow) arrows on incoming mobs.  As the mob gets in range I use bazu (last of berate line of disciplines) then taunt as it attempts to squish me between its toes.  I personally find warriors (or at least mine) has been increasingly dependent on endurance to hold agro because of the disciplines.  There is more then one discipline!  Know what they are used for, and when to use them.  On my primary hot pad I also have regular old kick and disarm.  Kicks will critical with warriors -- it adds up, take down the &quot;/who all guild&quot; and put something in there useful.  I haven't seen myself disarm something in ages, but it does iritate them that my warrior is arrogant enough to try.  I have seen mobs turn on me with these keys, its not a waste of hotkey space. <br /> <br />Depending on how your warrior is used, warriors need certain AAs like any class.  The more DPS (Damage per second) one lands ands to the whole picture.  If you spend most of the time as the main tank, really consider alternating between defensive and offsensive AAs.  Every little bit counts.  Good luck out there. :) <br /> <br />Laene of Bristlebane <br />70th level Warrioress</p>

<p>Warrior joe, first realise, that we don't need a slower in WOS. Then realise that the monk solo's the named there, with no healer. Now put some things together.. You will eventually get it I'm sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Monk = Puller, and TAnk, Has an aug on his weapon for holding aggro, Pally is low aggro, and even without any healer at all, can keep the Monk alive without much problem, even if we don't have a healer. Now, imagine everyone attacking this mob on incoming, no slow, nothing but the pally, me, the Monk, and dps /nuking or hitting. The Pally stuns the mob around 45% to 35%, till him or me (Using my disc) can get aggro off the monk so he can pull another one, he pulls, brings back the mob, if our's isn't dead yet, he offtanks till it's running, then comes over and helps us with the running mob, ussually doing a &quot;death blow&quot; or something to it, whatever AA Monk's have that kill a mob dead while running, at that level. <br /> <br />The funny thing, the new mobs hitting the monk in the back this whole time, and it's not really doing much noticeable damage.. I have got over an AA an hour with this set up. I know there is better experience out there, (Creator, etc.) but that limits the group to being all level 60+, and at times I have to use my cleric as a fill in, till we find another, and it don't matter what we get as a healer either, SHammy, Druid or Cleric, (SHammy prefered, for pet DPS). <br /> <br /></p>

But noone is going to believe that a lvl 67 warrior with less than 50 aa's can tank a unslowed WoS mob with only a Pally to heal.   <br /> <br />Now there are many more problems with your most recent attempt to convince the world that you can kill dark blue mobs in less than 30 seconds... however I see no need to point them all out.</p>

<p>Ok people a few things, Taunt does not increase aggro...ever. <br /> <br />It only puts you at the top of the aggro list. <br /> <br />Therefore, if you are already at the top of the list, IT DOES NOTHING. <br /> <br />Now that thats clear, lets talk to these so called experts who think that mobs at the &quot;high end&quot; game do not die in 30 seconds or less, consistently. <br /> <br />I play a lvl 70 necro along with a warrior and I can generate enough DPS to kill mobs in Riftseekers in less than 30 secs, EVERY FRIGGIN TIME, INDEFFINITELY. And this is using DOT's, heaven forbid I chain nuke. Mobs die in 20-25 seconds usually.&nbsp;&nbsp;This, my friends, is the &quot;high-end&quot; game, and if you arent doing it, then you need to gear up, or get better grouping partners. <br /> <br />One more thing, having played a necro for over 6 years now, and a warrior for about 4, I can say this:  Paladins can always outaggro equal lvl and equally geared warriors...IF THEY CHOOSE TO.  Chain stun will take aggro and keep it, nuff said.  Any arguements as to the contrary are ignorant and futile.  I DON'T LIKE IT, trust me, but if a Knight wants aggro and my warrior is tanking, they can take it in no time and keep it. <br /> <br />These are just the cards we have been dealt, now this of course does not factor in any hate procs or other crap, just pure abilities.  If you factor in hate procs, well then all bets are off, but I would still put my money on the knight for aggro. <br /> <br />Thank you for your time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sun Sep  4 23:04:57 2005 by Hadesborne</span></i></p>

<p>Anez , you full of shiat my friend. I dont know any sane player that have the dps to kill a mob in 30sec would EVER xp in Wos hehe it`s just not hapening. <br /> <br />Hadesborn , dont dream bud . Warrior wielding DBoW is an aggro mashine . Pally cant get aggro from him I dont care how many stuns he uses kk. On raids when pally is a MA for trash sometimes.. I draw aggro with Dbow from them without even trying , while he chain stuns the mobzor kk . <br /> <br />No warrior realize how powerfull class that is untiel they have at least DBoW /1.5 combo.. and all defence/offence AAs done</p>

<p>I am acutally a bit confused. I thought this string was about taunting in addition to using disciplines. So far I mostly see people fighting over who is the better tank and who can take a mob down faster. 30 seconds? Well actually I do not care how long it takes as long as the tank is doing his job- getting hit so other people in group don't and can do their jobs to help take the mob down. It has been my experience that Warriors if they are well equipped, used the proper AA'a and know how to play their toons well are awesome tanks. There are some awesome pali's and sk's out there too but most of the time they are worried about casting, stealing agro, and saving their loh for themselves if things get bad instead of adding to the group. Now I know there are some that say I am dumb and don't know what I'm talking about and yes, I am not a warrior, Pali or SK but I am a cleric and see things from a different perspective. Oh yeah the 30 second thing, well I know for a fact that in high level Don's (67-69 average) that mobs can be taken down in about 24 seconds if there is a tank holding agro and there is good dps in the group. That's how long my hot lasts so I have timed it. <br /> <br />----- <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Tue Sep&nbsp;&nbsp;6 22:51:54 2005 by Charyme</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Tue Sep  6 22:52:29 2005 by Charyme</span></i></p>

<p>I agree, I play a 65 War with low aa's (around 70) and decent gear, and the only thing I do is hold agro and fight (general rule I die first),But on my 67 Mag I have 8 SK's on my ignore list all level 70 for FDing when they got too low and wiping the groups, 3 of them even aske me to go buy a pearl and summon them out of the area beacause the mobs stayed on top of them, and I have 5 Pallies on my ignore list, due to them losing agro to the cleric (no idea why, not attacking them for this, its happened to my war as well) They can't get the mobs off the cleric and cleric goes down, next thing you know they lay hands on themselves and run for it. they where level 67-70 (first time I saw that I thought I had met the worst pally in the game, just to learn that he had 4 twins.) I by no means am saying that Wars can hold the best agro, but I have yet to meet a pally at my level with the same equipment as myself and a similar amount of aa's who could stand up to mobs like I can, Every single one, had his horse, and most of the AA's they had went to casting instead of defence. On the same basis SK's have spent their points on the horse as well, just not sure about what else they have spent on, but that little weasle of a pet they keep wanting me to summon pet toys for bugs me to no end. </p>

<p>Haha, got to agree there are a few palies and sk's on my ignore list. One particular pali was waited on by group for almost an hour why he got useless buffs in pok for him to only start complaining a half hour into a mission that he didn't want to tank anymore cause his finger hurt from hitting the taunt button. Another SK, is on ignore list for FD'ing while tanking becasue he got down to 45% health and saw the &quot;Complete heal incoming message&quot; which by the way was cast 8 seconds prior to him FD'ing. </p>

<p>Trying to link magelo, can't figure it out. HP 11026 AC 1976.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Transcended Fistwraps of Immortality, Flay'd fresh handwraps, and uses 2hander Bonestaff of Wickedness. He does 30 second fights' no matter who he's grouped with, and you will find him in WOS Alot. When I'm trying to grind, that's one friend I ask to come group with me. I have yet to see us in many, many different group settings, with him in group, go over 30 second fights (Permob). Add a necro, or wizzy, rogue, it's all less and less time. It's not a cheat, no one is doing nothing but trying to kill the mob's. IF we get two, three, whatever, long as it's not TOO many, it's all good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Wed Sep  7 03:47:43 2005 by Anez</span></i></p>

However, I think that the SK was stupid to FD without having an ALT to take over tanking (designated before hand). <br /> <br />SK's use FD as an agro management tool (same as Monks and Necro's).  As a puller, I use FD exclusively.  I have also used it to buy a couple of seconds during late cast CH (if there is an ALT MT designated - I die at my post if not).  As soon as it lands, I stand and cast TOD/CD to reestablish agro. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Wed Sep  7 16:09:23 2005 by Necrophobe</span></i></p>

<p>Well unfortunetly for us we were caster full and the SK that FD was ONLY tank. Because of his actions our mag who was next on hate list got immediate agro. The worst part of this it was during a plane of justice trial while taking down the last named before winning. Luckily, I finished my ch in time and was able to pop a quicky 1.8 sec quick heal and save the mag. Our chanter nuked the mob and by the luck of the gods landed a crit which helped finish it off. The SK was still FD even after his ch hit, he never got back up until the mob was dead. Even worse yet, he demanded the loot from from the named even though he could not use and there was need in the group. Those are the type of players that get on my ignore list. </p>

<p>Frankly, I didn't even bother to finish reading the thread once I saw WarriorJoe's name on the following post. Let me clear this once and for all, and if it has already been stated, good. <br /> <br />Aggro = Aggro.&nbsp;&nbsp;1000 instant aggro followed by 0 aggro for 10 seconds is 100 aggro per second.  One may call this &quot;snap aggro&quot;. <br /> <br />Aggro = Aggro.  100 aggro over 10 seconds is still 1000 aggro, just not as effective because of the amount of time it takes for the aggro to &quot;work&quot; or to be noticed by el mob.  Once may call this &quot;building aggro&quot;. <br /> <br />Knights will always be more effective (to the experienced and knowledged player) because of this.  The most important part of a fight is the beginning.  1000 aggro in the beginning is better than 100 aggro in the beginning. Notice, wars and knights can both taunt, wars have a dot hate spell (let's call it a spell), and knights have an instant hate spell. <br /> <br />Ho there wonder!!!!!!!!  A knight can cast this &quot;spell&quot; at will, a war cannot.  Hint hint. For example: <br /> <br />Seconds or ticks, either way it will work, I like seconds more <br /> <br /> <br />    WARRIOR----------------KNIGHT (PAL/SDK) <br />1st 100 hate---------------                 <br />2nd 100 hate---------------1000 hate <br />3rd 100 hate--------------- <br />4th 100 hate--------(&quot;Eh, another stun won't hurt&quot;) <br />5th 100 hate---------------1000 hate <br />6th 100 hate--------------- <br />7th 100 hate---------------  <br />8th 100 hate--------(&quot;Ahhh, one more for good measure&quot;) <br />9th 100 hate---------------1000 hate <br />10th 100 hate <br /> <br />Total hate = 1000      Total hate = 3000 hate <br /> <br />Oh my gawd, what have we here?  Please note that DoTs cannot stack, therefor the bazu/berate/incite/provoke line has a fixed effectiveness.  Therefor, objectivly speaking: <br /> <br />Fixed effectiveness X Taunt = War effectiveness <br />Willed effectiveness X Taunt = Knight effectiveness <br /> <br />Knight aggro &gt; War aggro  <br />Even if you poped the random hate proc in between the DoT hate, a knight can still out aggro with such ease.  <br /> <br />2 procs per min = 700 X 2 = 1400 hate + 1000 hate = 2400 hate <br /> <br />Please note that 2400 hate is &lt; 3000 hate.  Knights win the hate war!!!!! (I love puns). <br /> <br />Please note that this does not make a knight more effective than a war, effectiveness is entirely relative, not subjective. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Fri Sep 30 11:36:06 2005 by schmidtw</span></i></p>

But I really can't blame Knights, since it was their great day of glory.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Yes during the early days of PoP it was a great advantage to be able to generate a lot of hate at the start of a fight.  This was because most slowers at the time where chanter. (Pre PoP shaman where having a very hard time getting groups because chanters could do more, and could last long enough if they got aggro for the tank to regain it) <br /> <br />Now-a-days <br />Most slowers are beast or shaman and have no problem surving a few rounds if they get aggro.  Furthermore todays buffs and equipment are much better compaired to the damage the mob dose then during the early days of PoP. <br /> <br />The most important part of the fight is the part in which the tank is most likly to lose aggro to someone who can only last a few rounds going toe to toe with them mob.  In the early days of PoP this was the begining.  Today it is the middle or the end of the fight.   <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />wars have a dot hate spell (let's call it a spell), and knights have an instant hate spell.<hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />  <br />Don't you just love folks who have no idea what they are talking about.   <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Quote:</b><hr size="1" />2 procs per min <hr size="1" /></blockquote> <br />If you believe a lvl 70 warrior only gets 2 proc/min you really shouldn't try and figure out which class generates the most hate. <br />   <br /> <br /> <br />It is intersting to note that all those who aggrue that knight are better at holding aggro do so on a bassis of what each class can do.

Several other knights of both classes report the same thing time and a gain. Many warriors also say the exact same thing. This is further backed up by HARD DATA that has been parsed repeatedly over several years. <br />While warriors have a DPS advantage, a single cast from one of our stuns generates FAR MORE aggro than any proc a warrior has, and runs pretty even with their discs. Chain stun and the knight really gains some serious aggro. The only time warriors gain an advantage in hate is at the VERY HIGH END (Anguisg and beyond). A lot of this simply comes from the fact that other classes have insane DPS, but are USED to having to control it for warriors and are more careful, while they are used to the glory days of knight aggro when they couldn't even come close to pulling aggro from the knight. <br />WJ often says that the chain stunning argument is pointless cause &quot;Pallies dont chain stun&quot;. Pure BS. Pallies do it all the time. In fact, the biggest complaint on the offcial paladin board at SOE is that we HAVE to chain stun these days to hold aggro.</p>

<p>In Knights defence, yes I do see some chain, and they do hold agro better than my war does for the first 20 mins of the group. then they don' bother to tell anyone they are oom, and the first big nuke that hits pulls agro, the slower is constantly grabbing agro. finally someone has to suggest that we med so that the knight can regen his mana, otherwise all he is doing a sporadic stun here and there. now this may not be a problem in the lower end of the game, but it seems to happen allot in the high end, where people have insane dps, and everyone seems to have to have the pysicic ability to read when the knight is out of mana in order to know when to hold back. as far as wars go. you could never consider combat abbilities the same as spell, Wars can normally go an multiple hours without a prob unless the are slamming every ability they have out all the time (seen it, and don't play with them anymore),So A knight might have the supiorior ability to hold agro, it has to be tempered by the ability to maintain this ability thoughout their group. remember also, that a knight that pulls isn't medding at all, which will slow down his mana regen more. I understand that I didn't make any charts to prove this, all I have is my xp in the game. <br />my two coppers <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Mon Oct&nbsp;&nbsp;3 10:32:43 2005 by Tawynia</span></i></p>

<p>Ah-hahahahahaha.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel so sorry for you WarriorJoe.  I do (did) play a warrior and a paladin and a shadowknight and I know what they can and cannot do (70 war btw). <br /> <br />Please, I was strictly refering to a generalization.  If you want hard core numbers, I shall deliever them. <br /> <br />A shadowknight can &quot;nuke&quot; 1800 hate just about every 8 seconds. <br />A warrior can &quot;nuke&quot; 600 hate + 100 hate per 6 secs for 1 min every 30 seconds. <br /> <br />A warrior has a fixed total of WILLED HATE (ignoring AE, whirlwind, cyclone, etc) of 1700 hate per 30 seconds. <br /> <br />A shadowknight has a fixed total of WILLED HATE of (in theory) 6750 hate per 30 seconds.  The spell costs 60 mana, a mear gnome fart compared to the endurance used in bazu, but lets assume you've got 9^99 end. <br /> <br />Any class gets 2 procs per minute, or 1 proc per 30 seconds on average with a weapon with 100 innate proc.  Summoned cleric hammers have 600ish, so they proc like mad, and ED has 80ish, so they proc like a gnome's left ear.  The DBotW has a proc rate of 100, just like the jolly CHoS.  So, without any + to combat effects, a lvl 70 war will proc the same as a 70 sk. <br /> <br />So, in theory, a sk with a hate aug and a war with 2 hate augs will proc the same number of times.  Amazing no?  Go read up on other forums on how procs work, or better yet,  <br /> <br /><a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=27183" title="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=27183" target="akztarg">http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/sho...eadid=27183</a> <br /> <br />you won't go wrong with this. Just scroll down and look for combat effects. <br /> <br />Anyhow, the point is that warriors simply do not have the power to will their aggro like a shadowknight or a paladin can. That is why so many classes can outaggro warriors, because they can easily demand aggro.  For a knight, or in that case any hybrid class to lose aggro to a war that is equally geared (same expansion tiered) is a shame, especially if they as well have taunt, because since procs are the same, then you can cancel out proc rate between classes because proc_class_a = proc_class_b. Same with taunt (the mod difference between classes is so barely noticable)  Therefor, all that is left is weapon delay and willed aggro, and since willed aggro is a bajillion (yes, a bajillion) times better than weapon delay aggro, willed aggro wins, and since knight willed aggro &gt; war willed aggro, knights win.  It is not that hard to realize.  This does not mean that knights can tank boss raid mobs (for their expansion tier), it just means they are better at holding aggro.  Stop trying to say warriors are the best at everything, because they don't at being sucky, that's ranger talk.   <br /> <br />So, to mathimatisize it: <br /> <br />Taunt = Taunt, cancel taunt; <br />1h Hate proc + 1h Hate proc = 2h hate proc, cancel proc; <br />2h weap delay &lt; 1h weap delay + 1h weap delay <br />6750hate per Y seconds &gt; 1700hate per Y seconds, Y = Y <br />Since 6750 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1h weap delay X 2, <br /> <br />Therefor knights, rangers, wizards, necros, shamans, enchanters, rogues, berserkers, mages, possibly beasts, etc etc can out aggro wars because they can will aggro.  Please, don't confuse people about who are the undisputed aggro machines; they casting classes.  Realize we know what we're speaking of. <br /> <br /> <br />Toccata and Fugue in D minor rules...like Zepplin!!!)~~~Go Otto-man</p>

<p>My beef is being rolled up into the 'knight' group when making assumptions/observations on agro generation vs Warriors. <br /> <br />WJ commonly refers to Paladin's as Knights, and Shadowknights as chopped liver (well, kinda ;-).&nbsp;&nbsp;The two classes cannot be summed together as their roles differ (even though both classes are hybrid  tanks). <br /> <br />Paladin's and SK are huge agro generators.  However, our spell books take different approaches towards achieving this.  You cannot take raw hate numbers and apply them collectively when summing agro generation of the two classes.  <br /> <br />WJ is very old skool, been playing forever from what I gather.  Many of his observations come from someone who has been playing pre-kunark.  Give him a break... I'm feeling left out on the flame fest. <br /> <br /></p>

The place where the problem shows up is in the really high end. This is because of how the stun model works and levels off at the high end, with the exception of our Ancient stun. The DPS classes have continued to have increases at a much higher rate and so pallies are having issues. (Note that warriors are reporting similar issues, though not as signifiacnt as they have more tools. SKs, however, are apparently not having these issues ATM). <br />At the normal one group level, the knights still tend to hold the advantage.</p>

If any class used anger procs they would be getting the same aggro as warriors, just they <b>don't need to have anger procs auged </b>because they can cast their aggro, therefor while a warrior will randomly proc hate, a sk or pally or ranger will have to cast hate, and that means cast it over and over and over and over and over if need be.  If a war and a ranger for example were to compete for aggro, both with 1H weaps with an aggro proc on each weap, both having the same dex, lvl, taunt skill, etc, whomever would deal the more dps would have the most aggro.  Pallys and shadowknights and rangers need to recast their spells because they simply don't have the same procs that wars do on their weaps, because if they did, they wouldn't have to cast nearly as often.

<p>Something that might be of interest: <br /> <br />Seems that taunt, is now not only believed to be broken by warrior's (Maybe not WJ, but most), but is indeed broke, and SOE has plans on fixing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />Just thought it would be of use to the original poster  <br /> <br /> <br /><blockquote><b class="sm">Dracosfren wrote:</b><hr size="1" />seen a few people posting things about how they get aggro but notice they are just using disc not adding taunt into there aggroing. People Warriors canuse taunt and discs together you dont just have to use incite or bellow you can use taunt too. now i understand why i see so many warriors being yelled at about aggro from casters these last few weeks <br /><hr size="1" /></blockquote>  <br /> <br />With this comment : &quot;The devs have recently found a bug in the taunt code that has been there last 5 years. Look for a fix soon.&quot;    <br /> <br />I am level 69 Warrior now, and have over 160 AA's, hoping to have 200 by this weekend, and by next weekend (maybe sooner) be level 70...  <br /> <br />I have to point out, that AA's effect Proc's as well, such as Weapon Affinity, so WJ (Whom I hate to aggree with) just might have a couple valid points. I understand that AA = AA however, and one with the same AA's would proc just as much, so that would also eliminate the AA approach, except for the fact that Knight's (BOTH) Rarely use Hate aug's (Unless they are an alt to a warrior, LOL). Willed aggro will always win over random (proc) aggro, since all you have to do is cast again, and POOF, aggro is back. Most knight's want to hit as much as they cast, so that could explain WJ's belief that a Pally doesn't cast stun's throughout the fight. <br /> <br />Another poster said something about a Knight going OOM and losing aggro.... Their is parses that show's Pally's do not go OOM Stunning, NEVER.... If they went OOM, they have been doing alot of the group healing and other things, to an extreme, or to make up for group weakness (Cleric not healing other's in group).  <br /> <br />I do not think Warrior aggro should be able to out aggro Knight aggro at the beginning of the Fight's, however I do think that Warrior's need more over time aggro, as Pally's need to think about auging their weapons on the high end, rather then looking for a super stun (or other spell) to keep aggro. Their should always be a chance of the Tank losing aggro from other's not watching themselves. To give this (Super) Power to a Pally, would trivialise stunable content even more.  <br /> <br />Remember, that there has been parses that show, &quot;The knight is a 5.2-7.2% better tank than a warrior in stunnable content without ever casting a heal on himself when both either have or do not have shields.&quot; and : &quot;warrior total:  4.3% in melee damage reduction/survivability benefit <br /> <br />Knight total:  15-17% in stun avoidance, and 3.5% in shield block <br /> <br />The knight is a 14.2 to 16.2% better tank than a warrior in stunnable content without ever casting a heal on himself in the most common configuration of Knight using a shield, warrior not using a shield. <br /> <br />Heals add a significant amount to that survivability.&quot; <br /> <br />Pally's do not go OOM even when chain stunning for 30 minutes to 1 hour.  <br /> <br />It will be interesting to see what changes/err... FIX is made to taunt.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><a href="HTTP://eq.stratics.com/" title="HTTP://eq.stratics.com/" target="akztarg">HERE</a> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Wed Oct 12 12:44:31 2005 by Anez</span></i></p>

<p>OK I use the mash the taunt key method which i understand everyone is saying isn't supposed to work since a successfull taunt puts me at top of the agro list.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not to sure this is true, I have had to use 3 taunts on mezed mobs to make sure that my first hit to break mez lets the mob agro me. I use the Dbow and 1.5 both EB augged. So I have 4 hate procs that can go off at any given time or all at once about 2k + of hate, have about 15 to combat effects and max AA's for procs. I usually only use mash taunt to hold aggro and Incite when I lose agro to a caster or melee. If I need snap agro I use AE taunt or Cyclone (depends on if mobs mezed or not). In my mash taunt hotkey is Kick+taunt+disarm. I lose agro occaionally to monks who now have the 1500 unresistable DD, but incite gets it right back along with monks FD or real death. (all of which work for me)  <br /> <br />Was always my understanding that taunt skill was a fixed hate addition, and appears to function as that, have never seen just a successfull taunt pull agro off a caster who just nuked once. I might be wrong but that is my experience, played for 5 years on same warrior, in and out of raids. So take this information anyway you want. My warriors name is Claydogtwo. Oh and 30 second kills possible with with Shaman,Ranger,Wizard,Enchanter,Cleric,Warrior for group in MPG and Creator missions. New shaman buffs rock. <br /></p>

<p>Yeah, Shammy's rock, that added nuke for all mellee's proc's an awefull lot. Sometime's seem's to proc every round, and ussually two people proc'ing. Anyhow, I give up on trying to relay what is possible, in the way of mob's per minute. If those that don't believe it's possible want to believe that, then I'm not one to shun on their parade. <br /> <br />SOE has recently admitted that Taunt is broken. Taunt works at around 8% or less for yellow con mobs, and red mobs is almost impossible to actually taunt, even when you get the message that it was successfull. I think I finally understand why I was getting successfull taunts, and couldn't get aggro off my Friend's monk. It's cuz the mobs were red to me. <br /> <br />Far as blue mobs go, I've had taunt not work as well, so that's why I tend to believe what a different poster posted. IT has a maximum. So if your group is doing over the maximum aggro taunt has, then it would appear to stack. Someone got a bit bent out of shape over me posting this before, but they didn't leave us with any proof, or at least a link to proof that his thoughts were anything but a myth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br />I believe Taunt puts you at the top of the hate list, if the aggro generated isn't over the maximum taunt can achieve. My understanding of computer's has always been there has to be a limit, although it can seem unlimited. If taunt is similar to damage for example, (You fall for 3200 damage!), or &quot;You have assassinated your target, you hit %t for 6400 damage. etc. Taunt probably has something like 3200 aggro, and if that nuker has build over 3200 aggro with one nuke, it would take you two successfull taunts to get to the top of the hate list.</p>

<p>I see alot of folks spewing garbage, with a fw actual fact's here that need's to be sifted from the garbage. <br /> <br />I have played a warrior for 5 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in a guild that has worked through ALL the old world expansions, Luclin, PoP, IN ORDER and are now nearly in Tac-vi flagged and have more than one MPG trial done and will be in Anguish within a couple month's as well.  I am one of our GUilds MT's, have the highest HP and AA of all our MT's.  I weild a Darkblade (with Chaotic Strik IV aug) and a Epic 1.5 with an EB aug and a Chaotic Strike IV aug (from evil side camp). <br /> <br />Now .. I'm NOT saying all that to do any kind of bragging, lord knows there are plenty of warriors advanced well beyond me.  I am stating all of that to let you know that I DO PLAY A WARRIOR FULL TIME and that I have since Day one in EQ and I'm fairly advanced in teh game as far as progression goes without skipping content.  I spend ALOT of time working through aggro issues, doing ALOT of research and have made MANY of the mistakes I see folks talking about in the post above.  These mistakes persisted until I was shown they were wrong and adjusted my play style accordingly.  In effect, I'm giving you my credentials ahead of time so you may take what I'm saying with a little more credence than someone that has &quot;played a warrior to lvl 65&quot;....which isn'the same as playing one full time by a long shot. <br /> <br />I only have one other char .. a Hydra Shammy that I use from time to time when groups are scarce. <br /> <br />First let me say, I did NOT read teh full 46 posts in this thread.  So If any other warrrior with ample experience has allready posted and I'm just rehashing, then sorry.  I stopped about number 15 or so when it became clear that there was alot of dissenting opinion on what taunt did and when to use it. Let me clear it up for you. <br /> <br />Here is the jist of taunt, what it does and how to use it. <br /> <br />Taunt does nothing other than move you to the top of the hate list +1.  If you allready have aggro, and you spam taunt, you are adding a whole whopping 1 hate to your aggro.  If a Monk has 500 Hate, and you taunt successfully, you have at that point 501 hate.  It's a waste to spam taunt and any warrior that knows what they are about will tell you this everytime.   <br /> <br />Anyone who professes to be a experienced warrior that tell's you to spam don't know what the hell they are talking about(conditionally .. there ARE fights where you need to &quot;fight&quot; for aggro later in the game as to share aggro with other tanks.  The steel warrior, back in the day when this debate was originally going on, did log parses, tests, experiments .. all kinds of stuff to finally arrive at this, and in my 5 years of playing a warrior, I have found this to be true as well.  Taunt need only be used when you NEED to get or reaquire aggro. That's all ... if your spamming, the only thing your doing is making sure taunt will be down when a wizard over nukes, or a Necro forgets to FD after he's piled on a bunch of DoT's and they've been going for a while. <br /> <br />As far as knight aggro, you can hold against sk's and pallies fairly decent.  But know this... if they WANT aggro, they will take it(if only breifly ... you can get it back with little difficulty if you try).  The thing is about the &quot;best XP grind tank&quot; debate is this.  A knight can quickly generate solid aggro earlier in a fight better than a warrior.  This is why many a slower prefer knights in XP groups.  Knights can allow casters to open up with nukes/slows/heals within initally aggroing a mob, no small delay necessary(and I'm not talking a minute or so.. merely seconds here once you get great aggro weapons all augmented out with WA 5 AA). Warrior's, even with great aggro weapons and augs with weapon affinity 5 and + Combat Effects still rely on the random number generator to generate anymore hate than 600 hate + 100 hate per tic(Bazu Bellow) + hate from weapon damage early in a fight.  But, and here's the kicker.  When your only talking a few seconds in a grind session that lasts 200 mobs, hours at a time or something .. that extra 5 or 6 seconds adds up over time. Hence the reason a chain pulling, ubbah xp group may prefer a knight as a tank.   A knight can gerate early aggro much better, so much so in fact that a very valid raid tactic is to have the knight cast a few hate spells / stuns to pull / position the mob and have the warrior to ae taunt once the mobs in place to give warriors that nice aggro boost early.  This isnt typically necessary anymore as warrior aggro has came leaps and bounds from what it used to be, but on some fights where (for various reasons) early aggro can be squirrely, the tactic is still used. <br /> <br />Warriors' think it's bad now ... you should have played a warrior before the skill's.  All we had were procs and taunt back then... no bazu bellow to shore up aggro and the problem was terrible.  During those dark day's, the height of PoP, I've seen (and experienced) warriors go LFG all night for multiple nights and be very lucky if they got a group.  We were only wanted for raids.  It was especially bad int eh ubbah XP zones like PoF back then, where lost aggro meant a guarentee'd death for a slower or healer. <br /> <br />Anyway.  Take the above post for what it's worth.  I know from years of experience what I'm talking about.  Don't spam taunt.  Save it for when it's needed and hope they Random Number genorator is kind enough to give you a sucessful taunt(or that bazu bellow is enough hate to get you aggro back if/when it fails). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />  </p>
