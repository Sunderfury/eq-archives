<p>*sigh* <br />You know, I said I wouldn't come back, at least not until more Enchanter issues are addressed. I'm still not coming back, not yet, but I did take the time to look around a bit. It's a shame how little has changed, especially for chanters. <br /> <br />Runes: Group rune for four dots. Yikes. Not only is it a bit harsh for cash-poor players, but the mana cost is extreme, and the runes still don't hold a candle to the melee damage faced by any chanter capable of casting these runes. Or how bout the Epic runes? The 1.5 would be, from what I see, for chanters who raid sometimes, and the 2.0 would be for the hardcore raiding chanter. The melee damage of mobs faced by these kinds of chanters is going to be even greater, yet the runes from the Epics are of un-noteworthy amount. Worse, I'm seeing issues where the little Boggle effect from these runes won't cast if you are doing just about ANYTHING when the rune drops. I've already mentioned how this Boggle effect is too often irrelevant, since the chanter is often the ONLY thing on the mob's hatelist... making it hate you less won't help much when it still hates only you and the tanks are busy elsewhere. I really do believe that it should be at least an AoE hatelist memblur (kinda like FM, except with FM a bard doesn't have to be in range, whereas this effect would be AoE only). <br /> <br />Does anyone else smell workarounds for enchanter surviveability? What's the plan, here, to just keep stacking runes on the chanter? Heck, a rune can't even be compared to, say, a HP buff, because a rune's hps cannot be healed, and if you compare it to a heal, it gets murdered (as a heal, a rune is slow casting, mana- and aggro-intensive, and has a reagent). I'm seeing SOE not really coming up with anything resembling a creative way to help chanters deal with their issues. I just see &quot;Are the chanters still complaining? Well, throw them another rune so we can say we did something.&quot; Some of these runes (noteably, the Epics) aren't even achievable for many chanters. Apparently, increasing chanter survivability by improving mezzes and improving their viability in groups by giving useful group-friendly spells still isn't on the table. <br /> <br />I was never particularly affected by the Charm nerf when I played. I would usually duo outer razorfiends in PoV with a druid or ranger. I do think chanters shouldn't be in control of quad 1k hitting pets, but I also think a simple fix would have been for SOE to simply put lesser mobs in many zones that could be charmed without doing this idiot &quot;charmed damage table&quot; business... maybe include some razorfiend-level mobs in spawn tables of high end zones. Poof! No more (or at least reduced) charm issue. Nevertheless, I do think that, if they insist on reducing charm effectiveness, they should compensate in other areas; a trade in the same field (pets) would be to boost the summoned pets. All I see is barely competitive spells for chanters' new levels, with reduced usage for some lines (a la charm and linked recast timers on some spells), no improvement in other lines, the continuation of at least two largely useless lines (Berserker Spirit runes and dots), and the discontinuation of useful lines like the PBAoE spells. <br /> <br />In the meantime, the only action on the chanter top 10 issues list is work on the Epics, which happened because SOE ended up having to rework ALL the Epics, and the change from considering the rest of the chanter issues to considering the possibility of considering those issues. They're not thinking about them anymore, they're thinking about thinking about them. And, for the first time in over half a year, a Dev has posted in the Station.com chanter forums... and only to comment on a possibly broken illusion spell quest. Like illusions even matter, anymore. <br /> <br />I dunno... I do read that some of the new content is a bit more chanter-friendly, altho' nothing really requires a chanter, and I understand the draw of community (it's the only reason I'm even considering returning right now), but I gotta wonder how many times you people will accept the bones SOE is tossing you before you finally decide you're tired of getting boned. This new expansion, even, looks like a lot of shiny but unnecessary &quot;improvements&quot; as an excuse for another $30-a-pop money grab, instead of needed fixes... SOE really just needs to skip an expansion and spend the time fixing stuff. It's sad that chanters only generally shine in content that's trivial to them at this point. <br /> <br />I just wish I could post this on the Station.com forum, but, without a subscription, I can't. Ah, well. <br /> <br />Game on, and good luck. <br />Jonny Panic <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sun Feb 20 19:24:31 2005 by jonnypanic</span></i></p>

<p>First of all, it was proposed that the group enchanter runes would cost 4 peridots. Personally I would have been fine with this, since by the time we get these spells, most of us have enough plat to afford it. The group rune was not made to be something we'd want to use consistantly, only situationally, and for good reason, since it can be used for dare I say powerleveling purposes and people could cast it all day if it didn't hurt to do so. <br /> <br />In any case, that was then. They modified the cost of the spell several times before actually releasing it, and finally settled on it not requiring a reagent, and instead raising the mana cost. Although it is a bit ridiculously high (1400 for the level 60 version alone, absorbs 950) we've always complained because we have so much mana we don't know what to do with it, and now have something. Something nice, for the levels they're given. <br /> <br />The epic rune is stackable with all of our other runes, so I don't think there's much merit in bashing it. <br /> <br />If the epic's AE boggle was a memory wipe instead, all pre-existing aggro that may have been placed on the mob by the tank trying to save your butt when the mob is beating on you would be erased as well. Furthermore if it went off and there were mezzed mobs, they'd in all likelyhood bee-line straight for your cleric as soon as it broke. No thanks, I like the current effect, especially now that they fixed the detrimental flag on it. <br /> <br />You mention runes being slow-casting mana-intensive and aggro-intensive, and having reagents. Targettable runes, yes. 500 mana for a 5-second cast time self-only rune which absorbs 2k in damage is Yes please, and it has no reagent. Never did. As for the aggro thing, rune really isn't That angering. I have never, personally, had a mob turn around and hit me again after losing aggro to a tank simply because I cast the spell. I have heard of this but in my own experience I can't see this being a problem we need to be concerned with, though it may be salt in the wounds to anyone who Has experienced unfortunate issues due to it. <br /> <br />The 'charm nerf' only applies to Omens of War zones from what I've seen. Feel free to correct me if you parsed results on your own but charm kiting in the Halls of Honor as an example has only become more difficult for me because they raised the magic resistance of some Planes of Power zones recently, not because the mob does less damage, or seems to. I will concede that charming mobs around your level in Omens is quite useless however but it has nothing to do with the nerf. Opinions are sure to vary from person to person though. I haven't charmed everywhere I can. I'm too Scared to, and I adore charm soloing outside of that expansion. <br /> <br />I could go on and on picking your post apart but there's really no point. Believe it or not, I'm with you. I don't agree with hardly any of your points but I do agree that the class got the shaft. However, it is not because of what SoE has done or not done to the class. I actually think they have taken several steps in the right direction. <br /> <br />What I think they messed up on was not scaling the class to the content but scaling the content to the class. <br /> <br />For the most part, they could sate the angry masses simply by lowering magic resist, and instead they keep raising it. End of story. I don't post much anywhere because I'm tired of watching this swarm of bees give unrealistic suggestions on how to outright modify the class at some points. It's no wonder no one official listens to most people. They say the devs can't do their job so try to do their job for them. I've heard everything from &quot;Let us wear plate!&quot; to &quot;give us suchandsuch godly spell which isn't so godly in this godly content (OoW, late GoD, etc) but can unbalance the game in simpler content which still is far less than trivial&quot;. <br /> <br />Bleh...</p>

<p>Johnny, <br /> <br />Your scepticism is understood; however, from your previous posts I believe you have taken your disappointment to a whole new level. <br /> <br />The rune thing that you discuss is interesting to say the least. Four dots for a grp rune for a prepatory raid encounter isn't too much to ask from SOE. That rune is designed for raid content with AEs and such, and for nothing more. <br /> <br />The epics are for the raiding enchanter, since it takes a raid to get through some of the fights. Think about when the 1.0 was king, those took a raid too and had nothing more than a clicky and a cool snake head on it. Oh yeah, stats too. It doesn't take a big mental leap to see that the content surrounding these new epics has to be difficult. <br /> <br />In some respects the chanter has gotten the shaft in the new expansions, but not the ones you are bashing on. As Jem said the resistances, specifically the MR have greatly increased, causing more mezzes to be thwarted on the first cast. What I don't see in the new spell line ups is an upgraded Tash line spell, nor have I seen a new slow spell. Something in the code must have been changed to allow us a great ability to still land our Forlorn Deeds after a simple cast of Tash, but still 6 seconds is a little much. True some spells and an aug or effect can lessen the time, but come on...6 seconds? <br /> <br />Look at our color stun series, or what is left of it. That has been faded out and only remains for our amusement while power leveling whole grps in the 30s with our stun locks. Or how about our warrior shadow pet that can dual wield and is 62 level, it actually can take a hit. But, they can't crit like a warrior, even when we stick a Saliks Haste on them to increase the chance of crits. The bug still exists, at least on my server, where you can give two summoned procing weapons to the pet, but only one shows until you either zone or suspend and reactivate the pet. <br /> <br />You speak of survivability. I am here to tell you that the chanter has no problem with the survival rate in high level OOW zones and the like. You do have to work for the abilities in the Alt Adv. but it can be done, I have proven that. I am constantly tanking in BoT with my Cleric wife; and in WoS, there have been many occassion that I am one of the only players standing at the end of a fight, along with the cleric. We have no problems to speak of. We certainly can't expect SoE to hand our power to us on a platter. They certainly have made the abilities for us to where we can take a few hits and still effect a positive outcome in the engagement. <br /> <br />I see no work-arounds that you speak of, they have made it so that if we want to take a hit we have to earn it. These are the same people that nerfed the taunt ability to 50% and increased hate AAs to tanking classes. They simply have to earn the ability to taunt mobs now rather than having it handed to them at level 1. <br /> <br />Charms suck any way you cut it. It is because of us chanters who misused the charming ability in the first place that allowed it to gain negative attention. I am not one of those chanters that charm killed groupable mobs and then turned around and sold the loot at an inflated price, but it sure did happen. Some may have even exploited a bug allowing them the ability to kill an otherwise unsoloable mob. We did it to ourselves on that one. I do not agree with the charmed mobs damage dropping, but for sake of another solution that was probably the fastest and most exact way to fix the power we could employ. <br /> <br />We, or maybe I should say, I, never expected my class to be one of those highly sought after classes that a group could not live without. It is true that we make a group's experience that much more safer, but that comes at a price. We are a misunderstood class to most. Most see us as nothing more than buffers and debuffers then we sit. They don't see us behind the screen with three-way timers for mez. They don't see us target assisting only to switch off of it to mezz an add. They can't understand why we freak out when a mezzed mob has been rudely woke up a second after mezz stuck the vermin.  <br /> <br />In the face of all that, we employ great power and great skill in the fantasy realm of Norrath. Play or don't play. The game is really what us chanters make it and nothing more. If we suck and don't put in the time to better our abilities then we run the risk of tarnishing our class image; but if we take the time, we shine that dull gray and change many a mind to our truly awesome powers that many never knew we had. <br /> <br />-Prost <br /> <br />You know you are powa when you can stick 12 mobs and duo kill them slowly...</p>

<p>You really shouldn't be playing enchanter if you're going to whine so much.  I for one am glad they nerfed chanters charm, because that's all I used to do was charm and neva realized the potential of my class in a group.  OOW came out with the intentions that no class should be able to solo the good portion of it.  So it'd actually take a little work to get the good stuff, instead of charming a high lvl mob and killing a named within seconds.  There is not too many spots in oow where and class can solo and get goodxp, plus drops all the time.  Sure a necro can kite mobs in a few areas, and maybe get a ultra rare drop in a month of playtime.  But you don't see them farming gear on their own.  You also don't see bards running around swarm kiting these zones, getting massive xp and loot.  This was a way to make every class to stop and think of ways to work together with the people around you and take out harder mobs that drops better gear. To dis rune, shows that you know nothing about enchanters.  An enchanter rune is his hp that he can heal ova and ova.  With quickbuff you can increase your rune cast by half which is like 2.5 seconds I believe.  On the majority of mobs this means you can chain rune and maybe never even get hit, depending on your defensive and stability.  Also if you have your epic 1.5 you can use this rune free of mana! (gosh) And I guess they didnt think of us when they gave us a low resist mez to save us from the ungodly aggro you get when mez resists, or maybe the low resist slow when you're trying to slow and it seems like the resist has more aggro then when they actually slow themselves.  To says enchanters aren't needed anymore is completely ignorant, have you ever been to a raid without enchanters?  <br /> <br />To end my post I would like to say you are a complete idiot and we don't want you in our enchanter community anyway, so please stay away.</p>

<p>Joo gotta look before ya post a bit, there, bub. <br /> <br />This original post is about 8 months old. I'd think ya kinda had ta dig a bit to resurrect it. <br /> <br />A lot can happen in eight months, all around... <br />SoE has made some headway in improving our situation as enchanters. <br />I quit for a while, then came back. <br />While I was off of EQ, I moved from Florida to Indiana. <br />I also almost died. Getting that close can really mellow a guy out. <br /> <br />I'd also like to ask you to look up my other posts in this forum and the SoE enchanter forums... many of my posts have been in the vein of trying to help others out. Posts like this are rather a minority, really. <br /> <br />If you are smart (wise, really, I guess), you'd let this thread die. I was going to let it do just that, until you came along. <br /> <br />If not, and you just came online to look for a fight, feel free to stay as far away from me as you can manage. I've since discovered that I can only be exposed to stupid for so long before I contract stupid poisoning. <br /> <br />7 posts, and yet you speak for the entire community... sheesh... kids these days...</p>

<p>Hmm, Pretty harsh words there at the end there Luxan. Maybe the enchanter forum is not a good place to flame people. Everyone has their opinion, but you speak in a weird tongue and really haven't experienced the zones you are making references to. To say a necro cannot, or does not farm for gear in omens is purely wrong. Necros own Nobles Causeway. I have personally seen shamans solo the south named in Wall of Slaughter without breaking a sweat, and out DPSing an entire group. I have seen Shadowhunter duoed with a cleric and a warrior. <br /> <br />Johnny had some things right in his post, and some things that were more emotion based than game based. Take it for that and let the thread die like Johnny has suggested. <br /> <br />I would finally like to end this post with saying:  <br /> <br />We help people on this forum, we don't flame them...you are probably the kind of person who sits in PoK and flames every new person in /ooc for asking an otherwise trivial question. If you aren't...then next time you post why don't you try helping someone.</p>
