<p>Hey all, <br />I have been wanting to post for some time now about the trials that an up and coming chanter goes through from 1-50 and beyond. So...here it goes. <br /> <br />As in previous posts in this forum the two most important stats to worry about are Charisma and Intelligence (believe it, live it and love it.) That being said, when gearing your chanter do not settle for 1 or 2 int/cha upgrades at the expense of plat, it simply is not worth it! I have done a lot of research in and out of the game and in and out of the bazaar, and most of the item prices are comparable to the blackmarket in most third world countries. &lt;~~~If you are a twink or have a main disregard this last comment. <br />I was not as fortunate as to have a money getter when I started my enchanter as an alt. In fact, most of you would agree that if you have been playing for more than 3 years, the progression of a PC is much much easier today as back in the day. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On with the progression... <br /> <br />1-10 level Solo Solo Solo- Now this will probably gain a lot of controversy, but I have found that I spent too much time medding in those early levels rather than just stabbing and tanking the mobs to gain XP. With the addition that Sony has seen fit to allow 1-10 PCs to keep all their gear when dying, I say use it to your advantage. Are you out of mana, just die. Tank white and yellow mobs easy. Best zones = Gfay, Nek forest (if DE), BBM and Crushbone. <br /> <br />10-20 Solo Solo Solo- Now these are the levels where you should start examining your spell lines and perhaps...use this site to look ahead at which lines will bring you to level 60. Those I will term as the chanter's Bread+Butter+Lines (BBL). Ok that being said 10-20 starts allowing the chanter a little more power than other classes, mostly having to do with our duel sticking ability to root and also mez. Sony also has helped the chanter out now by making it so the pet, that you have cast and subsequently allowed to agro onto a mob who has hit you, stop attacking when you mez it. This is the single most important thing that an enchanter must master early on, IF AND ONLY IF you want to continue to solo! The enchanter pet line has an awesome regain when out of combat, so use it to your advantage. Best zones I found are WC, EC, PC and still CB. <br /> <br />Now a word on fizzles and skills &lt;Spell casting skills specifically&gt; Each level that you gain grants you 5 skill training points that you can use by talking to a local Guild Master in many cities. Decidedly, you only need to train one point into any one skill for that skill to raise on its own when given the proper motivation. I cannot stress this enough, from 10-20 level cast a level 1 spell and get your spell skills up to par, your life and other's lives will depend on it. <br /> <br />Up to 20th level, mez, stun and root are sketchy at best, but you still need to use them if you solo. Now, a great trick to use when (saving) your pet from death is to enter melee range and take a few hits IF the mob is low enough that your pet can kill it within 10 seconds or so. I know it sounds weird and you may even be asking the question of why cause damage to your fragile body just to get a kill, but it becomes useful in the later levels when the rune line of spells and AA abilities come into play. So get used to it early. <br /> <br />If your are the kind of person who gets miffed or just plain torqued when your PC dies in the game, the enchanter class is not for you. The simple fact is, a chanter dies and dies fast in most cases. <br /> <br />20-30- These are the levels where you will most likely want to start grouping and becoming familiar with the group dynamic. Everyone will want some sort of buff from you like haste or breeze and maybe a few other weird things. Such is life get used to it, it only gets worse (figuratively). In these levels soloing becomes difficult mostly because of your pet's low hit point value as compared to damage output from the mobs you will be killing. It can be done with your BBLs, however, I suggest using these 10 levels to help groups rather than yourself. Best zones are HHK basement, NK, SK and LDoN now, and maybe DSP if you just can't find out where everyone is hanging out these days. <br /> <br />30-40- This is a very crucial point in a PC's progression. These 10 levels are where you need to really work on gaining charisma and intelligence to your max and beyond if possible. Again use this site as a reference for gear. Charisma tends to be pretty easy these days to get by spending 20pp on two charisma stiens in the bazaar and raising your charisma by 50. That added to your own charisma buff goes a long way to helping with CC (crowd control). I want to also stress that these levels should be primarily used to max out your intelligence per level as well, since int=mana and mana=life for you and the group. <br /> <br />A word on mezzing in a group now. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. There is nothing worse in a low level to mid level group than someone who is whining about one thing or another or placing blame on another PC. That being said, if a tank or damage per second (DPS) class breaks a mez, then live with and go on. It happens and it happens frequently. If you die because of a broken mez then perhaps something has to be said diplomatically and then the subject dropped. The single most important tool to use in these grouping levels is a macro message that is also slaved to casting your mez spell. The macros can be made and placed in the hot buttons window for easy (one-button) access. Remember, group chat spam is everyone's enemy and should be kept to a minimum. To aide in this your mez macro should be short and sweet. EX. &gt;&gt;&gt;Mezzing %t (name of mob) Mezzing&lt;&lt;&lt; or all in capital letters if you prefer. In these mid levels you may want to add something like &quot;If you wake it, You take it!&quot; but I would hope that you use that stuff sparingly. About 50th level the first macro message should be enough, since the other classes will have experienced grouping with chanters quite a bit.  <br /> <br />So the macro message should look something like this in the macro window... <br />Name MEZZ <br />&gt;&gt;&gt;MEZZING %t MEZZING&lt;&lt;&lt; <br />/cast 8 <br /> <br />EDIT: If you are now experiencing the raid machine you may want to add another line to the macro...ie. <br /> <br />Name Mezz <br />&gt;&gt;&gt;MEZZING %t MEZZING&lt;&lt;&lt; <br />/rsay &gt;&gt;&gt; MEZZING %t MEZZING&lt;&lt;&lt; <br />/cast 8 <br /> <br />***The second line can remain in the macro if you do not mind the warning from the game saying &quot;You are not in any raid channels,&quot; I seem not to mind since I have the cast message and the warning message split into two different chat boxes. *** <br /> <br />The cast number may be different for you, mine happens to be 8 since that is my designated spot for the spell to be in. And I will ALWAYS have a mez spell up. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have the spell up. I will not give you a line 1-8 spells to have up when grouping since the group dynamic and needs have changed dramatically since the introduction of LDoN missions. The spell line up is mainly your responsibility to explore and use, plain and simple. <br /> <br />40-50- With the induction of LDoN many people may want to use these levels to gain much needed points for spells and gear. In retrospect, I advise against it if you want to level fast. I would take your sorry little body to a little hole in the wall zone and level very fast by soloing. I raised 8 levels in one week in Crystal Caverns with my pet. At 40-45 I soloed the four Stalag Terrors at the broken bridge camp with my pet. I will not offer how to break the camp or easily solo it since I believe you should be able to look at the camp while invis and figure it out by yourself...if you cannot, you are playing the wrong class. There is also a dwarven village in here near the broken bridge so if you get in trouble you can simply run. (And you can sell in this village by using the alliance line of spells) From 45-48 I started killing the broken bridge mobs and the terrors behind the bone ribcage bridge near the geonid and spider camps. Runes are beginning to become important now, use them. At max charisma, 120 for merchants, a stack of jaspers for the Rune III spell costs 15pp. So you do the math, in CC the terrors drop between 1-5pp each kill on average. You make your money back plus some very quick. <br /> <br />50-60- These levels are the next round of building levels for Int/Cha, max them out. I urge you to get your Baroness title by amassing 6 AA points before you are 57th level. You can do this in HHK by killing nobles or bards. The reason for this is simple, run 3 will save your life. The other 3 points I put into charisma since I wanted to sacrifice some +6 Cha wrist items for better Int items to increase my mana pool. It is really up to you. Now it is decision time. Before 60th level I urge you to start saving up plat or start looking for a guild that can help you to get the KEI scroll. (On my server the scroll only costs 4-5k plat now.) That being said, there are two major buffs that everyone in groups will want. Haste and Crack. I will put my foot down and say to begin raising levels and AA points together. The reason is simple MANA PRESERVATION. By increasing AA points and at least having Spell Casting Reinforcement 2 and maybe even a Rokyl's Channelling Crystal you will have saved a lot of mana in the long run by increasing your buff duration. <br /> <br />Post 60 will go fast for you as an enchanter in the planes and LDoN. I simply went from 60-65 in 2 weeks with infrequent play in LDoN missions. The hardest part about 60+ is getting the much needed uber spells. <br /> <br />*** I also urge you chanters to start looking at raw mana items in LDoN camps or on regular bought/won gear. At 65 a good mana pool to aim for is around 5000 (pre elemental planes). This number doesn't come easy, but with those AAs you are getting in Innate Enlightenment and other main stat increases can give you around 500 more mana from 280 to 355 Int. Another great idea is to research the Flowing Thought items you can buy/quest for. Admittedly, the FT gear doesn't come easy in most cases, mostly due to the zones they drop in or the points needed from LDoN to get them. But, Everquest is known for being a time-sink, so there is no surprise. ED: The addition of OOW and DoN have opened up our ability to gain Mana Regen items and augs easier. Start looking into zones like Harbinger's SPire for the FT1 aug and the rare FT2 waist/Quest FT2 waist from that zone. DoN pretty much comes down to about 1k crystals for the augs for flowing thought and some cool effects or gear. <br /> <br />Edit... DoN has offered the enc a lot as far as gear upgrades and augs for hit points and mana that are not lore. Take advantage of these to the fullest. OOW and DoN can fire you up levels 60+ in almost one day. You biggest bottle neck post 65 will be the spells from 66-70. When you hit 69, don't be discouraged that those greater and glowing runes just don't come your way. Plug along and let those groups know you don't have important spells like the 73 level mez at 69 if you get asked for an RS grp. Most expansions coming out now have mobs in them that mitigate slow, which means that we all have to be on our game just that much more. Make sure you take steps to lowering the cast time of your slow to help the healers out with a faster recast on a resisted slow. Resisted mezzes are more common now than ever before. Might want to look into making a new hotkey that says Mezz Resisted (watch my life). At level 69-70 the DoN instance missions are filled with mobs that hit an enc for 800 and quad, mitigate slow and resists our mezzes frequently. A good target to aim for without an uber guild and gear is to hit about 7k hps buffed with cleric buffs and our shield. Our rune added to that will give us about 9k hps without shammy/bst buffs. Even with full defensive AAs and lightning AAs maxed these mobs unslowed will provide us with about a 3 attack round life span if not saved by a healer or taunter. <br /> <br />I hope this helps for anyone who takes the time to read this post <br /> <br />70 Mind Contorter <br />Server&lt;~~Does it really matter? <br /> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Mon Dec 29 00:43:31 2003 by Prostea</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sun Aug 29 19:25:17 2004 by Prostea</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sat Apr  2 16:25:05 2005 by Prostea</span></i> <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Sun Apr 17 18:58:37 2005 by Prostea</span></i></p>

<p>I would like to make 1 small addendum... <br /> <br />Assuming you can get close to maxing your INT/CHA stats, look for HP gear.  I wore Velium Fire opal rings, 6ac 65hp for 20 levels untill I recently got some rings that have even more.  It was worth losing 2-3 on int in my opinion, However my int was 240+ buffed at the time anyway.  I ran around with 2 CHA stiens for a long time, I enchanted 20 blocks of clay for a guy in exchange for them.  I finally got my gemsetters eyeglass to replace the 2 of them. <br /> <br />Great Enchanter Item <br /> <br /><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12043" title="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12043" target="akztarg">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12043</a> <br /> <br />Grandmaster Jeweler's Eyeglass <br />LORE ITEM NO DROP   <br />Weight: 0.1 Size: SMALL  <br />Slot: PRIMARY RANGE SECONDARY   <br />Str: +10 Cha: +50 Wis: +10 Int: +10   <br />Classes: All Classes   <br />Races: All Races  <br />Slot 1: Type 7  <br /> <br />Other than those small additions, great post. <br /> <br /><i><span class="sm">Edited, Tue Jan 13 16:24:17 2004 by sbs</span></i></p>

<p>Wow nice post here.  One more thing that has really been annoying me for quite sometime and it involves augs.  As you can see from my Magelo, my enchanter is wearing all the HP augs from RSS as well as LDON augs and several GoD augs.  If you notice, they are ALL HP augs.  I've seen many enchanters that have their rings/fingers, and neck/shoulder/back/waist slots filled with the mana augs from RSS.  Ummmm, pardon my french but, WTF ARE YOU THINKING?!  Like that's great and all that your mana pool is almost 10k, but for one, enchanters should NEVER even come close to being OOM, and two, when I get a mez resist, that's a total of 540 more HPs from the RSS augs, and what good is mana when you're dead eh?  And all the GoD augs, wow, grats, you have a 100 mana aug, ONCE AGAIN, what good is mana when you're dead.  Enchanters generate a lot of agro, tash/slow/mez.  They need to counter that by having HPs to be able to live through a severe beating while your resident tank attempts to get agro back.  Just my two cents, of course enchanters are still going to be rolling for the mana augs in RSS and using DKP for mana augs in GoD, but all I can say is, what a waste of time.  But, what do I know......</p>

<p>Well, you *don't* know how to speak unabrasively is what I know. Chill out. Breathe.  <br /> <br />I have a couple of mana augs handy because when soloing, which I'm normally stuck doing nowadays that I can't find a group, it helps me to be able to keep plowing for longer before I have to stop. And I DO run out of mana. All the time. I only die when I hit the last drop. Logically I want more drops. <br /> <br />Mobs hit for ten times what a 100hp aug can give me anyway at the level you're refering to. I'm not saying you're wrong that hp is important. But no matter how much hp you have yer still gonna fall like a rock. <br /> <br />Furthermore, sometimes people don't have so much of a choice what Kind of augs they get. They just roll on what's going to upgrade them. It's not a crime. You in an uberguild? Sounds like it. <br /> <br />Either way, this thread is directed more toward the little folk and their level progression. What mains choose to do with their aug slots isn't really in question with more than opinions based on personal circumstance. Bottom line, HP is generally more important because you get hit a lot. There, done. <br /> <br />Mana needs some luvin' too.</p>

<p>Great post.  I would add only... <br /> <br />In most group I would say try to be the puller.  From 30 to 50 in overthere and dreadlands xp grind groups being the puller increases xp production IMHO.  Our nukes aren't that great.  Once everyone has their buffs and you are topped of on mana go make some pulls.  This keeps the DPS busy and takes the pull lag out of the gring.  Also, this gives you a chance to debuff the mobs. <br /> <br />A typical pull consists of me tracking down a mob.  Tash it.  Run back to camp.  Mez it right next to the current mob.  Now slow the mob and mem blur.  Med until you see the xp gained message.  Wait for the mez breaks and tank has a good taunt.  Go pull another. <br /> <br />You will want to have sow and temp up.  You can use runes if you like but it's kinda wasteful.  I think pulling helps build up skills and you learn the mobs, spells and closing times of mobs.  Mainly you can get your group into an xp grove where your tanks are constantly fighting rather than poking around looking for targets. <br /> <br />Note on our pets.  I wouldn't use them until you get AA's.  They are horrible and charm works much better most of the time.  Basically if you have a pet up you can't have a charmed pet.  Charm is by far our best DPS spell bar none (may be the best in the game).   <br /> <br />Notes on charm.  If you are afraid of charming you are only half a chanter IMHO.   <br /> <br />Charm is fairly easy to learn.  Once you hit lvl 33, get a temp, a few sow potions, head to oasis and air elem form up.  See that island out in the middle of the zone.  It has the easiest lvl 35 to 37 mobs in the game for a chanter.  Go to the edge of your casting limit and tash a specter.  If you are lucky all of them will agro you.  Head toward the area behind the inn by SRo zone.  Begile the specter you tashed and sick it onto the pack.  Run a bit away and when the pet spec drops below 40 health start casting invisibility to break charm.  Target another full health specter and begile it.  Sick it on the pack.  Find the old pet and finish it off.  You will notice the old pet will come after you and flee once it gets outside the agro radius of the pack making it a simple target.  Repeat this process until only two are left.   <br /> <br />Here you just try to keep the target specs a little bit below the pet.  At 20 the target starts to flee.  You will want to root it if your pet hasn't dropped below 20 health.  Hopefully your pet will finish off the target and be below 20 health.  Invis and finish former pet. <br /> <br />I went from lvl 32 to 40 in two or three days.  Also the schythes the specters drop sell fairly well.
