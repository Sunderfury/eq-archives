<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="60%">There is a “groundswell of growing awareness”
of the need for workplace financial planning programs.&nbsp; We at Resonate,
Inc. not only know this, but also have built our benefit consulting system
on this awareness.&nbsp; This approach reinforces to employees the value
of their overall benefits program.&nbsp; Due to a better understanding
of the tools available to them, employees increase their involvement in
voluntary plan participation and enrollment.&nbsp; The process also addresses
the employer concern about future liability issues.&nbsp; We are also “independent”,
with hundreds of insurance and investment products available to us, so
our choices are driven by the needs of our clients – not a “higher master”.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD>Benefit decisions are made to enhance the overall goals and strategies
of the company.&nbsp; When reviewing benefits programs, decisions are made
from a “holistic” approach. Once employer goals, strategies and programs
are fully understood, we survey the employees as to their wishes and desires.&nbsp;
Their concerns and needs are integrated into the final direction chosen.
Employee and employer contributions are scrutinized.&nbsp; When possible,
“tax advantages” are tapped. Everything is studied and changes are made,
if necessary.&nbsp; A presentation is made back to the employees recapping
their issues and noting strategies to address.&nbsp; A systematized annual
review is outlined.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each quarter, on-going education programs
are offered.&nbsp;</TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="40%">More often than not, benefits are greatly improved.&nbsp;
Costs are stabilized for several years, and employees take more “ownership”
of their “future”.&nbsp; A powerful side benefit is that morale is substantially
improved.&nbsp; Employees appreciate and become more aware of the “value”
of their benefits, often times improving employee retention.</TD>
