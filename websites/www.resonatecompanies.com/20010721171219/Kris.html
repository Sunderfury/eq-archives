<B>Kris Arnzen</B> joined Culver-Freeman Group, Inc., a RESONATE Company
in January, 1996. She brings with her a valuable blend of experience in
the corporate business world and the life insurance industry. In the mid
1970s, Kris was employed by USM Parker-Kalon in Campbellsville, Kentucky
where she held positions in the Human Resources Department, Operations
Department and was appointed Assistant Controller just prior to returning
to Cincinnati in 1978.&nbsp;

<P>Kris returned to Cincinnati to join Kenner Products, then a division
of General Mills. Subscribing to the belief that flexibility and eagerness
were essential attributes for learning and achieving in the business world,
Kris worked in a number of areas- Purchasing, International Operations,
and&nbsp; Company Planning and Advertising- prior to becoming a member
of the Legal Department as Supervisor of Legal and Insurance Services.
The scope of this position helped Kris realize that she had a strong inclination
and interest in the areas of contracts and finance. This led her to explore
new career opportunities.&nbsp;

<P>In 1990, Kris left Kenner after 13 years to become a District Representative
for Lutheran Brotherhood, a fraternal benefit society that provides insurance,
investment products and financial planning for Lutherans. At LB, Kris qualified
in her first year for Fast Track Leaders Club honors.&nbsp;</TD>
