<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Historically, this year’s first half
was the worst first half for the S&amp;P 500 since 1970. The good news is the
S&amp;P 500 rose very strongly in the second half of 1970 because that
recession ended and the economy grew. The 1970 market environment was similar
to today because both recessions saw unemployment rise to 6% after declining
for 9 years. Today, we face a war on terrorism, but in 1970 we faced
acceleration in the Viet Nam War.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The NASDAQ was not created until 1971,
but investors had begun to become aware of it by the Crash in 1987. The
recession associated with the Gulf War of 1990-91 saw a bull market begin for
the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ in the wake of that recession, war and bear
market.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>This year, the S&amp;P 500 and the
NASDAQ have retraced to near their lows of September 2001 despite today’s
economy being better than last September’s economy. The recovery doesn’t feel
like the economic recoveries of the last 30 years despite GDP officially
growing over 6% in the first quarter, because of the temporary boosts from
government spending and unseasonably strong housing construction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>But there are many positives in this atypical
recovery that eventually should be reflected in higher stock prices. Industrial
production is rising and manufacturing activity has increased every month since
February. Unemployment declined in May and the government’s Index of Leading
Economic Indicators has risen for 7 out of the last 8 months. Inflation, other
than from health care, remains under control as the CPI is up only 1.2% over
the last reported 12 months. Inventories are low especially in relation to
sales as any increase in final demand would require an increase in production.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The Federal Reserve at its meeting in
late June did not raise interest rates, but stated that it “expects the rate of
increase of final demand to pick up over coming quarters, supported in part by
robust underlying growth in productivity, but the degree of the strengthening
remains uncertain.” This is an implicit recognition that recent growth has
slowed in the second quarter, but should reaccelerate. First Call is reporting
that corporate negative earnings preannouncements are fewer and lighter than in
previous periods, implying the economic recovery can be reflected in the EPS of
most companies being in line or better than expected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Each economic and stock market cycle
is different, but history shows how the market can overcome concerns when the
economy improves following a bear market. Every bull market has climbed a wall
of worry whether the worry was the end of a recession, a war, unemployment,
inflation, or a crisis in confidence such as Watergate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>The current market is suffering from a
crisis in confidence stemming from three things. The opinions of Wall Street
analysts influenced by investment banking relationships, the accuracy of the
accounting statements and the credibility of corporate officers and Boards of
Directors are all under clouds of suspicion. Last September, following the
emotional sell-off after the terrorist attacks, investors correctly anticipated
the economic recovery that exists today, only to see the rally be short
circuited by the current crisis in confidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Stocks rallied last fall as they had
in previous times of difficulty because the right set of policy actions were
taken to address the problems at hand. The government cut taxes and lowered
interest rates to stimulate the economy. The government mobilized to combat
terrorism. Corporations cut costs to improve profitability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Today, the right set of policy actions
are being taken to address the new problems at hand. Wall Street brokerage
houses are separating investment banking influences from an analyst’s
recommendations. CPA firms are tightening their audit process and review
function in order to retain their licenses. The internal auditors and the Board
of Directors at public companies are becoming more proactive at a time when the
government is probably going to enforce vigorously the laws against white
collar crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Investor confidence has been shaken
and may take a while to be restored fully. The risk this year has turned out to
be in the stock market, but we think the risk for the second half of this year
is to be out of the stock market.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Investor psychology is very bearish,
just as we have seen at every major stock market bottom. This time is different
a lot of people say, but it’s really the same. By the time the crisis in confidence
passes, the stock market should be significantly higher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>It is extremely difficult to fund a
retirement or pay for a child’s education with a money market return of less
than 2% or with a bond yielding less than 5%.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Long term investing says to buy low
and sell high. Prices are clearly low, but can they go lower? History has shown
that an improving economy following a bear market can overcome real concerns
and we are bullish on the economy and the stock market.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Bookman Old Style"'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>          </span>Long term investing succeeds because
long term fundamentals have more staying power than short term concerns. We
think that proven principles of successful investing are going to be proven
again to be successful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
