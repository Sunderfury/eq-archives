<CENTER><B>CLU, CFP, CEBS</B></CENTER>
<B>Donna L. Freeman</B> is co-owner of the Culver-Freeman Group, Inc.,
a RESONATE Company, in Cincinnati, Ohio.&nbsp; She began her career in
the financial services industry in 1979, and since then has directed her
energies to counseling individuals, corporations, municipalities and school
districts in the areas of insurance and investments.&nbsp;

<P>Freeman's expertise is in the corporate marketplace where today's business
owner has a full slate of financial issues to address: employee health
and welfare programs, retirement planning, key employee needs, business
continuation strategies, and individual financial challenges.&nbsp;

<P>Freeman helps the business owner coordinate and develop sound financial
solutions.&nbsp; She also works with employees of the firm, assisting them
in understanding both the company's benefit programs and steps they can
take to build their own preferred futures.&nbsp; She accomplishes this
through corporation-sponsored employee educational seminars that greatly
benefit employees and entrepreneurs.&nbsp; Freeman believes that, in today's
complicated marketplace, learning the simple basics of financial planning
is imperative if people are to establish their future security.&nbsp; Her
approach is based on commitment to a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship.</TD>
