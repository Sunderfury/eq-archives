 We are a financial planning and consulting firm dedicated to excellence in providing financial vision for our clients. Our goal is to help our clients not only define their financial life
   goals, but also develop sound creative strategies for meeting those goals. We only do "custom work"; there are no such things as a "basic model" future that will house every
client's hopes and dreams. We have expert planners in our firm who specialize in tax and cash flow analysis, to insure that dollars are not wasted, and so that incomes and outflows
  do not create cost overruns during the building process. We also have experts who can help choose and use the appropriate investments that will create the framework for your
  preferred future, and who can monitor those investments for ongoing strength and support to the structure. Finally, we have professionals who specialize in drawing the plans in
 such a way as to build a lasting legacy; a preferred future that will last for generations. With individuals specializing in many diverse areas as Philanthropic Estate Planning, Family
 Wealth Counselors, Individual Financial Planning, Corporate Insurance and benefits Packages, through to planning Business Succession and aiding Non-profit organizations, not to
 mention many others, we are able to fully assist our clients. At Resonate, Inc. formerly Culver-Freeman Group and Development Resources we handle financial planning, process
  planning, individual financial planning, including the use of mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. Our many investment strategies will maximize your portfolio. While our knowledge in
    corporate benefits, health benefits, non-profit consulting, philanthropic estate planning, planned giving, gift solicitation, fund raising, retirement planning, insurance, and donor
education will be an invaluable tool. If you seek to put aside money for your children's education, we can help plan for college costs. We provide training seminars, such as Stirrings
 of the Soul, which enable charities to maximize their contributions. If philanthropy is an area, you wish to explore we can assist in setting up trusts and donation plans that maximize
 the effectiveness of your dollar. If you need to start, understand or maximize a 401K plan you have reached the right site. Lead by our three partners consisting of Barbara Culver,
