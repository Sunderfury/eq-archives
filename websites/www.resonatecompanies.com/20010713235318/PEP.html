<TD VALIGN=TOP>While it may be true that the only certainties are death
and taxes, there are some steps that you can take to leave behind the legacy
that matters most to you.&nbsp; What really matters to you?&nbsp; Is it
family?&nbsp; Is it your church?&nbsp; Is it a social cause?&nbsp; It really
is your choice as to who should benefit from your efforts.&nbsp;

<P><B>ESTATE PLANNING</B> is often thought of as being the process of examining
your assets and choosing the methods that best transfer your assets to
the next generation with a minimal amount of expense and maximum flexibility.&nbsp;
In reality, it is so much more than just saving taxes.&nbsp; It is so much
more than just moving “stuff” from one generation to the next.&nbsp; At
Culver Freeman Group, we have experts in estate planning on staff to assist
you in choosing the option or options that best meet your specific needs.</TD>

<TD><B>PHILANTHROPIC ESTATE PLANNING</B> allows you to exercise control
over the ultimate disposition of your property.&nbsp; Should you be fortunate
enough to have a taxable estate, our society requires that some of your
wealth be shared with other citizens at you death.&nbsp; Many incorrectly
assume that this means paying a lot of taxes.&nbsp; It doesn’t have to
be this way.&nbsp; You can greatly reduce the amount that goes into Uncle
Sam’s general fund by designating the organizations or causes that matter
most to you and your family.&nbsp; Our role, as your advisor, is to work
with you to assist you in selecting the methods that best accomplish your
desires.&nbsp;</TD>
