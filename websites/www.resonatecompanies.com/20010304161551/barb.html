<CENTER><B>CFP, CLU, ChFC</B></CENTER>
<B>A principal of Resonate, Inc., Barbara A. Culver is a nationally known
 financial and estate planner, speaker, consultant, and author of numerous
  articles and the book, "Getting to the Heart of the Matter." Unlike most
   professional advisors who bring a transactional approach to planning, Barb
    distinguishes her company with transformational planning. This process
	 integrates all aspects of the clients' lives - financial, emotional,
	  social and spiritual. She then aligns who people are with what they have
	   through state-of-the-art plan design. Because Barb pioneered this "whole
	    person" approach, she is a much sought after industry speaker, serves
		 as Editor-in-Chief of the Commerce Clearing House Journal of Practical
		  Estate Planning, has appeared on CBS "this Morning", CNBC "Money Talk"
		   and National Public Radio. She has also given interviews to Money Magazine,
		    the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.

<P>Her extensive knowledge of philanthropic planning has established her
as one of this country's top professionals.&nbsp; Culver's dynamic personality
and entertaining presentation style have led to repeated national speaking
engagements with professional organizations such as the <I>International
Association of Financial Planners</I>, <I>National Association of Philanthropic 
Planners</I>, and the <I>Million Dollar Round Table</I>.&nbsp; Barb also
offers continuing education seminars for attorneys, accountants, financial
planners and non-profit professionals, as well as donor workshops.&nbsp;
