<IMG SRC="images/welmean.jpg" WIDTH=251 HEIGHT=28><I>Resonate: </I>To show or produce resonance. <I>Resonance: </I>the intensification of sound by sympathetic vibration. (Webster's New Dictionary, 1984). Our name is designed to reflect the image that the word Resonate portrays - the image of ever expanding ripples of effect on our clients' well being... "sympathetic vibrations," if you will. As ideas, thoughts, words and actions are put into place as a part of the planning we do for our clients, the effect is never-ending. As ideas travel from one family member to another, from one friend to another or from one organization to another, energy builds and something new is created - something that's bigger than, and better than what once stood alone.&nbsp;</P><IMG SRC="images/welreading.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT" HSPACE=12 WIDTH=174 HEIGHT=119>
<P><IMG SRC="images/welmakes.jpg" WIDTH=257 HEIGHT=29>The "sympathetic vibrations" we experience by partnering with our clients move our planning services beyond the current paradigm. We have created a new model which takes our clients from <I>transaction&nbsp;</I> to <I>transformation; </I>away from <I>product</I> to <I>process</I>; from compartmentalized planning to <I>comprehensive planning; </I>and shifts the focus from our client's <I>economic value - </I>to their <I>human value.</I> Our transformational team provides expert and caring "life planning," as we help link the valuation of our client's financial assets with the values of their lives.&nbsp;</P>
