          <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The discovery of trace elements took place slowly from the 1930's to the 1950's during
          the development of hydroponic or "soilless" gardening.  In hydroponic gardening,
          a plant is suspended with its roots in a nutrient solution, so that it can grow
          under ideal conditions without insects, fungi or bacteria.
          <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The hydroponic gardeners had much trouble at first, because they did not know that
          plants could not grow without the metals we now call trace elements, or "micro-
          nutrients".  As trace elements were added, the problem of identifying what was needed
          was increased because some of the metals actually dissolved off of the water pipes
          or zinc-coated buckets into the water they were using.  The gardeners did not know that
          the element was needed and the plant did not have a deficiency!
          <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            When other researchers tried to put trace elements into the soil, they encountered
          several difficulties.  First, it was difficult to control the amount the tree would get.
          Other chemicals in the soil might combine with the trace elements so the roots can't
          absorb them.  Also, rain might leach metals from the soil, and even bacteria and
          insects in the soil would absorb them.  Since trace elements are very expensive,
          adding large quantities to the soil in order to get a minute amount into the tree has
          never been practical.
          <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Researchers then tried spraying trace elements in a solution on the leaves of trees.
          This clogged up the pores of the trees and proved to be futile.
          <BR><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Robert L. Lang, inventor of Vita-Spike, hit upon the idea of injecting trace
          elements directly into the sap stream.  He achieved this by coating a regular nail
          with a carefully balanced mixture of trace elements in a water-soluble form, of the
          type normally absorbed into the roots by the trees.  This is driven into the tree
          trunk and the sap flowing past the injection device dissolves the trace elements and
          carries them off for use.  The results obtained are truly remarkable.

            Installation of a <b>Vita-Spike</b> is very simple.  It can be applied at
          any time of the year, but for best results it should be used in Fall or Winter.
          To install a spike, drill a 1/8" to 9/64" hole 1/2" into the tree trunk near the
          ground.  Then drive the <b>Vita-Spike</b> into the hole for its full length.  Apply
          one spike per 6" diameter of the trunk.
