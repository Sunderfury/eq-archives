We have a ton of stuff to add and I promise Phobus and I will get to it very very soon, but for the moment just some quick tidbits.. This last month has seen the addition of some great new family members as well as the departure of some others. Welcome to the madhouse Toffon, Qhue, Azaghal and Popeil.  Farewell to those that have moved on, we wish you the best.<br><br>  I would also like to extend congratulations to our newest married couples, Lantana and Blaisse Infyrnos and Spicie and Sekoye! <br><br>A huge pat on the back to Damean Dragonfist, one of our resident Monkees for recently making level 50, Woo hoo! <br> <br> Please notice that the older news has been moved to it's own page, it can be accessed by clicking on the News Archive link to the left.

<p><font size="2" color="#999999" face="Arial">Lot's of things have happened since the last update to this page *huge grin* nearly a month ago. I apologize to everyone for taking so long to update the news. To start off with I'd like to welcome our newest members into the guild - Kyre Valcarde, level 20 Half Elf Bard, and Illystra Valcarde, level 29 Dark Elf Cleric. Welcome to Talisman Kyre and Illystra =). I'd also like to welcome back our dear old shortie cleric Frepin who has returned to us in a new incarnation - that of a halfling rogue named Freepin =P. Cleric or rogue we're glad to have you back Freep =). Lastly, I made a reasonably large update to the roster page to more accurately reflect our current state of membership. Three and a half months later I STILL need to get screenshots of some members and newer screenshots of others. I guess I'll have to start hunting people down again.<p>I'd also like to congratulate <a href="shannow.html">Shannow</a> for acquiring a new Carmine Robe to add to his extensive wardrobe and <a href="vixyne.html">Vixyne</a> for being one of the only druids on all the servers to complete the <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=816">Test of Wolf</a> in the Plane of Sky.<br>

Welcome to Talisman! and sorry for forgetting about you last time =\. I also added a few new screenshots to the (you guessed it) screenshots section.

Welcome to Talisman! I'd also like to welcome back Xarna (shaman) and Surox (warrior) who were both dearly missed and have thankfully returned to us from another server =). Lastly, I just made a HUGE update to the roster page with some new info and lots of member pics. Be sure to check out Spicie's modeling shots and Tsai the wizard =P.<br>

We had some problems connecting to the webserver for awhile and I was finally able to connect today. First off I'd like to wish everyone a belated Happy New Year! I hope everyone's holidays were fun, festive and at least somewhat relaxing.<p>Secondly I'd like to point out a few new faces in the crowd and extend a warm welcome to Brokenarra (monk), Sekoye (paladin) and Yalara (magician). Welcome to Talisman!<br>
