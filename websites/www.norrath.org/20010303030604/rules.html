<table class=TextNormal border=0>
	<tr class=ContentHeader><td colspan=8>•Overview</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td width=30></td><td colspan=8>Whenever mobs of sufficient difficulty, as to require more than 15 Talisman members in attendance, are killed, points will be awarded to attendees that are at the kill.  Points are only awarded for successful kills. This system is in place to assure that players who devote the most to the wellbeing of the guild are rewarded for their efforts.  Raid leaders will be given a bonus of .25 points for a raid day (multiple raids in a single day do not give additional points for the leader), and they can give out up to an additional .25 points as a bonus for extraordinary effort.  The bonus would be largely available to pullers or people involved in extensive corpse recovery efforts.  </td></tr>

		<tr><td></td><td colspan=8>Whenever mobs of this caliber are killed, then their loot will be up for distribution via this lotto system.  Whenever a player enters in for an item from one of these big creatures they get as many chances to win as they have DKP’s. If a player wins an item, they lose DKP's equal to the value of the item. </td></tr>

		<tr><td></td><td colspan=8>This system is designed to limit the effect of luck, and to avoid "bad lottos." A bad lotto is when someone wins an item, and those present say, "he/she should not have won." This is the case when someone has been on dragon raid after dragon raid seeking to win one particular item, and someone new (or anyone with less time invested) shows up and wins it. This system is an attempt at solving these problems and others.</td></tr>
		
	<tr class="ContentHeader"><td colspan=8>•Tiers</td></tr>
		<tr><td></td><td colspan=8>Tiers are designed to ensure that those with more time invested win an item before those with less time invested. In theory, over time the extra chances those with more DKP's would have would win them items, but there's still the possibility that someone with a great deal of time invested will lose to someone with little time invested, which is a bad lotto.  The tiers are set up so that those with similar amounts of time invested (e.g. their DKP values are close) lotto for items, while those with significantly less DKP's are excluded.</td></tr>

		<tr><td></td><td colspan=8>When an item is dropped, those in Tier 1 are the only ones that can enter. If nobody that wants the item enters at this level, then those in the Tier 2 can enter. If nobody that wants the item enters at this level, then those in the Tier 3 can enter.  If it's no drop, then the lotto moves to Tier four, otherwise it goes to the guild treasury and is kept until the next big event. At the next event interested players can lotto for it, and lottos go through Tiers 1 through 3.</td></tr>

		<tr><td></td><td colspan=8>If, after a week or 3 events, whichever is longer, an item is still in the guild treasury, the class restrictions are removed, and anyone can enter in for the item. This means the items can be purchased with DKP's for use by an under level 51 twink.  If it is apparent that nobody will be entering in for an item, it can eventually be sold guild money to be used in the planes or for reagents such as Pierdots and Coffins.  Those that aren't present at a raid can still enter in on items, as shown in the tiers, but they pay a 50% DKP penalty. </td></tr>
			
				<tr><td></td><td width=30></td><td><span class=Textbold> Tier 1+X </span>- These tiers are special tiers, for cases when there is more than one person in Tier 1. If there is more than one person in tier 1, and one or more of them have 5 or more points over the value of the item, then a new tier is used, tier 1+5, containing only those players that have 5 or more DKP points over the value of the item. If there is still more then one, and someone has 10 points over, go to tier 1+10, then tier 1+15, 1+20, etc.</td></tr>

				<tr><td></td><td></td><td>For example, 3 players enter for a 5-point item, one with 5 points, one with 10 points, and one with 15 points. The lotto would take place at tier 1+10, and would contain only the character with 15 points. If the same lotto occurred with a 4th person with 17 points, the lotto would still be tier 1+10, and would contain both the 15 and 17 point players. </td></tr>

				<tr><td></td><td></td><td><span class=Textbold>Tier 1 </span>- Must have full positive DKP value for the item and be present. </td></tr>

				<tr><td></td><td></td><td><span class=Textbold>Tier 2 </span>- Must have half of the positive DKP value for the item and be present or have 1.5x positive DKP value and be anywhere.</td></tr>

				<tr><td></td><td></td><td><span class=Textbold>Teir 3 </span>– Must have any positive DKP and be present or have full positive DKP value and be anywhere (if won in this manner 1.5x DKP value must still be paid).</td></tr>

				<tr><td></td><td></td><td><span class=Textbold>Tier 4 </span>- This tier is only for no drop items. When it is reached, the player(s) with the least negative DKP values that want the item can enter and go further negative in standing.</td></tr>
			
		<tr><td></td><td colspan=8>If a player doesn't have enough DKP's to pay for it outright then they simply go negative. Until they have positive DKP's again they can't enter any lottos.  If an item goes through all four tiers without anyone wanting it then it will go into the guild vault.</td></tr>

	<tr class="ContentHeader"><td colspan=8>•Lotto Restrictions</td></tr>

		<tr><td></td><td colspan=8>Only those players that can actually use the item (i.e. class/race is listed on the item, with exceptions noted below for certain items) can enter the lotto. If a player has more than one character that is dragon capable (level 51+), then they can enter as any of them provided they say so before the creature dies. This is so everyone knows whom he or she'll be competing against. If someone looks around and sees only two people they'll be lottoing against, and something great drops for their class, they shouldn't have to suddenly compete with 10 others that come out of the woodwork.</td></tr>

	<tr class="ContentHeader"><td colspan=8>•After an item is won</td></tr>

		<tr><td></td><td colspan=8>Any items won through this system (except as noted above and below) can not be traded or given to a sub-level 51 secondary. However, if someone wins an item and later wins something better, they can put the old item up lotto at any DKP worthy event.  If someone wins it, they receive back DKP's equal to 3/4 the value of the item rounded to the nearest tenth of a point. Basically the winner transfers their DKP's at a penalty to the person putting up the item. Items that nobody wants can be turned in to the Guild Vault for half DKP value. If the item was won outside of our DKP system, it can be turned in to the system via lotto at the next big event, or can be turned into the Guild Vault for 1/2 value.</td></tr>

	<tr class="ContentHeader"><td colspan=8>•Guild Vault</td></tr>

		<tr><td></td><td colspan=8>Item’s in the guild vault can be withdrawn at their full value for any level 51+ primary for the first three days after being put in the vault.  If more than one person wants the item then it goes up for lotto under the rules explained before.  After three days, an item can be withdrawn at its full value for any level 51+ character.  If more than one person wants the item then it goes up for lotto under the rules explained above.  After seven days, an item can be withdrawn at its full value for any use.  If more than one person wants the item then it goes up for lotto under the rules explained above</td></tr>
