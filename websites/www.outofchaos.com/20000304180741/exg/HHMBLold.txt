. There may be a letter that has the recipe to a wedding cake and
  Drom's Champagne.
. Morning Dew can be foraged during the morning hours in any zone
  with plant life.
. Blackburrow Stout is not the same as Blackburrow Swig, nor is
  either the same as the quest item variant of Blackburrow Stout.
. Vodka is used in many other drinks, what about Frozen Toe Rum?
. Milk, it does the body good.
