		<div>Merloc is looking for input on this, so now is your chance to go wild with it.<br />
<br />
Looking for suggestions on ideas for what click effects/focus should go on the BPs in SoF.<br />
<br />
I've passed on a few suggestions already, so would be looking for things that haven't come up before. I've also seen the thread on damage clicks and passed that on, though, to be honest, that is probably something that should preferentially go on items you can use bandoleer with in the new expansion.<br />
<br />
This would be for both the raid and group acquirable robes, so different effects or upgraded effects might be good.<br />
<br />
Remember that something that fits the class is probably much more likely to be picked. And this isn't the thread for whining about other peoples suggestions, try and keep it all constructive.<br />
<br />
Something to keep in mind; These are not the Beta boards, so if it is something currently in Beta, it would be better to PM me about it directly.</div>

		<div>I'm not in beta but here goes a few ideas.  <b><u>First off I think it should have an effect that is shared with anyone I am grouped with.</u></b><br />
<br />
1) How about something like epic 2.0 clicky but for agro and longer lasting.  Click BP and everyone in group gets short term buff box effect of zero agro or almost zero agro from weapons or spell effects for say a minute or two.  Raid version is twice as long as group version.  Stackable with all.<br />
<br />
2) How about something like Intensity of the Resolute?  Click BP and everyone I am grouped with gets automatic criticals for 30 seconds on group version and one minute on raid version. <br />
<br />
3) My last idea was a mana preservation clicky effect.  Click BP for a say 50% mana pres for one minute on group version two minutes on raid version for everyone I am grouped with.<br />
<br />
All three of these I think the recast delay should be reasonably short for the group version(30 minutes?), and say 20% longer recast delay on the raid version.</div>

		<div>My first thoughts were aggro reduction over time or an instant Harvest-type effect (with a reasonable recast). However both of those are likely to be rejected due to the devs not wanting us to be &quot;married&quot; to a piece of equipment (cf. Concussion pants).<br />
<br />
I'd rather avoid group buff-type effects.</div>

		<div>First and foremost, you have no business SPEAKING for our class.  You come here and you ask for suggestions first and foremost.  You poll the community since there hasn't been an active topic about this subject for awhile aside from my one thread on EQlive.<br />
<br />
Secondly, it is incredibly insulting that you don't even bother mentioning all of these &quot;suggestions&quot; that you have passed on.  They are clearly your suggestions and yours alone.<br />
<br />
Finally, my suggestions of a clickable nuke are likely going to be the most solid there will be.  Anything that is powerful enough to be worth it will get nerfed.  Look at the necromancer Anguish BP for example.  Clickable nukes exist in FOUR expansions as wizard items and they have stood the test of time.  The tacvi timer is one that is ready to be upgraded.  A clickable Ball Lightning powered nuke (and above depending on the power boost coming in SoF) would be the most appropriate choice.    Belittle my suggestions all you want Qaman, but you know that any good wizard, and any bad raiding wizard for that matter, is carrying around their DoN clickable item if they ever had one.  Our click item should be something that benefits ourselves and ourselves only.  We are wizards, we are not utility classes.  The item needs to boost our DPS in some fashion.  Clickable nukes are the only thing that do this with enough power to remain useful for years yet not too much that they don't get yanked away from us.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I must reiterate that you do not speak FOR our class.  You speak WITH our voice and with OUR opinions.  Other classes were polled with this exact same issue several days ago and yet here you are coming to us only now.  I for one think you should also let the wizard community know just how long you've been sitting on this question without asking the community you are supposed to be gathering information from.</div>

A click that would be, a ... self-only mana flare-ish thing?  Adds damage to a couple nukes.  Would be great if it stacked with Mana Flare itself.<br />
Or a buff that sort of acts like ... bard song/damage familiar, except with a super high focus for a couple spells (all resists, that is.)</div>

Should be higher focus from each area of  Worn, AA, and Song or Spell that stack, so it is likely it wouldn't stack with what we currently have.</div>

		<div>a 2% worn crit foucs would make since. it would fit the class too since we're suppose to crit allot for casters.<br />
<br />
one thing i hope devs start straying away from for non healing casters is all the abundant focus disc buff junk. a debuff is much more useful and is the main thing currently that helps casters out in having the full spell land instead of enhancing a small portion of it when it actually does land. <br />
<br />
so given a choice<br />
<br />
2% worn crit focus 1st, ya right guess that wont happen so<br />
<br />
debuff for 4500+ nukes that helps resists and maybe does somehting like  a reverse 500 mr for 10 nukes. :)<br />
<br />
few extras<br />
edit- mini harvest would be nice too, more mana = more dps for us!<br />
<br />
Rune- although much rather it be an aa, it was on the 1st epic and never have spell gems or mana for it. <br />
<br />
Concussion- 5 min reuse<br />
<br />
huge flux staff upgrade- lets say -75 fire cold and stacks with bards HoS. no reuse however<br />
<br />
if anything just no more Focus disc buff junk. :)</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">&gt;Oh. While wrapping up my posting, forgot about Iceflame of E'ci. Would be neat to see the line continued in a click buff sort of way, being as far as I remember, it is focus from the &quot;spell&quot; area, thus not conflicting with worn or bard song? <br />
<br />
Should be higher focus from each area of  Worn, AA, and Song or Spell that stack, so it is likely it wouldn't stack with what we currently have.</div>

Most useless spell ever you get the spell at 60 and it works on lvl 60 only ice spells , i outgrew this spell in 2 days.<br />
<br />
Problem with this spell is its not useful +5 lvls later so most players never use it now if it continued to work with other lvl of spells it would be useful.</div>
