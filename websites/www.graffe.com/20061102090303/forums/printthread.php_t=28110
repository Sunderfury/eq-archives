		<div>Ok guys Im tired of being wiped by mages and beastlords pets in the bazaar arena.  <br />
<br />
I tried  what everyone advised me to do , kill pet first, but when I finally do , its owner is almost casting another one or nuking me while I lose my time with pets.  So I just prefer to root em while trying to nuke my opponent , but then the new AAs pets brings up too many trouble for us wizards .  Please how the hell do we defeat em ? remember the pets have same resists as their owners also. <br />
<br />
Our swords pet seems almost useless , just gaveme few seconds to breath and nuke em, but you know they are pretty weak. <br />
<br />
I even tried to use reflect to prevent dmgs from opponent while dealing with pets but its not everytime you can synchronize reflect with your casting and his casting time.</div>

		<div>Killing the pet is just not worth the time, just root the pet, via spell or strong root, but first use your spam stick to debuff it, so they have a harder time getting the root off. shadowstep helps in most cases with the melee classes, and the bolt spells that the mage holds, tho it won't help against a mage's shock spells, at least they can't get you with the big stuff.<br />
<br />
Since bst and mages are so reliant on pets, getting the annoyance out of the way is first. then give everything you got at the owner, and they'll fall. usually best to use FD and banes and crit them down 2k at a time, and then MB them before their pet comes free.</div>

		<div>Except that no stun of ours of any kind will ever land, and using any non lure spell in a duel is just a waste of time.  The only way we can interrupt casts is with CoX (that works really well vs. casters).  Also flux staff only affects FR and CR.  So really its all about resists.  If you manage to root the pet, use epic and frenzy and chain cast your best lure.  Or depending on how weak the mage is you can just tank the pet.  <br />
<br />
Normally even with malo you should resist most of what mages cast on you and with all of our spell shelding their nukes are quite laughable, but a bst is far more tricky since you need to be shadow steping all the time and of course they heal (though crappy it is).  <br />
<br />
Finally using MB in a duel is always a very bad idea nowdays.  I've had other wizards MB me when I was at 40% and I would lose only about 3k hp, for some reason the way it is mittigated in pvp make it really inefective.</div>

		<div>Also rememeber that most Bsts, if higher levels will have a fully buffed pocket pet ready to whip out.  If you can get the pet and master snared, then shadowstep around I think you would have your best chance.  They have magic, but not nearly as strong as Wiz.  If it comes down to that... Wiz for the win.  It won't though, the fight will be him trying to melee and get pet on you to melee, and you keeping your distance from both.  It will be more like dueling two players.  Not sure if snare can be dispelled like root, probably will though.  Dispell his pet as well.  The pets are decent dps, but if you can dispell his proc buff, and haste buff, the bst will try to keep ahead of you having them up.  These are mostly high mana cost, and long cast times ( a good time to nuke a lob a few on him).  All the higher bst proc buffs are stuns.  Keep a skin up for when the pet does get to you.  Use small nukes on the bst in the beginning.  he will think that's all you got for him, and waste his heals trying to stay 100% out of cockiness.  A smart bst won't bother trying to slow you... he knows melee from you will stink.  He will try and land a dot, and his small cold nukes, while chasing you around trying to hit.  Dispell the bst a few times... try to get his SoW off.<br />
<br />
Mages... I dont have any exp with.  Same pet powers as far as I know, stronger pet than Bst though.  Mages use toys instead of buffs like the Bst to enhance pet... not gonna have any luck getting that off.  They can also have pocket pet.  The possibility of pet swarm is there on a Mage though :(  <br />
<br />
Two diffent fights... one will be pure melee avoidance, the other will be half melee avoidance, and nuke fest.  i think Mage would be harder personally.  They have better range damage, and the threat of very strong melee coming at you if your not careful.  they also have air pets which just stun about a million times a minute.  Wouldn't want to duel either to be honest.</div>

It's been a couple years since I played on the PvP servers... so this may no longer work... but try getting a Bioluminesent Orb and spamming it on the pet until it lands, then shadow step away, then nuke him.  Never waste nukes on the pet, that's a sure way to loose.  Also, go get a dispell clicky  from Ssra or Fear, and use it to strip all his buffs, that's about your only chance.</div>

		<div>orb + Shadowstep still works well against pets.  Sequence is<br />
<br />
1. Click debuff<br />
2. Click orb till it lands (can be 5 or 6 clicks) <br />
3. Shadowstep<br />
4. Big Nuke on pet<br />
<br />
Of course this strat also works very well on players, I prefer to root the pet and do the above on the player. Very effective against pet classes. I am amazed at how often pet classes do not know, or forget how to target their pet when blinded.  If you blind the player, and then root the pet, they will never know to dispell the pet until you have landed two quick nukes on them.</div>
