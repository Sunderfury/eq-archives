Looks to me like marks and jewels are common and they drop off everything between specifc level ranges. The other items needed seem to come off rare spawns in specific zones. Usually their names are related to the items they drop.<br />
<br />
I'll update this as I get more info.</div></div><hr />

Rather rare though.  Last time I was in the tower either a Sun or a Star (can't remember which) dropped.  Also, we killed Bedlavar, and didn't get a Mark.  No idea how rare it is (didn't even know he dropped it at the time).</div></div><hr />

I got one probably out of 10 or 15 kills. Pretty sure Marks and Gems can drop from any mob of a certain level range. The other items needed drop off named spawns in the listed zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Namtik</div><div class="date">December 24th, 2001, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what are the stats on these items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarnin</div><div class="date">December 24th, 2001, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, nobody has finished the quests yet that I know of, so figuring out stats will be a while. At least until someone finished one of the quests and lets us know.<br />
<br />
The only item I've seen so far was an SK bracer, and it was about even to the PoH SK bracer. Expect the twilight armor to be just shy of planar for stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Namtik</div><div class="date">December 25th, 2001, 01:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">by looking at that chart it looks like a few pieces have been completed. so someone out there should know the stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarnin</div><div class="date">December 25th, 2001, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, just because we know where the items drop doesn't mean someone has gotten them all and turned them in yet. Like I said, no stats yet, but I'll post what I find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">etnu</div><div class="date">December 26th, 2001, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">some have been finished already (Sk bracer and a bard thing that I remember)<br />
<br />
Stats are slightly better than hate/fear armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SpooksMcgee</div><div class="date">January 2nd, 2002, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this no drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarnin</div><div class="date">January 2nd, 2002, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm gonna say no, but I haven't seen the actual item pic.

<br />
Stats are right, but it doesn't look anything like the Advisor robe. New models - Red CT robe, Old models - redder Carmine (SMR) robe<br />
<br />
&gt;Globe of Power - Mon Letalis(?), Powerfull Thoughteater<br />
<br />
Actually - Mons Letalis, Powerful Thought Horror<br />

<br />
Kind of. Scavenger minnow seems to be able to drop almost any item randomly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarnin</div><div class="date">January 29th, 2002, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These items are very sub-par. I'm not impressed with any of them, besides the robe, which I think is just ok.<br />
<br />
The staff is a joke. 2hb, decent ratio, but no wizard will use that ratio. +8 INT on an item which takes up 2 slots = very, very bad idea. You can have a Stien of moggok at like level 12, which I would use over this any day, and still have a free hand for another INT item or a weapon. <br />
When will Verant understand that we get much better stats wielding two items rather than their sub-par 2hb items? And it doesn't even have an effect! I was hoping that this would be the upgrade to the Staff of Flux that we've asked for since the Sol Ro quests were finished, and guess what? It sucks.<br />
<br />
The sandels are less than average. Sure, it's slightly difficult to find a foot slot item with INT on it around the level you'd be doing these quests, but the stats aren't that impressive at all.<br />
<br />
The gloves are very sub-par. There are so many better gloves out there available at 10 levels less than required to do these quests, it's disgusting. Imp Skin gloves drop in Sol A, and you can get them at level 30ish with a small group. Dusty Bloodstained gloves are going for 25pp on my server, and I'd wear those over the gloves of detonation.<br />
<br />
So, if Verant thinks these items are better than the solusek Ro items, they're insane. There are more of them, sure, but the overall stats are quite low compared to what you can loot at these levels. Once again, nice job at showing us what Everquest means; Quest for what seems like forever, and you'll recieve an item which is worth less than what you can buy or loot from a MoB that you kill in a few hours.<br />
<br />
If you're doing these quests already, I'm not going to tell you to stop. Just look at the items already found, and ask yourself if you'd use them.</div></div><hr />
