			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Europe gets it November 30th. Surprisingly, we both get it before Japan (I think it was speculated Japan would get it this year, everyone else in the next), who gets it in December.<br />
<br />
Not sure how old the news is, I haven't been keeping current with gaming websites lately, and am getting this information from wikipedia.<br />
<br />
Here is a list of the stated launch titles:<br />

ZombiU 	</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Not a terrible list in all honesty. Not a great one either. The Wii U has taken flak for focusing on ports of year + old games, but it has a few new multiplatform titles as well. That isn't enough to convince anyone to go out and buy one though, when they already have a 360 or PS3.<br />
<br />
As it stands, the Wii U is basically the ZombiU machine. How does that make you feel about getting one at launch? I've seen a bit of new hype for this game, but haven't been paying too much attention lately.<br />
<br />
As for pricing, it apparently comes in two bundles: A basic bundle for $300, which comes with 8GB of storage, a gamepad, hdmi cable, and sensor bar. And a &quot;premium&quot; bundle for $350, with 32GB of storage, the Nintendo Land game, stands for the console and controller, and a &quot;Nintendo network premium subscription&quot;, whatever that is.<br />
<br />
Price seems to be $50 over what it should be, for both bundles. The bundles seem to have a bit of mixed marketing confusion as well. The people who are going to want a cheaper deal are more likely to want that game, whereas the people who will want that extra storage won't care for it. So strange. Put Nintendo Land in the basic bundle and ZombiU in the premium bundle, and watch your sales skyrocket.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's probably too late to preorder anyway, sorry about that. I blame Guild Wars 2.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A few days ago, I was being lazy and waiting for someone else to make the thread. :p<br />
<br />
I don't know much about it, all I've seen so far is that they are claiming to have listened to complaints surrounding the second game and intend to address what people did not like about it. <br />
<br />
Wiki claims the game will take place in Orlais, and revolve around a civil war between mages and templar. The game will feature a new protagonist.<br />
<br />
I've seen it mentioned that two of the Bioware teams are working on it, but with the way EA whores out that name lately I've got no idea what that even means. I still retain the right to hope that the game will be competent, at the least.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh right, and it is going to be using the Frostbite 2 engine, which seems to be the go to engine for EA lately. This is the engine that was developed for Battlefield, and allows for destructive environments.</div>

Available for purchase from: Website (includes a Steam key) for Win/Mac/Linux, Steam for Win/Mac, or GoG for Windows only, I think.<br />
Price: $10, 10% off for the launch weekend (for the math-challenged, that's $9).<br />
<br />
This is a snazzy game with an interesting history. The developers (2 guys) decided to use the brand-new (at the time) Kickstarter website to fund the last quarter of their game. They asked for a modest amount - I think like $10k? - but received a massive amount more - like $250k? They did not expand the game, except to add high-quality music. The graphics became more refined, and they had the budget to polish a lot more of the features than their original expectation. The beta was resounding, and Tycho from Penny-Arcade gave <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/2012/09/14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a great review here</a>. (Also, see the <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/two-men-200000-and-a-successful-kickstarter-how-ftl-did-everything-right" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PAR</a>.)<br />
<br />
I bought the game yesterday (Friday, launch day), and I've enjoyed it immensely. It really is the mix of Star Trek and Star Control I/II that I was hoping for. Easy to access, lots of replayability, but still challenging and intuitive.<br />
<br />
The price is right, DRM is absent, and these guys are serious about continuing to make games in this vein. Check it out, support this type of awesome game development!</div>

I've never streamed anything, but I'm interested in helping new players learn to play DF. So, I've started streaming live as I play DF. I'm discussing, step by step, what I'm doing and why, and addressing the concerns that a new fortress undergoes. It's not structured except by chronology, and I've never streamed anything before, so I'm sure it's a little rough around the edges, but if you're curious, head on over and take a look. I'll answer any questions you guys have, whether here or at the reddit thread.<br />
<br />
I will say that I'm not sure I could do this for more than about four hours, though - my throat is tired.</div>

			Fans resurrect Half-Life video game The blocky graphics of the original game are getting an overhaul with the updated version Continue reading the main story <br />
Related Stories<br />
Valve: Windows 8 a 'catastrophe' <br />
Half-Life lives all over again <br />
Half Life 2 dominates game awards <br />
<br />
After eight years of work, fans are about to release an updated and expanded version of classic video game Half-Life.<br />
<br />
Called Black Mesa, the resurrected game will be made available as a free download on 14 September.<br />
<br />
The update has been put together using programming tools released by Half-Life creator Valve.<br />
<br />
It will have improved graphics, better physics and environmental effects and a tweaked story line.<br />
<br />
News about the long-awaited update broke at the weekend when a countdown timer appeared on the Black Mesa project webpage.<br />
<br />
A forum message posted soon after revealed that eager players would not get an improved version of the entire game on 14 September.<br />
<br />
Carlos Montero, leader of the 40-strong Black Mesa development team, said it decided to release a shorter version instead of making people wait longer for the whole thing. <br />
<br />
Alien intrusion<br />
 <br />
The large chunk of Half-Life that is finished lets players guide hero Gordon Freeman to a section of the original gameplay known as Lambda Core. Finishing this first chunk should take players between eight to 10 hours.<br />
<br />
The final section yet to be finished takes place in the alien Xen dimension. An expanded Xen section would be released at an unnamed date in the future, said the team.<br />
<br />
First person shooter Half-Life was released in 1998 and gave players the task of guiding government scientist Gordon Freeman through the Black Mesa research complex battling aliens and thwarting their attempt to invade Earth. The game has been hugely influential since its release.<br />
<br />
Half-Life creator Valve released an updated version of the game in 2004 that was built around its Source game code or engine. That official update of Half-Life was generally regarded as unsatisfactory and led to the Black Mesa project which aimed to do a better job.<br />
<br />
The project uses an updated version of Source which leads to improvements in physics, lighting and allows for far more subtlety in the facial expressions of characters. <br />
<br />
The Black Mesa team has also edited the storyline to beef up the more engaging parts of the game and eliminate the slower parts.
