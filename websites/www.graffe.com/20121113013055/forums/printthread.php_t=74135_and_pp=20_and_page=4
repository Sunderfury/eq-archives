<br />
The question of accuracy on 10 or 100 feet to me is more a matter of, was it close enough that you could find the place?  We are after all talking about a free map.  Remember that before google you had to pay, quite alot, for even that basic access. Especially in a gps driving situation.<br />
<br />
Let's also not forget that google isnt always accurate either.  When you get to less populated areas many of their addresses are geo-located (meaning approximation), not hand placed.  I've seen some addresses more than half a mile from where they should be before.<br />
<br />
Don't think I'm defending the actual apple app.  It's clearly not as useful when it comes to points of interest.  But many of those complaints in the links posted were about a park being named wrong or a 3d rendering of a road going under a bridge not rendering properly.  These are minor things that do not impact end result and primary purpose of the app.  And it's silly to point to them and go &quot;omg apple is so stupid&quot;.  These are clearly things apple moved down the priority list in order to meet a launch date.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm glad apple is doing it's own map thing.  In the long run it could lead to more innovation with increased competition.  The day google maps is the only option in town is the day they stop innovating it.</blockquote>

</div>In consumer technology over the past 15 years, I can think of a few things off the top of my head where a newcomer immediately blew away its predecessors in terms of quality: Google search engine; Gmail; Google Maps; iPod; Chrome browser. If anything, I expect any highly touted new product to be better than its predecessors. No reason for a new gizmo if it's worse than the old one.<br />
<br />
In any case, this isn't a case of Apple providing Google competition in the near term. Right now now you can't get a Google app on the iPhone, so there is no competition, at least in a meaningful way, since so many customers are locked into contracts with their providers, so going out to buy an Android phone would not be feasible in the immediate future.</blockquote>

<br />
You do have a decent point PPatty about new products.  But I think it's a not a blanket statement you can make in either direction.  Especially in the case of maps which is very data centric.  There is no amount of gloss and polish that can compete with literally years of data collection and refinement that google has done.  So apple was left with really no other option but to release the best maps app they could and hope for the best.  I'm guessing that they expect their users to forget all about this in a few months time and it wont matter anymore.</blockquote>

</div>Well, in a few months time Google will have released iOS apps to replace the lost functionality making this decision no-win for Apple. A walled garden is only good as long as you make good decisions. Keep making bad ones like this and people will find no benefit to being in the shackles.<br />
<br />
I don't care if Microsoft or Yahoo or anyone else want to invest in search engines. If they fail I can keep using Google and if they succeed I can jump ship. It's win-win because the competition will ensure Google stay at the top of their game. It's the same with mapping: It's good if there are two or more world-class mapping services. They will spur each other on. The mistake isn't in Apple launching a rival service, it's in making its service the default one while it is still ridiculously inferior. All they had to do was wait a few years and invest some more of the $100Bn cashpile they're sitting on, like PPatty says. They <i>ought</i> to take pride in their services - and if they're not thoroughly ashamed of this one then that makes things even worse.<br />
<br />
This wasn't a business decision, it was one based on bad blood - and the ones who suffer for that are Apple's users and, ultimately, Apple themselves.</blockquote>

</div>That's true but it doesn't really change anything. If Apple partner with Tomtom and together they create a mapping service as good as or better than Google maps that's win-win for everyone but Google. <br />
<br />
Tomtom should be embarrassed by this too, though, and it won't have done their reputation any good either. All the stuff about missing towns and wrong one-way streets and such must be down to them. I have a Tomtom satnav and if I replaced it I'd attempt to go to a rival now (do Google licence their maps to a satnav manufacturer?) <br />
<br />
The incorrect geography isn't the worst of it, though. Tomtom are attempting to distance themselves from the row by saying they only provide basic raw data and it's up to the likes of Apple to add the 'value-added' data that is what makes Google's product so ground-breaking - ie the mass of data on local businesses and services etc. That's what cost Google the big bucks to build up, and that's what Apple should have spent a few years acquiring before the big launch.<br />
<br />
It's kind of like when we used to argue about new MMORPGs - and person A would say 'game X is crap because it lacks features 1,2 &amp; 3', and person B would say 'EQ didn't have features 1,2 &amp; 3 at launch, and game X is much better than EQ was at launch', and person A retorts 'there's no point comparing to what EQ was at launch, I'm not playing EQ at launch, I'm playing it as it is now, and it <i>does </i>have features 1, 2 &amp; 3'<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if Apple's mapping is better than Google's was at launch (if that's even true), all that matters is how it compares now. And right now it compares extremely badly. Which wouldn't be a problem if Apple hadn't made it one by removing Google's mapping from their devices. It'd be like if Microsoft had removed Google searching from its browsers and made everyone use Bing. People would kick up a fuss just the same...</blockquote>

edit: looking at the app store they have relaxed the rule, but at this point I think it's more of a programming restriction than a rule.  Since iOS does not let you run background processes or hook into core iOS functions.  So while you can find email, browser and music player apps, you will not find sms or keyboard apps.<br />
<br />
If they continue with those rules there's nothing preventing google from releasing their maps as a stand alone app.</blockquote>

			<div class="message">You do not need to change the function of the UI to change it's graphics.  Windows is a clear example of this (if you ignore 8).  The basic interface has not changed from xp to vista to 7, but the graphics were updated and the ui has mostly kept with the times.  Even 8, if you disable the metro stuff, is basically an updated version of 7's graphics.<br />

Android last year updated to ICS, and while this is more like a vista upgrade in the fact there's alot of rewrite, the basic functionality is very similar to previous versions.  But the updated graphics make it look much better.</div>

</div>I would argue that a lot of the UI changes did not add increased function and that as a result the user received nothing in exchange for the resources allocated for the glitter.  On OS X when ui animations existed it was largely a different way of presenting information, such as what windows were opened etc.  Windows 7 was worth switching to just for the quick window resizing though if nothing else, and that was one of the first things I implemented in compiz.</blockquote>

</div>Well, a corollary to the map situation now would be if Apple partnered with Vimeo and put a Vimeo app on the phone by default.  It occurs to me while reading these posts that while Apple is great at OS/Hardware integration, they are really bad at services. Aside from the iTunes/App store, all of Apple's services have been failures (Ping, MobileMe, etc.)  Google on the other hand has the opposite problem.  Google has really great services (GMail, Google Drive, Search, Google+, etc.) but sucks at integrating them all well.</blockquote>

			<div class="message">It occurs to me while reading these posts that while Apple is great at OS/Hardware integration, they are really bad at services. Aside from the iTunes/App store, all of Apple's services have been failures (Ping, MobileMe, etc.)  Google on the other hand has the opposite problem.  Google has really great services (GMail, Google Drive, Search, Google+, etc.) but sucks at integrating them all well.</div>

</div>Yeah. Apple and Google working together would be a dream.<br />
<br />
Except them cooperating would make them both much more powerful, which might end up a nightmare!</blockquote>

			<div class="message">IOW, they'd need some credible, objective reason to deny Google approval and not simply 'we don't like Google', else they'd start suffering lawsuits - if not in America then elsewhere.</div>

</div>You would think so, but supposedly Apple has been denying the Google voice app for nearly a year now.  I don't think they outright deny the app, they just keep nitpicking it and finding reasons to not approve it.</blockquote>
