			Armed white supremacists have planned anti-Muslim protests outside 28 mosques across the U.S. on Oct. 9 and 10.<br />
  <br />
The protests are known as the “Global Rally for Humanity.” Jon Ritzheimer, who organized a similar rally at a mosque in Phoenix, Arizona, last May, said in a video posted to Facebook about the demonstrations: “I’m going to tell everyone to follow your Second Amendment rights in case we get attacked out there.” The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution supports the right to bear arms.<br />
 <br />
“Followers of this enemy all have one thing in common; they read the Koran,” stated Ritzheimer on the video. The white supremacist is then shown shooting a copy of the Koran.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to travel: go to any mosque, any Muslim establishment, any CAIR – Center for American Islamic Relations – office, and voice your opinion there,” said Ritzheimer, a proclaimed atheist.<br />
<br />
At the Phoenix rally, protestors wore t-shirts bearing Nazi slogans and carried weapons.<br />
<br />
The Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the Justice Department held an “Incident Community Coordination Team” call Oct. 6 with Muslim American community leaders to discuss the hate rallies. DHS has urged the community to contact law enforcement immediately if they believe they are being targeted for a possible hate crime or other forms of violence.<br />
<br />
Ibrahim Hooper, national communications director for CAIR, told India-West that law enforcement would only be able to intervene if there is a probable cause for violence. Holding a sign with hateful rhetoric is protected by the First Amendment, he noted. “They have the right to stand out there and be idiots,” he stated, adding, however: “If someone is holding an assault rifle and threatening people as they enter a mosque, law enforcement will intervene.”<br />
<br />
Hooper said he is hoping the planned demonstrations will simply fizzle out or include just a few people. CAIR is not asking Muslim Americans to stay home this weekend but is encouraging people to be extra cautious, said Hooper.<br />
<br />
The organization is asking administrators at mosques to ask local law enforcement for extra protection if a rally is planned in their area. CAIR is also warning people not to engage with the protestors or challenge their rhetoric.<br />
<br />
The Sikh Coalition has also urged Sikh Americans to take precautions, noting that backlash against Muslims often results in violence against Sikhs because of the mistaken belief that Sikhs are Muslims.<br />
<br />
“We ask the Sikh American community to exercise caution and vigilance during this time. We know our community and other religious minorities are vulnerable to backlash, hate crimes and discrimination following rallies like those scheduled for today and this weekend,” said Arjun Singh, the Sikh Coalition’s Director of Law &amp; Policy, in a press statement.<br />
<br />
“These rallies are intended to intimidate innocent Muslim Americans and are symptomatic of a much deeper problem: pervasive prejudice against Muslim, Arab, Sikh and South Asian Americans,” said Singh. “While we support free speech, we condemn these hateful actions, which aim to threaten the safety of religious minorities and divide us as a nation,” he said.<br />

		<hr />
		
			In Washington, Republicans are rudderless after their candidate to lead the House of Representatives drops out. On the campaign trail, seasoned conservatives struggle in the presidential race while a reality TV star alienates the nation's fastest-growing slice of the electorate.<br />
<br />
Since 2010, Republicans have harnessed the anti-establishment energy of the Tea Party movement to win control of Congress and recruit a deep field of candidates for the November 2016 presidential election. <br />
<br />
Now that insurgent fervor threatens the party's ability to govern effectively and win over new voters, strategists warn. While many Americans share Republicans' skepticism of government, they also need to show they are capable of handling power responsibly - or else face punishment from voters next year.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think conservatives are in real danger,&quot; said David Bozell, president of the conservative advocacy group For America. &quot;They kind of caught the dog by the tail and they didn't know what to do next.&quot;<br />
<br />
Short-term, Republicans will have to solve a leadership vacuum in Congress ahead of difficult votes on the debt limit and the budget. <br />
<br />
It is not clear who will be in charge. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy suddenly dropped out the race to succeed retiring Speaker John Boehner on Thursday, saying he was unable to unite moderates and conservatives who have clashed repeatedly over tactics.<br />
<br />
Like Boehner, McCarthy faced skepticism from a group of 40 or so Tea Party lawmakers in the Freedom Caucus who viewed him as too willing to compromise with Democratic President Barack Obama.<br />
 <br />
It was a surprising fall for McCarthy, who had been quickly amassing power amid Tea Party successes.<br />
<br />
Boehner has not shied from confrontation with the White House. He led a white-knuckle showdown over the debt ceiling in 2011 that nearly led to a government default and presided over a 16-day federal shutdown in 2013. Republican approval ratings plunged after both events.<br />
<br />
But he has also been forced to rely on Democratic votes at times due to conservatives' refusal to compromise. <br />
 <br />
Republicans say that while conservative icons such as Ronald Reagan often settled for compromises that advanced his goals, ideological fervor has blinded new lawmakers to the incremental reality of governing in Washington.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've elected an entire generation of members who have little idea how to actually run the Congress they preside over,&quot; said Joe Brettell, a Republican strategist and former House staffer. &quot;They are out of ideas, out of candidates and soon, they will be out of time with voters,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Conservative activists say the party will settle on a successor who will be more willing to take the fight to Obama.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't force the president to the negotiating table if you keep capitulating,&quot; said Adam Brandon, the head of FreedomWorks, a grassroots Tea Party group closely aligned with the Freedom Caucus.<br />
 <br />
That anti-establishment sentiment has also shaped the campaign trail this year, as political neophytes such as real-estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump and retired surgeon Ben Carson outpace more experienced candidates like former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the early pick of wealthy donors.<br />
<br />
Party strategists worry their unvarnished criticism of Muslims and Hispanic immigrants could complicate the eventual nominee's efforts to expand the party beyond its base of aging white voters.<br />
<br />
<b>If Republicans have one factor working in their favor, it is the short memories of American voters, who blamed the party for the government shutdown in 2013, only to hand them control of the Senate a year later.</b><br />
<br />
&quot;It's going to require the party to do some fixing, but there is some time,&quot; said John Feehery, a former House leadership aide who now works as a Republican strategist.

I listen to amateur erotic audio a lot and they will make your ears bleed when they are rather enthralled so I have tried out a few different tools that limit or normalize volume, which is especially helpful when wearing headphones. <br />
<br />
Here is one that is cross platform and free that works pretty well: <a href="http://loudmax.blogspot.ru" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://loudmax.blogspot.ru</a><br />
<br />
Not sure why Apple has not included such software as they make audio software so this is a pretty trivial solution in comparison.<br />
<br />
There is also Boom 2 on the App Store, but it is OS X only. Out of the paid solutions I think it is the easiest to use. Its GUI is pretty decent. <br />
<br />
VLC includes the ability to normalize audio and works the best I think but it can't hook into a web browser's audio.</div>

			A 22-year-old Connecticut man who took part in bomb threats made against two Monmouth County schools last year was Tuesday sentenced to a year in prison.<br />
<br />
The prison term for Matthew Tollis takes into account his role in the New Jersey &quot;swatting&quot; incidents as well as similar threats in Texas, Massachusetts and his home state, the U.S. Attorney's Office for Connecticut said in a news release.<br />
<br />
In the Jan. 14, 2014 incident, a caller said there was a bomb inside St. John Vianney High School in Holmdel. After the school was evacuated and swept, authorities called the threat a hoax.<br />
<br />
The following day, someone called in a similar threat to Allentown High School in Upper Freehold. Once again, a search revealed there was no bomb.<br />
<br />
Tollis was part of a group consisting primarily of X-Box gamers who referred to themselves as &quot;TCOD&quot; (TeAM CrucifiX or Die). <br />
<br />
The Wethersfield resident also collected information in relations to threats made against the University of Connecticut, the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, Boston University and a high school in Texas, authorities said.<br />
<br />
Tollis pleaded guilty to conspiring to engage in the malicious conveying of false information on June 23. He remains free on bail and is scheduled to turn himself in on Nov. 15.<br />
<br />
After completing his prison term, Tollis will also serve three years of supervised release and perform 300 hours of community service.

			NORTH PORT, Fla. — The families of three high school students who died after being hypnotized by a former principal will receive $200,000 each from the Sarasota County School District under a settlement agreement unanimously approved by the School Board on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
The Herald-Tribune reports that the $600,000 settlement closes a bizarre, yearslong case that began after former North Port High School Principal George Kenney admitted that he hypnotized 16-year-old Wesley McKinley a day before the teenager killed himself in April 2011.<br />
<br />
A subsequent investigation found that Kenney hypnotized as many as 75 students, staff members and others from 2006 until McKinley’s death. One basketball player at the school said Kenney hypnotized him 30 to 40 times to improve his concentration.<br />
<br />
Among those who were hypnotized were 17-year-old Brittany Palumbo and 16-year-old Marcus Freeman. Palumbo killed herself in 2011. Freeman was in a fatal car crash after apparently self-hypnotizing, a technique Kenney taught the teenager, also in 2011.<br />
<br />
School Board Attorney Art Hardy said after the board approved the agreement on a 4-0 vote that members were “just happy to put this behind them.”<br />
<br />
Damian Mallard, an attorney representing the families of McKinley, Palumbo and Freeman, said the parents did not sue for money but to hold the school district accountable and to ensure something similar does not happen again.<br />
<br />
“It’s something they will never get over. It’s probably the worst loss that can happen to a parent is to lose a child, especially needlessly because you had someone who decided to perform medical services on kids without a license,” Mallard said. “He altered the underdeveloped brains of teenagers, and they all ended up dead because of it.”<br />
<br />
Mallard said the families and the district reached a settlement agreement Oct. 1 as the case was nearing a trial.<br />
<br />
Kenney was placed on administrative leave in May 2011; he resigned in June 2012. He was charged with two misdemeanors in 2012, including practicing therapeutic hypnosis without a license. He entered a plea of no contest as part of a deal that saw him serve one year of probation, during which he was not allowed to practice unlicensed hypnosis.<br />
<br />
Kenney gave up his teaching license in 2013 under pressure from the Florida Department of Education and cannot reapply for another.<br />
<br />
“They’re not happy about” Kenney’s lack of punishment, Mallard said of the students’ families. “The thing that is the most disappointing to them is he never apologized, never admitted wrongdoing and is now living comfortably in retirement in North Carolina with his pension.”<br />
<br />
The families could not sue Kenney himself because school district employees are considered an extension of the School Board under the law. The only entity families could sue was the school district.<br />
<br />
Mallard noted that the $200,000 awarded to each family is the maximum any Florida government agency can pay without getting special approval from the Legislature and governor.

In today’s world, all the tools are in place to allow a government to do just that in stunningly subtle yet powerful ways, and the Chinese government appears to be wasting no time in exploiting that potential to the fullest.<br />
<br />
The United States is a much different place than China, and the chances that our government will explicitly launch this kind of a program any time in the near future is nil, but there are consistent gravitational pulls toward this kind of behavior on the part of many public and private U.S. bureaucracies, and a very real danger that many of the dynamics we see in the Chinese system will emerge here over time. On the government side, for example I have written about how the TSA’s airline passenger “whitelist” system could evolve in this direction. In the private sector, Frank Pasquale notes that elements of its judgment-and-reward system already exist in the U.S. private-sector credit scoring infrastructure.</div>

			MSNBC reported Tuesday morning that aides to Donald Trump estimate that the real estate mogul has spent roughly $2 million on his 2016 presidential campaign to date. That's consistent with a Wall Street Journal report from over the summer that Trump had loaned his campaign $1.8 million and raised another $100,000 for the effort.<br />
<br />
That's stunning. And brilliant.<br />
<br />
Trump has been the dominant force in the Republican presidential race for, at least, the past four months. (He officially became a candidate June 16.)  On any given Sunday, he is appearing on or phoning into some -- if not all -- of the Sunday talk shows. According to Facebook's new Signal interface, Trump is responsible for 80 percent (or more) of the conversation around the 2016 presidential race on any given day. The first two Republican debates netted 24 million and 23 million viewers, respectively -- totals that Trump, rightly, attributes to his presence in the race.<br />
<br />
All of that attention has catapulted Trump to the top of virtually every national and early-state poll released in the last few months -- all without Trump ever having to dip into his pocket in any meaningful way. (For someone who is a billionaire, which Trump definitely is, $2 million is roughly the income hit of me buying a pumpkin spice latte.) Remember that Trump, as recently as August, pledged that he would spend as much as $1 billion of his own money on the campaign; &quot;I make $400 million a year, so what difference does it make,&quot; he said in response to reporters' questions at the Iowa State Fair.<br />
<br />
Trump is the living, breathing example of publicity that you just can't buy. And, to his credit, he's acknowledged as much. Trump told the New York Times last month that he had planned to spend $15 million on campaign ads over the summer but decided not to since he was getting wall-to-wall media coverage without spending a dime. &quot;I&#8217;ve gotten so much free advertising, it&#8217;s like nothing I&#8217;d have expected,&#8221; he told the Times. &#8220;When you look at cable television, a lot of the programs are 100 percent Trump, so why would you need more Trump during the commercial breaks?&#8221;<br />
<br />
He's right. Take Tuesday. He started his day doing an interview on CNN's morning show and will close it with a sitdown with Fox News's Bret Baier. The guy is a media-appearance machine.<br />
The fact that Trump felt the need to spend only $2 million to date will reinforce the idea, rampant among the frustrated Republican establishment, that the media is Trump's best friend and is largely responsible for his rise. I've written before on why I think that misses the mark and robs Trump of some of the credit he deserves for assessing the political-media landscape and capitalizing on it. (Make sure to read the counter-argument on the media's role in Trump's rise by my colleague John Sides here.)<br />
<br />
What's clear is that Trump is playing the game better than anyone else at this point. Is he gaming a political system that prefers simple answers to complex ones and a media world that puts ratings and clicks at the top of its priority list? Absolutely. But, that's the brilliance of Trump's campaign to date. He's recognized that as a celebrity with a massive following on Instagram and Twitter, he can dominate the political conversation without spending any real money in the process.<br />
<br />
Will Trump be able to continue to float above the GOP crowd on free publicity alone? Maybe not. But did you think he would have made it this far by spending only $2 million? Me neither.

			ABC Family is changing its name. <br />
<br />
The Disney-owned cable channel is undergoing a moniker rebranding that ditches “Family” — a word that’s been part of the network’s identity for nearly 30 years across several previous name changes.<br />
<br />
<b>Starting in January, ABC Family will be known as Freeform. </b><br />
<br />
The switch is part of an effort to attract more of what the network calls “Becomers,” viewers between the ages of 14 and 34. <br />
<br />
The network’s programming style — led by shows like Pretty Little Liars, The Fosters, and Young and Hungry — will essentially remain the the same. <br />
<br />
“For us, this doesn’t feel like a radical depature, this is an evolution,” ABC Family president Tom Ascheim explained to EW. “For the last 10-to-12 years, we’ve been targeting young people, Millennnials, and then something happened. Millennials started getting older. The oldest ones are nearly 40. So do we follow Millennials or stay with the ‘life stage’ that got us here?”<br />
<br />
The network’s executives decided remain focused on telling stories capturing viewers who were “navigating the wonderful, fun, exciting, and scary time in life when you experience the most firsts – first car, first apartment, first job, first love, first heartbreak – all the firsts that exists between who they are and who they want to become.” <br />
<br />
The team polled cable viewers and found ABC Family fans had several positive associations with the channel, but target-demo viewers who did not watch the network were put off by the name. In particular, the word “Family,” which they associated with “family friendly” and “wholesome,” Ascheim said.<br />
<br />
“That’s the nub of why we’re changing our name,” Ascheim said. “Like any growing business, we want to keep our core customers satisfied, but also add new ones – and they had a cliched sense of who we are. The word ‘Family’ sounds overly loud to their ears and that makes it a barrier to them coming into our ecosystem.” <br />
<br />
In researching a new name, Freeform accomplishes a few different goals the network was striving to hit. The name suggested content that could be viewed on different screens and shared and discussed in multiple ways (ABC Family viewers are big on social media). That viewers no longer just consume content but create it as well was a consideration too. And Freeform, ultimately, was a name that simply generated a positve emotion. “We wanted an emotional response to a name that made people happy,” Ascheim said. “We got an overwhelmingly positive response. Freeform sounds like fun.” <br />
<br />
ABC Family was originally launched as CBN Satallite Service in 1977, then rebranded as CBN Family Channel in 1988. For awhile it changed to The Family Channel, then to Fox Family Channel, and then in 2001 became ABC Family Channel. Watch the ABC Freeform announcement video below.

			Disneyland has hiked rates for its annual passes, a spokeswoman said on Monday, putting some prices above $1,000 for the first time as the Southern California theme park owned by Walt Disney Co cashes in on growing demand during peak seasons. <br />
<br />
One daily pass was discontinued while two costlier options were added on Sunday, a move that provoked frustration across social media with some fans saying they would not renew at higher rates.   <br />
<br />
Suzi Brown, Disneyland Resort’s director of media relations, said the international tourist attraction generally raises ticket prices once a year. <br />
<br />
The new annual passes &quot;will help us manage strong demand and continue to deliver a world-class experience, while providing more choices for guests to select the pass that best meets their needs”, Brown said in a statement. <br />
<br />
One of the new passes is similar to the discontinued option in offering year-round access, but costs $270 extra for a total of $1,049, with limited extra benefits.<br />
 <br />
The other new pass costs $849 a year with two weeks of blackout dates during the winter holidays. Brown said the option is geared for Southern California locals, who comprise the majority of pass-holders and are easily able to visit at other, less-crowded, times of the year. <br />
<br />
Individual tickets cost $99, and were last raised by $3 in February. The figure had steadily grown since its $50 price tag about 10 years ago. <br />
 <br />
Some Disneyland-goers expressed concern that the price hikes could deter low-income families. <br />
<br />
“It is starting to be only for the wealthy and that is not what Walt would have wanted,” wrote Nancy Nicastro Jonas on a Facebook group for Disneyland fans.<br />
<br />
But others defended the 60-year-old theme park located in Anaheim, saying higher prices could help cut down on oppressive overcrowding. <br />
 <br />
Walt Disney Co said in August that it would add a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed land to Disneyland, at a date that has not yet been announced, which could attract even more people.<br />
<br />
Brown said she could not disclose the number of people who hold Disneyland passes, but said the figure has grown by 250 percent since the adjacent California Adventure theme park opened in 2001.
