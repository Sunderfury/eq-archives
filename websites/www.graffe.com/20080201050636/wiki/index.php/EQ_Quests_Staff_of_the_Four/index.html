<p>This quest is started by talking to Solomen within the Temple of Solusek Ro. Solomen is a human wizard located on the left portion of the temple, third floor, between the two undead knights, one room away from Lord Seafire. The end result of the quest is not known, but it is thought to be a blunt scepter type weapon with fantastic stats as well as unique particle effects whenheld. 
</p><p><span style="color:red">You say, 'hail Solomen'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Solomen says 'Ah, I see you have found my study. This is where I study and scribe the history of magic in Norrath.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:red">You say, 'what history?'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Solomen says 'I have worked to chronicle everything from the beginnings of magic to what we consider the modern day of magic. Solusek Ro has been very generous to those who wield magic in Norrath. But throughout history there is one thing I have noticed - too much power corrupts the soul. I have seen and documented that the strongest wizards and those closest to Solusek Ro become corrupted by their power.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:red">You say, 'what wizards?'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Solomen says 'Unfortunately, I don't have time to speak of such things right now. But I could use your help since you are here. I have here an envelope that I need delivered to one Camin Rah. You can find Camin in the wizard tower in the city of Erudin. He is a sage like myself whose knowledge rivals my own. Do you [agree] to undertake my task?</span>
</p><p><span style="color:red">You say, 'I agree.'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Solomen says 'Here you are, then. Good luck on your journey.</span>

<p>Camin can be found at the Vasty Deep Inn within Erudin. To find him inside the Inn, open the front door to the Inn and go up the stairs on your right. Follow the hallway around the second floor and Camin is found behind the first door upon your left. Off the bat, he is normally indifferent or apprehensive to everyone. Hand him the note that was given to you by Soloman and you will receive positive TrueSpirit faction. (Note: Since the patch on 10/03/00, you can no longer keep handing Camin the note and gain faction.. it has been nerfed)
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Camin says, 'So you have met Solomen, eh? He is a man with a wealth of knowledge. It is good to hear he is well.</span>
</p><p>Now hail Camin.
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Camin says 'Go away! I have no time for you!</span>
</p><p>If this happens, you can continue with the quest. 
</p><p>If you have good faction already, you can talk to Camin:
</p><p><span style="color:red">you say, 'What are you searching for?'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Camin says 'Ah! A smart one, I see! If you really wish to know about such a thing, you will have to help me finance my studies. The knowledge I have acquired and researched did not come cheaply.</span>
</p><p>At this point, hand Camin 1000 platinum and the quest will continue. Some have even reported this as working while being apprehensive to him (confirmed you must do this part of the quest or the next part will result in "I do not do business with your kind."). Doing this will make Camin reply with:
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Camin says, 'Good, good, you show a willingness to learn of this with your offer. What I can tell you is that Solusek Ro had four followers who had shown exceptional aptitude in the arts of wizardry. Solusek Ro himself tutored them. He considered them to be like his own children. I know of one who still exists. He goes by the name of Arantir Karondor. He used to specialize in the storing of magic into physical objects. Arantir has been hiding for many, many years and will most assuredly be going by another name, so keep your eyes open. Anyway, be off, I need to continue my research. Return to me if you ever find Arantir Karondor.'</span>&nbsp;

<p>Now to find Arantir Karondor. I honestly have no idea what Verant was thinking when they did this part of the quest. There are zero clues as to who or where this person is and honestly, it's sort of disturbing to me that every other class' quest is straightforward, but still has a very good degree of difficulty. None the less, there is a female NPC vendor in Halas named 'Dargon' that sells a potion called Ro's Breath. She is located in front of the Shaman guild. Purchase this potion from Dargon for the sum of about 900pp to 1100pp depending on your faction and charisma. (**evil races be warned - you ARE KOS to surrounding NPC's.
</p><p>There is also three other known vendors in the world that sell Ro's Breath:
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Female Barbarian, Marlyn McMerin (loc -3825, +1665), who is found on the dock shops in Fironia Vie.
</li><li>Female Iksar shaman vendor, Klok Scaleroot in West Cabilis.
</li><li>Female coldain dwarf, Hudda, who is found within the bank inside the city of Thurgadin.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<p>You can buy Ro's Breath from any of these vendors but you cannot return it to them. Neither of them will turn into Arantir. However, it is confirmed that you can buy Ro's Breath them, take it to Camin to be stripped of it's charge, and then take it to Dargon. Handing this potion to Dargon in Halas will make her turn into Arantir and the quest will continue.

<p>Now take this potion back to Camin in Erudin and hand it to him. He will reply with the following:
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Camin says 'Very interesting... I've seen this work before. Yes, yes! It's the work of Arantir Karondor! Give this back to the person you got it from. Maybe he will have a clue to Arantir's location.'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:orange">Your faction standing with Truespirit got better.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:orange">You gain experience!!</span>
</p><p>Camin gives you back the potion (it has now been stripped of it's Shield of Lava charge) and you must take it back to Dargon in Halas.
Note: you cannot skip the previous trip to Camin. You absolutely, must hand the potion to Camin. If you try to skip the trip to Erudin, you will get the following message from Dargon: "I didnt request this item, but thank you very much".

<p>Back in Halas, hand the Ro's Breath potion back to Dargon. She will turn into blue robe adorned, Arantir Karondor and reply with:
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Dargon says 'So, I've been discovered! You must know Camin - he is one of the only people who could have recognized my work. I have worked very hard to mask my presence here.'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:red">You say, 'hail Arantir Karondor'</span>

<p>The letter that Arantir hands you is actually a ring called Arantir's Ring. Identifying it reveals: <span style="color:orange">Item Lore: My love has no bounds.</span>Challice is found in the basement of the Felwithe paladin guild. Once you hand Challice the ring, she will reply with:
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Challice says 'Oh yes? Arantir? What a fool he was! the man gave me everything, but for all his intelligence, he could never understand why I was truly with him.

<p>This new ring, when indentified reads: <span style="color:orange">Item Lore: I never could love a man like you.</span>Take this ring back to Dargon/Arantir in Halas and hand it over.
</p><p><span style="color:red">you say, 'Hail Arantir Karondor!'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Arantir Karondor says 'Ah, but it pains my heart to see this. How I could love a women like that is beyond me. And yet, I still do love her. It was on the day I was to ask her to marry me that I lost my powers. When I was about to cast my greatest spell to prove my love to her, my magic failed. She ran out on me that day. But enough of me, do you wish to hear my story?'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:red">you say, 'I wish to hear your story.'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Arantir Karondor says 'I once was one of four true followers of Solusek Ro. So great were the four of us that Solusek Ro himself made us each a special item. We did not know what the others' items were, but we realized that was for our own safety. Each one of us, after receiving the item, began to plot against Solusek Ro. Each of us believed we had enough power to dominate Norrath. Solusek Ro saw this and at the time we needed our powers most, he stripped us of them. Now I know two of the other wizards by name. One was called Sylen Tyrn, the other's name was Demunir Scry. The last wizard was a gnome, but I can't think of his name.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:red">you say, 'What about Sylen Tyrn?'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Arantir Karondor says 'Sylen was a high elf wizard, and like many high elves, he believed himself to be better than others. Because of his birth, he thought he was more noble and more intelligent than anyone else. I heard how met his demise - while flying over a vast area of water, his powers were stripped from him in midflight. He fell and was captured by a rival wizard who specialized in magics of the water. Search for that wizard and you could find a trace of Sylen.</span>

Once you have the powder, return to Kandin and hand only the powder to him. Upon handing Kandin the mistletoe powder, he will return to you the <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14339" class="external text" title="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14339" rel="nofollow">Staff of Gabstik</a>. Once he hands you the staff he asks for his bag back. Hand him 'Kandin's Bag'

<p>If you hail Kandin instead of handing him the skin, the following is what will happen -
</p><p><span style="color:red">You say, 'hail Kandin Firepot'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Kandin Firepot says 'Hello, there! Don't have time to talk. I'm workin', workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the oil!</span>
</p><p><span style="color:red">You say, 'what oil?'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Kandin Firepot says 'Ah the oil! I recently sent a specially crafted golem to explore through a huge portal to another plane. It's instructions were to collect special oil that I suspect existed in the plane. What I think is the golem broke down. This looks like a good task for one like you. Go see what's wrong with the golem. Here is spare gears of mine incase it's broken. Be careful though, if you put it in wrong it could explode or worse!</span>
</p><p>This golem is a non-aggro 'broken golem' that is found in the Plane of Fear (-720, -109). Hand the broken golem the golem sprocket -
</p><p><span style="color:blue">an enraged golem says 'Error! Malfunction! Destroy!</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">an enraged golem says 'Warriors like you always bring out the worst in me.'</span>
You now have an enraged golem on your hands that is aggro. The enraged golem can double hit for 400 each, has approximately 150k HP and is not a caster. Flame based spells and lures are most efficient to use in bringing him down. Once he is dead, loot the <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14349" class="external text" title="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14349" rel="nofollow">green oil</a> from his corpse. Take this green oil back to Kandin in the ButcherBlock Mountains.
</p><p><span style="color:red">You say, 'hail Kandin Firepot'</span>
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Kandin Firepot says 'Hello, there! Don't have time to talk. I'm workin', workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the oil!</span>
Hand over the oil.
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Kandin Firepot says 'Oh wow! You found the oil! Where is the golem? You didn't hurt him did you? I am very fond of him. Anyways, here is your reward a note and staff to give to that guy you were asking me about.</span>
</p><p><span style="color:orange">Your faction standing with Truespirit got better</span>
</p><p>You will now have BOTH the note to take to Dargon/Arantir and the <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14339" class="external text" title="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14339" rel="nofollow">Staff of Gabstik</a>.

<p>Now take this note from Kandin and give it to Dargon in Halas. This will cause Arantir to spawn in the place of Dargon once again. Once Arantir has spawned, hail him and continue.
</p><p><span style="color:red">You say, 'hail Arantir Karondor'</span>

<p>At this point, hand Arantir all three staves, the Blue Crystal Staff, the Gnarled Staff, and the Staff of Gabstik. IMPORTANT: Be sure to have an empty slot open in your MAIN inventory before you hand over the 3 staves. That or have a container that can hold a 'giant' item.
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Arantir Karondor says 'Here, this pack contains all of our items. You will never be able to open it again, so you must deliver the pack, intact, to Solomen. He will then reward you. Now that I have helped you, leave me in peace.'</span>
</p><p>Now you must go back to Solomen in the Temple of Solusek Ro (not Camin!) and hand him this pack. Upon doing so will result in getting the epic item, <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14341" class="external text" title="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=14341" rel="nofollow">Staff of the Four</a>.
</p><p><span style="color:blue">Solomen says 'You actually did it! I never would have thought that anyone could have truly followed this path. This is a tribute to your intelligence and patience. Here, take this staff and know that you have made Solusek Ro and all the wizards of the world proud this day.</span>
