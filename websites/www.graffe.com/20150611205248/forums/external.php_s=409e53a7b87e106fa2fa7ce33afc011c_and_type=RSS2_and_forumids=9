			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So a very-higher-up's machine starts failing.<br />
<br />
Motherboard errors. (CMOS battery is bad, fails to register RAM the same each boot, sometimes fails to register keyboard or NIC, etc etc)<br />
<br />
Fine, it's 3 years old and under constant and heavy use. Pity that it's a four hour drive one way to get on site from here (and we're the closest site with IT personnel) but fine, that's what UPS and/or FedEx are for.<br />
<br />
I limp said person's machine along for the weekend, with an older backup machine so said person can work from home if needed for most things, and image and ship a replacement, after all, why send a tech to West Bumfuck Podunksville if we can just have the thing shipped here and have them stop out in the metro area, right?<br />
<br />
User has some proprietary apps.<br />
<br />
User has not had an on-site IT person for 3 years.<br />
<br />
Okay, fine, I track down the purchase orders for the licensing from LOOOONG before I started with the company and once the new machine arrives, I begin the installation process.<br />
<br />
One of these things includes installing Toad for Oracle.<br />
<br />
Now, this program (especially on a 64 bit machine) is a clusterfuck on the best of days.<br />
<br />
The installation process reads as follows:<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Paraphrased to protect the helpful:<br />
<br />
Install the 64 bit client driver for 11g.<br />
<br />
Install the 32 bit version located at \\server\share\ribbit  These two don't seem to conflict so far.<br />
<br />
The installer checks the length of the %path% variable and it can only be 1023 bytes, so since the 32 bit version expands all variables (%windir% becomes &quot;C:\Windows\System32) you will need to cut portions of your path variable at random until it's under the limit, ensuring that the Oracle home location can be fully included. It's kind of a crap shoot.<br />
<br />
Once that's all done, fire up Toad and ensure it points to the correct Oracle Home (32 bit) client.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>WHICH YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL SEPARATELY because<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			The default included with the install is pretty old.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>add several more steps.<br />
<br />
Now, once I've gotten through that, I discover that I do not have ANY CONN STRINGS.<br />
<br />
So, okay, I get directed to one of the database admins on the oracle team.<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
Old machine is dead, so I can't exactly go digging around for .ora files.<br />
<br />
So the person whose machine is dead starts e-mailing people.<br />
<br />
Previously mentioned database admin FINALLY (after a day and change from first contact) responds with the following:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			The latest tnsnames file should be in TFS
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>MOTHERFUCKER, IF I HAD ACCESS TO TO OUR TEAM FOUNDATION SERVER INSTANCE, DON'T YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE FUCKING LOOKED THERE?!?!?!<br />
<br />
THANK YOU VERY FUCKING MUCH, DEEPAK CHANDRAKUNT (not the real name) FOR ALL OF THAT I COULD HAVE ASKED SANTA CLAUS TO TAKE OFF FROM HIS GROTTO IN JALANDHAR AND SHOUT:<br />
<br />
ON DAVINDER!!!<br />
<br />
ON BALJEET SINGH!!!!<br />
<br />
AND MAYBE I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN A FUCKING ORA FILE DROPPED DOWN THE CHIMNEY OF THE BUILDING FROM A PRINTOUT SPAT FROM AN ANCIENT HP LASERJET 5 AND IF I WAS LUCKY, IT MIGHT NOT HAVE CLOGGED UP THE HVAC AND OVERHEATED THE SERVER ROOM.<br />
<br />
Oooorrrr you could have just attached it to an e-mail since you know where it is.<br />
<br />
THANKS FOR COMING OUT.<br />
<br />
SO HAPPY YOU'RE IN YOUR OWN LITTLE FUCKING WORLD OVER THERE ON THE WEST COAST.</div>

<br />
We have owned it for 10 years now.<br />
<br />
I had thought we were done dealing with this guy's utter BULLSHIT DIY.<br />
<br />
This fucker duct taped over some intake vents for the central air.<br />
<br />
Instead of Romack staples, he used bent nails.<br />
<br />
Use a cable fish to get the cat5 and coax to the basement, then install outlets? <br />
<br />
Nope, drill a hole through the carpet and then floor.<br />
<br />
This fuckmunch was easily the most over-zealous chimeric monster of home repair who regularly said &quot;fuck it&quot; on some projects.<br />
<br />
I say chimeric because the &quot;fuck it, let's half-ass this&quot; attitude only seemed to run in ONE of the brains his chimera of a self must have had.<br />
<br />
One fancied itself as an &quot;artiste&quot;.<br />
<br />
We moved in to one 30 foot wall that wrapped into a split foyer.<br />
<br />
These pictures are from the paint job he did there.<br />

<br />
<br />
Now, these aren't my particular style, no big deal...<br />
<br />
...except that in order to paint over it, we had to remove 1/2mm x 1/2mm little squares of phosphorescent glitter over the ENTIRE THING. (no flash, because you couldn't SEE THE PICTURE if the flash was on)<br />
<br />
They weren't just stuck to the paint, they were GLUED DOWN.<br />
<br />
There were TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM scattered over the entire thing.<br />
<br />
I can only surmise that he used some kind of clear glue lacquer and chucked them at the wall.<br />
<br />
It took about 30 hours of work between two of us to get them all scraped off. Over light beige shag carpet.<br />
<br />
See the stuff on the left.<br />
<br />

<br />
We had enough of the stuff to make almost two &quot;Spencer's Games&quot; sized disco balls that were comprised entirely of the stuff by the time it was all scraped off. I'm talking not fucking hollow disco balls. I'm talking about ones made of SOLID FUCKING GLITTER.<br />
<br />
We were finding that stuff EVERYWHERE for a good 6 or 7 years. Every once in a while, I still see it.<br />
<br />
Thankfully it's no longer so FUCKING UBIQUITOUS that it ends up in my stool.<br />
<br />
This glitter point leads me to the final of the three chimera brains.<br />
<br />
The other one RADICALLY, TRULY, AND UTTERLY OVERDID THINGS.<br />
<br />
<br />
In this picture you can see some nasty fake plastic latticework.<br />

<br />
Now, this wasn't just screwed into the wall.<br />
<br />
No, no, that would be the way a NORMAL person would do things. Use some appropriately painted screw-heads and you're good, right?<br />
<br />
Since I couldn't throw Hercules' Invisible suit over the nasty faux-wood white plastic latticework, we took up the task of removing it. <br />
<br />
Except...<br />
<br />
Before he made the final twist of each screw, he squirted some epoxy between the back of the screw head and the latticework screw hole.<br />
<br />
Pretty diabolical, right?<br />
<br />
IT GETS WORSE.<br />
<br />
HE THEN SPACKLED OVER THE SCREW HEADS.<br />
<br />
Now, keep in mind, this was probably done right around 1985.<br />
<br />
I forget exactly what we used, but it was similar to dental tools for the spackle, then we had to crack the plastic that the screw was epoxied to.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, once a few screws at key points were removed, we were able to gleefully destroy the latticework and just remove the plastic that was adhered to the remaining screws.<br />
<br />
Annoying as fuck, but we were able to paint that wall with almost no damage to the drywall.<br />
<br />
<br />
During the same painting project (since it was decided that the &quot;dining room&quot; wall the latticework was on should wrap around to the deck door wall, and then around to where the mural was, and all the way around and down the landing, it became obvious that, because it was a split foyer, we would need to remove the bannister railing.<br />
<br />
It was your typical second-hand cheap round curtain rod with four faux-brass brackets.<br />
<br />
Think this with some varnish on it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Now, this was screwed in to the wall. Three screws per bracket, straight into the wall.<br />
<br />
Piece of cake, right?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this fucker decided that BEFORE he screwed it in all the way, he should GLUE THE BRACKETS TO THE DRYWALL.<br />
<br />
Industrial strength glue was of some kind was applied.<br />
<br />
Glue so strong that any HOPE of removing it to repaint was null and void...without tearing off the sections of drywall it was adhered to.<br />
<br />
This was glued in so hard that 250lb me and my 120lb wife working together with all of our bodyweight combined couldn't get it to budge because it was anchored so evenly.<br />
<br />
We ended up chiseling it out as best we could and patching the drywall, then screwing it in post-painting in different spots.<br />
<br />
But I thought that was the end of it, I really did. it was years ago.<br />
<br />
Surely he couldn't have fucked up anything else so severely. I mean, he fucked up the copper piping for the water heater, but we redid that when we replaced it, and thankfully he didn't touch the gas piping, only the water.<br />
<br />
Insert years of happiness with only the occasional annoying failure, a standard thing with home ownership.<br />
<br />
Then...(dun..dun..DUN!!!)<br />
<br />
Then the other week our kitchen light (picture here, from before we purchased the house) went out. Not a huge deal, we'll wait for a memorial day sale and get a new one.<br />
<br />

<br />
We once waited three weeks without light in the kitchen because the fixture takes an odd-sized bulb anyway and they had to be ordered, so fine. The light under the hood of the stove works for cooking.<br />
<br />
I'm not particularly sad, I didn't really like that thing anyway, the plastic cover was a pain in the ass to get off because it would only drop a few centimeters, and then you had to somehow reach in and pinch metal clips to release in four spots.<br />
<br />
We had, however, always thought it was impressive how well he'd painted RIGHT up to the surface of the thing. Maybe he did this one thing right?<br />
<br />
Since a fixture replacement involves electrical wiring, we bought a new one and had my father-in-law come over. He put in our ceiling fan as a replacement for whatever that supremely ugly faux-tiffanny light over the dining room table was, and said he didn't quite trust the wiring in the ceiling at that time. <br />
<br />
(Hint, hint, that lamp is nail-polished glass, not actual colored glass)<br />
<br />
So he comes over, starts looking at it with some nice halogen lighting and says &quot;wow, I'm a perfectionist, but he really did paint this all the way up to the...&quot;<br />
<br />
He pries testingly.<br />
<br />
He shines a light on the seam between the fixture and the popcorn ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least he used the really, really good stuff, I'm going to need more tools&quot;<br />
<br />
HE USED SILICONE CAULK TO CEMENT THE LIGHT FIXTURE TO THE CEILING ON TOP OF THE SCREWS.<br />
<br />
It's firm enough that we think he caulked the ENTIRE FOOTPRINT.<br />
<br />
So now we have an unused light fixture to return, because there is NO WAY to get this fucking broken one off without damaging the ceiling, so replacing it with the same size is going to be impossible without visible ceiling damage.<br />
<br />
We'll be buying a new one with a larger footprint.<br />
<br />
I don't even HAVE enough curse words for how long this self-fellating DIYer has haunted our home ownership experience.<br />
<br />
I can only take joy in the fact that I *hope* we'll have it all cleaned up by the time we sell the place in a few years...with almost all new fixtures and appliances...out of need.<br />
<br />
FUCK YOU, BILL.</div>
