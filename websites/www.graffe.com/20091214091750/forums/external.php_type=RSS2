Also, from something more recent, I'd like to point out that your current or past usernames are not &quot;private information.&quot;  Staff may choose to respect your anonymity or not at their own discretion.  There isn't a &quot;rule&quot; on that or anything, so if members want one, they'll have to formulate one for inclusion in the future.  I think creating a rule on it would be fraught with problems, and open the door to abuse, so if I were to create a rule, it would just be &quot;you're not allowed more than 1 account per person&quot;</div>

If I end up making a buck or two I can pay for an upgraded store that gives more options. <br />
<br />
I haven't yet purchased a shirt from them, but a buddy has his own shop and says the quality is good.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Ok, I'm sure some of you in here like flight simulators. With a father who was in the Air Force, growing up near SAC (former name of STRATCOM) headquarters, I developed quite an interest in everything aerospace. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a military pilot. Glad I didn't go that route, I'd have been put in the position of being ordered to kill people i didn't necessarily believe needed killed.... <br />
<br />
Nonetheless, I've played a few simulators over the years, from the arcade like to the most dedicated to realism of physics; I generally have a good time with them.<br />
<br />
One of my all time favorites, to this day, despite the 1990's graphics, is <a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/ysflight/frmindexe.html" target="_blank">ysflight</a>, and in particular, a modded, much more physics faithful version, ysflightrealism (Harder to come by, not many seeders for it). The number of planes available in a freeware game is unsurpassed as far as I am aware, the physics are pretty good (assuming calm winds at all times and an aircraft that remains indestructible under infinite stress as long as it doesn't hit the ground or get shot down lol), and it is extensively modable. Want a Piper Archer armed with a cannon, 40 short and medium range AAM's, 80 500lbs bombs, 20 long range air-to-surface missiles, and enough thrust to get it all airborne and cruising happily at mach 5.5? It can be yours. Want a B-52 that can out maneuver a Su-27? Done. An A-10 that can achieve mach 50? (yes, that's 50, not 5) Go for it. A hang glider that can easily out dogfight 3 F-18s? Hell yeah...  Its really a blast.</div>

				CHARLESTON, WV - A freelance photographer is outraged after being arrested for taking pictures.<br />
<br />
The dispute revolves around what exactly happened recently at a Charleston, West Virginia mall.<br />
<br />
Scott Rensberger says when he took some photos of a child on Santa's lap, a man asked him if he could delete the photos.<br />
<br />
He says he complied, but then moments later, Rensberger says police officers approached asking why he was taking photos of kids.<br />
<br />
The argument got heated when police say Rensberger started taking photos of the officers, who then arrested him.<br />
<br />
Rensberger is now facing battery, resisting arrest and obstructing justice.<br />
<br />
&quot;American's gone nuts. We can't take pictures anymore,&quot; said Rensberger.<br />
<br />
He continued, &quot;Two gentlemen walked into the store and they asked me if I took a picture of Santa and I said yes I did. And they said, my daughter, my child was on his lap, could you delete that picture? And I said, oh, sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;These officers approached me, one in particular, and asked me, he said, why are you taking pictures of kids? And I was shocked by that,&quot; Rensberger said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I snapped off a picture (of the officers questioning him) and at the same time he grabbed my camera, and I reached up with my left hand to catch the camera from hitting the floor and he said don't you touch me,&quot; he continued.<br />
<br />
Rensberger stated, &quot;He (the officer) said, if your shoulder dislocates, we'll call a paramedic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never in a million years slap a police officer in any way.&quot; There are people with cell phones everywhere, are we gonna arrest everyone for taking a picture that a child might be, like, this big in the shot?&quot; he continued.<br />
<br />
Rensberger says he plans to argue his case in court.<br />
<br />
Mall officials meanwhile did not have a comment on their photo policy.

Many photographers have responded with their own stories of being harassed for taking photos.</div>

<br />
I have not paid for a newspaper in almost 7 years.  I still read 4 or 5 every day but I never pay for them.  I read local news, court news, town news, state politics, obits and skim NYT and WSJ for anything interesting to me.<br />
<br />
I am not sure I would pay for any but maybe town news and court news if the web disappeared.  <br />
<br />
I think I WOULD pay for a really good search engine that fed me the stories I like and need though.  But there is google basically doing that on demand with the content of others.  I saw that some newspapers are thinking of delisting from google for that very reason.<br />
<br />
Is there anything a newspaper could do to get your money or is it basically over?</div>

<br />
Quick question for the guru's here. I'm getting a 500G drive for Christmas, and I've done some debating getting Windows 7 (not to mention, I'm going to partition too, and drop a Ubuntu distro on it as well).<br />
However, for Windows 7, I'm trying to figure if I want the 32 bit or 64.<br />
System specs are as follows:<br />
Windows XP Pro, Version 2002, Service Pack 3<br />
Computer: Intel(R) Celeron (R) CPU E1400 @ 2.00 Ghz 2.01 Ghz, 3.00 GB RAM<br />
<br />
I tried to locate how to see if it was compliant, but it appears most information is for Vista.<br />
Is there a site, or maybe app/scan that can tell me?<br />
<br />
I know it's not the fastest PC, but I built this unit on a quick budget when I lost my job (old PC fried on me).<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Suggestions?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>With the appearance of the looking for dungeon tool, I have actually done some instances in wotlk. Since my son was born, I haven't really had enough time chunks to look for a group and then run through an instance, so since wotlk came out, I had (before now) only done a couple instances.<br />
<br />
I've queued up for normal dungeons a few times (got the 3 new ones, occulus, stratholme, and the last 2 of the new ones), and found that we're usually ridiculously overgeared for the normals, except for the new ones. I haven't done ToC yet, but I'm wondering if it would be safe to queue as a dps war (arms) for heroic now.<br />
<br />
Also, if I queue heroic, does the new LFD system check my gear and only queue for the heroics that I would be geared for? I know it prevents crappy geared people from queueing heroic, but I don't know if it checks for the individual dungeons.<br />
<br />
Here's my armory: <a href="http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Uther&amp;n=Telrath" target="_blank">http://www.wowarmory.com/character-s...ther&amp;n=Telrath</a><br />
<br />
edit: that's actually my pvp set, but it's not much different from my main dps set. Just add an ap+chance for expertise trinket, and <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;"
