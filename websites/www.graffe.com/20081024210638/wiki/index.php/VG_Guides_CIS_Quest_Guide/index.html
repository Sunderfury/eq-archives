<p><br />
Cloak quest: Talk to Scholar Donovan at Donovan's Roost (he doesn't have a quest-shield above his head, just engage in conversation).<br clear="all" />
</p><p>Step 1: Talk to the ranger. He roams around the area inside the mines. If you go S/SE from the area entrance, you'll find a place with a small ramp up to some Infineum guards - he tends to wander just on the downside of that ramp.<br clear="all" />
</p><p>Step 2: Talk to the slave at the entrance - follow quest location marker<br clear="all" />
</p><p>Step 3: Slave needs a key to unshackle his trapped belt. Key is held by slavemaster... move S/SW until you find an area with tents. Slavemaster is in the largest tent. Set up camp behind the tent and clear all the 4 dots. When Slavemaster is pulled, he will trigger adds. Kill Slavemaster, loot key.<br clear="all" />
</p><p>Step 4: Talk to slave again, who tells you to get a pick axe and find ore. Thralls/slaves in the mine area drop pickaxes (not the ones closer to the Vihaad Villagers). Get a pick, and mine 5 ores in the area.<br clear="all" />
</p><p>Step 5: Return to Scholar Donovan.<br clear="all" />
<br clear="all" />
</p><p><br />
Next, he will give you the ring quest (need level 21 to get quest).
From there you need to head south east into the mines until you come across 2 buildings side by side, inside they look like librarys (hence quest tip about library)
</p><p>The one you need is on the left, kill to there or invis past and clicky the book on the table in the back, a spirit will spawn and everyone in the group has to hail the spirt to get the next quest.
</p><p>Vengence sends you just around the corner to the north east to another building, clear all the mobs inside and hail the spirit that pops, he tells you to kill another mob.
</p><p>This mob is non agro (like captin) and is surrounded by 3 atriums, he will bug if you try to kite him so make sure you fight him where he stands and all group mates are right next to him.
</p><p>Hail him to initiate the script, and 4-5 3 dot mobs spawn and begin attacking you along with the named who is 26 4 dot. burn named down mez adds, or just burn named down, loot the corpse (everyone needs to) and evac. Right click on the book you get in your inventory to complete the quest, return to donovan.
</p><p><br />
He now sends you out to collect some samples from the various mobs in the mines, the key is to look for mobs with the name of the part you need (they are titled appropriately) so once you find a match kill it and loot it for an update.
</p><p>After that quest you are sent to a robot in the southeast portion of the mines he is easiest to find, if you look on your map there is a sort of scar that runs across the mines from west to east, the robot is near the very tip of this scar.
</p><p>Head over to him to turn in the quest and pick an earring
</p><p>you must drink the immunity potion given by the quest to get the next series of quests from him.
</p><p>hail him again and get 2 quests to kill guys for their robes and mobs for their gems they are found in the general vacinity he is located so you dont have to go far.
</p><p>turn those in and he offers the next part for the starter on making the weapons. some people in my group were lvl 22 and could still get this part of the quest.
</p><p>he gives you a robe that you have to wear to sneak into the building you need (the mobs will be yellow, and its the forge if you know where that is- if not look for a building surrounded by yellow mobs with the robe on)
</p><p>head in and talk to the dude to get the making the weapons part, buy the freebie book from him and then turn to the guy on his left to find the ingredients you need to make your weapon.
</p><p>then go back and buy them, it costs 62 silver per, and it takes 2 items to make each weapon, so in total you need 1 g 24s to complete this part of the quest, then take the bought goods to have him make you your infinium weapon.
</p><p>This results in a yellow lvl 27 item with kinda puny stats because you have to power it up, he sends you back to the robot, who will then offer the quest to power up the weapons
</p><p>this part you must be lvl 25 to get. and is where we left off last night.
</p><p>The next part is powering up the weapons, forgot quest name
</p><p>It sends you to the altar of ages, wich is on a plataue with non agro mobs, pretty easy to find as you pass it on the way to the robot from donovan's roost, right before you chunk.
</p><p>You hail the NPC and all the non agro mobs despawn (I /bugged this because these mobs were great xp and since the all de-pop you cant xp on them as groups are fighting this NPC constantly /rant off)
</p><p>He spawns 3 4 dot mobs at the base of each of the steps and they charge up at you.
</p><p>I found it best to fight him at the bottom of the alter, there are 3 atriums and there is a very large gap between 2 of them, fight him down on the ground in the middle of these two atriums, large open space.
</p><p>Kill off the adds first, then start on the named, he must phase shift 2 x (at around 50% hp) before you can kill him and get update.
</p><p>when he phase shifts a ghost spawns up at the altar, and if you are at the bottom of the altar wont agro you, wink, wink. Then about 5 seconds later the named NPC will come charging back at you.
</p><p>after you do this 2x, he is killable (i've CV killed him on the 1st phase shift and didn't get people updates and had to do it again) once he dies all get updates, head back to robot and get book right clicky book to make the mercurial infineum weapons.
</p><p>The next part is called "the summoning"
</p><p>you have to head south past the forge till you come to a large infineum structure in a small crator. You can run around to the south to shorten the time it takes to get inside the area where the updates are, the mobs inside are non agro, and there is a large 6 dot mob.
</p><p>right click the altar the priest is at to initiate the event, and watch the 6 dotter eat everyone alive.
</p><p>then when hes full you hail the spirit that pops and he ends up attacking you, dont remember the lvl of the mob but I believe it was lvl 30-32 5 dotter, pretty straight forward fight no tricks with adds poping or anything.
</p><p>finish that quest off and return to the robot, he sends you to the mining camp to talk to the smith.
</p><p>to advance this part you need to have a piece of scavenged infineum armor on you, and buy the 62s ale, once you have the ale you can re-hail him and he gives you a chat box option to turn your armor into Re-wrought infineum armor.
</p><p>It seemed if I had more than once piece it would pick the one that came first in my bags, so if you dont want the piece crafted that pops up trade it to another party member, and re-hail him till you get the one you want.
</p><p>once its re-forged hail him once again to turn it into the armor, and update the quest, from this point forward you can make and wear all the infineum armor pieces for 62s ale + the armor mold's that drop in the mines and in the sanctuary + the rare gems, you need 1 yellow gem for all slots except chest/legs, and a orange inferno gem for chest/legs.
</p><p>be warned that if you have a red gem on you it will consume this FIRST for ALL slots, so make sure you either put it in the bank, or have a chest/leg's ready to be made.
</p><p>caster legs are nice mine are 14 int 14 wis 24 SDF +1 energy regen and still use them. Robe is well bleh, not worth it 31 int 49 SDF and 1% spell dmg (rare crafted robe is better)
</p><p>the next part is the ageless one
</p><p>to get this quest you must have a key to the temple of kronus
</p><p>You have to either fight up to the top (or use lev and sneak up the back) once at the top of the hill there will be a bridge, you must run across with a non agro npc, hail him for the sub quest, that sends you to kill the 4 guardians.
</p><p>best way to do it is to start from the top down, so you dont have to use the grav elevator.
</p><p>each named is a 6 dot, that gets a tad harder, but easily one groupable.
</p><p>after the 4 die, head back to the npc and turn in the quest, you then get the quest to kill kronus who is a lvl 32 6 dot and he has a ton of hp.
</p><p>walk up to kronos and a window pops up, click the window, and or click the scroll in your inventory to make him agro
</p><p>take it slow he has a lot of hp, fight times range from 3-10 minutes depending on dps (bring a sorc *wink*) try to avoid pulling agro as one shottedness insues, also watch CV spam he has self buffs that reduce his arcane damage, so use disenchant on those times instead of casting aonther cv, I had it up to 21k by the end of the fight, and killed myself with a 2700 crit.
</p><p>after killing him head back to the NPC at the top across the bridge to get your reward, and then to update the ageless one and get weapon head back to the mining camp to the NPC that you turn in the armor to, and it auto updates the ageless one quest when you get near him, hail him to complete and get the yanvil
</p><p>I actually am wearing the staff, since it has +93 to SDF, i lost about 20 from my 2 items, but bought some boots with no wis and SDF and im back to cap, staff clicky does anywhere from 350-450 and crits for 900, it comes in handy a lot.
</p><p>enjoy
