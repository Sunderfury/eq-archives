			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>2015 is almost over, but before we look forward to what 2016 will bring us, let's look back and appreciate what we enjoyed the most in 2015.<br />
<br />
It can be anything you played, whether it came out this year or not, though you may still want to make the distinction. I played a heck load of games this year, and actually spent most of my time trying to catch up on what I missed rather than playing new games, so I'm going to cheat and do both.<br />
<br />
My favorite games released in 2015 were:<br />
<br />
1) Ori and the Blind Forest - I almost forgot about this one, as it was earlier in the year. It was very nearly my perfect game. Great pacing with a good amount of content.<br />
2) Batman: Arkham Knight - I got lucky and it actually ran on my PC (after they &quot;fixed&quot; it). Much like Ori, it was exactly what I needed it to be, with only the Riddler trophies marring the package.<br />
<br />
My favorite games played in 2015, but released previously:<br />
<br />
1) The Witcher 1/2 - I had these in the backlog and never made time for them before now. Great games. It's hard to say if I liked them more than the two above or not.<br />
2) Danganronpa 1/2 - Very niche. Scratched an itch I didn't know needed scratching. Once I got past the weird character designs I found it to be engrossing.<br />
<br />
<br />
There were a number of things I missed or didn't have time for. Witcher 3 being the forefront of the list. Judging by how much I liked the previous two, it probably would have gotten a mention as well. I've also yet to get a Wii U, despite it having an even better year than last year.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>We are discussing get a game console for Christmas. This plus a game or two would be *the* present under the tree, nothing else but stocking stuffers, and we want to get it right.<br />
<br />
The last console we had, which was lost in the epic flooding of 2013, was a Wii for playing goofy games with the extended family. Years before that we had a PS2 which mainly gathered dust. We aren't really console people.<br />
<br />
However our daughter, H, is 6 and is showing a lot of interest in computer games, especially SWOTOR. There are obvious downsides to letting a 6 year old loose in that kind of gaming environment, not to mention the problem of being asked &quot;Mommy read this to me&quot; every 30 seconds. I've seen the Disney Infinity Star Wars game, and frankly I can't think of anything that would make H happier than being able to run around as Ahsoka and Leia -- and at some point I am assuming, Rei. I'm guessing some of the other Disney characters would be hits with her too. But one game does not a console purchase justify, and any way it seems to be available for both X-Box and Playstation (though on Amazon it looks like the Star Wars saga pack is for PS4 only??)<br />
<br />
So, which console and which games would you buy if the primary audience is a 6 year old who turns every toy she has into a vehicle for elaborate story telling, who loves Star Wars, Dungeon (the board game), Nerf Guns, fairies and elves of all sorts, and the RPG component of SWOTOR (she really loves the dialogue choices). Additional complication -- H regards being alone as a fate worse than death, so it would be good if there are games we can play with her without wanting to kill ourselves. Or her.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This was announced at the 2015 Game Awards, but I thought I would make a thread for it for those who like free games but don't care about the other stuff in that thread.<br />
<br />
Shadow Complex is a 2D action platformer in the Metroidvania* style that was released on the 360 about six years ago, and was arguably one of the forerunners of digital content for the platform. It was very popular and I had always wished it would get a PC version. Now not only is it getting &quot;remastered&quot; for modern consoles, but it's got a PC version that as the title says is free through the month of December. The only caveat is that you need to download it through Epic's own game service/launcher.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.epicgames.com/shadowcomplex/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.epicgames.com/shadowcomplex/</a><br />
<br />
*Metroidvania refers to a style of gameplay that comes from mashing up Metroid and Castlevania styles. Instead of levels you have one expansive complex that gets mapped as you explore. Eventually you find upgrades that let you access previously inaccessible areas.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to open a can of worms, but I will put it one disclaimer for those of you it matters to. Shadow Complex is based on the book Empire by Orson Scott Card.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Here I go again, forgetting to make a thread about this until the last minute. It's time for the second year of Video Game Awards after the split with Spike TV. Last year's was pretty disorganized, but I appreciated what they were trying to do and there were definitely parts that I liked, and it was a big improvement over the year prior to that. Here's hoping it improves again this year.<br />
<br />
Though, if I'm honest, one of the main reasons why I ever care about these shows at all is that for awhile they were used as an extra event to announce games, but that was becoming less true even when Spike TV ran the show, and was almost nonexistent during last year's reboot. Where before, the idea of showing off something in December was novel, the trend has spread and this show is no longer the only avenue to do such a thing with. To some, focusing on the awards and the culture itself is better and makes more sense anyway; I'll reserve further judgement. <br />
<br />
I've been distracted by Fallout 4 and haven't been following this very closely, but apparently Keighley is promising 10 Awards presented on stage, and 10 &quot;World Premiers&quot;, not new announcements necessarily, but rather new looks at upcoming games.<br />
<br />
Some of the things I've seen suggested will be shown: <br />
Tomb Raider<br />
Far Cry Primal<br />
Quantum Break<br />
Oculus Rift<br />
Walking Dead <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to watch it: <a href="http://thegameawards.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://thegameawards.com/</a> Last year's was extremely long though, so I wouldn't blame you for waiting for the highlights.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a bonus, I can't remember if anyone ever made a thread for it when it got announced (the announcement timing was really weird), but here is the trailer for Fall Cry Primal:<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Last year I lumped this in with the Game Awards thread for simplicity, this year I gave them each their own thread to allow for more editorializing (rambling) without having to worry about thread bloat. I'm not sure the level of discussion will justify two threads, but we will try it and see anyway. I'll still post summaries and trailers I find interesting from each of the events.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this will be the second year for the Playstation Experience. The various game companies have realized that it is beneficial to have big events showing off upcoming releases spread out across the year, instead of just being something you see at E3. Last year's show was actually kind of dull in the grand scheme of things, though I still look forward to seeing what they do this year. <br />
<br />
Having said that, I've been so preoccupied with Fallout 4 that I haven't been following any news lately and have no idea what they possibly could show. It seems a lot of what people are suggesting are the usual contenders that have yet to be shown yet but get suggested every year, either from wish fulfillment or because those studios have got to be making something. Sony Bend's next game, Santa Monica's next game (God of War), Crash Bandicoot, etc.<br />
<br />
They didn't really have many big surprises last year, so I am skeptical they would do it this year. I would expect a focus on anything likely to come out before the next E3. Uncharted 4 and Street Fighter 5 are the only games off the top of my head that meet that criteria. Sony has been working on getting PS2 emulation working on PS4 hardware. Might finally announce that. VR was big at E3 and is supposed to launch in 2016 so maybe they will have a launch date and price?<br />
<br />
Square will definitely be on stage, though whether or not they bring anything of value is a mystery. When they finally announced a FF7 remake earlier in the year they promised to tell us more in December. I don't trust them though, so it's anyone's guess what we will actually get. They've got a lot in development though, so surely they will show something, right?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The year is almost over. December is usually a pretty sparse month for new releases, as most of the publishers push to have their big titles ready in time for the rush of holiday shopping. We've got a couple standouts this year however. <br />
<br />
<br />
Setting aside my own bias, I think the biggest game this month is probably <b>Just Cause 3</b>. The previous game was a bit of a cult classic. These games are about filling open worlds with explosions, and they seem to be upping the ante and refining some of the formula. This is probably <i>the</i> action game to play this year, at least for those who just want dumb fun. Those wanting more direction or an interesting narrative may be disappointed, as that has never been the strength of the series.<br />
<br />
<b>Rainbow Six: Siege</b> is also due this month. This game has high aspirations and could be something great, but I haven't been following it closely enough to know if it will achieve this. It's basically an evolution of competitive shooter design like you would find in Counterstrike or something. Environments are destructible in ways they usually aren't in these games. I'm always a little nervous about games that come out in December (are they being rushed?) but this one definitely suffered a few delays. Will it be better for it? Or will it fail to distinguish itself?<br />
<br />
My personal pick of the month is <b>Xenoblade Chronicles X</b> for the Wii U. I do not know if it can possibly live up to expectations, but what little I've seen of it already is pretty intriguing. This might be the biggest jrpg of the year, and it's on a system not many fans of the genre are likely to own. For some, the previous game justified the Wii, and it will be interesting to see if the same is true now. Some of the design decisions seem questionable to me, but I want to see more. No other series does scale in quite the same way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aside from those three games, we've got a few more jrpg ports on PC, including <b>Dragon Quest Heroes</b> and <b>Lightning Returns</b>. Oh right, and supposedly <b>Devil's Third</b> for the Wii U is going to come out. Remember Devil's Third? The ultra violent action game from Itagaki, the creator of Dead or Alive? No? Might be a reason for that. Buzz for this one seems to be negative. It's anti-buzz. It hasn't shown well I guess and for awhile it wasn't clear if it still existed. Worth keeping an eye on if you have a Wii U though.<br />
<br />
<br />
