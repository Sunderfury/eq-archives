				With the release of Wrath of the Lich King approaching, we wanted to provide you with some important information. In preparation for the expansion, we will be issuing a new content patch in the coming weeks. Much like the patch made available shortly before The Burning Crusade's release, this content patch is designed to bridge current game content with that of the expansion and will contain some exciting changes and additions.<br />
<br />
We have outlined some of the larger features scheduled to release with the patch below:<br />
<br />
New class spells and talents<br />
Stormwind Harbor<br />
Barbershops in capital cities<br />
Zeppelin towers outside of Orgrimmar and Tirisfal Glades<br />
Two brand-new Arenas featuring challenging new layouts, terrain hazards, and moving obstacles<br />
Guild calendar<br />
Hunter pet skill revamp<br />
New profession: Inscription<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, this is not a comprehensive list, just some of the major highlights. We’ll post the full patch notes as soon as they’re available. Regarding Inscription, please note that all Burning Crusade players will be able to select Inscription as one of their two professions and level up to a skill level of 375 with it. Upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King, players who purchase and install the expansion will be able to continue leveling in Inscription and the other professions beyond 375.

	<table cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">

			<hr />
			
				    &quot;The rigorous studies clearly show red-light cameras don't work,&quot; said lead author Barbara Langland-Orban, professor and chair of health policy and management at the USF College of Public Health. &quot;Instead, they increase crashes and injuries as drivers attempt to abruptly stop at camera intersections.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Comprehensive studies from North Carolina, Virginia, and Ontario have all reported cameras are associated with increases in crashes. The study by the Virginia Transportation Research Council also found that cameras were linked to increased crash costs. The only studies that conclude cameras reduced crashes or injuries contained &quot;major research design flaws,&quot; such as incomplete data or inadequate analyses, and were always conducted by researchers with links to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The IIHS, funded by automobile insurance companies, is the leading advocate for red-light cameras since insurance companies can profit from red-light cameras by way of higher premiums due to increased crashes and citations.<br />
<br />
And, of course, the agenda of the government is to increase revenue due to fines:<br />
<br />
    A 2001 paper by the Office of the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives reported that red-light cameras are &quot;a hidden tax levied on motorists.&quot; The report came to the same conclusions that all of the other valid studies have, that red-light cameras are associated with increased crashes and that the timings at yellow lights are often set too short to increase tickets for red-light running. That's right, the state actually tampers with the yellow light settings to make them shorter, and more likely to turn red as you're driving through them.<br />
<br />
    In fact, six U.S. cities have been found guilty of shortening the yellow light cycles below what is allowed by law on intersections equipped with cameras meant to catch red-light runners. Those local governments have completely ignored the safety benefit of increasing the yellow light time and decided to install red-light cameras, shorten the yellow light duration, and collect the profits instead.<br />
<br />
    The cities in question include Union City, CA, Dallas and Lubbock, TX, Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, and Springfield, MO, according to Motorists.org, which collected information from reports from around the country.

Then I tried to stream it from AdultSwim.com and, they just have some weird collection of clips instead of full episodes.....So, I check Netflix, and the DVD's aren't even scheduled for release yet.<br />

I wanted either system to play with him and other friends.  <br />
<br />
So I'm asking you guys, which system is better - in terms of game titles available.  I prefer RPG games like Final Fantasy.  I would like to play online with friends perhaps, and maybe random strangers but I guess that type of play for either system is limited to FPS type games?<br />
<br />
I don't want this thread to get into a pissing match.  I'd just love to hear some good info about each system from people that own them.  I'd REALLY love to hear from someone that owns both.<br />

Thanks in advance!<br />

 NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Nine-year-old Jericho Scott is a good baseball player -- too good, it turns out.<br />
<br />
The right-hander has a fastball that tops out at about 40 mph. He throws so hard that the Youth Baseball League of New Haven told his coach that the boy could not pitch any more. When Jericho took the mound anyway last week, the opposing team forfeited the game, packed its gear and left, his coach said.<br />
<br />
Officials for the three-year-old league, which has eight teams and about 100 players, said they will disband Jericho's team, redistributing its players among other squads, and offered to refund $50 sign-up fees to anyone who asks for it. They say Jericho's coach, Wilfred Vidro, has resigned.<br />
<br />
But Vidro says he didn't quit and the team refuses to disband. Players and parents held a protest at the league's field on Saturday urging the league to let Jericho pitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's never hurt any one,&quot; Vidro said. &quot;He's on target all the time. How can you punish a kid for being too good?&quot;<br />
<br />
The controversy bothers Jericho, who says he misses pitching.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel sad,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel like it's all my fault nobody could play.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jericho's coach and parents say the boy is being unfairly targeted because he turned down an invitation to join the defending league champion, which is sponsored by an employer of one of the league's administrators.<br />
<br />
Jericho instead joined a team sponsored by Will Power Fitness. The team was 8-0 and on its way to the playoffs when Jericho was banned from pitching.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's discouraging when you're telling a 9-year-old you're too good at something,&quot; said his mother, Nicole Scott. &quot;The whole objective in life is to find something you're good at and stick with it. I'd rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner.&quot;<br />
<br />
League attorney Peter Noble says the only factor in banning Jericho from the mound is his pitches are just too fast.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is a very skilled player, a very hard thrower,&quot; Noble said. &quot;There are a lot of beginners. This is not a high-powered league. This is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noble acknowledged that Jericho had not beaned any batters in the co-ed league of 8- to 10-year-olds, but say parents expressed safety concerns.<br />
<br />
&quot;Facing that kind of speed&quot; is frighteneing for beginning players, Noble said.<br />
<br />
League officials say they first told Vidro that the boy could not pitch after a game on Aug. 13. Jericho played second base the next game on Aug. 16. But when he took the mound Wednesday, the other team walked off and a forfeit was called.<br />
<br />
League officials say Jericho's mother became irate, threatening them and vowing to get the league shut down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior Jericho's mother exhibited Wednesday night,&quot; Noble said.<br />
<br />
Scott denies threatening any one, but said she did call the police.<br />
<br />
League officials suggested that Jericho play other positions, or pitch against older players or in a different league.<br />
<br />
Local attorney John Williams was planning to meet with Jericho's parents Monday to discuss legal options.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to be learned in the law to know in your heart that it's wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;Now you have to be punished because you excel at something?&quot; 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
I'm not a big sports fan, but this is pretty sad.  I can understand the thoughts, but I can't believe they actually followed through and told him he couldn't pitch.</div>

			<hr />
			
				DENVER (CNN) - As Comedy Central's &quot;Daily Show&quot; descends on Denver for four days of coverage, Jon Stewart took after the &quot;established&quot; media for getting too cozy with candidates and regurgitating campaign spin when it comes to political coverage.<br />
<br />
In a breakfast with reporters, Stewart directed most of his ire at the 24-hour cable news networks, which he called &quot;gerbil wheels,&quot; and said the media at-large had &quot;abdicated&quot; to what he called the &quot;slow-witted beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said the never-ending television news cycle creates a &quot;false sense of urgency&quot; and forces reporters to &quot;follow the veins that have been mined,&quot; instead of pursuing serious and in-depth reporting.<br />
<br />
Even as Stewart shredded reporters for, in his estimation, getting too cozy with and used by political candidates, he readily admitted that candidates flock to his show to attract his much sought after younger audience. &quot;It's just one part of their sales pitch,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Stewart said he found neither Sens. McCain or Obama particularly funny and it was &quot;absolutely irrelevant&quot; which one takes the White House because &quot;the jokes will be there.&quot; He dismissed criticism that comedians are having a hard time joking about Obama because of his race and said &quot;the age joke with McCain is somewhat meaningless because it's already trite.&quot;<br />
<br />
The choice of Joe Biden as Obama's runningmate, Stewart said, was refreshing because of the Delaware senator's large personality and endless possibility for jokes. &quot;Biden is really nice. His style is so effusive and unguarded,&quot; Stewart said. &quot;He's emotion plus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stewart said politicians in recent campaigns are &quot;animatronic&quot; because all of the &quot;humanity has been managed out of campaigns.&quot; He referenced the back-and-forth during the Pennsylvania Democratic primary over Obama's lack of bowling skills.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's stunning where this election is going to be decided on,&quot; he said. &quot;Or what we allow it to be decided on.&quot;

I'm flying in Saturday around noon and fly out Monday morning. Beyond Voca's talk at 5:30 on Sunday I'm fairly open. 
 
Post here and let's figure out when we can meet!]]></description>

<br />
We're a new guild pushing t5 (Hydross and Lurker downed 1-shot on our first trip in yesterday).  There's been a bit of turnover but not much.  As a safety leadership decided to use a "bank points" system.  When you put something in you get points based on the AH value of the donation.  Withdrawals are subtracted from your points.<br />
<br />
Obviously this is a monumental task for the person in charge.<br />
<br />
<u>Is there a mod out there that'll allow, at the very least, a way to download the guild bank logs?</u>  If we had that ability it's easy to massage the data in Access/Excel.  All I've been able to find is inventory mods.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />
BT</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Mom bought us a 6lb trimmed brisket this weekend, so I'm cooking it today.  I don't have a smoker or grill to use, so I have to cook it in the oven the way she always has.  Nothing fancy as far as spices go, just garlic salt on both sides, and a little bit of fresh ground black pepper on top (mom doesn't put pepper on it).  I'm about to put it in the 250 degree oven, and in about 8 hours or so we'll have a large hunk of delicious meat. :D<br />
<br />
How do you cook/season your brisket?</div>
