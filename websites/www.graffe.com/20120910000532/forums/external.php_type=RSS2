			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>OK, what is the trick to this event?  It's level 15, but even when I was level 15 you get knocked down/one-shotted over and over and over.<br />
<br />
It's a massive fire elemental that spawns tons of Embers and sprays fire eruptions all over.  It's insane.  Whoever designed this event should be roasted... <br />
<br />
But seriously, is there a way to survive long enough to even get across the bridge into the room?  Or is the trick to massively over level it and hope your higher level gear protects you?</div>

			<b>Disillusioned Obama Supporter In Romney Ad Is Actually GOP Staffer</b><br />
<br />
Republicans debuted a new ad Thursday in which a frustrated former Obama supporter expresses her disappointment with the president. The only problem: The woman in the video is actually an RNC staffer.<br />
...<br />
Inclan began her current RNC post in January 2012, and has worked in Republican politics since well before Obamas 2008 election.
