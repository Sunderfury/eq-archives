I cannot log into Graffes with Firefox, I keep getting the following error:<br />

<div class="bbcode_container">

			The connection was reset<br />
        <br />
          The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading.<br />
        <br />
  The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few<br />
    moments.<br />
  If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network<br />
    connection.<br />
  If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure<br />
    that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

	</div>
</div>I can log out and back in with IE8 no problems, but if i immediately try it with FF, it errors out. I can browse forums fine, just not logged in. <br />
<br />
Ideas?</div>
