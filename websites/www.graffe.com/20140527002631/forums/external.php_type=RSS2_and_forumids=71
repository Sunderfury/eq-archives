STEAM IN-HOME STREAMING<br />
PUT YOUR PC TO WORK.<br />

WITH STEAM IN-HOME STREAMING<br />
<br />
When you log into Steam on two computers on the same network, they automatically connect, allowing you to remotely install, launch, and play games as though you were sitting at the remote PC.<br />
<br />
When you play a game using In-Home Streaming, video and audio are sent through your home network from your high-end gaming PC to another device in your home.<br />
<br />
From here, your keyboard, mouse, and controller input is sent back to the remote computer.<br />
It all happens in milliseconds. With good hardware and a fast home network, you’ll forget the game is running remotely.<br />

What is Steam In-Home Streaming?<br />
<br />
Steam in-home streaming allows you to play a game on one computer when the game process is actually running on another computer elsewhere in your home. Through Steam, game audio and video is captured on the remote computer and sent to the player’s computer. The game input (keyboard, mouse or gamepad) is sent from the player’s computer to the game process on the remote computer.<br />
<br />
Any two computers in a home can be used to stream a gameplay session and this can enable playing games on systems that would not traditionally be able to run those games. For example, a Windows only game could be streamed from a Windows PC to a Steam Machine running Linux in the living room. A graphically intensive game could be streamed from a beefy gaming rig in the office to your low powered laptop that you are using in bed. You could even start a game on one computer and move to a more comfortable location and continue playing it there.<br />
<br />
Overview of streaming from a PC to a Steam Machine<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
How do I use it?<br />
<br />
    Opt into the Steam client beta on two computers.<br />
    Login to the Steam beta client on both computers with the same account.<br />
    Go to the computer where you want to play and start playing your game.<br />
<br />
How do I improve my streaming experience?<br />
<br />
Hardware:<br />
We recommend a minimum of a quad-core CPU for the computer running the game. The client has more modest requirements, but should have a GPU that supports hardware accelerated H264 decoding. Any recent laptop or PC should meet the client requirements.<br />
<br />
Network:<br />
We recommend using a wired network for the best streaming experience. People have had some success with powerline networks and wireless N and AC networks with good signal, though your experience may vary.<br />
<br />
Game Settings:<br />
To improve your streaming experience, you can go into your game settings and lower your resolution and turn off vertical sync.<br />
<br />
Steam Settings:<br />
In the In-Home Streaming settings you can change a number of things that can affect your experience. You can change your preference for speed vs quality, limit the network bandwidth, and adjust the maximum capture resolution.<br />
<br />
Is there a community group?<br />
<br />
Yes, you can join the Steam In-Home Streaming community group and discuss the feature with thousands of other players.<br />
<br />
Known issues<br />
<br />
General:<br />
<br />
    There is currently no indication of whether Steam is able to bind the discovery port 27036, but if that fails no other computers will show up in the remote computer list in the In-Home Streaming settings.<br />
    If a game takes a long time to launch, it will time out on the client but will start anyway. Retrying the launch will connect to the running game. If this happens consistently for any particular game, please report it on the bug discussion group.<br />
    If your game loses focus, Steam will start streaming the desktop so that you can get back to it. This is a feature of Steam In-Home Streaming.<br />
    Streaming non-Steam games in the Steam library may work but is not officially supported.<br />
    Surround sound is not currently supported and is converted to stereo.<br />
    Voice recording over streaming is not currently supported.<br />
    Streaming may not perform well when streaming to older systems with a single or dual core CPU and no hardware accelerated H264 decoding.<br />
<br />
Windows:<br />
<br />
    Streaming from a Windows XP host is not supported.<br />
    UAC dialogs prevent streaming. If you're a game developer, please avoid requiring elevated permissions to run your game.<br />
<br />
Mac OS X:<br />
<br />
    Streaming from a Mac OS X host is not yet supported.<br />
<br />
SteamOS / Linux:<br />
<br />
    Streaming from a Linux host is not yet supported.<br />
    In order to support streaming game controllers on a Linux host computer, /dev/uinput or /dev/input/uinput needs to be readable and writable by Steam.<br />
<br />
The computers don't see each other<br />
<br />
Make sure they are on the same subnet and no other program is using port 27036, which is used for the initial discovery protocol. If another program has bound this port, please report which program it is on the bug discussion group.<br />
<br />
I haven't updated video drivers<br />
<br />
A number of bugs have been fixed in the latest video driver releases that may affect streaming. If you are getting poor performance, graphical glitches or black screens please make sure you have the latest drivers installed from your video card vendor's website.<br />
<br />
I get &quot;The streaming client exited unexpectedly (2)&quot;<br />
<br />
You can look in the streaming client log to get more details about what happened. On Windows this file is on the local computer in streaming_client.exe.log. On Linux this file is on the local computer in /tmp/streaming_client.log.<br />
<br />
Steam crashes or black screen when hosting from an NVIDIA laptop<br />
<br />
There is a bug in the NVIDIA driver which causes a crash or black screen if you're streaming from a laptop with Windows 8.1. Try opening the NVIDIA control panel and under 3D settings, set Steam to use integrated graphics.<br />
<br />
I see a black screen when streaming a game.<br />
<br />
Please try updating your video drivers. If this doesn't fix it, please report which program it is on the bug discussion group.<br />
<br />
I don't hear any audio when streaming a game.<br />
<br />
    See if there is an audio error listed in logs\streaming_log.txt on the remote computer<br />
    See if audio or the Steam application is muted on the remote computer<br />
    See if audio is muted on the local computer<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
How do I diagnose streaming performance problems?<br />
<br />
You can look in logs\streaming_log.txt on the remote computer after you play a game to get a detailed breakdown of how much time was spent in each component of the streaming system.<br />
<br />
While the game is running, you can hit F6 or the Guide button combined with the Y button on your game controller to turn on live statistics for the session. While the statistics are visible the game collects more detailed information which is saved in logs\SteamVideoTrace.txt and logs\SteamAudioTrace.txt at the end of the session.<br />
<br />
While the statistics are visible, you can hit F8 or the Guide button combined with the X button on your game controller to save a screenshot and 10 seconds worth of stats to a zip file in the streaming directory in the Steam folder on the remote computer.<br />
<br />
There is a good article on how to interpret the log information here: <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/0/540733523404402134/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://steamcommunity.com/groups/hom...3523404402134/</a></div>

			We*can report that multiple sources within Microsoft have been briefed on plans to make a long-awaited change to the Xbox Live Gold paywall for streaming media services.*According to our sources, Xbox 360 and Xbox One users will soon no longer need*a paid subscription to Xbox Live Gold to access Netflix, Hulu, and other streaming media apps.<br />
<br />
Additionally, we've been told that Xbox Live Gold may put other services behind the paywall to make up for this shift, though those sources could not confirm whether that includes existing services or*if that only includes upcoming content like*TV series from Xbox Entertainment Studios.<br />
<br />
The information has come to light thanks to ongoing discussions about the company's announcements at June's E3 games expo. At this point, it's important to note nothing is official, and Microsoft may change its mind before the*company's June 9 keynote. Either way, we've been told that the possible change in policy is directly linked to a changing of the Xbox guard after*Don Mattrick left the company to become Zynga's CEO.<br />
<br />
Microsoft's major console rivals, Nintendo and Sony, have never charged a monthly fee for access to streaming media apps on their systems. Popular media boxes like Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV have also increased*the pressure on Microsoft to follow suit.<br />
<br />
We have reached out to Microsoft requesting official comment on the story and will update this post if there's a response.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've been meaning to post updated impressions on the Vita for a few months now but always end up forgetting. Sony is launching a new model of this with a longer battery life (by dropping the OLED) so figured now was a good time to bump the thread.<br />
<br />
Edit: I remembered bumping old threads causes Nadiar headaches. I wasn't sure how old a thread had to be to cause problems so went ahead and made a new one. You can find the original: <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?76274-The-Vita-the-best-console-you-aren-t-playing-and-why-you-should" target="_blank">here</a><br />
<br />
<br />
So, I love Nintendo handhelds. I love Nintendo games. But I think I like my Vita more than my 3DS. The interface is great. Downloading things from PSN is incredibly easy. PS+ itself is fantastic. I haven't even gotten around to playing the &quot;big&quot; titles like Soul Sacrifice yet, I've just been playing the lower tier titles in idle moments. It's just extremely convenient with how many games you can fit on one of the decently sized memory cards. I've sadly just about filled up mine though.<br />
<br />
The 3DS does do a few things better. Ignoring how you feel about Nintendo's games, the games themselves are easier to swap in and out. The power cable is smaller and connects to the top so it's easier to play while charging. The battery life is a little better (I think).<br />
<br />
The battery life on the 3DS never bothered me, but I did have to cut a Guacamelee session on my Vita short because of it. I ended up buying a portable charging battery as a result. It's pretty great. The only downside is that it charges kind of slowly, but if you absolutely can't wait you can play with it plugged in, assuming you can put up with it being plugged in on the bottom. The headphone jack is also on the bottom, not a huge deal, but I find it to be kind of annoying.<br />
<br />
I never did get a special grip for the thing, since I wanted it to easily fit into my carrying case. I did eventually get used to the feel of it in my hands. My one remaining complaint is with the select and start buttons. They are sort of in a weird spot and are kind of hard to press. You can't accidentally pause this way, but it takes kind of a silly amount of effort to do so intentionally as a result.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I mentioned Guacamelee. I agree it's a fantastic game. Think I had a little bit of trouble with the controls though. That game's more advanced techniques require quite a bit of complicated contortions with your fingers. On a gamepad I think I would have been okay, but the buttons were kind of cramped for some of that crap.<br />
<br />
I also played Killzone Mercenary, which was also (surprisingly) fantastic. I ended up liking it far more than the PS3 games. Instead of being completely scripted, you were given the opportunity to choose your own loadouts for each mission (as well as being able to change them mid mission). The story is that you are a mercenary so you are fighting for money. The money you earn is how you pay for equipment, which varies between different kinds of guns and grenades, to body armor and trinkets. The trinkets are very expensive but also very cool. You can have a personal shield, a drone that scans enemies and lets you see through walls, a shoulder mounted rocket launcher, etc. They are really expensive though, so you won't get everything in one playthrough.<br />
<br />
Luckily the levels are designed with multiple playthroughs in mind. They had a little bit of variety and weren't just corridors, you had the option of stealth, etc etc. I don't know if this game was contracted out to another developer or what, but it would have been a great shooter on any system, let alone a handheld one.<br />
<br />
Haven't really played much else of note on it, just short sessions in some of the PS+ freebies. Sonic Racing is pretty good. The Urban Trials stunt bike game was okay. Stuff like that. Every month in PS+ gets you two more Vita freebies. It's a pretty easy way of always having something to play on it, and since Vita titles tend to be smaller than PS3 titles, it's a pretty convenient device to use with digital games. If it weren't for the memory card situation I would treat it like a PC and go full digital without ever looking back.<br />
<br />
P.S. I never mentioned it before, but I'm glad you liked Persona 4: Golden Maledict. I know we go back and forth about jrpgs sometimes, but Persona 4 was probably my favorite in years. I'm not sure if there was anything for the PS3 that even came close. I'm looking forward to experience it again with Golden.</div>

			<b>Introduction:</b> Gnostica is an abstract territory based war game. Tarot cards make up the often-changing board, and players use Icehouse pieces to represent minions that control those territories. Every tarot card has a power, and when a player has one of his pieces on a territory, he or she may use the power of that territory through that piece. Players also have a hand of tarot cards which allow them to use those powers through any of their pieces. Territories are worth points when occupied, and the game ends when one player challenges the other players and has 9 points on his or her following turn.

	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			<b>Turn options:</b> If you have no pieces on the board, you may only put a small piece in any orientation on any empty territory or wasteland. Otherwise, do one of the following, keeping in mind that all powers are optional:<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Activate a card on the board. All your pieces on that card are &quot;minions&quot; and any one of them may use the power of that card, or even two of them if there are two powers on that card.</li><li style="">Play a card from your hand to the discard pile. All your pieces on the board are &quot;minions&quot; and any of them may use the power of that card, or even two of them if there are two powers on that card.</li><li style="">Discard any or none of your cards to the discard pile and then take new cards from the draw pile until you have 6 cards in your hand. You may take fewer cards if you wish.</li><li style="">Orient one piece.</li></ul>

</div>One-page <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/icehouse/GnosticaRulesRef.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Gnostica Rules Reference</a> (pdf).  Very handy during gameplay.<br />
<br />
Gameplay is simple and deep.  Each turn usually presents a variety of options that all have potentially meaningful consequences and usually represent varying degrees of risk based on what other players intend to do.  Diplomacy is also an inherent feature.  It's fantastic to play with 4 people.  You can coordinate (and even perhaps bargain) with other players regularly.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>May is looking to be the last big hurrah before summer doldrums kick in. There are a couple of notable titles coming out this month which will likely be the biggest releases until later this year.<br />
<br />
The big one is surely <b>Watch Dogs</b>. It was originally supposed to come out shortly after GTA 5 last year, but Ubisoft delayed it in an effort to expand its content. My expectation is that this will be the difference between Assassin's Creed 1 and 2, between having a prototype and having a fully fledged game. Still, I think some people might be let down due to unrealistic expectations.<br />
<br />
The second most important release this month will arguably be <b>Mario Kart 8</b>. Nintendo is already pushing it pretty hard, no doubt gambling on it improving their position with the Wii U. Mario Kart has long been one of their best selling franchises, appealing to core and casual alike. <br />
<br />
But that's not all, the new <b>Wolfenstein</b> game comes out this month, the PS3 gets action rpg <b>Drakengard 3</b>, and the new game from the makers of Bastion, <b>Transistor</b>, comes out on PC and PS4.<br />
<br />
On the handheld front, this month Sony launches their new Vita model, along with a port of Borderlands 2. The 3DS meanwhile gets a new kirby game and mario golf.<br />

<br />
Here's the complete list: <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/04/28/golden-week-sale-celebrates-japanese-games-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blog.us.playstation.com/2014/...anese-games-2/</a><br />
<br />
A few highlights include Chrono Cross for $3.50 and Tales of Symphonia for $10. Also discounted but not part of the promotion is Vagrant Story for $3 and Tactics Ogre for $10. Note that the best discounts go to people with PS+ subscriptions.<br />
<br />
I picked up Chrono Cross and Vagrant Story. Was considering trying an Atelier game, but they aren't discounted enough to pique my curiosity.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Playing through this again after more than a decade.  Might have some more comprehensive thoughts at some point but for now:<br />
<br />
Story-wise, it's still pretty good.  Not great, but good enough to keep me engaged for several hours on a plane ride.  The decision to start the game in Midgar and spend most of the first 5-10 hours of the game in restricted set of dingy, dismal areas (slums, reactors, sewers, and piles of rubble) or the complete opposite (Shinra headquarters) was an interesting decision, given that it puts off one of the core gameplay features (world map exploration) for so long.  While I question it from a game design perspective, I must admit it was a pretty good way to start off the story.  <br />
<br />
The game's introduction is superb.  It's perhaps one of the best in the series.  No lengthy expository segment, no gratuitous visuals.  After two minutes, they've foreshadowed Aeris and the Lifestream, established the setting of Midgar, introduced Avalanche, and introduced Cloud.  You take control of him immediately (after a the terse &quot;C'mon newcomer, follow me!&quot; from Barret), with full access to the party menu, then are in combat moments later.  The first mission ends with a large explosion.<br />
<br />
Really, it doesn't get better than that.  Contrast with, say, Final Fantasy XII...<br />
<br />
But ugh, the minigames.  Most of them are downright awful.  I hate them and hate every gamer who likes them.  Except for the motorcycle segment (which was tolerable), the chocobo racing (which was just boring) and the snowboarding (which I think I liked), I don't remember ANY of them.  They are not remotely memorable, they are nothing but annoying.<br />
<br />
There's also a lot of minor but tedious delays everywhere.  Part of this was playstation limitations I think, but battle introductions are 8-9 seconds as opposed to 2 seconds on the SNES.  (For reference, FFIX's battle intro sequences are a whopping 15 seconds).  Menus take a long time to open.  Zone transitions take a long time.  The summon spells are famous for being long.  It all adds up.  And then, while the pre-rendered 2D backgrounds are gorgeous, they're much harder to navigate than the old grid-based JRPG format.  It's much smoother than it could be, but still gets annoying at times.</div>

When I was replaying Demon Souls (PS3) I realized the primary reason I found the controller so annoying was that it was convex, exactly opposite of the surface of my thumbs which is fairly high on the retarded design meter.</div>
