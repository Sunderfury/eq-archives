			A few weeks ago, the news that 17 cell phone towers of unknown origin shot around the Internet faster than the latest stolen celebrity nude photos. Since then, a variety of publications have launched their own investigations and they are finding a whole lot more towers, but not their owners.<br />
<br />
Les Goldsmith, CEO of ESD America, the company behind the secure phones that first discovered the mystery towers, told VentureBeat he's found 18 towers in and around the Washington D.C. area. And who does Goldsmith think is behind it? “It’s highly unlikely that federal law enforcement would be using mobile interceptors near the Senate. My suspicion is that it is a foreign entity,&quot; he told VB.<br />
<br />
Goldsmith said two kinds of interceptors have been identified: IMSI Catchers, which can steal subscriber info, and GSM Interceptors, which can listen into calls. Goldsmith added that a complete interceptor includes both capabilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Separately, The Blaze has also found intercept devices, which are not cell towers and can be as small as a briefcase, around the Russian embassy. &quot;In several locations including on Pennsylvania Avenue in downtown D.C. someone is operating a full-blown intercept where whenever you walk past they actually break open your communications and look at what’s going on on the device,&quot; Aaron Turner, president of Integricell, a company that specializes in mobile security, told The Blaze.<br />
<br />
Goldsmith, who also talked to The Blaze, said there are three tell-tale signs that phone calls are being intercepted: Your phone thinks it only has the option to talk to one cell tower; the deceptive one, the phone is forced to downgrade from 4G/3G to the simpler, unsecured 2G service; and standard network cyphering is disabled on the phone.<br />
<br />
What's really disturbing about all of this is there does not seem to be any concern beyond the tech press. There do not seem to be any investigations or for that matter, anyone going to the devices they've detected to see what it is. Even scarier is how they got there in the first place. That someone could set up these interceptors and no one noticed does not give me a great sense of comfort. Goldsmith's comment that they are of foreign origin should scare the daylights out of Congress, even if they have all gone home to campaign for re-election.<br />
<br />
Something has to be done, and the first thing should be taking these interceptors down, disassembling them and finding out where the information they capture is being sent. Why no one is doing that right now is beyond me.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>But as a result of being so busy, I just got a FANTASTIC new position at a location far closer to home for a bunch of extra money.<br />
<br />
I have now moved on from general IT stuff to a place that actually has upward mobility as an option in a reasonable amount of time and pays quite well.<br />
<br />
I've been here as a lurker since EZ-Board and a poster since 2002 or so, but over the years you guys have taught me a ton of stuff and caused me to mature, which is, in part, why I was able to obtain the job I just did.<br />
<br />
Thanks for being so awesome.<br />
<br />
I love you guys, even the ones I generally disagree with.<br />
<br />
Without the mental debates we typically have, I wouldn't be as cognitively sharp as I am, which is part of what got me to where I am now.<br />
<br />
&lt;3 You all.</div>

			This morning in Japan, Square Enix announced a new subsidiary specializing in cloud gaming. The business is named Shinra Technologies, after the antagonistic corporation from Final Fantasy VII, and will be headed by former Square Enix CEO Yoichi Wada.<br />
<br />
Shinra is in conversations with developers to make use of its services, no specifics have yet been offered. It’s unclear so far what sets Shinra apart from other cloud gaming options like OnLive and PlayStation Now.<br />
<br />
The service is scheduled to go into technical beta in early 2015 in Japan. North America will get its turn later in the year.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I may be missing a thread somewhere but I don't recall a discussion about audio books. I have a small commute each day so I've taken to listening to them during that time. So far, I'm  really only listening to ones where I've read and liked the book but I may be willing to branch out some. I know a lot of these can be ruined by a poor narrator. Anyone listen to these and have some suggestions for what I should try after my current selection is done? Currently I've gone through the following:<br />
<br />
1. Demon Cycle by Peter V. Brett - Absolutely love the books and the audio books are just as good.<br />
2. Iron Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearne - Currently my favorite urban fantasy series but the voice acting turns me off.<br />
3. Ready Player One by Ernest Cline - Loved the book. Narration by Wil Wheaton. Originally I was hesitant about this but does a really good job at narration.<br />
4. Robopocalypse by Daniel Wilson - Loved the book. Narration was decent enough that I enjoyed the listen.<br />
<br />
I'm currently thinking of moving to the Night Angel or Legend of Drizzt series after this but I'm a bit underwhelmed about those choices. Anyone have any other recommendations?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, if you clicked on this thread, you are more than likely a zombie-genre fan. Whether from the original Romero, to perhaps the inspired Rabies/Voodo fiction, or maybe just from the Walking Dead-verse. <br />
<br />
For me, it was the Zombie Survival Guide written by Max Brooks that started the fascination for me. A fantastic book, for a fantastic concept that was well thought out, had very little narrative (really none) and really let the imagination fill in all the interesting pieces into my own story. <br />
<br />
While I enjoy the walking dead (and have read all the comic books), the question of voices, players, people - it all has been made easier for me by appearing on the screen.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.werealive.com/listen/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Enter: We're Alive - A Story of Survival - The Podcast.</a><br />
<br />
This pretty cool radio-style drama first broadcast in 2009. A good year before The Walking Dead television series landed on AMC. It draws inspiration (possibly?) from the Comic book, but it is so well crafted, it could definitely stand on its own. <br />
<br />
If you like zombies, I highly recommend giving this a listen. Go to your smartphone. Download a podcast app (I prefer podcast addict), subscribe to it and download all the episodes. Or go to the website, and download all the episodes in mp3 form directly. Load 'em up and enjoy. <br />
<br />
It is better than books on tape. Amazing voice actors and actresses. An easy world to envision (even moreso if you live in or are familiar with los angeles), and just a whole lot of fun. <br />
<br />
I'm not done with it yet, but I'm in the middle of the season that started getting the attention of the big award givers, and it received several. <br />
<br />
Hope you fellow Zombie Geeks enjoy this as much as I.</div>

			<b>UPDATED, Sept. 24, 10:48 a.m. ET:</b> The nude photo leak threat targeting Emma Watson earlier this week turned out to be a viral marketing stunt by a site calling itself Rantic Marketing. Rantic claims to want to shut down the website 4chan, but the &quot;social media marketing enterprise&quot; may itself just be a hoax.<br />
<br />
The original website surrounding the false leaks, EmmaYouAreNext.com, threatened to release nude photographs of the 24-year-old actress and included a clock counting down to Saturday at midnight ET. The person who posted the website said it was in retaliation for Watson's well-received speech that she gave at the United Nations on Sept. 20.<br />
<br />
However, by midnight on Wednesday, the URL redirected to Rantic Marketing's website. Watson's face and the countdown clock has been replaced with a banner that says, &quot;#shutdown4chan&quot; and an open letter to President Barack Obama that claims celebrity publicists hired the marketing company to popularize a call for Internet censorship and the end of 4chan. <br />
<br />
Initially, the threats were reportedly posted on the anonymous, forum-based website 4chan, which was previously the center of previous celebrity photo hacks.<br />
<br />
An earlier version of Rantic's website claimed to have worked with such companies as McDonald's and Rockstar Games. Mashable has reached out to those companies for comment.<br />
<br />
It is still unknown if Rantic Marketing is a real company or if the Rantic website is simply another stunt in itself. Mashable reached out to Rantic via the email address on its website, but the message was returned as a failure. Business Insider attributed Rantic to &quot;the most notorious gang of pranksters on the Internet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rantic listed &quot;Brad Cockingham&quot; as its CEO and founder, but no further information about that name could be found.<br />
<br />
A Reddit thread posted on Tuesday outed Rantic Marketing as being the source for the EmmaYouAreNext.com website, and pointed to a pastebin document where someone going by &quot;Gammarays&quot; connected Rantic to the threats as well as the online magazine Foxweekly.com.<br />
<br />
According to the document, Rantic.com, EmmaYouAreNext.com and FoxWeekly.com are all &quot;hosted on the same server or share at least one server in common.&quot; <br />
<br />
However an update to the pastebin claimed that the server status resource had been removed from the website. Mashable has not yet confirmed this claim.<br />
<br />
<b>UPDATE</b>: The /server-status resource was removed from the server about the same time a series of cryptic tweets were made on the @RanticMarketing Twitter account. <br />
<br />
Foxweekly was one of the first websites to blame 4chan for creating the threatening website. However, Foxweekly provided no evidence to verify that claim.<br />
<br />
According to the Reddit thread, Foxweekly was previously known as Swenzy, and earlier SocialVEVO, both known for viral marketing pranks, including a similar countdown website surrounding a Family Guy hoax in 2013, the Daily Dot reports.

As a huge fan of the first season and both Matthew McConaughey and (to a lesser extent) Woody Harrelson's acting, I am very wary of this casting - particularly Vaughn, who I have never really cared for as an actor. The premise sounds intriguing (&quot;hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system&quot;) so I suppose I will reserve judgement until I see an episode or two.</div>

			<div class="message">Just entered this fat titty fuck burger into a shitty fucking contest. Ground sirloin, smoked chipotle mayo, lemon garlic butter on fucking everything, Parmesan charred romaine lettuce, and a Kim Kardashian nipple sized slice of smoked Gouda. Yeah Kim. I saw the leaked pictures. That nipple-to-tit ratio is all fucked up. Looks like someone duct taped some salami to a couple of rotten pumpkins. The nipples are almost bigger than the tit area.</div>

			Blizzard has officially canceled development on its mysterious next-generation massively multiplayer game Titan. The company confirmed the news to Polygon in a recent interview.<br />
<br />
This revelation comes after at least seven years in development and word last year that the developer was going back to the drawing board to reevaluate the project.<br />
<br />
Speaking to Polygon, Blizzard co-founder and CEO Mike Morhaime reiterated that the company has technically never officially announced Titan, though it hasn't been shy to talk about the game over the past seven years. &quot;We had created World of Warcraft, and we felt really confident that we knew how to make MMOs,&quot; Morhaime said. &quot;So we set out to make the most ambitious thing that you could possibly imagine. And it didn't come together.

</div>Forgot they were even working on it to be honest. But it's canceled now.</div>
