100% mana preservation (no cap)<br />
+100% crit damage<br />
1 minute duration<br />
60 minute reuse<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Crit chance caps out at about 25%.  So this would boost your DPS by about 13% (At near max raid gear and crit damage chance/multiplier) during that minute.<br />
<br />
It would give you 1 minute during which you could <b>burn</b>.<br />
<br />
Impact in XP groups:<br />
Suppose full-burn takes you OOM in 2 minutes.  Then 3.0 minutes to FM.<br />
<br />
This does 75% of the sustained DPS of the standard cycle of 3 minute burn 3 minute med to full.<br />
<br />
So in a 1 minute full burn with +13% damage you do ~42% of the damage that you would normally do in a 6 minute cycle.<br />
<br />
Over 1 hour, you would usually do 10 6 minute cycles.<br />
<br />
So this boosts your damage from 10x 1 cycle in 60 minutes to about 10.46x one cycle in 61 minutes.  Or a 2.9% boost in sustained DPS, roughly.<br />
<br />
Even if I underestimated this by 50%, that would still be less than a 6% boost in sustained DPS for wizards.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it grants an ability to <b>really really burst</b> in a situation without downsides, barring the 1 hour reuse.  You'd keep your aggro under control, and bring your mana down a tad in the front of the fight.  Then you might wait for a instant-recourse...<br />
<br />
Then tap Elemental Channeling, and full-burn with the highest DPS you possibly could over the 1 minute.  Screw concussion, screw anything but full all-out burn.<br />
<br />
When the 1 minute fades, your mana pool is another 1000 to 2000 points higher than it was when you started, and you switch back to your standard nuking tactics.<br />
<br />
Doing a PD then ECh is also neat, in that it is pretty mana-neutral.  PD costs more, ECh costs less.<br />

		<div>I think it is an interesting idea.  I also think I would like to hear if Nodyin could actually create and implement something like that on a wizard bot that he creates and have Prathun and himself run it hard thru the paces to see if all your numbers come out as expected.  They also have the ability to take an absolute base level Wizard with 100AA (or whatever the minimum to get the ability is) and low level bazaar gear compared to medium level (500AA with top end group gear) then compared to Top end Raid Wizard and see just how much difference in DPS it provides over the spectrum.<br />
<br />
This is only a &quot;what if&quot; type scenario and I don't know how hard it would be to create and try something like this.  Just for the sake of seeing how much of an increase would it really make and what would the top numbers be on that kind of full 1 minute burn with the current spell changes in effect.</div>

		<div>actually something that lets spells be 100% free would be good. melee discs are free so giving a caster a chance burst full damage like they do with no damage penalty laterwould be good. it would have to be a 20 min reuse though like a melee disc is, not this 36 min mc or blood magic stuff. :)<br />
<br />
sitll though should have  normal spells in 4.0 efficacy thats just even with melee bursting because cant use discs all the time.</div>

<br />
Say 1 hour 20 mins reuse (with AAs to reduce wait possibly) and add a more wizardy name! <br />
<br />
Alternatively, 1 hour reuse and only 75% mana pres. And a more wizardy name!<br />
<br />
Other alternative is for it to be 36 min reuse, 100% mana pres and only last for 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Then only problem I see with it, is that it completely cancels the benifit of PD. Not only would it be roughly the same recast (I think? Been ages since I've used PD), but it'd be better in every other way.<br />
<br />
Similar suggestion would be to have a disc that only affected certain elementals, fire, cold, magic. Consumption of Ro, Consumption of Druzzil, Consumption of Eci. Each with a reuse timer of 1 hour 20 mins, but not on the same timer (or 36 mins and on the same timer). And they could each have a negative effect on the other forms of spells.<br />
Consumption of Ro would make your cold nukes hit for 50% dmg, while your fire nukes would hit for 150% dmg. <br />
Consumption of Eci could grant 50% increased mana pres for cold nukes and 50% increased mana use for fire nukes. <br />
Consumption of Druzzil could decrease resist rates and increase crit rate for magic nukes, but increase resist rate for fire and cold.</div>

		<div>question for yak, what do you think could be done to up wiz damage to about rogue level without making us depend on a bunch of easy buttons, which basically turns us into a melee class? <br />

i still think there is allot to be gained from the manabar and gear before going to this extream. :)</div>

Nodyin also said flat out in that thread, that PD was meant for grouping and to harm long-term sustained dps (at the expense of burst). This is where it's very different from melee discs. Pretty much all dps melee discs I know of, are useful in both raid, group and hell, even solo (most of them), situations... our one is not. <br />
<br />
Another &quot;proof&quot; to me, that the discripancy between melee and caster dps in raid situations, occur because the devs balance the numbers around an average/mean that isn't realistic.</div>

At the moment mana disk look very appealing because spell manacost is totaly out of whack. However, disk is a band aid for this problem. Spells are what needs to be looked at.<br />

Disks are the only way that our burst DPS will scale to other classes. They need to be DPS disks.<br />

This means they have to boost combination of 3 things. Base dmg, chance to crit, and size of critical hits.<br />

				 This AA, much like Mana Burn, isn't tuned for a raid situation. You're right - in a Raid situation you'd be worse off by using this. In a group situation you can fire this off when something needs to die RIGHT NOW. Also in a group situation you are more likely to soon see an OOC regen chance after using this AA which helps (now, at least) to offset the cost in mana for this ability.<br />

				My Response: There is a difference between &quot;tuning/intent&quot; and the functional use that players find for an AA. I'll tell you flat out that ALL AAs are tuned for the group game. We are not able to &quot;tune&quot; an AA to provide a large oomph against a raid encounter without making an AA that would trivialize group content. For example a 32K nuke would barely scratch a boss mob in Solteris but would be amazing for grouping or soloing.

So, if ALL AAs are tuned for group content, while discs are tuned with raid content in mind, you have your imbalance right there. I suspect they aren't, though.</div>

Fact is Prathun spends lions share of his time tuning raids and not our spells. You tell me what are the GD raids for?</div>

i really doubt that. the whole nuke system in general just seem behind even for the big ones and non wizard nukes don't even have a chance when in the past they did. look at dots and that system works out really well for its targeted class. so well that's its like even with nukes now. <br />
<br />
i bet if worn mana regen were massively upped, and either 75-100% crit rate or 25% base damage bump, or ooc enabled on raids during combat and would be vary close to that level without the need to turn for for easy buttons to do the damage for ya. :)</div>

The issue with anything allows constant upgraded damage is it makes lower tier wizards massively out damage thier melee counterparts outside of raids.  This is an unacceptable answer for the developers.  Hence disipline style effects to achieve raid balance without messing up group balance.</div>

		<div>screw group content, raid content should be balaned 1st but if its going to be a problem than 2 easy things can do so its not a problem anymore<br />
1) longer to get in ooc state, maybe a 1-2 min tash type resource from any nuke<br />
2) better yet just let wizards ooc mana during combat. that would open many more strategies and junk.<br />
3) now no can balance the spells without worry that one type of play will be unbalanced.<br />
<br />
spells are still behind what it should be, even if we had a  disc for the raid game, though.</div>

If the devs are tuning around group content (as stated above), arguments that involve &quot;screwing group content&quot; is unlikely to have any ground to stand on, imho. Rather, we should demonstrate to the devs, that a long re-use disc (or a short re-use disc with reduced effect) would not seriously overpowered us in a grouping situation, but give us the edge we lack in a burst burn raid situation. <br />
<br />
And the whole &quot;Gimme more mana, gimme free ooc all the time&quot;, sounds to me as a &quot;I want to be able to chain instants and EI throughout a fight, allow me this and I might be satisfied&quot;, which is going in a completely different direction  to what the devs have -insisted- on taking us.<br />
<br />
I'm dubious to the whole thing though until I get a chance to parse more fights (only done two of any use, non of which were really burst burn fights). With the fights I've parsed so far, it seems as if I'm pretty well-balanced with my melee peers atm, and shifting that in either direction wouldn't be fair (and would threatend to overpower solo abilities, I suspect). So perhaps it is really just the high-end that requires tuning at this point.</div>
