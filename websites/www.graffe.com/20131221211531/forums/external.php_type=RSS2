Lesbian teen bullied, forced to use boys' room, sues school district. Photo of Destin Holmes.<br />
Teachers and students bullied this lesbian teen ‘to the point of suicide,’ called her vile names, and forced her to use the boys’ bathroom. Now she’s suing. Photo of Destin Holmes screen captured from WLOX 13 News footage.<br />

Teachers and students bullied this lesbian teen “to the point of suicide.”<br />
<br />
When will people learn that bullying children is NEVER okay? Teachers and students bullied this lesbian teen “to the point of suicide,” called her vile names, and forced her to use the boys’ bathroom. Now she’s suing. WLOX 13 News reports that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has filed a federal lawsuit against the Moss Point School District in Mississippi on behalf of Destin Holmes, a lesbian high school student.<br />
<br />
WLOX 13 News’ on-air broadcast (shown below) adds that Holmes’ schoolmates cruelly taunted her with anti-lesbian epithets like, “dyke,” “lesbo” and “dyke-ass freak.” Her teachers behaved even worse. One made her use the boys’ bathroom. Another teacher had the lesbian teen come in for a “talk” during which Holmes was called a “pathetic fool,” and told “I don’t want a dyke in this school.”<br />
<br />
<br />
“My grades sucked, because it was hard to concentrate with them calling you a freak, and a dyke and a lesbian.”<br />
 – Destin Holmes, on why she’s suing her school district.<br />
<br />
Anjali Nair, a lawyer from the SPLC adds:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“Destin suffered from severe, pervasive harassment from students, teachers, and administrators in the district on account of her sexual orientation,”<br />
<br />
Here’s the video, with WLOX 13 News’ report on the SPLC’s lawsuit on behalf of this lesbian teen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The school district was warned. Now their lesbian teen is fighting back.<br />
<br />
The anti-lesbian bullying started in the 2011-12 school year when Holmes was in middle school. Her parents took her out, home schooled her for a year, then re-enrolled her in high school this year. Alas, the high school’s climate for lesbians was no better than the one in middle school. WLOX 13 News explains that the Moss Point School District had ample warning that this lawsuit was coming. Back in March, the SPLC sent a letter demanding that the district change school policies to protect the civil rights of their lesbian, gay, bi, and transgender students and keep them safe. The school district made no attempt to comply, so the SPLC filed a lawsuit. Nair told WLOX 13 News.<br />
<br />
<br />
“After sending the school district a demand letter in March of 2013, that they take steps to prevent and end the bullying and harassment within the school district, we were not able to reach a resolution to guarantee the safety of students like Destin.”<br />
<br />
The lawsuit demands that a stronger set of anti-bullying measures to be put in place, and also seeks money to cover all the damage suffered by Holmes and her parents due to the constant anti-lesbian bullying.<br />
<br />
And what does Destin Holmes have to say about all of this?<br />
<br />
When asked about the anti-lesbian bullying and what Destin Holmes wants from her teachers and classmates in school, Holmes answered that she wants them to:<br />
<br />
“Open up their mind and realize you don’t need to bully somebody just because they want to date girls or they want to be gay, or they want to be lesbian, or bi, or a transgender. I’m hoping it will just stop.”<br />
<br />
Here at AI, we’d like people to “open up their minds” too. We’d also like people to stop bullying children. Lesbian teens aren’t the only kids who suffer from bullies and the adults who  condone them. We like to think this sort of thing only happens in the deep south, but the fact is, it’s happening all over the country.<br />
&#9726;An autistic teen from Des Moines, IA was bullied at school, and the parents and teachers said the poor kid deserved it.<br />
&#9726;A seven-year-old black girl from Tulsa, OK was sent home from school because her hair was too “distracting.”<br />
&#9726;A Florida teen killed herself after being bullied online by her schoolmates and told that she should “drink bleach and die.”<br />
&#9726;A Texas school snatched away a 12-year-old boy’s lunch, and threw it in the garbage because he didn’t have 30 cents to pay for it.<br />
&#9726;A high school football coach in Utah found out that his players had bullied other students and suspended the entire team. This is one of the few cases where meanness was not condoned by the adults.<br />
&#9726;A Texas school banned its Latino students from speaking Spanish while on school grounds.<br />
&#9726;A 13-year-old boy from Kansas was kicked out of school for wearing a purse.<br />
<br />
Our nation’s children have a legal right to get an education and to be safe at school. It’s sad that the only way to ensure that schools don’t treat children badly is to slap them with costly lawsuits.

			A marketing company purporting to sell lists of rape and domestic violence victims removed the lists from its website Wednesday after being contacted by The Wall Street Journal.<br />
<br />
<b>Medbase200, a Lake Forest, Ill., company that sells marketing information to pharmaceutical companies, had been offering a list of “rape sufferers” on its website, at a cost of $79 for 1,000 names.</b><br />
<br />
The company also removed lists of domestic violence victims, HIV/AIDS patients and “peer pressure sufferers” that it had been offering for sale, until it was contacted by the Journal.<br />
<br />
The rape-victims list was first disclosed by Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, at a Senate hearing Wednesday about the data-broker industry. Ms. Dixon could not be reached for comment after her testimony.<br />
<br />
The hearing was part of a Senate Commerce Committee investigation into the data-broker industry. In a report Wednesday, the committee said marketers maintain databases that purport to track and sell the names of people who have diabetes, depression, and osteoporosis, as well as how often women visit a gynecologist. The report said individuals don’t have a right to know what types of data the companies collect, how people are placed in categories, or who buys the information.<br />
<br />
Medbase200, a unit of Integrated Business Services Inc., sells lists of health-care providers and of people purportedly suffering from ailments such as diabetes and arthritis to pharmaceutical companies.<br />
<br />
In an interview, Integrated Business Services President Sam Tartamella initially denied that his company maintained or sold databases of rape victims. After the Journal provided him a link to the “rape sufferers” page, he said he would remove it from Medbase200&#8242;s website. The page was removed later Wednesday.<br />
<br />
In a subsequent email conversation, Tartamella said the company had never maintained an actual list of rape victims. “No one has ever leased, rented or otherwise acquired such a file from our firm, ever,” he said.<br />
<br />
He said a “hypothetical list of health conditions/ailments was used as a hypothetical” file for an internal test. “Apparently, that ‘test’ datacard was never removed after the website went live,” he wrote.<br />
<br />
Tartamella said he was combing through his company’s website to ensure “that other errors are not present.”<br />
<br />
To compile its lists of patients, Tartamella said the company used direct surveys, along with proprietary models that could not be shared.<br />
<br />
<b>Update: This post has been updated to reflect that Medscape200 also removed a list of HIV/AIDS patients that had been on its website.</b>

			LOS ANGELES - On Friday, there was a homecoming for an American soldier in Los Angeles.<br />
<br />
A predawn ceremony honored Army Sgt. Joseph Gantt, and the 95-year-old widow who waited to welcome him.<br />
<br />
Gantt died as a POW in Korea 62 years ago. Clara Gantt never stopped hoping that her husband would one day return home.<br />
<br />
What was she thinking that moment she stood over his coffin? <br />
<br />
&quot;He's here but not the way I want him to be here, but the Lord brought him home,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
Clara Gantt kept a shrine to her husband, Joseph, in the bedroom. He died as a prisoner of war in 1951, but his remains were not identified until last month.<br />
<br />
&quot;He told me if anything happened to him he wanted me to remarry, and I told him, 'No, no,'&quot; Clara Gantt said. &quot;So here I am, still his wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sgt. Gantt will be buried later this month. <br />
<br />
Why did she not give up hope despite the many years it took for his remains to be identified?<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn't make any difference,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn't give up hope for my husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
So she always thought this day would come? <br />
<br />
&quot;That's right,&quot; she said. &quot;So I'm happy that I'm still alive to bury him myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nearly 7,900 Americans who fought in Korea are still listed as missing in action.

<br />
No, I do not think Biggs was a &quot;hero&quot;, he was a petty crook, who should have got 5 to 15 years<br />
but, the great Train Robbers WERE unduly punished, because the Establishment bastards wanted to put the screws down on &quot;little folk&quot; who dared mess with the &quot;power of the state&quot;<br />
<br />
So, they got handed 30 year jail sentences, a complete perversion of the judicial process and THAT was utter f'ing bullshit.<br />
The robbers committed a serious crime, one guard was coshed left with a head injury, all of which merits as said, 5 to 15 years<br />
Instead they got hit with 30 years, a murder penalty!<br />
<br />
Then when Biggs came back to the UK, even in poor health, they were determined to get their &quot;pound of flesh&quot; and kept him in jail when he was suffering.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I have no love for scumbags, but Biggs was NOT one of the &quot;cosh&quot; men, and was a very minor player, who spent much of the robbery sitting at the sidelines cause the train driver friend he'd brought couldn't run the train they'd hijacked<br />
yet he spent more time in jail than any of them.<br />

			The 11 men sentenced all felt aggrieved at the sentences handed down, particularly Bill Boal (who died in prison) and Lennie Field, who were later found not guilty of the charges against them. The other men (aside from Wheater) resented what they considered to be the excessive length of the sentences, which were longer than those given to many murderers or armed robbers at the time. <br />
At that period, there was no parole system in place and prisoners served the full term of the sentence. Train robbers who were sentenced later, and by different judges, received shorter terms.<br />

Ronnie Biggs[edit]<br />
<br />
Biggs received a 30-year sentence following the robbery and served 15 months before escaping. He fled to Paris, where he acquired new identity papers and underwent plastic surgery. In 1970, he quietly moved to Adelaide, Australia, where he worked as a builder and lived a relatively normal life. He was tipped off by persons unknown and moved to Melbourne, later escaping to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after police discovered his Melbourne address. Biggs could not be extradited because there was no extradition treaty between Britain and Brazil, a condition for the Brazilian process of extradition. Additionally, he became father to a Brazilian son, which afforded him legal immunity since the father of a Brazilian minor can not be extradited from Brazil. As a result, he lived openly in Rio for many years, safe from the British authorities. In 1981, Biggs's Brazilian son became a member of a successful band Turma do Balão Mágico, bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son relatively short of funds again.<br />
<br />
In May 2001, aged 71 and having suffered three strokes, Biggs voluntarily returned to England. His son, Michael Biggs, said in a press release[42] that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs had not returned to the UK simply to receive free health care. According to Michael, health care was available in Brazil and he had many friends and supporters who would certainly have contributed to any such expenses. Biggs's stated desire was to &quot;walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter&quot;.[43] Biggs was aware that he would be arrested and jailed. After detention and a short court hearing he was sent back to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. He served another 8 years of his sentence.<br />
<br />
On 2 July 2009, Biggs was denied parole by Justice Secretary Jack Straw, who considered Biggs to be still &quot;wholly unrepentant.&quot;[44] Biggs has stated that the 30-year term was &quot;out of order&quot;[45] for the crime committed, and that is why he planned an escape.<br />
<br />
On 6 August 2009, Biggs was granted release from prison on &quot;compassionate grounds&quot; due to a severe case of pneumonia, after serving only part of the sentence imposed at trial.[46] Michael Biggs has said publicly that his father expressed remorse for the robbery, but not for his life on the run. By the time he was released he had served more jail time than any of the robbers, despite his relatively minor role.<br />
<br />
Since his release Biggs has updated his autobiography, Odd Man Out: The Last Straw (2011) (ISBN 978-0-9570398-2-7), which explains his role in the robbery and his life story. In 2013 Biggs contributed, along with Bruce Reynolds, to The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963-2013 (2013) (ISBN 0957255977), a publication that gave the most detailed account yet of the planning and execution of the robbery, and debunked many of the myths and legends surrounding the event.<br />
<br />
Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care home, London, aged 84, on the early morning of Wednesday 18 December 2013.<br />

please note, yesterday, a horrendous paedophile, guy who was front man for a successful band, got 35 years (though I see no reason why such monsters should ever get out of jail, personally)<br />
compared to Biggs 30....yeah.<br />
<br />
also realize, the cops were horrendously corrupt back then, much of &quot;Flying Squad&quot; (Sweeny) in London got turfed out some jailed in early 70s as example of how bad it was.<br />

			From 1978 to 1981 the name was changed to the Central Robbery Squad, but still known as the Flying Squad, they are often referred to by the nicknames the &quot;Heavy Mob&quot; or &quot;the Sweeney&quot;, rhyming slang for Flying Squad, (from Sweeney Todd).[1]<br />
<br />
This was the era in which the squad's close ties with the criminal fraternity, which had always been a necessary part of its strategy, were being exposed to public criticism. A number of scandals involving bribery and corruption were revealed, and on 7 July 1977, the squad's commander, Detective Chief Superintendent Kenneth Drury, was convicted on five counts of corruption and jailed for eight years. Twelve other officers were also convicted and many more resigned. These and other scandals led to a massive internal investigation by the Dorset Constabulary into the Metropolitan Police Service and the City of London Police, codenamed Operation Countryman.[

			Pennsylvania police this week were pulling people to the side of the road, quizzing them on their driving habits, and asking if they’d like to provide a cheek swap or a blood sample — the latest in a federally contracted operation that’s touted as making roads safer.<br />
<br />
The same operation took place last month at a community in Texas. Then, drivers were randomly told to pull off the road into a parking lot, where white-coated researchers asked if they’d like to provide DNA samples for a project that determines what percentage of drivers are operating under the influence of drugs or alcohol at given times.<br />
<br />
With uniformed police in the background, the researchers also offered the motorists money — up to $50 or so — for the blood or saliva samples.<br />
<br />
Apparently, next stop: Reading, Pa.<br />
<br />
Police there joined forces with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation — a company hired by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy — to conduct the road stops. And even though the drivers were told their provision of DNA was purely voluntary, many complained about the insistent quizzing and overall feeling of pressure — and that they were pulled to the side of the road in the first place for a research project, the Reading Eagle reported.<br />
<br />
“I feel this incident is a gross abuse of power on many levels,” said Reading resident Ricardo Nieves, in a complaint to the town’s City Council earlier this week, Fox News reported.<br />
<br />
Last month, the police chief of Fort Worth, Texas, actually issued an apology to drivers and residents, and promised to never participate in the federally driven study again. Fort Worth residents had complained about the high-pressure questioning, the intimidating presence of uniformed officers, and what they called a clear hit to their constitutional rights.<br />
<br />
Reading resident may not get the same apology, however,<br />
<br />
Reading Police Chief William Hein said to the Reading Eagle that federal authorities are only trying to determine the extent of drunken and drugged driving statistics as part of an overall fight to lower road crashes and driving-related injuries. And he said the cheek swab requests weren’t aimed at collecting DNA but rather checking for the presence of prescription drugs, Fox News said. Moreover, he claimed police only served as security and weren’t actually pulling drivers to the side or asking questions.<br />
<br />
“In the grand scheme of things, I think it’s a pretty innocuous and minor issue,” Mr. Heim said, in the Reading Eagle.<br />
<br />
The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania is watching the operation closely, claiming such checkpoints are only constitutional if they’re aimed at protecting the safety of the public, Fox News reported.

U.S. Sailors Sue Japan Over Fukushima<br />
<br />
<br />
By ELIZABETH WARMERDAM <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
 ShareThis   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
     SAN DIEGO (CN) - The Fukushima nuclear disaster exposed Navy rescue workers to dangerous levels of radiation, which the government-owned power plant covered up, eight U.S. sailors claim in court.<br />
     Eight crew members of the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan, whose home port is San Diego, sued the Tokyo Electric Power Co. in Federal Court.<br />
     They claim the utility company, &quot;a wholly owned public benefit subsidiary of the government of Japan,&quot; misrepresented radiation levels to lull the U.S. Navy &quot;into a false sense of security.&quot;<br />
     Lead plaintiff Lindsay R. Cooper claims Tokyo Electric (TEPCO) intentionally concealed the dangerous levels of radiation in the environment from U.S. Navy rescue crews working off the coast of Japan after the March 10, 2011 earthquake and tsunami set off the nuclear disaster.<br />
     &quot;TEPCO pursued a policy to cause rescuers, including the plaintiffs, to rush into an unsafe area which was too close to the FNPP [Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant] that had been damaged. Relying upon the misrepresentations regarding health and safety made by TEPCO ... the U.S. Navy was lulled into a false sense of security,&quot; the complaint states.<br />
     There were 5,500 sailors aboard the Reagan, the plaintiffs say, but this is not a class action. Six of the eight plaintiffs worked on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier; two worked in air contamination or the &quot;air department.&quot; One sued also on behalf of her infant daughter.<br />
     Japan called the relief effort Operation Tomadachi.<br />
     The complaint states: &quot;Defendant TEPCO and the government of Japan, conspired and acted in concert, among other things, to create an illusory impression that the extent of the radiation that had leaked from the site of the FNPP was at levels that would not pose a threat to the plaintiffs, in order to promote its interests and those of the government of Japan, knowing that the information it disseminated was defective, incomplete and untrue, while omitting to disclose the extraordinary risks posed to the plaintiffs who were carrying out their assigned duties aboard the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan.&quot;<br />
     It adds: &quot;Defendant represented and warranted that the levels of contamination to which the plaintiffs would be exposed were less than harmful to them and that their presence during 'Operation Tomadachi' would not cause any different or greater harm to them than they may have experienced on missions in the past. ...<br />
     &quot;At all times relevant times, the defendant, TEPCO, was aware that exposure to even a low dose of radiation creates a danger to one's health and that it is important to accurately report actual levels.<br />
     &quot;As a consequence of the earthquake and tsunami, the reactors were damaged and power to the cooling mechanism of the FNPP was interrupted, resulting in a meltdown of the fuel and reactor itself, thereby triggering the release of high levels of radiation.&quot;<br />
     And, they say: &quot;Defendants had actual and/or constructive knowledge of the properties of radiation that would ensure that, once released into the environment, radiation would spread further and in concentrations that would cause injury to the plaintiffs.&quot;<br />
     The plaintiffs claim the government deliberately misled them: &quot;the Japanese government kept representing that there was no danger of radiation contamination to the U.S.S. Reagan ... and/or its crew, that 'everything is under control,' 'all is OK, you can trust us,' and there is 'no immediate danger' or threat to human life, all the while lying through their teeth about the reactor meltdowns at FNPP.<br />
     &quot;Such reports were widely circulated with the defendant, TEPCO's, organization at the time it was published, despite the fact that the defendant knew that higher levels of radiation existed within the area whereat the plaintiffs and their vessel would be and were operating.&quot;<br />
     TEPCO controlled all activities at the power plant, so it is responsible for the plaintiffs' radiation exposure and subsequent damages, the sailors say.<br />
     &quot;According to then-existing data uniquely known to the defendant at the time, the plaintiffs' consequent exposure to radiation within their zone of operation, then indicated that radiation levels had already reached levels exceeding the levels of exposure to which those living the same distance from Chernobyl experienced who subsequently developed cancer,&quot; the complaint states.<br />
     &quot;Consequently, the potential for the development of cancer in the plaintiffs has also been enhanced due to the levels of exposure experienced by them during 'Operation Tomadachi.'&quot;<br />
     The sailors say they &quot;face additional and irreparable harm to their life expectancy, which has been shortened and cannot be restored to its prior condition.&quot;<br />
     The plaintiffs are Lindsay Cooper, James Sutton, Kim Gieseking and her daughter, Charles Yarris, Robert Miller, Christopher Bittner, Eric Membrila and Judy Goodwin.<br />
     They are seeking $10 million in compensatory damages and $30 million in punitive damages for fraud, negligence, strict liability, failure to warn, public and private nuisance, and defective design. They also want TEPCO ordered to establish a fund of $100 million to pay for their medical expenses.<br />
     They are represented by Paul Garner. <br />
