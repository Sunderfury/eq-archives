			People with poor circulation in their legs benefit from a home-based walking program and are more likely to keep it up over the long term, according to a new U.S. study.<br />
<br />
Researchers say the home-based program may be more effective at keeping people motivated than hospital-based exercise for a common and disabling problem, and may be a more cost-effective first-line treatment.<br />
<br />
“I was somewhat surprised that we achieved our results of a continued difference between the intervention and control groups because it is very difficult to get patients to adhere to an exercise program long term even when it is supervised, and our program was unsupervised, ” said Dr. Mary McDermott, who led the research.<br />
<br />
According to the National Institutes of Health, eight to 12 million people or one in every 20 Americans over the age of 50 has peripheral artery disease, or PAD, a condition caused by plaque build-up in arteries, especially in the legs. <br />
<br />
Having PAD significantly raises the chances of heart attack or stroke. <br />
<br />
McDermott, a physician and professor at Northwestern University in Chicago told Reuters Health, “Symptoms of peripheral artery disease are often not classic. A patient might just experience weakness in their legs or tiredness and both the doctor and the patient might think that it’s just a part of aging.”<br />
<br />
While African Americans are twice as likely as whites to develop the disease, other high risk groups include smokers, diabetics, people with hypertension or high cholesterol and anyone who has had a heart attack or stroke.<br />
<br />
There are few treatments for PAD – implanted stents to open the arteries or medication – and exercise. Past research has shown that treadmill walking can improve blood flow and help people with PAD to build up their endurance. But those studies focused on programs that required patients to go to a hospital or clinic to exercise, according to McDermott and her colleagues.<br />
<br />
They wanted to see if a home-based program might improve motivation to exercise by lessening the burden of traveling to a medical center three times a week for supervised workouts. <br />
<br />
The researchers recruited 194 participants with clogged arteries in their legs and randomly assigned them to two groups for the year-long experiment. One group took part in a structured home-based exercise program, and the comparison group did not exercise.<br />
<br />
Every participant took a six-minute test at the beginning of the study period and again at the end to measure how quickly they could pace back and forth along a 100-foot hallway. <br />
<br />
For six months, the home-based exercise group met once a week at an exercise center to receive instructions and guidance on exercise they’d do at home once a day. <br />
<br />
Those assigned to the comparison group also met weekly but at a medical center and instead of exercise instruction, they received health lectures.<br />
<br />
For the second six months of the study, members of the exercise group got a monthly telephone call from their group facilitator. They were encouraged to push themselves by walking five times a week, taking a quick rest when they experienced discomfort, slowly building their way up to a 50-minute walk.<br />
<br />
Members of the comparison group were contacted by a study coordinator who went over information related to the health topics in the lectures.<br />
<br />
At the end of the study, people in the exercise program walked faster and farther than those in the comparison group, whose members ended up performing worse than when they started, McDermott’s team reports in the Journal of the American Heart Association. <br />
<br />
The exercise group improved their six-minute walking distance by 87 feet, from 1166.0 ft. at the beginning of the study period to 1253 ft. at the end. Those in the comparison group, on average, walked a distance 25 ft less than they had a year earlier.<br />
<br />
McDermott thinks that even more than the monthly motivational phone calls, developing the habit of walking for a set amount of time every day probably had the strongest effect in the exercise group. She believes that continuing the on-site training for a bit longer or instituting ways for the participants to benefit from group support might have resulted in even greater improvement.<br />
<br />
“Some of the participants truly bonded with each other and became very engaged in the exercise,” McDermott said.<br />
<br />
Robert Patterson, a physician and clinical researcher at Brown University, told Reuters Health that exercise, which is considered a more conservative approach to managing peripheral artery disease, should be the first prescription PAD patients receive.<br />
<br />
“There are too many people getting what I consider unnecessary stenting or too much stenting,” Patterson said. “They come in, they complain, they get a stent that they will have for life.”<br />
<br />
If a patient tries exercise first and doesn’t see substantial results, they should then turn to the more aggressive approach of stenting, he said.<br />
<br />
“I ask my patients to set aside 40 minutes every day to walk. When they first start I tell them they might walk 15 minutes and rest 25 minutes. After six or 12 weeks, they might be walking for 25 minutes and resting for only 15, the effects (of walking) can be dramatic,” he said.<br />
<br />
If insurers were to get on board, Patterson adds, it would cost the whole healthcare system less money and possibly reduce the complications associated with people who get stents and must constantly have those stents replaced.<br />
<br />
“This study is important. This kind of paper gets at the issue of how we provide this kind of long lasting improved performance to patients in a cost effective fashion,” he said.

			European Elections 2014: German Party Dubbed 'Neo Nazis' Among Far Right Projected To Win Seats <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Huffington Post UK  |   Posted: 25/05/2014 22:00 BST  <br />
<br />
<br />
A German political party that has been compared to the Nazis by its critics is among the parties projected to have won seats in the European Parliament, in an election marked by a surge in right-wing parties that are either sceptical or hostile to the EU.<br />
<br />
The NPD has been campaigning on a platform of stopping immigration and been called racist and anti-semitic.<br />
<br />
They have campaigned under slogans like &quot;Money for granny instead of Sinti and Roma&quot; and &quot;the boat is full&quot;, given interviews insisting Europe is &quot;a continent of white people&quot; and, as pictured below, have marched with banners proclaiming the Nazi ideology of &quot;National Socialism&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
A recent reform to German electoral law - ending a ban on parties that fail to get 3% of the popular vote taking seats in the European Parliament - could pave the way for the NPD party to send an MEP to Brussels, having won around 1% of the vote.<br />
<br />
&quot;We say Europe is the continent of white people and it should remain that way,&quot; Udo Voigt, the party's lead candidate, told Reuters.<br />
<br />
&quot;We want to make sure that even in 50 years' time an Italian, a Frenchman, an Englishman, an Irishman and a German are still recognizable as European and cannot be mistaken for Ghanaians or Chinese.&quot;<br />
<br />
In France, Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration Front National defeated the Socialist Party with an extraordinary quarter of the vote.<br />
<br />
Outgoing Tory MEP Martin Callanan described the party as &quot;openly racist&quot; and described the result as &quot;black day for Europe&quot;.<br />
 <br />
An aide to French President Francois Hollande said the results were &quot;the start of the crisis&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tonight is the start of the crisis. The shock in Europe and the world will be very violent if the far-Right comes first in France,&quot; a senior aide to the president said, according to The Daily Telegraph.<br />
<br />
The Front National has never come first in a national election and, if its share of the vote is confirmed, it will have around 25 MEPs, out of the 74 representing France in Brussels.<br />
<br />
On hearing the projections, Le Pen called for the country's national parliament to be dissolved.<br />
<br />
&quot;What else can the president do after such a rejection?. It is unacceptable that the assembly should be so unrepresentative of the French people,&quot; she told reporters at her party headquarters.<br />
<br />
resultats europeennes 2014<br />
<br />
Front National leader Marine Le Pen called for the national assembly be dissolved on hearing the projected results<br />
<br />
<br />
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls described it as a &quot;political earthquake&quot;.<br />
<br />
A Danish exit poll suggested the right-wing People's Party had taken 23% of the vote, ahead of the ruling Social Democrats on 20%.<br />
<br />
In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party is expected to receive around a fifth of all votes cast, placing it third overall.<br />
<br />
In Greece, the extremist Golden Dawn party gained 9% of the vote and are expected to enter the EU Parliament for the first time.<br />
<br />
But the radical left-wing Syriza party, the most popular opposition party, came top in the country with 26% of the vote.<br />
<br />
Turnout was broadly low, as expected, but varied dramatically between countries - 90% in Belgium and just 13% in Slovakia.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nigel Farage's Ukip is poised to deliver the &quot;political earthquake&quot; he has promised in British politics as his party looked set to top the European polls.<br />
<br />
Labour have sources conceded that Ukip was likely to win the UK contest, with Eurosceptic parties across the continent expected to prosper as voters express their anger at the financial crisis which has crippled many countries in the 28-member bloc.<br />
<br />
David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have all faced criticism over the way they have responded to Ukip's rise and strategists will study the results of the final national ballot ahead of next year's general election as they plan how to tackle a new era of four-party politics.

			    Hi, Elliot Rodger here.<br />
<br />
    Well… this is my last video. It all has to come to this.<br />
<br />
    Tomorrow is the day of retribution. The day in which I will have my revenge against humanity. Against all of you.<br />
<br />
    For the last 8 years of my life, ever since I’ve hit puberty, I’ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desires. All because girls have never been attracted to me.<br />
<br />
    Girls gave their affection, and sex, and love, to other men but never to me.<br />
<br />
    I’m 22 years old and I’m still a virgin. I’ve never even kissed a girl.<br />
<br />
    I’ve been through college for two and a half years, more than that actually, and I’m still a virgin.<br />
<br />
    It has been very torturous.<br />
<br />
    College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex, and fun, and pleasure. But in those years I’ve had to rot in loneliness.<br />
<br />
    It’s not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me.<br />
<br />
    I don’t know why you girls aren’t attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it.<br />
<br />
    It’s an injustice, a crime, because I don’t know what you don’t see in me. I’m the perfect guy, and yet you throw yourselves at all these obnoxious men, instead of me, the supreme gentlemen.<br />
<br />
    I will punish all of you for it. (laughs)<br />
<br />
    On the day of retribution I am going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB… and I will slaughter every single spoiled, stuck-up, blonde slut I see inside there.<br />
<br />
    All those girls that I’ve desired so much, they would’ve all rejected me and looked down upon me as an inferior man if I ever made a sexual advance towards them while they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes.<br />
<br />
    I will take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you.<br />
<br />
    You will finally see that I am in truth the superior one. The true alpha male. (laughs)<br />
<br />
    Yes, after I’ve annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I’ll take to the streets of Isla Vista, and slay every single person I see there.<br />
<br />
    All those popular kids who live such lives of hedonistic pleasure while I’ve had to rot in loneliness for all these years, they’ve all looked down upon me every time I try to go out and join them. They’ve all treated me like a mouse.<br />
<br />
    Well now, I will be a God compared to you. You will all be animals. You are animals, and I will slaughter you like animals. I will be a God, exacting my retribution, on all those who deserve it.<br />
<br />
    And you do deserve it, just for the crime of living a better life than me.<br />
<br />
    All you popular kids. You’ve never accepted me, and now you’ll all pay for it.<br />
<br />
    And girls, all I’ve ever wanted was to love you, and to be loved by you. I’ve wanted a girlfriend, I’ve wanted sex, I’ve wanted love, affection, adoration, but you think I’m unworthy of it.<br />
<br />
    That’s a crime that can never be forgiven.<br />
<br />
    If I can’t have you, girls, I will destroy you. (laughs)<br />
<br />
    You denied me a happy life, and in turn, I will deny all of you life. (laughs) It’s only fair.<br />
<br />
    I hate all of you, humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species. If I had it in my power, I would stop at nothing, to reduce every single one of you to mountains of skulls and rivers of blood, and rightfully so.<br />
<br />
    You deserve to be annihilated. And I’ll give that to you.<br />
<br />
    You never showed me any mercy, and so I will show you none. (laughs)<br />
<br />
    You force me to suffer all my life, and now I’ll make you all suffer.<br />
<br />
    I’ve waited a long time for this.<br />
<br />
    I’ll give you exactly what you deserve.

			Zero Point Frontiers had recently acquired a 3-D printer, which the company&#8217;s engineers quickly set about using to devise and build a low-cost, kid-size prosthetic hand. The engineers uploaded the hand design into the printer via a memory card, which the jet printer then used as a blueprint to guide its spray, back and forth, layer by layer, depositing tiny particles of plastic gradually to produce the 3-D object.<br />
<br />
Made out of a biodegradable polymer, the hard contraption fits onto Kate&#8217;s forearm with Velcro straps and is powered by her wrist movements. When Kate bends her wrist, the wires that act as tendons tighten, curling the little plastic fingers and allowing her to grip and pick things up.

			STORY HIGHLIGHTS<br />
<ul><li style="">A federal judge says she has no choice in allowing forced feeding to resume</li><li style="">'The court simply cannot let (the detainee) die,' the judge writes</li><li style="">Mohammed Abu Wa'el Dhiab, 42, a Syrian, has been detained since 2002 arrest</li><li style="">Dhiab is 'swiftly deteriorating' because he refuse to eat or drink</li></ul><br />
<br />
(CNN) -- A federal judge has lifted a temporary ban on painful forced feedings of a Guantanamo Bay detainee, saying she had no choice and &quot;the court simply cannot let (him) die.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the court will advance a &quot;speedy exchange&quot; of information about terrorism detainee Mohammed Abu Wa'el Dhiab's request to stop what he describes as abusive forced feedings, U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler ruled late Thursday.<br />
<br />
Dhiab, 42, a Syrian, was arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and has been detained in the U.S. military's facility for terrorism suspects at Guantanamo for more than 10 years, according to the London-based human rights group Reprieve.<br />
<br />
Dhiab has stopped eating, and his case is example of the forced feedings at Guantanamo, which the U.S. government has been administering typically to detainees who go on hunger strikes. Dhiab was cleared for release by the Obama administration in 2009 and has never been charged, Reprieve's website said.<br />
<br />
Kessler said the court &quot;is now faced with an anguishing Hobson's choice: reissue another temporary restraining order despite the very real probability that Mr. Dhiab will die, because he has indicated a continuing desire to refuse to eat and/or drink liquids, or refuse to issue the TRO and allow the medical personnel on the scene to take the medical actions to keep Mr. Dhiab alive, but at the possible cost of great pain and suffering.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Court is in no position to make the complex medical decisions necessary to keep Mr. Dhiab alive,&quot; the judge said. &quot;Thanks to the intransigence of the Department of Defense, Mr. Dhiab may well suffer unnecessary pain from certain enteral feeding practices and forcible cell extractions. However, the Court simply cannot let Mr. Dhiab die.&quot;<br />
<br />
The judge noted that Mr. Dhiab's physical condition has been &quot;swiftly deteriorating, in large part because he was refusing food and/or water.&quot;

Other than that, I felt it was the best X-Men movie yet, even better than the second one.  It wasn't Wolverine and friends, which was nice for once.  Mystique was actually useful and it didn't feel like they just had Jennifer Lawrence there because she is overly popular right now.  Tyrion just seemed to be there, not really given much to do.  Blink was awesome.<br />

There is an end credits scene way at the end if you are curious, well worth waiting for.</div>

IG: Missing Swenson Medal of Honor file last seen on Petraeus' desk<br />
May. 14, 2014 - 06:00AM<br />
<br />
When Army Capt. William Swenson received the Medal of Honor last year — the first living officer to earn one since Vietnam — he received more than the traditional accolades.<br />
<br />
He also got an apology.<br />
<br />
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel offered the highly unusual mea culpa at the official Pentagon Hall of Hero’s induction ceremony Oct. 16. Speaking directly to Swenson, Hagel said: “We’re sorry you and your family had to endure through that.”<br />
<br />
That was a reference to Swenson’s botched nomination packet, which got lost within U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan amid a whirlwind of politics, controversy and scandalous intrigue.<br />
<br />
The details of how Swenson’s packet got lost were detailed for the first time in a Defense Department Inspector General report released to Military Times under the Freedom of Information Act.<br />
<br />
The original packet was last seen after it left now-retired Army Gen. David Petraeus’ desk, when the powerful four-star commander recommended that the honor be downgraded to a Distinguished Service Cross, according the IG.<br />
<br />
Controversy over air strikes<br />
Why Petraeus made that recommendation is unclear; he told IG investigators that he had no recollection of Swenson’s nomination package. However, the IG concluded that other evidence “outweighed Gen. Petraeus’ testimony” and that he had, in fact, endorsed the packet with a downgrade.<br />
<br />
In a telephone interview Thursday, Petraeus told Military Times that his hazy memory is not surprising in light of his overwhelming job as commanding general in Afghanistan. He noted that the Medal of Honor packet came to his desk just several weeks after he took command in Kabul, when the war effort was in a critical phase.<br />
<br />
“I just don’t have any recollection of it,” Petraeus said. “I had tons of things going on. You have stuff coming across your desk all day, every day. I know when everyone isolates their attention on this and they can say ‘How could you not remember that?’ Well, we had some pretty big, big fish in the fryer in those days.”<br />
<br />
While Petraeus’ memory may have been fuzzy, he acknowledged to the IG that he knew about Swenson and the controversy the young captain helped fuel.<br />
<br />
Swenson criticized Army commanders for denying a request for airstrikes Sept. 8, 2009, when his unit was ambushed and Swenson repeatedly ran in and out of a kill zone to retrieve fellow soldiers, both wounded and dead.<br />
<br />
Petraeus told IG investigators that Swenson’s criticisms reflected a broader problem of how approval for close-air support for ground-level troops under fire “had become overly bureaucratic.”<br />
<br />
Concerns about Afghan civilian casualties were weighed against supporting troops in danger, which Petraeus described as a “very, very tough issue,” according to the IG.<br />
<br />
Swenson’s MOH packet hit Petraeus’ desk July 27, 2010, according to the IG, a time when the U.S. headquarters in Kabul was focused on the controversy surrounding the use of airstrikes.<br />
<br />
About one week later, on Aug. 4, Petraeus announced a new “tactical directive” regarding airstrikes. Ground troops welcomed the change and perceived the new directive as a shift away from the unpopular rules of engagement that had prioritized protecting civilians at the expense of troops’ safety.<br />
<br />
About that same time, Swenson’s nomination package got lost for more than a year because after the packet left Petraeus’ desk, his headquarters staff failed to forward it to U.S. Central Command and Army Human Resources Command, according to the IG.<br />
<br />
'Powerful enemies'<br />
Swenson told the IG that he made some “powerful enemies” in the Army after he criticized the higher-ups for denying his request for fire support during Afghanistan’s Battle of Ganjgal, for which he was ultimately honored with the nation’s highest valor medal. He said he believed his initial Medal of Honor nomination was deliberately derailed in retaliation for his criticisms.<br />
<br />
About one year after the packet was last seen on Petraeus’ desk, Army officials began asking questions about the status of the nomination and initially could not find any record of the packet in the service’s computer systems.<br />
<br />
In July 2011, Army officials in Afghanistan’s Regional Command East “found the packet on the portal” and refiled the nomination for an MOH, according to the IG report.<br />
<br />
But Swenson declared that the Army’s investigation into the matter was flawed and said he would not accept any award until his concerns about senior official misconduct were resolved.<br />
<br />
In November 2011, he sent a letter to Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., saying he would accept no award “unless an effort was made to restore the integrity of the Medal [of Honor] and hold those accountable who attempted to bring shame upon it,” according to the IG report.<br />
<br />
Concerns on Capitol Hill helped spark the DoD IG investigation, which was finalized last October but withheld for nearly six months following the FOIA request from Military Times.<br />
<br />
The IG’s investigation essentially contradicts the Kabul headquarters’ own internal probe by concluding that Swenson’s package was last seen at Petraeus’ headquarters in Kabul, not the task force-level headquarters in eastern Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Even so, the IG found “there was no evidence that a senior official mishandled, lost, destroyed, purged, disposed of, or unnecessarily delayed the recommendation.”<br />
<br />
But critics on Capitol Hill still have questions about Petraeus’ role in the matter.<br />
<br />
“Petraeus’ statements seem to suggest that MoH nominations were flying off his desk, too many to count. But that’s nonsense,” said Joe Kasper, a spokesman for Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who served as a Marine in both Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Petraeus told Military Times unequivocally that there was no link between Swenson’s criticisms and the botched MOH packet.<br />
<br />
“I think folks have, you know, made a bit of a conspiracy out of this. They are developing a conspiracy theory that is just not warranted,” Petraeus said.<br />
<br />
In hindsight, the summer of 2010 was a critical time for the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan. Troop levels were rising and the U.S. military had renewed its commitment to the war effort that for years had been overshadowed by Iraq.<br />
<br />
Petraeus assumed command unexpectedly after his predecessor, now-retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal, was summarily fired in June 2010 after he was quoted in a magazine article criticizing and insulting civilian colleagues and White House officials.<br />
<br />
“I had some petty consuming jobs in those periods and [the Medal of Honor packet] was not a big area of focus for me, to put it mildly,” Petraeus said.<br />

			Rift between Medal of Honor recipients exposed<br />
<br />
Army Capt. Will Swenson and Marine Cpl. Dakota Meyer fought side-by-side in a vicious 2009 battle in Afghanistan, working together to recover the bodies of four U.S. service members who were slain on the battlefield and stripped of their weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
Both men have been recognized by the military for their heroism. As a sergeant, Meyer became in 2011 the first living Marine in 38 years to receive the Medal of Honor, recognized for braving enemy fire repeatedly to save service members trapped in a hail of gunfire. Swenson will receive the nation's top valor award Tuesday in a White House ceremony, following a long delay and Meyer lobbying publicly on the Army officer's behalf.<br />
<br />
But a rift between the two war heroes exists, according to a front-page Washington Post story published Sunday. Swenson &quot;remains skeptical of Meyer and the publicity he has sought,&quot; and &quot;engaged in a lengthy and bitter dispute with the military over the narrative of one of the Afghan war's most notorious firefights.&quot; The Army officer, who left active duty in 2011, pushed the service to produce a website outlining the battle, and told the Post it &quot;is not going to mutually support other stories&quot; — namely, Meyer's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you familiar with Pyrrhic victories?&quot; Swenson, 34, told the Post, using a term that originated in Greek history to describe a victory that is so costly, it is tantamount to a loss. &quot;That's what I specialize in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Three Marines and a Navy corpsman were killed in the battle, which began around dawn Sept. 8, 2009, when somewhere between 60 and 100 insurgents launched a vicious U-shaped ambush on a patrol that included U.S. Marines and soldiers and the Afghan army and police units they were training. Swenson's senior enlisted adviser on trip, Sgt 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook, sustained gunshot wounds and died about a month later.<br />
<br />
The ambush's effects were amplified by gaffes by officers in a nearby tactical operations center, a military investigation later found. They repeatedly denied troops on the ground fire support and timely air support and failed to convey the urgency of the situation to high levels of command, according to military documents obtained by Marine Corps Times. Two officers later received letters of reprimand, officials said.<br />
<br />
Seemingly at the heart of the disagreement between Meyer and Swenson is a 2011 narrative summary of the battle produced by the Marine Corps Division of Public Affairs. It credits Meyer, now 25, with saving 13 U.S. service members and 23 Afghan forces during the fierce firefight while making five trips into the Ganjgal Valley, in Kunar province, under heavy enemy fire. It was widely used by the media in coverage of Meyer's award.<br />
<br />
The accuracy of the narrative was first questioned in late 2011 in a McClatchy Newspapers investigative report. It was written by Jonathan Landay, a journalist who was embedded with U.S. forces that day and witnessed the first 90 minutes of a six-hour battle. Landay alleged that while Meyer deserved the Medal of Honor, aspects of the Corps' account of events were &quot;untrue, unsubstantiated or exaggerated.&quot; Among other details, his story pointed out that only 11 U.S. service members actually were in the valley that day, four of whom died. Others were posted farther away, but faced less danger and did not need to be rescued.<br />
<br />
The Corps' narrative summary of the battle was compiled by a small team of Marines, led by Col. Chris Hughes, who oversaw much of the Corps' public affairs effort to support Meyer in the weeks leading up to his September 2011 ceremony at the White House. Marine officials have acknowledged the summary wasn't vetted as carefully as Meyer's award citation, but nevertheless stood by the its accuracy.<br />
<br />
Killed in the battle were Gunnery Sgt. Edwin Johnson, 31; Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, 30; 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, 25; and Navy Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class James Layton, 22. All were members of Meyer's unit, Marine Embedded Training Team 2-8, out of Okinawa, Japan. About a dozen Afghan soldiers also were killed during the battle, and Westbrook died the following month at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington due to complications from a blood transfusion.<br />
<br />
Meyer responds<br />
Meyer declined to comment Sunday on many aspects of the Post's story, but pointed out he repeatedly lobbied for the captain to receive the Medal of Honor. He published a book, &quot;Into the Fire: A Firsthand Account of the Most Extraordinary Battle in the Afghan War,&quot; with author Bing West last year that outlined the battle and again questioned why Swenson had not received the award already.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has never been about me. I do not deserve the Medal of the Honor, and I've said that all along,&quot; Meyer said in a phone interview. Of Swenson, he added: &quot;I hope he finds peace, and if he ever needs anything he can call me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meyer's book says he sent a letter to the White House shortly after receiving the Medal of Honor urging officials there to take a longer look at Swenson's heroism. The captain, according to Meyer's letter, &quot;was the centerpiece for command and control in a raging firefight that never died down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Swenson controlled all the helos. He picked out targets and kept situational awareness, radioing cardinal directions and distances,&quot; Meyer's letter said. &quot;Not everyone can do that when bullets are continuously hitting the side of your truck. Swenson was not the senior commander; he just took over and everyone deferred to him. To the extent that anyone was in charge on the chaotic battlefield over the course of six or seven hours, it was Captain Will Swenson.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meyer's book points out that Combined Joint Task Force 82, commanded by then-Army Maj. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, was charged with handling Swenson's Medal of Honor packet while the investigations were ongoing in 2009. The packet &quot;had vanished into thin air, forgotten by everybody in the chain of command,&quot; the book said. It suggests Swenson symbolizes Ganjgal and the battle &quot;conveyed the wrong message: failure to support advisors, failure to provide artillery support, failure to deliver timely air support, et cetera.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marine Gen. John Allen, then the top commander in Afghanistan, took an interest in the case in summer 2011 and eventually endorsed Swenson's packet. The White House announced last month that Swenson would receive the Medal of Honor.<br />
<br />
Meyer's book credited Swenson as a &quot;great help and careful reader.&quot; However, he acknowledged in an interview last year that they rarely spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;The thing is, most of these people I didn't know before the battle,&quot; he told Marine Corps Times. &quot;So now after, it's like, the battle brings you close, but it's not like we knew each other before, you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Meyer told Marine Corps Times last year that he feels like has &quot;antagonists&quot; who have questioned his actions on the battlefield, and acknowledged Landay is an example.<br />
<br />
&quot;The way I look at it is him writing on me — good, bad, whatever he wants to write — that is a freedom that all the guys in Ganjgal died for that day. The sacrifices they paid,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;If he wants to use what those guys sacrificed so much for to write negative articles, and that's how he wants to use his freedom, do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Landay has stood by his reporting. He sat with Swenson this April at Fort Benning, Ga., as the Army posthumously awarded Westbrook the Silver Star, the nation's third highest award in recognizing combat valor. In the Post article, Landay called Swenson &quot;one of the most upstanding and moral men I have met in my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mixed feelings<br />
Swenson has kept a low profile since the battle. In fact, an Army official said last week that while he had previously agreed to do interviews ahead of his ceremony, he changed his mind. An interview scheduled Thursday with this reporter was canceled as a result.<br />
<br />
The Gold Star families of those lost in the battle had mixed feelings about the Post's story. Many of them were invited to attend Swenson's ceremony, something they were not allowed to do when Meyer received the Medal of Honor two years ago.<br />
<br />
Charlene Westbrook, who maintains a close relationship with Swenson, said she was glad to see Swenson air his feelings publicly.<br />
<br />
&quot;The truth is finally coming out,&quot; she told Marine Corps Times. &quot;There's no inflation or dramatization in what [Swenson] said.&quot;<br />
<br />
But two other Gold Star family members from the battle expressed sadness Sunday at perceived attacks on Meyer. Susan Price, Kenefick's mother, said she speaks to Meyer on the phone occasionally, and was frustrated to see the same questions raised about Meyer's heroism again. Regardless of the number of people he pulled from the kill zone, she said, it is undisputed he deserves the Medal of Honor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give this kid a break,&quot; she said. &quot;The little specifics don't matter to us, the people who lost our children that day. What Dakota did was a gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brent Layton, the fallen corpsman's father, said he is traveling to Washington to honor Swenson. He doesn't understand the criticism of Meyer, however.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm standing in for James,&quot; he said of his son. &quot;It's not a time to be bad-mouthing anyone.&quot;<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So I've managed to lose my Nexus 7 and was looking at getting another tablet to replace it.  Now, in all honestly my Nexus 7 experience wasn't that great.  I found it slow to turn on, slow to charge, battery hungry in standby and frequently locked up.  Having said that mine was one of the first production ones so I think I got a bit of a lemon as everyone else I know with one had much better experiences.<br />
Regardless, the longer I had it, the slower it went, randomly froze and increasingly just crashed apps.  So much so that I really feel no loss at it disappearing.<br />
<br />
This time around I'm looking at a 10 inch tablet though my budget tops out at about $500<br />
<br />
I'd been looking at the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-Edition-Black/dp/B00F3SOJ7O/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400823668&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=samsung+galaxy+note" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014)</a> - price here is $520 (in white which isn't my first choice)<br />
This tablet seems decent, speedy, bright and the stylus seems useful.  Added to that it has a 4G connection so I could conceivably use it outside of my home or office wifi.<br />
<br />
But today I had a play with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transformer-T100TA-C1-GR-Detachable-Touchscreen-Laptop/dp/B00FFJ0HUE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400822876&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=asus+t100" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Asus Transformerbook T100</a> and been quite impressed - best price here is $450.  The keyboard dock bit is pretty appealing and thanks to my gf's laptop I'm getting used to windows 8 these days.<br />
<br />
Has anyone used either of these and can give me some more impressions?<br />
<br />
<u>Activities I'd use them for</u><br />
Either would give me access to reading comics &amp; magazines - potentially the Samsung slightly better on the magazine side.  Ebooks I'm not concerned with - my kindle has that covered.  Both would let me stream movies from my Plex server.  Windows 8 would have working flash in browsers which would be nice.<br />
Both of them I could use HDMI out to send presentations to a projector.  The Asus has a slight advantage coming with Office Home &amp; Student 2013 bundled so I could pull up work docs without any formatting/formulas potentially changing.  Additionally it could run Articulate Storyline (for shorter e-learning modules anyway).<br />
Gaming - Actually one area where I'd sort of prefer an ipad (but thats at least $150 more) as I would play things like Ticket to Ride vs my gf on her ipad mini.  Android is ok for games but I never played anything overly memorable on the Nexus 7.  For mobile gaming I'd use my 3DS instead so I'm just looking for couch or in bed gaming.  The ASUS game ability is very attractive, I've seen youtube videos of it running Portal 2 and there's probably 100+ games in my steam library with less system requirements than Portal 2.  And this new Steam streaming thing might work too with the ASUS.<br />
Space - both accept micro SD cards and while the ASUS is 64gb, you only get 34 after windows install so thats essentially identical.<br />
Photos - I think I could actually get some decent photo sorting going with the Asus, I never found an easy way to do that with android. But the Asus screen resolution could be a limiting factor for doing any image editing.<br />
<br />
If I lived in the US the Asus can be had for about $350 which I'd grab with no hesitation.  But the cost jump here puts it in direct competition with the Samsung (actually at most stores the prices are identical at $599). I think the Asus is the better choice, but I can't help but think this is kinda like Zune vs Ipod or Nokia N95 vs Iphone.  Technically better, but regretting it if you do.  Or maybe they're both Zunes and I should save another 4 months for a higher capacity ipad.</div>

<br />
&quot;Calvin? Calvin, sweetheart?&quot;<br />
 In the darkness Calvin heard the sound of Susie, his wife of fifty-three years. Calvin struggled to open his eyes. God, he was so tired and it took so much strength. Slowly, light replaced the darkness, and soon vision followed. At the foot of his bed stood his wife. Calvin wet his dry lips and spoke hoarsely, &quot;Did... did you.... find him?&quot;<br />
 &quot;Yes dear,&quot; Susie said smiling sadly, &quot;He was in the attic.&quot;<br />
 Susie reached into her big purse and brought out a soft, old, orange tiger doll. Calvin could not help but laugh. It had been so long. Too long.<br />
 &quot;I washed him for you,&quot; Susie said, her voice cracking a little as she laid the stuffed tiger next to her husband.<br />
 &quot;Thank you, Susie.&quot; Calvin said.<br />
 A few moments passed as Calvin just laid on his hospital bed, his head turned to the side, staring at the old toy with nostalgia.<br />
 &quot;Dear,&quot; Calvin said finally. &quot;Would you mind leaving me alone with Hobbes for a while? I would like to catch up with him.&quot;<br />
 &quot;All right,&quot; Susie said. &quot;I'll get something to eat in the cafeteria. I'll be back soon.&quot;<br />
 Susie kissed her huband on the forehead and turned to leave. With sudden but gentle strength Calvin stopped her. Lovingly he pulled his wife in and gave her a passionate kiss on the lips. &quot;I love you,&quot; he said.<br />
 &quot;And I love you,&quot; said Susie.<br />
 Susie turned and left. Calvin saw tears streaming from her face as she went out the door.<br />
 Calvin then turned to face his oldest and dearest friend. &quot;Hello Hobbes. It's been a long time hasn't it old pal?&quot;<br />
 Hobbes was no longer a stuffed doll but the big furry old tiger Calvin had always remembered. &quot;It sure has, Calvin.&quot; said Hobbes.<br />
 &quot;You... haven't changed a bit.&quot; Calvin smiled.<br />
 &quot;You've changed a lot.&quot; Hobbes said sadly.<br />
 Calvin laughed, &quot;Really? I haven't noticed at all.&quot;<br />
 There was a long pause. The sound of a clock ticking away the seconds rang throughout the sterile hospital room.<br />
 &quot;So... you married Susie Derkins.&quot; Hobbes said, finally smiling. &quot;I knew you always like her.&quot;<br />
 &quot;Shut up!&quot; Calvin said, his smile bigger than ever.<br />
 &quot;Tell me everything I missed. I'd love to hear what you've been up to!&quot; Hobbes said, excited.<br />
 And so Calvin told him everything. He told him about how he and Susie fell in love in high school and had married after graduating from college, about his three kids and four grandkids, how he turned Spaceman Spiff into one of the most popular sci-fi novels of the decade, and so on. After he told Hobbes all this there was another pregnant pause.<br />
 &quot;You know... I visited you in the attic a bunch of times.&quot; Calvin said.<br />
 &quot;I know.&quot;<br />
 &quot;But I couldn't see you. All I saw was a stuffed animal.&quot; Calvin voice was breaking and tears of regret started welling up in his eyes.<br />
 &quot;You grew up old buddy.&quot; said Hobbes.<br />
 Calvin broke down and sobbed, hugging his best friend. &quot;I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry I broke my promise! I promised I wouldn't grow up and that we'd be together forever!!&quot;<br />
 Hobbes stroke the Calvin's hair, or what little was left of it. &quot;But you didn't.&quot;<br />
 &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
 &quot;We were always together... in our dreams.&quot;<br />
 &quot;We were?&quot;<br />
 &quot;We were.&quot;<br />
 &quot;Hobbes?&quot;<br />
 &quot;Yeah, old buddy?&quot;<br />
 &quot;I'm so glad I got to see you like this... one last time...&quot;<br />
 &quot;Me too, Calvin. Me too.&quot;<br />
 &quot;Sweetheart?&quot; Susie voice came from outside the door.<br />
 &quot;Yes dear?&quot; Calvin replied.<br />
 &quot;Can I come in?&quot; Susie asked.<br />
 &quot;Just a minute.&quot;<br />
 Calvin turned to face Hobbes one last time. &quot;Goodbye Hobbes. Thanks... for everything...&quot;<br />
 &quot;No, thank you Calvin.&quot; Hobbes said.<br />
 Calvin turned back to the door and said, &quot;You can come in now.&quot;<br />
 Susie came in and said, &quot;Look who's come to visit you.&quot;<br />
 Calvin's children and grandchildren followed Susie into Calvin's room. The youngest grandchild ran past the rest of them and hugged Calvin in a hard, excited hug. &quot;Grandpa!!&quot; screamed the child in delight.<br />
 &quot;Francis!&quot; cried Calvin's daughter, &quot;Be gentle with your grandfather.&quot;<br />
 Calvin's daughter turned to her dad. &quot;I'm sorry, Daddy. Francis never seems to behave these days. He just runs around making a mess and coming up with strange stories.&quot;<br />
 Calvin laughed and said, &quot;Well now! That sound just like me when I was his age.&quot;<br />
 Calvin and his family chatted some more until a nurse said, &quot;Sorry, but visiting hours are almost up.&quot;<br />
 Calvin's beloved family said good bye and promised to visit tommorrow. As they turned to leave Calvin said, &quot;Francis. Come here for a second.&quot;<br />
 Francis came over to his grandfather's side, &quot;What is it Gramps?&quot;<br />
 Calvin reached over to the stuffed tiger on his bedside and and held him out shakily to his grandson, who looked exactly as he did so many years ago. &quot;This is Hobbes. He was my best friend when I was your age. I want you to have him.&quot;<br />
 &quot;He's just a stuffed tiger.&quot; Francis said, eyebrows raised.<br />
 Calvin laughed, &quot;Well, let me tell you a secret.&quot;<br />
 Francis leaned closer to Clavin. Calvin whispered, &quot;If you catch him in a tiger trap using a tuna sandwich as bait he will turn into a real tiger.&quot;<br />
 Francis gasped in delighted awe. Calvin continued, &quot;Not only that he will be your best friend forever.&quot;<br />
 &quot;Wow! Thanks grandpa!&quot; Francis said, hugging his grandpa tightly again.<br />
 &quot;Francis! We need to go now!&quot; Calvin's daughter called.<br />
 &quot;Okay!&quot; Francis shouted back.<br />
 &quot;Take good care of him.&quot; Calvin said.<br />
 &quot;I will.&quot; Francis said before running off after the rest of the family.<br />
 Calvin laid on his back and stared at the ceiling. The time to go was close. He could feel it in his soul. Calvin tried to remember a quote he read in a book once. It said something about death being the next great adventure or something like that. He eyelids grew heavy and his breathing slowed. As he went deeper into his final sleep he heard Hobbes, as if he was right next to him at his bedside. &quot;I'll take care of him, Calvin...&quot;<br />
 Calvin took his first step toward one more adventure and breathed his last with a grin on his face

			Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder of childhood, yet experts are worried by statistics that show very young kids are now getting powerful medications to treat the problem.<br />
<br />
Some 10,000 toddlers across the U.S. are being diagnosed as hyperactive and receiving drugs such as Ritalin and Adderall, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has announced in a new report. The 2- and 3-year-olds — especially those whose families who are on Medicaid —are getting the drugs even though the American Academy of Pediatrics doesn’t even have guidelines for ADHD in children under 4.<br />
<br />
“We're giving Adderall to 2-year-olds? I mean, that's nuts,” said Dr. Lawrence H. Diller, a behavioral pediatrician.<br />
<br />
“There's no evidence that it works. There's no evidence that it's safe. These are desperate measures.”<br />
<br />
Doctors say drugs that treat ADHD can stunt growth or cause insomnia and loss of appetite even in older children. Diller also noted that while the U.S. makes up 4 percent of the world's population, it uses 70 percent of the world's Adderall and Ritalin.<br />
<br />
About 11 percent of American children 4-17 years of age have been diagnosed with ADHD, according to the CDC. Kids with the disorder have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors, or are overly active, which can cause trouble at school or at home.<br />
<br />
Some doctors say ADHD medications could be a last resort physicians turn to when toddlers might harm themselves, but others note having lots of energy and acting out is simply a part of being a young child.<br />
<br />
Many parents are disturbed by the CDC’s findings.<br />
<br />
“I don't get how you diagnose somebody. I mean, if they're hyper or all over the place then you probably have a 2-year-old,” said Craig Lewis, a dad.<br />
<br />
Doctors say more studies are needed on the effects of ADHD drugs on children so young. The CDC’s findings follow a recent survey that found 7.5 percent of U.S. children aged 6–17 are taking some sort of prescription medicine for emotional or behavioral difficulties.
