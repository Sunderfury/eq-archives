			Private company hired to check out welfare claimants attacked by MPs for 'degrading and crass' attitude <br />
<br />
LAST UPDATED AT 11:52 ON Fri 18 Jan 2013<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ATOS, the French-owned private company employed by the government to expose benefit fraudsters, faces renewed criticism for its &quot;degrading and crass&quot; attitude towards welfare claimants. It follows the revelation by a Labour MP said Atos asked a constituent with Crohn's disease to &quot;wear a nappy for work&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Iain Wright, the member for Hartlepool, made the allegation during yesterday's parliamentary debate about Atos, which is contracted by the Department for Work and Pensions to assess if those receiving incapacity benefits are fit for work.<br />
 <br />
Wright complained his constituent 'Mrs M' was one of several treated like &quot;dirt&quot; by the company when she was told to wear the nappy.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Her assessment and appeal were degrading, insensitive and unprofessional,&quot; said Wright. &quot;She was described throughout her appeal notes as a man. Incorrect dates and fictitious telephone calls were placed on her files&#8212;in other words, lies.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The Independent reports that fellow Labour MP and former minister Michael Meacher, who opened the debate, said 1,300 people had died after being placed by Atos in a category of people expected to begin preparing for employment &#8211; the so-called &quot;work related activity group&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Conservative MP and former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan raised concerns about how claimants with autism were treated while Robert Halfon, the Tory MP for Harlow, said Atos had &quot;not covered itself in glory&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Writing on Twitter following the debate, Meacher said he had &quot;never seen such unanimity&quot; among MPs that Atos had failed. He promised not to let the issue go after what The Guardian described as an &quot;emotional&quot; discussion.<br />
 <br />
Responding to criticism, Atos has said that during the &quot;difficult process&quot; of discovering whether benefit claimants are fit for work their employees follow &quot;strict guidelines&quot; and they &quot;continually ask for feedback<br />

			I beg to move that this House has considered the matter of Atos work capability assessments.<br />
 <br />
I warmly thank the Backbench Business Committee for enabling me and cross-party colleagues to introduce this debate on Atos work capability assessments. There is enormous concern about the issue both in the country and in this House, as witnessed by the fact that more than 30 Members wish to speak on a Thursday. To try to ensure that they can all do so, I propose to speak for no more than 10 to 15 minutes. I hope that colleagues will accept that, for reasons of pressure on time, I do not propose to take interventions.<br />
 <br />
As knowledge of the debate has spread, I have been sent nearly 300 case histories, many of which make heart-rending reading. I cannot begin to do justice to their feelings of distress, indignation, fear, helplessness and, indeed, widespread anger at the way they have been treated. Nor can I easily contain my own feelings at the slowness, rigidity and insensitivity with which Atos and the Department for Work and Pensions have responded&#8212;or very often not responded&#8212;to the cries of pain that they have heard repeatedly. I have time to cite briefly only three examples which show how extreme is the dysfunction and malfunctioning of the Atos assessments.<br />
 <br />
The first example concerns a constituent of mine who was epileptic almost from birth and was subject to grand mal seizures. At the age of 24, he was called in by Atos, classified as fit for work and had his benefit cut by £70 a week. He appealed, but became agitated and depressed and lost weight, fearing that he could not pay his rent or buy food. Three months later, he had a major seizure that killed him. A month after he died, the DWP rang his parents to say that it had made a mistake and his benefit was being restored.<br />
 <br />
The second example, also from the Oldham area, concerns a middle-aged woman who was registered blind and in an advanced stage of retinitis pigmentosa. She was assessed at 9 points&#8212;well short of the 15 that are needed&#8212;and her incapacity benefit was withdrawn. On review by a tribunal, the Atos rating of 9 points was increased to 24.<br />
 <br />
The third case&#8212;I could have chosen from hundreds of others&#8212;also comes from the north-west and concerns an insulin-dependent diabetic with squamous cell cancer, Hughes syndrome, which involves a failed immune system, peripheral neuropathy, which meant that he had no feeling in his feet or legs, heart disease, depression and anxiety. Despite his life-threatening condition, he was placed in the work-related activity group.<br />
 <br />
Those and myriad other examples illustrate incontrovertibly that Atos&#8217;s current work capability assessment system is drastically flawed, and for several reasons.<br />
 <br />
First, Atos is an IT firm and it uses the so-called Logic Integrated Medical Assessment, which is often described as &#8220;rigid&#8221; and &#8220;tick-box&#8221; because computer-based systems make it difficult for health professionals to exercise their professional judgment. Because such a mechanistic system has little or no regard for the complexity of the needs of severely disabled or sick persons, the British Medical Association and others have condemned the current WCA as &#8220;not fit for purpose&#8221;.<br />
 <br />
Secondly, assessed persons regularly felt that the opinion of their own doctor or of other specialist medical personnel who were treating them was either ignored or overridden. That is all the more serious when Atos&#8217;s practices simply do not adhere to the guidance for doctors set down by the General Medical Council.<br />
 <br />
Thirdly, because of the failure of so many initial assessments, the appeal procedure is grossly overloaded and hugely expensive. No less than 41% of decisions are appealed, of which 38% are won. At £60 million in a single year, the appeals have cost the taxpayer more than half of the £110 million that was spent on the original assessments. Moreover, the National Audit Office has castigated the Department for failing to penalise Atos for what it politely calls its &#8220;underperformance&#8221; and for not setting &#8220;sufficiently challenging&#8221; targets.<br />
 <br />
Fourthly, there are concerns about the responsibility for work capability assessments, in particular that of the Atos chief medical officer. Professor Michael O&#8217;Donnell joined Atos from the American company, Unum, formerly UnumProvident, which had a very poor reputation in the US, where it was described as an &#8220;outlaw company&#8221; by the US authorities, partly because it was regarded as a &#8220;disability denial factory&#8221;. In that situation, the responsibilities of the Minister and the Secretary of State need to be established clearly.<br />
 <br />
Against that background, it is frankly not good enough for the Minister to respond to the debate by saying that there have been three Harrington reviews, and that the Department is doing the best it can to improve procedures. The fundamental issue is this: how can pursuing with such insensitive rigour 1.6 million claimants on incapacity benefit, at a rate of 11,000 assessments every week, be justified when it has led, according to the Government&#8217;s own figures, to 1,300 persons dying after being put into the work-related activity group, 2,200 people dying before their assessment is complete, and 7,100 people dying after being put into the support group? Is it reasonable to pressurise seriously disabled persons into work so ruthlessly when there are 2.5 million unemployed, and when on average eight persons chase every vacancy, unless they are provided with the active and extensive support they obviously need to get and hold down work, which is certainly not the case currently?<br />
 <br />
I therefore want to conclude by asking the Minister five specific questions to which I want a specific answer before the end of the debate.<br />
 <br />
First, it is true that Harrington has produced minor adjustments&#8212;implemented at a glacial place&#8212;but the underlying system remains largely undisturbed. The BMA and the NAO have therefore called for a thorough, rigorous and transparently independent assessment of the suitability of the work capability assessment. Will the Minister now implement that?<br />
 <br />
Secondly, will the Minister accept that the current criteria and descriptors do not sufficiently&#8212;or even at all&#8212;take into account fluctuating conditions, especially episodic mental health problems? How will he rectify that?<br />
 <br />
Thirdly, will the Minister provide full and transparent details of the Atos contract? They should not be hidden by specious claims of commercial confidentiality when Atos is the sole provider of what is clearly a public service. Better still, given that Atos has failed so dramatically, why does he not in-source the work back into the NHS?<br />
 <br />
Fourthly, how will the Minister ensure that the medical expertise of disabled persons&#8217; doctors and related professionals is fully taken into account before assessments are completed?<br />
 <br />
Lastly, I want to provide a full dossier to the Secretary of State so that he fully understands what is being done today in his name, and to bring a small delegation to see him from some of the excellent organisations of disabled people who have heroically battled to highlight and tackle the distress and pain caused by Atos. Can I please be assured that the Secretary of State will see such a delegation?<br />
 <br />
I repeat that I am sincerely grateful for this debate, for the co-operation of colleagues from all parties, and for the detailed responses I have received from so many hundreds of victims of Atos, but I assure the Minister of this: the debate is important, but it will certainly not be the end of the matter.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Title says it all.  So, I was checking out the prices for standing desks in the interest of not murdering my resting metabolic rate and having additional negative health issues.  They are somewhat expensive, especially as you go to the mechanized/bigger ones.  Anyways, I saw this article about someone making their own version of a standing desk using parts from IKEA and some elbow grease.  Being a person who can operate a drill and basic tools this was relevant to my interests.  It turns out that the total cost of this is super cheap compared to other full sized desk options.  Where the issue comes out is that no one ever mentioned how cheap as hell IKEA is. Why aren't you pimping out IKEA Swedes? I mean goddamn, the US whores out all our businesses and culture like pussy is a war ration, take a note from us on that front.<br />
<br />
The materials are pretty nice looking as well, with either a dark or light finish available.  It looks like the total cost of the items will be about 200 bucks and an hours time or so.  The upside is you gain 100% of your standing MBR instead of only 40%, thus requiring less exercise and you do not hurt your health via additional cholesterol issues.  Also, you could add in a treadmill for some ambitious gaming/tv watching without becoming a couch potato.  Think how brilliant you will seem while you pass everyone up in the local marathon despite playing video games ten hours a day thanks to your cardio from running on the treadmill while calling people's mother's whores on XBOX live and touting your recent sexual conquests with said allegedly whore like mother.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Are any of you using these?  They appeal to me greatly, primarily due to being able to realize all the cognitive benefits of nicotine without the health risks and quality of life reduction of cigarettes.  And you can get electronic cigarettes in a variety of colors etc.  meaning that with a nice hot pink or race car red form you can indicate to others that it isn't a real cigarette and thus to get their panties out of a twist.<br />
<br />
Also, because it just is a water mist being expelled into the environment you can smoke them everywhere, harkening back to the devil may cry je ne sais quoi that made 'merica great, before it became a nanny state more interested in thwarting some myopic object that temporarily holds their interest while Rome burns to the tune of Nero's flute.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Lighting&quot; up in a fashion that was once common (as emulated on Mad Men) would be delectable.  And the materials are superbly inexpensive, unlike real cigarettes which are more taxed than the middle class thanks to the success of emotional appeals and the country's relentless love affair with sin taxes.</div>

<br />
I am going for increased jump so that I can dunk like Lebron James again or someone from NBA Jams.  I think echo location is sweet so I could boost that skill, then I would add the ability to see in infrared, and feel magnetic fields in a precise manner.  I also want the ability to see an overlay of the world with useful info through a HUD (we can already do this to an extent, but I want something awesome).  I would also add additional arms so that I could control more devices simultaneously.  <br />
<br />
I could be rocking rocket launchers in two hands and then doing work or bringing up data with my other two being a John Rambo Übermensch that can do mechanically intensive tasks while simultaneously doing mental work.  I want a neural interface to computers too and the ability to store ever thing I have ever seen and transform that with my mind into a new novel realization instead of having to do so with limited memory, basically utilize our resources well instead of having so much redundant matter in the event of trauma.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also want some wolverine claws and an adamantium skeleton as that is super sweet.  I also wish that I could curl up with a tough exterior armor like an armadillo or turtle,  providing an excellent barrier in the event of overwhelming odds.  I would also like to be able to do complex calculations in real time such that it is effectively the same as recalling from memory</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I had quite the health scare as far as my career longevity goes a few months back.  After years of spending long sessions working or gaming at a time on my computer, and not utilizing best practices for typing etc.  such behavior caught up with me.  The foolish invincibility of youth was shattered.  My hands developed RSI, and typing for any length of time was severely painful such that I was forced to not type at all essentially.  Luckily this was during summer break.  Even writing was painful for any length of time. <br />
<br />
 I thought I was going to have to start using a Dragon Naturally Speaking app just to communicate electronically, and how well could that really work for programming even? I doubt DNS would approach the efficacy of my input to any degree at all, or be able to capture the esoteric spelling and conventions well.  Basically, if the situation persisted I was hosed, so I had to do something about it as even having surgery would not bring my hands back to life fully.<br />
<br />
I was incredibly fortunate though that my hands did recover and I was able to resume typing and writing for short stints, taking a break after 20 minutes or so and making sure to hold my hands and arms at suggested positions so that I aided my own interests.  Utilizing Aspercreme initially majorly went a long way to reducing the soreness experienced.  Those two things made a huge difference.  Since then, I've purchased an ergonomic keyboard so that on epic death marches I don't wind up bleeding out in a ditch as my hands die in the night.  <br />
<br />
Xahlee did a lot of reviews for various keyboard designs and layouts that are worth reading. The ones he likes various in price, on the low end are the Microsoft ergonomic line of keyboards.  These are probably his third favorite keyboards, and Microsoft did a solid job designing and also making them cheap.  There are others he likes.  Two of them he likes are the kinesis countoured keyboard (what I use): <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboard_Kinesis.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboard_Kinesis.htm</a> and the uTRON keyboard: <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/uTRON_keyboard.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://xahlee.info/kbd/uTRON_keyboard.html</a> <br />
<br />
I like the uTRON one the best but it is also very expensive for a keyboard.  I think it is the best though if you need to take a keyboard with you when traveling as it is split in half, making it much more compact than either the MS one or the Kinesis option.  The Kinesis uses mechanical keys though if you like that sort of thing.  It's kind of noisy though, so the Kinesis linear may be more your style.<br />
<br />
In any event, even if you think getting RSI is unlikely, why take the chance when preventing it is free (using good hand form) or up to a &lt; 500 dollar investment that will last for years.  For most of us losing usage of our hands would effectively make us out of work in short order, so the downside of risking this is severe, and I can assure you even the onset of it is agonizing.  Your hands will throb for hours even if you aren't using them, even using the xbox controller will be painful, and if it worsens you'll have to get expensive surgery which won't even result in a full recovery.<br />
<br />
Laptop keyboards are unfortunately the worst when it comes to ergonomics, and it's not super convenient to tote around a big keyboard, but at least good hand form and reasonable breaks are implementable in such situations, which is most of the battle, training ourselves to help ourselves help our future selves, as the tendency is to do whatever is convenient and habit.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This isn't a rant, but I posted this in here due to the NSFW topic.  So, like most people with a dick, even when I'm in a relationship I like porn.  It's a great stress relief and it's not as though there is a ration on ejaculate.  In the past I was using some streaming sites, or when I wanted some 1080p content I would download it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, so in the interest of science I checked out the pricing of one of the streaming sites that has a bunch of the different networks bundled together for one price.  And, holy shit these prices are cheap.  For 1080p streams and the ability to download the scene in multiple formats at a high bitrate it was only 8 bucks a month.  <br />
<br />
It is by far the best 100 dollars I've spent (it was 8 dollars for 12 months of service), and I had no idea how inexpensive it was all this time.  I thought was like 20+ dollars for just one person's site, and here I can get 37 for 8 bucks.  The amount of videos is in the 6000+ range and it is well organized, which brings me to another point.<br />
<br />
Why are torrent and adult sites, the illegal/sinful sites, inevitably always much better designed than the legit, uber well funded megacorps?  The former sites always have a clean aesthetic, exceptional layout, excellent categories, and great search and other features, as well as some sort of comment/social feature.  It seems if anything it should be the other way around, but nope.  <br />
<br />
The megacorps sites are nearly always very cluttered and finding the actual content you want is nontrivial, they are basically the Wal-Mart grocery aisle layouts for the Internet.  The are designed to take as long as possible to get to where you want to go to so that you see more of their content I am guessing.<br />
<br />
One especially egregious example of this is how much of a clusterfuck the iTunes store is. Sure, it's pretty, but using their advanced searches is a total pain in the dick, and just navigating the site is really slow and inefficient.  Another example is Yahoo's site.  There is 100 different content categories and distracting as hell.  I think it was designed by artists on LSD while coding it up as that is about the only way someone would consider the facial imagery explosion delivered in category vomit format is reasonable.<br />
<br />
Google's websites are for the most part an exception to this trend.  Google+ however has gotten worse and worse over time in its layout, with much of the content being very poorly sized, making original content hard to view compared to a better layout that is more like their minimalistic designs of their email and search features.<br />
<br />
Another example is 4Chan's website (don't go here, it is awful, but if you had the unfortunate experience of going there the layout should be fresh).  Even though their was a ton of image content it was always the focus of the page, not something in a jungle of ads and other crap.<br />
<br />
The Verge is another capitalistic site that has a good layout.  It is very modern while still presenting the information that is important to the user with minimal unrelated content.  Also, I think Amazon and New Egg have good site designs, both of which have a ton of different kinds of information to display.  <br />
<br />
And that is what grinds my gears.</div>

<br />
Somehow the composers managed to come up with music that's not completely annoying, works well ambiently, and is a delight for the eyes.<br />
<br />
I thought people here might appreciate it, although be warned - if you play it for your kids who are just walking and making specific sub-verbal requests, you'll probably spend the next year watching it on repeat. :D</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I recently started back running again after growing tired of my previous cardio routine (elliptical).  I have some running shoes already, but in the interest of not damaging my feet after continual long runs I thought I would try the toe shoes.  I was doubtful at first, and they look strange to be sure, but the reviews were so fantastic from runners and the health effects of running in general is a much worse outcome that I thought to try them.<br />
<br />
The ones I purchased were these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vibram-FiveFingers-Grey-Palm-Shoes/dp/B001JYDEYU/ref=sr_1_1?s=shoes&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358618941&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Vibram+Fivefingers+Kso+Mens+Running+Shoes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Vibram-FiveFin...+Running+Shoes</a><br />
<br />
I've been wearing them for a few weeks now, and so far they have been great.  Your stride changes a bit but will become habit after a week or so, but these shoes really show off how impressively well engineered humans are for the most part.  Unlike popular opinion until recent research, our feet are actually incredibly well designed, able to dynamically adjust to different terrain to optimally apply the stress endured while running, which is a tremendous strain on our knees and feet and ankles unless you go barefoot.  <br />
<br />
I highly recommend these for those of you who do run or want to start running to avoid injury that would take you out of exercising for a while and hurt the performance gains you've made.  With these I can go for morning runs for miles everyday and not worry about being side lined after a few months.  I just wear some thin socks with them, but some people wear them barefoot.  I like to wear at least some socks though as shoes tend to get smelly otherwise, and rubber is not very kind to removing odor.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've made this quiche recipe a few times now and it has turned out really great.  It's pretty easy to make too.  One thing I should mention is that you must not use frozen vegetables in the recipe.  I did that the first time and the extra water that comes from the ice on the vegetables is disastrous for the result.  Chopping them by hand though and then using that instead resulted in a fantastic dish.<br />
