Always use the best items you can equip and always verify the damage you need to tank as well as deal.  The lower your tanking skills the less of an option you'll have with that last medium slot.<br />
<br />
It's far better at this stage in the game to work your shield skills if you generally have low skills.<br />
<br />
For level 3s, always target the frigates last.<br />
<br />
After warp in, wait to see if anything targets you before moving.  When nothing targets you, move to a better position before engaging.  When targeted, you need to remain still and destroy all of those ships until you can move without being aggro'd.  On some stages, you won't move until its time to loot cans.<br />
<br />
As a general rule, don't deploy drones until the last wave.  Remember to wait until the hostiles have targeted you or they will destroy your drones first.<br />
<br />
This is only a guide so take it as such.</div></div><hr />

I'll have to load the Ferox up again and take a shot at some more level 3's with it.  (Until I have enough ISK saved up again to actually equip the Raven.)<br />
<br />
I presume you wouldn't recommend swapping a tractor beam in for an NOS?  I hate loot can mop-up.  ;)<br />
<br />
I know one thing I did wrong was I didn't have the right damage specific hardeners on, but I wasn't sure that'd make enough of a difference to get me through the mission I was getting hammered in.</div></div><hr />

I'd do the math, but that requires effort, and since I haven't been exercising my brain lately it would probably be wrong.</div></div><hr />
