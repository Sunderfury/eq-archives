		<blockquote class="restore">When I first saw this game, it reminded me of playing games in Windows 3.1. I watched the TotalBiscuit thing and decided it didn't look so bad afterall. Knowing that I would not have time to play Guild Wars 2 because of work, I went ahead and picked this up. Very addicting, I was up way too late playing it.<br />
<br />
I thought I was tough stuff on my first run and of course hubris came knocking. I then suffered disaster after disaster four times in a row, before getting my best run all the way to a not so glorious death at the end. Eventually I wasn't able to destroy my adversaries and had to keep jumping out at the last second. Appropriately enough during this sequence the game started a music track that reminded me of Battlestar Gallactica.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of nice variation, although I still hope they make another with more refined features. I also want Evil Genius level/style graphics, but that's a pipe dream. :p<br />

			<div class="message">Looking at the achievements, it might actually be very difficult to achieve 6 different races as crew members. I have only seen human, rock, mantis, engi, z something. Never gotten them in the same playthrough though. Not sure what the 6th race is.</div>

</div>On my very best playthrough I had a human, rock, and engi, but also had found mysterious stasis pods during an event. Unfortunately I got to the end before I found an event that opens them. I wouldn't be surprised if that gave the last race.<br />
<br />
I got creamed on that run by the way, never even saw the boss. I'm wondering if spending scrap on hull repairs instead of upgrade just delays the inevitable.<br />
<br />
The game has a way of screwing you over without warning, but also coming to the rescue without warning. I had a run where I was constantly out of fuel, sure I would eventually just be stranded, and on the very last jump I found a huge cache of fuel. Of course, a jump later I got destroyed by a battlecruiser that shoots solar flares, but whatever! <br />

			<div class="message">My favorite story so far - all of my systems were destroyed by bombs, except for my door control and sick bay. I stuff my crew into those two, opened *all* hatches, and let asphyxiation prepare to repel all of the boarders. Mission accomplished. I find it amusing that sick bay can keep up with lack of oxygen, and you can rotate your guys through :)</div>

</div>The only ship I've unlocked is the engi drone ship. On one of my attempts with it, a fire or something killed my human, so all I was left with was two engis to manage the ship. At one point I get boarded by a bunch of mantis things just running amok in my ship. I managed to survive by fighting in the med bay. Med bay + engi ship regen bonus = unkillable muahahaha! Oh god a fire, noooooo.<br />

</div>The stasis pod is for a &quot;special&quot; race.<br />
<br />
The Normal races are:  Human, Engi, Rock, Mantis, Zoltan, Slug.<br />
<br />
Engi's repair really fast, suck at fighting.<br />
Rock immune to fire, Extra 50hp, 2nd best fighters.<br />
Mantis - Fast, Best fighters.<br />
Zoltan - lowered HP.  Provides 1 extra energy bar.<br />
Slug - Decent fighters, have &quot;telepathy&quot; can see enemy locations even without sensor upgrade or when sensor offline due to nebula or powered off.</blockquote>

Don't know what to tell you there, may be a bug of some type with your install - but yes, they're fire immune.  <br />
<br />
That was how I used boarding tactics when I played through with the Bulwark (rockman ship) - if they had a medbay, firebomb it then Beam in my boarding team of rockmen right into the fire.  (if no medbay firebomb some 2 slot room, then beam my guys in there.)  The opposing crew can't put out the fire while you're fighting in the room, so the fire disables the system - Your guys pound on theirs as the fire does extra damage (unless of course they have rockmen too).<br />

</div>It's happened on two computers - my laptop, which is my primary playspace for this game (offline steam while at work, yay) and my home desktop (which is my primary playspace for everything else).<br />
<br />
Next time I run through I'll try to pay better attention to what's going on if it happens again.</blockquote>

The best thing about the unlockable variants seems to be that they come with additional systems pre-installed. <br />

Sort of makes me think I'm supposed to unlock stuff on easy first, but I refuse! Almost beat it yesterday. Unlocked the Kestral's variant in the process.</blockquote>
