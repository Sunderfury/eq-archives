			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As I predicted, the endgame of GW2 is incomplete.  All of the dungeons are still very rough in terms of testing and balancing.  The encounters can be broken, unfair of sometimes way too easy with no boss mechanics to speak of.  The rewards are lackluster, irrelevant and frankly still broken (a lot of reports that the token numbers are not the same from person to person).  Orr, the one level 80 zone, is packed full of fast respawning mobs.  It can be a nice challenge to move about but there is not a real incentive to do so.  The final dungeon, Arah, suffers from many of the design issues above and indeed in story mode is almost silly.  <br />
<br />
The &quot;big Baddie&quot; encounters that are on a timer in many of the zones are fun the first few times you do them but after that really are loot pinata races whose only challenge is figuring out the best way to do the most damage to get the gold rewards.  <br />
<br />
So what do you do at 80?  <br />
<br />
First, give up the idea of &quot;80&quot; in PvE.  You are really just a top tiered character for your zone.  Your &quot;80-ness&quot; is just an indication that you will be nice an powerful relative to where you are.  What I love to do, what makes the game great for me, is going to a new zone and exploring.  I don't mean running from point to point and opening the zone and getting the completion reward.  I mean doing the events, talking to the NPCs reading the text for anyone that has it.  I mean climbing the mountains, poking my nose in the caves and watching the NPC behaviors.  There has never been a more beautiful in depth world as this.  Don't skim the surface and think you have played the game.  Up until the last 2-3 zones these babies are handcrafted and complete worlds unto themselves.  They have meta stories, and like ten mini stories.  Events fit into the patterns of those stories and every zone has weird memorable NPCs with tons of dialogue.  You are definitely rewarded for finding new places.  There are cool events hidden, there are mini boss mob encounters that are challenging.  There are rich nodes and chests in the out of the way places.  This what the game really is... just exploration and encounter.  It's the most immersive game ever made.  <br />
<br />
The second really GOOD thing i have found at 80 is WvW.  Being 80 makes you significantly but not substantially more powerful in WvW.  Being able to trick out your build and gear, afford repair costs and blue prints for siege weapons is a good thing.  It's an advantage but not a huge one. <br />
<br />
WvW is clearly based on the old DAoC style of conquest and keeps.  However, it is much more complex and shifting.  The goals stretch from what a solo player can do with smart guerilla style tactics to hour long keep sieges with hundreds of players.  There are some technical problems right now with the scoring, the graphics and some serious cheating, but overall this is a super fun part of the game.  It also has a nifty cool hat I want so Ima gonna do this for a while.  <br />
<br />
SO that is what I do now... explore places closely and do WvW.  I may start some twinks once I get my money up some.  I still need to do lots of the explorable mode dungeons and I have only scratched the surface of the game based PvP.  <br />
<br />
Given that all of this is for the 65 bucks I orginally paid, I would rate GW2 as the best game out there and certainly the best buy for the bucks.</div>

For everyone else, this is a must do.  It's tricky and fun.  I highly highly recommend not spoiling it for yourself.  It's much better that way.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I am having a rough time with this puzzle all of a sudden.  I took 5 of my characters through it Saturday and it went fine (frustrating, but fine).  Now yesterday and today I can't seem to cross the 2nd vine on the Windy Station section without getting blown off.  And it seems bugged that if you fall off one of the vines, you have a 50+% chance of falling clear to the ground and splatting rather than ending up back on the beginning platform which means you lose your gate attunement and have to redo the first section again :(<br />
<br />
Did the pattern of the wind currents on this 2nd vine change?  Or has it always been random and I just got lucky all those times Saturday?<br />
<br />
I am trying with my Thief and Ranger,  neither of which has Stability that I can see (but I didn't use stability on Saturday).<br />
<br />
Is there a pattern to the wind gusts?  Or is it random?</div>

Some of the particular adventures were good but after level 60 or so the writing sucked.  Like nine characters died whose names I did not even really know or give a damn about.  I was running around hte map for fuck all reason that made sense and then... woot I win!</div>

Now, that having been said... the level down mechanic is AWESOME.  i have at least 15 zones still to do.  SERIOUSLY!  This is the biggest world in the history of MMOs by a factor of 10 I think.  Given that every zone I have done up to say about 50 has been incredibly detailed and well paced, that's tons of fun content left for me.</div>
