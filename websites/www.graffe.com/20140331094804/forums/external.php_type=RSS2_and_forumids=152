			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Have any of you started planting your gardens this year? I have everything planned out and the supplies purchased bu the weather has been shit and would have killed my plants at least twice already had I gone ahead with doing so. I did some test plants last year and I'm going with making a few raised beds with various spices to supplement what is available at the local farmer's market, plus it is relaxing. I'm going to plant some flowers in the holes in the concrete blocks too which should turn out nice. It was pretty fun doing the design and planning everything out. IPython Notebooks were clutch for this for making everything pretty and organized (Program all the things!)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So my wife *finally* had enough on her shopping list to go back to Cub Foods, the only place around here that carries some of the stuff I need to spoof an Olive Garden Salad (lettuce, tomato, pepperoncini, red onion, olives, parmesan, croutons, and an appropriate dressing -- I went with Ken's Caeser) so I've decided that this weekend I will finally be giving the following recipes a try to accompany my salad since I never go to olive garden anymore due to my unwillingness to pay their prices for that food that's never really any better than anything I can make at home.<br />

For the Dough:<br />
<br />
1 package active dry yeast<br />
4 1/4 cups all-purpose flour,plus more for dusting<br />
2 tablespoons unsalted butter,softened<br />
2 tablespoons sugar<br />
1 tablespoon fine salt<br />
<br />
For the Topping:<br />
<br />
3 tablespoons unsalted butter,melted<br />
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br />
1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder<br />
Pinch of dried oregano<br />
<br />
Directions<br />
<br />
Make the dough: Place 1/4 cup warm water in the bowl of a mixer; sprinkle in the<br />
yeast and set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the flour, butter, sugar, fine<br />
salt and 1 1/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons warm water; mixuntil a slightly sticky dough forms.<br />
<br />
Knead the dough by hand on a floured surface until very smooth and soft, 3 minutes.<br />
Roll into a 2-foot-long log; cut into 16 1 1/2-inch-long pieces. Knead each piece<br />
slightly and shape into a 7-inch-long breadstick; arrange 2 inches apart on a<br />
parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with a cloth; let rise in a warm spot until<br />
almost doubled, about 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Make the topping: Brush the breadsticks with 1 1/2<br />
tablespoons of the butter and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Bake until<br />
lightly golden, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, combine the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
with the garlic powder and oregano. Brush the warm breadsticks with the remaining 1<br />
1/2 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle with the flavored salt.</div>

<br />
<br />
Ingredients<br />
<br />
    4 sprigs fresh thyme<br />
    1 large sprig fresh rosemary<br />
    1 bay leaf<br />
    1 tablespoon olive oil<br />
    1 tablespoon butter<br />
    1 cup chopped onion<br />
    2 teaspoons minced garlic<br />
    5 3/4 cups broth<br />
    2 (14.5-ounce) cans red kidney beans, drained and rinsed<br />
    3/4 cup your pasta of choice<br />
    Freshly ground black pepper<br />
    Pinch red pepper flakes, optional<br />
    1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan<br />
    1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br />
<br />
Directions<br />
<br />
Wrap the thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf in a piece of cheesecloth and secure closed with kitchen twine. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a heavy large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion is tender, about 3 minutes. Add the broth, beans, and sachet of herbs. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat, then decrease the heat to medium and simmer until the vegetables are very tender, about 10 minutes. Discard the sachet. Puree 1 cup of the bean mixture in a blender until smooth (optional). Before putting the puree back into the soup, add the pasta and boil with the lid on until it is tender but still firm to the bite. Return the puree to the remaining soup in the saucepan and stir well. Season the soup with ground black pepper and red pepper flakes.<br />
<br />
Ladle the soup into bowls. Sprinkle with some Parmesan and drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil just before serving.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>We adopted two sibling kittens (Clyde male and Bonnie female) in August.  They were 9 weeks old, and are now about 8 and a half months old.<br />
<br />
They're both pretty active kittens and get similar attention from both my fiancee and myself. (both petting and playing.)<br />
<br />
I work &quot;bankers hours&quot;; she's in retail so her schedule can vary.<br />
<br />
For various reasons over the last couple months (mostly weather, &quot;Hi&quot; from NJ) I've telecommuted 1-2 days a week.<br />
<br />
This week we're both out of the house at the same time (which, so far this year, has been unusual).<br />
<br />
The basic daily routine is:<br />
<br />
* I'm up at 5:40 to get ready for work.<br />
* I feed them sometime between 5:40 and 6:30, usually around 6 immediately after my morning prep (but before shower, as I clean the litter box first)<br />
* They get a little &quot;lovins&quot; while I pack lunch then get 5 minutes playtime<br />
* Fiancee gets up, gives playtime and &quot;lovins&quot;, gets ready, and if on her &quot;later shift&quot; feeds them around noon<br />
* I get home around 5pm, feed them a little, play for a while so they nap, then play again around 10pm so they're tired and will sleep and (hopefully) not bother us overnight.<br />
<br />
They have plenty of toys, a few scratching posts, and chase each other around or wrestle.  I have a cat tower mid-construction so that will occupy them eventually too.<br />
<br />
In the mornings this past week Clyde (the male) seems to be a lot more &quot;aggressive&quot; (for lack of a better term) in seeking affection or attention.<br />
<br />
So this morning Clyde was weaving through my legs while preparing lunches, and even went so far as to poke his head into the shower while I was inside.  <br />
<br />
And when my fiancee was getting ready for work, he was &quot;rrrrrowwwing&quot; up against her legs, chasing her through the house, rolling around on her clothes, and being very &quot;pay attention to me&quot;-minded.<br />
<br />
But it's not just this morning - it's been happening since the middle of last week or so.<br />
<br />
It's cute and all and we (believe we) are pretty good at giving them attention... but what could make him suddenly so &quot;me me me now now now&quot; ?<br />
<br />
<b>tl;dr nearly 9 month old kitten suddenly overly affectionate and needy, what's up with that?</b></div>
