 This special test event is open only to Pre-Purchase customers who have  registered their accounts. With your help, we can conduct important  tests and address some of the issues we identified during our first Beta  Weekend Event. During this event, all you need to do is play normally  with a new or existing character on your Beta account using the same  game client. Please note that since this is a stress test of our  servers, you may experience some in-game performance issues. If you’ve  pre-purchased Guild Wars 2 and wish to participate in the stress test,  we recommend that you register the account and download the game client.<br />
 <br />
 Pre-Purchase customers, log in to the Beta Forums for more information and/or to download the Beta client if needed. <br />

			When we announced the release date of <i>BioShock Infinite</i> in March, we felt pretty good about the timing.<br />
<br />
 Since then, we&#8217;ve come to realize that some specific tweaks and improvements will make <i>Infinite</i>  into something even more extraordinary. Therefore, to give our talented  team the time they need, we&#8217;ve decided to move the game&#8217;s release to  February 26, 2013. We wanted to let our loyal (and very patient!) fans  know this as soon as possible.<br />
 I won&#8217;t kid you: <i>BioShock Infinite</i> is a very big game, and  we&#8217;re doing things that no one has ever done in a first-person shooter.  We had a similar experience with the original BioShock, which was  delayed several months as our original ship date drew near. Why? Because  the Big Daddies weren&#8217;t the Big Daddies you&#8217;ve since come to know and  love. Because Andrew Ryan&#8217;s golf club didn&#8217;t have exactly the right  swing. Because Rapture needed one more coat of grimy Art Deco.<br />
 The same principle now applies to <i>BioShock Infinite</i>. <br />
 What does this mean for you? It means a bit more waiting, but more importantly, it means an even better <i>BioShock Infinite</i>.  The great can be made greater, and we owe it to both ourselves and to  you, our fans, to take this opportunity. Irrational Games is one of  those rare developers lucky enough to ask the people who sign the  checks: &#8220;Hey, can we have a few more of those checks?&#8221;<br />
 We are also going to hold off on showing <i>BioShock Infinite</i>  at the big events of the summer, like E3 and GamesCom. That way, the  next time you see our game, it will be essentially the product we intend  to put in the box. Preparing for these events takes time away from  development, time we&#8217;re going to use instead to get the best version of <i>Infinite</i> into your hands in February.

			President Obama declared today that he supports gay marriage,  reversing his longstanding public statements of supporting equal rights  for gay couples that stopped just short of marriage.<br />
<br />
 In explaining his previous stance, Obama told ABC News, “I’ve been  going through an evolution on this issue. I’ve always been adamant that  gays and lesbians should be treated fairly and equally,” citing the  reversal of the Don’t Ask-Don’t Tell policy that barred openly gay  servicemen and women from serving in the military, and the federal  government no longer defending the Defense Against Marriage Act.<br />
<br />
 “I’ve stood on the side of broader equality for the LGBT community,”  the president added, “and I’d hesitated on gay marriage in part because I  thought civil unions would be sufficient ... and I was sensitive to the  fact that for a lot of people, the word ‘marriage’ is something that  evokes powerful tradition and religious beliefs.”<br />
 But, Obama explained, in speaking with friends, family and neighbors over the course of several years, his position evolved.<br />
 “When I think about members of my own staff who are in incredibly  committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are  raising kids together, when I think about those soldiers or airmen or  marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel  constrained, even now that Don’t Ask-Don’t Tell is gone, because they  are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I’ve  just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go  ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get  married,” he said.

The car uses video cameras mounted on the roof, radar sensors and a laser range finder to &quot;see&quot; other traffic.<br />
</span></font><br />
<font color="#333333"><span style="font-family: Arial">Engineers at Google have previously tested the car on the streets of California, including crossing San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge For those tests, the car remained manned at all times by a trained driver ready to take control if the software failed.<br />
</span></font><br />

<font color="#333333"><span style="font-family: Arial">Nevada changed its laws to allow self-driven cars in March. The long-term plan is to license members of the public to drive such cars.<br />

			EUCLID, Ohio (AP) — Campaigning in the backyard of America's auto industry, Mitt Romney re-ignited the bailout debate by suggesting he deserves &quot;a lot of credit&quot; for the recent successes of the nation's largest car companies.<br />
That claims comes in spite of his stance that Detroit should have been allowed to go bankrupt.<br />
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told a Cleveland television station on Monday that President Barack Obama followed his lead when he ushered auto companies through a managed bankruptcy soon after taking office.<br />
&quot;I pushed the idea of a managed bankruptcy, and finally when that was done, and help was given, the companies got back on their feet,&quot; Romney said in an interview inside a Cleveland-area auto parts maker. &quot;So, I'll take a lot of credit for the fact that this industry has come back.&quot;<br />
Romney has repeatedly argued that Obama ultimately took his advice on the auto industry's woes of 2008 and 2009. But he went further on Monday by saying he deserves credit for its ultimate turnaround.<br />
The course Romney advocated differed greatly from the one that was ultimately taken. GM and Chrysler went into bankruptcy on the strength of a massive bailout that Romney opposed. Neither Republican President George W. Bush nor Democratic President Barack Obama believed the automakers would have survived without that backup from taxpayers.<br />
Romney opposed taxpayer help.<br />
&quot;If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye,&quot; Romney wrote in a November 2008 opinion article in the New York Times. &quot;It won't go overnight, but its demise will be virtually guaranteed.&quot;<br />
General Motors posted a record profit last year.<br />
The issue is critical in at least two general election swing states: Ohio and Michigan, where the auto bailouts are popular among some Republicans and Democrats.<br />
The Obama campaign pounced on Romney's statement Monday night, calling it &quot;a new low in dishonesty&quot; and calling on him to have &quot;the courage and integrity&quot; to admit he was wrong.<br />
Romney is scheduled to campaign in Michigan on Tuesday.

			&quot;I  want to be alone and work until the day my head hits the drawing table  and I'm dead. Kaput,&quot; he said last fall. &quot;Everything is over. Everything  that I called living is over. I'm very, very much alone. I don't  believe in heaven or hell or any of those things. I feel very much like I  want to be with my brother and sister again. They're nowhere. I know  they're nowhere and they don't exist, but if nowhere means that's where  they are, that's where I want to be.&quot;<br />

			Purge on disabled a Nazi piece of work<br />
 <br />
<br />
By ANDREW NICOLL, Scottish Political Editor <br />
<br />
<br />
Published: 02nd May 2012<br />
 <br />
<br />
A DOCTOR yesterday likened the UK Government&#8217;s welfare reform crackdown on disabled people to the &#8220;barbarism&#8221; of the NAZIS.<br />
 <br />
Dr Stephen Carty told MSPs they must &#8220;fight back&#8221; against Westminster&#8217;s introduction of tough new tests to see if people are fit to work.<br />
 <br />
He said the policy could push hospital services to the brink of collapse, and warned the Scottish Government not to use the &#8216;Nuremberg Defence&#8217; &#8212; where Nazi war criminals said they were &#8220;only obeying orders&#8221;. Dr Carty said: &#8220;Now is the time to mobilise a campaign of resistance.&#8221;<br />
 <br />
The Edinburgh GP is part of the Black Triangle Campaign, named after the badges the Nazis forced disabled people to wear in World War Two death camps. The changes have seen over a third of Scots Incapacity Benefit claimants passed as OK to work.<br />
 <br />
In Clackmannanshire more than half of those on the sick &#8212; 51 per cent &#8212; were classed as fit.<br />
 <br />
Holyrood&#8217;s Welfare Reform Committee is due to deliver a report on the impact of the changes before Parliament rises next month<br />
<br />

	</div>
</div>note that that line &quot;51% were classed as fit&quot; was after the government brought in a private company, ATOS, to do the medicals...usually by untrained staff with ludicrous procedures that have nothing to do with reality, but are designed to ensure they meet their <b>quotas </b>to be struck off welfare.<br />
yes, they have quotas to chop off, nice, eh?<br />
<br />
Do you know ATOS, to clamp down on whistleblowers, has now made it's staff sign the Official Secrets Act?<br />
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/apr/12/atos-doctors-sign-official-secrets-act" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/20...al-secrets-act</a><br />
Oh I wonder why...wouldn't be because the boss of ATOS is making £800,000 a year now, scragging the disabled via the backdoor and costing MORE money than paying the welfare, because 70% of appeals are proving the patients ARE too sick to work, and lots of other lovely little things like that?<br />
<br />
Mainsteam media are not publishing the rising number of cases of folk killing themselves because of this, because same media has been involved in the abuse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, many of you will ignore me as usual.<br />
Just remember I warned about this a while before, and in years to come when all this is exposed and folk wring hands and offer up scapegoats...<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>GitHub is an awesome cloud service that can help you store and manage your source via the popular version-control system git. You don't just have to use it for source code --- I also use it for lots of my research notes.<br />
<br />
GitHub provides *free* accounts, but you are limited to public repositories (and private gists, which lack the cool interface). However, they've recently started approving upgrades to Micro accounts (up to 5 private repos) for students, and organizational accounts for teachers and student groups. <br />
<br />
For more info:<br />

<br />
I just received a free upgrade to Micro for *2 years*. That's a $140 value!</div>
