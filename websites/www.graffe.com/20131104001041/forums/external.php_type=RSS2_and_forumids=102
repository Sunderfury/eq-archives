			If you've recently fired up Skype you may have noticed a dialog box with a warning appear briefly (at least on OS X) then vanish. If you're fast enough to catch it you'll find that it's warning you that some application you're using that works with Skype will stop working in December, 2013. This applies to all sorts of software supporting headsets, cameras, ... you name it.<br />
<br />
The cause of this annoyance is that Microsoft, in its infinite wisdom, has decided that Skype's Desktop API is to be retired because &quot;it doesn't support mobile application development&quot; and:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			We've been working hard to develop new technologies and make improvements that will benefit Skype users across all platforms, especially on mobile devices. These changes will significantly improve the call quality and speed of delivery of instant messages, while retaining excellent battery life of mobile devices.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The only type of device that Microsoft has anything to say about is headsets on which audio will still work though not their call control buttons ... but that's not the only device type to worry about<b></b>: What about cameras? I have a Logitech Broadcaster Wi-Fi Webcam (<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/toolshed/logitech-broadcaster-wi-fi-webcam-outstanding-portable-video" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I reviewed this product last April</a>) and that's what Skype's is warning me about.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see just what Microsoft does for the vendors of Skype compatible products. If you want to hassle Mcirosoft to make sure the apps and devices you've purchased to work with Skype still work after December this year then start Skype and go to Help then Give feedback ...

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Every time my wife emails me in comes through with the display name Gmail.  This carries into Outlook as well as the Gmail site.  In both places I have her email listed with a display name of Mandy.  I have tried deleting the contacts in both places, waiting a day, and then re-adding the contact.  This too has not worked.  <br />
<br />
Outlook is reading the message as belonging to the contract in my contacts (first thing I looked at).<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any other ideas to try?</div>

			<description>Hey all, 
 
Does anyone have any experience with SAP, particularly the PP module? Or any recommendations for good tutorials/books? Google was kind of a cesspool of results. 
 
Thanks!</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>In outlook (2010) on exchange somethingorother, there is an option to &quot;email calendar.&quot;  Up in the &quot;ribbon&quot; there's a clearly marked button that says so.  The results are annoyingly over-formatted (I would prefer plain text option), but get the job done.<br />
<br />
But that I can tell, there's no way to automate this.  If I want to say, every morning at 7:00 AM, have exchange (or even a running outlook client would be sufficient) perform that exact action, how would I do this?.  Specifically to have this daily schedule emailed to the inbox on my phone so that I can check it first thing when I wake up.<br />
<br />
Yes, there is activesync but I don't want to use activesync for this.  Sub-optimally, having each individual calendar event send an email several hours in advance rather than a 15-minute popup would also work (google calendar can do this).<br />
<br />
Seriously, why do people pay so much for this piece of shit software?  And where's Jonas? Oh that's right, banned.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have used Google Chrome for years and loved it.  Now the past few weeks, they are rolling out some new &quot;enhancements&quot; that are driving me nuts.<br />
<br />
First of all, I have it set to always load a blank page on startup.  A couple weeks back it started loading a Google search page with the daily Doodle and 8 boxes showing my most recently visited sites.  Can't seem to get rid of it, but I can live with it.<br />
<br />
Then today it starts reloading all the tabs I had open when I closed Chrome the last time - no matter what device I was on when I closed Chrome last.  So I got home from work tonight and 4 tabs that I had open at work opened when I started up Chrome.  Even though I have it set to only open a blank tab on startup.<br />
<br />
WTF is going on with Chrome?  How do I get it to follow what I told it to do and only open a blank tab on startup?</div>
