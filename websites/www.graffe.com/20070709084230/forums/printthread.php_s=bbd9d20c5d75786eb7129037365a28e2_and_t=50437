			<div><strong>Wildmagic Strike-It's actually good.</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>Apparently a lot of wizards have not gotten the news that Wildmagic Strike is now a good spell.<br />
<br />
When it was originally released, it had a double resist rate.  First you cast Wildmagic Strike, which may or may not resist.  If it landed, it would instantly cast Chaos Inferno (35% chance), Claw of Selay (35% chance), or Pure Wildmagic (30% chance.)  Each of those three would then have a chance to be resisted.  In the April patch, the original Wildmagic Strike was made unresistable, so it is now a normal one resist chance per button press.<br />
<br />
Yes, if you are going to be resisted 1/3 of the time (FC, AG,) Wildmagic is probably a poor choice.  But with proper debuffs, the vast majority of mobs in the game are not particularly resistant to fire, ice, or magic.  <br />
<br />
And obviously if the fight will be short, you will be casting mostly instants.  We all know those are good when mana is not an issue.  But for most fights, you will have to pay attention to mana and you need to choose different spells to cast in between the harvests.  So this post is a comparison of our efficient nukes.<br />
<br />
With no bard and my current focuses:<br />
Wildmagic Strike 2 (black familiar): 775.81 DPS, 13.89 DPM, 55.87 MPS<br />
Chaos Immolation 2 (red familiar): 694.13 DPS, 10.81 DPM, 64.23 MPS<br />
Claw of Selay 2 (blue familiar): 483.9 DPS, 12.44 DPM, 38.88 MPS<br />
<br />
So chaining CI does less DPS and sucks mana faster than Wildmagic does.<br />
Chaining Selay puts you down at shadowknight DPS levels, and if I am so desperate for mana efficiency, I would be better off sitting down for a tick or two and casting Wildmagic for better DPM.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about other classes buffs helping?&quot;<br />
WMS and CI both have 3.0 second cast times.  So they both make equal use of Mana Flare, Mana Recursion and Arcane Aria.  Claw of Selay (and almost all of our other spells besides instants) have a longer cast time, so don't take advantage of those spells as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Pyromancy and Chillsong that reward you for sticking to one resist type?&quot;<br />
First, if you have a bard in group singing either Pyromancy or Chillsong, you will also have Aura of the Muse available:<br />
WMS 2 (Aura of the Muse): 816.33 DPS, 14.61 DPM, 55.87 MPS<br />
<br />
Psalm of the Pyrotechnic 2 adds 420 damage to fire based spells, and cannot be focused or crit.  35% of my WMS casts will be fire, so it adds an average of 147 damage every time I press that button.  I cast both WMS and CI in 2.1 seconds, with a 2.5 second greyout.  So Pyro adds 91.30 DPS to CI and 31.96 DPS to WMS.:<br />
CI 2 (red familiar+pyrotechnic): 785.43 DPS, 12.23 DPM, 64.23 MPS<br />
WMS 2 (aura muse + pyrotechnic): 848.29 DPS, 15.18 DPM, 55.87 MPS<br />
<br />
Wildmagic Strike is still better DPS and taking less mana than CI.<br />
<br />
Chillsong Aria 2 adds 688 damage to ice based spells, and cannot be focused or crit.  35% of my WMS casts will be ice, so it adds an average of 240.8 damage every time I press that button.  I cast Claw of Selay in 3.6 seconds, so Chillsong adds 112.79 DPS to Selay:<br />
CS 2 (blue familiar+chillsong):  596.68 DPS, 15.34 DPM, 38.88 MPS<br />
WMS 2 (aura muse + chillsong):  868.68 DPS, 15.55 DPM, 55.87 MPS<br />
<br />
Claw of Selay is a  lot closer to Wildmagic's efficiency now, but it still falls short.<br />
<br />
Then there is the dream scenario where the bard can play both chillsong and pyrotechnics.  Must be boring for him, I hope he's a bot:<br />
WMS 2 (aura muse + pyrotechnic + chillsong) 900.64 DPS, 16.12 DPM, 55.87 MPS<br />
<br />
&quot;But we all know Claw of Selay sucks.  Why aren't you comparing to Icefall Avalanche?&quot;<br />
IA 2 (blue familiar): 921.38 DPS, 10.09 DPM,  91.33 MPS<br />
IA 2 (blue familiar+chillsong) 1005.28 DPS, 11.01 DPM, 91.33 MPS<br />
<br />
See Yakk's thread here to see why mixing Wildmagic with instants beats Sothgar's, Icefall, and Ball Lightning.  Also notice in the 15th post how much he has to change those spells in order to make them useful.<br />

Prathun promised to make our other spells useful someday, but as it stands right now, Wildmagic is one of the best we have.<br />

		<div>you posted allot of info but there is a good reason why we don't use this or spells like claw or ci.<br />
<br />
currently our mana can never get to the point of even considering using those spells without instants and casting to many of those imo is more wasteful. also this spell only works 1/3 the time with focus drakes and many end zones now are immune to one resist line.<br />
<br />
that's why you see wizards saying IE and icefall are the new claw now. even these spells can fall behind of our current mana regen depending on proc Rng. of course if spells like icefall and ie could eat mana about 2x as fast at same efficiently then ya may get to use spells like these more but just isn't the case atm!</div>

		<div>Yes, I too am curious if you brought damage familiars into the equation or how you calculate dps when many wizards have focii that are dramatically different.  My fire focus is excellent, my ice focus kind of sucks, and I frequently have no reason to don my magic focus item because my better spell haste item uses the same slot.</div>

I can't believe you people are actually making me quote myself.<br />
<br />
I never tried to claim this is the only spell you should be using.  The question was never &quot;What spell should we chain cast without thinking?&quot;  It was &quot;What spells should we mix with our instants, and in what ratios to get the best results?&quot;<br />

Also, you have to take into account what we learned from Yakk.  I already linked his thread, but here it is again in case you missed it:<br />

<br />
In that thread, a lot of people are asking Yakk, &quot;Why are you using Wildmagic instead of SpellX?&quot;  The fact that Wildmagic is better than SpellX in most situations is what prompted me to make this thread.<br />
<br />
Casting 50% Wildmagic Strikes and 50% Flashfires is almost the same DPS and MUCH more efficient than chaining Sothgar's.<br />
<br />
Casting 50% Wildmagic Strikes and 50% Flashfires is better DPS and about the same efficiency as chaining Icefall Avalanche.<br />
<br />
Nuking patterns with IE have not been calculated yet.<br />

<br />
That's the entire point of my calculations above.  In each one, I explicitly told you which familiar I was using.  Each time, I showed that even though Wildmagic only takes advantage of focus familiars 1/3 of the time (or only takes advantage of bard songs 1/3 of the time,) it is still better than the alternatives.<br />
<br />
Currently my fire focus is 10% better than my magic focus and 15% better than my ice focus.  I am striving for better focus items, but right now my guild needs to start farming some new targets before any are available to me.  I can't imagine walking around with only two improved damage focuses.  You know you can get an ID6 augment from a soloable mob in Sunderrock or from tribute?  30% focuses for all three types are available for single groups on Praetorean gear or in various places in TSS?  Those are a lot better than nothing if you can't get raid drops.<br />
<br />
Well now I am taking my own thread off topic... but I thought that every wizard thought like me: maximizing focuses is the first priority in choosing gear.<br />

		<div>with instant it may be good, i'm just wondering if the 75% mana spent on instants really does even out the efficienty.<br />
<br />
also keep in mind the procs on IE lets you spend 2k of your mana at  a claw average ratio but is a bit risky.<br />
<br />
<br />
__<br />
edit btw i suck at math but it seems rk 2 wildmagic strike averages out to 2121 base damage.<br />
<br />
without focus and focus drakes(just looking at base damage), now add that damage to rk3 flash and looking at 6430 at 4.685 mana ratio every 4.25 seconds. do however gain more gorm procs, better resist rates and MR procs but does that even out the damage compared to IE(a 5 base mana ratio btw) with some occasional mr instants and ec or instants on the procs? i cant say.</div>
