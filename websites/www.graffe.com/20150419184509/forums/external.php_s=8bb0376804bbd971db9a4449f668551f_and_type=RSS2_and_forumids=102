			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have a deilema on what kind of laptop to choose.  Basically, because I am in school and got a scholarship this year I'm able to get a laptop and deduct it from my taxes.  It's important to note that I'm going to school for computer programming.  (I'm actually 38 and have prior programming experience but I'm going for the official degree now).<br />
<br />
Because I'm going for programming, higher resolutions are important to me.  I use a 2600 resolution monitor for every day work and I've found it invaluable when writing code.  Trying to transition to 1300 or even 1080p is not pleasant.  However it's also for school, so portability can be important as well.  Although I don't know how often I'll take it to school since most classrooms have computers already and I take most of my non programming classes online at home.<br />
<br />
For many reasons I wont go into I've narrowed down my choices to two options, both Lenovos.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y50-uhd/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops...eries/y50-uhd/</a> (the 1399.99 model)<br />
The first one is basically a gaming laptop that fails as a gaming laptop but excels at everything else.  This one is great for obvious reasons.  Fast processor, lots of ram, good video card.  It will handle programming, multitasking, video editing ect.  The downside is that it's bigger to carry around and 2lbs heavier than the other one. but it's still only 5.29lbs and 0.9 inches thick. not unreasonably heavy or thick. (Yes, i know it's not a true 4k screen as well, but I'm ok with that.)<br />
<br />
<a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops...ies/x1-carbon/</a><br />
This one is basically a large ultraportable.  Regardless of resolution I think a 12 or 13&quot; ultraportable would be annoying to write code on or do lots of reading.  So this is a balance between the two at 14&quot;.  The problem is that the last one in the series got terrible reviews (that they claim this one fixed). And even if those items are fixed it's roughly 1/3 to 1/4 the processing power of the first one.<br />
<br />
Basically my dilemma comes down to the fact I want an ultraportable, or at least something light weight and smaller but expect I'll regret the limited processing power as I do use it for much more than just programming.<br />
<br />
I did also look at the Yoga 3 pro. and while it looks awesome it seems to be getting mixed reviews.  You're basically overpaying for average hardware.<br />
<br />
It's also important to note that I've already purchased the first one, it arrives today.  But there's just that nagging feeling I'm making the wrong decision.<br />
<br />
Anyone have an opinion?</div>
