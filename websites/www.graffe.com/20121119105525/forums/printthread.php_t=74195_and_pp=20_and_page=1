The difference that people can manipulate both with guided missiles......  Something the real world economy does not have yet.. well not in the sense of Apple and Google or Exxon and Shell declaring war on each other and blowing stuff up.   Not that Google has much to fear from Apple in a war,  thanks to their new iOS6 mapping system they would shoot a missile at Mountain View and hit Montana.</blockquote>

</div>I am fairly certain that that was said by no one ever.  I think the writer misrepresented Castronova's comment, and that Castronova's intent was to present that information from the perspective of the businesses rather than from his own perspective considering that he was one of the first people to study virtual economies, so it does not make sense for him to claim that his study was of no benefit to businesses.   The section reads better if Castronova is saying those things as reasons businesses are apprehensive about working with academics.  <br />
<br />
Also, as someone who participates or participated in virtual economies (D3, WoW) for fun, I always wished that Blizzard would hire one of the elite economy players to help with the economy, as often Blizzard's actions were incompetent wrt the game economy.  It was obvious that Blizzard had no one on staff who was specializing in this matters such that he or she was paying attention to what was a huge part of the game environment for everyone involved.  With how inexpensive an economist is compared to overall budget, it seems reckless not to have an expert on hand to guide this process.  Often times the devs just lash out at players who play the economy instead of trying to fix issues, perceived or real.  And, as a result it was the niche players who were extremely knowledgeable about the economy but were never sought out for input as to how things could be improved.  A number of the players are in finance professionally in addition to their game economics hobby.</blockquote>
