			Rice said there were no Marines present to protect the consulate in Libya, saying the U.S. presence is Libya is &quot;relatively new&quot; since the revolution that overthrew former dictator Moammar Gadhafi.<br />
&quot;There are not Marines in every facility. That depends on the circumstances. That depends on the requirements,&quot; Rice said. &quot;Our presence in Tripoli, as in Benghazi, is relatively new, as you will recall. We've been back post-revolution only for a matter of months.&quot;<br />
But Rice said there was a &quot;substantial security presence&quot; at the consulate in Benghazi, noting that two of the four Americans killed there were providing security.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>This means security was provided by DSS - great guys, but just overwhelmed by the situation. What will likely happen from now on is that an element from a MEU (probably a company) will likely be stationed at any new consulate or embassy until a proper MSF force can be brought in.</blockquote>

			<div class="message">Repeating the same appeals to emotion louder and with more hyperbole is not persuading.  I'm the original &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; forum member, you know, and even I know that there is a limit that has been crossed too many times with regards to Libya.  One righteous man in a crowd of angel-rapers isn't enough to save the city.  And we need solutions that don't come out of a Robert Ludlum novel.  Thriller fiction is a fun read for many, but it's not a legitimate foreign policy.  Sometimes the Armed Forces are a necessary part of foreign policy.</div>

</div>As far as I can tell, both sides are using appeals to emotion and hyperbole. We know for a fact that our government lies. I have known it since Iran / Contra (at least). We know they lied and manipulated data as a pretext to the Iraqi invasion. We know that the media mouthpiece is little more than the propaganda arm for corporate war interests. Yet -- here we are, agitating for more of the same, using 4 dead Americans as our justification.<br />
<br />
I still love you, but I don't trust your propaganda anymore than I trust the rest of it. We don't know anything EXCEPT that we are continuously lied at and manipulated by vast interests in collusion above the rest of us. That is too thin a justification for carpet-bombing civilian populations, no matter what color they are or whose fucking flag they wave around, burn or treat like a holy relic.</blockquote>

</div>She thinks the protests themselves were spontaneous, but still blames the end result on an unspecified group of extremists hijacking the mob. The possibility of the original protest's intended purpose being to start a premeditated chain of events across the region has also still been left on the table.<br />

</div>Gaddafi had this mad dream of being the sort of &quot;the super antiImperialist&quot;, against all the colonial powers<br />
never ever said the guy wasn't a nut or a bastard<br />
jsut I don't believe he was the &quot;demonic&quot; nut he's portrayed, more like possibly genuinely insane (certianly by the end he was) but the kind of &quot;mad&quot; that actually &quot;works&quot;, at least in his earlier days, if know what I mean?<br />
but he escalated it with the USA/UK and such things have a bad habit of getting carried away with the weight of inertia etc.<br />
*both* sides have blame.<br />
See hwo it began over pissing contest over territorial rights and almost certainly oil dominance.<br />
Bloody silly, isn't it?<br />
<br />
note I do not think the CIA are all bastards despite my jibes, many I'm sure are genuine concerned patriots, merely that you always get groups within such that take &quot;ends justify the means&quot; to extremes and make things worse, OR politicians order them to do things the guys at sharp end know are damn stupid, and lets be honest, there's certain strata/areas where such &quot;spooks&quot; have real risk of being more of a problem to their own country than the enemy. <br />
idealogy, shot term political gains, perosnal advancement etc are bad mixtures in such critical areas. idealogical zealotry was big problem with US doctrine in such for long time.<br />
<br />
and the USA's lack of coherent long term foreign policy again shot itself in the foot when it could have manipulated Gaddafi into much more stable areas of, if not direct benefit, at least not harm to the US.<br />
whole middle east is riddled with such rivalries etc that if played well, USA could have had much of the groups eating out of the proverbial palm of it's hand.<br />
But the USA f*cked itself in the ass again and again.<br />
<br />
the whole point is NOT to win, instead, it's not to <i>lose</i>.</blockquote>

Scrag the bastards responsible, or better yet, grab them put them on trial in a NEUTRAL country to show US honesty. Throw oil on troubled waters, not napalm :P<br />
work with genuinely smart diplomacy to turn Libyan groups (there many of them) away from the islamists and to nationalist/secularists (dont' men hard core nationlaists I mean grousp with far more &quot;nation state&quot; beliefs, high risk nation could break up)<br />
<br />
&quot;smart&quot; diplomacy is damn hard, as noted to Cilumnik, USA desperately needs a coherent, stable LONG term foreign policy<br />
the chaos and seeming treachery of US foreign policy has massively inflammed the situation letting the Wahhabists and their ilk run rampant<br />
<br />
see UK's actions in say, ireland/Northern ireland. bad moves, screw ups, arrogance etc inflammed things.<br />
Force of arms doesn't work unless you plan on absolute butchery.<br />
want/expect US troops to wipe out civilians?<br />

</div>&quot;Yes, there are lots of innocent Muslims. But there were lots of innocent Germans and Japanese too, and we bombed the FUCK out of them, because they were ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY. The victors write the history books, so will the 21st Century see the writing of history books that tell of how Islam crushed all the infidels of the world, or will the 21st Century see the writing of history books that tell of how militant Islam was defeated by the forces arrayed against terrorism?

<br />
Railways Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour said he would pay the reward for the &quot;sacred duty&quot; out of his own pocket.<br />
<br />
The comments came a day after at least 20 people died in clashes between anti-film protesters and Pakistani police. Friday's violence occurred in cities throughout Pakistan, with Karachi and Peshawar among the worst hit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will pay whoever kills the makers of this video $100,000,&quot; the minister said. &quot;If someone else makes other similar blasphemous material in the future, I will also pay his killers $100,000. I call upon these countries and say: Yes, freedom of expression is there, but you should make laws regarding people insulting our Prophet. And if you don't, then the future will be extremely dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
His ANP party, which is part of the governing coalition, told the BBC this was a personal statement, not party policy, but added that it would not be taking any action against him.<br />
<br />
The prime minister's press secretary, Shafqat Jalil, told the BBC that the government absolutely dissociated itself from Mr Bilour's statement. &quot;He is not a member of the PPP, he is an ANP politician and therefore the prime minister will speak to the head of the ANP to decide the next step. They are not ruling out action against him but say he will stay in his post for now.&quot;</div>

<br />
&quot;I didn't know about a specific target apart from the work I was given to do,&quot; he told Fox. &quot;I was aware that some terrorists were residing in that compound, but I didn't know whom. I was shocked. I didn't believe I was associated with his killing.&quot;<br />
<br />
He said that the CIA had advised him to flee to Afghanistan. However, he was scared to cross the volatile border region and did not think it was necessary to escape because he did not consider himself to be involved in Bin Laden's death, he said.<br />
<br />
Dr Afridi was arrested at a checkpoint at Hayatabad on 22 May last year, 20 days after Bin Laden's death. After this he says he was blindfolded for eight months and handcuffed for a year in a prison beneath the ISI headquarters in Islamabad.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to bend down on my knees to eat with only my mouth, like a dog,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
During interrogations he was tortured with cigarette burns and electric shocks, he said, as the ISI rebuked him for helping the US find Bin Laden. &quot;They said: 'The Americans are our worst enemies, worse than the Indians,'&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
Dr Afridi said that he himself was &quot;proud&quot; to work with the CIA and would help the US again, despite the torture and psychological abuse he said he had suffered. &quot;I have a lot of respect and love for your people,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
There has been no official response to Dr Afridi's allegations, but the Pakistani authorities have always insisted that they treated him the way any country would someone found working for a foreign spy agency.<br />
<br />
In his comments to the BBC, Dr Afridi's lawyer said that if the comments were genuine they would &quot;certainly add to [Dr Afridi's] difficulties in coming days&quot;.</div>
