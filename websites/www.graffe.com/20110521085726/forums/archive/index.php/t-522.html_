I was telling Deb (in jest) that, if she wanted, I'd get a tattoo in the collegiate font style right in the pubic hair area, above my twig and berries, that says &quot;Property of Deb&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a tat on either upper arm.  Both Dragonlance chapter illustrations.  Not very original, I suppose, but I happened to like them, and since they're outlines they'll look good even faded. <br />
<br />
Absolute wierdest tat I ever saw was on a former platoon sgt of mine.  Guy was Wiccan, and got a warding circle done on the back of his hand.  Looked pretty cool, and I'm sure it helped with his magic, but that sucker had to hurt like crap going on.  Back of your hand is all bone and no meat, so every milimeter is skin between needle and bone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the funny thing about that is that my ex-wife's name was Debbie, also.  Eep!<br />
<br />
So, Deb just laughed off my suggested &quot;Property of Deb&quot; tattoo with the remark that I would just go find another &quot;Debbie.&quot;  PSHAW!  ;)</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's the small out in the sticks area I live in, but I know very few artists that could actually do the color fade on the leaves like that without making a mess of it.<br />
<br />
If I had any idea how to host and link a pic I'd put one up of mine.  It's on my left shoulder blade.  A wolf (a fascination of mine) on a cliff howling.  A blue moon with some nice cloudwork behind him.  I had it face towards the center of my back in case I decided to expand it someday.<br />
<br />
9 years later, now that I've finally found the woman I know is 'the one', I'm thinking of what I want to add to it.  Something that represents her, without just adding her name :)<br />
<br />
Considering having the rest of my back worked out into a full scene.  Extending the rocks of the cliff down to look over a grassy clearing and small pond, with a white tiger lounging beside it.</div></div><hr />
