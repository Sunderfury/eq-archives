		<div>I am sure parses will come, most guilds are taking a break from raiding to let people level and such.<br />
<br />
It will take a little time to sort out the numbers. For high end raider question becomes how far can our high DPS strats be extend . If they prove too expensive to be usefull in most situations you will see a lot of unhappy wizards.<br />
<br />
We are limited by 3 nukes and if we have to step away from that DPS takes a dive.<br />
<br />
We also come off TSS/TBS where wizards ruled, we have very high expectations and for good reason.<br />
<br />
From Beta chatter I can tell you that rogs and necros are looking for substantial upgrade to DPS. I thought that our 4k burn strat (60 sec fights) was great untill necros told me they can burn for 4k now. This is all very much preliminary and I am not sure who is putting what in numbers.<br />
<br />
I am disapointed with SoF, I think it is a bad expansion for wizards. I am taking a little break atm and I will not be much help. So I am watching you all for clues.</div>

		<div>dont have any good parses for beta raids because the spells changed around 3 days to launch. prathun didn't add stuff like decent resist checks to ecs, tss <br />
spell revamp(many thought he wasn't even going to do that), and instant resources till about last Friday.<br />
<br />
 also solteris focus effects didn't change till about  month ago so further offsets the parses. speaking of focus, the new ones were rolling almost max most of the time  too which messed up allot of  parses while that bug was in. so most parses before last friday are pretty much botched.</div>

<br />
Parse of the clear to Beltron from Harfange. Another mostly useless parse, but the interesting bit is 1) I beat le pallies! (top 5 is 1 wizard, 4 pallies) 2) It's sustainable dmg, I ended clear with 70 pct mana. <br />
<br />
As mentioned, I have subpar focus gear, so add another 20-25ish pct to the overall dmg and I'm guessing you are where lvl 75 spells can now take you with CI/Soth/FF, EC on GoRM, bard playing new pyrotech+aria and aura.<br />
<br />
All in all, from the clear above and a group I had yesterday, I'd say sustained dps is around 2k for TSS geared toons at lvl 75. Dunno if that's more, less or same as before revamp?</div>

At best, using 10 minutes for total time, your damage comes out to 1100 total, and I'd guess probably a bit lower than that in the 1000-1050ish range probably unless Varakx didn't have any downtime at all between mobs.<br />

The parse is shit, yes, main point is that it's sustainable. No matter what it evens out at, I did more dmg than the paladins, who usually rule on the undead clears (and place near top in boss fights, usually), and could have kept going. Improvement. Substantial even.<br />

If you are trying to support changes to our spells this is not going to help your cause. <br />

If you like what SoF brought your class you can argue that Prathun is a genius or that this is your preference and it suits you better. Simple fact is that most of wizards, those that like and dislike this change, will not use sustain metrics as an argument.</div>

Actually, there's already been plenty of people claiming it to be higher dps, I'm missing the parses though. I personally haven't done a burn fight yet, since the change. When I do, I'm more than likely to be parsing it, and since I'll post one such to guild, might as well post it here as well.<br />
<br />
However many wizards cry over the loss of their instants, doesn't change the fact that we had a spell revamp. People should be showing us why it sucks, not claiming it repeatedly on a messageboard with acid rich bile dripping from their posts. Alot of us weren't in beta, we cannot see all the proof/parses that was posted there.</div>

There is not much I can say that will change your mind. I have written a lot of stuff and I have explained at nauseam what bothers me about the changes and how and why they have been implemented. You have looked at few posts that give you numbers that are situational and called me angry and resentful.

Here's another one liner just for you:<br />
<br />
lol@Gavrilo<br />
<br />
@Kela, read the part where I said that the important bit was that I could sustain it :p Pallies = AFK dmg and they've been topping parses on clears easily since we started FC, which is why I liked the fact that I moved past them. I wasn't comparing the dmg to anyone else on the clear. I know they werne't doing their best, it's a given, it's a clear :p But again, pallies = AFK dmg.<br />

In all fairness, I only parse myself.  I only do this to tweak my casting and assure myself that I am &quot;being all I can be&quot;.  So far, there are not enough points on this one encounter I chose to highlight to make an issue about dps being affected - except for one thing.  There is a parse posted by the guild on this fight, so not only do I get to see my own parses - I get to see how it compares to others in the guild.<br />
<br />
My dps went from being top, or first, to 5th.  While my parse remained essentially the same, with maybe some drop (again, not enough points to ascertain) - several others boosted parse dramatically.  I am happy for the zerkers and rogues who got this boost, it makes our guild that much stronger.  I am not happy that anyone could beat a wizard on burst dps - it is our role.<br />
<br />
For reference, parses include maximum use of wands, early parses included an AA harvest, where you see the parses jump includes use of a Kiss.  Pre-nerf parses ended with me just reaching, or very close to being oom.  The post nerf parse, I used the Kiss, and ended the fight with 42% mana.  This is a fairly long fight for burst dps - and it amazes me while saddening me that wizards can't make use of a full bar of mana + boosts, because this means - we are not the burst dps the class was designed for.  Since it is early yet in this expansion's release, expect our dps to drop even more dramatically compared to melee gains once people have factions done and enter zones with higher end gear.  Our new spells and our new AAs will in no way match the gains experienced by melee, sorry to say.  Before the next release (next year), expect to see wizards being mid-range dps at best in comparison to all other classes.<br />
<br />
Any of you remember GoD?  Tipt?  Being excluded because we were not considered &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;essential&quot;?  I never want to see that again, but there is a lot of potential of seeing us fall off consideration for groups, missions, due to becoming less desired over any other class LFG.  The true damage of this nerf is yet to be felt, but it's coming.</div>

				First of all I can't figure out why the forums won't allow my EQ players's sig... other people have it, tells me mine is too large.<br />
<br />
Anyways... RF is a lovely gem. With Envenomed Blades + Frenzied, its a deadly combination for outputting some massive damage.<br />
<br />
On a recent parse for orc in event 3 Solteris, just after getting level 80 and have rank 3 of RF and rank 1 of Envenomed Blades, I put out 4769 dps. Prior to the goodies SoF brought us, with same gear as I have currently mind you, I was pushing at around 3k max dps. Now I am not very high end geared really, no solt weps, just Ember and cudgel from TSS, so I don't do huge damage anyways, but for me and I think for anyone, thats a NICE increase. Other rogue in my guild managed 6.2k dps as well...<br />
<br />
Happy hunting with this one rogues!

Im not too concerned with the casting changes, but im struggling to see how we're going to keep up?<br />
The above isn't an awful lot of info, we dont know what the rogs did or didnt use, but the poster was seeing a 60% increase just for hitting 80 and a few AAs. Though sustained wont see that much as alot is to do with their new aa disc.<br />
<br />
Crimson Tempest i believe if we have any wiz from there about.</div>

Look into the new research clicky scrolls to use during spell gem refresh for an extra 100 to 200+ DPS.</div>
