			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, as a parent, I am now ready to start to wall off portions of the internet.  Up to now, I have been using a more proactive approach, monitoring and restricting usage and no special software.  But my kids are getting more savvy and wandering sometimes into places they really shouldn't be going, and i would like to control their browsing habits a bit more (plus the habits of their little friends who come over).<br />
 <br />
Any suggestions?  I'm open to all advice, from parents and non-parents.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>HIGHLIGHTS<br />
<br />
Station Voice is now available! <br />
Equipment changes have been introduced to improve item progression from levels 1 – 59 worldwide. <br />
Check out the sections below for details on these highlights and other details of “Storm Break” (GU47). <br />
LIVE EVENTS<br />
<br />
&quot;Storm Break&quot; (GU47): Librarian Feldarn of Freeport's Academy of Arcane Science and Librarian Dungil of Qeynos' Concordium are looking for volunteers to help battle the onslaught of darkness from beyond. <br />
Qeynos and Freeport have broken ground on major construction projects just off of the coast of Antonica and Commonlands respectively.  Visit the docks to see the new activity! <br />
STATION VOICE<br />
<br />
A new Voice Bar will appear that provides options and indicates who is currently speaking and when you're talking.  It can be docked with any chat windows. <br />
A new Voice Users window will show all users in the current channel.  This window can be changed to be transparent and show only active speakers if you'd like. <br />
Group and Raid windows have speaking indicators to show who is currently speaking. <br />
Voice options are available in the Options Menu under the &quot;Voice Chat&quot; tab. <br />
If you're not currently in a voice channel, you will be placed in the first channel that becomes available.  Subsequent channels that become available can be selected through a dropdown on the Voice Users window, a button on the Voice Bar, or a link that appears in text chat. <br />
Left Control is the default push-to-talk key.  You can change the key in the &quot;Voice Chat&quot; tab of the Options Menu. <br />
If you need more info, do &quot;/help vchat&quot; in game. <br />
Also, you can see a mini-feature on the EQII forums.<br />
<br />
HELP<br />
<br />
The help system has received an overhaul.  Many game windows now have a help button in the upper-right corner that will open the appropriate help topic.<br />
<br />
ENCOUNTERS<br />
<br />
The Tangrin and Avatar of Growth encounters now warn players three seconds before it's time for them to start moving. <br />
The Tangrin will no longer spawn a new beehive if any raid member already possesses one. <br />
All Named and Boss NPCs in Kunark now drop Adept I and Master I scrolls equal to or lesser than their level. <br />
Many of the named creatures in Sebilis, Chardok and Karnor’s Castle no longer have place holders, have a longer respawn time, and will now always drop legendary rewards. <br />
The random Adept I and Master I spells you get while killing creatures in the level 1-20 range will now only drop spells you or your group members need. <br />
QUESTS<br />
<br />
Adventure writs now award 500 faction points per completion. <br />
Adventurers working for the city of Neriak will now gain faction with the Agents of Neriak, Queen Cristanos’ eyes and ears in the outside world of Norrath. Gaining faction will lead to new city rewards! <br />
Adventurers working for the city of Gorowyn will now gain faction with The Watchers of Timorous, a group of sarnak which stand vigilant in the defense of their homeland.  Gaining faction will lead to new city rewards! <br />
A new shade of formal wear is now also available to those who are ranked as ally with any city writ faction. <br />
Page 5 of &quot;A History of the Vah Shir, Vol. I&quot; is now tradeable. <br />
The quests that awarded potions/elixirs from the Hand of Marr and Brethren of Night camps now award more. <br />
The quest “Vision of Fear” should no longer continue to offer the quest when a player walks through the entrance tunnel in Feerrott. It has been moved to a nearby curious totem that can be clicked to obtain the quest. <br />
The quest “A Calling in the Forest” should no longer continue to offer the quest each time a player walks over the Commonlands bridge in Nektulos Forest. It has been moved to a nearby skeleton laying on the bridge that can be clicked to obtain the quest. <br />
RACIAL TRAITS<br />
<br />
Dark Elves <br />
Innoruuk's Gift now grants the full 2% spell critical amount. <br />
ITEMS<br />
<br />
RoK Legendary Armor Sets:<br />
<br />
The Wayward Moon set has been removed from the drop tables and replaced with the Sylvan Moon set which is only equipable by Furies and Wardens.  Those wishing to replace their Wayward Moon pieces for the new Sylvan Moon pieces should speak to Joonius Khristus in Teren’s Grasp. <br />
The Enigmatic Sacrifice set has been removed from the drop tables and replaced with the Cabalistic Sacrifice set which is only equipable by Defilers and Mystics.  Those wishing to replace their Enigmatic Sacrifice pieces for the new Cabalistic Sacrifice pieces should speak to Joonius Khristus in Teren’s Grasp. <br />
Adornments attached to Wayward Moon or Enigmatic Sacrifice set pieces will be lost in the process. <br />

<br />
Wrath of Nature (Fury) <br />
Now gives out damage and heal amount bonuses. <br />

Improved the healing power of aftershock. In the vicinity of 75% of the heal.  Also added casting and reuse bonus of 15% and reduced the time from 2 seconds to 0.5 seconds. <br />
The mythical version’s intervene effect has been replaced by a powerful group cure which will cure arcane, elemental, noxious and trauma effects.  In addition, when it cures an effect it will also heal the player for each effect it removes. <br />

Adds an additional hate position boost to Insolence. <br />

This increase includes accessories, armor, and weapons, as well as many tradeskill items. Shields, items with special effects, and tradeskilled armor have not yet been changed. <br />
House items now observe the 'Lore' flag, allowing only one of a lore item to be placed in a home.  The 'lore' flag has been removed from house items and pets that are primarily decorative in nature. <br />

Tradeskillers who are skilled enough to see the tradeskill collection quests may find more rewards available in their travels. <br />
Armorers now have a recipe for imbued devout ebon greaves. <br />
The fuel requirement for imbued rosewood shields has been corrected. <br />
The fuel requirement for ashen hearths has been corrected.  <br />
Imbued fulginate devout greaves can now be created. <br />
Sparkling Cranberry Wine has been converted to Cranberry Cream Liqueur to avoid confusion with the existing Cranberry Sparkling Wine. <br />
ZONES<br />
<br />
Bloodline Chronicles<br />
<br />
Adventurers may now zone into any of the Tombs of Night and the Crypt of T’Haen zones that a member of the group has access too. Previously, these zones were only accessible if everyone in the group were on the same stage of the quest. <br />
Players can now zone into any of the Tombs of Night zones if anyone in their group is on the appropriate quest. <br />

Shaman <br />
Shaman’s wolves should now have slightly more health to help their survivability. <br />
Fighter <br />

Berserker <br />
The Blood Rage line will not expire until the berserker dies instead of having a 15 minute duration. <br />
Scout <br />
Sinister Strike should no longer debuff the target if it misses <br />
Assassin <br />
Fatal Followup should no longer be useable after Sinister Strike. <br />

dunno if you can see the video, basiclaly, a gulley is used to channel waves into a big concrete bunker (from rocky shore), <br />
the wave movement compresses air in a chamber, <br />
this air ram pushes AND pulls on a turbine, generating power as waves rise and fall.<br />
since it's built on waters edge rather than a device in the water, in a concrete large structure, it's easy to work on and upgrade etc.<br />
<br />
very interesting, it generates power for 1,500 homes :)<br />
seems about, oh , 40 metres long 30 metres wide by 15 metres high?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Several of the core members of my corp, me included, have pretty much decided to  strike out on our own.  Here's why: (sent privately to selected corp members. . )   Remarkable lack of guild drama, just irritation at our current situation. . .<br />
<br />
****<br />
There have been some disturbing developments on the AWTS front, that I wanted to discuss with you two:<br />
<br />
And, no, you're not the only ones we're talking to. Several other people are getting this chat today, either by email or in private chat in game.<br />
<br />
1. We're. . .concerned about some financial matters. Large amounts of ISK (we're talking 100 million ISK plus) have been deposited into Corp accounts, and then disappearing without explanation. Those of us who contributed were told we needed the money for an Alliance. Money is gone, no alliance. Likewise with Ore and Weapons/Ammo donated. Gone, no trace, and no explanation<br />
<br />
2. CEO Motion: where is he ? His Corp is at war, and nobody has seen him since Sunday Night (by east coast North America clock, anyway)<br />
He had a major assignment due on Monday. It's Thursday now, where is he ?<br />
<br />
3. Security and the War. Two nights ago, Mounzer and I moved out of Autaris, because The Doctrine had learned that AWTS was hiding out there. We then moved 4 systems out to Oimmo, and only the officers (Motion, Mounzer, Dangira, Slidver and myself) knew where we relocated to. And yet last night. . .the Doctrine was camping us in Oimmo.<br />
<br />
So it's obvious we have a double-agent amongst the officers. Circumstantial evidence points towards Motion. He's either blabbing or playing us for fools. Either way, it's bad.<br />
<br />
What are we going to do about it ?<br />
<br />
Mounzer and I are discussing a break with AWTS and forming a new corp. You two are some of the people we'd like to take with us. More details as they develop.<br />
<br />
What can Mounz and I offer you ? Well, a logistics base, for one. I can build Caracal cruisers, Drake and Ferox battlecruisers, Badger II haulers, and Heavy Missile setups and ammo. The aim would still be mining and missioning, but with a growing industrial, and soon, a research base so we can start building Tech 2 gear. . .<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think, but I'm also requesting you keep quiet about this. We're seriously worried about the security compromise within the Corp. . .<br />
**********<br />
<br />
Suggestions ?  We're currently on the fringes of Empire Space in Lonetrek.<br />
<br />
Any and all advice is welcomed. . .</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This is going to be a rather week rant so feel free to move on.  The last few months while extremly caotic has been good chaos.  Lets see first the good, my daughter was born 6/6/8.  Delivery went without a hitch for the most part.  Patosen (sp) is some damn interesting stuff.  So my life was in for a Big change anyhow.  The Wizard Drama of here of late while not really affecting me much while I've been afk has been a Tiny bit annoying. And I'm losing my job/insurance...  <br />
 <br />
I was told after much of the last year until <i>june</i> believing I had a full time job where I work, that it is going to go into vapor in a few weeks.  I smartly decided to go finish the degree this summer.  So now I have a BS Mathmatics I can hang on my wall whenever it gets here.  I thought I could at least get a decent job in Atlanta.  I can't even get a fucking interview much less a job.  Every Damn thing requires 2-3 years experience or a masters, but wait there is a metric FUCKTON of jobs availiable.  Just not for me :(.  I know I choose a degree that dosen't have a lot of upside job wise but its not like I'm some Fucking art history major :rlymad:.  I just want a job making half of what I made last year in a nonskilled job this year in a skilled job.  And hell at this point I'll do any damn thing that buys dipers, formula, raman noodles, and pays my house note.<br />
 <br />
See my gpa isn't what it should be, mostly because my first four sememsters at GSU.edu I failed a class.  Two because the prof was a dick once because I forgot to withdraw and once because half the damn class fails every damn semester.  I think I can sort of reserect it enough to teach High school if I spend another year in school gpa building.  In fact thats what I did this summer, Making a B+ in Accounting I, and a B in a Psyc class.  I should be able to get unemployment for 6-9 months starting in september that will pay for the above things with what my wife makes, who by the way is starting school again this month. Did I mention above We have an 8 week old.  My mom dosen't work and is providing free child care atm, but I'm not exactly sure how long she is willing to do that for us.<br />
 <br />
So this is my Dilemma, say fuck it file Bankruptcy lose my house and cars, go live with my inlaw's (my wife would go crazy with my parents) for the next three years, my wife needs to graduate and get a job.  While I get a job to pay back the credit cards that we still have to pay after bankruptcy, get my GPA to a 2.5 and get a job or go teach.<br />
 <br />
Or I can try and strugle through hopping God above smiles on my family and I get a Job making half what I used to.  While we focus on my wife's education (she wants to do early childhood education).  The potential upside is tremendous but the downside is fucking horrendous, if I don't get a job and then we can't afford to file bankruptcy, still lose the house and cars and live with my inlaws for the next fucking 7-9 years while our credit recoups...<br />
 <br />
Fuck this economy and our Fucking Dimwited Disengaged Destoyer of the American Dream our president aspires to be.  I guess deep down I knew this would happen, but I was just hoping it was the little pecimist in me.<br />
 <br />
I thought I went to college to avoid the Struggle/grind/struggle/grind that I've seen so many people cycle through, but I guess I was just able to suspend it for a few years.  Shit I could have graduated 3-4 years ago but I knew I would have to take a pay cut to get a job, Now I have to take a pay cut but the econ is FuxxxxxxxxxxxxxSword and thier isn't a job for me to do apparently.<br />
 <br />
Ahhwell glad this place is still around.  Even if I haven't been around here in awhile.</div>

<br />
My daughter is taking an honors Math course this year (5th grade) and I have a feeling that she is going to need some additional home tutoring. Sadly its been many years since I had college level Algebra myself, and it doesn't look as if finishing my AA requirements towards a Bachelors in English is going to be particularly helpful either (though I suppose I could take a &quot;Mathematics for Liberal Arts Majors&quot; course if it came down to it).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div>

				&quot;Women named Jill and Hillary should be raped.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those are the words of &quot;AK-47&quot; -- a poster to the college-admissions web forum AutoAdmit.com. AK-47 was one of a handful of students heaping misogynist scorn on women attending the nations' top law schools in 2007, in posts so vile they spurred a national debate on the limits of online anonymity, and an unprecedented federal lawsuit aimed at unmasking and punishing the posters.<br />
<br />
Now lawyers for two female Yale Law School students have ascertained AK-47's real identity, along with the identities of other AutoAdmit posters, who all now face the likely publication of their names in court records -- potentially marking a death sentence for the comment trolls' budding legal careers even before the case has gone to trial. <br />
<br />
The unmasking of the posters marks a milestone in a rare legal challenge to the norms of online commenting, where arguments live on for years in search-engine results and where reputations can be sullied nearly irreparably by anyone with a grudge, a laptop and a WiFi connection. Yet a year after the lawsuit was filed, little else has been resolved -- and legal controversies have multiplied. The women themselves have gone silent, and their lawyers -- two of whom are now themselves being sued -- are not talking to the press. Legal experts are beginning to wonder aloud if there's any point in pressing the messy lawsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have good lawyers putting their time in on the case, and in a policy sense, they are achieving something, says Ann Bartow, an associate professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law. &quot;But in a victim sense -- assuming you think of the women as victims -- it's not clear what this is going to achieve.&quot;<br />
<br />
The AutoAdmit controversy began even before one of the women, identified in court documents as &quot;Jane Doe I,&quot; started classes in the fall of 2005, the lawsuit alleges. Doe I was alerted in the summer to an AutoAdmit comment thread entitled &quot;Stupid Bitch to Attend Law School.&quot; The thread included messages such as, &quot;I think I will sodomize her. Repeatedly&quot; and a reply claiming &quot;she has herpes.&quot; The second woman, Jane Doe II, was similarly attacked beginning in January 2007.<br />
<br />
Both women tried in vain to persuade the administrators of the AutoAdmit.com site to remove the threads, according to the lawsuit. But then the story of the cyber-harassment hit the front page of The Washington Post, and the law school trolls became fodder for cable news shows. Soon after, the female law students, with help from Stanford and Yale law professors, filed the federal lawsuit in June 2007 seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages. <br />
<br />
The Jane Doe plaintiffs contend that the postings about them became etched into the first page of search engine results on their names, costing them prestigious jobs, infecting their relationships with friends and family, and even forcing one to stop going to the gym for fear of stalkers.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have never had such a way to lie and distort facts about people -- to spread lies and distortions in a way that is attached to them,&quot; says Bartow. &quot;And you can game it to come up on the front page of Google.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bartow believes the problem lies in technology outstripping the law and our cultural responses. George Washington University Law Professor Daniel Solove, who's been thinking about the issue long enough to have written a book called <a href="http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/dsolove/Future-of-Reputation/index.htm" target="_blank">The Future of Reputation</a>, agrees. He says the law needs to change.<br />
<br />
&quot;The internet isn't a radical-free zone where you can hurt people. But on the other hand, we can't have everyone rushing to the court, because the court is a blunt tool,&quot; Solove says. &quot;We need something to help shape norms -- there needs to be some kind of push back against the notion that the internet is a place where you can say what you want and screw the consequences. That's not what free speech is about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since libel lawsuits are mostly about clearing one's name, Solove finds himself lamenting the lost ritual of duels, which he describes as an elaborate nonjudicial way of settling disputes that rarely actually got to the shooting phase.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have any middle-ground dispute resolution processes in society anymore, and courts aren't a good way to vindicate these non-monetary harms,&quot; Solove says. &quot;I think we need something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
One idea gaining traction among legal thinkers would be DMCA-like legislation permitting victims of defamation to issue take-down notices, asking ISPs and websites to remove false and damaging user posts. If the service complies, it would be immune to any legal action.<br />
<br />
But that regime hasn't worked entirely well with copyright -- false DMCA notices have been used by everyone from the Pentagon to the psychic Uri Geller to remove content from YouTube. <br />
<br />
Jason Schultz, the acting director of the Law, Technology and Public Policy Clinic at UC Berkeley, says it would be a mistake to bring that regime to bear on controversial speech online.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you run the risk of too much take-down,&quot; Schultz says. The hurdles and expenses of a court fight act as useful checks on those who would suppress speech, he adds. &quot;I think you need procedural hurdles in place since we are talking about a constitutional right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even relying on current liability law, the AutoAdmit case has trod on dangerous ground. <br />
<br />
The lawyers for the two women originally named one of AutoAdmit's administrators, Anthony Ciolli, then a third-year law student at the University of Pennsylvania, as a defendant -- even though Congress intentionally shielded electronic service providers from responsibility for what their users post online.<br />
<br />
Ciolli's former lawyer, Marc Randazza, says Ciolli never wrote anything defamatory, and was named in the lawsuit simply for leverage, in an effort to get the site owner to change how disturbing material was handled on AutoAdmit.<br />
<br />
&quot;As an attorney, I found it really offensive that Ciolli was being held hostage to these people's demands on a third party,&quot; says Randazza.<br />
<br />
Solove is not nearly as sympathetic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of reason people were so upset with Anthony Ciolli was that they believe he stuck to his guns and defended things on free speech grounds,&quot; Solove says. &quot;People want to see some sort of contriteness.&quot;<br />
<br />
After months, the Jane Does finally dropped Ciolli from the lawsuit, but that did not satisfy Ciolli, who filed his own lawsuit in March 2008, accusing the women and their lawyers of improperly listing him among those who made the rude comments. <br />
<br />
The women's lawyers -- Yale's David Rosen and Stanford's Mark Lemley -- declined repeated requests for comment.<br />
<br />
A federal judge ruled in January that the attorneys could serve subpoenas on ISPs and webmail providers. Using that power, the lawyers have unmasked some -- though not all -- of the AutoAdmit posters.<br />
<br />
Now they're asking the judge to give them additional time to try and determine the identities of the remaining defendants, who are currently being sued under their AutoAdmit handles: among others, PaulieWalnuts, Cheese Eating Surrender Monkey, The Ayatollah of Rock-n-Rollah, Patrick Bateman and HitlerHitlerHitler.

<br />
As many of you have seen by now, SOE as a company has decided to integrate Vivox voice chat into many of its games, EverQuest included. We are in the planning stages of the whats and hows of the integration right now. I think this will be a great new feature for the game and the fact that it will be free of charge is even better.<br />
<br />
I know that voice chat is a feature that can sometimes be divisive amongst groups of players-you’re a player who doesn’t like chat on a raid where most everyone else is on voice chat, or you’re in a group where there is no text chat going on because everyone is using voice. We will certainly do our best to make the use or non-use of this feature as flexible as possible, and obvious as to who is using it and who isn’t.<br />
<br />
Of course, participation in voice chat will be totally optional-you’ll be able to switch the feature off entirely if you like. Of course, we can’t control what policies your groups or guilds put in place. This is an interesting new form of netiquette that has arisen over the last couple years-made even more interesting by adding a feature like this to already established games. Yet another part of the social evolution of the Internet.<br />
<br />
We’d certainly like to hear your feedback on ways we can make this new feature work well for both the &quot;voice chatters&quot; and the &quot;silent types&quot;.<br />
<br />
Here is the Press Release:<br />

<br />
I'm running XP Professional and Office 2007 Ultimate.  When using Excel, after a few minutes, the screen goes all wonky and a message pops up saying Excel cannot complete the operation due to low system resources.<br />
<br />
This is on a machine with a 500G hard drive and 2G ram, with nothing else running at the time.  It also happens on my laptop more frequently.  I upgraded to the Office SP1 thinking that might help, but it seems to have made it worse.<br />
<br />
I've Googled and found several suggestions (turn off the Adobe add-in, clear the Windows /temp folder, etc.) but nothing seems to solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else hit this problem?  How did you solve it?</div>
