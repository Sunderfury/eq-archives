<br />
Russian private server running Blade and Soul - beautiful action-combat Asian MMO.<br />
Free to play (have to create an account on the site) - there's a cash shop, but it's convenience items.<br />
<br />
It's been out in Korea and China for a while now (since 2012 or so), I actually believe that it's NCSoft's biggest MMO in those markets.<br />
Doesn't look like an EU or US release anytime soon, although there has been some rumbles about positions opening up in the US in 2015.<br />
<br />
I'm dabbling a bit in a couple of characters there. Nothing serious, but I love the combat system - combos, some over-the-top fighting.<br />
Questing is the usual collect 10 bear asses, but that's par for the course.<br />
<br />
Fair warning: The localization looks like it was done by running Chinese trough google translate to russian and then into English. You'll get the ghist of what you're supposed to do on quests, but the sentences are  strange :)<br />
<br />
Graphics are beautiful, character customization is crazy, and their physics are... interesting :grinyes:<br />
<br />
I'm Szaarina, by the way. Shoot me a tell if you decide to try it, there's only one server :)</div>
