But &#8220;Star Wars: The Old Republic&#8221; was made free-to-play, not unlike Zynga's social games, where users can pay to become more powerful or advance more quickly through the game. It&#8217;s a new kind of business model that doesn&#8217;t deliver the kind of consistent stream of revenue that EA typically sees. Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson said this &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; game is now on track to become &#8220;one of the biggest flops of all time.&#8221;</div>

			<description>Level cap was 40 (out of a possible 60 I think).  I got to 32 on a cleric.  Overall, the game is a not ready for prime-time pile of mediocrity.  There are some highlights however and I will start with those for people to see if it might end up their cup of tea:

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Level cap was 40 (out of a possible 60 I think).  I got to 32 on a cleric.  Overall, the game is a not ready for prime-time pile of mediocrity.  There are some highlights however and I will start with those for people to see if it might end up their cup of tea:<br />
<br />
Good Stuff:<br />
<br />
The main story lines (one for each zone) are good.  They are entertaining and are supported by lots of solo instances that are fun.  The story instances can be done with other players if you want but are fully solo-able for when you just want a chunk of gaming.  They do not seem repeatable though unless you go with another player. <br />
<br />
The Foundry Missions still seem to be where this game will be good.  There were no new missions to play and the Foundry itself was not open yet but a couple of the missions that there are already show off good story telling and fun complexity that can be designed by fellow players.  There are fun opportunities for triggered events and lore placement as well as stuff you can do to individualize your adventure.  It looks like there will be lots of graphical diversity for building different kinds of areas.  I played on in a version of Hell a guy made and it was all fiery and red and black.  The real problem seems to be the mediocrity and boringness of loot.  It looks like the game itself controls what can drop and you cannot personalize it.  <br />
<br />
Action combat is fun.  I ran lots of instances which were well done.  Boss fights are appropriately challenging and the highest one I ran had a hella evil dragon that my party could not kill since we had a lot of stand in shit players and we were underlevelled.  There is a definite skill to bouncing around combat, aoe-ing and single targetting.  It was fun.  In outside combat, not so much, just really repetitive gameplay.  However, in dungeons things happened faster with tougher mobs that had special abilities to avoid.  Blocking, dodging and teleporting are good and pretty well done.  It was easy to see the WoW players all standing still and the GW2 players all dodging.<br />
<br />
Event system.  You can queue for anything you want from anywhere in the world and the game finds you a group.  It's not a sandbox game at all but that sort of thing IS mighty convenient for when you just want to run something or do someone's new Foundry mission.  <br />
<br />
The Bad<br />
<br />
Animations.  They suck.  Several people here are animation Nazis.  Don't play this game.  The animations are fucking retarded.  My cleric slides on the floor when he dodges like he is bowling.  THe wizard runs around half bent over with two fingers up like a Hunchback Hippie.  Horses do the slow running in jello thing.  God there are a lot of crappy animations.  If animations bother me then you know they suck.<br />
<br />
Character development.  Pretty much not a factor.  No real development, no real diversity.  Really sucks.  You can slot some different spells but meh not a big difference.  Not 4th Edition.  People are complaining that the game lacks the diversity of 4th Ed.  It's a dumb complaint for an MMO.  You cannot really capture the complexity of character development from pen and paper.  However, this has crappy character development for an MMO.  You are just another cleric.... just another caster etc.  Seriously, Diablo character development blows this away.<br />
<br />
The world is pretty boring standard linear and small.  You go to a zone, stay there for ten quests and move on.  There is a story but it's short and standard fantasy stuff.  Each zone has a contest in it which is kinda fun but rewards sucked so I stopped doing them when they came up.  <br />
<br />
Gear.  Gear sucks.  It drops all the time but it doesn't matter.  It has little effect on the game and the good stuff is all in dungeons or bought with dungeon tokens.  You'll outlevel it all long before you get much use out of it.  <br />
<br />
Money system.  Forget it.  Complete crap.  You cannot even use the auction house without some kind of a currency that you only get by praying or from other players or buy with another kind of money you buy with real world cash.  This sucks.  Really, do not play this game unless they figure out a way to take game gold and convert it to this currency.  <br />
<br />
TL:DR Might be worth it for Foundry System, otherwise pass unless you are an MMO SLut like me.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Haven't seen any threads on this yet, but I'm really enjoying this game.  It is free to play, and free to download, courtesy of a couple of guys from New Zealand.  There are microtransactions, which they seem to be using to support everything.<br />
<br />
I'm really enjoying it; its still open beta although supposedly there will be no more character resets or wipes.  6 classes, based off 3 stats (int, dex, str).  Very similar to Diablo 2, including waypoints, scrolls for portals and ID, divided into Acts,  and levels of difficulty (normal, cruel, merciless).  There are also events and leagues (sort of like hardcore mode).  Skill tree is massive, and each class starts somewhere different on it.  It is multiplayer much like D3; you will only see other players in hub areas, but your party will go to whatever instanced zone you go to.<br />
<br />
So, if you enjoyed Diablo 2, this is seriously worth the time for being entirely free.  Check it out.  And if someone posted about it and I didn't see, I apologize.<br />
