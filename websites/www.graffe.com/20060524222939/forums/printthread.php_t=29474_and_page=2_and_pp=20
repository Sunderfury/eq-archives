		<div>The first line of GM response is almost certainly outsourced, and they seem to <i>always</i> respond with a canned message on the general topic, without any regard to the text of your petition where you explicity say you did all the things they are now suggesting you do. If you are lucky, you can get further action on the second round where they actually pay attention to you, and if you are really lucky, you get one of the local GM's who actually can do something for you. It's just like insurance companies, they try to filter out all the stupid petitions by adding a few levels of automatic responses. Trouble is, it makes it difficult for legit concerns to get through in a timely way...which I can't help but think is also deliberate. People just say, &quot;the heck with it,&quot; and don't follow through, so there is less for them to have to worry about.<br />
<br />
Which all boils down to lousy customer service, in my view. You shouldn't have to work so hard to get proper attention, even if you are being stupid and your case has no merit (which isn't what is going on here, to be perfectly clear). You are a paying customer, and due at least common courtesy and proper attention - not an ill-considered canned response.</div>

		<div>*shrug* every time I've been in a group where someone had to petition it was always answered within an hour and the problems were always solved.<br />
<br />
Just the other day we had a bad pull, evaced and a group member had left a shard but did not die, it was strange...anyway there was no shard for him to retreive so he petitioned and it was given back to him in 45min...<br />
<br />
If you guys are gonna complain about CS, EQ2 is not the game for doing it.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with EQ2's Customer service.  I don't care if they operate out of Iran, the job is getting done as of right now.<br />
<br />
In the case of glinlor's ticket, it looks to me like he got the quest updates from harvesting but sold or destroyed the items before talking to the wholesaler.  If that's the case all you have to do is buy some from the broker and you should be good to go.</div>

		<div>I think the real key would be to simply re-petition w/ a more descriptive overview of the problem and why you can't finish or delete or get a new TS Task.<br />
<br />
If you do an updated petition, you will also likely get a different CS rep, and in ANY customer service organization there is always the one guy who is horrid.<br />
<br />
Just give more detail like exactally what the problem is.  (like what you did on this board)<br />
<br />
I bet you they fix it if they can.  Also, did you actually follow their advice and /bug it?  It may be that the way the system is that CS reps cannot modify quests, if such it true, /bug may be the only way to get it fixed.<br />
<br />
A great example is that there was a bug awhile ago that if you auto banked something from the bank it would disapear.  I /bugged it.  About 2 weeks later, I found a bunch of the stuff I had lost in my overflow slot.  About 2 months later I found a couple more things :).<br />
<br />
Give it a good /bug that is very descriptive on how exactally to reproduce your problem and do the same on a petition.<br />
<br />
I agree w/ someone else who said &quot;i love how the description of your problem which you gave to us was quite detailed and informative...nothing at all like the CS ticket you turned in...&quot;<br />
<br />
Reading what you posted in your ticket I would interpret that you simply do not understand how to finish the quest.  Passing you off to getting help from your players is exactally what I would do.  It isn't a CS reps job to walk you through a quest.  &quot;I can't figure out how to do step X&quot;.  Now I understand by your post here that understanding how to finish the quest isn't the problem.  But by what is said in your ticket, I would have responded just as they did.</div>

Hey fanboy, that was my 3rd petition.  They have a history of the past ones, anyway they should have responded to me.  I was online, I saw the ticket update and I could not add to anything further, in fact when I made that I was fully expecting a responce, not what you see in that screen shot, further more I was never given the chance to talk to them.   And don't even get me started on the 5+ hours ot took to answer it.  AND furthemore they keep telling me to ask my fellow players.  So, if you have all the info now you tell me what to do. I'll be waiting So if you want to make smart ass comments you better have all your ducks in a line and stop asumeing that I did post all the history with the CS here.  They had all this info and more, they know everything that I said here.   And that was the last responce I got, right now Iv had a CS ticket in for three days and I missed the GM two times, one responded while I was at work in vendor mode and the other responded at 11:40pm when I was in bed, again in vendor mode.  So, this is still open although the two trys to back in touch with me are nice</div>

		<div>You should be able to reasonably estimate what tier level the collection quest was from, you just have to know what lvl your wholeseller society was back in novemeber.  After that you can just go and buy 15 of each type of common harvest from that tier.  I suspect its prob tier 1 components so your best bet would be to buy 15 iron lead machalite and whichever the tier 1 wood is again I forget.  I agree you shouldn't have to do that  and its easily fixed by putting the item name in the message telling you to go back to your wholeseller.</div>

Sure, i'll tell you what to do:<br />
Pay attention to what you're doing while you're in game.<br />
<br />
If you hadn't disposed of whatever it was your wholesaler wanted, you wouldn't be having this problem, now would you? I mean, c'mon, the quest tells you explicitly that the wholesaler wants you to bring back X number of items, common sense would tell you that you would have to have X number of items with you when you returned to the wholesaler to collect your reward. Did you really expect to receive a reward without turning in the required items?<br />
<br />
So here you are, the venerable Glinlor, crying waaah, waaah, waaah because you weren't paying attention to what you were doing, and you mucked things up.<br />

		<div>The second Tier of wholesaler tasks ask you to CREATE something . They don't actually mention that you have to bring them back. They are not gathering quests once you change to the second wholesaler society. It is not really possible to buy 15 of every thing he could ask you to create.<br />
<br />
The suggestion of mentoring won't work. Mentoring affects your adventurer level not your tradeskiller level. <br />
<br />
All that said the wholesaler tasks are not a big deal. Just ignore it until you get to the next level society and you can get new quests from them. <br />

In Everquest at one point they had a Email your GM thing. I always got better service that way. Do they have that in EQ2?</div>

Do you remember what you ate for dinner back on November 12th of 2004?  I don't think so, and in all that crap you posted you never once said anything useful, unless you simply could not resist the chance to try and flame me and you did a poor job of that as well. Anyway when I came back after some time of being away from the game I probably did sell them not knowing or remembering what they were for.  And anyway I never said It wasn't my fault did I? I made that point very clear, what I needed help with was fixing the problem, and my <b>original post was not really about my problem so much as the lack of help I was getting from SOE support to help me solve my problem</b>.   <br />
