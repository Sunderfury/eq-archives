Our cat mew died recently.  <br />
<br />
We took her to a local vet where the vets in charge of the practise graciously allowed us to make payment arrangements in order for our cat to be seen.   Nobody  could figure out what was wrong so they gave her some fluids and antibiotics and sent us home with instructions to bring her back if she got worse.  When she took a turn for the worse the asshats at the front desk basically told us that since we already owed them money we could pay up front and extra for not having a prior appointment we could take our sick cat home to go die. Once we got to speak with the doctor he could clearly see that she wasn't well and agreed to see her anyway.<br />
<br />
It turns out the prognosis was grim, total kidney failure, cause unknown.  She was suffering and had to be put down.  I've never had to do this and it was fucking heartbreaking to hold her while the vet injected her but there was nothing else to be done for it and so we said goodbye to the smallest member of our family.<br />
<br />
So we go today to make a payment on our bill and pick up poor mews ashes and that heartless bitch of an office manager tells us<br />
 A) They wont sell us flea meds for our other 2 cats unless we pay our bill in full first, this is not the original agreement<br />
 B) They will not give us her ashes until they are paid<br />
<br />
Thank you for making our fallen family member a bargaining chip to ensure you get your $145.  I hope it was worth your heart and soul you fucking evil heartless bitch.</div>

First of all, the price was a buy it now or a best offer fixed price.  Shit or get off the pot.  As soon as you bid $10,000 on my $15,000 buy it now price... I checked out your ratings.. although you had nothing but positive feedback, the most recent comment on a feedback gave me pause when it said:<br />

		<hr />
	</div>
</div>No I am not going to tell you what the best deal is I can give you.  Bid and fucking find out.  I don’t care where you live or how or if you choose to come look at the truck in person.  My price has nothing to do with your location to my location.<br />

</div>Dude that hurt just to read.  Quit drooling over your porn, use the space bar and shift key and learn to proof your messages before you hit send.  And by the way, no I am not shipping the truck to you. Can’t you fucking read?  It says very clearly in my ad that the buyer is responsible for shipping. <br />

	</div>
</div>I suggest you buy a dictionary, a grammar reference book, and a book that teaches you how to proof read before a buying a truck.  You seriously need it.   Also, it’s none of your fucking business what my highest bid is so far and why the hell would I not take the highest offer??? :wtf:<br />

		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I see that you are desperately trying to live out some e-penis driven dream to own a super fantastic hot rod truck.  But if you have to keep asking about the lowest price, then obviously you can’t afford it. If I haven't answered you in the previous three messages.... I would explain it to you, but let’s not overwhelm the few brain cells you have.<br />

Please contact me as a second chance offer if your primary offer of 12000 does not go through otherwise I will buy it straight up for the 11k plus shipping help whichshouldnt be more than a couple hundred. You can call me at any time”</i>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>:thwak:  Shut the front door! Did you really just say that?  Seriously dude, you are trying to rip off an old lady!  This truck is belongs to my mother. My late father rebuilt this truck from the frame up himself. He put his heart and soul and $30,000 into it for which it is appraised at.  She has to live with me because she can’t afford to live by herself on what she makes in social security and is only just now willing to give the truck up because she can’t drive it and it’s not good for it to sit. You should be fucking ashamed of yourself and go crawl in a hole and die for not just making a nuisance of yourself, but for making such a pitiful offer and then expecting her to pay for you to drive it or ship it home.  Just go the hell away dude you are giving me a headache.<br />

</div>Ah no...Mom decided rather than sell the truck to a fucktard like you who tries to circumvent the eBay bid system with desperate private messages of pitiful offers and then expecting her to pay for shipping as further insult to injury...she’d rather donate it to charity.<br />
<br />
........<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
The real story is we just sold the truck off my craigslist ad for cash at a higher price than we listed on eBay.  All fucktard had to do was bid another thousand and he would have won the eBay bid for our lowest acceptable offer (not that I expected any bid by him to be a valid one).</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Every single thing I did today (sunday) pissed my wife off. From baking bread for the week, to making a week-long batch of baba ghanoush, to not picking up potatoes at the grocery store. I pissed her off. FUck up beyond fuckup beyond fuck up. But half an hour ago, my wife came downstairs and asked me to have sex with her, and I was more than happy to oblige. <br />
<br />
I had 3 (maybe 4?) glasses of whiskey and club soda, and actually managed to get hard enough to please her. She rode me out while I played with all her spots that count and made her orgasm, get off me and say, &quot;thank you, goodnight&quot; with a smile. <br />
<br />
Yay whiskey dick. You kept me hard but dulled my senses. Did not bust a nut or anything, but fuck yeah am I happy, because I can fuck up on everything, but knowing that I made my wife happy on her last thought of the day is the best feeling for me. ANd now I'm as flaccid as the last, wet, and forgottong spaghetti noodle at the bottom of the coriander, and everything is fine. <br />
<br />
Yay whiskey dick!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Man, This could be a quick one, or a long one, but the reason why I'm ranting is because normally I can either rant to my brother-in-law, or my wife, and it is the quick bite of explaining the problem that finds the solution that I need. Only this time it effects all three of us. <br />
<br />
My wife and I work for the same company. So does my father-in-law and my Brother-in-law. My father-in-law is my boss. he helped my wife get her job with the company. She helped me get my job with the company. My FiL helped my BiL get the job. <br />
<br />
Basically, I've been working on 3 different buildings with very little interruption from anything or anyone else for more than 2 years. They're both buildings that when I first took over them, I felt like I had no idea what I was doing, and that I would have to use my practical knowledge on the job, and at home with my free time, unpaid, learning how to design my own experiments for providing solution. As time went on, I got a little more comfortable with each of these properties. I developed my own methods of solving problems (fun!), maintaining working systems (eliminates problem solving!), and rehabilitating vacant units to modern building comparisons.  <br />
<br />
With a tremendous background in IT, Customer Service, Parts Warehousing, and Home Appliance repair, I often made solutions to problems using my background in all of these. Unique to my position, when I didn't understand something completely, I would use my smart phone and view an explanation of some kind over youtube. Or get an obscure parts catalog through an archive of PDFs, or something similar - I learned my own way of dealing with this by learning how to solve problems that I was unaccustomed to by using resources that i was accustomed to. It worked, and sometimes I felt like I was just barely getting by - perhaps one day I would be found out as a &quot;hack.&quot; <br />
<br />
Turns out, because there were so few problems coming out my district and my buildings, that no one in corporate was paying attention. My father-in-law, my direct supervisor, seldom needed to get a phone call from me, and assumed I was skating (an analogy that I was just gliding by and the buildings I was on were actually 'easy.' ) <br />
<br />
My brother-in-law (if you haven't figured this out by now, he is my father-in-law's son), joined the company about a year ago. he got hired on as a very specific sort of hard-labor position, for construction crews, special projects, and the like. During that time there was alot of work necessary for him, and he was able to gopher alot of things among people more experienced than he, and learn as much as he could. However, he was really relied upon as a gopher. SO he never really got his fingers dirty, or his noodle cooked (problem solving). <br />
<br />
THat type of work in our company is largely now complete. The construction and large rehab jobs have gone down specifically, and most of those teams have gone onto floating maintenance positions. The two realms are night and day. He (my BiL) has had the last 6 months as a substitute, floating around from property to property in the portfolio, whenever someone is ill, whenever someone needs an extra hand doing something, what have you. And his responsibilities have been limited to that of a helper - not commandeering a role as a standalone individual, but instead just assisting. <br />
<br />
Last month, one of the highest paid individuals in our team got injured on the job and is going to need hip replacement - hello 6 months off the job for he. <br />
<br />
So my BiL subbed in for this individual, and looked forward to finally having his own building - at least for a little while. For 3 weeks he followed around the injured individual in his wheelchair while he showed my BiL as many aspects about the job as he was willing to, giving him an idea for how to do things, how things worked, etc. <br />
<br />
My BiL also had a week of vacation coming up at the very end of the injured employee's final month before prepping for surgery. He wasn't too worried. He'd spent 3 weeks there, he'd take his week of vacation, and be back on the building the day after laborday with a fresh month ahead of him. <br />
<br />
Only that wasn't what happened. <br />
<br />
They had to get a substitute for my BiL's vacation. The substitute they got could not wing it. He was also from the previous construction crew, and I guess he just got way too overworked, or something. Then, on Thursday of last week, I get a call from my boss (my FiL). He says corporate isn't happy with the building my BiL had been working on. A couple bad things happened this past week with the substitute, and he needs me to step in and fix some problems immediately.  <br />
<br />
I already have 3 buildings on my plate, and I can't take an additional one as huge as the one he's talking about and still handle my other 3 - not to mention, I've got deadlines and other obligations on my buildings I have made to managers and corporate supervisors. my boss is insinuating this is going to be a permanent move. I'm very confused, because that building is supposed to go to my BiL - &quot;We'll put him on yours, and it'll be an easy change.&quot; I'm immediately saddened. 3 years of comfort, and now I'm getting transferred. I begged and pleaded that I had to have at least Friday to complete two tasks whose timelines I'd build to be finished by the end of month. <br />
<br />
Corporate granted me that. I figured I'd be on easy street by then. Corporate would see that my BiL was back, I'd call my supervisor (FiL) in the morning, and we'd have our original buildings back in eachother's possession. Right? <br />
<br />
WRONG. <br />
<br />
The transfer stayed into effect and I got the new building and moved on. My BiL got my old buildings, and I was bummed - he was going to have it so easy - or so I thought. <br />
<br />
ALmost from the get go, i was getting telephone calls from him about different things. I didn't have a problem with that. i actually sort of expected it, because it would only warrant that sort of necessity to go jumping into the fire on a building never having experience on. Not to mention, I had a bunch of things organized to stream line the projects I had coming forth, and not sorted into a manner of normal categorization. (Paint measured out specifically for particular places, parts allotted in boxes for specific tasks, etc - this was easy enough to walk him through). <br />
<br />
The managers of the buildings which I worked upon had a very comfortable rapport with me - almost to the effect of luxury. if i was on their building, they knew I would be easily accessible to tenants, and those manages would go about their day without a care in the world. I honestly didn't mind. If I have questions that need their attention I sent them an e-mail, a text message, or call their cell phone. Its is not something spelled out in our handbook or job description as an official procedure, but I am not one who grasps technology by proceeding officially - if you get my drift. They started to give my BiL a  not-so-friendly reflection in their dispositions because he wasn't as quickly at providing answers or solutions as I always had been. They didn't have the rapport they had with me. THey were all starting fresh, and were bitter, and were not team players. I got the feeling from text messages or phone calls I received from them that they were dissatisfied with the way he was responding to requests or procedurally doing things. For everything they would tell me about, I got the impression, more or less, that he wasn't doing a single thing wrong - they were just upset that I was no longer on their building and they were going to be starting anew. Essentially, it seemed to me, that they felt if they acted like assholes to him, they would just in turn get me on their buildings again, instead. Selfish, right?<br />
<br />
I want to interject right now, just something about background with my BiL. He's not as well learned as me. He doesn't have the background of University that I do. He didn't grow up with a computer attached via fallopian tube, and he certainly doesn't get his knowledge base via wiki and youtube. He grew up with a huge heart taking apart motors to cars, and boring out engines, and making things bigger and faster and louder. He's a very compassionate, and kind, and outgoing person, and learns through steady observation and interaction as opposed to literature and technology. <br />
<br />
Allow me to return now to the problem. <br />
<br />
I had a new building of my own - a large, and very intimidating building - mostly because I was out of my comfort zone for the first time in over a year. I was reluctant about driving an extra 10 miles every day to the same place every day, and having to learn where every key went, where I was going to get lunch at, and who lived where, and what each valve looked like, and each breaker, and everything else that comes with a new place to &quot;live and forage for survival.&quot; <br />
<br />
I didn't call my BiL once. I called the guy who was out on injury once, and i asked my BiL one question on an occasion he called me. THe manager of this building took notice and started telling tenants everytime they called things like, &quot;Oh! We got a new maintenance man, btw, and he's very well skilled at his job, and he's a fantastic individual, and you're really going to love him.&quot; My reputation began to precede me. <br />
<br />
In all my life, as the fuckup of my family - the one who didn't finish college. The one who had that drug problem. the one who has the alcohol problem. the one who always runs up his credit cards. the one who barely finished high school - my reputation has never &quot;preceded&quot; me. Not in this way. <br />
<br />
For the first time in 14 years, I was actually successful at something. Not in my eyes. I saw everything I needed to improve upon from the start. I saw what was not working previously (signs say for years), and started building plans to correct these as soon as I got the property caught up. I saw it all as a great hurdle and a tremendous challenge, but one I knew if I stuck to my methods I'd learned previous, i could possibly come out of this alive. <br />
<br />
My new building manager was already requesting a raise for me, and my &quot;temporary replacement&quot; status to usher in its permanence, and telling my corporate supervisors that stood about my FiL that I had methods she never was aware of, like repairing appliances instead of replacing, and IT related assisted methods of problem solving and solution finding. I am still very reluctant. I know that I am the fuck up. I'm not the glory man. i just do what is asked of me and have learned that saying &quot;no&quot; or &quot;i don't know&quot; aren't acceptable answers. <br />
<br />
So here I come today. And after I get home, a long day, exhausted. One of the fullest sets of 8 hours I've ever pulled as efficiently as I pulled it today. As I pulled it the last 4 days. My BiL called his sister (my wife) and needed some clarifications of his job responsibilities. I realized a phone call he made to me earlier in the day trying to find a solution didn't work. Despite me asking him to call me back if it didn't work, and I'd help him find another one fell on deaf ears - deaf ears of pride. <br />
<br />
My wife handed me the phone, and we started sorting some things out. This big ox of a fun-loving guy was actually crying on the phone, upset that he'd had to call me 10 times a day to find solutions, and I had only had to call him once, and that i was receiving corporate blasted praise via e-mail, and he was just trying to bale water out of his sinking boat. <br />
<br />
This is the strangest moment of my life. Nowhere near as scary as the labor &amp; delivery of my two sons, but by far stranger than the circumstances. <br />
<br />
For the first time ever, my wife has trouble in her mind with choosing how to give her compassion to both sides - to her brother for feeling like he's not good enough, and to me where she feels like my always wanting &quot;to go above and beyond that which is asked of me&quot; is a boon. <br />
<br />
Not once in my life have I ever felt as conflicting a set of mixed emotions as this - and over something i'm not even passionate about! <br />
<br />
This has been one of the strangest weeks in my life, and I just don't know why I have to feel so shitty about this, yet I feel shitty about it, and I don't want to feel shitty about it. i want to sit down and teach my BiL what I have learned, but I feel like by doing so, I am breaking his very own soul.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Above and Beyond. Over the years I hear so many people tell me, &quot;don't do that, its not in your job description. you're not supposed to do that.&quot; Why the hell do we live in a society where Above and Beyond has become so shunned? Its as thoguh we are so far capitalistic that those paying the doers do not want to pay for additional skills and value in an employee, yet we are so socialist that we want everyone to work identically. <br />
<br />
WHAT THE FUCK?!</div>
