		<div>terrible news indeed.<br />
<br />
what a way to trash such a great system (spell ID) on raids.<br />
<br />
great so we get to see what a raid mob is casting via spell ID but can do nothing about it?<br />
<br />
<font color="Red"><b>Fixing spell counters on raids.</b></font><br />
<br />
<b>#1 all caster classes have spell counters (druid/necro/bm/sorc/psi)<br />
all of them can dismiss the spell being casted.<br />
<br />
#2 Place a spell ID counter # next to the spell being casted.  This would require multiple classes to counter the incomming spell.  Also require different types of spell ID counters.  Also redundant counters are not counted.  IE three druids cant spell counter by themselves, only 1 counter from 1 druid would count.<br />
<br />
#3 Make the cast times on the mob abilities really short like less than 2.0 seconds.<br />
<br />
Example #1<br />
Mob starts to cast nuke of devesation<br />
spell ID fires for any casters who catch it.<br />
1.5s cast time, and requires 4 spell counters to dismiss the nuke.</b><br />
<br />
--Since sorc have disperse/reflect and are more *anti caster/magic* only our 2 counters will count seperatly.  and the other 2 would need to be filled by two other caster classes, IE druid/nec/psi/bm<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<font color="Cyan"><b>Fixing wards for raid content.</b></font><br />
<br />
<font color="Cyan">#1 separate out raid mob abilities into two category's. </font><br />
-Mele ability<br />
-Spell ability<br />
<br />
<font color="Red"><b>Nulling ward </b></font>- dismisses 1 mele ability, the same target can not be affected by nulling ward for another XX seconds (30s 60s ...ect)<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b>Reflect ward </b></font>- reflects 1 spell ability, the same target can not be affected by reflect ward for another XX seconds (1min -2min - 5min ect)<br />
<br />
<font color="cyan">#2 Create a &quot;lesser&quot; version of each spell ability (IE 90% reduction 95% reduction across the board...ect)</font><br />
<br />
Then when a mob uses a spell ability and it gets reflected, it will hit for the &quot;lesser&quot; version back on the mob.<br />
<br />
<font color="cyan">#3 Allow chromantic barrier to reflect 1 spell ability every 60 seconds (its normal refresh)</font><br />
<br />
--this would give sorcer'ers the ability to ward themselves against an additional spell ability, in keeping with our anti magic theme.<br />
<br />
<font color="Cyan">#4 Fix Chromantic Halo to allow a reduction in the % of incomming spell damage</font><br />
<br />
--This can be anything you guys tune, 5%-10%, 15% ect.  This would be a permenant 60min buff that reduces incomming spell damage from ALL types by a set %.</div>

Nifty idea, but i really doubt they can pull that one off as implementation.<br />
And you can make custom tailored &quot;have-to-counter&quot; spells.<br />

Bah i liked the &quot;old wards&quot; but i think that any type of &quot;negation&quot; is useless.<br />
Ignoring 1 spell is just too powerfull, and if it stayed,<br />
It would lead to &quot;useless AE to strip the rune&quot; mechanic.<br />
The Per X second, i dont know, it limits it but...<br />
<br />
Thats why i thought about Spellshield &amp; Epic_Clicky, because if you took the<br />
time to refresh them, it was worth it. And it was just &quot;extra hp&quot; ...<br />
<br />
Which with CV eating your HP having a rune that will give you a &quot;buffer&quot; would help.<br />
<br />
Also if you left the &quot;runes&quot;, all mob key abilities, would have to &quot;ignore&quot; the runes.<br />
Because they would be useless_key_abilities otherwise or just keep recasting it.</div>

I dont play a cleric.  I also have never seen a 1 hour long group ward come from one of them.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about making our wards useful for raids.  <br />
<br />
Here's how I see them working out with the changes I've given.<br />
<br />
#1 we can give 1 AE avoid to our group within 10m vs mele abilities every XX seconds (devs can specify length)<br />
#2 we can give 1 AE avoid to our group within 10m vs spell abilities every XX seconds (devs can specify)<br />
<br />
This is a great comprimise to our wards for raid and group/solo, and the best part is mechanics to change it are already in place (lockout on recasting abilities in xx amount of time)<br />
<br />
<br />
To emilia, <br />
They can design around it like you suggested by making pulse ae's or by putting in a crap attack justbefore a big one, but then again we would be the only class capable of doing so, and then only within the limits they set.<br />
<br />
Hell it could be once per 5 min (once per fight)  we all know that AE's are generally timed / scripted and go off many times per fight  reducing one AE or attack or power drain, or raid debuff, is not that important in the grand scheme of things.</div>

last time I reflected a silence back at a mob it kept on casting nukes, that would have prolly been a few weeks back though.<br />
Maybe its reflect but it definately worked when it finished casting cause he nukes were AE physical (poison) dots and even whilts the mob had the silence icon on it still the AE was cast just fine.</div>

Dont missunderstand me, i love having two &quot;get out of jail&quot; cards for my group.<br />
But under their current form, they are just too powerfull.<br />
<br />
<u><i>If you make spell bypass the wards, you are making the entire mechanic useless for when it will matter the most.<br />
If you make &quot;junk spells&quot;, its because you cant balance the wards.</i></u><br />
<br />
Thats why Wizard spellshield (soaks spell X damage before fading) and <br />
Enchanter spellshield (reduces spell damage by Y) are a viable solution.<br />
You could even add a &quot;Self Only 1 Damage Rune&quot; like Staff of the Four.<br />
It will not prevent a dot/debuff, but it will soak/reduce/annul the 1st tick.<br />
<br />
I mean if Quarm's AE bypassed spellshield, there wouldnt be any reason for the spell to exist right ?<br />
<br />
And Vanguards SpellShield (Wards) are just way too powerfull.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its the exact problem with Dismiss/Reflect too powerfull to be used on &quot;bosses&quot;<br />
thus made useless when they are really needed.<br />
<br />
Anyone could stun a Froglok Guk Shaman to prevent it from casting CH/Gate.<br />
But when a raidboss like the SSRA High Priest decided to CH ... well tought luck !</div>

<br />
the point is you cant just re-cast it every 3 seconds, thats what makes it overpowered for raids.<br />
<br />
the fact that you can negate 1 or 2 ae, isn't overpowered at all, if you combine that with a re-use penalty, it allows for stratigic use of an ability.<br />
<br />
thats why they have the stipulation *can not be affected again for xx* seconds.<br />
<br />
I still dont see your point about it being overpowered.<br />
<br />
In EQ2 there were a lot of classes that had abilities that would avoid mobs AE's or any abilities that did not directly target them, and quite a few had group wide AE avoid's on re-use timers.<br />
<br />
it was in no way shape or form overpowered.  You could kill the mobs without said classes, and you could kill mobs with said classes with coordination a little easier.</div>

I decided to /petition, because I believe i'm bugged atm with over 30 updates and no spell.</div>

		<div>Grats, then the only thing left is they need to change it to something useful. I usually die with all reflects still up. I already thought it is major bugged because I did not see them trigger at all. But lately I was fixing my faction with the high elf and mass pulled Kaons. They used up half of the reflects. I would really be interested in how to put this spell to use (and nobody tells me as additional ward, if you would use the spell you would know the reflect does not trigger when you need it most).</div>
