Seeing that I had no car payment before my unfortunate collision with Rudolph and now I have a payment for the obvious reasons, Rudolph may be dead, but his punishment wasn't going to end there.  So, being the good country girl that I am, I took good ole dead Rudolph home, field dressed him by myself (there is a YouTube for everything!) because hubby, son and mom thought I was crazy and wanted no part of it.  The next morning I loaded him up in the back of my hubby's van (on plastic) and took him to the butcher.<br />
<br />
So now I have over 50 pounds of venison in my freezer.   Most of it in ground meat, 15 pounds of smokies, and the rest in roasts and steaks.   I had Rudolph tacos, and plan on making Rudolph Chili and Rudolph stew.  But, I need more ideas or recipes for how I can best enjoy the continued punishment of Rudolph.  <br />
<br />
Thoughts anyone?</div>
