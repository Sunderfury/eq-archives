			<div class="message">Do any of you realize how much money we spend on drug addicts and their semi legalized behavior?  They don't work.  They don't pay for anything.  They keep getting saved by the retarded narcan injections.  I have no problem legalizing everything the minute you make people pay for their lives and the minute you let them die when they fuck up.  But that's not what you want to do.  You want to create a doped up underclass that I and every non junkie pays for.  Fucking morons.</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I agree completely with this.  Freedom should come with personal responsibility.<br />
<br />
I think the &quot;semi-legalized&quot; part is just an enormously bad idea.  Either you go all-out legalize or you just crack down and go Singapore on users.  Personally I would prefer the latter (even if phased-in gradually with lots of rehab and warnings at the outset), I just think there's no way it's politically feasible in a democracy.<br />
<br />
My view is that the current situation where law enforcement and criminal penalties are overwhelmingly focused on sellers and traffickers is not working.  Police and courts can improve circumstances temporarily, and it can drive the problems to different jurisdictions, but there are no lasting improvements to the system as a whole.  Take down one cartel, another replaces it.  Clean up one neighborhood, slingers go to another neighborhood.  Take down one gang, their rivals are emboldened.  Take down that one, and cartels send in migrants.<br />
<br />
My position is that any serious attempt to solve the drug problem long term requires making a hard decision about what to do with the root of the problem:  the demand for illegal drugs.  Either get serious about reducing the demand with hardcore penalties for users; or accept defeat and make it legal.  Either build a dam that works, or don't.  But don't build a half-assed dam that doesn't work and then pay a bucket brigade endlessly carrying water back to the other side.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Drugs are usually expensive.  Stoners are probably paying $300/month to keep their habit.  Depending on where they're at in the abuser spectrum and their economic situation, they're possibly cutting corners somewhere else or stealing it.<br />
<br />
Here's 2 facts about drugs that get overlooked a lot, along with my opinion based on them on why this is an important fact<br />
1) Most Drugs can be dangerous on their own, but when you buy them on the street, they're often far more dangerous.  Cocaine cut with borax and lidocaine, marijuana grown with non-safe pesticides, MDMA that's really meth[1].  Most of the anti-drug propaganda uses facts about these unsafe versions of the drug to propagate why they need to remain illegal.  Moving them from felony to civil crimes (the cops take your drugs and destroy them, and give you a fine, to avoid the fine a judge may require you to go into rehab) could also allow better testing facilities.  Selling pure MDMA? The fine is $500/unit.  Selling MDMA cut with a dangerous substance?  Felony.<br />
<br />
2) Many, possibly most, of the recreational drugs are used for a reason.  Maybe it isn't a good reason, but outside of painkiller addictions, people don't start consuming drugs habitually because they HAVE to.  Watching shows on NatGeo or whatever you see it all the time.  Guy wants to buy marijuana, dealer says &quot;sorry, all out, but try this, it's just as good.&quot;  Next thing you know the user is doing meth.  And a lot of the time drug problems can be cured with other illegal drugs.  Heroin users replace heroin with opioids that don't last as long in the system, which means when they finally go through withdrawal, it's a lot faster.  Multiple small sample studies have shown that people who have ruined their lives through addiction can turn their life around after a single hallucinogen 'trip'.  Scientists should be able to test that kind of effect.  Maybe they need to register with the government or something so the government can make sure everyone just out of college isn't slapping &quot;scientist&quot; on their job title in order to sell drugs, but it's irrelevant. The war on drugs removing the ability of scientists to do science has done no one any favors.  While it's been a known use case among users for a while, scientists finally got to study Ketamine as an antidepressant.  Huge surprise, it works great.  And unlike most of the antidepressants on the market, you take it once, and while it might fuck you up for a few hours, then you're fine for multiple weeks.  As opposed to my friends who have been prescribed prescription antidepressants and become vaguely suicidal robots.<br />
<br />
When those of us that are against the War on Drugs say we want drugs decriminalized, we're not saying we want Meth stores on the corner. We're saying sending someone to prison where we pay $60,000 per year for them to be there gains us nothing. And treating drugs as if our categorization of them is magical doesn't help society ever.<br />
<br />
[1] I actually hear that 'real' meth (like they kind they 'used to' give soldiers) is just mentally addictive, and less so than lots of legal substances we don't even think of as drugs.  But my case still stands, replacing something not addictive with something addictive (even if only barely) is fucked up.</blockquote>

</div>Though this wasn't the angle I was thinking about when I created the thread, it is important to recognize what legalization would mean.  If not on a corner market, where would the recreational drugs and paraphernalia be sold?  If your plan doesn't actually address market demand, the black market won't go away.<br />
<br />
It seems likely to me that some of the reasons people use drugs are likely to conflict with the idea of going to a sterile and highly-regulated facility.  It's one thing to treat far-gone junkies, but they aren't the whole problem.  But people want use at parties, with their friends, in private, etc..  If you don't give them what they want someone else will.<br />

Also, if you legalize injected drugs, what happens to the HIV rate?</blockquote>

			Reducing the demand for drugs in the United States is the underlying theme that drives President Obama&#8217;s Strategy to reduce the shared threat of drug use and its consequences. By aggressively working to reduce U.S. drug consumption by preventing drug use before it begins and helping Americans suffering from addiction enter treatment, we not only improve public health and safety in the United States, but we also deprive violent Transnational Criminal Organizations of an important source of income.

The Obama Administration&#8217;s budgetary commitment to further reduce domestic drug use is real and significant. The President&#8217;s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/2011-national-drug-control-strategy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">National Drug Control Strategy</a> contains specific actions and targets to reduce drug use.  Last Fiscal Year (FY12) alone, the United States spent over $10 billion to support drug demand reduction programs, compared to $2.1 billion for international drug control programs.

			<b>Drug Legalization Will Not Eliminate Organized Crime</b><br />
<br />
Independent research has shown that legalizing marijuana would not dramatically reduce Mexican drug trafficking revenue.  In fact, the gross revenues to Mexican Transnational Criminal Organizations from illegal exports of marijuana to wholesalers in the United States are likely less than $2 billion.<br />
<br />
Transnational Criminal Organizations operating in Mexico do not derive revenue exclusively from drugs, nor would they disband if drugs were legalized.  They are increasingly diversified businesses, profiting off human trafficking, kidnapping, extortion, and intellectual property theft, etc.<br />
<br />
The brutal murder of 72 Central American immigrants by the Zeta Criminal Organization in Tamaulipas, Mexico, in 2010 had little to do with drug trafficking.  While there certainly is violence connected to drug trafficking and distribution, this violence expands to other arenas as these criminal organizations expand.<br />
<br />
Drug cartels will also find ways to profit even from regulated drug markets.  Sweden experimented with providing drugs through a state-regulated process in the 1960s.  Unsurprisingly, users soon began to divert drugs to others and often sold them on the black market.  During this period of permissive drug-use policies, drug use in Sweden began to rise.

</div>Drug abusers do have the power.  The extent to which they have the willpower to control their actions in any reasonable way is an open question, but from an economic perspective they are the primary source of wealth fueling the drug economy.  No demand for drugs, revenues will dry up.  No users, no dealers.  It's that simple.</blockquote>

</div>Yes.  It's manipulative, it's marketing, but it's not coercion.  It doesn't work on someone who isn't already open to the idea.<br />
<br />
More importantly, suppliers and dealers appear based on an individual assessment of risk vs reward.  Drug dealers choose to assume a great deal of risk (death, jail) for substantial rewards (money and power).  Knocking off dealers just increases the &quot;reward&quot; side of the equation for remaining dealers.  And if you manage to knock them all out, the reward proposition skyrockets until there's a man bold enough to assume the risks.  This increasingly selects for the most ruthless, corrupt, and dangerous kind of people.  So while fighting the dealers may help shrink the market somewhat by driving up prices, it's not as good a solution as thwarting the demand at the source: the users themselves.<br />
<br />
In the strictly economic sense, dealers do not have much meaningful control over the abusers.  They have some ability to stimulate demand and may exert all manner of incidental control over specific situations but broadly speaking, the dealers are salesman and users are their customers.  Salesman are always dependent on customers.</blockquote>
