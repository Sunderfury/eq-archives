		<div>I have been in Beta, but must confess that I haven't been very active, so I have one question for the Beta wizards, that have been more active than I.<br />
<br />
Can we solo aa's effectively at level 80?<br />
<br />
Any idea of the number of AA's, that can be soloed per hour at lvl 80?<br />
<br />
Are there zones with white/yellow trash (at 80), that we can solo?</div>

		<div>Soloing is easier than ever now that spell cast times are halved on big nukes. I didn't try all zones, but in most there is a lot of appropriate level trash mobs that can be rooted, snared and nuked to death. Don't even need to use instas on the run in most cases, especially with the new recast times on them. Can't say any particular camps yet because I didn't stop in one place and had no maps. Just went around all open zones and tried soloing, and it was easy in all of them.</div>

		<div>Sadly my time in beta was very limited this round due to rl obligations.  I got to log in like 6x in  all the months it was available to me, so like, not much :(  I baredly got to check nukes in the areana and never saw any of the zones or  killed anything in them, so no advance solo spots for me this time.  Hopefully we will find them quickly and be able to roll out the exp spots.</div>

If you ask me it was an exploit. there are 100's of players already lvl 80 so if you ask me sony better take another look at it.</div>

		<div>Yeah they were deleveling, poping their Lessons and then using their Vet AA to collect all corpses.. For some reason it was giving them insane amounts of EXP or something.... least thats what I understood of it.<br />

Either way its still an exploit and they should all be rolled back.</div>

		<div>There were two things going on:<br />
1) Several people saved up TONS of Ashengate Elite Insignias and turned them in when servers went live.  These items were giving a lot of exp (I heard 4 blue bubbles of AA exp) with each one...so the players doing this had saved up a LOT of these.   This has been nerfed with the first emergency patch.<br />
2) Expedient recovery was being used.  Players died down a couple levels and then placed themself in good experience groups to level back up.  Now they were level 75 and had a ton of corpses lying around.  There was a tiny frame of time they had since they couldn't allow their rez timers to expire.  Once SoF was live, expedient recovery.<br />
<br />
Neither of these players had any advantage over others necessarily.  #1 didn't get to turn in insignias for faction or experience like the rest of us already did. My alts turned in plenty of these things over the past year...they just benefitted from the experience then instead of now.  As for #2 well theres only a limited time frame that that can be done, they exp grinded that night instead of after SoF was live, and it can be risky if you don't time things well.</div>

		<div>As for the original question, soloing is very easy this time around.  While I didn't get a chance to do it extensively, I didn't ever encounter a place that I felt like I couldn't solo in.  We could never chain cast instant nukes while we soloed due to cloudburst's recourse so the same is true now only all of our regular nukes are now much easier to use while we solo.  <br />
<br />
As for locations...there are plenty.  Hills of Shade has some big skeletons with jack o lanterns wandering around that are kiteable.   I'm a little shaky with the other zone names but I found a nice raised area with a gate around it that was filled with skeletons that was really nice to kite.   I can't remember where it is but there was a big open area with a path in front of it...and the skeletons were casters so they were pretty easy.  Sorry I can't be of more help in the &quot;where&quot; department...but soloers will have plenty of places to go.</div>

		<div>Spots I've found<br />
<br />
<u>DragonScaleHills</u> - Umm pretty much everything there you can kite easily...the field with the wolves, crows etc isn't snareable but it's still easy. Brownies in the far SW seemed to be the best XP at nearly 1% per kill at 77.<br />
<br />
<u>Loping Plains</u> - Again TONS of places.  You can kite the crocs which are yellow about 1-1.5% per kill and easy.  Anything in the forest, bears, frogs etc.  The mino cave is great because of the spell drops there and the undead camp right next door is good too.  Also the goblin camp right near the SF zone in is very nice and has a named that drops decent stuff (but summons).  You can also kite the orcs outside the blood keep, they are fun etc nothing special there that I've found.<br />
<br />
<u>FM </u>- I forget the name of this zone lol, you take the slingshot there.  I just took a left from the zi, ran a bit found a safe spot and started kiting the mechs all around 2-4 at a time.  They seem to be a little less then 1% at 77 though, maybe because they are yellow and not blue?  Have more hps etc, so I don't think this is worth it until maybe higher levels then 77 if at all or grouped.</div>
