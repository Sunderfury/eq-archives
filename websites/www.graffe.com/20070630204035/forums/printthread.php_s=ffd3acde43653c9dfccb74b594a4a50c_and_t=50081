		<div>To generate a good arguement asto where wizards should be, DPS-wise, we need to be able to look at other DPS classes.<br />
<br />
How much support do they need, in terms of buffs and healing?  How important are those buffs?  How expensive are those buffs to the providers?<br />
<br />
How much support do wizards need, in terms of buffs and healing?  How important are those buffs?  How expensive are those buffs to the providers?<br />
<br />
We also need to be able to compare the game at multiple levels of power and multiple situations.  The easiest to define is &quot;top end&quot;, but &quot;top end single-group gear&quot; and &quot;bazaar geared with under 100 kpp in current gear and currently used spells&quot; might be other options to look at.<br />
<br />
Grouping, soloing and raiding.  Ideally we should look at melee-unfriendly raids, melee-friendly raids, and caster-unfriendly raids.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
So, let's look at buffs&amp;support first.<br />
<br />
Self buffs are what you can buff yourself.  Bottle buffs are buffs you can buy in the form of potions and/or clickies.  Passive buffs are buffs that a cheap per tick in both mana and casting/recast time of the buffer: everything from VOI to Wildskin.<br />
<br />
Active buffs are buffs that are expensive per tick in both mana and cast/recast time of the buffer.<br />
<br />
Auras are semi-Active, due to their group-only nature.  They require a significant resource from the buffer, namely being in your group.<br />
<br />
Passive melee buffs: Mammoth-line +% weapon damage, ranger ATK/DA/DW buffs, Haste, other ATK buffs.<br />
<br />
Passive caster buffs: VOI/DruidSkin/Kitty Crack/Cleric Haste/Mod Rods (sort of buff-like).<br />
<br />
Active melee buffs: Champion/Panther/Bard overhaste/Bard proc buff/epics<br />
<br />
Active caster buffs: Mana flare/Kitty Bomb/Bard spell damage buffs/epics/necro tap/SK tap<br />
<br />
Missing anything?<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The point of this is, once we have an idea of where wizards are and where they should be, we can propose changes and fixes with reems of data to back us up.</div>

		<div>Wizards for all intents and purposes are pure dps therefore should equate to zerkers and rogues (monks get in the dps area for some reason as well).<br />
<br />
To differentiate between melee and caster pure dps then wizards should be top at short but high dps and melees should be able to sustain dps when wizards are oom.<br />
<br />
Wizards should rise in the amount of dps that they can generate in a 3 minute window (3 minutes is an arbitary time).<br />
<br />
You really need to look at the type of dps ie over a period of time. Ie a necro should be equal to a rogue/zerker or even beat them over a period of time as a melee is more useful on multiple mobs whereas a necro needs a single or high hp mobs to shine.<br />
<br />
Mages are a halfway house, they have sustained dps via their pet and DS but have a decent burst ability as well.<br />
<br />
Druids have sustained via DS, decent burst, healing, buffs.<br />
<br />
Beasts have some buffs particulary paragon line but seem to have suffered on the dps stakes laterly. They do have the benefit of being able to slow.<br />
<br />
Bards are pretty well balanced imo, limited dps, lots of tricks and boost a group nicely.<br />
<br />
Warriors are well warriors, dps might be a touch too high imo but they do a needed role but very single dimension.<br />
<br />
Pally and SK's both seem pretty balanced and do their role well. Most you can argue is that there is less reason for a warrior in a pickup group that is xping.<br />
<br />
Cleric - well healing and buffing. Tend to be very group dependant but anyone that plays a good cleric get my vote. Balanced imo, very sought after in general but once again very single dimensional.<br />
<br />
Enchanter - buffs and limelight sometimes. Shame they didnt develop enchanters ability more but seemed to want to knock them down from when they used to be Gods.<br />
<br />
Not sure if I have forgotten a class but if I had then its cause you cant be that useful :p</div>

		<div>What the classes bring to the table other than damage can be looked at elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I'm just interested in how much damage the classes do, and what it takes to support them from other people to do that damage.<br />
<br />
Looking at it naively, it seems that there is a problem getting caster DPS support into caster groups, and that active melee support kicks the crap out of active caster support.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, on raids melee can need more resources to keep alive <b>on some events</b> (AOE rampage events).<br />
<br />
<b>Active melee buffs</b>: Champion/Panther/Bard overhaste/Bard proc buff/epics<br />
<br />
Bard overhaste and Melee proc buffs work well together, and require a melee-heavy group.  Plus bards do their best damage when they are near the mob.  This means that bards will tend to be placed near the mob in a melee-heavy group.  Note that the bard's melee buffage also buffs themselves, a nice bit of leverage.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Quote:</div>
	<table cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td class="alt2">
			<hr />
			
				Active caster buffs: Mana flare/Kitty Bomb/Bard spell damage buffs/epics/necro tap/SK tap
			
			<hr />
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>
<br />
All kinds of mana regen buffage can be redirected to healers.  The Kitty Bomb/SK tap are both mostly-melee classes granting some small amounts of power to a caster.<br />
<br />
Bard spell damage songs don't stack well with wizard familiars.  The newer ones are better at it.  But the Bard doesn't have the double-punch effect on wizards that it has on melee.  This makes putting a Bard in a wizard group inefficient compared to a melee group.<br />
<br />
There really isn't an &quot;in group caster-heavy epic click&quot; out there.  The benefit of the druid's click gets spread randomly over the raid, and can easily be consumed by hybrid spells and the like.<br />
<br />
Champion damn good, boosting melee damage by almost 10%.  It scales with gear indefinately, stacks discs/crits.  It also pairs up with Panther, which is a good reason to have a shaman buffing &amp; healing a melee group.<br />
<br />
To compare with the power of Champion+Shaman Epic+Panther, imagine if Druids could cast a spell that granted the group +75% damage on spell crits, a group mana flare, and their epic granted thier group +6.5% nuke crit chance and +110% nuke crits.<br />
<br />
Basically, it could simply be a matter of &quot;there aren't enough wizard nuke boosting abilities in the game, and enough reasons to place the classes that boost wizard nukes into wizard groups.&quot;</div>

		<div>i'll tell you why its a bad idea to depend more on buffs.<br />
we depend enough on that crap enough already.  as much attention we require with debuffs i think that should really be enough! mr wasn't adding anywere close as much damage as panther or bards either but it too was nerfed. melees in a way are partly balanced on needing those buffs too since they dont use mana , so in a way they cost other classes more mana and resources to keep around.<br />
<br />
i think our balance shoud be coming more from gear, spells and aa.</div>

TSS came out 7 months ago.  Why do people still believe/perpetuate that old information.  It is the bard aura that does not stack with our familiars.  Their new songs do stack amazingly well with our familiars.<br />
<br />
With my current focuses, chaining Cold Snap 2 / Cloudburst Strike 2, I do 2399 DPS.  Putting a bard in the group singing Chillsong Aria 2, it goes up to 2514 DPS.  Add Arcane Aria too, and it goes to 2608.<br />
<br />
Chaining Chaos Immolation 2, I get 645 DPS.  Adding a bard singing Pyrotechnics 2 and Arcane Aria, it goes to 787 DPS.<br />
<br />
Also:  Don't forget all the other classes we need to achieve our DPS potential:  One bard singing HOS, another with Chaos Chant, an enchanter with Tash, a druid with their debuffs, a necro with their debuffs, a magician or shaman with mayonaise.  Who did I forget?<br />
<br />
Oh, have the Harry Potter wands been mentioned yet?  I like those.<br />

befor tbs a bard's dd song would would Double a wizards gorm rate but in nerfing manaflare procs with panther it also killed the Gorm procs from those type of procs too. <br />
<br />
one thing that might help imo is making some bard spell lines AE since guilds tend to stick them with the 10 rogues they have.</div>
