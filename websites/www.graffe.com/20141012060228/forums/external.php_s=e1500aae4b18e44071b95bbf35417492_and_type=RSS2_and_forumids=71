			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Just in case anyone wants to get a decent idea of how the Oculus Rift looks and whether you should buy it, I present you with this:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://vr.mkeblx.net/oculus-sim/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://vr.mkeblx.net/oculus-sim/</a><br />
<br />
Check the &quot;Low Persistence&quot; box, and select different resolutions, while holding your face ~3&quot; away.<br />
<br />
You'll basically see something like this: <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/pllSQFKF1k8/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://i.ytimg.com/vi/pllSQFKF1k8/maxresdefault.jpg</a><br />
<br />
The Dev Kit 2 is 1080p, and the Crescent Bay Prototype they've been playing with is the 1440p version labeled CV1, and I haven't played with that one, but I hear the screen door problem is gone, the only problem is that you can see the color shift from the subpixels (meaning instead of seeing white, you see a 'rainbow' effect of red, blue, green. <br />
<br />
Playing around with the slider, you can kind of see how the CV1 prototype looks pretty good, but still has some problems.  But the other issue the CV1 fixes that I haven't been able to play with is the refresh rate.<br />
<br />
Tearing on your monitor is a little awful, but tearing on the Rift can make you sick incredibly fast.  Oculus says they're aiming for a minimum of a 90hz refresh.  DK2 has a 75hz refresh, and on simulator style games that seems adequate. I didn't get sick playing Euro Truck Simulator.  But on action games?  I played Windlands for ~30-45 minutes.  When I finished, I thought the nasty cold/sinus infection I'd been fighting for a week had come back, as I was sweating, and felt nauseous. After a few minutes for having the Rift off of my face, I realized for the second time in my life, I had become motion sick.  To be sort of fair to everyone involved, I was doing stupid things.  I was &quot;swinging&quot; on a tree at high enough velocities that I launching myself up into the air several hundred feet to grab other trees.  They have some different options for targeting your grappling hooks, which may be required for anyone playing it for extended periods.<br />
<br />
Playing Euro Truck Simulator with the Rift on was fun. I don't think I would ever play that game without a Rift, but playing with the Rift was pretty awesome. being able to look at an angle to view your mirror and still see the road in front of you is a lot more natural than using key bindings or mouse look to angle a different way.<br />
<br />
Also, I have awful vision (about -9x in both eyes) and wear contacts. I was worried I wouldn't be able to use a Rift with it so close to my face, or if I did that I might have to remove my contacts, but I ultimately didn't have a problem with that.  It worked fine without removing my contacts, or making adjustments from my friend who was using his glasses.</div>

			If you're still holding out hope for Kickstarter as the new face of funding video game development, you may want to revise that projection. Analyst group ICO Partners has been tracking Kickstarter through 2014 and has observed a marked drop in successful projects, funds pledged, and overall scale of projects on the site. Based on projections, the group expects a 20% drop in successful projects by the end of the year -- not a collapse, but a definite shrink.<br />
<br />
 The downturn is attributed to a variety of factors, including the lack of several big-name projects to draw people to the service and a number of high-profile failures. ICO Partners analyst Thomas Bidaux also notes that the amount being received by successful projects is diminishing, which he attributes to fans being less willing to drop money on a potential game when some of their already funded games have yet to materialize. The full report has more data and is well worth a read for anyone interested in crowdfunding and its future.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>October is traditionally one of the months with the highest volume of new games, so bear with me as I attempt to highlight a few dozen things you might want to know about. The biggest game this month was going to be Assassin's Creed, but it apparently got delayed to November, which leaves us without an obvious heavyweight this month. <br />
<br />
I guess the first thing I will mention is <b>Alien: Isolation</b>. They promise they are doing it right this time. I don't know if the game will be good, but at the very least, they are making it about a single Alien that you cannot kill and have to escape from. Like Borderlands? There's more <b>Borderlands</b>, in <b>The Pre-Sequel</b>. Play as characters aligned with Handsome Jack from Borderlands 2 before he went evil and bounce around on the moon. Note that this is made by another studio as Gearbox presumably works on Borderlands 3.<br />
<br />
If you are up for something spooky this month, <b>The Evil Within</b> might be up your alley. This is the survival horror that is supposed to bring survival horror back, as opposed to the action games all the others have become lately. Maybe you want to tone down the scares but still want a Halloween themed game to enjoy this month? <b>Costume Quest 2</b> is also due this month. This is the cartoony rpg from Double Fine in which you play as kids trick or treating. <br />
<br />
The PC is getting <b>Civilization: Beyond Earth</b>, as well as a port of the Xone's <b>Ryse</b> (apparently), and <b>Final Fantasy 13</b>. Apparently Square is planning on releasing FF13-2 and FF13-3 on PC too, so all you PC gamers can be in just as much agony as the rest of us! Seriously though, they are launching it at $15, which is amazing for various reasons, and probably a litmus test for whether or not they will bother porting FF15 to PC.<br />
<br />
The Xone has a good month for exclusives, with <b>Project Overdrive</b> leading the charge. This is the kind of silly third person shooter from the Ratchet and Clank guys. The Kinect game based on <b>Fantasia</b> and made by the Dance Central guys is also due soon. The PS4's big exclusive this month is <b>Driveclub</b>. The Wii U meanwhile gets <b>Bayonetta 2</b>. <br />
<br />
On handhelds, the 3DS gets its version of <b>Smash Bros</b> as well as <b>Fantasy Life</b>, an rpg from Level 5 (Ni No Kuni). The Vita is finally getting <b>Freedom Wars</b>, that monster hunter looking game I posted about a long time ago with the sci-fi anime theme of having to fight monsters to pay off a prison sentence.<br />
<br />
That's not all, be sure to check the spoiler for the complete list, and share anything I missed.<br />
