My wife has serious health problems and I asked her a few years back to stop working as her health was suffering. About once a week I walk about 6 miles home from work.  The hour is certainly odd but I don't live in an area where I fear for my safety and its healthy and clears my head. <br />

Regularly the local police harass me for no particular reason.  I have no record of any kind.  As in not even a ticket...ever.  I do not look like a gangster or a criminal.   <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=1888"  title="Name:

I have been threatened, I have been disrespected, I have been asked to show a baggy in my pocket because all the hip drug dealers keep their stash in jack links teriyaki bags because that tangy flavor smokes so damn smooth.  I have been told they were concerned for my safety because I didn't have a coat. I have been questioned repeatedly, patted down with my hands on the freaking car, had my nonexistent record run repeatedly at their convenience.   I have been threatened with arrest not once but twice while helping someone more their property from their apartment.  Once made to wait an hour because they wanted to verify that the resident who had committed the grievous sin of being born with dark skin wasn't robbing the place despite his id showing residence and his mail being in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
As I was leaving the latest shakedown I used the f word while turning to walk away.  I was subsequently arrested for public disorderly conduct based entirely on the content of my speech.  It is illegal in the state of South Carolina to use profanity on the public road.   Yes really.  The officer assured me it was the content of my speech which was illegal.  Further that &quot;The first amendment doesn't mean you can say whatever you want.&quot;  Her further cited the fact that an employer can fire you for making racist statements as an example that free speech doesn't guarantee well free speech.  The distinction between a private employment agreement and the law of the land was entirely lost on him unfortunately because apparently we don't teach that in the south.<br />
<br />
So I was kidnapped and tossed in with a bunch of drug addicts and drunks including one fellow who got arrested for being drunk in his own back yard and hadn't been able to reach anyone on the phone for 3 days.  He spent the entire time crumpling his paperwork and smoothing it out.  Not the most exciting social environment there.<br />
<br />
I was unable to contact anyone for like 8 hours.  I told the cops there that I needed to call my wife because if I disappeared in the middle of the night she would think I was dead.  I got... laughter.  Then one of the dicks came over and I thought he was going to give me my phone call unfortunately he had just realized by watching me waving that he had forgotten to confiscate my wedding ring... Gee thanks asshole.  Not only this but when my wife started calling ERs and police stations she was lied to and told I wasn't there.<br />
<br />
When I got out of web cam court, yes really, I was given my cell phone and could finally reach her.  She had spent the entire morning crying thinking I was dead.<br />
<br />
Now I have to deal with a court case in which I face a $270 fine that I can pay but would really like to put towards something like a FUCKING bill and a threat of prosecuting me for having in my possession a entirely legal prescription drug based on the fact that I chose to carry a single pill in a key chain container from a local pharmacy rather than strolling around with the entire bottle.<br />
<br />
I fucking love living in the land of the free and the home of the brave.  Is fucking cursing on the fucking internet fucking illegal yet?</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">The cops are just a gang. The sooner you recognize this and take steps to limit any and all interactions with them, the better off you will be. Sometime around your 33'rd birthday, they will lose interest in you, begin deferring to you, calling you &quot;sir&quot; and so forth. In the meantime, they are just doing what the know they can get away with.<br />
<br />
I am sorry you went through that. In a moral world, cops who lie about your status when frantic family members call looking for their loved ones would be run out of town on a rail. They wouldn't be able to rent or buy anywhere, and they would be treated like the gangster scum they emulate.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not -- there are good cops out there, but it doesn't sound like there are very many in your town. My condolences.</blockquote>

Raleigh was rife with shocking amounts of racism and misogyny. Out in the open.<br />
<br />
Everywhere I've been in both states was an absolute social nightmare that honestly made me consider getting out of the IT industry entirely because my job was enabling fuckwads like that to live well and not only perpetuate their absolutely horrifying behavior, but foster it in others.<br />
<br />
I don't know if south carolina qualifies as appalachian, but that whole area, everywhere I've been from the virginias to tennessee to florida, despicable behavior is fostered moreso than anywhere else I've ever been.<br />
<br />
From racism and misogyny to incest, child abuse, and rampant pursuit of big screen televisions instead of indoor plumbing.<br />
<br />
As a sheltered midwestern white kid, the area in general was quite a shock.<br />
<br />
To this day, I still chafe and brace myself when someone is a white male and has a southern accent because I know, as a middle class white man, they're going to open up to me and tell me things that make me want to end their lives for the good of the world as a whole.</blockquote>

</div>I was in far western virginia in the 90's and saw this multiple times.<br />
For most of the year people were living off of whatever they had in their garden and basically nothing else, and many houses without indoor plumbing in this rural area had new pick-up trucks and large (for the time) screen televisions.<br />
I'm not saying it's like that everywhere, but it was truly there and it was true in more than half of the homes I visited on that trip (about 20).</blockquote>

</div>I don't know.  It seems plausible though.  The extent of my experience with school bus routes/school district delineation is an episode of Friday Night Lights.</blockquote>

I would've gone in a rage and probably waited somewhere and kill a pig by shooting him in the back then taking my own life ! But then again I don't have kids and a loving wife. That is complete crap there must be a high crime rate or something that's making them frisk people like that. I would've hired an attorney or filed a complaint with the department of justice or some organization if the mayor's office is ignoring you. I would say that's bullshit but seeing all the crap you went through , I would have to say that's insane. I'd go that route!</blockquote>

</div>Well it's better living and taking shit from everyone. People are so fucking stupid. You seriously want to live not being able to walk the street free? It seems that's what your fuckign sarcastic comment meant! Fucking tell me how you change the world so it's not unfair and wrong. It is fucking impossible unless you are the president. So unless you think I can run for president and change the world and do it less than 4 years (people are fucking stupid because how the fuck did we get obama in the office and only end up with some neo nazi ready to destroy the working class) try understand that maybe giving up and going out with a bang is probably the closest thing we can come to justice. Fucking think you are so wise when you have power over fucking nothing and you just take it every single fucking day it makes me sick. No wonder shit like this happens, its because of how weak and brainwashed we are and you are a perfect example of that.</blockquote>
