When I left Icefall Glade was good for my level, but I was curious to know where the good places are now.  If I missed a thread about this please just link it to me!<br />

Thanks a ton - it feels good to be back.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Nodyin-Dev is requesting AA Wishlists 2009,<br />
<br />
<b>Final Week please help me sort by High/Med/Low Demand</b><br />
<br />
so please post your wishlist here and will compile them for dev's<br />
(Either I will Compile or someone else will Since I am not a Wizard just getting things started)<br />
<br />
<b>Compiled List<br />
This includes stuff from Graffe and EQForums<br />
High Demand</b><br />
&#8226;	Prismatic Familiar = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:01:00 Requirements: Level 65, 67, 72, 77, 82), E&#8217;ci&#8217;s Icy Familiar, Druzzil&#8217;s Mystical Familiar, Ro&#8217;s Flaming Familiar at Level 1, (2, 3, 4, 5). This ability allows you to combine your familiars into a single Prismatic Familiar that strengthens the effects of your fire, cold, and magic-based spells. Additional ranks allows the familiar to strengthen higher level spells.<br />
&#8226;	Sorcerer&#8217;s Impenetrable Shielding = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:30:00 Requirements: Level 85, No previous ability requirements. This ability creates a temporary shield around the caster that negates all spell damage for the duration, including from the caster himself. (Caster is silenced). <br />
Rank 1 &#8211; 24 second duration <br />
Rank 2 &#8211; 30 second duration <br />
Rank 3 &#8211; 36 second duration<br />
&#8226;	Spell Casting Mastery = Create 5 more Levels at 2% each, or 10 ranks at 1% each.<br />
&#8226;	Hastened Destruction = Cut reuse time of Prolonged Destruction<br />
&#8226;	Mass Travel = Turn's the next Translocate spell you cast into a Mass AE to that location, at the expense of quadrupling the mana cost.  30 Minute re-use timer... or the standard 1 hour 12 minutes with an AA line to hasten it down by 50pct would be acceptable<br />
&#8226;	Last Word (aka The Corbomite Maneuver) = This is a passive ability; it does not need to be activated.  Requirements: Level: 59, (65, 70, 71, 73, 75, 76, 78, 80, 81, 83, 85), Mana Burn, Mana Blast, Mana Blaze, Volatile Mana Blaze, at Level 1, (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) This ability allows you to speak one Last Word of defiance before your untimely demise, releasing your mana reserves in one final show of force. Additional ranks increase the likelihood of this event. (Basically it triggers a Mana Burn/Blast/Blaze proc upon death. It is subject to the same restrictions as Manaburn including the timer between Manaburns to prevent Wizard suicide groups lol). Rank 1 &#8211; 5%. Rank 2 &#8211; 10%. Rank 3 &#8211; 15%. Rank 4 &#8211; 20%. Rank 5 &#8211; 25%. Rank 6 &#8211; 30%. Rank 7 &#8211; 35%. Rank 8 &#8211; 40%. Rank 9 &#8211; 45%. Rank 10 &#8211; 50%. Rank 11 &#8211; 55%. Rank 12 &#8211; 60%.<br />
&#8226;	Shared Harvest = This ability will allow your group members to benefit from your Improved Harvest of Druzzil<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Mid Demand</b><br />
&#8226;	Arcane Wormhole = A wizard's study of the underlying principles of Teleportation magic allows them to open a brief hole in reality between them and an ally, summoning the targeted player to you.  Due to the experimental nature of this magic, this process has a chance of sapping strength from you... making you more susceptible to melee damage for 1 minute.  Reusable every 5 minutes<br />
&#8226;	Harvest Mastery = gives a 10% chance to &quot;crit&quot; your harvests, doubling the mana returned<br />
&#8226;	Destructive Efficiency = Through prolonged training both physically and mentally, you are able to enter into a destructive frenzy with a reduction to the mana cost penalty.  Each rank reduces the extra mana cost by 20%.  5 ranks for 100% reduction of mana penalties associated with Destructive Frenzy<br />
&#8226;	Arcane Spell Casting Mastery = This ability will lower the percentage of mana consumed on a spell fizzle. Each rank lowers your consumed fizzle mana by 10 percent. 5 Ranks<br />
&#8226;	Defiant Conservation =  Instense mental training allows the wizard a chance to recall a portion of the spent mana on a resisted spell blast.  First rank gives a 10% chance to recall 10% of the spent mana.  Second rank a 25% chance to recall 25%. The third rank gives a 50% chance to recover 50% of the spent mana<br />
&#8226;	Twincast = This AA just needs modifying period actually.  The pure casters should have higher than 3pct base chance to twincast.  Wizards should have the highest modifier as ALL we do is nuke... mages should be slightly lower (but not alot lower)... then druids and other casters... but NONE of the casting classes should only have 3 pct for 21AA's<br />
&#8226;	Manaburn - I like the proposed changes... however judging from that info, top raiding wizard's will be outputting 450K in a single blast.  Call me crazy but somehow I seriously doubt the devs will ever allow that with todays mana resupply abilities.  For this reason... I propose the damage output be only raised to 5:1 with no cap of mana used.  You have 25K mana you manaburn all 25k into 125K damage.  This would also not need coding changes for more time in between Manaburns... or formulas for mob hp needing to be high enough and so on.  In a single Twincast I can do around 120K and that won't kill a named outright... upper zones I have to do that 3-4 times.  So wizard group ganking isn't likely as they have to survive a full minute to do it again and they could just as easily twincast and kill it faster.  However... to supplement this and make it more useable, please read on...<br />
&#8226;	Ethereal Channeling = Wizards are, from a young age, able to feel mana in the world all around them.  Experienced Wizards learn to tap into streams of that mana in order to replenish their own magical energies.  But the the most devout practicioners of sorcery are able to submerge themselves in the flow of mana completely, using the ambient mana to fuel their most draining magical attacks while conserving their own power.  Training in this AA will permanently modify your Volitale Mana Blaze to cost no mana and to cast rapidly.  Your damage output will still depend on your current mana stores however.<br />
&#8226;	Ward of Destruction = Change to a Circle of Power Ranks I-*V, or I-III (with the later ranks increasing duration) type aura. Reduce base duration to compensate.<br />
&#8226;	Mana Burn = Change to 10:1 ratio, set a restriction: mob hp must be 1.5x the amount of damage. (IE: Wizard has 20k mana (200k damage), mob must have minimum 300k base HP.) Increase the timer to 5 minutes between mana burns. Make the ranks scale better with mana pools as well. A grouping only wizard can now reach 30k+ mana with max level VMB capped at 20k. Raid Wizards are 40k and will likely see 45k+ once fully Tower geared.<br />
&#8226;	Force of Will = Increase the damage or give us a lot more ranks or both. This AA is anemic at best. We have clicky nukes from 5 years ago that are better than this. We should be on Level 9 or 12 of this line by now with an increase of 500 damage per level. With a 20 second recast a 4.5k DD (rank 9x500) equates to 220dps which is hardly overpowering now in the days of 3-4k sustained dps.<br />
&#8226;	Mnemonic Retention = Create 2 more Levels (since we were supposed to get 1 with SoD).<br />
&#8226;	Quick Damage = Create 5 more Levels at 2% each, or 10 ranks at 1% each<br />
&#8226;	Tertiary Recall = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:10:00 (Same recast timer as Secondary Recall). Requirements: Level: 71, Secondary Recall at Level 1.Use of this ability allows you to quickly gate yourself back to a tertiary bind point that has been previously set by use of a *Stone of Etching.<br />
&#8226;	Secondary Teleport Bind = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:5:00 (Same recast timer as Teleport Bind). Requirements: Level: 74, Secondary Recall, Teleport Bind at Level When activated, this ability will teleport the wizard&#8217;s entire group to the wizard&#8217;s secondary bind point that has been previously set by use of a Stone of Marking.<br />
&#8226;	Tertiary Teleport Bind = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:5:00 (Same recast timer as Teleport Bind and Secondary Teleport Bind). Requirements: Level: 79, Tertiary Recall, Secondary Teleport Bind at Level 1. When activated, this ability will teleport the wizard&#8217;s entire group to the wizard&#8217;s tertiary bind point that has been previously set by use of a *Stone of Etching.<br />
&#8226;	Translocate Bind. = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:5:00 Requirements: Level: 69, Teleport Bind at Level 1. When activated, this ability will teleport the wizard&#8217;s target to the wizard&#8217;s primary bind point.<br />
&#8226;	Translocate = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:00:05 Requirements: Level: 55, No previous ability requirements. This ability grants you a form of your Translocate spell.<br />
&#8226;	Teleport = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:00:05 Requirements: Level: 65, Translocate at Level 1. This ability grants you a form of your Teleport spell.<br />
&#8226;	Teleportation Mastery =  This is a passive ability; it does not need to be activated. Requirements: Level 51, (56, 61, 66, 71, 76, 81), No previous ability requirements.This ability makes it impossible for your portals to collapse up to a certain level. Rank 1 &#8211; level 10. Rank 2 &#8211; level 20. Rank 3 &#8211; level 30. Rank 4 &#8211; level 40. Rank 5 &#8211; level 50. Rank 6 &#8211; level 60. Rank 7 &#8211; level 70.<br />
&#8226;	Abscond = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:00:05 Requirements: Level 55, No previous ability requirements. This ability grants you a form of your abscond spell.<br />
&#8226;	Mass Translocation = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 1:12:00 Requirements: Level 70, Teleport at Level 1. This ability turns the next translocation spell that you cast into a beneficial area of effect spell, hitting everyone within its radius, at the cost of quadrupling the spell&#8217;s mana usage.<br />
&#8226;	Fickle Harvest = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 1:12:00 Requirements: Level 75, (80, 85), Harvest of Druzzil at Level 3. This ability allows you to draw mana from your surroundings; however your lack of focus may prevent you from achieving its full effects. Additional ranks increase the maximum amount that may be restored. (Restores a random amount of mana based on rank). Rank 1 &#8211; 20%. Rank 2 &#8211; 35%. Rank 3 &#8211; 50%.<br />
&#8226;	Wild Harvest = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 1:12:00 Requirements: Level 75, (80, 85), Arcane Harvest at Level 1, (2, 3). This ability allows you to draw mana from your surroundings without heed to its quality; however your undo haste may allow the mana to become contaminated, degrading its usefulness. Additional ranks increase the amount that may be restored. (Greatly restores mana but procs a debuff that reduces spell damage). <br />
Rank 1: Restore 25% mana, reduces spell damage by 50% for 2 minutes <br />
Rank 2: Restore 50% mana, reduces spell damage by 50% for 4 minutes <br />
Rank 3: Restore 100% mana, reduces spell damage by 50% for 8 minutes<br />
&#8226;	Arcane Weakness = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 0:30:00 Requirements: Level 85, Focus Arcanum. This ability allows you to create a temporary Arcane Weakness around your target, causing all your spells to strike with near perfect accuracy. Additional ranks increase the duration of this effect. (Gives a buff that causes all nukes to become unresistable [or have a -1000 check, or if neither of those are possible, debuffs the mob for -1000 to all resists]) Rank 1 &#8211; 24 seconds. Rank 2 &#8211; 42 seconds. Rank 3 &#8211; 60 seconds.<br />
&#8226;	Spell Casting Excellence =  This is a passive ability; it does not need to be activated. Requirements: Level: (Same level as required by equivalent levels of SCE or MotP), Spell Casting Expertise at Level 3, Mastery of the Past at Level 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 Those who learn from failure are less apt to fail again. This ability reduces the amount of mana lost due to fizzling by 25%. Additional ranks increase the level of spells affected. Rank 1 &#8211; 53. Rank 2 &#8211; 57. Rank 3 &#8211; 61. Rank 4 &#8211; 65. Rank 5 &#8211; 69. Rank 6 &#8211; 73. Rank 7 &#8211; 77. Rank 8 &#8211; 81. Rank 9 &#8211; 85.<br />
&#8226;	Cascading Destruction = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 1:12:00 Requirements: Level: 85, Prolonged Destruction at Level 2, 4, 6. While active this ability allows you to cause a Cascade reaction, whereby each successive spell with a cast time &gt; 1 builds upon the last causing more damage. (IE spell damage increases the more spells you cast).<br />
Rank 1 &#8211; 24 seconds, 10% power increase per spell<br />
Rank 2 &#8211; 36 seconds, 10% power increase per spell<br />
Rank 3 &#8211; 42 seconds, 10% power increase per spell<br />
&#8226;	I liked a few other AAs, one that can cross all classes.  Use 2 spires at once.<br />
&#8226;	I'd like an AA that lets me detonate my familiar for an AE bomb/snare/debuff.<br />
&#8226;	I'd like an AA Stun.I'd like a vertical netherstep type deal.<br />
&#8226;	I'd like an AA that steals group members mana or an AA that is like Divine Arbitration just for mana <br />
&#8226;	I'd like an AA that powers up my groups spells.<br />
&#8226;	I'd like an AA that siphons hps for mana.<br />
&#8226;	I'd like an AA that is a Forced AA Rejuvenation.<br />
&#8226;	AAs to reduce the reuse time on Teleport Bind<br />
&#8226;	AAs to reduce the reuse time on Secondary Recall<br />
&#8226;	AA to give a group version of Secondary Recall<br />
&#8226;	AA to (preferably) eliminate the chance of an unstable gate for any one I'm porting or TLing.<br />
&#8226;	AA to modify Arcane Overkill to also work on crits. I don't want to get into a race on getting the kill shot just for a chance to recover some mana. Adding the chance when I also score a crit would be so much better<br />
&#8226;	mirror image- instant cast = summons 3 clones of the caster, each taking 1/3 of the casters aggro and adds it to theirs. they also nukes <br />
&#8226;	ice nova- 30 sec cool down <br />
&#8226;	instant cast ae root <br />
&#8226;	nether step- free up a spell gem <br />
&#8226;	Living bomb- 4 tick dot, at the end huge ae explosion <br />
&#8226;	blast wave- pbae that pushes the mobs back a good distance <br />
&#8226;	icy viens- spell haste increased by 20% (over cap too) for 20 sec, 4.5 min reuse <br />
&#8226;	water elemental!- ice nuker pet that stays out about 20 sec witha 3 min reuse. <br />
&#8226;	icy barrier- good ice rune worth a darn. this game would start letting runes scale with hp or something. <br />
&#8226;	Invisible- fades if it, 3 min reuse,2 sec doom buff - turns the caster invisible and clears their aggro. would let it clear ooc timer to 30 sec too.<br />
 <br />
<b>Low Demand</b><br />
&#8226;	Wild Harvest = Type: Activated, Refresh Time 1:12:00 Requirements: Level 75, (80, 85), Arcane Harvest at Level 1, (2, 3). This ability allows you to draw mana from your surroundings without heed to its quality; however your undo haste may allow the mana to become contaminated, degrading its usefulness. Additional ranks increase the amount that may be restored. (Greatly restores mana but procs a debuff that reduces spell damage). <br />

Rank 2: Restore 50% mana, reduces spell damage by 50% for 4 minutes <br />
Rank 3: Restore 100% mana, reduces spell damage by 50% for 8 minutes</div>
