				And no word on when it will actually arrive. In an interview with VideoGamer.com, Nour Polloni of developer Eden Games says the game is &quot;not performing as well on PS3 as we hope it is in terms of frame rate,&quot; and they're holding back the title in order to give PS3 players their money's worth.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't want it to come out and have less of an experience for the PS3 gamer,&quot; Polloni said. &quot;We wanted to tweak that up and make sure they get the best experience on PS3 as much as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alone in the Dark for PS3 will be the same content as the 360 and PC versions but will still be &quot;worth the wait.&quot; Those two consoles plus the PS2 and Wii versions will drop on June 24.<br />
<br />
And, interestingly, he got real cagey about multiplayer possibilities in this franchise.<br />
<br />
I won't try to paraphrase because I don't know what the guy is/not committing to, and it wasn't my interview. But it was a great question from VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole, and it sounds like if Eden and Atari have plans for multiplayer, it's contingent on too many things right now.

</div>This really pisses me off.  My PS3 kicks off higher res and has better sound than the 360.  (No one in their right mind would buy a crappy res Wii version anyway).</div>

It looks like a watered down version of the Matrix, but at least Hollywood is trying. True art will come back one day I'm sure, until then we must settle for Wanted! I hear the comic was better, has anyone read it?<br />

What are your thought's anyone else looking forward to this one for the summer season? What other movie trailers have you seen that look like they will be blockbusters.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>There was a lot of interest in doing an online 4th edition campaign when I asked a couple months ago. However, the only players who have confirmed they're interested and started making a character are Mdar, and a friend of mine from outside the boards.<br />
<br />
I need at least 2 more players for the campaign to really work out the way I'd like. I'm open to more than that, but it doesn't seem likely that I'll get the interest. I'm likely going to run on Wednesday nights, but depending on the schedules of others I can move the day. As of now I'm planning on starting as early as <b><font color="Red">10 days</font></b> from now. So I need to hear from people who want to play ASAP.<br />
<br />
So this is the last call for the campaign. I was hoping more of the interested parties would contact me by now.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>My wife is learning to drive and as yet she hasn't worked up the courage to drive on busy roads, so I want to let her get behind the wheel of some virtual cars first. We have been driving around deserted industrial estates so far so she knows how to handle the vehicle.<br />
 <br />
 I'm looking for driving simulator software that can give her experience of driving under busy conditions. Racers and GTA probably don't count here. <br />
 <br />
 Ideally I want software written for the UK that requires following the Highway Code. I'd jump for joy if it has any kind of AI that will allow the traffic to react to her actions appropriately (except having guys jump out and swear) and can work with a PC Steering Wheel. Which of course will be an essential purchase to aid her driving skills.<br />
 <br />
 I'm thinking something on PC but am open to console suggestions too.<br />
 <br />
 Any ideas chaps?</div>

Unfortunately, I am having a hard time figuring out the proper tech to use and would appreciate some help in the matter.<br />

What should I use? It has to be relatively small (about wrist watch size for the sender and candy bar size for the receiver). I only need the signal to travel a 150 feet max.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Couple things:<br />
<br />
1. AM I losing my mind or am I not getting bonus energy from Fire barrier anymore since GU4?<br />
<br />
2. I've crashed three times to desktop in the history of Vanguard since it came out. GU5 has made me crash Thrice. Something is wrong. <br />
<br />
3. I'm level 45, and I think the money train is slowing down from quests and SCL drops. This is disappointing, as The riftways are eating up money as fast as I can make it. <br />
<br />
4. Markets are no that good. We produce a lot of surplus for players in all the places except the ones we need one. It's getting to be a pain because of lack of population. However, if you're new - I'm sure you'll have a flood of goods available to you at the lower end.<br />
<br />
5. More quests. I need more diplomacy quests, More NPCs with diplomacy, and an easier XP curve. PLEASE. This is getting VT-esque.<br />
<br />
6. More people should play this game. Taking a step back in stability is not going to help it, and GU6 and 7 need to happen in a way that makes the game stable and brings in players. My suggestion: More housing features - Mailboxes, crafting tables, Interactive stuff like books. GET ON IT.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've been participating here for a while, so I think I'll take my own stab at the Community Opinion Poll.<br />

<a href="http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Whisperwind&amp;n=Yttrium" target="_blank"><br />
Pimp my mage!</a><br />
<br />
Anything goes - you can rebuild from scratch, you can suggest new talent builds, whatever you like. If you want to know why I picked the things I did, or options I considered (or are currently considering), I'll answer all of that, too.<br />
<br />
My Current Playstyle:<br />
5-man support, we're just starting heroics. Team is: Warrior tank, Druid healer, Warlock (aff/demo hybrid), Druid kitty. No Draenei benefits. Tailoring and Enchanting to 375, but without a lot of "special" recipes. Factions are listed, of course.<br />
<br />
Gear suggestions need to come from non-raid options; unfortunately, this precludes any 10-man gear. PVP is an option, but only as a last resort. I have lots of quests still available in Netherstorm, if there's a particular item that is of interest from out there. All other solo/5-man quests have been done in all other zones.<br />
<br />
Also, thanks! And props to Maledict for helping me out with my current gear and talent spec from previous discussions. Now I'm ready to move forward!</div>
