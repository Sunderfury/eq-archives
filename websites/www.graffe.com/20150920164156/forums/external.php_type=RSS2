			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've posted about this a few times before. Every now and then EA gives away a free classic game as a way to get people to try their Origin service. It's basically advertising, as when you log in to download your free game you also happen to see their banners proclaiming whatever new release they have coming up is available for pre-order.<br />
<br />
At any rate, if you like RTS games and never tried it, or already own it physical and would like a digital version, Red Alert 2 along with it's expansion are free at the moment. There was a brief issue where demand was too high and they ran out of keys, but it's available again now.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I couldn't quite decide if I should put this in the yearly release thread or make a new one for it. Opinions?<br />
<br />
As the title states, the game has been delayed, though supposedly the core is done and they are just tuning gameplay now. The trailer they showed off backs this up; the game basically looks finished. Pretty good trailer. I'm adding links to both the original Japanese trailer and a version with English subtitles made by fans. Atlus has this thing where they pretend they don't understand how the internet works and will issue takedowns on fan translations of their trailers so they can produce their own versions later. It's weird.<br />
<br />
English Subtitled:<br />

In related news, this was announced and shown during the Tokyo Game Show this year. I don't think I'll make a thread for it, but it seems to be a better year than usual, with plenty of stuff we may look forward to in the future.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I need advice from the board, something I don't think I've ever done here, but I am beginning to lose hope.  To be clear, this case involves a friend, not me (yes really).  I apologize for this being long, but it's a long story.<br />
<br />
A friend has been going through a divorce for over a year now.  She doesn't have many assets, so it's mostly held up because of child custody and the fact the father still seems to think they can get back together.  His parents also have money, which has allowed him to get a better lawyer and really drag out the case.<br />
<br />
Normally I would not interject myself into such matters, except he's a heroin addict and the now 3 year old girl caught in the middle is a very nice innocent child and friend of my 2 year old daughter.<br />
<br />
But here is where things have gotten crazy and causes so much despair.  Despite the father having drug convictions in the last 2 years and and not finishing court appointed rehabilitation,  the court still sides with him every single time they go to court.<br />
<br />
My friend obviously wants sole custody, however she's been willing to split custody if he agreed to drug tests (which he refuses for obvious reasons).  I believe child custody specifically is still in mediation, a judge may not have ruled on some of that.<br />
<br />
But last week things turned south.  About a month ago he showed up to a kid's birthday party either drunk or high.  My friend was obviously not there, but the daughter was (it was a birthday party for another child at daycare).  The other parents at this party were so concerned from his behavior that many of them called child protective services (great!).<br />
<br />
CPS first issued a protection order, saying my friend should not allow visitation again until heard by a judge (that makes sense!).  But then, a couple of days later they call her up and tell her &quot;well, our order of protection really has no authority, you still have to allow access.  But if anything happens it's still your fault&quot;.  And a few days after that they said the order of protection was rescinded.  Keep in mind this whole time the father was never once drug tested (although heroin can be tough since it can be out of your system in as little as 3 days).<br />
<br />
However, because she refused to allow visitation because of this obvious problem, his lawyer filed contempt charges on her.  Which brings us back to last week where she was found guilty of contempt and ordered to pay his lawyer $1000 for refusing visitation 2 times.  If CPS getting calls from 3rd party parents does not warrant clear danger wtf does?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is also not the first incident.  About 6 months ago he drove drunk (with a suspended license) to a title loan place with his daughter.  The title loan place was so concerned that they called the police.  The police, made someone else come pick him and the girl up and would not allow him to drive home because of the suspended license, but did not drug / alcohol test him.  We did learn later the cop does know the father's lawyer, I don't know if this played a role, but likely.<br />
<br />
One time the daughter came home from visitation with severe bruising in her pelvic area.  She was taken to the hospital where the doctor said it was very extensive and serious and more than a child falling down, not likely sexual but she would have screamed out in pain.  But the court dismissed the doctor and pictures because the father said 'it must have happened at daycare, I didn't notice anything'.  The daycare worker (a woman who runs it out of her house and doesn't want to cause waves, but also apparently doesn't care about the interest of the child) said it was possible, but she doesn't remember anything either.  To answer the obvious question, we've tried to convince the mother to switch to a different, better daycare that would report abuse but she doesn't have enough money.  And unfortunately makes too much money to get help from the state, even though she only makes like 30k a year I think.<br />
<br />
He's also on video of making skype calls with his daughter to the mother in an obviously high state.  The video's aren't great, but you can see where he slurs speech and has trouble even staying awake on camera while holding the child.<br />
<br />
Here's the bottom line:<br />
<ul><li style="">He uses heroin regularly, while in custody of his daughter.</li><li style="">One mutual friend of the mother even let slip he did heroin with the father as recent as a month ago.  I'm pretty sure he's doing it every week, he can't stop himself.</li><li style="">The child has repeatedly said daddy passes out and sleeps a lot when she's there.</li><li style="">The child's blanket has 6 burn marks on it from when he was passed out.  She says 'she had to wake up daddy to put out the fire', they look like cigarette burns to me.</li><li style="">Even after a year and a half the mother is responsible for his health care because they are still married.</li><li style="">Because they are still married there is no child support yet (I think).  He may have been ordered to pay some, but he doesn't work and has never paid any.</li><li style="">Her lawyer is terrible, but because she's already paid him 6k she's broke and doesn't have enough to retain a new one.  Honestly I'm not sure how his overly poor performance is not criminal.  Besides showing up for court he's done no obvious work and my wife seems to know more about custody court than he does.</li><li style="">CPS is aware of all of this and has refused to do anything, claiming the child is fine.  The one time they issued a protection order it was rescinded and the one time they said they would drug test, they never did.</li><li style="">He has now convinced the child to say not only bad things about mommy's new daddy, but that he touches her in inappropriate places. I know the guy, he's great, and these claims didn't start until the girl said she like's mommy's boyfriend better than daddy.  He's also rarely alone with the girl.</li><li style="">He also regularly doesn't even show for his scheduled visitations.  Which i realize is minor compared to everything else, but it really messes with their lives too.  Which honestly I thought was enough to get you in trouble if you do it often enough.  But apparently not.</li></ul><br />
<br />
I'm at my wits end because this child is going to die.  If not now, eventually.  Either he does something stupid with her in the car / house or she learns his drug ways and is her own addict at an early age.  He's already driven drunk / high with her in the car and nearly burned the house down while passed out.<br />
<br />
This is something I can't watch happen.  But what am I supposed to do when CPS, the police and the court system all refuse to do anything about it?  I know people blow things out of proportion when custody is at stake, but there is simply too much here to ignore, stuff that I know is true and has more witnesses than just an angry mother.  But that's basically how they treat her, as an angry ex wife who will say anything to deny him custody.  But all it really looks like is they are all getting paid off by his lawyer to give him the child.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas I'm all ears.  Something has to be done to save the child.  I've tried to find ways to get her money back from the lawyer (so she has money to get a new one), but that seems impossible unless he's actually missed court dates.  We've had dozens of people calling CPS, and not just 'mommy's friends'.  And worst of all, google has failed to help me find another solution.  Damn you google!</div>

			<b>It comes after McDonald&#8217;s rejected Burger King&#8217;s offer in August.</b><br />
<br />
Burger King is teaming up with a slew of other fast food chains to hand out free burgers on Sept. 21 in honor of the United Nations&#8217; International Day of Peace on Monday, USA Today reported.<br />
<br />
The chain is working with Denny&#8217;s, Wayback Burgers, Krystal, and Giraffas to hand out 1,500 &#8220;peace day burgers&#8221; to hungry customers at a pop-up restaurant in Atlanta, according to USA Today.<br />
<br />
Per USA Today:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			&#8220;Burger King says the companies will give away the burgers on first-come, first-serve basis at a pop-up location near the Georgia Tech campus in Atlanta. The burger will include elements of the Whopper, Denny&#8217;s Bacon Slamburger, Wayback&#8217;s Wayback Classic, Krystal&#8217;s cheese Krystal, and Giraffas&#8217; Brutus.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The move comes after Burger King took out a full-page ad in the Chicago Tribune and the New York Times calling on main competitor McDonald&#8217;s to collaborate on a &#8220;McWhopper,&#8221; or a combined Burger King Whopper with a McDonald&#8217;s Big Mac. But CEO Steve Easterbrook penned an open letter saying that the company wouldn&#8217;t commit to a partnership. He wrote on Facebook:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			&#8220;Dear Burger King,<br />
<br />
Inspiration for a good cause&#8230; great idea.<br />
<br />
We love the intention but think our two brands could do something bigger to make a difference.<br />
<br />
We commit to raise awareness worldwide, perhaps you&#8217;ll join us in a meaningful global effort?<br />
<br />
And every day, let&#8217;s acknowledge that between us there is simply a friendly business competition and certainly not the unequaled circumstances of the real pain and suffering of war.<br />
<br />
We&#8217;ll be in touch.<br />
<br />
-Steve, McDonald&#8217;s CEO<br />
<br />
P.S. A simple phone call will do next time.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The McWhopper that Burger King hoped to create would have been sold to benefit the organization, Peace One Day, which promotes the United Nation&#8217;s day to bring awareness to world peace set for Monday.<br />
<br />
&#8220;As far as McDonald&#8217;s goes, any activity they undertake, whether in partnership with Burger King or on their own, would be incredible, as it will raise further awareness for Peace Day,&#8221; BK senior vice president Fernando Machado said in a statement. &#8220;And inadvertently, the McWhopper has 100% become a reality for some. The public wholeheartedly embraced the campaign and thousands of DIY McWhoppers have been created, reviewed, and shared on social media.&#8221;

			A British Isis member living in Syria has complained about the &quot;bad manners&quot; of Arab fellow militants he says steal his shoes, eat like children and dont queue.<br />
 <br />
In an online blog Omar Hussain, a former security guard at Morrisons supermarket who previously lived in High Wycombe, also said other jihadists invade his space, talk loudly when he is trying to sleep and behave like children.<br />
<br />
The Arabs and the non-Arabs are united in one line, he says, writing under the Islamist name Abu Saeed al Britani.<br />
<br />
However, with the unification of tribes and cultures, there will be clashes.<br />
<br />
He warns Western radicals thinking of fleeing to Syria: Arabs as a whole have a unique culture, which differs dramatically from the western lifestyle<br />
<br />
Under a series of numbered subheadings, Mr Hussain criticises various annoying habits he has encountered while living in Syria.<br />
<br />
Attacking Arab's administration skills, he said: There is no queue in any of their offices.<br />
<br />
You could be waiting in line for half an hour and then another Arab would come and push in the queue and go straight in.<br />
<br />
Under the heading of etiquettes when eating, he writes: Our Arab brothers, or Syrians to be more precise, lack  basic manners.<br />
<br />
When serving food to his fellow terrorists, he said he was pounced upon by everyone in the room.<br />
<br />
I therefore refused to give anyone food until every single one of them was sitting down in their seats, he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately I had to treat them like primary school students.<br />
<br />
Other bizarre habits detailed by Mr Hussain include stealing shoes.<br />
<br />
In the West, it is common knowledge to walk out of a room wearing the same pair of shoes that you wore while entering the room. Nay, it is common sense, he says.<br />
<br />
However here in Sh&#257;m, our Syrian brothers  believe that everyone can share each others footwear.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you would enter a building and when leaving, you would see the person with your shoes walking 100 yards ahead of you and it can be quite irritating.<br />
<br />
Other complaints from Mr Hussain include Arabs casually tak[ing] your phone off charge to charge their own phone; going through other peoples property without their permission; and being childish in their dealings and mannerisms.<br />
<br />
The 27-year-old Hussain fled to Syria in January 2014 and initially trained and fought with al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, before defecting to Isis.<br />
<br />
He has since threatened to bomb the UK and appeared in propaganda videos urging the West to send ground troops so extremists could send them back one-by-one in coffins.

			<b>Story highlights</b><br />
<ul><li style="">President Obama invites teen to White House, tweeting, &quot;We should inspire more kids like you to like science&quot;</li><li style="">14-year-old who loves to create made a clock and brought it to his Irving, Texas, school</li><li style="">Police handcuffed him after he told them it was only a clock; then said there was no evidence that clock was dangerous</li></ul><br />
<br />
<br />
(CNN)When Ahmed Mohamed went to his high school in Irving, Texas, Monday, he was so excited. A teenager with dreams of becoming an engineer, he wanted to show his teacher the digital clock he'd made from a pencil case.<br />
<br />
The 14-year-old's day ended not with praise, but punishment, after the school called police and he was arrested. A photo shows Ahmed, wearing a NASA t-shirt, looking confused and upset as he's being led out of school in handcuffs.<br />
<br />
&quot;They arrested me and they told me that I committed the crime of a hoax bomb, a fake bomb,&quot; the freshman later explained to WFAA after authorities released him. <br />
<br />
Irving Police spokesman Officer James McLellan told the station, &quot;We attempted to question the juvenile about what it was and he would simply only tell us that it was a clock.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teenager did that because, well, it was a clock, he said.<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, police announced that the teen will not be charged. <br />
<br />
Chief Larry Boyd said that Ahmed should have been &quot;forthcoming&quot; by going beyond the description that what he made was a clock. But Boyd said that authorities determined that the teenager did not intend to alarm anyone and the device, which the chief called &quot;a homemade experiment,&quot; was innocuous. <br />
<br />
<b>Social media reacts</b><br />
<br />
Outrage over the incident -- with many saying the student was profiled because he's Muslim -- spread on social media as #IStandWithAhmed started trending worldwide on Twitter with more than 100,000 tweets Tuesday morning. The school's Facebook page is roiling with sharp criticism of the way the teen was treated, and the hashtag #engineersforahmed is gaining popularity.<br />
<br />
President Barack Obama, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and thousands of others are showing support for Ahmed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool clock, Ahmed,&quot; Obama tweeted. &quot;Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clinton tweeted that &quot;assumptions don't keep us safe&quot; and urged the teenager to &quot;keep building.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think this wouldn't even be a question if his name wasn't Ahmed Mohamed,&quot; said Alia Salem of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. &quot;He is an excited kid who is very bright and wants to share it with his teachers.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>Many criticized the school on Facebook. </b><br />
<br />
Kevin McKinney posted, &quot;How did a bunch of complete idiots end up accidentally running a school? Were you all yanked out of a zoo and given paychecks? Learning centers are for teaching...not for ruining innocent people's lives with your racism and pathetic stupidity!...&quot;This kid is destined to be something great if the dimwits of Irving don't ruin him first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mocking Irving Schools' motto, Bill Cain wrote: &quot;'Where children come first'...to jail in handcuffs. Way to go, Irving.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chance Williams posted, &quot;Ahmed Mohamed deserves a public apology from you, the school administrators, police, and teachers involved in his arrest. I hope he sues, and the school district has to pay for his college education.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>Teen's father saw son surrounded by police</b><br />
<br />
Texas law stipulates that a person who commits a hoax bomb offense is one who &quot;knowingly manufactures, sells, purchases, transports, or possesses a hoax bomb with intent to use&quot; it or intentionally causes alarm or reaction. <br />
<br />
Ahmed's father Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, who immigrated from Sudan and has twice run for that country's presidency, told CNN Wednesday that he was upset that the school did not contact him immediately to tell him about the situation. <br />
<br />
The first he heard of it was when he received a call from police, who said his son was being charged with having a hoax bomb, Mohamed said. <br />
<br />
He rushed to the police station where he saw his son &quot;surrounded by five police and he was handcuffed,&quot; the father said. Ahmed told his father that he'd asked to phone him but the police told him that he could not because he was under arrest, Mohamed recounted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I asked if I could talk to or speak to my son and they told me, 'No, not right now' because they were taking his fingerprints and asking him questions,&quot; Mohamed said. &quot;I asked if I could see the thing they were calling a bomb. The police never let me even see it but I knew what my son brought to school. It was an alarm clock that he made. He wakes up with it most mornings...&quot;<br />
<br />
Police are holding the clock as evidence, Mohamed said.<br />
<br />
A reporter at a news conference Wednesday asked Chief Boyd about the allegations that Ahmed was told he could not call his father and was interrogated alone for some time at the station. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not aware of that,&quot; the chief said, adding that the incident isn't being investigated.<br />
<br />
Boyd was also asked if the teen's religious or ethnic identity played a role in how he was treated. The chief said it did not, and he praised the department's relationship with Irving's Muslim community.<br />
<br />
However, he said, &quot;We live in an age where you can't take things like that to school.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>'People think Muslims are terrorists'</b><br />
<br />
&quot;My son is a very brilliant boy,&quot; Mohamed said. &quot;We need people like him in this country.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teen has never been in trouble before, the father said, saying confidently that he thinks this is a case of Islamophobia. &quot;My son's name is Mohamed -- people just think Muslims are terrorists but we are peaceful, we are not that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We live in the land of opportunity to grow and help and the people who did this to my son, they do not see him that way,&quot; Mohamed continued. &quot;My son said over and over that this was an alarm clock and my son only brought it to school to ask for help from his teachers, to show that he can do this amazing thing and maybe get appreciation and to show him (he can become) something bigger in the world -- an inventor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mohamed said it wasn't until after the fact that he received a call and an email from the school, telling him about Ahmed's arrest and informing him that his son had been suspended for three days.<br />
<br />
The father and others were meeting Wednesday with attorneys to decide what steps, if any, they might take next, Mohamed told CNN.<br />
<br />
At the Wednesday news conference, a spokeswoman for the Irving Independent School District told reporters that the way the teen's experience has been described in media reports is &quot;unbalanced.&quot;<br />
<br />
She declined to explain why, citing the need to protect a student's privacy. When the family gives written permission to discuss the incident, the school will offer more information, she said. <br />
<br />
Earlier in the day, MacArthur High School provided a statement to CNN in which it said it was cooperating with authorities and said privacy laws prohibited it from sharing details about student discipline. &quot;We can assure everyone that school administrators are handling the situation in accordance with the Irving ISD Student Code of Conduct and applicable laws.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mohamed isn't sure if his son will go back to school Thursday. He's afraid the police will keep his invention and he's worried about being called names. <br />
<br />
But he's happy about the widespread outpouring of support. His family started the hashtag #Thankyouforstandingwithme.<br />
<br />
&quot;It gives him hope,&quot; the teen's father said. &quot;Right now he is trying just stay positive and is listening to the news about him and reading about people's comments him on social media. It's really too much for him to take in right now, but long term it will be good for him. He doesn't want to show he is a victim.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was an English teacher who got spooked and reported Ahmed to the principal, the police said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We always ask our students and staff to immediately report if they observe any suspicious items and/or suspicious behavior,&quot; the school's statement reads. &quot;If something is out of the ordinary, the information should be reported immediately to a school administrator and/or the police so it can be addressed right away. We will always take necessary precautions to protect our students and keep our school community as safe as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
A reporter spoke with the boy in his bedroom, which is full of equipment that allows him to tinker and create. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here in high school, none of the teachers know what I can do,&quot; Ahmed told the paper while he soldered metal and played around with a cable. <br />
<br />
A middle school robotics club member, the teen has won awards for his inventions.<br />
<br />
He recalled showing one teacher the clock and her telling him that she thought it was &quot;nice&quot; but he shouldn't show other instructors, according to the paper. The teen put the clock in his bookbag but an alarm beeped in the middle of 6th period and Ahmed showed the teacher what he had, the newspaper reported.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was like, it looks like a bomb,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told her, 'It doesn't look like a bomb to me.'&quot;<br />
<br />
When Ahmed was called out of class, he said he was brought into a room with four police officers, one of whom said, &quot;Yup. That's who I thought it was.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ahmed told the Dallas Morning News that he felt aware of what he looked like and his name as the officers fired questions at him. <br />
<br />
He recalled that one officer said to him, &quot;So you tried to make a bomb?&quot;<br />
<br />
He disputed that and kept telling them he'd created a clock. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the teen's defenders continue to slam the school and police.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really hope you guys are absolutely ashamed for possibly ruining the ingenuity of one bright kid who made a CLOCK for crying out loud. What kind of education does your professors have?&quot; David Velez wrote on the school's Facebook page. &quot;It sounds like they are the ones that need to be going back to school!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shame on your school and its administration for arresting Ahmed Mohamed,&quot; wrote Jillian York. &quot;Way to stifle a kid's creativity and energy. I hope you're all replaced with compassionate, non-racist, administrators and teachers.&quot;

			Praise Be Unto You<br />
September 13, 2015 <br />
<br />
It is I, Megareverend and C.E.O. of Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption Church, Pastor John Oliver. <br />
<br />
We thank you for all your kind donations, but Im sorry to report that we have closed down the church. And let me take a moment to explain why - its certainly not because we have to. <br />
<br />
We have still, miraculously, not broken any laws by promising you untold riches in return for sending us money. Were also not closing down because you all kept sending us actual seeds, even though we explicitly told you not to. Were closing because multiple people sent us sperm through the mail. And when someone sends you jizz through the mail, its time to stop whatever youre doing. <br />
<br />
So we are shutting this s**t down. Praise be!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Summary version of article: employers are experimenting with data chips embedded in the ID lanyards their employees wear. These chips monitor things like how many times an employee pushes away from their desk, how often and for how long they speak at meetings, etc. They're also scanning employee e-mails to figure out who employees are associating with and for how long.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/how-new-data-collection-technology-might-change-office-culture-1.3196065" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/ho...ture-1.3196065</a><br />
<br />
An organizational behaviour professor thinks that the drawbacks of such data gathering, including discouraging trial-and-error learning, outweigh any perceived benefits:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/too-orwellian-companies-monitoring-personal-time-for-self-improvement-1.3196321" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/to...ment-1.3196321</a><br />
<br />
My first instinct, if I worked for a company that tried to implement this, would be to tell the company to get stuffed. While the technology could potentially be used to improve efficiency, I feel it's much more likely to be used improperly: &quot;You only spoke five times last meeting, negative performance review inc.&quot; But would I feel the same way if I were the employer or manager, and it was another source of information I could use to gain insight on employee behaviours? Does anyone here work in an environment where personal behaviour is tracked and monitored, and how do you feel about it?</div>
