		<blockquote class="restore">Got an email Monday, forwarded from one of our AAs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alert: all tenants must be aware there MAY be a power outage of a minimum of two hours in the next few weeks due to electrical work being performed by our electric company.  This outage will occur during business hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
I immediately go to our office VP and explain that 90+% of my office would not be able to work from home due to the way our custom program infrastructure works, which runs off our file server.<br />
<br />
He asks for some suggestions/comments, then sends an email to the landlord.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, our neighboring office, which is actually smaller than ours, and is the only other occupied office out of 11? suites in this building, sends the landlord an email saying &quot;You can't do that, we have no generator.&quot;<br />
<br />
Come to find out that the landlord had no idea that, after their biggest tenant moved out 18 months ago, the nearly-school-bus-sized generator they leased wasn't patched into the rest of the electric system for the building.  To do so would take weeks of reconfiguring a 25 foot electrical panel (or so the maintenance manager states) so the landlord is &quot;going into negotiations with the electricity vendor&quot; to try to get our window of downtime moved outside of business hours.<br />
<br />
However, naturally, I would need to be present at the start and end of this window, to shut servers down gracefully and bring everything back on once it's possible.<br />
<br />
But upon informing Netops of the downtime, they still don't understand why we don't just leave everything alone - because they still have not absorbed/learned that the generator isn't connected, and that our aging APC Backups units will only power one server for 20 minutes (and I have 4, plus 7 routers and switches).<br />
<br />
It gets better in an unrelated way:<br />
<br />
Due to an offhand comment I made during my report to the office VP about the uselessness of most of our tools from a remote location that has no access to the internal server, I start getting a bunch of emails from the development manager and my manager asking for timing, speedtests, etc.<br />
<br />
I tell them that I haven't worked from home since one of the tools was last updated, because it's slower than cold molasses in Siberia in January.<br />
In-office, it takes ~18 seconds for the program to load and log in.<br />
Out-office, it takes ~3 minutes.  And that's not even going into searching, data edits, etc.<br />
<br />
So the dev manager replies to me and says &quot;Why don't you just copy the EXE folder for the tool to your PC and run it direct?  It doesn't need to access the server.&quot;<br />
<br />
*facepalm*<br />
<br />
Well, considering none of our other tools in the last 8 years have had that capability, why would I suddenly hope that a new one would suddenly gain a level and be, you know, useful?</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Place I work has hundreds of servers set up in arrays, and one array has over 100 desktop-design servers running off of about 50 APC shoebox-style UPS units.  Well, I wanted to set up a time when that array is being used the least to take it down gently and run a UPS test on all 50 APC's and swap out the ones that have weak batteries (I refurb the ones that are removed with new batteries later on).  But for the past several months, the golden boy of our Dev team has insisted on using the array during our maintenance time.  So we haven't swapped out a unit in several months unless it catastrophically failed due to a battery short.  Nobody seemed to care about regular maintenance, and my requests for a little down time were dismissed out of hand.<br />
 <br />
A week ago this past Sunday, there was a power failure that lasted about an hour.  Naturally, all the units went down completely.  I bet some of them, the ones that needed new batteries, lasted 10 minutes tops.  So the entire array crashed instead of shutting down gracefully.  Our awesome Dev team appears to have never closed a record in their lives, because they'll just have to re-open it later I guess is the rationale.  So a graceful shutdown is kinda NECESSARY considering their shitty programming skillz.<br />
 <br />
Anyway, after the blackout and the entire Sunday spent fixing the boo-boos, it was *I* who got yelled at, because the UPS units &quot;failed.&quot;  Let's see, not allowed to do maintenance for 3-4 months, the power outage lasted about an hour, and we had two servers per UPS because $$$, but it's all my fault because I'm apparently the magical computer fairy and I should have brought along more pixie dust or something!</blockquote>

Boss ofcourse comes to me and asks me if I know that.<br />
<br />
I tell him that yes I do indeed know that Luser1 managed to ruin both USB ports and that no I don't think I can repair them (short of taking a soldering iron to the mainboard). <br />
I also tell him, because I'm in a really bad mood, that Luser1 did not only wreck the company's presentation-notebook but also previously fucked up the display on his personal-issue notebook. He also managed to ruin the DVD drive of that one. So when it no longer worked he came and took the presentation-notebook whenever he needed one.<br />
<br />
And to top it off he only needs the USB ports to plug in his private portable HD which is full of pirated music. Private data storage devices are not allowed to be connected to company computers. He doesn't give a shit.<br />
OH THE HUMANITY.<br />

</div>so today this guy walks into my office again and has the nerve to ask if his new laptop is due anytime soon.

</div>Somebody has to be the scapegoat.  Hopefully you saved all those emails (and hopefully they were emails) you sent requesting maintenance and the replies that there was no way.  Although it just sounds like somebody wanted someone else to blame when someone much higher came to find out why this happened.<br />

Additionally, I bet you get your maintenance time for a little while now.</blockquote>
