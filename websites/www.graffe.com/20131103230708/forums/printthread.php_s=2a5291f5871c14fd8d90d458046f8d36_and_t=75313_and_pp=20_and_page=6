Dear Cohen,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for sharing your thoughts regarding the National Security Agencys surveillance program. I especially appreciate your patience awaiting a response while we have been setting up our offices in Washington and at home in Texas. It is an honor to represent Texas in the Senate and respond to your concerns.<br />
<br />
During my time in the Senate, I have consistently reiterated my support of programs that can detect impending threats to our homeland or diplomatic and military facilities abroad.  It is imperative, however, that we strike an appropriate balance between remaining vigilant against terrorism and protecting the civil liberties guaranteed to the American people by the Constitution.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the government has eroded the American peoples trust by the secrecy surrounding these surveillance programs. I will continue working with my Senate colleagues to review existing law and the actions of the Administration to ensure that we protect our Constitutional liberties.  In doing so, I hope to guarantee true accountability in these programs so that we protect Americans from the threats of both terrorism and unwarranted government intrusion.<br />
<br />
Thank you for sharing your views with me. Please feel free to contact me in the future about any issue important to your family. It is an honor to serve you and the people of Texas.<br />

<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">

			<b>The U.S. government in July obtained a search warrant demanding that Edward Snowdens e-mail provider, Lavabit, turn over the private SSL keys that protected all web traffic to the site, according to to newly unsealed documents.</b><br />
<br />
The July 16 order came after Texas-based Lavabit refused to circumvent its own security systems to comply with earlier orders intended to monitor a particular Lavabit users metadata, defined as information about each communication sent or received by the account, including the date and time of the communication, the method of communication, and the source and destination of the communication.<br />
<br />
The name of the target is redacted from the unsealed records, but the offenses under investigation are listed as violations of the Espionage Act and theft of government property  the exact charges that have been filed against NSA whistleblower Snowden in the same Virginia court.<br />
<br />
The records in the case, which is now being argued at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, were unsealed today by a federal judge in Alexandria, Virginia. They confirm much of what had been suspected about the conflict between the pro-privacy e-mail company and the federal government, which led to Lavabit voluntarily closing in August rather than compromise the security it promised users.<br />
<br />
The filings show that Lavabit was served on June 28 with a so-called pen register order requiring it to record, and provide the government with, the e-mail from and to lines on every e-mail, as well as the IP address used to access the mailbox. Because they provide only metadata, pen register orders can be obtained without probable cause that the target has committed a crime.<br />
<br />
In the standard language for such an order, it required Lavabit to provide all technical assistance necessary to accomplish the installation and use of the pen/trap device<br />
<br />
A conventional e-mail provider can easily funnel email headers to the government in response to such a request. But Lavabit offered paying customers a secure email service that stores incoming messages encrypted to a key known only to that user. Lavabit itself did not have access.<br />
<br />
Lavabit founder Ladar Levison balked at the demand, and the government filed a motion to compel Lavabit to comply. Lavabit told the feds that the user had enabled Lavabits encryption services, and thus Lavabit would not provide the requested information, the government wrote.<br />
<br />
The representative of Lavabit indicated that Lavabit had the technical capability to decrypt the information, but that Lavabit did not want to defeat [its] own system, the government complained.<br />
<br />
U.S. Magistrate Judge Theresa Buchanan immediately ordered Lavabit to comply, threatening Levison with criminal contempt  which could have potentially put him in jail. <br />
<br />
By July 9, Lavabit still hadnt defeated its security for the government, and prosecutors asked for a summons to be served for Lavabit, and founder Ladar Levison, to be held in contempt for its disobedience and resistance to these lawful orders.<br />
<br />
A week later, prosecutors upped the ante and obtained the search warrant demanding all information necessary to decrypt communications sent to or from the Lavabit e-mail account [redacted] including encryption keys and SSL keys.<br />
<br />
With the SSL keys, and a wiretap, the FBI could have decrypted all web sessions between Lavabit users and the site, though the documents indicate the bureau still trying only to capture metadata on one user.<br />
<br />
Levison went to court to fight the demand on August 1, in a closed-door hearing before Claude M. Hilton, Senior U. S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. <br />
<br />
The privacy of  Lavabits users are at stake, Lavabit attorney Jesse Binnall told Hilton. Were not simply speaking of the target of this investigation. Were talking about over 400,000 individuals and entities that are users of Lavabit who use this service because they believe their communications are secure. By handing over the keys, the encryption keys in this case, they necessarily become less secure.<br />
<br />
By this point, Levison was evidently willing to comply with the original order, and modify his code to intercept the metadata on one user. But the government was no longer interested.<br />
<br />
Anything done by Mr. Levison in terms of writing code or whatever, we have to trust Mr. Levison that we have gotten the information that we were entitled to get since June 28th, prosecutor James Trump told the judge. Hes had every opportunity to propose solutions to come up with ways to address his concerns and he simply hasnt.<br />
<br />
We can assure the court that the way that this would operate, while the metadata stream would be captured by a device, the device does not download, does not store, no one looks at it, Trump said. It filters everything, and at the back end of the filter, we get what were required to get under the order.<br />
<br />
So theres no agents looking through the 400,000 other bits of information, customers, whatever, Trump added. No one looks at that, no one stores it, no one has access to it.<br />
<br />
All right, said Hilton. Well, I think thats reasonable.<br />
<br />
Hilton ruled for the government. [The] governments clearly entitled to the information that theyre seeking, and just because you-all have set up a system that makes that difficult, that doesnt in any way lessen the governments right to receive that<br />
 information just as they could from any telephone company or any other e-mail source that could provide it easily, said Hilton.<br />
<br />
The judge also rejected Lavabits motion to unseal the record. This is an ongoing criminal investigation, and theres no leeway to disclose any information about it.<br />
<br />
In an interesting work-around, Levison complied the next day by turning over the private SSL keys as an 11 page printout in 4-point type. The government, not unreasonably, called the printout illegible. <br />
<br />
To make use of these keys, the FBI would have to manually input all 2,560 characters, and one incorrect keystroke in this laborious process would render the FBI collection system incapable of collecting decrypted data, prosecutors wrote.<br />
<br />
The court ordered Levison to provide a more useful electronic copy. By August 5, Lavabit was still resisting the order, and the judge ordered that Levison would be fined $5,000 a day beginning August 6 until he handed over electronic copies of the keys.<br />

On August 8, Levison shuttered Lavabit, making any attempt at surveillance moot. Still under a gag order, he posted an oblique message saying hed been left with little choice in the matter. <br />
<br />
I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly 10 years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit, Levison wrote at the time. After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations.<br />

Lavabit has raised approximately $30,000 in an <a href="https://rally.org/lavabit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">online fundraising drive</a> to finance its appeal to the 4th Circuit. Today the appeals court extended the deadline for opening briefs to October 10. <br />

			BERLIN  Edward J. Snowden, the fugitive American security contractor granted temporary asylum by Russia, has appealed to Washington to stop treating him like a traitor for revealing that the United States has been eavesdropping on its allies, a German politician who met with Mr. Snowden said on Friday. <br />
<br />
Mr. Snowden made his appeal in a letter that was carried to Berlin by Hans-Christian Ströbele, a veteran member of the Green Party in the German Parliament. Mr. Ströbele said he and two journalists for German news outlets met with Mr. Snowden and a person described as his assistant  probably his British aide, Sarah Harrison  at an undisclosed location in or near Moscow on Thursday for almost three hours. <br />
<br />
Mr. Ströbele had gone to Moscow to explore whether Mr. Snowden could or would testify before a planned parliamentary inquiry into the eavesdropping. Any arrangements for Mr. Snowden to testify would require significant legal maneuvering, as it seemed unlikely that he would travel to Germany for fear of extradition to the United States. <br />
<br />
In his letter, Mr. Snowden, 30, also appealed for clemency. He said his disclosures about American intelligence activity at home and abroad, which he called systematic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act, have had positive effects. <br />
<br />
Yet my government continues to treat dissent as defection, and seeks to criminalize political speech with felony charges that provide no defense, Mr. Snowden wrote. However, speaking the truth is not a crime. I am confident that with the support of the international community, the government of the United States will abandon this harmful behavior. <br />
<br />
Mr. Ströbele, 74, is a seasoned left-wing defense lawyer and the longest-serving member of the parliamentary committee that oversees German intelligence. At a packed news conference after his return to Berlin, he said he was contacted about going to Moscow late last week after the German government said Chancellor Angela Merkels cellphone might have been tapped by American intelligence agents. He declined to elaborate, but said he has had no dealings with the Russian authorities or the German Embassy in Moscow. <br />
<br />
He deftly parried requests to reveal more, while appealing to the governments and citizens of Germany, France and the United States to stop treating Mr. Snowden as a criminal. <br />
<br />
Instead, Mr. Ströbele said, echoing an opinion gaining support here, Germany should thank Mr. Snowden. After ARD, the premier German television network, reported on Thursday night about the Moscow visit, it broadcast a commentary arguing that Germany should show gratitude for his exposure of United States intelligence practices. <br />
<br />
Mr. Ströbele said he had found Mr. Snowden lucid and well informed. He said he had been told that Mr. Snowden was allowed to go shopping, but Mr. Ströbele declined to reveal any other details about Mr. Snowdens routine. <br />
<br />
News about the visit to Moscow eclipsed a number of interviews given on Thursday by the American ambassador, John B. Emerson, who tried to assuage German fears that the United States Embassy in Berlin was the center for monitoring Ms. Merkel and other well-placed Germans. <br />
<br />
Mr. Emerson, who arrived in Berlin two months ago and is a strong proponent of a landmark American and European trade deal under negotiation, was summoned to the German Foreign Ministry last week after Berlins suspicions about eavesdropping on Ms. Merkel were made public. The action was unprecedented in post-World War II relations between the United States and Germany. <br />
<br />
Ms. Merkel, while palpably angry in appearances last week, has made no direct statements since, quietly sending two senior advisers to Washington this week to begin re-establishing the trust she said had been breached. <br />
<br />
Mr. Ströbeles news conference yielded moments of humor as well. At one point, his cellphone rang. He pulled it out, looked at it and asked cheerfully, Does anybody know the chancellors number? <br />
<br />
Asked to speculate about which intelligence services might have monitored his trip to Moscow, he said with a smile, I assume that they are all interested.

I view House of Cards as another guilty pleasure -- the show asks for far too much suspension of disbelief, but I enjoy it anyway. Spacey and Robin Wright (yet another member of the We Get Hotter As We Get Older club) are very engaging.</blockquote>

What Clausewitz meant wasn't that warfare is a bit like a long drawn-out debate in a large room somewhere, but that war can only be used as a means to a specific political end.<br />
You can use warfare to kick Saddam out of Kuwait or to defeat Hitler, but you can't use it to destroy a political concept like terrorism or to turn a poor, backward country into a functioning democracy. That kind of warfare is incapable of achieving a goal, so obviously it just keeps going on, it can't achieve a victory.</blockquote>

</div>Ehh.. Jihad is a means to an end, just like a military intervention is. The question is &quot;what end&quot;? If your goal is to attack every city in Europe and put all it's inhabitants to the sword, then radical Islam is obviously incapable of achieving that goal, so they will fail.<br />
If the goal of a Western intervention is &quot;Let them hold democratic elections where they freely elect someone who happens to be liked by us&quot; then the chances of that intervention succeeding aren't terribly big either.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Sure, I agree, but that's just a poor construction of logic there, which has nothing to do with the concept of warfare as a goal-accomplishment tool.  It's hard for ethnocentric upper-class Elites to even imagine that other people from other backgrounds could make free decisions that would legitimately serve their own purposes and yet would be different decisions than the Elites would have made themselves given the same choices.  It simply flabbergasts many American Elites that anyone would freely choose something other than Christianity-flavored Capitalism, because that's what works for them and they really don't understand diversity at all.</blockquote>
