Hey I understand if people are against spanking, but your rationale above makes no sense.  A 16-month-old is going to strike out because hey arms with things on the end of them and I'm angry.</div></div><hr />

Do you think all children naturally tend to behave like this kid and good parenting stops that?  Or do you think bad parenting created this kid?  I am not defending the kid (please don't put words in my mouth :) ); but I do feel sorry for him because I think its the later.  Some people in the thread think beating him would solve the problem.

Yes.  Children are wild animals, and only structure and discipline trains them otherwise.<br />

<br />
I do think bad parenting caused this but it probably wasn't from hitting him. The mother's reaction to getting slapped shows this. Corporal punishment only works if it isn't overused (then it does have the effect of breeding violence).<br />
<br />
What caused this was inconsistent parenting and the parent not establishing ground rules and then enforcing them. This let the kid take over. However, lets not excuse the child's behavior because of bad parenting. The kid is old enough to know what he is doing and his behavior is inexcusable regardless of the underline reasons for doing it.</div></div><hr />

Beating a child is not what I've been talking about at all.  This is a common problem I find with people who are against corporal punishment - they do not differentiate a soft bite that's just enough to register surprise and discomfort in a child with gnawing a finger off.<br />
<br />
Some people think the best way to raise a child is to try and relate with that child.  Some people think the best way to raise a child is to cause that child to live in fear of the parent.  There's middle ground.  And within that middle ground, every single child is different and must be raised as such.<br />

Well said - I wish I had put it this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think I'd bite a 16 month old that bit me once, and I don't think thats exactly what people are saying.<br />
<br />
While Ground rules and known expectations help, putting a kid in a corner and stressing him out on live t.v. is probably going to escalate his behavior.  Add to that women don't really know how to communicate with boys unless they've had a few brothers or sons already and you get a bad situation in any circumstances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 4 kids and they all went through the exact same phase between 2-3 yrs old where they would bite when they got frustrated. Now I personally didn't bite them back, but they were sternly disciplined for it. After several conversations with their pediatrician I think it is safe for me to say that biting is absolutely normal for all children.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree completely.<br />
<br />
Beating didn't get that kid to the point where he's TELLING his mother to shut up. Her actually shutting up as a part of the interaction, is a symptom of the problem.<br />
<br />
The problem? Piss poor parenting.<br />
<br />
You're looking at a kid who will have a wacked moral compass if he goes through life unchecked, and so far, it looks that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is one of the hardest things for me to get some people to understand.  A single form of dealing with behavioral problems is not going to be the best way to raise a child.  Using multiple forms for a variety of problems is the best way to go.<br />
<br />
Sometimes time-outs are the best response.<br />
Sometimes time-outs along with calm discussions are the best response.<br />
Sometimes you have to respond with a form of physical discipline.<br />
Sometimes you have to beat the snot out of the brats.<br />
Sometimes you have to tie them up, put a plastic bag over their head and secure it with a rubber band around the neck.<br />
Sometimes . . . oops.. I think I went a bit too far.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my first statement still stands.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I am all for the right level of punishment at the right time, but corporal punishment from the mother at this point is just a vain effort and will only give more reason for the boy to play the victim.  <br />
 <br />
The boy needs to be separated from the mother in to a very disciplinary oriented situation like military school.  If I was to ship the boy off to military school I would send a copy of the Dr. Phil ep with him so they knew excacly how the boy needed to be handled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anything strike you as odd in that clip? Granted I stopped watching the clip at 2:30.<br />
<br />
The mother's body language is almost submissive to the boy. When being confronted with an abuse charge, in front of &quot;dr.&quot; Phil and cameras, her response was close to being told &quot;that the laundry is dry.&quot; Next to nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Keep thinking whatever you do in your spare time is more important than raising your kid.  Make up for the guilt you feel by over-feeding him or her, and indulging his or her whims, no matter how irrational.  All problems on TV are solved in 22 minutes + commercials, so any interaction with children should be very brief and disjointed too.  Maybe with a laugh track.<br />
2. Be very inconsistent with discipline.  Use phrases like &quot;This is the last time or you're going to get it&quot; &quot;I mean it this time&quot; or &quot;Don't make me count to five&quot;.<br />
3. As a correlary, if you tell the kid the next time she does something you're turning around and going home, make sure to go to the zoo anyway because you don't want to waste your whole day.<br />
4. Curfews are for loosers, remember how you hated them?  After all, what could possibly go wrong at 1130 at night on some random street corner?<br />
5. Never get to know your kids' friends and their parents.  All other humans are faceless drones to you, why should these people be any different?<br />
6. A crying child means you're a bad, evil parent.  Panic in public and do whatever it takes to stop that child from crying.<br />
7. Never tell a kid why they're being punished, the nosey bastages.  And to keep them on their toes, give them time out one day and ground them for a month six weeks later for basically the same type of thing.<br />
8. Always discipline a child when angry.  After all, that's when the adrenaline is flowing, which by now is the only time you have the balls to get in his or her face.<br />
9. You're there to be your child's friend, not their parent.  We have school systems, prisons, and the military to raise your child.  Don't forget that respect is a one-way street going from you to your kid.<br />
10. Self-image is everything!  Your child is a unique snowflake that may melt under the pressure of the evil world and must be sheltered from all of it at all times except to be told that everything in it will be handed to him or her without any effort.<br />

I was reading an interesting newspaper article the other day about some psych research led by Walter Mischel showing that the ability of a 4 year old to delay gratification correlates far stronger with future professional success than IQ or any other measure.<br />
<br />
The test for 4-year olds is the 'marshmallow test' -- the child is given a choice between 1 marshmallow now or 2 marshmallows in 15 minutes (the particular candy doesn't matter!). They can change their mind at any time before the 15 minutes is up and have just 1. Kids who can wait for 2 marshmallows at 4 do far better in life by a variety of measures than those who don't, and the minority of successful adults who failed the test at 4 show much improved performance on adult measures of the ability to delay gratification.<br />
<br />
I can't find the article anywhere now though. :( google turns up some shorter articles on Mischel's work but not the massive piece I remember reading. I'll keep looking.</div></div><hr />

I guess growing up loving my mom the way I do, I would never do anything that hurt her or disappointed her.  I cannot fathom showing that kind of disrespect.  If my nephew or nieces ever behave like this, I worry what my brother would do to them..<br />

This pretty much went for me as well.  I also didn't fear my father.  I did fear doing something wrong and getting caught because my parents thoroughly believed in physical discipline coupled with taking away all the fun things that I had or did.</div></div><hr />

I had a healthy fear of my dad though.  I did things my mom asked me to out of devotion, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

My parents wielded a much more effective weapon. The Guilt Trip. God I hated that. Unfortunately, I was born with too much compassion so this worked very well. I doubt the guilt trip would be very effective against that kid, but it worked on me.</div></div><hr />

There was an article in this week's New Yorker (http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer) about it too. Pretty interesting.</div></div><hr />
