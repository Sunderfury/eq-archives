<br />
The phone is a Samsung Galaxy SII/Sprint Epic 4G Touch.<br />
<br />
My home wifi is set up with 128bit WEP security on channel 11, and I have no problems connecting.<br />
<br />
My office wifi is set up with 128-WEP on 9, and still no problems connecting.<br />
<br />
The phone will even pick up the free wifi at Starbucks, Panera, etc.<br />
<br />
But at m'Lady's house, the wifi I set up for her on channel 6 with 128bit WEP just doesn't seem to want to allow my phone to connect.<br />
<br />
I haven't rooted the phone.<br />
<br />
It happened with Android 2.3.4 and the new 2.3.6 update.<br />
<br />
WiFi is on.<br />
When I get into her house and use a data app (browser, market, etc) the wifi icon turns on briefly, displaying no bars (and if i'm looking at the Wireless Settings view off the Home screen, it shows &quot;scanning&quot; repeatedly) but then disappears while the 3G icon animates normally.<br />
<br />
I've ensured the wireless settings for the router are allowing more than 1 connection (her laptop is wireless and works just fine) but even standing arm's length from the router, the phone won't connect.<br />
<br />
I downloaded WiFi Analyzer and that shows a signal strength of between -40 and -60db in the rooms where I'd want to use it (bedroom, kitchen, living room) but I just can't seem to get a locked connection.<br />
<br />
I've done everything except reset the router to factory defaults.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
As a possibly related addition, I had the exact same problem with my Palm Pre in this house as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, all of those are password-protected so I can't even connect to them.</div></div><hr />

One possible workaround is to generate and put in the hex key instead of the plain text key.</div></div><hr />

Stop using deprecated wireless encryption? :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deprecated or not, why does it work for one (or more) APs, but not others?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Differences in the algorithm for calculating the WEP Hash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some APs implement 802.11 extensions that were a good idea at the time, but some newer devices just don't know how to talk to them. If the AP is an older one, that could explain it.</div></div><hr />

Whoa. Where'd you pick one of those up that recently?</div></div><hr />

The local B&amp;M store is only 15 minutes from my sister's house, so when I go over, I go over an hour or two early to shop ;)</div></div><hr />
