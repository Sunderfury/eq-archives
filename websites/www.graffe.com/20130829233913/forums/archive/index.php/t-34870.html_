I'm just curious if anyone knows whether or not WoW can be installed on a rig with Windows Server 2003 Standard (this is getting installed on a system so a group and I have access to sharepoint, sql 2k, etc...and lucky me I volunteered to use my system as the server). 
 
Now of course before I go ahead and wax my current install I'm just wondering if anyone knows of compatibility or issues with WoW and Server 2k3?" />

<br />
I am sure it might run, but I have never been crazy enough to try it - plus all our servers have $45 graphics cards that don't really do 3d worthy of gaming.</div></div><hr />

You will have to do a bit of work first, though.  The default install of 2K3 has a lot of the things you need to game turned off. Here (http://www.msfn.org/win2k3/)'s an article on turning a Server machine into a workstation.  The relevant items are on pages 6 and 7.</div></div><hr />
