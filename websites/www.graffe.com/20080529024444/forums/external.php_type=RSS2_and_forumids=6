			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Allow me to apologize up front for the length of this post.<br />
<br />
My son's school has a teacher who's job is reading and writing specialist. Basically she is responsible for making sure that the children are at the correct level and is supposed to work with those that are not. One of the assignments she has handed out to the students is a journal. They are given a specific topic to write about daily. Well my son has not completed any of the writing assignments for the last six days. Now I don't know if it's out of defiance, he's taken a strong disliking to Mrs. McSally this year, or just because he doesn't feel like doing it. <br />
<br />
Today my son came home with his regular homework assignment and six days worth of journal entries to do. He was told that if he doesn't get them done he will not be able to participate in the end of school year field day tomorrow. I asked my son if Mrs. M had been monitoring the progress of the journals over the course of the week. He said yes she had. I asked if she had told him to bring the unfinished work home and complete them as homework. He said no she just yelled at him for not doing the work and that was it. <br />
<br />
Now my problem with this is. if the work was so important that she felt he needed to complete all six assignments in one night or be deprived of field day, why didn't she send the work home on the days it was assigned? Why wait until the end of the week and send it all home en mass? <br />
<br />
I'm going to have my son complete the work over the course of the weekend. I'm going to be dropping my son and daughter off tomorrow at the school for field day and I will be having a chat with the principle. I've told my wife that if they insist on keeping him from participating in field day then I will just pull him out of school for the rest of the year. <br />
<br />
Am I off base here? What would you do?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Alright everyone, the old volunteer thread became a bit of a mess. I'm going to ignore all the volunteerings collected within its confines and start afresh.<br />
<br />
Here's my plan:<br />
<br />
<b>Anyone who actively wants to be a mod should volunteer himself in this thread. If you volunteered in the old thread you must volunteer again to be counted.</b> My intention is for everyone who volunteers here to be up for a vote later on in the process. If a ton of people volunteer we will come up with a way to narrow the field a bit, but we'll cross that bridge if and when we come to it.<br />
<br />
If you are kind of a little bit interested in being a mod, or if you are willing to be a mod if other people think you would make a good one hold off a bit. In a day or two I will post a new thread where people can nominate each other.<br />
<br />
After that I'll collect all the people who volunteered and all the top nominationgetters and we'll have our list of mods up for vote.<br />
<br />
Please, please, please keep discussion limited to <b>pertinent rules- and voting-related shit</b>. The other thread became unmanageable because people kept derailing it, so don't do that again.<br />
<br />
For Ro!</div>

				<b>'Horror frog' breaks own bones to produce claws</b><br />
<br />
&quot;Amphibian horror&quot; isn't a movie genre, but on this evidence perhaps it should be. Harvard biologists have described a bizarre, hairy frog with cat-like extendable claws.<br />
<br />
Trichobatrachus robustus actively breaks its own bones to produce claws that puncture their way out of the frog's toe pads, probably when it is threatened.<br />
<br />
David Blackburn and colleagues at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology, think the gruesome behaviour is a defence mechanism.<br />
<br />
The researchers say there are salamanders that force their ribs through their skin to produce protective barbs on demand, but nothing quite like this mechanism has been seen before.<br />
<br />
The feature is also found in nine of the 11 frogs belonging to the Astylosternus genus, most of which live in Cameroon.<br />
Instant weapon<br />
<br />
&quot;Some other frogs have bony spines that project from their wrist, but in those species it appears that the bones grow through the skin rather than pierce it when needed for defence,&quot; says Blackburn.<br />
<br />
At rest, the claws of T. robustus, found on the hind feet only, are nestled inside a mass of connective tissue. A chunk of collagen forms a bond between the claw's sharp point and a small piece of bone at the tip of the frog's toe.<br />
<br />
The other end of the claw is connected to a muscle. Blackburn and his colleagues believe that when the animal is attacked, it contracts this muscle, which pulls the claw downwards. The sharp point then breaks away from the bony tip and cuts through the toe pad, emerging on the underside.

<div style="display: none;">
 WASHINGTON - Former White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan writes in a new memoir that President Bush relied on an aggressive &quot;political propaganda campaign&quot; instead of the truth to sell the Iraq war, and that the decision to invade pushed Bush's presidency &quot;terribly off course.'<br />
ADVERTISEMENT<br />
<br />
The Bush White House made &quot;a decision to turn away from candor and honesty when those qualities were most needed&quot;  a time when the nation was on the brink of war, McClellan writes in the book entitled &quot;What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington's Culture of Deception.&quot;<br />
<br />
The way Bush managed the Iraq issue &quot;almost guaranteed that the use of force would become the only feasible option.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the permanent campaign era, it was all about manipulating sources of public opinion to the president's advantage,&quot; McClellan writes.<br />
<br />
White House aides seemed stunned by the scathing tone of the book, and Bush press secretary Dana Perino issued a statement that was highly critical of their former colleague.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House,&quot; she said. &quot;For those of us who fully supported him, before, during and after he was press secretary, we are puzzled. It is sad - this is not the Scott we knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perino said the reports on the book had been described to Bush, and that she did not expect him to comment. &quot;He has more pressing matters than to spend time commenting on books by former staffers,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
The book provoked strong reactions from former staffers as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;For him to do this now strikes me as self-serving, disingenuous and unprofessional,&quot; Fran Townsend, former head of the White House-based counterterrorism office, told CNN.<br />
<br />
Said former top aide Karl Rove, in an interview with Fox News Channel, &quot;If he had these moral qualms, he should have spoken up about them. And frankly I don't remember him speaking up about these things. I don't remember a single word.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard Clarke, another former counterterrorism adviser who also came out with a book critical of administration policy, said he could understand McClellan's thinking, however. Clarke told CNN that he, too, was harshly criticized, saying that &quot;I can show you the tire tracks.&quot;<br />
<br />
McClellan called the Iraq war a &quot;serious strategic blunder,&quot; a surprisingly harsh assessment from the man who was at that time the loyal public voice of the White House who had followed Bush to Washington from Texas.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Iraq war was not necessary,&quot; he concludes. &quot;Waging an unnecessary war is a grave mistake.&quot;<br />
<br />
McClellan admits that some of his own words from the podium in the White House briefing room turned out to be &quot;badly misguided.&quot; But he says he was sincere at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;When words I uttered, believing them to be true, were exposed as false, I was constrained by my duties and loyalty to the president and unable to comment,&quot; he said. &quot;But I promised reporters and the public that I would someday tell the whole story of what I knew.&quot;<br />
<br />
The former press secretary  the second of four so far in Bush's presidency  explained his dramatic shift from loyal defender to fierce critic as a difficult act of personal contrition, a way, he wrote, to learn from his mistakes, be true to his Christian faith and become a better person.<br />
<br />
&quot;I fell far short of living up to the kind of public servant I wanted to be,&quot; McClellan writes. He also blames the media whose questions he fielded, calling them &quot;complicit enablers&quot; in the White House campaign to manipulate public opinion toward the need for war.<br />
<br />
McClellan said Bush loyalists will no doubt continue to think the administration's decisions have been correct and its unpopularity undeserved. &quot;I've become genuinely convinced otherwise,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
The book is scheduled to go on sale June 1. Quotes from the book were first reported Tuesday night by the Web site Politico, which said it found McClellan's memoir on sale early at a bookstore.<br />
<br />
McClellan draws a portrait of Bush as possessing &quot;personal charm, wit and enormous political skill.&quot; He said Bush's record as Texas governor and &quot;disarming personality&quot; inspired him to follow him and that his administration early on possessed &quot;seeds of greatness.&quot;<br />
<br />
But, McClellan said, Bush's unwillingness to admit mistakes and belief in his own spin contributed to turning the president into &quot;not quite the leader I once imagined him to be.&quot; He faults Bush for a &quot;lack of inquisitiveness&quot; and &quot;a degree of self-deception that may be psychologically necessary to justify the tactics needed to win the political game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bush &quot;convinces himself to believe what suits his needs at the moment,&quot; McClellan writes. 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
I saw this earlier and thought it a bit odd that no one had posted it.<br />
<br />
1. Is this just someone writing a book for sensationalism to make a buck?<br />
2.  Is this just a disgruntled employee that is blowing things out of porportion?<br />
3.  Is this the truth and will just be ignored<br />
<br />
I think it is mostly true.  I've worked with people that can't stand to have anyone buy yes-men around them that are so cocky they buy into their own bullshit.  These people are extremely hard to work with, let alone work for.  <br />
<br />
I'm just so tired of the entire Bush Jr administration.  We could elect a pile of rocks and I'd welcome it solely for it not being Bush Jr.  I know the next administration is going to have its problems, but at some point a new problem is preferable.</div>

				Science probe for 'space pistols'  <br />
<br />
By Jonathan Fildes <br />
Science and technology reporter, BBC News  <br />
<br />
Given pride of place in an unassuming museum on the East Coast of America is a pair of 200-year-old duelling pistols shrouded in mystery. <br />
<br />
The intricately decorated guns were said to have been forged from the iron of a fallen meteorite. <br />
<br />
They were a unique gift from the commander of a South American region, which would later become Argentina, to the fourth US president, James Madison. <br />
<br />
&quot;Permit me therefore to present to your Excellency... a specimen of the first essays  of the manufacture of arms established in the provinces of Buenos Ayres and Tucuman,&quot; wrote General Ignacio Alvarez in an accompanying 14-page letter. <br />
<br />
Over time, they passed into the hands of Madison's successor - James Monroe - and are now on display at a museum dedicated to him. <br />
<br />
Since that time, the story of their origin has gone unquestioned. <br />
<br />
Now, scientists armed with a battery of hi-tech machines have probed the pistols in unprecedented detail. <br />
<br />
Their findings cast doubt on the accepted theory of their origins and have thrown up a whole new set of questions for historians about the guns and the motives of the original protagonists. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's made the mystery even more mysterious,&quot; Meghan Budinger, curator at the James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library, told BBC News. <br />
<br />
Atomic probe <br />
<br />
To uncover the secrets of the pistols, they were sent on a world tour of some of the most advanced microscopes and scanners.  HOW ISIS WORKS <br />
 <br />
Neutrons blasted at sample<br />
Neutrons created by accelerating protons to near light-speed<br />
Pulses of protons smash into block of tungsten, dislodging neutrons from the nuclei of its atoms. <br />
20,000 trillion neutrons dislodged each second<br />
Neutrons channelled into beams and directed at sample of interest<br />
Neutrons bounce off the molecular structure and collected by sensors which record position and energy<br />
Scattering tells scientists about how target atoms are organised <br />
<br />
They underwent X-ray fluorescence to reveal their surface detail, and were passed through a CT scanner to reveal their inner workings. <br />
<br />
But the key test - whether they were forged from a lump of metal from space - was performed at the ISIS neutron source in Oxfordshire, UK. <br />
<br />
The colossal machine is able to probe matter at the atomic level, giving scientists unique insights into the structure and make-up of materials. <br />
<br />
&quot;We give a different picture of what the world looks like,&quot; said Professor Andrew Taylor, director of ISIS. <br />
<br />
The facility, owned and operated by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), is currently being expanded to add the so-called Second Target Station, which will give the super-scope even more capability. <br />
<br />
It is more commonly used by scientists designing and testing new materials, such as those used in the Airbus A380 and the turbine blades found in Rolls Royce jet engines. <br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't set out to build a tool for archaeology,&quot; said Professor Taylor. <br />
<br />
However, its abilities are ideally suited to probing historical artefacts. <br />
<br />
&quot;What my neutron beams tell you are where atoms are and what atoms do,&quot; said Professor Taylor. &quot;We try to understand at a microscopic level the structure, arrangement and forces that hold materials together.&quot; <br />
<br />
Crucially, this process is non-destructive. <br />
<br />
&quot;Without [ISIS], we'd have to take a hacksaw and cut chunks out of the artefact to look at under the microscope,&quot; explained Dr Evelyne Godfrey, who carried out the study. <br />
<br />
'Funny stuff' <br />
<br />
The machine was used to compare Monroe's pistols to a fragment of a meteorite from the Campo del Cielo crater in Argentina; the supposed origin of the metals from which they were forged.  <br />
ISIS has been used to test and develop materials for the Airbus A380 <br />
<br />
The results were conclusive. <br />
<br />
&quot;They were completely different,&quot; Dr Godfrey told BBC News. &quot;There were differences in microstructures, there were differences in carbon content, there were differences in chemical composition. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can say for sure they weren't made from meteoritic iron.&quot; <br />
<br />
The results came as a blow to the museum. <br />
<br />
&quot;The results weren't quite what we were hoping,&quot; said Ms Budinger, diplomatically. <br />
<br />
But, whilst the tests closed one chapter for the pistols, it opened another, packed full of new questions. <br />
<br />
Curators of the objects had always assumed that the handles of the pistols were made of silver, but ISIS showed that this too was not the case. <br />
<br />
&quot;They were brass - and it was a funny type of brass, too,&quot; explained Dr Godfrey. <br />
<br />
The closest match was a distinctive alloy exported from Southeast Asia at around the time. <br />
<br />
&quot;It looks just like silver but is cheaper - so they were making tableware and replacing silver in other objects,&quot; said Dr Godfrey. <br />
<br />
Other tests revealed that the guns were not just ceremonial - as previously thought - but were fully functioning arms. <br />
<br />
Questions, questions <br />
<br />
&quot;It brings up all kinds of questions,&quot; said Ms Budinger. <br />
<br />
&quot;What exactly was General Alvarez's motivation? He wrote this very flowery letter saying how much he admired the United States and how much he admired Madison but then he gives them a gift that was not where he said it was from and it was made from cheaper materials.&quot; <br />
<br />
There is a possibility that the General was duped - that he was told the pistols were made of meteoritic iron and gifted them in good faith. <br />
<br />
&quot;He may not have known what he was giving to Madison - at the time there would have been no way to prove it one way or the other,&quot; said Ms Budinger. <br />
<br />
The partially solved mystery could stop there; but the research team have one further avenue to explore. <br />
<br />
A third pistol is mentioned in General Alvarez's letter that was also supposedly forged from Campo del Cielo iron. <br />
<br />
&quot;We're trying to track that down,&quot; explained Ms Budinger. <br />
<br />
If it is located and can be put through the same battery of tests as the first pair it could finally give historians clues to the real origin of the pistols. <br />
<br />
&quot;If it looks exactly the same that tells us that all three pistols were manufactured by the same person and that either General Alverez was duped or that it means he was lying and that none of the pistols were made from the Campo del Cielo crater. <br />
<br />
&quot;If the third pistol is different entirely then I think we have fairly good evidence that our pistols may not be the Madison pistols at all,&quot; said Ms Budinger <br />
<br />
&quot;In which case it's a whole new mystery.&quot;

<br />
1) The rules need a rewrite: There are some phrasing issues, and more importantly, I need to take another hash at some sort of civility rule. There have been arguments in favour of some sort of anti-disruption rule, and I want to see if I can formulate one that isn't hopelessly vague.<br />
<br />
2) Moderator policy: The purpose statement is fine, but I need to write some sort of guideline for how one goes about warning, banning, suspending, giving emergency time out suspensions, and what not. For at least a trial period we will be keeping the public 'justice' forum (lets find another name) and Goladus has written some excellent templates that we will use.<br />
<br />
3) Election procedure for moderators, terms, and so on.<br />
<br />
This is heavy travel season and I'm still a bit sick, combined with the weekend uproar it's just wearing me down atm, mea culpa for the delay.<br />
<br />
The plan at this point is to get something in place, let it run for a few months, and then come back again for more revisions if needed.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Finding another job isn't the answer, he is going to retire in 2 years max and I have been here 10 years.<br />
<br />
This morning, I went to a manager at work who usually organizes vacation time.  This manager can't approve my vacation time, only my boss who is a VP that we both report to can, but I wanted to make sure I'd have the time in October (Blizzcon) before I went to my boss who is usually very difficult.<br />
<br />
My boss overheard us and gave me the third degree for going to the manager.  He asked me why I did and I told him I wanted to get my ducks in a row before I officially asked for the time off.  He said, you know the vacation rules, again, &quot;why did you go to the manager&quot;.  I repeated my answer, &quot;I wanted to get my ducks in a row before I officially requested the time off&quot;. He then told me that he is going to take that week off so I can't.  I said, &quot;Ok, I guess I can't take the time off then&quot;.  He asked me again, for the third time, why did I go to the manager, I repeated my answer for the third time.  Then he said, &quot;I think you are lying, come up with a better story&quot;, and walked out of my office.<br />
<br />
I don't have a better story, that really was why I was talking to the other manager.  What other reason would there be to talk to this manager about it?  I can't even begin to figure out what he thinks I might be doing behind his back that he thinks I am lying over something so stupid as confirming that I indeed will have days accrued for vacation available in October.<br />
<br />
Edit: I know the title should be you're not your.  I wrote too fast and didn't proof read right off.</div>
