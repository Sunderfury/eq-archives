							Since this post seems to have gone a little downhill into class wars, I would like to toss a little bit of gas on the fire.<br />
<br />
Since necros and sorcs are hate capped in raids(although necros pets can do damage without counting twards their hate.) a class comparison really does have to take into account soloing ability. Otherwise it really is about how much utility a caster can add above DPS.<br />
<br />
As for psions we are not utility/DPS, I would put us more at utility/CC. Then with limited things that are mezable and limited things that can be petted all we become good for is buffs. As stated before a psion can pull agro off a tank just like any other caster, but we have to use our self depreciating abilities to do so, and as opposed to a sorc we do not get equitable returns for our trouble. <br />
<br />
So in conclusion, what's a psion's role? Nobody knows. Why is everyone creating a necro? Because they still have the same DPS cap in raid, but you can solo your way to 50 quickly. <br />
<br />
As for the content being the problem not the class, damn straight. A 5 dot mob that is imune to mez and charm should not be frearable. Same is true with a non creature class mob. But right now there are mobs I can't pet, but my wife can fear them all day long. Add that to the ability to life tap mobs, a permanent pet, and FD. So yes, the content needs to be fixed, but so does the class, otherwise might as well fill every raid caster role with necros (because they can keep themselves healed) and then just use the other classes for group 4.<br />
<br />
Sorry Druids, dunno what to tell you. <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Frown" class="inlineimg" /><br />
<br />
Edit: Oh and for the record, before it comes up: Psion pets do less damage than necro pets when the necro pet is well augmented. Also ours can't be sacrificed for health, and they have this nasty habit of turning on us at bad times and killing us. Oh and if they have the augmentation which give the abomination health for damage dealt they can tank 3 dot mobs themselves. Sorry, but this doesn't seem even remotely balanced.

							I will hold my tounge on psionicists until we hear more about what the devs plan on actually &quot;doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering they will be dealing damage under rogues but higher than monks and rangers, i dont think they will be &quot;bad&quot; at dps at all in a raid, but rather that they will indeed be more &quot;bard like&quot; in that they add more dps &quot;though&quot; their allies by vastly improving caster dps and possibly lowering their hate be REALLY large amounts to enable them to &quot;deal&quot; this higher damage with less risk.<br />
<br />
If psionicists have access to this kind of potiental, and its kept &quot;same group only,&quot; then they will be just as adventageous as a bard on raids when it comes to be a dps nessessity almost for casters, and hopefully bard's buffs are changed to only effect melee classes for the most part.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is the BIGGEST flaw that i've noticed with buffing, are the + damage buffs.<br />
<br />
They are all damage.<br />
<br />
Not melee specific, not ranged specific, not spell specific.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see no reason why a cleric's Strength of the Gods should effect spell damage in any way, nor a bard song that is essentially rallying the strength of your comrads in combat (note, im not talking about the obvious caster-themed componants, but the &quot;war song&quot; type componants)<br />
<br />
I see no reason why a &quot;jolt&quot; symbiote should effect casters, how is this little angery attatchment going to make you strike twice with your spells?<br />
<br />
<br />
A cleric should not be a good addition to a caster dps group, their buffs should not be hugely beneficial for that.<br />
<br />
A bloodmage SHOULD be a good addition to a caster dps group, and their buffs should be geared towards such.<br />
<br />
<br />
If buffs are ever moved to a most restricted rout, such as same group only, then they all need serious review, and damage modification buffs especially need to only effect the damage than makes since.<br />
<br />
A war cry/song/frenzy should not effect spell damage, just as spell damage boosting abilities should not effect melee damage.<br />
<br />
I think this could really even up the buffing-capability of many classes if they introduce new buffs to classes that currently are lack luster in that area (only when it make since though) by diverging the general &quot;damage&quot; buffs.<br />
<br />
Psionicists, Bloodmages, Phoenix shamans and Dreadknights would obviously be the prime canidates for Spell damage enhancement, while Disciples, Clerics (more so in war clerics), Bear shamans, Bards and Warriors would be the prime canidates for Melee damage enhancement.<br />
<br />
Bards should be the strongest enhancer for melee, with Psionicist's being the strongest enhancer for spells, while each is mildly acceptable at the other role. (some melee haste for psions, some energy cost reductions ect for bards so they can still help the opposite damage types out a bit)<br />
<br />
The rest can just fall in how the devs see fit, the general rule being the more damage you do personally, the less you buff up in your group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And there is my hypothetical conversation tome of the evening, time to waste 2 hours of my life reading a 1900's Humanities novel <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra </i>....

							Chayce, You acknowledge it yourself that its a problem with the mob not the class, so why claim the class needs fixing?<br />
<br />
I'll say it again, if you atempt to acheive pure soloing balance amongst all classes then you end up with a game that in reality has one generic class with lots of different names.<br />
I'd prefer diverse classes with flavor, and if that means having a Necro that can easily solo 4dot Generic_mob#523's all day long i dont really care, cause the class i play can do neat stuff that necro never could.<br />
If the whole premise of your post was to say Psi's are lacking in neat abilities, then just say it rather than justify the need with crap about what necro's solo. <br />
<br />
VG is supose to be fun, with cool classes that do neat stuff, so why would you even need to justify giving a class something neat?

</div>I think this has more o do with the game being initially designed around grouping, with the so called 20% raiding content not making it into the game till a year after release...<br />
Makes sense to have damage buffs apply to all damage types if you want to limit the &quot;Melee DPS Group looking for healer, must be Cleric&quot; / &quot;Caster group looking for more, bards need not apply&quot; syndrome.<br />
Not saying its right one way or the other, but a likely reason why 'all damage' buffs were put in the game rather than splitting suport classes into archetype specific roles e.g. eq2 with TroubvsDirge.

							Yes it is a mob problem, but it is a class problem. If Necros can solo better than any other casters, and casters in raid are more usefull if they can keep themselves alive without assistance(cough cough necros) then what are necros bad at and why do we keep the other casters around?<br />
<br />
If we had one healer that could raid heal, single target heal, had good buffs, and could solo well why would anyone play annother class of healer?<br />
<br />
Yes psions lack any usefull neat abilities at high levels, yes that is why I am upset, but you can't deny that the server necro population are huge compaired to other casters and I still see raid guilds specificly recruiting necros but I have never seen a raid guild recruiting psions or druids.<br />
<br />
If the game is just about cool classes doing neat stuff, then balancing class abilities should be key. I'm glad necros can't mez, rez, or heal otherwise they might be really overpowered. Wait they can. <br />
<br />
And if the class you play Code can do things a necro never could, then please clue me in, are you a bard? I think it will be at least a couple more patches before necros can play music. Maybe you have a tank, then you can get beat on more than a necro ever could.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for bashing on one class in particular, but I have seen what a necro can do. I have a necro alt just because being an overpowered character is really fun, and if I work half as hard at playing my necro as I did on my psion its a piece of cake. At the end of the day though, I would like casters to be balanced in usefullness and enjoyment to play, and right now that is a far way off.

</div>We have them because once these balancing passes are finished, the &quot;best&quot; dps should come from having one of EACH caster present in the raid force, rather than stacking multiples.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorcerers should deal the best over time and direct damage, but with out the other 3 casters, they will miss crucial buffs, hate mitigation, and debuff that would be avalible.<br />
<br />
Necromancer should be close behind sorcerers when comparing over time damage, and they will offer good buffs and debuffs for everyone to benefit from.<br />
<br />
Druids should be close behind sorcerers when comparing max DPS capability, and should also bring buffs/debuffs that improve the over all dps of the raid.<br />
<br />
Psionicists should be a fair distance behinds sorcerers in max dps as well as over time dps, to the extent of how a bard is behind a ranger, but they should have the most potient spell-damage-boosting effects in the game, meaning that any group that is set up for spell dps will do better with a psionicist than with replacing them with a multiple of an existing class.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aka:<br />
<br />
Sorc / Sorc / Sorc / Sroc should be less dps than Sorc / Psion / Druid / Necro.<br />
<br />
<br />
More so, any multiples of a class should be less effective than diversity when it comes to total damage brought to the raid:<br />
<br />
Sorc x4 &lt; sorc x3 + druid / necro / psion <br />
<br />
Or any multiples.<br />
<br />
four of the same class should be weaker, when gear and skill are equal, should always be weaker than even the substitution of just one different class*<br />
<br />
This excludes &quot;specific&quot; fights in which one class might have a huge advantage, like double damage on a particular Element they are strong in, like a double-arcane damage mob, x4 sorcerers would be strong, though the addition of a psionicist would still produce more total dps than just adding an extra sorcerer, and likely the same would be true for a druid as well)

	</div>
</div>My sig normally gives away what class I play... but incase that didn't show up, cause sometimes it doesn't, I play a Sorc. <br />
As for the things my Sorc can do that a Necro can't well I can... <br />
kill mobs much faster than an equivalent Necro (a main reason i play my class)<br />
nuke from 36m range<br />
AE mez where Necro only can single target mez<br />
solo AE kite literaly infinate numbers of mobs at once with AE snares and AE nukes, where a Necro can fear kite maybe max 3 mobs at once if there good.<br />
make my self/group/targetsgroup compleately immune to any spell damage type for short periods (assuming its not a curse <img src="images/smilies/mad.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Mad" class="inlineimg" /> )<br />
<br />
Thats just off the bat, and mostly solo focused, but like my point, it gets back to the class having a different feel and playstyle. If you were to REALLY ballance solo play, so that everything a necro can do solo, every other class can do solo, then you WILL end up with one class that has every ability in the game... and that's a game I would not pay to play.<br />
<br />
Another point, I never said it is ideal to have half or more arcane casters on any server as Necro's, but what i am saying is don't complain about there abilities, its what makes necro's, well, necro's. Fear is a perfectly fine ability, within limits. (and yes they may need to tighten those limits somewhat, on that i agree)<br />
<br />
If you look at why people like playing Necro's and blame the lack of Psi's on that, then by proxy your saying &quot;Necro's are too cool, make them crapper&quot;. But if you look instead at the lack of an equivalent reason to play the Psi, or Druid, or any other class, then you are by proxy saying, &quot;My class lacks coolness, fix it please&quot;. And of the two aproaches i bet you get a better response, and ultimately better outcome, with the latter.<br />
<br />
As a Sorc I often contribute ideas with my fellow Sorc on how my class could be made more special, complaining about what makes other classes special, is not the best way to make the game better. If anything it just encourages the devs to make the game crappier.<br />
<br />
and finally, to refute one of your assertions... Necro's can NOT solo better than any other arcane caster, period. They can solo CERTAIN CONTENT better than any other arcane caster, which imho is fine assuming thats the intent of the Devs.<br />
<br />
In summary, blame the content not the class.<br />
<br />
Cheers

							Alright, have to come in and step on the caster's toes.  Jades actually asked me here to discuss a rogue's view here.  Kardolmer is the class lead, but he's a slacker.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's what I see.  Sorcs and Rogues should be top DPS. Period.  All we do is DPS.  We bring nothing else to raiding.  Ruin (our debuff) is -14% damage, and -16% accuracy.  It apparently is stacking when it shouldn't, so... don't count on it.<br />
<br />
Sorcs should have a HUGE burst DPS advantage over us, and we should have the long haul DPS.  You guys have the range advantage, and we eat the AEs.  Talking to Jades, apparently you eat AEs too, which should change.  Give you longer range (hell, all casters) to avoid the AE.<br />
<br />
My current reason I out DPS you guys is due to hate management.  You need SOMETHING to help you out, cuz right now you have nothing.  It's useless and broken.  But, high DPS should equal high risk.  My risk right now is too low, and yours is too high.  Monks with FD have even less risk, heh.  Something should be done to address all these issues.<br />
<br />
I don't think a druid should out DPS me, and unless it's a SUPER long fight, a necro shouldn't either.<br />
<br />
So, nutshell:  Sorcs shouldn't be higher than rogues.  Right now, you ARE, but you have no hate management.  Doh.  It needs to equal out in the end.  I don't think you should be at 4000, and us at 3500 - higher risk = higher reward (DPS).  This should be balanced, without anyone being nerfed.

							Nothing should come close to Rogue/Sorcerer at best 90% (hello broken monks).<br />
Its what we were build for, destroying stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most intelligent sorcerers (jades illusive code me &amp; a few more) around lvl30 would have<br />
told you they'd exept to be 2nd DPS in raids, just behind rogues.<br />
<br />
Why ? Because the class was fundamentally unkillable by spells (Immunity from  Wards)<br />
And we all knew there would be a price to pay for that.<br />
<br />
Things have changed a lot, now i get hit by everything, and have 3K hp less than a rogue.<br />
Not to mention that i spend a huge amount of time dispelling GE (on GCD unlike counterspell).<br />
Did i mention i need healing to DPS ? Even if i dont take AE/DoT dmg ? (CV powa).<br />
<br />
My &quot;Vision&quot; is :<br />
-&gt; No AE, No GE = Sorcerer <br />
-&gt; No AE, GE = Sorcerer     <br />
-&gt; AE, No GE = Rogue        <br />
-&gt; AE, GE = Rogue            <br />
<br />
When i talk about AE i mean &quot;real nasty shit&quot; 3K+ AEs which makes using CV dangerous.<br />
Yes i know BM can heal us for free, and many classes have HoT's.<br />
Still getting 2x 700 Feedbacks (w/o critic) should be a self-limiting factor.<br />
<br />
For a &quot;real example&quot; on Chrylakis Rogues would come on top.<br />
Since we have to Dispell GE (4-8 sec per GE)<br />
then have to come in melee for the AE Mez thingy (no distance aggro reduction)<br />
And cant use CV because his &quot;flechette&quot; deals 5K (so no CV thus Taq+ForceB)<br />
<br />
On Vicus, if you can time your CV, to have 9 10 11 12 13 14 land during<br />
the weakness, sorcerer should own rogues really hardcore.<br />
<br />
On Zaraax it will be tied, with maybe a rogue advantage (see endurance &amp; burst).<br />
<br />
On Senator, its not comparable, since we're here to kill the adds.<br />
<br />
On Silius, its obvious our AE's will put us on top (with enough mana regen).<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically depending on the mob/setup the top spot will be shared.<br />
<br />
PS : Melees will always have the 15sec Burst Advantage because of the way endurance works.<br />
This may change with the BurnStance but i doubt that much.

							*shrug*<br />
<br />
Doesnt matter what we feel should be the DPS ladder, its going to have casters at the top, with the exception of the psionicist being under the rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are plenty of reasons as to &quot;why&quot; this is im sure, and we could speculate about it all day, but thats probably such a fundamental design, with all the changes currently being designed, that they cannt just reverse that decision.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogues actually offer quite a bit to a raid imo, at least i certainly notice their contributions.<br />
<br />
The raid wide +4% crit is nice, as are their debuffs to an extent, and Imperil is amazing.<br />
<br />
I would say that a rogue most certainly &quot;contributes&quot; more dps to the raid than a druid or sorcerer does. Contributes defined as your buffs and debuffs that facilitate damage, of which a sorcerer has none, and the druid has a minor str/dex/haste componant on wolf form as well as their procs, and a resistance debuff on their dot, and thats it.<br />
<br />
The actual &quot;DPS&quot; your character does is important, but its not the only factor.<br />
<br />
If your presence and debuffs improve each person's individual dps by even as little as +100 dps, multiply that by 17 people and toss that on to your personal dps, and look how that stacks up.<br />
<br />
I would definatly venture a guess that the druid's resistance debuff, and minor stat buffs, and proc add less dps than a rogues +4% crit and imperil.

							See, the whole &quot;it's been decided so oh well&quot; mentality is bad.  You have a class lead here (Jades) working with you to improve your class.<br />
<br />
He and I are guildmates, and as much as EVERY class lead wants their class to be the best - we both agree that Sorcs shouldn't out DPS rogues, and vice versa.<br />
<br />
There HAS to be a balancing factor.  Risk vs Reward.  As it stands, Monks should out DPS EVERYONE due to no agro issues.  Rogues are higher because we simply do more damage, and have next to no agro issues.  Sorcs, unfortunately, have agro issues galore.<br />
<br />
My Risk is that I eat every AE.  Jades is telling me you guys do too, which...  seems odd, that is the benefit of being a ranged class.  I think they are trying to avoid the whole &quot;ranged &gt; melee&quot; aspect that EQ had (aka, rangers were better than rogues for a while, due to equipment, ranged, and no agro).<br />
<br />
Honestly, I have NO issue with sorcs being higher DPS than me, if they suffer similar drawbacks.  My drawback is that I am 2m from the mob, MAX 5m, but with hitboxes, and all that - that never happens.  You are 25m away.  Well, I have gift of peace, you don't.  Meh.  Psis should have a comparable caster buff like pallies have for us.  I think you'd pass rogues in DPS if just THAT change happened.<br />
<br />
As I said, I don't agree with the whole &quot;casters &gt; melee&quot; - if that is the case, why bring melee to a raid?  Damage shields then become meaningless.  All that matters is the tank, the healers, and caster DPS.  My debuff doesn't cut out the raw DPS potential of a sorceror with NO risk.<br />
<br />
So, all I am saying, as a raiding rogue, is that equal risk should have equal rewards.  Your risk right now is WAY higher than mine.  Fix that, and nothing else has issues.  I don't think nerfing rogues or monks is the way to go.  Particularly with whatever they change to make melee haste worth something, which is going to boost us even further.  Honestly, I am thinking they take autoattack off the global timer.  If that happens, my DPS will simply skyrocket, but so will the tank's ability to hold agro.  The tank holding agro better helps all of us.  Talisker gave us rogues what we have because we were falling behind the other melee classes.  Now we're going to be second rate to casters, because Avair thinks we're &quot;too good.&quot;  Something's not right here.

Now we're going to be second rate to casters, because Avair thinks we're &quot;too good.&quot;  Something's not right here.</div>

<br />
To level out rogues and sorcs remove your 4% crit buff the raid gets.<br />
<br />
Bring our aggro management up to yours and then we are equal.  <br />
<br />
Your 4% crit buff taken over the entire raid is bloody huge dps increase unless we ignore that.<br />
<br />
i guess the big question is do you consider this 4% part of your dps??? cause you really should.<br />
<br />
Sorcs do NOTHING to increase dps for other classes. 0 zilch<br />
<br />
Do not forget this fact when you think our dps should not be higher.

							Oh, and another point I would like to add, =&gt;As I told you, we get hit most of the time by AoE, and the fact that no-buff, we have around 3k hp (5-6-7k hp with buffs) make us way more vulnerable then rogue, so their is our risk!<br />
<br />
And, when we use CV, if we crit the feedback on us + get hit by the AoE... we have alot of risk to die.<br />
<br />
So yeah, reward should = risk, and we already have plenty of things going against us, that's why we have to be at top in term of personal dps.

							As I said, you shouldn't be hit by AE.  That's kinda the point.  You are a ranged class, your benefit is avoiding stuff like that.  That's why you have less HP, less AC, etc.  I agree 100% on that.<br />

The crit feedback on CV is part of the risk to equal your DPS.  It shouldn't be in addition to AEs, etc.<br />

You honestly think that a 4% crit increase for the raid is THAT high?  I mean, seriously.  DKs give what, 15%?  We get that ability at level 10.  It's not gamebreaking by any stretch.  Yes, it's a new ability, but it starts at 4%, and stays at 4%.  If we count &quot;added DPS&quot; as a basis of class DPS, then bards are blowing away EVERY class EVER.

And as I said, I have no issue with you doing 4000 DPS to my 3500 DPS.  If your risk matches mine, then boom, go for it.  I disagree with the concept behind it - caster &gt; melee is a bad concept, there should be equality.  I have a few more HP because I eat AEs.  You should be out of their range, and that is where the equality lies.  We should be similar in DPS.

	</div>
</div>I guess this is where we differ in our opinons.  <br />
<br />
We are pure dps....we do not add any dps to any other class.<br />
<br />
4% crit no offense is a big deal, we do not add dps to anyone we are dps.<br />
<br />
And yes bards add huge dps to others...but they do not do dps like rogues and sorcs...that is the difference.<br />
<br />
rogue an sorc = dps, your dps is also the 4% whether you want to admit it or not.<br />
<br />
I know i am happy to get 4% crit..hell i would take that buff in a sec without hesitation lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
risk vs reward is a whole diff story, i am just finding it funny that 4% crit is not being taken into the equation.

							Some people simply wont grasp certain concepts, such as personal dps + provided dps = net dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bards, in a since, as well as a clerics to a degree, are overpowered in the shear amount of damage they can bring to a raid by their inclusion.<br />
<br />
+50% damage is a serious amount, and the fact that with just bard and cleric buffs alone more than doubles my dps as a disciple should be fact alone that they are plain and simply contributing a tad too much.<br />
<br />
Heck, as a disciple i would be THRILLED if i could just use my bonds to improve ONE person's dps by 40%, much less improving an entire group's dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Balance is such a tricky issue though.<br />
<br />
Obviously you dont want to &quot;nerf&quot; (god i hate that word) bards to a point where they are undesirable for their primary purposes, which is to enhance melee dps classes, but in the same respect you dont want them to be so powerful that they are almost required to deal with encounters that are balanced TO the amount of dps they provide.<br />
<br />
If a raid with 3 bards can provide on average enough damage to slay a foe in a certain time limit, and this becomes the &quot;norm&quot; for developers, then the majority of 'difficult&quot; content will be designed to be killed in this fast time limit.<br />
<br />
If a raid is balanced to have one or no bards expected, then the addition of one or multiple bards might make killing the foe in the alloted time highly trivial.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway im getting off topic.<br />
<br />
<br />
They topic we should be focused on is this:<br />
<br />
<br />
ALL damage-based classes are comprised of two generalized methods-<br />
<br />
1.) Damage Generater.<br />
<br />
This is the actual damage production, your personal dps. <br />
<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
2.) Damage Enabler.<br />
<br />
This is the damage augmentation via buffs and debuffs that strongly influences the generated damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When classes are truely balanced, with the case of 4 classes, you should find the following to be true:<br />
<br />
You have one class priamrily devoted to Damage Generation with highly limited damage enabling.<br />
<br />
2 classes that are some where in the middle, generally being heavy on Damage Generation, with one focusing on &quot;enhancing&quot; and the other on &quot;enfeebling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally you have one class that is strongly focused on Damage Enabling and mediocre at Damage Generating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By combining all four methods, you achieve the HIGHEST possible net gain in terms of dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That means that if the Rogue is ment to be the &quot;top personal dps,&quot; then they should be limited in the extent of how they can improve other classes.<br />
<br />
Rangers should be close to a rogues &quot;fast&quot; dps, and should be able to spike higher than monks, and aid in damage Enabling by buffing their allies, which they do very well actually.<br />
<br />
Monks should be close to a rogue's sustain dps, and should be able to keep a high, constant dps that superceeds the ranger. They should focus on Damage Enabling by weakening their foes, allowing every to strike them harder (initially the weakness system was to be their method)<br />
<br />
Bards should be noticably below the other 3 fighters in spike and sustained dps, which i believe everyone can agree they are, and they should both enhance allies and weaken foes well enough to strongly influence the damage of their allies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally think bards make a bit too much of a difference, to the point that &quot;not&quot; having a bard is just plain stupidity. They should make a noticable difference, but their absence should not be the downfall of a raid; we are not to have any &quot;required&quot; class in any point in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The exact same applies to casters, just replace rogue with sorcerer, Ranger with druid, monk with necromancer, and psionicist (post revamp hopefully, NOT the current form) with Bard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for &quot;why&quot; a caster would have a higher damage potiential than a melee class, some reasons that i could rationalize, but which would need to be made more of an issue in a raiding enviornment:<br />
<br />
1.) Survivability. <br />
<br />
I APPROVE of having aoes that effect the whole raid. Silencing, spell reflecting, high resistance, LONG ranger aoes that dont effect people near the foe, and other such anti-ranged tactics should be on more foes. For every foe that is &quot;deadly&quot; to melee people, their needs to be an antithesis for ranged fighters. IMO range should not equal safety, as that creates imbalances. <br />
<br />
Why should a ranged player need defense or health if their distance is their ultimant defense, would that not allow them to focus on more offensive gear that would placed them far beyond a melee character who has to have some health and resists since they dont have that &quot;distance safey?&quot;<br />
<br />
2.) Limited Resource Management.<br />
<br />
A melee class should rarely, if ever, need to worry about &quot;running out&quot; of anything, but it should not be so for Casters/Ranged dps classes.<br />
<br />
While a Caster may have more damage POTIENTAL than a melee class, they should be limited by the amount of energy avalible to them.<br />
<br />
Here is where, imo, we have issues currently. Casters can reach HUUUUGE levels of energy, even while primarily focusing on heavy dps gear, to the point where they can say to hell with being efficient, im going to go full force 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
Casters need a reason to want to be efficient, thats the problem.<br />
<br />
Sorcerers using their efficient mode, and Necromancers using their more or less normal damage methods should be able to maintain their damage almost infinantly, while druids and psionicists should be able to maintain a moderate dps while trying to be efficient as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A melee dps class should deal MORE damage than a caster thats fighting efficiently.<br />
<br />
BUT, when the need calls for it, the Caster should have the ability to &quot;rank up&quot; the damage at the cost of losing that infinant sustainability, thus known as &quot;the burn.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That right there is how you actually balance casters and melee damage in vanguard.<br />
<br />
Melee classes should be able to start out early in a fight doing strong, consistant damage over time, and while able to spike their damage a bit, they should have less &quot;max&quot; potiential than comparitive casters.<br />
<br />
Caster classes should be forced to have to fight efficiently or run the risk of droping to zero dps once their energy is gone from burning. Until their is a need for casters to fight efficiently, and if they are indeed designed in the up coming Revamps to have higher maximum potientials than Fighters, then there will indeed be little need for Fighter dps, except in &quot;specific&quot; fights where spell-based damage doesnt work well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, once a caster starts out lower, then ramps up higher in terms of dps when compared to a Fighter, they should balance out as equals once things are said an done.<br />
<br />
<br />
If a sorcerer in their &quot;efficient&quot; form starts out for the first 60 seconds of a fight doing 1500 dps while a rogue deals a constant average of 2000 dps, and then the sorcerer swaps to their burn form and starts to deal 2400 dps for 2 minutes and the fight is over, the total dps &quot;average&quot; for the sorcerer is 2033 dps, while the rogue has maintained a constant 2100 dps average, giving a slight ~ 5% advantage to a sorcerer.<br />
<br />
A sorcerer should be out of energy after a solid two minute straight burn, in which case they need to use GE or a shard to recover, both options that are limited and not always avalible, so in prolonged fights, fighters definatly would have an advantage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It all depends on what buffs they want to stack and how well they stack. Obviously the necroamcner's % based buff is part of a larger problem with casters having dispropotionally huge energy pools, but several other factors come into play as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Until casters are limited more so by their energy pool, efficiency has no real noticable merit in their tactics, which means they are only limited by hate caps, which are likely to be &quot;fixed&quot; with in the next two game updates i would hope, which then leaves casters unchecked, free to deal more dps in almost all occasions than melee dps, basically a role reversal from what is currently in place.

							I've never asked for any class in VG to be nerfed, and I find focusing on the 'grass is greener' approach to be counter productive, but I do know that the risk of most caster classes is higher than the risk of most melee classes in end game currently, and yet the DPS potential seems to almost be the inverse.<br />
<br />
Casters do eat AE's, have less hps than melee and often burn hp to do there best dps, as either direct damage or canibalising health for energy.<br />
To compound this, in most raid fights 100 caster damage = ~ 80 hate at max range where 100 melee dps = ~65 hate at 3m...<br />
<br />
The problem imo lies in two primary issues.<br />
1) Agro management - We've talked about it at large, and simply casters lack the ability to manage there agro and keep up dps at the same way that melee can. Reasons for this are both Melee getting multiple % based hate reduction abilities where casters get static hate reduction AND Melee getting more/stronger hate reduction options than casters.<br />
<br />
2) Buff Stacking - Damage buffs generaly stack better with melee than with casters. Casting time of spells should mean fewer but bigger hits, however +damage buffs for melee affect pasive 'auto-attack' as well as special instant abilities. This means that melee get more damage from a static damage buff like those of bards which add +# damage rather than +% damage. <br />
<br />
Its pretty simple math, and could be easily ballanced if +melee damage and + spell damage buffs were seperated, but there not and because of this these a +100 damage buff can mean a difference of +100 * 2 autoattacks *1.5 per 3 sec + 100 * 2 per 3 sec for 2 special attacks VS +100 for 1 spell per 3 sec... in that example its a 5:1 damage ratio in favor of melee on # damage buffs.<br />
<br />
Both of these issues are due to an oversight in the use of static vs scaled abilities and could be avoided by re-desiging the abilities with a more wholistic view of the &quot;DPS meta-archetype&quot; (meaning both melee and ranged)<br />
<br />
I just hope they 'get it' sooner rather than later, because right now I'm quite over VG. We have way over-worked devs and no real commitment by SoE to get the game where it should be. There too busy trying to make the newbie experience good and fixing end game is not a real priority as a consequence. Its unlikely this imo 'huge imbalance' will be resolved before July... given that Psi re-vamp isn't even included in end Feb GU4 acording to January Producers letter, Heck I will be plesantly shocked if they finaly get this sorted out by GU8... which would make it about in time for next christmas, maybe by then I will decide to play again. /sigh

We benefit from everyone's increasers.<br />
And have GODLY spell defense (wards are insane outside APW).<br />

PS : I'm quite happy with our dps (for a non broken heavily nerfed class).<br />
Now i didnt get any resists (i often get 2 per CV Run), but thats 13 &quot;normal&quot; casts for me (raid+bard).<br />
My main grief is the healing required + aggro related to &quot;CV Spam&quot;<br />

							Rofl Code i've been saying that since Beta3!<br />
<br />
Skip to the very bottom if you want to find out how our spells are flawed at the base level, not just because of how the damage is calculated, but because of how they scale with Ranks vs a real spell scaling system (that is quite easy to set up). Read the section after the <font color="red">RED </font>text inorder to see my example of how &quot;scaling&quot; inbetween  the &quot;ranks&quot; of spells would allieviate several of our issues with some spells becoming &quot;hardly worth using&quot; inplace of others. Taqmirs and Char are weaker than several 50 spells simply because they have had a few levels in which their base damage is NOT improved with out level, hence especially why char is weak in the end game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the direct issue of caster-melee imbalances when it comes to damage scaling:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Their abilities factor in their weapon/str as part of their base damage, and str adds a static amount onto their attack, which is then modified by their attacks when are % of attack + static, or attack + static, and only in the case of Monk's Kick skills and melee based  DOTS are the attacks actually static.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MY disciple unbuffed has an attack of around 1000, with proper buff stacking, i can raise this to over 2500.<br />
<br />
My finishers calculate damage as 400% + static value, so you can see where that starts to compound quickly, especially with my high chance of critical hits, which also add more damage based on the base value.<br />
<br />
<br />
Intelligence is the only thing that effects base damage for casters, everything else then modifies the base damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Untill they change all caster-heald items to have a &quot;spell attack&quot; value and chance spells for casters to be &quot;300% of spell attack&quot; that is then modified by other stuff, casters will always lag behind in &quot;upgradability&quot; of their dps, and their spells will never retain the type of &quot;consistancy&quot; that melee attacks currently have (things such as always knowing X attack will be a certain amount stronger tha Y attack regardless of my level or Rank)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Example, lets look at what they intend the base damage of one of our nukes to currently be, lets say they want a base damage of 4000 damage on Seradon.<br />
<br />
<br />
To work with that,  lets say they expect Seradon to be 800% spell attack rating to calculate the damage.<br />
<br />
Intellegence, in its new form, would add a straight amount of damage onto your spell attack.<br />
<br />
Using what ever value they expect the current &quot;100%&quot; base line to be at level 50 is what they would establish as the &quot;base line&quot; for how much intell is going to add to Spell Attack, lets say its +300 spell attack for now.<br />
<br />
A &quot;common&quot; spell attack rating on Common quality staff at level 50 might be around +200 spell attack, with a increased damage on spell critical hits due to being a two hander.<br />
<br />
So the weapon's damage + intell boost = a 500 spell attack rating.<br />
<br />
This spell now works its value off of this, meaning 800% of 500 = 4000 &quot;base&quot; damage if using the crappy gear of green quality with &quot;base&quot; intell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, lets translate this to a caster who has a substantial amount of intell, and a very nice ultra rare crafted staff:<br />
<br />
The spell damage rating on this staff might be 280 now, and the boosted attack from intell might be 500 now, resulting in a spell attack of 780, multiple this by 800% for the spell, and your seradons falling star would hit for 6240.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Then once you start getting other buffs involved, these numbers start to grow even higher.<br />
<br />
<br />
For a melee class interested in daamge, you need only worry about 6 things:<br />
<br />
Weapon<br />
Str<br />
Dex<br />
+ Melee damage.<br />
+ mele crit<br />
+ melee accuracy<br />
<br />
(for survivability to sustain this damage in range of foes)<br />
Health, optional con.<br />
<br />
For a caster class interested in damage, you need only worry now about 6 things:<br />
<br />
Weapon<br />
Int<br />
Wisdom<br />
+ Spell damage rating.<br />
+ spell critic<br />
+ spell accuracy<br />
<br />
(for help in sustaining this daamge at range from foes)<br />
Energy, optional vitality.<br />
<br />
Casters shouldnt need to focus as much on health as they need to currently imo, it makes an unfair advantage for melee classes, as they have less stats that they NEED to focus on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imo, if AOEs where changed to have less of a &quot;damage&quot; impact and more of a &quot;anti-caster&quot; impact, it would even the field.<br />
<br />
I dont think a caster should need to worry about dieing from most damage-based aoes, i think they should have to worry about silencing aoes, energy draining aoes, spell haste reducing aoes, and other things that are less fatal but equally detremental to a melee class having to withstand close range aoes that are tailored to hinder their game play (such as +end cost curses)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I also think that ALL abilities should be based off of a % of the attack value, with no statics.<br />
<br />
That way spells like Seradons are always going to be = to &quot;so and so&quot; casts of Taqmir's.<br />
<br />
They could include seperate &quot;spell attack&quot; in different elements, similar to how spell focus currently works, that way if a staff has say a huge fire spell damage boost, but a poor arcane or cold boost, then we could tailor our offense for the particular fight we are in.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it would be much, much easier to balance spells and attack abilities if they are all based on the same attack value, as you can definatly make clear distinctions such as &quot;while Taqmir's is 250% spell damage, and costs 250 energy, Char might be 400% spell damage, with a slight reuse, and cost 500 energy&quot; or something of the sort, which makes it easier to figure out that char is going to hit harder, but be less efficient, while Taqmir will hit for less, but is much more efficient.<br />
<br />
On tool tips, they could include the math as well as the actual number:<br />
<br />
&quot;You stike your foe with a spear of flame, dealing 400% (5000) damage at max range, and 20% less damage with each meter away from max range&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
What would all this accomplish, besides making several devs but theri butts to convert over to this type of system?<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells would scale while still being in relation to each other as you level, and they would always keep pace with melee classes, and casters would have a REASON to really want that next staff, wand, or pair of foci, as it would make a rather strong impact on how hard they nuke.<br />
<br />
<br />
It would remove spell damage focus from gear, which means casters would have less stats to have to spread between on their gear, balancing them up with the melee classes who dont have to worry about &quot;melee damage focus&quot; currently since thats ALL based on their weapon(s).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Energy costs on spells would be scaled from where they are currently, so that it would be a steady progression, w/o any &quot;ranks.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How do you do this? its really simple:<br />
<br />
Lets look at the actual costs on Taqmir's 4 vs 3:<br />
<br />
level 48<br />
298 Energy, returns 30-60 energy over 6 seconds<br />
<br />
vs<br />
<br />
level 42<br />
269 Energy, returns 25-50 energy over 6 seconds<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The difference in energy is 29, and 5 - 10 on the over time feedback.<br />
<br />
So, if this spell is going to gradually approach the value by the time it eaches 48, you would divid the difference by the number of levels it takes to each this point, and you have your costs scaled so that you never have &quot;jumps&quot; like from level 47 to 48.<br />
<br />
<br />
The energy cost would be 4.833 per level, or for simplicity just round up to 5 more energy cost per level, but keep in mind that better gear and higher natural intellegence are going to be improving with each level, so chances are your efficiency is still improving.<br />
<br />
So, by level 46, you are 4 levels above 42, so 4.83 x 4 = 19.3, so +19 on the energy cost brings you to 288 energy cost, and by 48, it will be 298, the whole while the damage has scaled with your character's advancement though, vs being a static &quot;amount&quot; of damage from 42 to 47, then getting a big &quot;boost&quot; at 48 when the base damage catches up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, each rank of a spell, unless it actually adds something &quot;new&quot; over the old version, merely &quot;catches up&quot; your spell's base damage, which is why it appears to be an increase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Technically you can completely remove all cases of Rank abilities in this game by looking at the current differences in their &quot;ranks&quot; and dividing it amoung the levels between ranks, creating a smooth progression that has no scaling issues.<br />
<br />
Abilities that do get sudden jumps in effectiveness, like snare durations or %'s, could also gradually increase, rather than having a &quot;semi useless&quot; snare like rangers have at the lower levels that suddenly jumps high enough to be more useful for kiting, their snare could gradually get better and better as they appreach the level where they currently get the rank ii or iii versions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Abilities that are based on a Static pool such as Phenomina points, Virtue points, or Endurance should never, ever need ranks, because if they are % based off a pool, they they will always be powerful compared to the other abilities that share that pool.<br />
<br />
If, for example, the absolute, only change in Starfall, a druid's phenomina, is that &quot;higher ranks do more damage,&quot; then there is no need for higher ranks, make it just an ability called &quot;starfall&quot; that improves as you level.<br />
<br />
If they want it to do 10k damage at 50, but only 3k at level 20, then scale it throughout so that its constantly improving with your character and never reaching a point where its &quot;pointless&quot; to cast it because your other nukes just got &quot;ranked up&quot; and rival it in power.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You smoothe out the  &quot;jumps&quot; in effectivness when you scale abilities, and retain spell's power when compared to each other, as well as ensure that they will ALWAYS be strong, as they are all based off the same base attack stat for damage, rather than having different bases on different spells that are all being modified by a % based on intel/sdf/sdr and such.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>WARNING: The following is long winded and technical, the gist of the point is with Ranked abilities, lacking the constant increase of abilities that scale naturally with each level between these ranks, along with the issue of spells ranking up at different level intervals (6 for Taq, 8 for Char) you get extreme imbalances as you level up, where spells suddenly become &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; in relation to other spells. Any time you &quot;rank up&quot; Char, its useful, but as soon as you get the next Taqmir's, Char loses a lot of its value has a dps tool.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
The following values are provider via Curse, which probably has no been updated to reflect the damage enhancement to the Taqmires spell line which only exasperates the issue im about to outline, but using what information I have, here are my findings:<br />
<br />
<br />
If Taqmir's is ment to be efficient, while Char is an inefficient damage &quot;boost&quot;, that should (and with scaling would) be retained form level 8 to level 50.<br />
<br />
Never will char &quot;lag behind&quot; taqmir, so that its &quot;worthless&quot; to use it compared to your newest rank of Taqmir until you get your &quot;new&quot; Char, Char will always be the higher dps option, with a bigger tax on your energy, while Taqmir would be the more efficient, but less burst damage option.<br />
<br />
Currently there are levels as you level up where using char is a detremental in most cases, as its energy cost and damage it produces is less effective than using a reciently aquired higher rank Taqmir.<br />
<br />
At level 6, Taqmirs does less damage than char, 168 damage but only costs 57 energy and returns 5-10, while char does a total of 238 damage but costs 83 energy. They are balance, with different uses.<br />
<br />
Right at the start, the player learns that if energy conservation is an issue, use Taqmir and ignore char, and if speedy dps is desired, use char then a taqmir.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But go forward just a few levels and you fight that at level 12, Taqmir's <u>new </u>rank is now 288 damage, and costs 94 energy and returns 5 - 15 energy, but now it has a 2.5 casting time, yet still out out dpses char by a long shot merely cast back to back, and is more efficient still.<br />
<br />
You are still stuck with Char 1 for now, which deals less damage for almost the exact same cost, and will not deliver this damage as quickly as the new Taqmirs.<br />
<br />
By 14, you get the next char, which is 447 damage for 137 energy, which is now more effective than taqmirs once more for fast damage, but is much less efficient.<br />
<br />
But then again at 18, you get yet again the new taqmir, which is now hitting for 417 for 127 energy, returning 10-20 energy, which again dwards the damage added by Char with a lower energy cost, energy feedback, and other factors that make using char just not worth it until it gets ranked up again at level 22.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
See the cycle of Char becoming worthless because it is not scaling as quickly as Taqmir's with ranks, then suddenly becoming &quot;uber&quot; for a few levels, until the next Taqmir is aquired? The only time this is not the case is level 6 and 30, when they both simultainously rank up.<br />
<br />
<br />
If these were constant, at 18 when we would get the &quot;new taq&quot; for 417 damage at 127 energy (before feedback of 10-20), the damage on a scaling Char should be 560 at 165 energy, as it has been 4 levels past level 14. One cast of char scaled is worth 125% damage of Taq, but costs +23% more.<br />
<br />
If i had the time i would show a spreadsheet of how the base damages of spells could scale, and you would quickly see that they correlate to each other well enough for a % based system to be established.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><font color="Red"><font size="5">IMPORTANT</font></font></b><br />
<br />
I can give no better example than to show the level 30 versions, where the line up compared to eachother, to what they should be at level 46, when you recieve the final version of char.<br />
<br />
If you compare the level 30 versions, the only level where they actually match up besides level 6, you find that a single cast of char costs +22% more than a single cast of Taq's Barrage at 30, at +124% damage per cast, now look how that compares to my earlier example of how the &quot;scaled&quot; cost on Char would have made it +125% damage of taq in a single cast, with a cost that is +23% more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that you have seen the values of how a &quot;scaled&quot; char matches up with the actual level 18 Taqmir 4, compare the highest ranks for how much a 2 level difference in scaling acounts for:<br />
<br />
At 46/48, a single cast costs 17% more energy than Taqmir before the feedback is calculated, and only deals 19% more damage per cast.<br />
<br />
If we look at a scaled version of Taqmir to see what it &quot;should&quot; be at 46 for and equal comparison, it ends up as 287 energy, which when compared to the actual level 46 char, it ends up as ~21% more energy per cast with Char at 23% more damage per cast, much closer to my intended scaled values.<br />
<br />
Also, these spells would be scaled up to level 50, so they would be closer to the damage of your current level 50 spells and would correlate better with them.<br />
<br />
Char V deals 1183 damage at 304 cost, Char VI deals 1462 damage at 361 cost.<br />
<br />
So in 8 levels the damage as increased by 19%, and the cost has increased by 16%, so using those values to estimate what Char VII would be at level 54, we could assume it is 1740 damage at 420 energy.<br />
<br />
<b>Char at level 50, if we follow the paturns of what the previous ranks established, it should cost 391 Energy and deal 1601 damage if Char scaled properly each level from 46 to 50.</b><br />
<br />
Using the same method to see what Taqmir should be at 50 when scaled:<br />
<br />
Taqmir's at 42 deals 1036 damage at 269 cost, and at 48 it deals 1178 damage at 298 cost, so it increases its damage by 12% and cost by 10% in 6 levels, so at 54 it would estimated to be 1319 damage at 328 cost.<br />
<br />
Using those values, since taqmir's gains 141 damage and 30 energy cost over that 6 level span, it gains 23.5 damage and 5 energy cost per level.<br />
<br />
<b>The level 50 scaled Taqmir's Barrage would be damage 1225 damage at a 308 cost.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
So, when comparing spell damage, if we actually scaled our spells properly, they would be much closer to the level 50 spells in terms of potientially being used.<br />
<br />
Certainly some spells simply are too weak at the base level when compared to our other spells, but scaling is certainly a large part of the problem.<br />
<br />
Since these are the base values, the shear differince in damage is only expanded when you add intelligence, +%damage abilities, spell damage focus, spell damage rating, and other modifiers.<br />
<br />
The slight damage boost at the base level doesnt seem like it would make a huge impact, but once you star getting into the modifiers, it makes a DYNAMIC impact on final damage numbers.

The biggest difference between casters &amp; melees is not skills.<br />
As you said 6 Interests vs 6 Interests.<br />
<br />
But Basic Itemisation (we buy hp mana dps, they buy only hp/dps) which<br />
means that unless itemisation is well &quot;done&quot; we get screwed.<br />
<br />
And since the itemisation guy is a world class fucktard :<br />

Itemisation is horrendous, i'm LOSING dps when looting Cylus armor !<br />
<br />
Also Endurance vs ManaRegen is very very biased against casters.<br />
<br />
The worse is &quot;Buffs&quot;  many classes have buffs that add to melee dmg &amp; melee critic.<br />
NO class has buffs that increases spell dmg.<br />
<br />
And i wont even talk about debuffs (all we get is shaman debuff).<br />
Want to talk about melee debuffs ? who doesnt decrease ac/miti/con ?
