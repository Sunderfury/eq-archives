			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I've been noticing how many situations I've been put in in the last four years where students around me are easily connected and being productive in boring ass lectures and group activities and I, being Hella Poverty, am left out of the loop on assignments and information because I am not really high tech (pen and paper). <br />
<br />
I also notice I usually have a lot of ideas or corrections to code or other ideas I can make during school but these things get lost during the day, and making written notes of them is laborious and those also get swept way or ignored.<br />
<br />
At first I chocked all this up to me wanting a toy and simply not having the luxury of young-people toys, so I just ignored it and stuck to my Old Man Technology. <br />
<br />
Increasingly, though, I feel like I am seriously missing out on this and my productivity is being hurt, and it's time I got a tablet to take advantage of all the free wifi without lugging around a laptop or paying for expensive smartphone data plans. Powerful enough to get things done but not so much that it becomes a toy.  <br />
<br />
I would definitely use it, and it'd be a useful companion to my commuter life. Definitely more useful than my phone.<br />
<br />
So - I'm looking for something like a<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834230930" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Google Nexus</a> - I need it to be able to word process (with a real keyboard, I would also need one of those) and connect to networks, being able to compile java or C would be great, too, and would keep me ahead of my own game and schedule.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to look up the current stuff myself but if anyone has ideas of what I should look out for, avoid, or consider if I decide to get one, please post up. <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div>

<br />
<br />
John Brennan and John Kiriakou worked together years ago, but their careers have dramatically diverged. Brennan is now on track to head the CIA, while Kiriakou is headed off to prison. Each of their fates is tied to the so-called &quot;war on terror&quot;, which under President George W Bush provoked worldwide condemnation. <br />
<br />
President Barack Obama rebranded the &quot;war on terror&quot; innocuously as &quot;overseas contingency operations&quot;, but, rather than retrench from the odious practices of his predecessor, Obama instead escalated. His promotion of Brennan, and his prosecution of Kiriakou, demonstrate how the recent excesses of US presidential power are not transient aberrations, but the creation of a frightening new normal, where drone strikes, warrantless surveillance, assassination, and indefinite detention are conducted with arrogance and impunity, shielded by secrecy and beyond the reach of law.<br />
<br />
John Kiriakou spent 14 years at the CIA as an analyst and a case officer. In 2002, he led the team that found Abu Zubaydah, alleged to be a high-ranking member of al-Qaida. Kiriakou was the first to publicly confirm the use of waterboarding by the CIA, in a 2007 interview with ABC's Brian Ross. He told Ross: <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;At the time, I felt that waterboarding was something that we needed to do … I think I've changed my mind, and I think that waterboarding is probably something that we shouldn't be in the business of doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kiriakou says he found the &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; immoral, and declined to be trained to use them.<br />
<br />
Since the interview, it has become known that Zubaydah was waterboarded at least 83 times, and that he provided no useful information as a result. He remains imprisoned at Guantánamo Bay, without charge. Kiriakou will soon start serving his 30-month prison sentence, but not for disclosing anything about waterboarding. He pled guilty to disclosing the name of a former CIA interrogator to a journalist, with information that the interrogator himself had posted to a publicly available website.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, John Brennan, longtime counterterrorism advisor to Obama, is expected to receive Senate confirmation as the new director of central intelligence. I recently asked Kiriakou what he thought of Brennan:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I've known John Brennan since 1990. I worked directly for John Brennan twice. I think that he is a terrible choice to lead the CIA. I think that it's time for the CIA to move beyond the ugliness of the post-September 11 regime, and we need someone who is going to respect the constitution and to not be bogged down by a legacy of torture.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think that President Obama's appointment of John Brennan sends the wrong message to all Americans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Obama has once already considered Brennan for the top CIA job, back in 2008. Brennan withdrew his nomination then under a hail of criticism for supporting the Bush-era torture policies in his various top-level intelligence positions, including head of the National Counterterrorism Center.<br />
<br />
What a difference four years makes. With the killing of Osama bin Laden notched in his belt, Obama seems immune from counterterror criticism. John Brennan is said to manage the notorious &quot;kill list&quot; of people that Obama believes he has the right to kill anytime, anywhere on the planet, as part of his &quot;overseas contingency operations&quot;. This includes the killing of US citizens, without any charge, trial, or due process whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Drone strikes are one way these assassinations are carried out. US citizen Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in Yemen by a drone strike; then, two weeks later, his 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, was killed the same way.<br />
<br />
I asked Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who served as chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell from 2002 to 2005, what he thought of Brennan. He told me:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening with drone strikes around the world right now is, in my opinion, as bad a development as many of the things we now condemn so readily, with 20/20 hindsight, in the George W Bush administration. We are creating more enemies than we're killing. We are doing things that violate international law.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are even killing American citizens without due process and have an attorney general who has said that due process does not necessarily include the legal process. Those are really scary words.&quot;<br />
<br />
While Kiriakou goes to prison for revealing a name, the UK-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism is launching a project called &quot;Naming the Dead&quot;, hoping &quot;to identify as many as possible of those killed in US covert drone strikes in Pakistan, whether civilian or militant.&quot; The BIJ reports a &quot;minimum 2,629 people who appear to have so far died in CIA drone strikes in Pakistan&quot;.<br />
<br />
John Brennan should be asked about each of them.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Haven't seen any threads on this yet, but I'm really enjoying this game.  It is free to play, and free to download, courtesy of a couple of guys from New Zealand.  There are microtransactions, which they seem to be using to support everything.<br />
<br />
I'm really enjoying it; its still open beta although supposedly there will be no more character resets or wipes.  6 classes, based off 3 stats (int, dex, str).  Very similar to Diablo 2, including waypoints, scrolls for portals and ID, divided into Acts,  and levels of difficulty (normal, cruel, merciless).  There are also events and leagues (sort of like hardcore mode).  Skill tree is massive, and each class starts somewhere different on it.  It is multiplayer much like D3; you will only see other players in hub areas, but your party will go to whatever instanced zone you go to.<br />
<br />
So, if you enjoyed Diablo 2, this is seriously worth the time for being entirely free.  Check it out.  And if someone posted about it and I didn't see, I apologize.<br />

Coulport, near Glasgow (ah huh) is where the Uk stores it's nuclear warheads, we've got at last 160 of them for Trident and unknown number of older ones <br />
as said before UK is one the most stupid secretive states in the world in reality, after North Korea and couple of others, hence big fight against FOI and now them trying to claw back FOI laws etc. The &quot;Official Secrets Act&quot; &quot; has been misused and abused for about a century in ways Nero couldn't have dreamed of, sigh.<br />
<br />
anyway, so a private consortium, running a weapon store...and we privatized Aldermaston which makes our nukes (and it had a serious accident last year)<br />
Wonderful, frikkin' wonderful....<br />

			Clyde nuclear contract awarded The decision to privatise maintenance of Britain's nuclear weapons on the Clyde was made last year <br />
Private contractors are to take over the maintenance of Britain's nuclear weapons on the Clyde.<br />
<br />
The Ministry of Defence has signed a contract which will see 149 workers transfer to an alliance of companies, looking after Trident and Polaris weapons systems.<br />
<br />
There are also to be 39 Royal Navy secondments.<br />
<br />
They work at the Royal Navy Armament Depot at Coulport and the Strategic Weapon Support Building at Faslane.<br />
<br />
Both facilities are part of HM Naval Base Clyde.<br />
<br />
The consortium, known as ABL Alliance, is made up of companies that already work on defence contracts, led by AWE, along with Babcock and Lockheed Martin.<br />
<br />
The decision to privatise the work was reached in May last year, when the MoD &quot;decided the most effective way to sustain the workforce in the future was to use an experienced supplier within the private sector&quot;.<br />
<br />
'Safety record'<br />
 <br />
The deal is a 15-year contract to outsource weapons support at Coulport and Faslane.<br />
<br />
The jobs are in industrial and technical grades, warehousing and logistical support, along with supervisors and managers.<br />
<br />
The MoD says it will continue to own the bases, and oversee security and activities at Coulport and Faslane, which will continue to be subject to the same safety regulation.<br />
<br />
A spokesman said: &quot;HM Naval Base Clyde has an excellent safety record and we are determined to maintain the highest standards of safety. <br />
<br />
&quot;The MoD will continue to own the Naval Base sites, including Coulport, and Naval Base Commander Clyde will retain overall responsibility for security and for the activities carried out at Coulport and the SWSB. <br />
<br />
&quot;The site will also continue to be a MoD Nuclear Authorised site, so will be subject to regulation by the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator, the Office of Nuclear Regulation and other regulatory bodies.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The last few years have been... interesting. They say that once you've hit rock bottom, there's only one way to go, and it seems my stars are aligned for another season. Tomorrow, I embark on a new journey, I'm not really sure if I'm ready for it, but I'm confident I can handle any curve balls thrown my way. I'm moving to New Jersey for a new job. I consider myself lucky that I can uproot myself like this, but I still feel a twinge of sorrow for the people I am leaving behind for a while. I don't know if I'll be back, but I feel like Seattle is and always will be my home, so perhaps some day my path will lead me back.<br />
<br />
To Mom, see you on Broadway in a few months<br />
To Matt and Krysten, you are the most hospitable people in the world, your generosity is renowned, and I will miss you all dearly<br />
To my friends, remember all the good times we've had together and I'll see you again<br />
To my coworkers, so long and thanks for all the fish<br />
<br />
To my new family, watch out!<br />
To my new friends, I will try to be more sociable<br />
To my new coworkers, I can't wait to see what's in store!<br />
<br />
This letter is not really going to be shared with anyone, but I felt like I needed to write it. It's been a busy week getting everything arranged, and there's still a ton of planning to do, but I needed to take a few minutes to reminisce on the last few years and take stock of where I've been and where I'm going. I've mended fences to a reasonable level with my ex, I've earned respect in the eyes of my coworkers and managers, and I've decided to move across the continent for a time. It just felt like I needed to say something about it. It's almost momentous.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.</div>

<b><font size="4">Obama Was Right About the Jedi Meld</font></b><br />
<br />
Submitted by Petey on March 1, 2013 - 3:53pm <br />
<br />
Today, during a heated discussion on the sequester, a frustrated President Barack Obama made the following statement to the press corps as they challenged him to show more leadership in negotiations:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm presenting a fair deal, the fact that they don’t take it means that I should somehow, you know, do a Jedi mind meld with these folks and convince them to do what’s right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Various commentators immediately criticized the President for, as they say, crossing the streams. Jim Kuhnhenn of the Associated Press wrote that Obama &quot;…mixed his sci-fi metaphors…The Jedi reference comes from Star Wars, and the mind meld from Star Trek.&quot; Xeni Jardin of BoingBoing wrote that the President &quot;tried to drop a gratuitous nerd culture reference…and blew it.&quot; #ObamaSciFiQuotes began trending on Twitter, mocking Obama for his apparent misstep.<br />
<br />
Out of a nascent sense of patriotism, and animated by the spirit of my friend Matt Stempeck's LazyTruth, I now reluctantly but firmly step forward in defense of my President against these reckless and ill-founded accusations. Obama did not, as Jardin claimed, &quot;blow&quot; his reference: he was more correct than any of his critics could possibly imagine.<br />
<br />
First, as a friend pointed out, there is a Jedi Meld well established within the admittedly capacious but nonetheless official contours of the Star Wars: Expanded Universe. In Outbound Flight, a novel written by the prolific Timothy Zahn, the Jedi Master Jorus C'baoth instructs a young Anakin Skywalker that the Jedi Meld &quot;permits a group of Jedi to connect their minds so closely as to act as a single person.&quot; (emphasis added)<br />
<br />
According to Wookieepedia, the Jedi Meld was deployed by dozens of Jedi, including (but not limited to) Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade Skywalker, and Anakin, Jacen, and Jaina Solo, across dozens officially-licensed books. Indeed, its recovery and redevelopment, principally by the Solo children, was an important turning point in the Yuuzhan Vong War as chronicled exhaustively in the New Jedi Order series.<br />
<br />
But not only is the Jedi Meld, through general acceptance and uncontroversial use, authoritatively established within the official Star Wars universe: it was the right reference for Obama to make.<br />
<br />
Jedi Mind Tricks, according to Wookieepedia, &quot;refer to a spectrum of Force powers which influenced the thoughts of sentient creatures&quot;; the Vulcan Mind-meld, according to Wikipedia, &quot;is a technique for sharing thoughts, experiences, memories, and knowledge with another individual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both are powerful methods of influence, to be sure, but neither fully captures what Obama was suggesting when he said he could not &quot;do a Jedi mind meld with these folks and convince them to do what’s right.&quot; (emphasis added) Rather, the most appropriate method for Obama would be a Jedi Meld. For it is the Jedi Meld, rather than its more familiar cousins, which would allow Obama to be as effective as he suggested he would like to be, and arguably the only one which allows him to be effective in the particular way he describes.<br />
<br />
This argument is best understood through the framework of actor-network theory as developed by Bruno Latour. ANT is a huge box to unpack in a blog post, so for now let me simply say this: for Latour - and apparently Obama - the world is composed of actors. Progress towards a particular goal is made by convincing (&quot;enrolling&quot;) other actors to be &quot;allies&quot; which, once linked to and by you, bend their collective will towards your goal. As Clay Spinuzzi writes, &quot;An actor-network is composed of many entities or actants that enter into an alliance to satisfy their diverse aims. Each actant enrolls the others, that is, finds ways to convince the others to support its own aims.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some have commented that these passages suggest that the Jedi Meld is used for communication, not convincing. But through the lens of Latour we see that the convincing comes before and during the communication. A Jedi Meld cannot take place before/until other Jedi have been convinced to enter into it, and thereafter it serves as a continuing site of contestation and cooptation. As I wrote in the comments below, it is C'baoth's description of the Jedi Meld - &quot;allows them to act as if they were a single person&quot; - which implies, indeed necessitates influence: an assembled actor-network only holds together if all have been convinced to act as one. The linkages are made through not only the mind-meld but the other ontological actors which keep the linkages active from moment to moment.<br />
<br />
When Obama writes that he &quot;can't do a Jedi mind meld with these folks and convince them to do what’s right,&quot; then, what we should understand him to be saying is that he cannot simply enroll these actively hostile allies at a distance and convince them to move towards his goal any more easily than a scientist can straightforwardly enroll gravity to make him fly. Like hot coals beneath the feet of a shyster soothsayer, the Republicans are, viz Obama, obstinate, slippery black boxes which remain unopenable and unenrollable. The Jedi Meld method fails, and with it the network of possibility, not only for lack of midi-chlorians, but for a lack of available allies. <br />
<br />
Far from being a mistake, mixed metaphor, or slip-of-the-tongue, Obama's extemporaneous invocation of &quot;Jedi Meld&quot; was precisely on point, simultaneously displaying his nuanced and considerable command of the finer details of both actor-network theory and the Star Wars: Expanded Universe. Instead of mocking him from the comfort of our replica X-wing armchairs, as nerds and citizens we should be honored and awed by a commander-in-chief who offhandedly deploys such concepts in the public discourse.<br />

			Dog 'saved life' of missing Polish girl Firefighters said the animal stayed with the child throughout the night <br />
Firefighters in Poland say a small dog likely saved the life of a three-year-old girl who went missing from her home overnight in freezing temperatures.<br />
<br />
The child, Julia, vanished on Friday and was found lying in marshes several kilometres from her house on Saturday morning, with the dog by her side.<br />
<br />
She is now in hospital in western Poland, suffering from frostbite after temperatures fell to -5C (23F).<br />
<br />
Firefighter Grzegorz Szymanski said the dog kept the child warm enough to live.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the whole night the animal was with the girl, it never left her. Remember, it was 5 degrees below zero and the child was wet,&quot; he said, adding that the animal was the most important factor in the girl's survival.<br />
<br />
 Julia was found lying in marshland <br />
More than 200 people had searched for the child overnight. It is thought she spent hours wandering through the forest near her home in the village of Pierzwin.<br />
<br />
Her parents had last seen the three-year-old playing in the backyard with the small black mongrel.<br />
<br />
She was eventually discovered by firefighters after she was heard crying for her mother.

			Eighteen-year-old Taylor Wilson has designed a compact nuclear reactor that could one day burn waste from old atomic weapons to power anything from homes and factories to space colonies.<br />
<br />
The American teen, who gained fame four years ago after designing a fusion reactor he planned to build in the garage of his family&#8217;s home, shared his latest endeavor at a TED Conference in southern California on Thursday.<br />
<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s about bringing something old, fission, into the 21st Century,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;I think this has huge potential to change the world.&#8221;<br />
<br />
He has designed a small reactor capable of generating 50-100 megawatts of electricity, enough to power as many as 100,000 homes.<br />
<br />
The reactor can be made assembly-line style and powered by molten radioactive material from nuclear weapons, Wilson said. The relatively small, modular reactor can be shipped sealed with enough fuel to last for 30 years.<br />
<br />
&#8220;You can plop them down anywhere in the world and they work, buried under the ground for security reasons,&#8221; he said, while detailing his design at TED.<br />
<br />
&#8220;In the Cold War we built up this huge arsenal of nuclear weapons and we don&#8217;t need them anymore,&#8221; Wilson said. &#8220;It would be great if we could eat them up, and this reactor loves this stuff.&#8221;<br />
<br />
His reactors are designed to spin turbines using gas instead of steam, meaning they operate at temperatures lower than those of typical nuclear reactors and don&#8217;t spew anything if there is a breach.<br />
<br />
The fuel is in the form of molten salt, and the reactors don&#8217;t need to be pressurized, according to the teenager.<br />
<br />
&#8220;In the event of an accident, you can just drain the core into a tank under the reactor with neutron absorbers and the reaction stops,&#8221; Wilson said.<br />
<br />
&#8220;There is no inclination for the fission products to leave this reactor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In an accident, the reactor may be toast, which is sorry for the power company, but there is no problem.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Wilson, who graduated grade school in May, said he is putting off university to focus on a company he created to make Modular Fission Reactors.<br />
<br />
He sees his competition as nations, particularly China, and the roadblocks ahead as political instead of technical.<br />
<br />
Wilson planned to have a prototype ready in two years and a product to market in five years.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Not only does it combat climate change, it can bring power to the developing world,&#8221; Wilson said with teenage optimism.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket designed by those planning to habitat other planets. Not only would you have power for propulsion, but power once you get there.&#8221;

			Scrap 'dangerous and unnecessary' secret justice bill, hundreds of lawyers and QCs urge the Government<br />
 Law professionals demand Government drop plans for new court system<br />
 Hearings behind closed doors 'erodes civil justice system core principles'<br />
<br />
 Letter signed by 702 include 38 QCs, notably Ian Macdonald<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
By James Chapman<br />
 <br />
PUBLISHED:22:36, 27 February 2013| UPDATED:22:42, 27 February 2013<br />
<br />
Demand: Ian Macdonald QC, pictured in 2004, is one of the 702 law professionals who have signed the letter<br />
 <br />
Hundreds of lawyers, including some of the country&#8217;s most eminent QCs, today launch a devastating attack on Government plans for secret courts as &#8216;contrary to the rule of law&#8217; and demand they are dropped.<br />
 <br />
More than 700 figures from the legal profession insist that the Government&#8217;s Justice and Security Bill is &#8216;dangerous and unnecessary&#8217; and will &#8216;fatally undermine&#8217; the fairness of court hearings.<br />
 <br />
The group of 702, which includes 38 QCs, says in a letter published in today&#8217;s Daily Mail that the proposals to allow a huge extension of court hearings behind closed doors will &#8216;erode core principles of our civil justice system&#8217; by undermining the right to a fair trial and open justice.<br />
 <br />
They include Nicholas Vineall QC, former chairman of the Conservative Lawyers&#8217; Association, Reverend Nicholas Mercer, a lieutenant colonel who was the Army&#8217;s most senior lawyer during the Iraq war, and Ian Macdonald QC, who resigned as a security-cleared special advocate in protest at the existing use of secret justice.<br />
 <br />
The intervention of such a significant number of lawyers is a shattering blow for the Government, which had been hoping to get the legislation through Parliament as quietly as possible following months of controversy. It is expected to return to the Commons next week.<br />
 <br />
In another setback for the Government, a group of international organisations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and similar bodies from Ireland, Canada, South Africa, Argentina, Egypt and Hungary, also expressed concerns about the Bill in a joint statement.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
<br />
More...<br />
 No to secret justice: The letter from 700 legal professionals<br />
 Smoking ban in public places to be extended to cars carrying children under plan being considered by David Cameron <br />
Hospital chief executive steps down after investigation is launched into patient deaths<br />
 <br />
<br />
It warned: &#8216;If the UK Parliament passes this proposal into law it will be a huge setback for those of us fighting to secure truth and fairness from our own governments and within our own justice systems across the world.&#8217;<br />
 <br />
The Daily Mail has led criticism of Government plans to allow so-called &#8216;closed material procedures&#8217; (CMPs), in which cases are conducted entirely in private, in civil hearings.<br />
 <br />
Defendants or claimants will not allowed to be present, know or challenge the case against them and must be represented by a security-cleared special advocate, rather than their own lawyer.<br />
 <br />
Currently, such procedures are used in tiny numbers of immigration and deportation hearings, but the Government wants to extend them across the civil courts in cases deemed to involve national security.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Secret court: Those who have signed the letter say court hearings behind closed doors 'erodes civil justice system core principles'<br />
 <br />
The legislation has been drafted in close cooperation with the security services, who have claimed other countries may stop sharing intelligence with Britain if it risks being disclosed in open court.<br />
 <br />
But critics say the proposals are simply designed to ensure potentially embarrassing cases are conducted behind closed doors.<br />
 <br />
Reverend Nicholas Mercer, one of the most prominent signatories of today&#8217;s letter, said: &#8216;The Justice and Security Bill has one principle aim and that is to cover up UK complicity in rendition and torture.<br />
 <br />
&#8216;The Bill is an affront to the open justice on which this country rightly prides itself and, above all, it is an affront to human dignity. The fact that some of those individuals who are complicit in rendition and torture can not only assist in the drafting of the Bill but also vote to cover their tracks is a constitutional scandal.<br />
 <br />
&#8216;It is little wonder that the Bill has been heavily criticised by the UN Rapporteur on Torture and condemned by the vast majority of lawyers and human rights organisations in this country.&#8217;<br />
 <br />
Michael Fordham QC, one of the country's leading public law specialists, warned the Government that if it pressed ahead judges might refuse to preside over secret courts.<br />
 <br />
&#8216;Secret trials undermine the principles of open justice and natural justice on which the rule of law is built. By promoting the spread of secrecy, state authorities become self-immunised from proper public scrutiny, and in relation to the very types of actions which most need it,&#8217; he said.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
&#8216;Parliament is unwisely provoking the untapped power of our unwritten constitution which it could come to regret. The last word will not be Parliament's, but that of judges asked to preside over secret courts. An unwise Parliament may be about to find that it has constitutional limits, when the rule of law fights back.&#8217;<br />
 <br />
Paul Bowen QC said: &#8216;The extension of closed material procedures is not necessary for public protection.  The state is already free to withhold evidence from disclosure under Public Interest Immunity procedures.  What is not fair, or just, is evidence being shown in secret to the judge who decides the case on the basis of that evidence.<br />
 <br />
&#8216;In those cases where disclosure of torture or other human rights abuses by the British government or its agents is sought, the public interest surely requires that to be brought into the open.&#8217;<br />
 <br />
Dinah Rose QC, a former special advocate and another signatory, said: &#8216;Closed material procedures are alien to British justice and will distort civil trials beyond recognition. <br />
<br />
<br />
'What may look and sound like a trial is in fact nothing of the sort. Judges will be asked to decide cases on the basis of &quot;secret evidence&quot; that would not withstand legal challenge and hand down judgments in secret. This Bill is a dangerous perversion of our national legal system and will undermine constitutional rights.&#8217;<br />
 <br />
Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights group Liberty, said: &#8216;When will the coalition that once championed civil liberties listen to the condemnation of its secret courts proposals?<br />
 <br />
&#8216;Liberty was dismissed as the reactionary human rights lobby- but now legal and international communities have joined the opposition to secret stitch-ups between government and judges, with victims, press and public shut outside. Secret justice is a complete perversion - it is no justice at all.&#8217;<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Minister without portfolio Kenneth Clarke, who is in charge of the legislation, will today table further amendments supposed to address some of the concerns of critics.<br />
 <br />
They mean a judge must be satisfied that the Government has considered whether to make a claim for public interest immunity before making an application for a secret hearing as one of the tests to be met. Mr Clarke is also proposing an annual report on the operation of closed hearings and a full review after five years.<br />
 <br />
He said: &#8216;With these final amendments the Government has gone to extreme lengths to meet every practical legal objection that has been made about the Bill. The judge now has total discretion over whether to order a closed material procedure following an application either by the Government, the claimant, or from the court of its own motion.<br />
 <br />
&#8216;I do not believe closed material procedures are ideal, but in the very exceptional circumstances where national security is at stake, they offer the only practical means of delivering justice where otherwise there would be none. <br />
<br />
&#8216;CMPs already exist in our justice system and the Government does lose in them &#8211; sometimes to the great anger of the Daily Mail&#8217;s readers. <br />
<br />
&#8216;This Bill is now proportionate, sensible and necessary.  It resolves the highly unsatisfactory legal no-man&#8217;s land we have at the moment where national security cases can be brought, but not resolved.  <br />
<br />
&#8216;Of course these amendments will not reassure the Bill&#8217;s hardline critics, who prefer silence to judicial decisions on allegations of kidnap and torture, and are prepared to accept that millions of pounds could go without challenge to individuals who could be terrorists.<br />
