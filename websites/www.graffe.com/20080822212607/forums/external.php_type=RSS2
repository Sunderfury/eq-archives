				Warner Bros. has confirmed long-running rumors that it will reboot the Superman movie franchise. <br />
<br />
Jeff Robinov, Warner Bros. Pictures Group President, tells The Wall Street Journal that the Man of Steel will be reintroduced on the big screen without regard to 2006’s Superman Returns. <br />
<br />
“Superman didn’t quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to,” Robinov says. “It didn’t position the character the way he needed to be positioned. ... Had Superman worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009.” <br />
<br />
There’s no mention whether Superman Returns director Bryan Singer will be part of the reboot. Earlier this week, Variety’s Anne Thompson reported “that it is a priority at the studio to find the right direction and if Bryan Singer is willing to do that, fine, but if he gets in the way, he may not stay on the project.” <br />
<br />
Taking a page from Marvel, Warner Bros. has reversed its earlier position of using the now-stalled Justice League of America as a launching pad for other DC properties. Instead, it will focus on solo features to build toward a multicharacter film. <br />
<br />
“Along those lines, we have been developing every DC character that we own,” Robinov says. <br />
<br />
That may sound less like a “strategy” and more like a mad cash-grab. Something else that might not sit right with some fans is Robinov’s determination to explore the darker side of super-heroes: “We’re going to try to go dark to the extent that the characters allow it.” <br />
<br />
According to The Journal, Warner Bros. plans to release four comic-book movies in the next three years: the third Batman installment, the Superman reboot, and two focusing on other DC Comics characters. (It’s unclear whether Watchmen is included in that count.) Likely candidates include Green Arrow/Super Max, Green Lantern, Captain Marvel and, perhaps, Jonah Hex. <br />
<br />
As Variety reported over the weekend, Warner Bros. is expected to roll out its strategy for its DC Comics movie properties sometime within the next month.

				Seeing Invaders!, digital artist Douglas Edric Stanley's Space Invaders attacks New York's Twin Towers art installation, is very effective in eliciting an immediate emotional response. That makes it a successful work of art, even if reaction to such confrontational themes are rarely positive.<br />
<br />
Spending more time absorbing and, of course, playing Invaders! gives one a better perspective on what Stanley was aiming for. Invaders! is a two-player motion controlled spin on classic Space Invaders gameplay. Your best tactic, swinging your arms from side-to-side to fire a spread of bullets from your off screen cannon, is tiring. And futile.<br />
<br />
The towers will always fall, along with dozens of of its anonymous inhabitants.<br />
<br />
No matter how quickly you'll attack the air with movement, the alien invaders will always cause enough destruction to the World Trade Center towers to make them fall. In addition to raining down bullets, suicide UFOs will occasionally crash into the towers. You'll always fail, as clearing a screen full of invaders will simply be followed by a freshly restocked swarm.<br />
<br />
The Invaders! installation features a video loop that runs alongside the playable game. This video features scenes from the films Taxi Driver, Independence Day, Air Force One and Die Hard &#8212; all of which are American made films with a xenophobic streak &#8212; interspersed with stills of George W. Bush in his flight suit and John Wayne pointing a gun at the screen. Peppered in are brief clips of people playing Invaders! with a ticker listing &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;lo&quot; scores in red, white and blue text at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The artist's statement describes Invaders! as &quot;an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Invaders! may be unsettling, with its blending of archaic gameplay and modern day catastrophe, but it's also an impressive accomplishment in that it delivers complex messages via simple means. Despite its perceived insensitivity, Stanley's ability to use video games as a medium of artistic expression will likely be an important step in the form being taken seriously (by people who take things seriously).

<br />
Woman Arrested For Not Returning Books To Library<br />
<br />
Heidi Dalibor was arrested after she failed to return the books, &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; and &quot;White Oleander&quot;, last year.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I said, what could they possibly do? They can&#8217;t arrest me for this&#8230; I was wrong,&#8221; Dalibor said.<br />
<br />
Dalibor did not respond to four notices from the library, two phone calls and two letters. The library forwarded the case to police, who issued a citation for Dalibor's failure to return the materials or pay the fine. The citation included a court date, which Dalibor admits she ignored.<br />
<br />
With arrest warrant in hand, police showed up at Dalibor&#8217;s door and led her away in handcuffs.<br />
<br />
While the police have been criticized for going so far, the police chief said they simply followed the law.<br />
<br />
&#8220;None of this would have been necessary if she followed the agreement and returned the books,&#8221; said Grafton Police Chief Charles Wenten.<br />
<br />
Dalibor paid her $170 fine and was released.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I completely take responsibility for not paying my fine on time and not going to my court date,&#8221; Dalibor said.<br />
<br />
Still, she isn&#8217;t planning on returning the books.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I still have the books and I don&#8217;t plan to return them because they&#8217;re paid for now,&#8221; Dalibor said.</div>

Newsletter from John McCain Headquarters<br />
Re: Fundraising<br />
<br />
My friends, you have probably noticed that over the past few weeks, I have been criticized relentlessly by my opponent and his camp.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to speak with you directly, hopefully to set the record straight - as well as encourage you to contribute to my campaign in order to fight these scurrilous lies.<br />
<br />
If I seem to falter in clearly stating what I stand for today, stood for in the past, or will stand for tomorrow, that&#8217;s because I was a <b>POW</b>.<br />
<br />
I have been ridiculed because I don&#8217;t remember how many homes I own. But given the treatment I endured as a <b>POW</b>, is it not understandable that some memories will be faint and not easily called to mind?<br />
<br />
My friends, the important thing to remember in this race is not whether Czechoslovakia is still a country, but the challenges facing our nation &#8211; challenges that can best be met by someone who has served their country as a <b>POW</b>.<br />
<br />
I am certain that even the people in Iraq, the Heartland of the Arab World &#8211; Sunni, Shi&#8217;ia, whatever &#8211; agree that only a former <b>POW</b> would have the foreign policy credentials necessary to bring stability to the middle part of &#8211; wherever it is these people live.<br />
<br />
We all know that my opponent, Barack <u><b>HUSSEIN</b></u> O'Bama, is anxious to end this Noble Cause and slink away in utter defeat. And I ask you, as patriotic Americans: Where will the <b>POW</b>s <i>of the next generation come from, <u>if we abandon our efforts to create them now</u>? Who will run for the presidency on the <b><u>POW</u></b><u> platform in future</u></i>?<br />
<br />
There are now stories in the news, my friends, about my abandonment of my first wife and our children. My friends, allow me to remind you that I was a <b>POW</b>. How many nights did I spend dreaming of coming home to my beautiful bride, only to return and face the reality of a woman who just wasn&#8217;t what I&#8217;d been dreaming of while I was a<b> POW</b>?<br />
<br />
Had I not earned, by virtue of having been a <b>POW</b>, the right to live out the rest of my shattered life with a younger, prettier multi-millionairess?<br />
<br />
I have also been wrongfully taken to task because I may have plagiarized someone else&#8217;s <b>POW</b> story and recounted it as my own experience. We <b>POW</b>s will often do that, in a spirit of solidarity. So what&#8217;s the harm? Why is everyone tryin&#8217; to make something of it &#8211; I mean, Jesus, can&#8217;t you just let it go already?<br />
<br />
Now they&#8217;re on my wife&#8217;s back about this Mother Theresa story &#8211; so she can&#8217;t remember shit either, like how we wound up adopting a kid &#8211; BIG FUCKIN&#8217; DEAL!!! She&#8217;s the God-damned wife of a <b>POW</b>, and that affects her memory, too! Wanna make somethin&#8217; of it, my friends?<br />
<br />
It seems to me, my friends, that everyone is just pilin&#8217; on &#8211; &#8220;Oh, yeah, let&#8217;s ALL beat up on the <b>POW</b> guy, like he didn&#8217;t take enough abuse being a<b> POW</b>. Let&#8217;s get &#8216;im.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Even a hippie has-been like Jackson Browne and that Mike Myers freak are comin&#8217; after me now. No fuckin&#8217; respect for a <b>POW</b> &#8211; this is what the world has come to, thanks to those <b>commie Democrats</b> <i><b>who have been runnin&#8217; this country into the ground for the past eight years</b></i>!<br />
<br />
Well, THIS is one <b>POW</b> who isn&#8217;t going to take it anymore, my so-called friends.<br />
<br />
SO PUT UP AND SHUT UP!!!<br />
<br />
Send your money to my campaign RIGHT NOW, or <b><i><u>I will draft every one of your sorry asses, and send you to Iraq for the next hundred God-damned years!</u></i></b><br />
<br />
GOT IT?<br />
<br />
Your Friend,<br />
John McCain, <b>P.P.O.W</b>©<br />
<br />
<i>Proud Candidate for the Presidency of the United States of America<br />
AND Professional Prisoner of War (Patent Pending)</i>

Beginning the first day of the Democratic National Convention -- August 25, for those out of the loop -- the youth-centric political advocacy group will enable Xbox 360 owners to have their voices heard on an exclusive forum, participate in election-predicting polls, and, yes, register to vote through their 360. Rock the Vote's public service announcement videos will also be made available on the Xbox Live Marketplace.

</div>What impact could this have?  We had a thread about if the youth could help decide the vote and it seemed that no one thought it would.  Whats the thoughts now?  Twelve million users on XBox Live is a large crowd to reach out to.  If they give out an achievement for registering, I could see this having an effect.  <br />

Pretty cool.</div>

One of the roadblocks I started running into were recipes that are only available from the opposing side.<br />
<br />
I am on the alliance side and some of the recipes I am looking for are only for sale on the horde side. Is there a way to get these recipes? <br />
<br />
My original plan was to wait until I was high enough to survive a run to the vendor who sells the recipe, then I realized that the vendors will most likely never sell to me.<br />
<br />
Are the brokers connected? If not are there "black market" brokers?<br />
If that is not possible, can mail be sent to opposing sides? Maybe I can start up a horde character and mail the recipes back.<br />
<br />
Thank you to anyone who answers me.<br />

I'm looking for suggestions on how to implement this.  I've heard some say PHP/MySQL, others say PostgreSQL, etc.  Anyone have experience with something similar that could provide some advice?  Last time I did anything remotely like this was 10+ years ago and I'm sure there's new tools out there :)<br />
<br />
I'm looking for something that's secure, but easy to use/maintain from a development standpoint.</div>
