SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY!<br />
<br />
So, sitting out on a nice patio, enjoying an espresso, and this guy in a new GMC starts to back up in attempt to parallel park, and his car starts to belt out<br />
<br />
*ATTENTION PLEASE* THIS CAR IS BACKING UP<br />

<br />
Not once every few seconds, not just once or twice at the star to get attention, but no, it kept going and going, back to back, no delay inbetween, and rather loud also (as well, its meant to get attention of fucktards standing in the middle of parking spots unaware that a car is backing up).<br />
<br />
Now, to top it off, this guy couldnt paralell park worth a shit and kept rocking back and forth and pulling out and trying again and again and again, so this went on for like, 3 minitues.<br />
<br />
wtf?! GMC - I want to KILL you. Cars do not need this type of annoying announcement that they are backing up.<br />
<br />
While i can see the logic behind the idea, maybe have it announce once or twice if you REALLY want such a damn annoying feature. But really, does it need to belt out non stop back to back to back in a chipmunk-computer-generated voice<br />
<br />
WE GET THE IDEA, you are backing up! Not like the lights on the car were enough to get our attention, or the fact that the vechicle was well,a ctually moving backwards was notice enough.<br />

.... I hate new technology at times.</div></div><hr />

Now that was just ridiculous!</div></div><hr />

If someone that lived near me had that alarm I would probably be prompted to vandalism.</div></div><hr />

Wow, that's ingenious.  I wonder if there are any k3vv1 |)3wdz out there who've created such an interface...</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they dont want their cars to sound like a semi--poor people drive semis.</div></div><hr />

How can a door be a jar?  Jars are for holding yummy things like peanut butter, jelly, and even pickles and mayonaisse.  Doors are a magical invention that allows us to walk through walls!  It's obvious that doors are much more powerful mojo than mere jars.</div></div><hr />

Next persons car that talks to me is going to be saying something along the lines of:<br />
