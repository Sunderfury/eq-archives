			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="blogcontent restore">*Completed the Operation Final Fury (Kha'ak) plot.<br />
-Had more problems with the captain-level battle, than I did the final battle!<br />
-Of course now my combat rank is Militant, up from Veteran.  Sigh.<br />
<br />
*Added chip plex to Circle of Labor and upgraded my ore/sil plex in Tkr's Deprivation to a full chip fab with 8 or 9 chip plants and a few other &quot;Hmm, I need those&quot; factories.<br />
-Still running from Barren Shores, Light Water<br />
-Just under 43k chips left to finish the last part of the Hub.<br />
-Even added a couple Chokaro using the Supply software.  My complexes are pulling in over 10 million an hour.  I can spare the cash.<br />
<br />
*Even though my Pirate rep must be pretty darn good right now, what with the Fuel/Weed plex in Avarice, I still get one- or two-off stupid pirates attacking my stations.  It seems like those f'ers bypass the shields and get right to hull damage, because by the time I notice (10, 15 minutes or less) the station's at 5% hull or less.<br />
And it's STILL hard to repair.<br />
<br />
*Upgraded my 'plex in Legend's Home to include a few more resource products to fill voids in the neighboring sectors.<br />
<br />
*Did a LOT of station build missions in Boron and Teladi territory<br />
<br />
*Set up a half dozen new wide-spanning LTs running Springblossoms.<br />
-I'll probably buy another half dozen and start getting a few UTs up and running again.</blockquote>

-The capturing of the TLS is really stupid.  You don't gain control of it afterwards - instead it reverts to Goner control - and your marines apparently get &quot;converted&quot; to Goner, so I lost five 4-star plus marines.  :angry:<br />
-Took 8-10 reloads for that part.<br />
<br />
*Completed the New Home plot.<br />
-Twisted Skies rocks.<br />
-Ended up reloading 7 or 8 times before I realized that the sector I was jumping into, with just the Ship Debris, was the right one.<br />
<br />
*60k microchips left to finish the Hub plot.  Gonna be a while.  I didn't do any new station construction for it.<br />
<br />
*Keep getting Pirates attacking my Avarice complex.  <br />
-It's rather annoying, because I don't get timely warnings about it and when I jump in, or when my in-sector patrols finally realize wtf is happening, the station they'd targeted has taken a buttload of damage - which I can't repair unless I use my repair laser.  Painful.<br />
<br />
*The mission tracking for this game really stinks.  Some missions instantly update you as to what to do.  Others, you actually need to check the mission window to find out, instead of a popup at the bottom.</blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="blogcontent restore">*Finished the second set of Hub gates.<br />
-Left my connection between Ore Belt and CBSE.<br />
-Second connection now goes between Barren Shores and Priest Refuge.<br />
-Teladianium delivery took me less than 24 hours, what with Teladianium foundries in Presidents' End, Trinity Sanctum, and one or two other places.<br />
-Ore took 2 full days and I never experienced a shortage<br />
-Nvidium I found a portion via war drops; the rest through some annoyed mobile mining.  I still don't have the knack of that.<br />
-Crystals took 3 and a half days.  I ended up buying a good portion of them with traders, since I couldn't figure out via either of the Complex calculators how to NOT make them a zero-sum product.  Ended up spending 480+ million on that.<br />
-Set up a <u><a href="http://www.altanetworks.com/x3/x3tcocc.html?factories=xtlf,Boron,L,2;bfcl,Boron,L,2;bgf,Boron,L,2;sim,Teladi,L,1,56;sim,Teladi,L,2,38;sim,Teladi,L,1,40;sim,Teladi,L,1,36;sim,Teladi,L,1,32;sim,Teladi,L,1,30;spp,Boron,XL,1,239&amp;race=2&amp;sector=99" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Silicon Wafer complex in Barren Shores</a></u> high off the ecliptic.  Will probably end up building a companion complex in either Cho's Defeat, Depths of Silence, Elena's Fortune, or Rhonkar's Trial.<br />
<br />
*Started and finished the Treasure Hunt plot.<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>treasure hunt</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
The step that has you go into X347 I initially figured &quot;whoa really? cake&quot; until the 25 drones appeared.  And me without missiles.  So I reloaded and filled up on Mosquitoes.  4 each from range = easy pops.<br />
The step that takes you into X101 though sucked.  I entered and, right at the gate is a J, a K, 6 Q, and more fighters than would fit in one radar screen.  So I hauled ass east, way OOS, and picked off the little fighters one by one, then ended up finding the target.<br />
Was scared for a few minutes after the final step because all Teladi and NMMC were red to me until I realized my FoF settings were borked from the one attack. 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
*Picked up another Mammoth and 10 Mistral SF for storage/shuttling.<br />
<br />
*My unjoined &quot;complex&quot; of Wheat Farm, Cahoona Bakery, and SPP in Argon Prime is great for ST training, which I've been using to spread love and joy - okay, economic monopoly - throughout the eastern sectors.<br />
-I really need to get a few more into the central sectors also as well as focus some build station missions in the SE.<br />
<br />
*I finally realized why my sat/shield complex in Antigone Memorial  had a Soja Husk surplus - because I never -built- the frigging ASat factory!  So I finally delivered that and now there's even more traffic into the sector :)<br />
-I will probably be adding 2-3 more, as well as a NavSat, and maybe a few 1mj/5mj factories, depending on if the Complex Builder says I have room.<br />
-Then again, I have ore and silicon mines sitting and selling and with no CAG/CLS running product, so I might be able to swing that.<br />
-Also, it topped 1.5B credits, yes B for Billion, and I'd been frustrated with the CAG settings re: the secondary &quot;off shore&quot; account, and finally figured that out.  So now it steadily dumps credits into that account.<br />
<br />
*My spaceweed/fuel complex in Avarice is rocking the traffic lanes.  I might put another in the far SE US to try to drive economic rebuilding there.<br />
-It has made over 500M in 3 days.<br />
<br />
*Been hoarding Marines.<br />
-Outfitted all my TLs with Cargo Life Support, and all my M6 and M7, and pulled a bunch of my TPs out of CBSE, so that I can keep training them without overflow.<br />
<br />
*The only new major ship I &quot;absconded with&quot; was a Shrike, which I jumped to the Yaki SY in Senator's Badlands, until the Yaki took care of the &quot;recovery team&quot;.<br />
<br />
*Trying to figure out how best to sell goods that I collect via battles.  I keep weapons/needed goods, but when I end up with a couple thousand extra Carbo Cake, for example, I send my Mammoth3 up to Asteroid Belt, then use a couple Chokaro to &quot;Remote Best Sell.&quot;  I haven't figured out how to use CLS to sell these better as my current method is a lot of micromanagement.<br />
<br />
At this point, I can definitely say I've gotten my money's worth from the game - even if I'd paid full retail price!</blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="blogcontent restore">*Finished unlocking the first set of Hub gates.<br />
-Sadly, the Xenon force that rolled in was just a few Ls and an M, followed by a single Q... the Skiron, Thresher, Aquilo, Heavy Centaur Prototype were a bit overkill.<br />
-Also, the Q kept going after my Elephant, so I hopped OOS and the fight was over instantly in my favor.  Yay.<br />
-I was hoping the Hub had better storage, but it's just like having an Equipment Dock in my own sector. :(  Is there any way, other than dozens of Mistral SFs with full cargo holds, that I can get a very very good storage station/area?<br />
<br />
*Ended up losing 6+ hours, a complex in the Unknown Sector at the far SE, and over 50k Teladianium delivery because I didn't get any messages that the rest of my TLs got squashed by a marauding pack of Xenon, so I went back to just after the unlock.<br />
-Chose to link Ore Belt and CBSE due to the upcoming 450k Ore delivery.  Ended up moving all of my unused TS to Rhonkar's Trial so that it'd be easier to upgrade and set them all for CLS use.<br />
-The Super Shipyards can hold over 400 ships of M3-M5, TS, TM, and TP class.  Man that was a laggy window.<br />
-I looked but couldn't find a better way to control groups of a specific type of ship than the default menus.  I ended up having to manually send dozens of traders all across the map, instead of &quot;Broadcast - TS - etc&quot;.  The most granular option is &quot;TS/TP&quot;.<br />
<br />
*Got to watch the Boron go apeshit on the Paranid in Contorted Dominion, and gathered about 400 units in various missiles.<br />
-Half tempted to set up a few more Chokaro and set them to &quot;Collect wares&quot; but then there's all the micromanagement of finding them somewhere to store it...<br />
<br />
*Been doing a lot more shipyard purchasing; ended up getting three Pleco with a good selection of marines.<br />
-Averaging about 15 new/used ships a session.  Up to 531 ships.<br />
-Today's unreturned abandoned ship haul included a Heavy Nemesis, Tiger, Dragon, Katana, Gannet, Ares, and a Heavy Centaur.<br />
-The Terrans are much less angry about me blowing up their single police ship; the Split really, -really- hate it when I do.<br />
-Saw the funniest thing.  One of my shipyard purchases - a Caiman SF - ended up going through Nyana's Hideout and got attacked by a wandering pack of Xenon (Q, a few Ls) and somehow ended up getting halfway across the sector to dock safely at a station with just under 50% hull!<br />
<br />
*New complex in Trinity Sanctum is feeding the Telad very nicely, if slowly, so I added a foundry to my complex in Presidents' End.<br />
-Was thinking of putting another Telad complex in Spring of Belief, because the stations down there are Telad dry too.<br />
-Also need to configure an Ore complex in Ore Belt and also to beef up my complex in PE with some ore mines.<br />
<br />
*I think I've finally figured out how to successfully start a CLS/CAG trader.  Still a lot of intricacies with them, though.<br />
-Tried setting one to sell off the extra Tractor beams I have - almost 100 - but I can't choose any Equipment Docks or Trading stations to take them.  Ended up shutting off the TB factory.<br />
<br />
*About 50% of my Mistrals have been replaced by Chokaros, which I've set to 3-jump overlapping areas, starting with Kingdom's End.<br />
-Unfortunately, my &quot;trade dominion&quot; only covers the quadrant east of Family Whi, and north of Senator's Badlands, and the Terran areas, so the south central, south eastern, and north western areas have really floundered.  Woops.</blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="blogcontent restore">Check my email this morning.<br />
<br />
There's a dozen or so from Blizzard regarding character or guild restoration.<br />
I give them a cursory peek.<br />
Paladin restored - gear, gold.<br />
Mage - restored.  75 gold, gear.<br />
DK - restored, 0 gold, ge..<br />
<br />
wait what?<br />
So I go through and try to read them a bit better.<br />
I can't tell just by reading the alphabetical list how boned I am (though admittedly I'm less boned, just by virtue of having the restoration) but it looks like my mage's gear is PRE-3.3!  FUCK!  <br />
Over 240 badges worth of purchases, not to mention the H-ICC 5-man drops.  Oh yeah and 15k (on the mage alone) gold missing.<br />
I couldn't even easily pick apart the paladin and the death knight, what with having TWO sets of gear, tanking and dps :(<br />
<br />
Since it's maintenance day I can't tell how boned the rest of them are (though really, the sub-65s would be easy to work with, and I did get quite a lot of the guild and mule stuff back) but OMG.<br />
<br />
When do they do backups?  How can I be missing 2+ months of gear?   :angry::rlymad::wtf:<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and I haven't even been able to log into the second account to even begin to ask for a restoration on that.  (2 deletions, 1 server move).</blockquote>

I have received no contact regarding emails I have sent via this form as well as another form (whose name escapes me at the moment), just automatic emails that my account has been closed or suspended, and that a number of character transfers off my existing servers were cancelled.<br />
 <br />
I have scanned both computers that I use to access World of Warcraft extensively over the last 36 hours with a variety of tools and services, but have not discovered a method by which unauthorized access to my account was gained.<br />
I use only two computers, and I do NOT share my login information with anyone - not even my brother, whose account I pay for (and is not related to this inquiry).<br />
I was able, during the process of the account breach, to change my battle.net login password. For a brief time after the change, I was able to view the billing information etc of my account, but wasn't able to quickly determine whether or not any character moves had been triggered.<br />
When I got home from work I proceeded to change a large number of passwords that might possibly send email to the address used by the battle.net account.<br />
 <br />
While I am 99.9% certain of the sanctity and security of the two computers with which I play World of Warcraft, I have not used them for anything other than constant system scans since I first discovered the breach.<br />
 <br />
I hope to be able to convince you (&quot;you&quot; collectively meaning Blizzard Customer Service) to re-activate both my accounts so that I may undergo the recovery process for my numerous deleted characters, their equipment, etc.<br />
 <br />
I ordered a Blizzard Authenticator on 1/8/2010, three days prior to the account breach. According to the order page as well as my own bank statement, this was finally processed and charged on 1/11/2010.<br />
 <br />
Please let me know what I can do to help you help me.</div>

The second computer is used for basic surfing, but nothing so &quot;dangerous&quot; as going on Facebook or the like.<br />
<br />
Both have been scanned multiple times with multiple antivirus solutions.<br />
ClamWin.<br />
Norton.<br />
Trend.<br />
McAfee.<br />
Annoyingly, Kaspersky's online scanner is down at the moment.<br />
<br />
Nothing has been found.  No keyloggers, no trojans.<br />
I haven't received any phishing attempts.<br />
I use Adblock and Noscript in FF 3.5.7.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that somehow my password was brute-forced.<br />
I can't imagine how long it might have taken to do it, but it's very frustrating.</blockquote>

That's how I feel.<br />
<br />
I feel violated, as if someone had come into my house and eaten my porridge and slept in my bed and tried on my shoes and... okay you get the idea.<br />
<br />
I also feel like I've lost friends.  The mage and the hunter had been roleplayed with extensively for the first 3+ years of my WoW tenure; the druid not so much, the dk almost not at all.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer to get most of the gold back.  I imagine I won't.<br />
I know I probably won't get most of the mats, banked gear, etc back, which is actually kind of disappointing because I'd had stockpiles of gear for my rogue, warrior, and shaman.<br />
I really really would like to get all of the original bagged gear back, though, especially for my paladin, as she was ret/prot, my dk was dual dps/tank, and my mage had full 232+.<br />
<br />
It's been 24 hours since I first detected the hack.  22 since the accounts were suspended.</blockquote>
