There is an open and unfiltered or moderated (for the most part) wireless network in the camp dorm buildings.  In the last 6 months or so, I've noticed that connecting to WoW has been difficult to nearly impossible during my off hours.  When I can get on, my latency averages near 10k which makes doing anything, even ore farming, an act of self-torture.  The suspicion amongst the gaming segment of the workforce is that the peach nazi's have severely throttled connections to gaming servers.  Just yesterday, I was talking with one of my WoW buddies up here who told me about something he had discovered a possible workaround by way of one of those annonymous tunnelling sites, in this case gotrusted.com.  He claims that by using this service, he is able to connect to WoW servers and get sub-500 latency (trust me, that's golden up here).<br />
<br />
Last night, I decided to try this service since they offer a free 1 week trial membership.  I downloaded the file and installed it, and attempted to connect to their servers.  I got a pop-up error telling me that since I didn't have admin rights, certain settings didn't work properly.  When looking at their FAQ, it recommends temporarily disabling any non-windows (e.g. AVG, Avast) AV software and re-installing for things to work properly.  First off, should my spidey sense being going off over this?  I have heard of these annonymizers before, but never in the context of avoiding IT placed throttles, so I am not certain my friend fully understands what is going on...but maybe he's right.  Secondly, I tend to get suspicious of anything that needs me to disable my AV protection for it to work properly, so is this service &quot;safe&quot;.  And thirdly, assuming the first two conditions are met, how do I get admin rights to my own laptop?  It's a Vista OS Alienware machine that's a little over a year old.  I'm the only user, so if there is a way to permanently set the default login to be an Admin, I'd like to do that.  Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

Have you tried a right click / run as administrator?<br />
<br />
Having permanent admin rights under Vista is only possible by deactivating UAC entirely.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Also try running the software itself by right-clicking and choosing &quot;Run As Administrator.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KelanNaal</div><div class="date">March 18th, 2010, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It installs to the system tray and does not appear to have an administrator run option.</div></div><hr />

Did you choose &quot;Save File&quot; or &quot;Run File?&quot;  If you choose &quot;Save File,&quot; and save it to, say, your desktop, then you can run it as Administrator by right-clicking it so that a little menu pops up and one of the options is &quot;Run as Administrator.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KelanNaal</div><div class="date">March 18th, 2010, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I did exactly that (save as opposed to run), and it did have a run as administrator option when I installed it.  However, once installed, all I get is a little icon down in the system tray that does not have any such option. When I attempt to start a tunnelling session, it eventually times out with an error alert which reads:<br />
<br />
Unable to complete tunnel process.  Please ensure that you have administrator privileges.<br />
<br />
Now I suppose that it is possible that this message could be referring to the network and not my machine, but since this product is advertised as a way to get by The MAN&#8482;, it would seem kinda pointless to require network admin rights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alikat Astrae</div><div class="date">March 18th, 2010, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So when you installed it did you start the install file in Administrator mode or not?  That's what people have been trying to tell you needed to happen.  If you did not install it in Administrator mode, try uninstalling it and re-running the installation program in Administrator mode. <br />
<br />
 Also, if there is a shortcut in your Startup folder (sometimes autostarting tray apps use the Startup folder, sometimes they just use a registry entry instead) that needs to be set to &quot;Run as Administrator&quot; as well, that would be a tab on the Properties sheet.</div></div><hr />

The problem really, truly is your antivirus software. Some recent versions of AVG, Avast, Mcafee, and Norton with the firewall component are notorious for this and the only way to fix it is to remove them completely and re-install them without the firewall component. It's only generally a problem with software that passes network connections from one component to another or older software using the early DirectPlay networking code from MS but simply allowing the connections will not work and simply uninstalling Norton won't work (AVG/Avast/Mcafee should uninstall fine, Norton requires the removal tool).<br />
<br />
I run into this on a daily basis in another game I play because in the last 2 years or so more and more antivirus software is effectively behaving like a rootkit so the users can't &quot;open themselves up&quot; to things.<br />
<br />
I'd also make sure UPnP is disabled on your router if you have one of your own between you and the campus network and QoS packet scheduling if it's a wireless router.</div></div><hr />
