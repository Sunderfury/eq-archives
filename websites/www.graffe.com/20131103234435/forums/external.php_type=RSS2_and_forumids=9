Also annoying as hell to have to use Net to frequently look up words I *know* and cannot *see*, bloody humiliating.<br />
if they ever find a specific organism responsible for this illness, I'll rip their little fucking goolies off! <br />
And if it's down to genes, I'll tie dye the treacherous bastards in Baldrick's knob sweat! :p</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Im fairly new to the whole forum thing, never mind Graffe, so please do go easy.<br />
So ive been watching The Walking Dead recently, now that Breaking Bad and Dexters done i guess i have to. I bought compendium 1 of TWD ages ago, but only recently started reading it. I'm only on Book 8, so im not far into the series (just under half way i believe) but i know enough about it. <br />
Now to the rant, i just finished watching the new episode which i have to say was pretty horrible, one hings that annoyed me about it is the new kids. When those two girls father dies and Carol says she will look after them and treat them like her own i found a startling resemblance between that and when Alan dies in the comic and passes his twins on to Dale and Andrea, also when Carol dies and passes Sofia onto Rick and Lori. That pissed me off more than it should've, because at least they are trying to stick to the comic a little. But the main thing, the big one, is when Rick starts slicing the pigs and giving them to the zombies, the reason that pissed me off so much is that Rick showed that he felt guilty and upset. In the comic they try really hard to make you like Rick but know not to get on the bad side of him coz hes one crazy motherfucker. They've already tried to show you that in the TV show. So why did he squirm over killing a pig that his son had named? It annoys me.<br />
As i said im fairly knew to Forums never mind rants, so i do apologize. I feel like i could get a good debate on about this rather than with my too much trying to be and not in fact nerds. I know books are always better than the films, i just need to talk about this, makes me feel :banghead:<br />
Also sorry that the end is a bit rushed, my computer crashed and i lost all the main rant</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I love my wife. I am so fucking glad that for the rest of my life, so long as she and I both stay healthy, and don't do anything stupid, neither one of us will ever have to deal with the fickle world of dating - that silly, time wasting game that who knows why the other sex invented it, other than to profit on their own end, when really they're both just wasting both party's time. <br />
<br />
But i have to tell you, there are times in my job, where i wonder, &quot;why me?&quot; <br />
<br />
Those times, where I've walked into someone's home who had electrical problems, after they yelled to me through the door, a female's voice in a quivering sort of cantata, &quot;Just a minute!!!!&quot; Taking almost five, while I stare at the back bumper sticker of their Dodge Charger that says, &quot;PUSSYWAGON,&quot; wondering just what it was that gal was doing when I walk in and see a dildo on the kitchen counter, still moist. <br />
<br />
Yeah, there've been those times. They've gone even further than that. Everytime, when presented the opportunity that most pornos <i>wish</i> they could bend their imaginations around, I have to walk out, excuse myself, and make up some excuse for 10 minutes of my absence, while give the lady the opportunity to pick up after her absentminded-ness and &quot;act&quot; like I never even saw it there to begin with. <br />
<br />
THen when I walk back in, not only is the dildo still there, but two cold Miller Lites, with their caps off, and  the gal is on her laptop in the living room playing romantic country songs from Reba. I mean WTF, did you not see the ring on my finger?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, this is just another &quot;day in the life&quot; for me. One of those things I get to tell my buddies when stories get boring, and the campfire gets a little colder. <br />
<br />
But my latest building, being quite close to a UC, is packed FULL of first year away from the dorm college gals who just couldn't hold their goodies in if they tried - and TRY NOT THEY DO! <br />
<br />
If it wasn't for the fact that I joke around often enough at this UC being the Rejection one, after UCLA, Berkeley and San Diego, I'd have to think some of these gals do the things they do deliberately. Then I have to wonder, if maybe they're wired that way. <br />
<br />
<br />
There's a studio apartment full of 3 or more first-year from homers. They just unlocked the &quot;cosmetics bag&quot; enhancement, and when they answer the door, as lithe and curvaceous as they are, I wonder often to myself, &quot;Isn't makeup supposed to make you look better?&quot; I was then shown the dishwasher that overflowed with suds, EVERYWHERE throughout the kitchen. When asked if they used dishsoap, the looks of misunderstanding made it very clear what happened. The mess around them had clearly been too much, and while I went to vacuuum all the bubbles up to get to the dishwasher, one of them went to take a shower.... and while I was underneath the sink, decided to step out wearing a white t-shirt and no bra. Yes. Yes, she did look better without makeup. I can think of two reasons that are very, very, very clear. Keep my eyes on the fucking sink.</div>
