		<div>I've searched google, the main EQ forums, and this site, and haven't been able to find ANYTHING showing recent wizard aa's. :( It's really difficult finding anything EQ related these days, it seems.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, I'm playing with a fancy of returning to Everquest. If I do, it would be one of those 'all or nothing' type things. I'd focus on one character to the exclusion of everything else (I used to be quite the alt aholic), and really try to make the most of my EQ time.<br />
<br />
Right now, I have a few of my characters I'd be willing to invest time in to make this work. A level 63 monk, a level 67 wizard, a level 68 cleric, a level 70 SK, a level 71 enchanter, and a level 74 shaman (I told you I was an alt aholic). :) None of these characters has very much AA points. I suppose my enchanter has about 200 and my shaman 100, but the rest would be lucky to reach double digits for AA.<br />
<br />
I'd try to talk a few friends into coming back, so hopefully we'll have a solid group going that would be able to get to level 75 (level 80, I guess) and a solid number of AAs.<br />
<br />
Right now, if this happens, I'm leaning toward the wizard or the shaman. For this posts purposes, I'm interested in the wizard (obviously ;)).<br />
<br />
Part of the enjoyment I get from EQ is 'planning ahead', so that's why I'm here. Does anybody have a solid (total) list of AAs up to the Buried Sea expansion? In addition, is there a guide (beyond what's on the main graffe page) showing all said AAs and possible recommended 'buying' order? Failing that, and if you're REALLY bored, feel free to post below with recommendations on how to spend AAs from 0 to 400 or so (grouping / soloing wizard in mind).<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, the reason for this post is just because I could not, for the life of me, find a recent AA guide for wizards. It's actually sort of depressing - EQ used to have such a vibrant community, but it seems so barren these days, for all classes. :( C'est la vie, I guess.</div>

		<div>The community's not as vibrant as it once was, but it's not TOO too bad... it's just that you're asking a question most wizards haven't really pondered in like 5 years.<br />
<br />
I did have about 100 AAs when I unretired a year ago, though, so I've gone through a process similar to your question.  Based on experience &amp; hindsight, I would roughly prioritize them something like this:<br />
<br />
1) Run5<br />
2) Mnemonic Retention (9th spell slot -- not super-important, but great utility for only 2 AAs)<br />
3) SCM3<br />
4) Exodus<br />
5) Fire flappy<br />
6) SCS6<br />
7) Crit frequency<br />
8) Crit size<br />
9) GoM/GoRM<br />
10) Silent Casting<br />
11) Mind Crash<br />
12) Quick Damage<br />
13) Mana Regen<br />
14) Buff Slots<br />
15) Pyromancy/Cryomancy<br />
16) Stat cap<br />
17) Innate resists<br />
18) Resist cap<br />
19) Magic &amp; cold flappies<br />
<br />
That'll take you to 800 AAs or so; past that point there are still useful things to get but nothing critical.  I would recommend staying away from Manaburn &amp; Frenzied Devastation -- despite their reputation from the days of old, they cost a ton of AAs for poor benefit.</div>

Perhaps you continue to give this advice based on insider knowledge from SoF beta that doesn't allow you to justify your assertions due to the NDA.  If so, fair enough.  Otherwise, this is an even worse idea in this case than in the <a href="http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=119884" target="_blank">debate</a> on the official forums, because a returning player isn't going to have IE available to them for a while.</div>

		<div>IE isn't that far off if he's planning on concentrating solely on the wizard.  Probably less than a month and possible less than 2 weeks.  I believe I took 1 week to go from 70-75 when I returned and his accumulation of levels and AA's previously show that he already knows how to get levels.<br />
<br />
Either way, he's still probably better off leveling to 75 before getting the AA's just to have the new spells thereby making soloing/grouping easier so it's a moot point unless the poster decides to get a bunch of aa's at a level where groups are hard to get first.</div>

		<div>The 'regular group' thing fell through. Nobody really wants to start playing EQ again. Eh, whatreyagonnado?<br />
<br />
I'm still sorta considering coming back. I'm not a min-maxxer (beyond wanting to be as effective as possible as soon as possible *cough*), but I do want to make sure the character I choose to come back on will have a future in EQ.<br />
<br />
I've definitively narrowed it down to wizard and shaman (sadly on two different accounts :rolleyes: ). So do I want to make things go boom, or be a support class?<br />
<br />
My shaman can solo exceptionally well, breaking 600 dps on even con (non summoning!) mobs. With VP3, it's ridiculously easy to solo ... in certain areas. Plus the shaman was always my class to get the most group invites, which is something I want to do. Plus he's level 74, so very little grind to go to 75. 3 or 4 days just using LoD would get me the last 3/4 of the way through to 75, I would wager.<br />
<br />
But I dunno ... the wizard is really speaking to me. I'm never, ever going to be cutting edge (I just don't have the time or patience to raid) so grouping gear is the best I'm going to get. But I like that wizards aren't as gear dependant as other classes. Put in the time to get the needed AAs, get all your spells, and in most solo and grouping situations, it feels like a grouping wizard will be comparible to - or at least not blown out of the water by - a raiding wizard (of course, I could be wrong!).<br />
<br />
Plus it's fun making things blow up. :)<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, if I go wizzie, I would level to 75 (and then to 80 I guess). I'd feel bad about any groups I got in, because the dearth of AAs would vastly decrease my effectiveness, but in the long run, I do my job as well as possible, regardless of the class I'm playing, and people enjoy when I'm in a group because of my personality. And in the long run, I'd much prefer to be in a group where having fun was more important then getting the most xp in the least amount of time. Although when both those things happen, it's great. :D<br />
<br />
Point being, I still haven't decided to come back, but I have enjoyed reading the posts so far. The exceptional thing about Everquest is its massive depth of content. And because I've missed a few expansions, I'm LOST when it comes to new spells, new abilities, new quests ... basically anything at all new!<br />
<br />
So keep posting about AAs, which ones to get, which ones to avoid ... basically anything at all. :)</div>

		<div>I recently went through this ordeal of planning which AAs to get and such, and pretty much the same helpful advice is here again!<br />
<br />
From my experience though, in a group I'm just twisting FF / CBS and I can't really tell the difference that much between having the magic flappy or the fire flappy up.  In raid burn fights usually if we get a bard he's playing the fire song so I find that (or at least in theory) that if I have MR flappy up then I'm getting some benefits to both FF and CBS.  Lately I been using FF/WMS more on raids that I know I'm going to run out of mana.<br />
<br />
Chain IE/CBS sounds like a good idea in theory but so far my mana pool can't even sustain a fight doing IE none stop so can't play around with that till I'm better geared.<br />
<br />
Back on the subject of AAs I don't have Exodus yet and I haven't found the need to use it yet.  If you have Run 5 and you snare the mobs even if things go bad you just run far enough away to Evacuate and it's all good.  I do plan on picking it up pretty soon though just in case SoF content is tough.<br />
<br />
I also didn't get Run 5 until ~100 AA mark and didn't get Fire Flappy until ~350 AA mark.  Don't make that mistake - do as Kela says if you solo get those two first.<br />
<br />
Druzzil harvest is a good investment too for only a few AAs you get more mana everytime it's up.<br />
<br />
Also if you only solo - SCS6 and any other agro-reduction abilities does you absolutely no good.  I'd prioritize them with getting SCS6 early if you group a lot, and then only pick up the other stuff if you're going to raid.<br />
<br />
Oh and I don't have it yet, but I heard Arcane Overkill is a nice one to have when you solo - at level 3 you can think of it as 125 mana back each mob you kill, or something like that.<br />

As for the debate between fire, ice, or magic familiars, it may be better to look at your better focus. If you have 40% ice but only 25% fire, it'd probably be better using an ice familiar with cold snap instead of fire familiar with flashfires. I prefer the ice familiar since 50% ice is my highest focus, and then I use cold snap (spell slow on instant is nada and don't have to keep recasting rune) with cryomancy.<br />
<br />
You are a little wrong in your statement about a grouping wizard being comparable to a raiding wizard. At max, a group wiz will only have access to 30% imp dmg (katta gear) but a raider will have upwards of 65%. Raiders also have around 4-6k more mana than a grouper, so they'll be able to go longer before needing meds and such.<br />
<br />
If you plan on just grouping / soloing, don't worry about any lack of aa's you may have compared to others in the group, just play to have fun.</div>

:wtf: What wild accusatory statements?  If you're referring to the mention of SoF beta, that's me giving you the benefit of the doubt that maybe there are reasons you're not at liberty to discuss as to why you continue to promote the use of magic flappy over fire.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I haven't heard a very convincing explanation.  Ok, counting the proc, IE is slightly better DPS than SF, if you're in a situation where you're going to use those spells a lot.  (Which, incidentally, is contrary to your professed group nuking strategy of chaining instants until OOC regen.)  And WMS gets a little better DPS with magic than fire.<br />
<br />
To get those benefits, you have to use spells with worse resist checks -- typically in the mid-level content where that matters -- and give up your ENTIRE flappy bonus while soloing or using EC in situations where that's appropriate.  If you're limiting yourself to choosing one flappy, it just doesn't make sense to go for an additional 1-2% in limited situations when it means you're giving up the full 15% in the others.<br />
<br />
IE isn't impossible to get, but yeah, depending on playtime, 2-4 weeks sounds about right for most players to get the faction to get it.  Problem is, at this point, in 4 weeks the spell will be worthless.  For that matter, it's probably not really worth debating the minutia of any of the current spells since the whole landscape is changing when SoF debuts.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Anyway, Salyanye, I think you'll find that most of us here like to play wizards, oddly enough. :)  If you make your way to 75 and get your spells (even just the store-bought ones), you're going to be plenty effective in a group, and not have to feel bad about not having a huge pile of AAs or fantastic gear.  Yes, raid wizards are somewhat more effective, but not so much that you're going to feel underpowered in typical pick-up-group zones.</div>

Do you even read my posts before you respond to them?  My simple point is that if you only get ONE familiar, you're better off with the one that's good in the most situations.  If there's a good argument out there for making magic that choice, I really do want to hear it, I want to know how and why I should change my approach.  But that hasn't happened yet, and this &quot;Kela sez so&quot; type of argument doesn't cut it -- please tell me *why* Kela sez so in a way that stands up to analysis.<br />
<br />
As for Mnemonic Retention, it's fricking 2 AAs, you can get it in like 15 minutes.  A better characterization of your example would be to hand someone a guitar with 5 strings and tell them they're not allowed to spend 50 cents on the missing 6th string until they've been playing for two years.  Maybe you magic fanatics only use 3 spells in any fight, but most of the time I'm very glad I had that full complement available.</div>

		<div>I think I'll just give it a go. I mean, it will only be $15 (less! *hugs canadian dollar*) so I'm pretty sure I can cough that up. :p<br />
<br />
As for AAs, I think I'll solo for regular xp and when I'm in a group turn on full aa. With any luck I can knock out run 5 before I level to 75. After that ... well, I hope the new expansion is good to wizards. :D</div>

		<div>I've had 7 spells memmed for probably an entire week now.  Wizards don't need lots of spell gems.  If you're using that many spells at one time..you're doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
And it costs 3 AAs, not 2.  Either way...thats 3 AAs that aren't doing shit for your DPS.</div>
