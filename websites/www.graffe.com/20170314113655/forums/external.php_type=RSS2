			Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao may have accidentally let her true intentions slip during a Sean Hannity interview. <br />
<br />
&quot;What he didn’t mention is that under the current design of his proposal, Americans will be directly paying for these projects. But that was later made clear by his Transportation Secretary.<br />
<br />
In an interview with Fox News’s Sean Hannity, Elaine Chao explained that the projects will necessitate higher tolls and fees levied on the people who use them.<br />
<br />
“The federal government cannot assume the cost for all of it,” she said. Therefore, she added, “Public private partnerships are a very important part of a new way of financing our roads and bridges.”<br />
<br />
Any private firm that invests in infrastructure, however, will only do so if there’s a source of profit&#8202;—&#8202;the ability to charge people for using it&#8202;—&#8202;even if the government helps with financing.<br />
<br />
When Hannity asked Chao directly if this will mean new tolls on roads and bridges, she responded “that is certainly one example of how that would work.”<br />
<br />
“I have to say that there are some people who may not support toll roads, but we have to take a look at all of these financing mechanisms,” she said, “because once again, the needs of our infrastructure are so great that the federal government cannot and should not be the only source of funding to repair our bridges, our roads, and our energy grids.””*<br />

		<hr />
		
			WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Friday to sweep away most of the remaining vestiges of Obama administration prosecutors at the Justice Department, ordering 46 holdover United States attorneys to tender their resignations immediately — including Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan.<br />
<br />
The firings were a surprise — especially for Mr. Bharara, who has a reputation for prosecuting public corruption cases and for investigating insider trading. In November, Mr. Bharara met with then President-elect Donald J. Trump at Trump Tower in Manhattan and told reporters afterward that both Mr. Trump and Jeff Sessions, who is now the attorney general, had asked him about staying on, which the prosecutor said he expected to do.<br />
<br />
But on Friday, Mr. Bharara was among federal prosecutors who received a call from Dana Boente, the acting deputy attorney general, instructing him to resign, according to a person familiar with the matter. As of Friday evening, though some of the prosecutors had publicly announced their resignations, Mr. Bharara had not. A spokesman for Mr. Bharara declined to comment.<br />
<br />
Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said in an email that all remaining holdover United States attorneys had been asked to resign, leaving their deputy United States attorneys, who are career officials, in place in an acting capacity.<br />
 <br />
“As was the case in prior transitions, many of the United States Attorneys nominated by the previous administration already have left the Department of Justice,” she said in the email. “The Attorney General has now asked the remaining 46 presidentially appointed U.S. Attorneys to tender their resignations in order to ensure a uniform transition.”<br />
<br />
The abrupt order came after two weeks of increasing calls from Mr. Trump’s allies outside the government to oust appointees from President Barack Obama’s administration. Mr. Trump has been angered by a series of reports based on leaked information from a sprawling bureaucracy, as well as from his own West Wing.<br />
<br />
Several officials said the firings had been planned before Friday.<br />
<br />
But the calls from the acting deputy attorney general arose a day after Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator who is a strong supporter of President Trump, said on his evening show that Mr. Trump needed to “purge” Obama holdovers from the federal government. Mr. Hannity portrayed them as “saboteurs” from the “deep state” who were leaking secrets to hurt Mr. Trump. It also came the same week that government watchdogs wrote to Mr. Bharara and urged him to investigate whether Mr. Trump had violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which bars federal officials from taking payments from foreign governments.<br />
<br />
In Mr. Hannity’s monologue, he highlighted the fact that the Clinton administration had told all 93 United States attorneys to resign soon after he took office in 1993, and that “nobody blinked an eye,” but he said it became a scandal when the George W. Bush administration fired several top prosecutors midway through his second term.<br />
<br />
Several Democratic members of Congress said they only heard that the United States attorneys from their states were being immediately let go shortly before the Friday afternoon statement from the Justice Department. One senator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect the identity of the United States attorney in that state, said that an Obama-appointed prosecutor had been instructed to vacate the office by the end of the day.<br />
<br />
Although it was not clear whether all were given the same instructions, that United States attorney was not the only one told to clear out by the close of business. The abrupt nature of the dismissals distinguished Mr. Trump’s mass firing from Mr. Clinton’s, because the prosecutors in 1993 were not summarily told to clear out their offices.<br />
<br />
Michael D. McKay, who was the United States attorney in Seattle under the George Bush administration, recalled that even though he had already made plans to leave, he nevertheless stayed on for about three weeks beyond a request by then-Attorney General Janet Reno for all of the holdover prosecutors to resign. He also recalled at least one colleague who was in the midst of a major investigation and was kept on to finish it.<br />
<br />
“I’m confident it wasn’t on the same day,” he said, adding: “While there was a wholesale ‘Good to see you, thanks for your service, and now please leave,’ people were kept on on a case-by-case basis depending on the situation.”<br />
<br />
Two United States attorneys survived the firings: Mr. Boente, the top prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia, who is serving as acting deputy attorney general, and Rod Rosenstein, the top prosecutor in Baltimore, whom Mr. Trump has nominated to be deputy attorney general.<br />
<br />
“The president called Dana Boente and Rod Rosenstein tonight to inform them that he has declined to accept their resignation, and they will remain in their current positions,” said Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman.<br />
<br />
It remains possible that Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions could put others on that list later.<br />
<br />
It is not unusual for a new president to replace United States attorneys appointed by a predecessor, especially when there has been a change in which party controls the White House.<br />
<br />
Still, other presidents have done it gradually in order to minimize disruption, giving those asked to resign more time to make the transition while keeping some inherited prosecutors in place, as it had appeared Mr. Trump would do with Mr. Bharara. Mr. Obama, for example, kept Mr. Rosenstein, who had been appointed by George W. Bush.<br />
<br />
The abrupt mass firing appeared to be a change in plans for the administration, according to a statement by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee.<br />
<br />
“In January, I met with Vice President Pence and White House Counsel Donald McGahn and asked specifically whether all U.S. attorneys would be fired at once,” she said. “Mr. McGahn told me that the transition would be done in an orderly fashion to preserve continuity. Clearly this is not the case. I’m very concerned about the effect of this sudden and unexpected decision on federal law enforcement.”<br />
<br />
Still, the cases the various federal prosecutors were overseeing will continue, with their career deputies becoming acting United States attorneys in their place for the time being.<br />
<br />
Mr. Bharara has been among the highest-profile United States attorneys, with a purview that includes Wall Street and public corruption prosecutions, including of both Democratic and Republican officials and other influential figures.<br />
<br />
His office, for example, has prosecuted top police officials in New York and the powerful leader of the city correction officers’ union; they have pleaded not guilty. It is preparing to try a major public corruption case involving former aides and associates of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and is looking into allegations of pay-for-play around Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York.<br />
<br />
But Mr. Bharara is also closely associated with the Senate minority leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. Mr. Bharara was formerly a counsel to Mr. Schumer, who pushed Mr. Obama to nominate Mr. Bharara to be the top federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York.<br />
<br />
At the time of the November meeting at Trump Tower, Mr. Schumer was saying publicly that Democrats should try to find common ground and work with the president-elect. But relations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer have since soured.<br />
<br />
Mr. Trump has called Mr. Schumer the Democrats’ “head clown” and accused him of shedding “fake tears” over the president’s efforts to bar refugees from entering the United States.<br />
<br />
For his part, Mr. Schumer has called for an independent investigation into contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and demanded that Mr. Sessions resign for having testified that he had no contacts with Russians even though he had met with the Russian ambassador.<br />
<br />
The White House officials ascribed the reversal over Mr. Bharara as emblematic of a chaotic transition process. One official said it was tied to Mr. Trump’s belief in November that he and Mr. Schumer would be able to work together.

			The maximum workday for first-year medical residents just got substantially longer. The group that sets rules for training doctors announced Friday it will be scrapping the 16-hour cap on shifts worked by doctors who have just graduated from medical school.<br />
<br />
As of July 1, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education will allow these first-year residents, also known as interns, to work 24 hours without a break — and sometimes as long as 28, if a particular transition between doctors demands it.<br />
<br />
The ACGME is discarding a requirement that was implemented in 2011, arguing that the 16-hour cap simply did not deliver on its promises — and caused some new problems to boot.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Task Force [review panel] has determined that the hypothesized benefits associated with the changes made to first-year resident scheduled hours in 2011 have not been realized,&quot; the ACGME notes in its announcement of the rule changes, &quot;and the disruption of team-based care and supervisory systems has had a significant negative impact on the professional education of the first-year resident, and effectiveness of care delivery of the team as a whole.&quot;<br />
<br />
For instance, task force member Dr. Anai Kothari tells Forbes the cap would occasionally prevent doctors from seeing a treatment or surgery through from beginning to end. Patients want to know &quot;you are the doctor taking care of them,&quot; Kothari says.<br />
<br />
&quot;The long shifts are infrequent, but they are important when needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group says its conclusion is based on &quot;over 4,200 hours formulating the new requirements, including systematically reviewing over 1,000 published articles and extensive input from all stakeholders.&quot;<br />
<br />
As NPR's Rob Stein reported when the rule change was proposed in November 2016, the move has its fair share of critics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Study after study shows that sleep-deprived resident physicians are a danger to themselves, their patients and the public,&quot; Dr. Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, told Rob. &quot;It's disheartening to see the ACGME cave to pressure from organized medicine and let their misguided wishes trump public health.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Associated Press notes the American Medical Student Association and the Committee of Interns and Residents also oppose the change.<br />
<br />
The long shifts are &quot;based on a patriarchal hazing system,&quot; first-year resident Samantha Harrington tells the wire service. She says the underlying message from longtime physicians is: &quot;I went through it, so therefore you have to go through it too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The question of work hour standards appropriately provokes great emotion in both the graduate medical education community and among segments of the general public,&quot; the ACGME acknowledges in its Friday announcement.<br />
<br />
But &quot;it is important to note that 24 hours is a ceiling, not a floor,&quot; the group adds. &quot;Residents in many specialties may never experience a 24-hour clinical work period.&quot;<br />
<br />
While the ACGME is relaxing its restrictions on interns' shifts, it is maintaining previous regulations in other areas. Residents and fellows still cannot work more than 80 hours in a single week, and they must have at least one day off from clinical experience or education in any seven-day span.

			The family of a South Carolina man who died at a local hospital is now suing a “temp” doctor who operated on their loved one. The family says that the doctor went on YouTube to learn how to perform a surgery.<br />
<br />
According to WSPA, Patrick Kelly went to the Union County Medical Center in March 2016 because of a sore throat. Kelly was given medication but later rushed back to the hospital because of an allergic reaction to the medicine. The lawsuit also claims that Kelly was not properly treated throughout the incident.<br />
<br />
The New York Post notes that Kelly’s tongue and throat kept swelling, and he struggled to swallow or speak and then began to have trouble breathing. His doctor, Hani Sorour, reportedly attempted to intubate him but could not. It was then that Sorour, instead of consulting with other doctors, allegedly went on YouTube to look up how to perform a cricothyrotomy procedure to help Kelly breathe.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Sorour was unsuccessful, and Kelly died at the hospital of cardiac arrest.<br />
<br />
WSPA notes that a coroner called the Union Police Department to investigate Kelly’s death. Investigators apparently found the YouTube page still open on Sorour’s computer.<br />
<br />
Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System, which owns Union Medical Center, said that Sorour was a temporary employee hired through the company Locum Tenen, adding that Sorour was no longer practicing medicine at any of Spartanburg Regional’s hospitals after March 2016.<br />
<br />
WSPA discovered that Sorour was arrested for misdemeanor assault in Virginia in 2008. He ultimately pleaded guilty and ended up serving 20 weekends in jail. When applying for a license to practice medicine in 2011, Sorour wrote a three-page letter detailing his charges, but they were reportedly never investigated.<br />
<br />
“Any patient would want to know has my doctor been accused of a serious crime,” attorney Robert Dodson, who is representing the family, told the WSPA.

all part of the drive to destroy welfare and universal health care systems in the west so the corporations can have more money<br />
of course, that means folk like me are doomed, seen that coming for many a year.<br />

so yes, if you vote Tory or GOP, you kill folk like me. though even lot of the Labour and Democrats are in on it now, too &quot;Neoliberalism&quot;, nice sparkly  repackaging of an evil we should have made sure was dead in 1945<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So another year another required online health assessment.<br />
<br />
This year I am a 3'7&quot; Asian Female weighing 875 lbs with a 20&quot; waist (among other entertaining numbers).<br />
<br />
<br />
I still find the whole thing offensive and invasive.  If it is purely for my benefit and the data isn't used for anything they certainly wouldn't make it required and double the insurance rates if you don't do it.  Having the rates double if you don't also makes it extortion instead of an option in my mind.  I have yet to see anything that requires you to answer truthfully though.</div>

			Move over bronze bull, there’s a new statue drawing attention on Wall Street in time for International Women’s Day. <br />
<br />
On Tuesday, New Yorkers and tourists in lower Manhattan found themselves staring at a bronze little girl, with hands on her hips, staring down her famed Bovine counterpart. <br />
<br />
Installed by State Street Global Advisors, a branch of Boston-based State Street Corp., the “Fearless Girl” statue was placed in the financial heart of NYC as a call for more women to serve on corporate boards. <br />
<br />
The work is by artist Kristen Visbal, a Lewes, Del., artist who has created many bronze sculptures, ranging from sports figures to children and animals.<br />
<br />
The girl appears to be staring down the bull. Her head is held high. Her hands are firmly planted on her waist. Her pony-tail looks as if it’s in motion.<br />
 <br />
A plaque at her feet says: ‘‘Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.’’<br />
<br />
The new statue faces off the 7,000 pound “Charging Bull,” an 11-foot-tall bronze statue that has been displayed since 1989, according to The New York Times. <br />
 <br />
Sculptor Arturo Di Modica installed the bull without permits one night near the New York Stock Exchange as a tribute to the country’s recovery from the 1987 stock market crash, the Times reported. It was moved to its current location a few days later.<br />
<br />
State Street also announced that it had adopted new guidelines to press 3,500 public companies in which it invests to increase the number of women on their boards. <br />
<br />
“We believe good corporate governance is a function of strong, effective and independent board leadership,” Ron O’Hanley, chief executive officer of SSGA, said in a statement.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Setting this up in preparation for Free Agency, which starts this Thursday.<br />
Today marks the beginning of the legal tampering window, so there's a good chance of some deals getting done before Thursday.<br />
<br />
Since I'm a Niner fan, I'm obviously interested in their QB situation. I honestly have no idea what's going to happen there, but I remain cautiously optimistic.<br />
I don't see them drafting a QB with their second pick overall - there are a couple of stud DL that seem a lot more interesting to me in the draft.<br />
They'll probably grab one in the 2nd or 3rd round.<br />
<br />
I'm also interested in were Tony Romo is going to end up. I don't believe it will be with the Niners, but I also don't believe he'll ride the bench for a year.<br />
Everyone seems to be screaming &quot;ROMO TO BRONCOS!&quot;, but I'll believe it when I see it.</div>
