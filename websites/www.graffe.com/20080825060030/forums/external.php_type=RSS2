				Ray Bradbury, who has made Southern California his home since 1934, turns 88 today. He's the author of more than 30 books, countless short stories, screenplays, poetry, plays and books for children. Not only did he write &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; and &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes,&quot; he became a pop-culture futurist who has worked with everyone from Disney to rocket scientists.<br />
<br />
He's also been open and available to fans and young writers. In 2001, he advised the audience at Point Loma Nazarene University's Sixth Annual Writer's Symposium by the Sea (full video below):<br />
<blockquote><i>The problem with novels is you can spend a whole year writing one and it might not turn out well. . . . The best hygiene for beginning writers or intermediate writers is to write a hell of a lot of short stories. If you can write one short story a week -- doesn't matter what the quality is to start, but at least you're practicing. At the end of the year, you have 52 short stories, and I defy you to write 52 bad ones. Can't be done.</i></blockquote>Tomorrow Ray Bradbury be at the Mystery &amp; Imagination Bookstore in Glendale at noon sharp to celebrate his 88th birthday. At his party there last year, he accepted his Pulitzer citation -- and had cake. This year the cake has a &quot;Moby Dick&quot; theme; Bradbury wrote the screenplay for the 1956 movie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had so many heroes that I wanted to be like,&quot; Bradbury says in the Writer's Symposium video. He's been a hero to many, many more. Happy birthday, Mr. Bradbury!

				<div style="font-style:italic"> As we've suggested a few times, we are currently taking a serious look at all of the various buffs and debuffs classes can bring to parties and especially raids. A few of these changes have shown up in the recent build, and more are on the way. I'll first explain why we're doing this and then what generally we are doing.<br />
<br />
Why we think this change is necessary:<br />
<br />
1) We are adding a new class in Wrath of the Lich King as well as improving some specs that were previously viewed as inferior for PvE. Yet because the raid size is remaining at 25-players (and we expect many people with raid with 10), it may be hard to fit more people into your raid.<br />
2) We are moving almost every buff to affect the entire raid. There are only a few exceptions, and these tend to be short-term, bursty abilities. Most buffs from Battle Shout to Leader of the Pack will affect the raid.<br />
3) While we are likely to increase the debuff limit on bosses, this is a problem we keep running into. Furthermore, it asks a lot of players to be able to parse bosses with 30, 50, 100 debuffs on them. At some point, we need to stop the madness.<br />
4) Stacking a raid in order to get the right buffs has started to feel a little like a crutch, much like stacking consumables felt not so long ago. Because some of the buffs scale so well and have so much synergy with other classes, you may sometimes feel that you should pass over a really skilled player in order to pick up a buff that will bring more to you group. We'd rather get back to bringing good players or, gasp, even your friends.<br />
5) We want the challenge of the encounter to be the fight itself, not collecting all of the buffs and debuffs you need to succeed. Buffs are fun. We don't want to cut them or nerf them significantly. But we do want to make benefiting from them less of a burden.<br />
<br />
Some changes you're going to see:<br />
<br />
1) Ease and flexibility in getting all of the major buffs in the group, while still having a few spare slots to take the people you want to take.<br />
2) More parity in which classes can raid. While it's probably not realistic to get 2.5 of every class in a 25-player raid, we can get a lot closer than we are today.<br />
3) More overlap in buffs and debuffs and very few unique buffs. If you can't get player X to bring the melee haste buff, maybe you can get player Y.<br />
4) No two classes should have the same set of buffs. This is to make sure that one class can't completely replace another. If you have two players both bringing melee haste, there is a good chance one of them also brings something else you need. Again, the goal is flexibility.<br />
<br />
A few examples:<br />
<br />
1) To get a spell damage vulnerability debuff on a boss, you can bring a a warlock for Curse of Elements or a death knight for Ebon Plague. They don't stack, but both classes also bring additional benefits in case you want to run with both. The lock brings Curse of Recklesness, Demonic Pact, Curse of Weakness, Blood Pact and Fel Intelligence (depending on spec). The death knight brings Abomination's Might, Improved Icy Talons, various Auras, and a new Str + Agi buff you haven't seen yet (again depending on spec).<br />
2) To get a 5% melee crit bonus, you can bring a Feral druid for Leader of the Pack or a Fury warrior for Rampage.<br />
3) While having a mana battery feels essential in many cases, you can now bring a Shadow priest, Retribution paladin or Survival hunter to fill the role.<br />
4) You can improve health of the entire raid with Commanding Shout or Blood Pact. You don't need both, so perhaps the warrior can Battle Shout or the lock can bring out another pet instead.<br />
<br />
I want to stress that none of this is set in stone. A change like this is going to take some iteration until it feels right. While we are pretty happy with the plan, it is certainly possible that some class or spec is going to be hurt by a change more than we anticipated. We don't want to hurt anyone's viability while soloing, in small groups, or in PvP with this change. We aren't trying to slap anyone in the face -- we're trying to make the game more fun.<br />
<br />
The goal is to get more people into raids and to let you bring the people you want. Ultimately, that should benefit everyone. Please try and keep that in mind as you start to see the changes.</div>

</div>This all sounds very good and very healthy to me, and it forms a good basis for adding future classes to the game as well. Obviously proper implementation is a big part of making this work, though.</div>

What's the best way to get geeks or small boys to tidy their rooms? Pretend it's a swords and sorcery role playing game... <br />
Screengrab from Chore Wars, the online game which lets you swap household chores for experience points. <br />
<br />
Tom Whitwell <br />
ChoreWars.com is an online role-playing game in which competitors complete real-life household tasks to win. Tackling the dishwasher becomes loading or unloading the enchanted cabinet of crockery washing, for which you can get ten gold pieces. You might find treasure, or meet a water goblin or tentacle beast. You register your household, everyone starts recording their efforts, and the place gets tidier. <br />
<br />
It was started last year by London-based web developer Kevan Davis, when he was living with a group of geeks moaning about housework. So far, more than 70,000 people have signed up. <br />
<br />
One mum writes: I sat down with the kids, showed them their characters and the adventures and they ran off to complete their tasks. Ive never seen my eight-year-old son make his bed! <br />
<br />
Being family-friendly doesnt come naturally to online gamers. One news entry reports: After feedback from family users, the wandering monster images have been toned down to have fewer spikes and teeth.

The queue icon on my map flashed indicating I was in the queue, but beyond that I never got any indication of what was to happen next.  Was I supposed to go somewhere?  Or was I just added to the list, and when my spot came up I'd be ported there?  What was this all about? :)<br />

If it's similar to something in WoW, that won't help as I didn't play PvP in WoW, so the more detailed the explanation, the better for me :)<br />

Also, you recall the great scene in &quot;Running Man&quot; where the guys in the TV booth used CGI to make it look like a &quot;stunt&quot; character who got killed, was Arnie Schwarze's character, by using a computer program?<br />
<br />
Ok, that was Hollywood 15 years ago...it's real NOW. Saw it elsewhere, can't recall link at moment, but basically, they can add say, a moustache to a perosn on a video, and it will blend and &quot;stick&quot; to the perosn for rest of the scene without need for re-doing it for eveyr frame...or they could add a new face...<br />

				Solar plane makes record flight  <br />
By Jonathan Amos <br />
Science reporter, BBC News  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Solar plane's 3 day flight<br />
<br />
A UK-built solar-powered plane has set an unofficial world endurance record for a flight by an unmanned aircraft. <br />
<br />
The Zephyr-6, as it is known, stayed aloft for more than three days, running through the night on batteries it had recharged in sunlight. <br />
<br />
The flight was a demonstration for the US military, which is looking for new types of technology to support its troops on the ground. <br />
<br />
Craft like Zephyr might make ideal platforms for reconnaissance. <br />
<br />
They could also be used to relay battlefield communications. <br />
<br />
Chris Kelleher, from UK defence and research firm QinetiQ, said Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer advantages over traditional aircraft and even satellites. <br />
<br />
&quot;The principal advantage is persistence - that you would be there all the time,&quot; he told BBC News. &quot;A satellite goes over the same part of the Earth twice a day - and one of those is at night - so it's only really getting a snapshot of activity. Zephyr would be watching all day.&quot; <br />
<br />
Deployment close <br />
<br />
The latest flight was conducted at the US Army's Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona. <br />
<br />
The Zephyr flew non-stop for 82 hours, 37 minutes.   <br />
<br />
That time beats the current official world record for unmanned flight set by the US robot plane Global Hawk - of 30 hours, 24 minutes - and even Zephyr's own previous best of 54 hours achieved last year. <br />
<br />
However, the Yuma mark remains &quot;unofficial&quot; because QinetiQ did not involve the FAI (Federation Aeronautique Internationale), the world air sports federation, which sanctions all record attempts. <br />
<br />
The US Department of Defense funded the demonstration flight under its Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) programme. <br />
<br />
This programme is designed to advance the technologies American commanders would most like to see in the field. <br />
<br />
&quot;We think Zephyr is very close to an operational system - within the next two years is what we're aiming for,&quot; Mr Kelleher said. &quot;We have one more step of improvements; we trying to design a robust and reliable system that will really sit up there for months; and we want to push the performance.&quot; <br />
<br />
Energy density <br />
<br />
The trial, which took place between 28 and 31 July, also included the participation of the UK Ministry of Defence. <br />
<br />
The 30kg Zephyr was guided by remote control to an operating altitude in excess of 18km (60,000ft), and then flown on autopilot and via satellite communication. <br />
<br />
It tested a communications payload weighing approximately 2kg.  <br />
Zephyr should be in commanders' hands within two years <br />
<br />
At first sight, the propeller-driven Zephyr looks to be just another model aircraft, and it is even launched by hand. But this &quot;pilotless&quot; vehicle with its 18-metre wingspan incorporates world-leading technologies. <br />
<br />
Its structure uses ultra-lightweight carbon-fibre material; and the plane flies on solar power generated by amorphous silicon solar arrays no thicker than sheets of paper. These are glued over the aircraft's wings. <br />
<br />
To get through the night, the propellers are powered from lithium-sulphur batteries which are topped up during the day. <br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of effort has gone into power storage and light-weighting the systems,&quot; explained Mr Kelleher. &quot;Lithium sulphur is more than double the energy density of the best alternative technology which is lithium polymer batteries. <br />
<br />
&quot;They are an exceptional performer. We've worked with the Sion Corporation. They've had them in development for years. We're actually the first application in the world for them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Vulture venture <br />
<br />
Zephyr has demonstrated that it can cope with extremes of temperature - from the blistering 45C heat found at ground level in Arizona's Sonoran Desert, to the minus 70C chill experienced at altitudes of more than 18km (60,000ft). <br />
<br />
The engineers from the Farnborough-based company are now collaborating with the American aerospace giant Boeing on a defence project codenamed Vulture. <br />
<br />
This would see the biggest plane in history take to the sky, powered by the sun and capable of carrying a 450-kilo (1,000lb) payload. <br />
<br />
US commanders say the design must be able to maintain its position over a particular spot on the Earth's surface uninterrupted for five years. <br />
<br />
QinetiQ is also developing UAV technology for civilian uses. <br />
<br />
It has been working recently with Aberystwyth University on field monitoring trials, plotting areas of ground that may or may not need fertiliser applications. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Lightweight plane (30-34kg/70lb) is launched by hand<br />
Coms or surveillance payload of about 2kg (4.5lb)<br />
Flies autonomously and can climb to more than 18km (60,000ft)<br />
By day, Zephyr flies on solar power and recharges its batteries<br />

Rechargeable lithium-sulphur batteries supplied by Sion Corp

It's very rare that you find yourself cheering on the most vivacious, outrageous, dangerous, and sensuous of criminals. <br />
<br />
Carmen Sandiego took us through The USA, Europe, The World, Space, and Time itself. <br />
<br />
I've played most of the games growing up. It was fun and educational. <br />
<br />
I remember both the game shows and the Fox Cartoon, featuring the most annoying AI ever.<br />
<br />
[media]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2jpE1kPnzk[/media]<br />
(love that theme song)<br />
<br />
Taking this in another direction, nowadays I realize just how dead sexy Carmen really is. I remember her dossier read that she loves spicy foods and has a taste for Fine jewelery. You can't argue with that. Tall; long, dark brown hair; crimson clothing in an almost Film Noir detective style, revealing nothing and maintaining the Feminine Mystique while she lures us to catch her in a cat and mouse game where the truth is that she cannot be had, only chased, and chase the Femme Fatale we did! <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but damn, that's sexy.<br />
<br />
Despite her classiness (Take note, Ladies!), <br />
she <br />
stole <br />
EVERYTHING!<br />
She does her own stunts, even! <br />
<br />
For example, Look at the cartoon series....SHE TRIED TO STEAL THE STATUE OF FREAKING LIBERTY! She JUMPS off and flies away in a freaking jetpack better than most Tribes players and rocketman combined!<br />
<br />
Another point: brilliant opening: a strange crime &#8211; suddenly, from the dark nature to a celebration &#8211; we are confused. The chorus sings amidst Chinese new year as we realize we are in a glorious game of cat and mouse as Carmen Sandiego is standing triumphant on a rooftop, stealing what looks like an oni, she jumps away and throws a clue to the young detectives, enticing them to pursue her. <br />
<br />
Later, at the statue of liberty scene, she's seen expecting them, her hands on her hips as she grins and tips her hat at them, archs her back and jumps off the building, jet-packing away to continue the chase.<br />
<br />
The games were also great. I usually got my coffee in the office to stand upright, but otherwise I still want the goddamned machine fixed and have all vending abominations like it destroyed. I also learned early on the need to avoid Charges of False Arrest. <br />
<br />
Carmen Sandiego is a Sexy Badass who reminds us how important History is.</div>

			<description>Assuming a budget of 250k, where in America would be the best locations to build a nuclear fall out shelter. I need access to solid bedrock, and uncorrupted aquifer, and enough storage to accommodate 3-4 families food and energy needs for at least 30 years.
