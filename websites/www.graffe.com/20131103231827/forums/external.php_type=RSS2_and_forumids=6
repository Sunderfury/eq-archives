			Simone de Beauvoir called it “a small person … an alter ego usually more sly … and more clever than the individual.” Leonardo da Vinci said it “has dealings with human intelligence and sometimes displays an intelligence of its own.” Sophocles said that having one was to be “chained to a madman.”<br />
<br />
These great thinkers were referring so exasperatedly, so powerlessly, to none other than the penis. That’s a lot of hype for a body part that can “be seen as something the Creator doodled in an idle moment,” as Tom Hickman puts it in the new book, “God’s Doodle: The Life and Times of the Penis.” Then again, our fascination with the penis has long belied its relatively small size (the average one is believed to be 6.2 inches long when erect). It’s fitting, then, that Hickman, a journalist, has written an expansive history of the male member covering everything from biological explanations of its shape and size to analysis of phallic myths.<br />
<br />
It’s a well-researched, dryly witty and worthwhile read. But even a history of the penis can use some … snipping. Below, you’ll find the top 10 most surprising facts about the penis — from monkey-ball implants to broken johnsons.<br />
<br />
10. Every penis was a clitoris<br />
<br />
That sounds like the title of a children’s book, doesn’t it? But, seriously, Hickman explains, ”Every penis in the womb starts as a clitoris before hormones ‘sex’ the brain of the to-be male.” The penis “retains the mark of its female heritage: its dark underskin and the thin ridge or seam, known as the raphe, which runs from scrotum to anus, are remnants of the fusion of the vaginal lips.”<br />
<br />
9. Fetuses have erections<br />
<br />
That’s right, and ultrasound scans prove it. “So many newborn males greet the world with an erection that the sexologist William Masters in his earlier obstetric days set himself the challenge of trying to cut the umbilical cord before it happened,” writes Hickman.<br />
<br />
8. Before there was Viagra, there were monkey balls<br />
<br />
They didn’t have Cialis ads at the turn of the century, but they did have monkey-ball transplants. In order to cure impotence, doctors began experimenting with xenotransplantation: surgically transplanting testicles from goats, chimpanzees and baboons into male humans. “Thousands of men around the world in the 1920s went under the knife for the supposed benefits of what were known as ‘monkey glands,” he says. By the way, it didn’t work.<br />
<br />
ADVERTISEMENT<br />
<br />
7. Red meat, funky spunk<br />
<br />
Asparagus gets a bad rap for causing gnarly-tasting semen, but “red meat and dairy produce are said to result in the least pleasant flavour.” I suspect an information-suppression campaign by Ruth’s Chris.<br />
<br />
6. Ejaculate: The low-calorie treat<br />
<br />
Taste aside, semen “contains only one to seven calories,” says Hickman. That’s about the same as a cup of fresh spinach — but don’t expect to see ejaculate added to your Weight Watchers points system any time soon.<br />
<br />
5. The big-balled cheater<br />
<br />
“Testicular research of a more sociological kind has deduced that men with large testicles are likely to be more unfaithful, the converse being true of men with small testicles,” says Hickman. Thus, he advises, with tongue firmly planted in cheek: “A woman” — or man, I would add — “seeking a reliable long-term partner might be advised to invest in an orchidometer,” a medical instrument designed for measuring balls.<br />
<br />
4. Penises can actually break<br />
<br />
“Every year at least two hundred Americans, and thirty to forty Britons break their erect penis,” writes Hickman. Most do so during “violent intercourse.” But there are also cases where men snap their member — indeed, Hickman notes that such incidents are accompanied by an audible crack — by falling out of bed with an erection. The cure for a broken penis? Six weeks of bed rest with a penis splint.<br />
<br />
3. Masturbation panic popularized circumcision<br />
<br />
King Louis XVI of France was circumcised because of a too-tight foreskin, which caused the procedure to become “fashionable among the aristocracy,” says Hickman. But ”what made circumcision common among the proliferating nineteenth-century middle classes on both sides of the Atlantic was the hysteria about masturbation; removing the foreskin helped its prevention, doctors declared, and also cured bed-wetting and other conditions.”<br />
<br />
2. The Lorena Bobbitt effect<br />
<br />
When Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband’s penis, it spawned a “worldwide phenomenon,” says Hickman. “Across America, and from China to Peru, copycat cases began to occur, with Thailand becoming the epicenter: By the end of the millennium, over a hundred cases had been reported to Thai police, who admitted there were probably many more but the victims preferred to keep their loss to themselves.” Hickman reports cases of women feeding dismembered penises to farm-life and one wife in India who attached her husband’s severed member to a helium balloon.<br />
<br />
1. The world’s largest penis<br />
<br />
The largest penis ever to be medically verified was 13.5 inches long and 6.25 inches in circumference. Just to put that in perspective, the average vagina is three to four inches deep.

MPs' pay: the truth about the so-called pension cuts<br />
<br />
The proposal to raise MPs' pay to £74,000 got the headlines, but what seems to have slipped under the radar is the suggestion that this will also increase their pensions – contrary to claims<br />

MPs in the house of Commons on the way to the opening of parliament <br />
To achieve their current pension on the open market MPs would need to save about £60,000 a year for every year they are in parliament. Photograph: Graeme Robertson<br />
<br />
<br />
When the news broke that, on the recommendation of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), MPs might get a £7,600 pay rise, it was balanced by talk of a cut in their pensions. But closer reading of the report reveals that if the proposals are adopted, existing MPs could actually see their retirement income rise – at a cost of at least £10m to taxpayers.<br />
<br />
<br />
IPSA's proposal that MPs' salaries increase to £74,000 grabbed the headlines, but what seems to have slipped under the radar is its suggestion that this pay rise should also immediately increase the pensions earned by MPs to date. IPSA says it has been told this might cost £10m; I think it could easily be closer to £25m.<br />
<br />
<br />
IPSA has failed to examine the pension scheme from the perspective of its value to the MP. Instead it has focused on the estimates of the cost of the pension to the taxpayer. The scheme is extremely generous and forms a much bigger element of pay than is usual in this country. This flawed approach to its evaluation has serious consequences for the pay review as a whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have calculated the value of the pension to an MP based on what he or she would have to spend to achieve the same retirement income from a private scheme:<br />
<br />
<br />
• To achieve their current pension on the open market MPs would need to save about £60,000 a year for every year they are in parliament. They actually only contribute £9,100, so they are getting a benefit worth £51,000 a year, or 75% of pay. Contrast this to IPSA's view of the value of the pension: it says it costs the taxpayer 20.4% of MPs' pay or £14,000 a year.<br />
<br />
<br />
• After the pay rise an MP with 15 years of service will get an extra £2,850 a year in retirement. On the open market this would need a pension fund of £100,000 to provide. Across 600 MPs this translates to about £60m of value.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is going to be very difficult to bridge the gap between what pensions might cost the taxpayer and what they are worth to MPs because the amounts are so great. But it seems pretty clear that existing MPs are not facing a pension cut.<br />
<br />
<br />
IPSA said its pay review would be guided by five principles: it would make MPs' pay modern, transparent, fair, sustainable, and lastly treat them as professionals. But it has failed to apply its own principles to their pensions.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it wanted to be modern it could move towards paying a percentage of pay as a pension contribution each year into each MPs' fund, rather than offering a guaranteed pay out. This would aid transparency – the current pension scheme's formulae and potential costs are so complex that even the pay review body can't show it has considered them properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
The existing scheme requires regular reviews, which show the cost of the pension regularly rising. The scheme had a deficit of £55m at its last formal review in April 2011 – increasing that by more than £10m doesn't feel particularly sustainable. The cost estimates of the scheme to the taxpayer are continually shown to be too low.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is hard to be fair when you have a complex benefit whose value or cost is so difficult to predict. Any change to the pension rules could be considered unfair to the recipient, but other public service staff have seen their pension scheme changed. The proposed changes to MPs' pensions are unfair in that they give them a significant immediate rise in their pension which no other public sector group of employees has received.<br />
<br />
<br />
In failing to examine pensions properly, IPSA cannot claim to have achieved its goals of settling the issue of MPs' rewards. In leaving behind a complex, opaque pension system which hides the true value of very generous benefits, IPSA leaves behind a ticking timebomb that will explode at a later date when the true cost of MPs' pensions become obvious.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>School is finally paying off.   I finally am working in my new career!  I started a new job (contract to hire) in September in my new profession as a developer (my title is Software Engineer) for an international financial company that seems to like to buy lots of smaller insurance companies.  It's been quite a change going from mainly a legal assistant career to writing code for web applications and I am loving every minute of it.  While going to school I had a few short term contract jobs, but even those did not prepare me for what I am doing today.  <br />
<br />
My first day, they showed me my desk, and gave me a computer and said...if you have any questions, ask the guy next to you.  That was the extent of my training.  I work in Visual Studio 2010 and program in VB.net (although I only had one class in VB, the rest of my courses were C#).   The project solution has 11 total projects within it and well over 15,000 files and I write the code for commercial insurance products, specifically for crime line of business.  I should be made a regular hire by the end of my contract if all goes well.  If not, it's more experience than any of the previous contract jobs I had previously, so its a huge step forward for me regardless.  That, and I do have a few free-lance website client's that are always throwing more work my way.<br />
<br />
My brain has been on overload since I started working there, and the only drawback is the commute time I have daily.  I leave at 6:30 in the morning or earlier, and get home between 6:30 and 7 at night.  Between work, grad school (I am almost done), and my free lance work, I am pretty much brain dead these days...but I am loving it!   It's been a long 5 years since I lost my last job in my former career.  Things are finally starting to look promising. :D</div>

Germany allows 'indeterminate' gender at birthComments (864) <br />
The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says that it's not yet clear what this will mean for German law on marriage<br />
Continue reading the main story <br />

Australia endorses gender choice <br />
Q&amp;A: How do you define sex? <br />
<br />
Germany has become Europe's first country to allow babies with characteristics of both sexes to be registered as neither male nor female.<br />
<br />
Parents are now allowed to leave the gender blank on birth certificates, in effect creating a new category of &quot;indeterminate sex&quot;.<br />
<br />
The move is aimed at removing pressure on parents to make quick decisions on sex assignment surgery for newborns.<br />
<br />
However, some campaigners say the new law does not go far enough.<br />
<br />
As many as one in 2,000 people have characteristics of both sexes.<br />
<br />
'Bruised and scarred'<br />
 Sarah Graham, intersex woman and counsellor: &quot;This pink and blue thing is a nonsense&quot;<br />
<br />
They are known as &quot;intersex&quot; people because they have a mixture of male and female chromosomes or even genitalia which have characteristics of both genders. <br />
<br />
The intense difficulty for parents is often that a gender has to be chosen very quickly so that the new child can be registered with the authorities, the BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin reports.<br />
<br />
Sometimes surgery is done on the baby to turn its physical characteristics as far as possible in one direction or the other, our correspondent says. <br />
<br />
The law in Germany has been changed following a review of cases which revealed great unhappiness. <br />
<br />
In one case, a person with no clear gender-defining genitalia was subjected to surgery. The person said many years later: &quot;I am neither a man nor a woman. I will remain the patchwork created by doctors, bruised and scarred.&quot; <br />
<br />
German passports, which currently list the holder's sex as M for male or F for female, will have a third designation, X, for intersex holders, according to the interior ministry.<br />
<br />
Silvan Agius, ILGA-Europe: &quot;It does not address the surgeries... and that's not good&quot;<br />
<br />
It remains unclear what impact the change will have on marriage and partnership laws in Germany.<br />
<br />
Current laws define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and civil partnerships are reserved for same-sex couples.<br />
<br />
Silvan Agius of IGLA-Europe, which campaigns for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex people, said the law needed to go further.<br />
<br />
&quot;While on the one hand it has provided a lot of visibility about intersex issues... it does not address the surgeries and the medicalisation of intersex people and that's not good - that has to change,&quot; he told the BBC.<br />
<br />
While Germany is the first country in Europe to legally recognise a third gender, several other nations have already taken similar steps.<br />
<br />
Continue reading the main story <br />
Third gender recognition<br />
Australia - passport applications since 2011<br />
Bangladesh - passport applications since 2011<br />
Germany - on birth certificates from 2013<br />
India - electoral roll since 2009<br />
Nepal - census since 2007<br />
New Zealand - passport applications since 2012<br />
<br />
Australians have had the option of selecting &quot;x&quot; as their gender - meaning indeterminate, unspecified or intersex - on passport applications since 2011. A similar option was introduced for New Zealanders in 2012.<br />
<br />
In South Asia, Bangladesh has offered an &quot;other&quot; gender category on passport applications since 2011. <br />
<br />
Nepal began recognising a third gender on its census forms in 2007 while Pakistan made it an option on national identity cards in 2011.<br />
<br />
India added a third gender category to voter lists in 2009.<br />
<br />
While transgender or intersex people have long been accepted in Thailand and are officially recognised by the country's military, they do not have any separate legal status.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Police have been called to a branch of Asda after a man was seen wandering the aisles wearing a full Nazi SS uniform.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The incident occurred in a Cambridge branch of the supermarket yesterday afternoon, with a 48-year-old local man taking to Twitter today to claim responsibility. <br />
<br />
Using the Twitter handle Operation Fail Safe, Paul Dutton said: &quot;I got ejected from #ASDA for wearing something that is good enough for a #Prince 2 wear #Asda are a bunch of #Racists&quot;.<br />
<br />
He added: &quot;I wear a Black SS armband in Asda twice a week for past 3 years... I've shopped in Asda since the place was opened twice a week, this is how Asda repay me for my loyalty&quot;.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere on his Twitter page, which is adorned with images of Adolf Hitler and photographs of Nazi tattoos, Mr Dutton claimed that he had visited the supermarket to hand out cards promoting his website, which he says explains his reasons for wearing a Nazi outfit.<br />
<br />
Officers confirmed that attended the scene but a spokeswoman said: &quot;By the time we got there he had already left peacefully.&quot;<br />
<br />
The supermarket's manager said he asked the man to leave the Beehive Centre store after receiving a number of complaints from horrified shoppers, with several taking to social media to voice their anger. Many originally assumed the outfit was a Halloween prank.<br />
<br />
Hayley Dunn tweeted: “Just saw a man dressed up as a Nazi officer covered in swastikas in Cambridge Asda! That is not cool man, not cool #badcostume.”<br />
<br />
Speaking to the Cambridge News, Rosina Rusin, whose father was Polish and mother was of Dutch-Jewish descent, said: “I wanted to make sure he was evicted. My grandmother's family were annihilated in the gas chambers and I thought here is this bloke parading about.... One lady was very upset - she was close to crying.”<br />
<br />
The 60-year-old added: &quot;I was waiting in a queue when a lady came up and she was really quite distressed about it... People's mouths were falling open. You are not going to come out like that unless you want to draw attention to yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
A spokeswoman for Asda said: &quot;We had a number of customer complaints so we asked him to leave the store.&quot;<br />
<br />
Last month Asda was itself criticised over a Halloween costume, withdrawing an outfit that campaigners say stigmatised people with mental health issues.<br />
<br />
The store made a donation to mental health charity Mind as an apology.<br />

<br />
Response to ATOS debate causes Council meeting to be suspended<br />
<br />
<br />
October 31, 2013 by Grace Franklin <br />
<br />
<br />
Protesters outside the City Chambers made their Anti- Atos feelings clear.<br />
<br />
Labour Councillers were told they had ‘blood on their hands’ at a stormy  meeting of Glasgow City Council today. (Thursday 31 October 2013)<br />
<br />
Shouted from the public gallery after a motion to removed ATOS as a corporate sponsor of the 2014 Commonwealth Games was defeated, several people there loudly condemned the Councillors. One man was arrested and charged with alleged breach of the peace.   Police Scotland (Strathclyde) say a report has been sent to the Procurator Fiscal.<br />
<br />
The motion was moved by SNP Councillor Billy McAllister from Canal Ward 16.<br />
<br />
While recognising the ‘immense economic and social benefits’ to be derived from the 2014 Commonwealth Games and commending the international exposure which Scotland and Glasgow would receive from the Games, Councillor McAllister said: ‘ATOS must go as a sponsor. This is a company without any conscience. It is destroying lives.’<br />
<br />
He gave details of individuals who had been assessed by ATOS Health Care as fit to work. One died within weeks of being declared fit for work. Another committed suicide. Said Councillor McAllister: ‘At least 10,000 people have been declared fit for work. ATOS is an ugly stain on our society. Their costly contract should be pulled. I do not wish to accept the shocking damage ATOS is doing to Glasgow’s citizens.<br />
<br />
Even as people in the public gallery applauded him, the Lord Provost gave him a dressing down for being ‘disrespectful’ of her by continuing to speak well beyond the time permitted.<br />
<br />
SNP Councillor John Letford of Maryhill/Kelvin Ward15, supported the motion to removed ATOS as a sponsor of the Games. He said ‘ATOS is the problem, not the solution.’ He called on people working for the health care assessment sector of the company who believed in social justice to follow their conscience and move to another job. ‘We must remove this monster called ATOS,’ he said.<br />
<br />
But Labour Councillor Archie Graham for Langside Ward 7, who is Executive Member for the Games said: ‘You must separate ATOS health care from the Games sponsor ATOS which is a different arm of the company.’ He accused  the SNP Councillors  of attempting to damage the Commonwealth Games. He produced a picture of Nicola Sturgeon, SNP Deputy First Minister ‘enthusiastically participating’ in a Commonwealth Games lead-in event  where she was being ‘cheered on’ by ‘the man from ATOS.’ He said it had been decided that ATOS was capable of delivering the Games’ services. ‘It is now impossible to distance ourselves from them. Where would the billions of pounds of sponsorship come from now?’ he queried.<br />
<br />
Both Green Party Councillor Martha Wardrop for Hillhead Ward 11 and First Glasgow Councillor Stephen Dornan for Govan Ward 5 spoke out strongly against retaining ATOS as a sponsor for the Games.<br />
<br />
Councillor Wardrop said she strongly criticised ATOS and the way it treated people being assessed. But challenged the Labour group that their concern was ‘All about the money they are bringing to the Games.’<br />
<br />
Councillor Dornan urged Labour Group members to vote with their conscience. ‘Money can never replace people. That’s your choice.’<br />
<br />
In his final response, Councillor McAllister said to Councillor Graham directly: ‘Shame on you if you put profit before people. You can’t say this is outwith your area. This is about our constituents in Glasgow. If you don’t vote with your conscience, this will come back to haunt you. This should not be about party politics,’ he warned.<br />
<br />
The final vote was 29 for Councillor McAllister’s motion and 42 against.<br />
<br />
At that point the public gallery erupted with people shouting down to the Councillors and throwing down handfuls of monopoly money.<br />
<br />
One man shouted: ‘How will the disabled athletes look on this?’<br />
<br />
As the police intervened in the public gallery the Lord Provost closed the Council session. Most Councillors re-assembled after a 20 minute break to continue the business of the day.<br />
<br />
<b>During the recess Councillor McAllister said he was very angry about the whole issue. ‘A lot of Labour Councillors said to me privately they’d like to support this motion but the Labour Group have whipped them into voting against it. It shows the state of Labour in Glasgow when they can’t vote with their conscience. We govern the city. If we don’t condemn the way ATOS goes about its health business we are condoning it.’</b><br />
<br />
Before the Council meeting re-convened, Councillor Graham called Councillor McAllister’s conduct ‘an outrage.’<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've been battling insomnia for my entire adult life, and for the most part, as far back into being a teenager as well. Problem was, when I was younger, I just didn't really care, and I had my mom to yell at me in the morning to get up, and I ussually slept through 1st and 2nd period throughout middle school, and high school, until I would finally be awake around the lunch hour, and for the rest of the day - then in the evening, I'd stay up until 3 or 4am, or until I passed out or not at all, and then rinse, repeat. <br />
<br />
Until I turned 21, I avoided sleep when at all possible, and when I could forsee a large amount of time coming where I could crash, I would just pass out wherever i was for several hours, sometimes days at a time (yes, days, occasionally broken up by just enough of 10 minutes to poop, pee, maybe drink some water, and then pass out again). After 21, I just bought beer and passed out that way. <br />
<br />
That worked well enough until my tolerance became so large, combined with being invited out to drink with friends, and tilting back so many more beers than any in my present company just to be on the same level as them, that the convenience of having 1 beer to fall asleep at night, turned into 2 beers, then 3, then 2 tall boys, then a six pack - so on and so forth. <br />
<br />
About 4 years ago, I decided to go see my physician about it. Mostly everything test wise came back decent, so he prescribed me a few different prescription sleeping pills on the condition that I only take one at a time, and I stick with one for a week, and then try the other for a week, etc etc, until I had an established sleep cycle. <br />
<br />
Ambien seemed to work the most reliably. Lunesta, on occasion, would either leave me sleep walking (in one case, I actually sleep drop into work 4 hours than I needed to be there, before waking up from a haze in the back office, suddenly realizing what I'd done - then I slept off the remaining 4 hours of the drug) or would just not work at all. Eventually Ambien just didnt' work the same, despite spanning the number of days between taking it. <br />
<br />
I eventually, through recommendation of a friend, started taking Benadryll every once in a while, if I truly couldn't force myself asleep. That always has seemed to work even better than Ambien, even. Yay 1st generation Antihistamine!<br />
<br />
So I've gotten really tired of basically injecting myself with loads of different things that realy shouldn't be in my body just in order to do something, that to others, comes naturally. As much as I'd like to go back to my college days, normal day to day life just doesn't allow that kind of freedom.<br />
<br />
After a bit of research on my own, I've discovered that many sufferers of insomnia are also computer/screen addicts (hey, that's me!), and the most common cure-all, besides unplugging (funny, when i go camping with friends I have no trouble sleeping, at all) - is light filtration; removing blue and green light from observed spectrum. <br />
<br />
I'd been experimenting the past month with changing the monitor's lighting through software. It helped. <br />
<br />
I played a little bit with some acetate filters - it helped a little bit more. <br />
<br />
Now I just received, today, a set of filter glasses from Honeywell - I can't stop yawning. I've only worn them the last 40 minutes, but  atrip to the grocery store, and this post, and I am just about asleep as it is. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'll post a link if anyoen else suffers from insomnia like I do, but just thought I'd fill y'all in.</div>

<br />
(CNN) -- Before the transcontinental race in &quot;Cannonball Run,&quot; the starter tells the gathered racers, &quot;You all are certainly the most distinguished group of highway scofflaws and degenerates ever gathered together in one place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ed Bolian prefers the term &quot;fraternity of lunatics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Where the 1981 Burt Reynolds classic was a comedic twist on a race inspired by real-life rebellion over the mandated 55-mph speed limits of the 1970s, Bolian set out on a serious mission to beat the record for driving from New York to Los Angeles.<br />
<br />
The mark? Alex Roy and David Maher's cross-country record of 31 hours and 4 minutes, which they set in a modified BMW M5 in 2006.<br />
<br />
Bolian, a 28-year-old Atlanta native, had long dreamed of racing from East Coast to West. A decade ago, for a high school assignment, Bolian interviewed Brock Yates, who conceived the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, aka the Cannonball Run.<br />
<br />
Yates, who played the previously quoted organizer in the film he wrote himself, won the first Cannonball in the early 1970s with a time of 35 hours and 53 minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told him, 'One day I'd like to beat your record,' &quot; Bolian recalled.<br />
<br />
<b>Ounce of prevention</b><br />
<br />
It sounds like great outlaw fun -- and certainly, Hollywood added its embellishments, like the supremely confident, infidel-cursing sheik with a Rolls Royce and Sammy Davis Jr. in a priest getup -- but Bolian said it took 18 months of research and groundwork.<br />
<br />
Beginning in 2009, about the time he started working for Lamborghini Atlanta, Bolian researched cars, routes, moon phases, traffic patterns, equipment, gas mileage and modifications.<br />
<br />
He went into preparation mode about 18 months ago and chose a Mercedes CL55 AMG with 115,000 miles for the journey. The Benz's gas tank was only 23 gallons, so he added two 22-gallon tanks in the trunk, upping his range to about 800 miles. The spare tire had to go in the backseat with his spotter, Dan Huang, a student at Georgia Tech, Bolian's alma mater.<br />
<br />
To foil the police, he installed a switch to kill the rear lights and bought two laser jammers and three radar detectors. He commissioned a radar jammer, but it wasn't finished in time for the trek. There was also a police scanner, two GPS units and various chargers for smartphones and tablets -- not to mention snacks, iced coffee and a bedpan.<br />
<br />
By the time he tricked out the Benz, which included a $9,000 tuneup, &quot;it was a real space station of a thing,&quot; he said, describing the lights and screens strewn through the car's cockpit.<br />
<br />
Yet he still wasn't done.<br />
<br />
&quot;The hardest thing, quite honestly, was finding people crazy enough to do it with me,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Co-driver Dave Black, one of the Atlanta Lamborghini dealership's customers, didn't sign on until three days before they left, and &quot;support passenger&quot; Huang didn't get involved until about 18 hours before the team left Atlanta for Manhattan.<br />
<br />
If his difficulty finding a copilot wasn't an omen, Manhattan would deliver one. While scouting routes out of the city, a GPS unit told Bolian to take a right on red, in the wrong direction down a one-way road. He was quickly pulled over.<br />
<br />
Bolian got a warning -- and a healthy dose of relief that the officer didn't question the thick odor of fuel as he stood over the vents pumping fumes from the trunk.<br />
<br />
<b>Record run begins</b><br />
<br />
The trio ignored what some might have considered a harbinger and the left the Red Ball Garage on East 31st Street, the starting point for Yates' Cannonball, a few hours later. To be exact, they left October 19 at 9:55 p.m., according to a tracking company whose officials asked not be identified because they were unaware that Bolian would be driving so illegally when he hired them.<br />
<br />
They hit a patch of traffic in New York that held them up for 15 minutes but soon had an average speed of about 90 mph. In Pennsylvania, they tapped the first of many scouts, one of Bolian's acquaintances who drove the speed limit 150 to 200 miles ahead of the CL55 and warned them of any police, construction or other problems.<br />
<br />
They blew through Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, hitting St. Louis before dawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything possible went perfect,&quot; Bolian said, explaining they never got lost and rarely encountered traffic or construction delays.<br />
<br />
By the time they hit southern Missouri, near the Oklahoma border, they learned they were &quot;on track to break the existing record if they averaged the speed limit for the rest of the trip,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Yeah, right. This wasn't about doing speed limits.<br />
<br />
They kept humming west, and as they neared the Texas-New Mexico border, they calculated they might beat the 30-hour mark, a sort of Holy Grail in transcontinental racing that Bolian likened to the 4-minute mile.<br />
<br />
Never one to settle, &quot;we decided to break 29,&quot; Bolian said.<br />
<br />
The unnamed tracking company says the Benz pulled into the Portofino Hotel and Marina in Redondo Beach, California, at 11:46 p.m. on October 20 after driving 2,803 miles. The total time: 28 hours, 50 minutes and about 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of the time, we weren't going insanely fast,&quot; Bolian said, not realizing his definition of &quot;insanely&quot; is a little different from most folks'.<br />
<br />
When they were moving, which, impressively, was all but 46 minutes of the trip, they were averaging around 100 mph. Their total average was 98 mph, and their top speed was 158 mph, according to an onboard tracking device.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apart from a FedEx truck not checking his mirrors before he tried to merge on top of me, we didn't really have any issues,&quot; Bolian said.<br />
<br />
Do not try this at home<br />
<br />
He concedes his endeavor was a dangerous one, especially when you consider Bolian slept only 40 minutes of the trip, and co-driver Black slept an hour. But Bolian went out of his way to make it as safe as possible, choosing a weekend day with clear weather and a full moon -- and routes, when possible, with little traffic or construction.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had plenty of people at home praying I'd make it safely, and, more importantly, had my wife praying that I wouldn't have to do it again,&quot; he said, adding he has no children, which was also a factor. &quot;That was one of the spurs to go ahead and get this over with. That's probably the next adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Asked if the technological advances since the previous record holders made their run gave him an advantage, Bolian replied, &quot;Absolutely.&quot; Because two teams broke the 32-hour mark in 2006 and 2007, he had a detailed &quot;guide book&quot; on how to do it, where they had to rely on word-of-mouth tales from the 1980s.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank Alex for that. We're all adding chapters to the same story of American car culture,&quot; Bolian said. Alex Roy did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment.<br />
<br />
Bolian had hoped to revisit that high school interview and tell Yates he'd followed through on that promise to break his record, but Yates now suffers from Alzheimer's.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll pay him a visit just for the sake of it,&quot; Bolian said, &quot;but I can't tell him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Where the Cannonball scofflaws aimed to make a statement about personal freedom, Bolian said he has the utmost respect for law enforcement. His goal was merely to &quot;add myself and pay tribute to this chapter of automotive history,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Bolian also hopes that he shattered Roy's record by such a stark margin that it discourages would-be Cannonballers from attempting to break his record, and it's not just a matter of his own legacy, he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It really isn't something we need a whole band of lunatics doing,&quot; he said.

			<description><![CDATA[Sometime last week a friend of mine sent a two word sentence to me. "Space Dandy?" I had no idea what he was smoking so promptly ignored him. Well it turns out that the team that made Cowboy Bebop is making a new science fiction anime, and it isn't exactly what I would have expected.

<br />
Space Dandy is a comedy about a pompadoured bancho (goofy self-styled badass) who explores space with his alien space cat companion. What's really interesting is that the english dub will air on Adult Swim simultaneously (technically slightly before) the Japanese broadcast! <br />
<br />
Starts in January 2014.<br />
