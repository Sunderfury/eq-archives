 *My pet is nearly indestructible.  I rarely see his health go down much, and if it does he heals it back quickly. I am now 64 and in hellfire peninsula I soloed the kill 5 colossus quest, and got Azerious the cruel down to 5%.  I am certain I can get him with a bit more prep.  Is this power boost attributed to the patch, or has it been like this for a bit?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Now that 3.0 has been out for a while, what are your thoughts about the state of mages? I'd like to get some input from fellow raiders, but this isn't limited to just raiding- how are you all performing in 5mans and such?<br />
<br />
We did a bit of BT then moved to Sunwell because of how ridiculously quickly stuff was dying (2-3minutes per boss, generally). We got Brut down, and despite it being our first attempts on Felmyst got him to ~60% within one full rotation. Based on peoples' damage reports (so I'm not completely sold on how accurate they are, but work as a ballpark), I've been pretty consistently top four. We run with two rogues (one with basically full Illidan/early Sunwell gear), 3-4 locks, one mage, two oomkins, a retrinoob, an ele or ehn shaman (depending on who is online), and a dps warrior for our core dps set. So far, only our top rogue has been able to consistently top me on damage. On Brut I was parsing at 2.5k dps, and I know I missed more than a couple pyroblasts. I'm running a 10/51/0 spec, but keeping up living bomb versus focus magic I guess is my main question right now. Mana doesn't seem to be an issue, so is the crit from FM worth dropping LB? LB only seems to be useful on bosses really, since everything else dies WAY too fast. On the other hand, extra crits would mean extra pyroblasts...<br />
<br />
Also, I've had to shuffle some gear around for the changes to hit- because I have no points in frost, I've had to gear for 14% hit (rather than 11%). I need to grab the surefooted enchant, but I think what I have works (armory is pretty close to my actual setup, although its not completely accurate for some reason). Is there any glaring changes in my gear I should look out for (including old healing gear- its kind of annoying that the S4 pvp healing necklace is better than the dps one)? I've run the most recent Rawr, so I'm gonna work on grabbing a couple of pieces that jump out at me, but I haven't looked into exactly how much of the healing gear is included in Rawr's calculations.<br />
<br />
Finally, I must say, fire spec now is actually quite a lot of fun. For the most part it's still your standard scorch->fireball rotation, but with the scorch glyph setup is much faster. My usual rotation goes something like scorchx2->LB->fireball, toss LB whenever it fades, and if I notice it, toss a pyroblast. Much more reactive than it used to be, and not quite as mind-numbing :grinyes:. How does it compare to arc and frost specs?</div>
