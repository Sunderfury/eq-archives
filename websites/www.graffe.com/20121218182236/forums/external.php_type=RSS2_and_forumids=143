PLEASE PLEASE I'm hoping you can retrieve that message, It was a LO of Work. Call me if you need to, I don't have a computer at home, I use the libraries......816-&lt;removed&gt;.  And please respect my privacy on this, it would probably embarass him if he knows I wrote to you and I doubt he's like that.<br />

<br />
By agreeing to these rules, you warrant that you will not post any messages that are .......&quot;hateful, threatening, or otherwise violative of any laws.&quot; You agree that you will use Graffë's Forum in compliance with all applicable local, state, national law.  You (or me) or a third party licensor, as appropriate, retain all patent, trademark and copyright to any Content you submit, post or display on or through Graffë's services and you are responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate.<br />
<br />
So I suggest you rethink your refusal to withdraw your posts to and about me until you seriously study up on some laws. They were made to protect people from random acts of this sort. This is not a joke and your cooperation in not intruding in or complicating anyone's life unnecessarily is appreciated. There are enough real problems in the world that we all have to deal with.</div>
