			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Everyone has their own opinion on using last night's leftovers as next day's work lunch, a weekly salad bowl making its way into the side of the lunch box, and buying bulk and putting beverages into a thermos, but I am looking more and more into general cost-saving lunches. <br />
<br />
Right now, I've got this week's lunches broken up into 2 PB&amp;J Sandwiches, a banana, and a thermos of soda (club) and a couple bottled waters, and making my morning coffee on the machine at work. Vs buying a lunch every day @ Carl's Jr (Burgers), its over $70 a month, just 20 meals out of the month. <br />
<br />
I used to crock pot alot, and the savings there alone creates a gourmet wonder of leftovers, but I'd like to figure out some more cost saving meals that are healthy. <br />
<br />
Deli Meats are generally expensive. Buying a bird myself, and either bbqing it or smoking it, I can save more than getting it from the deli counter. I haven't done the math, because its more difficult if I haven't made it practical, already myself. <br />
<br />
What do you use in your bag lunch that is cost effective over eating out?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Are any of you using an Arduino, Rasberry Pi, or (recently shipping) Parallela boards? I have been very impressed by the amount of quality literature for the Arduino and Rasberry Pi boards targetting the layman.  I am not aware of any online courses or videos that are based on those though; there may be some however. In the long term I am hoping that the greater amount of interest in electronics by people not associated with a corporation will lead to a lower barrier to entry for working with more complex hardware, which as a side effect will make hardware based startups much less expensive to pursue as licenses for the supporting software runs into the tens of thousands of dollars at present; good enough toolchains for just software is mostly free in comparison.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I try to avoid paper to the extent possible, but when I do use some paper my favorite one to use is Ampad's Evidence Quad Dual-Pad (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ampad-Evidence-Dual-Pad-Quadrille-20-210/dp/B000JCTH2Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Ampad-Evidence.../dp/B000JCTH2Q</a>) that is quadrille rule and letter size and has a blue grid on white background.  It has a nice weight and thickness and ink does not bleed through the pages.  I always use a fine point ink pen (black) and it has great contrast with the page.  It is a much nicer engineering paper than what I had previously which I found hard to read in general and the grid was too faded.  The Ampad is a few dollars cheaper as well.<br />
<br />
I've been using a Fisher Space Pen (black ink, fine point) for my everyday pen which has a nice flow on the page that dries quickly. It is a pretty reasonably priced pen and refills while still being nicely constructed.  What I like about it is how durable it is and how few moving parts it has.  It is an excellent design.  I've used bothe the bullet and original form factor.  Both are nice, but I prefer the original a bit more.</div>

In the gray container is approximately 30lbs of Chicken marinating in my wife's BBQ marinade (family secret). <br />
<br />
the remaining 40lbs (yes, 40 lbs) of chicken was a goof on my part. I might have a bbq fund raiser for my grand-father-in-law's church in the bbq. Haven't decided. FOr some reason, I counted my portions for the chicken by half, and bought twice as much. Fucking Costco and their badd ass prices. LOL. <br />
<br />
And NO, there will be no crock-pot involved.</div>

I made that last week, and it turned out really good.  The chicken had excellent flavor, and I think I will end up making some of just the chicken for salads or a pasta dish in the future.  I skipped the vinegar and salt with that the reciple suggests though and used serrano peppers instead of jalapeno.  I think putting some steamed spinach in it would be nice too in the future.  Naturally I ate them bare handed like a savage as well.  I used Mozarella instead of Monterey Jack cheese as well, which I think matches the rest of the ingredients a lot better.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Ran out of all-purpose flour earlier in the day after I'd made my week's pita breads. <br />
<br />
I had a bunch of pastry flour left from a project from some while back, and got to wondering if it would make a good pasta noodle. <br />
<br />
In general Cake Flour is milled the smallest, and I'd seen a cooking show do pasta with cake flour as opposed to all-purpose, so I figured &quot;why the hell not pastry flour?&quot; <br />
<br />
I don't know what went wrong exactly - if I didn't knead it long enough, or roll it thin enough, or what really, but jesus. <br />
<br />
Flavor was fine, but texture was way off. it was like some sort of powdery mess when I bit into it, slimy on the outside. not enjoyable.</div>
