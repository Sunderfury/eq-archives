<br />
The Red Cross is to start collecting food for families in the UK who are struggling to feed themselves.<br />
<br />
The charity said the campaign was a first step in considering whether it should be doing more to tackle the current &quot;food poverty challenge&quot;.<br />
<br />
British Red Cross will send volunteers to supermarkets to ask shoppers to donate items to be given to food banks through the charity Fareshare.<br />
<br />
It said there was strong evidence of families in need through food poverty.<br />
<br />
Juliet Mountford, head of UK service development for the Red Cross, said: &quot;For British Red Cross it's a toe in the water.&quot;<br />
<br />
According to figures from the Trussell Trust food bank network, about 500,000 people in Britain needed support from food banks last year.<br />
<br />
The Red Cross has asked its 30,000 volunteers in Britain to join Fareshare workers at up to 2,000 Tesco stores on the last weekend of November.<br />
<br />
They will appeal to shoppers to donate tinned and packet foods, which will then be distributed to charities.<br />
<br />
Financial crisis<br />
 <br />
Fareshare was set up as a project within homelessness charity Crisis in 1994 and has worked independently on tackling food poverty and food waste since 2004.<br />
<br />
The Red Cross announced the initiative as it released a report on the humanitarian impact of Europe's financial crisis, which found a 75% increase in people relying on its food aid across the Continent over the last three years.<br />
<br />
At least 43 million people across Europe are not getting enough to eat each day and 120 million are at risk of poverty, according to the report.<br />
<br />
<b>The Red Cross has provided food to refugees and to flooding victims in Cumbria in 2009, but it has not helped with nationwide food aid since World War II.</b><br />
<br />
Oxfam's UK poverty director Chris Johnes told the Independent he was &quot;genuinely shocked&quot; that the Red Cross was getting involved in food collection.<br />
<br />
He said: &quot;They don't do things for reasons of grandstanding at all. The fact that they are doing this... is a very clear signal how serious things have become.&quot;<br />
<br />
Food waste<br />
 <br />
A report last month found that large amounts of perfectly edible food go to waste because they are thrown away at the production stage or after purchase by consumers. <br />
<br />
The study by the UK's global food security programme found that up to two fifths of a crop of fruit or vegetables can be discarded because it does not meet certain standards such as size or shape.<br />
<br />
It also suggested that the average household throws away more than 5kg (11lb) of food a week, nearly two thirds of which is avoidable.<br />
<br />
The waste costs £480 a year per household on average and £680 per family, according to the research.<br />
<br />
Conservative minister Lord Freud provoked anger in July when he questioned whether there were &quot;causal connections&quot; between the rise of food banks and government austerity policies.<br />
<br />
In September Education Secretary Michael Gove was accused of being &quot;out of touch&quot; when he appeared to suggest that families using food banks were responsible for their own predicament.<br />
<br />
Labour said the Red Cross action was a wake-up call to the government over the cost of living crisis.<br />
<br />
But a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said it was supporting vulnerable groups through measures such as the winter fuel allowance and cold weather payments.<br />
<br />
<b>The spokesman said there was no &quot;robust evidence&quot; that welfare reforms were linked to the increased use of food banks.</b>

			Sales in Parliament’s 19 restaurants, nine bars and one coffee shop fell 8pc to £7.5 million in the financial year 2010/11. It means for every £10 an MP spent on lunch, the public contributed £7.60. The year before, the public contributed £6.90.

			Diamond rain' falls on Saturn and Jupiter<br />
By James Morgan Science reporter, BBC News<br />
<br />
Diamonds big enough to be worn by Hollywood film stars could be raining down on Saturn and Jupiter, US scientists have calculated.<br />
<br />
New atmospheric data for the gas giants indicates that carbon is abundant in its dazzling crystal form, they say.<br />
<br />
Lightning storms turn methane into soot (carbon) which as it falls hardens into chunks of graphite and then diamond.<br />
<br />
These diamond &quot;hail stones&quot; eventually melt into a liquid sea in the planets' hot cores, they told a conference.<br />
<br />
The biggest diamonds would likely be about a centimetre in diameter - &quot;big enough to put on a ring, although of course they would be uncut,&quot; says Dr Kevin Baines, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.<br />
<br />
He added they would be of a size that the late film actress Elizabeth Taylor would have been &quot;proud to wear&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bottom line is that 1,000 tonnes of diamonds a year are being created on Saturn.<br />
<br />
&quot;People ask me - how can you really tell? Because there's no way you can go and observe it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It all boils down to the chemistry. And we think we're pretty certain.&quot;<br />
Thunderstorm alleys<br />
<br />
Baines presented his unpublished findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Denver, Colorado, alongside his co-author Mona Delitsky, from California Speciality Engineering.<br />
<br />
Uranus and Neptune have long been thought to harbour gemstones. But Saturn and Jupiter were not thought to have suitable atmospheres.<br />
<br />
Baines and Delitsky analysed the latest temperature and pressure predictions for the planets' interiors, as well as new data on how carbon behaves in different conditions.<br />
<br />
They concluded that stable crystals of diamond will &quot;hail down over a huge region&quot; of Saturn in particular.<br />
<br />
&quot;It all begins in the upper atmosphere, in the thunderstorm alleys, where lightning turns methane into soot,&quot; said Baines.<br />
<br />
&quot;As the soot falls, the pressure on it increases. And after about 1,000 miles it turns to graphite - the sheet-like form of carbon you find in pencils.&quot;<br />
<br />
By a depth of 6,000km, these chunks of falling graphite toughen into diamonds - strong and unreactive.<br />
<br />
These continue to fall for another 30,000km - &quot;about two-and-a-half Earth-spans&quot; says Baines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Once you get down to those extreme depths, the pressure and temperature is so hellish, there's no way the diamonds could remain solid.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's very uncertain what happens to carbon down there.&quot;<br />
<br />
One possibility is that a &quot;sea&quot; of liquid carbon could form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Diamonds aren't forever on Saturn and Jupiter. But they are on Uranus and Neptune, which are colder at their cores,&quot; says Baines.<br />
'Rough diamond'<br />
<br />
The findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but other planetary experts contacted by BBC News said the possibility of diamond rain &quot;cannot be dismissed&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;The idea that there is a depth range within the atmospheres of Jupiter and (even more so) Saturn within which carbon would be stable as diamond does seem sensible,&quot; says Prof Raymond Jeanloz, one of the team who first predicted diamonds on Uranus and Neptune.<br />
<br />
&quot;And given the large sizes of these planets, the amount of carbon (therefore diamond) that may be present is hardly negligible.&quot;<br />
<br />
However Dr Nadine Nettelmann, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said further work was needed to understand whether carbon can form diamonds in an atmosphere which is rich in hydrogen and helium - such as Saturn's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baines and Delitsky considered the data for pure carbon, instead of a carbon-hydrogen-helium mixture,&quot; she explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;We cannot exclude the proposed scenario (diamond rain on Saturn and Jupiter) but we simply have no data on mixtures in the planets. So we do not know if diamond formation occurs at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, an exoplanet that was believed to consist largely of diamond may not be so precious after all, according to new research.<br />
<br />
The so-called &quot;diamond planet&quot; 55 Cancri e orbits a star 40 light-years from our Solar System.<br />
<br />
A study in 2010 suggested it was a rocky world with a surface of graphite surrounding a thick layer of diamond, instead of water and granite like Earth.<br />
<br />
But new research to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, calls this conclusion in question, making it unlikely any space probe sent to sample the planet's innards would dig up anything sparkling.<br />
<br />
Carbon, the element diamonds are made of, now appears to be less abundant in relation to oxygen in the planet's host star - and by extension, perhaps the planet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Based on what we know at this point, 55 Cancri e is more of a 'diamond in the rough',&quot; said author Johanna Teske, of the University of Arizona.

			BRUSSELS — The only thing more enticing to a pirate than treasure, according to Belgian authorities, is the chance to see himself in a movie. <br />
<br />
A man suspected of being a pirate mastermind arrived in Brussels on Saturday expecting to sign a deal for a movie about his swashbuckling past in the Somali piracy business. Instead, he found himself under arrest, charged with kidnapping, organized crime and, of course, piracy. <br />
<br />
Johan Delmulle, a Belgian federal prosecutor, said Monday that Mohamed Abdi Hassan, a pirate leader also known as Afweyne, had been arrested as he left a flight at the Brussels airport. Mohamed Aden, described as his accomplice, was also arrested. <br />
<br />
Mr. Hassan “is considered by the international community, notably the United Nations, one of the most important pirate leaders, responsible for a dozen attacks,” Mr. Delmulle said. United Nations investigators called Mr. Hassan a “notorious and influential” pirate leader. Mr. Aden, who faced the same charges, was accused of having supported what is suspected to be Mr. Hassan’s piracy operation. <br />
<br />
In 2009, a dozen pirates attacked a Belgian ship, called the Pompei, about 700 miles off the coast of Somalia. They held the crew, including two Belgian officers and a Dutch captain, in what Mr. Delmulle described as “inhumane conditions, leaving their families in total uncertainty about their fate.” <br />
<br />
The ship and its crew were released after more than 70 days. The Belgian state security service, military intelligence and the federal judicial police of Brussels searched for the men they believed were responsible, leading to the prosecution and sentencing of two pirates, he said. One was sentenced to 10 years by a Brussels court in 2011; the other, nine years by a court in Bruges in 2012. <br />
<br />
The Belgian authorities, Mr. Delmulle said, “never hid their firm intention to not limit the investigation and prosecution to just those who executed this crime, but also to those behind it — the people who ordered, directed and financed and helped with logistic support.” <br />
<br />
Mr. Hassan, whose nickname means “big mouth,” was believed to have helped finance the attack. But as long as he stayed in Somalia, in what Mr. Delmulle called its “complicated judicial situation,” he was beyond the reach of Belgian law enforcement and the international warrant for his arrest. So the authorities began a sting operation lasting months to lure Mr. Hassan to Belgium. <br />
<br />
A magistrate authorized special units of the Belgian federal police to “work out an infiltration operation, the aim of which was to detain Afweyne.” The agents worked through Mr. Aden. They said they wanted Mr. Hassan “to collaborate as adviser and expert in the matter on a film about maritime piracy,” Mr. Delmulle said. “This film was to reflect his life as a pirate.” <br />
<br />
After the police courted Mr. Hassan for months to work on the supposed film project, he and Mr. Aden agreed to travel to Belgium. Around 8 a.m. on Saturday, the morning after the new Tom Hanks film about Somali piracy, “Captain Phillips,” opened in theaters in the United States, the two men stepped off a flight from Nairobi and into the hands of the police. <br />
<br />
The men were expected to appear in court in Bruges on Tuesday. “Too often,” Mr. Delmulle said, “these people are beyond reach.”

			A Malaysian appeals court ruled on Monday that only Muslims can use the word “Allah” to refer to god, upholding a government ban on the word being used in a Catholic publication. <br />
<br />
The ruling reverses an earlier lower court decision. <br />
<br />
“Our common finding that the use of Allah is not an integral part of the Christian faith, so we find no justification for why they insist on using the name or word in their publication,” said Justice Mohamed Apandi who read a summary of the more than 100-page ruling. <br />
<br />
He said the three-member appellate court panel also noted that allowing non-Muslims to use the word would cause confusion and could jeopardise public safety. <br />
<br />
“The welfare of an individual or group, must yield to the interest of society at large,” he said. <br />
<br />
Annou Xavier, one of the lawyers for the Catholic Church, said he would discuss with his client whether they would appeal in the Federal Court. <br />
<br />
The controversy started in 2008 when the government prohibited Catholic publication The Herald from using the word “Allah”, and the church filed a court case questioning the order. <br />
<br />
On December 31, 2009, the Kuala Lumpur High Court lifted the prohibition, noting that the church had a constitutional right to use the word in its publication on the ground that religions other than Islam can be practiced in peace and harmony. <br />
<br />
The High Court decision triggered protests from Muslim groups.

Whatever the case may be, they both interest me, but it seems like the only thing in the area for me, here, might be airsoft. <br />
<br />
How much of a money sink is necessary to just begin the hobby? I don't want to jump right into gettng grenade launchers - but instead, just the most basic safety gear, and a decent pistol and perhaps a decent semi automatic rifle, and thats it - nothing on the deluxe/premium line - just something slightly accurate that isn't 100% durable, that I can just keep my hands on.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>IT People!<br />
<br />
I am considering picking up some more IT skills. Suppose, hypothetically, that there is this guy named Istari.  He speaks Chinese and knows a thing or two about business in China.  One of the things that Istari occasionally gets asked to do is help determine whether Chinese subsidiaries of US-Owned corporations business operations are in compliance with SEC/DOJ requirements. I have had many wonderful adventures in China, from being kidnapped, interrogated by the communist party, poisoned repeatedly (great food, though), and there was that one time a toilet collapsed on top of me. But that's beside the point. So suppose someone knows about Chinese business practices and language, and also knows about what requirements apply to those businesses if you have a USA affiliate (i.e. a parent company or a subsidiary, must comply with various requirements for fair business competition practices)<br />
<br />
So here's the question for IT Folks. There is a whole lot of electronically stored information these days being kept by companies, especially in China, where the country is basically dominated by introverted internet nerds.  The international trade compliance people can't really keep up with it, since that would basically involve looking at millions of pages of highly vaguely worded stuff, and the local Chinese dudes are pretty clubby anyway.   So usually the only time this gets looked into is during an internal investigation, which is exorbitantly expensive to conduct. This would involve lots of predictive analytics of natural language documents.<br />
<br />
That's changing with Big Data and such, and this is an evolving area that I'm interested in looking into.  Basically, with predictive analytics, a person familiar with the Chinese linguistic set and the United States trade requirements would be able to teach a computer how to read, say, 10,000,000 pages of electronic information and spit out a concise data set pointing at foreign business practices inconsistent with the parent company's corporate policies. I could then look at the set, and prepare to kick some butt. What I need to figure out is: how can I learn this snazz? I know there's going to be several years before this sort of technology takes off in this particular sector. It looks to me like this would be some sort of computer science/info systems, or digital forensics / predictive forensics type learning. I figure we have several years before this really takes off; it's only in 2013 that there's been talk of startups experimenting with this sort of thing.<br />
<br />
I was looking around at some master's programs to pick up a credential, but also take some time to teach myself. I've looked at a few programs, like M.S. in any of: computer science (machine learning), computer information systems, and business analytics. I'd probably do these part-time over several years while working. The business analytics programs seemed relevant, since I'm not looking to be an engineer so much as do information analysis.<br />
<br />
In short, what tech skills would I need to do this trick of combining my business/linguistic knowledge into analytics effectively?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Just got home from his concert with his bluegrass band (Steep Canyon Rangers), and it was FANTASTIC!!! 3 hours of non-stop awesome. Really, 3 hours. I've never seen a set of musicians play that long without a stop. They did rotations within instrumentation, so I'm sure that helped out alot, but that mandolin player hardly caught a break anywhere in there at all, and for all their singing, I didn't see one of them drink a drop. <br />
<br />
An added bonus is that this was the recorded version that will air on PBS in March (or maybe given out as part of their donation campaigns as a reward/gift). <br />
<br />
If you can get tickets to its stop on their tour, I highly recommend it. It was fantastic, and Steve Martin's schtick REALLY blended well.</div>

			The Eton Scholarship Question: this is how the British elite are trained to think <br />
<br />
 <br />
As one of the school&#8217;s scholarship exam questions shows, young boys are encouraged to think that humanity, compassion, even sense are secondary to winning. This is how we&#8217;ve ended up with politicians who will enact any policy, no matter the human cost, just so their party will win.<br />
By Laurie Penny Published 24 May 2013 15:52<br />
<br />
<br />
How will you defend the murder of civilians when you&#8217;re Prime Minister? Pupils competing for a scholarship to Eton have been asked just that, in the following question from a 2011 exam which seemed to draw its inspiration from recent events in London:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=2707&amp;d=1381497824"  title="Name:  o-ETON-COLLEGE-EXAM-570.jpg
Views: 93

<br />
The headmaster of Eton, responding to the furore on Twitter, claimed that this was an intellectual exercise, based on Machiavelli&#8217;s The Prince, and was taken out of context. It was nothing of the kind. In fact, questions like this - topics for debate designed to reward pupils for defending the morally indefensible in the name of maintaining &quot;order&quot; - crop up throughout the British elite education system, from prep schools to public schools like Eton to public speaking competitions right up to debating societies like the Oxford and Cambridge Unions, which are modelled on parliament for a reason. <br />
<br />
This is how you&#8217;re meant to argue when you&#8217;re eventually in charge. You&#8217;re trained for it, and part of that training is regularly being presented with morally indefensible positions to defend anyway or risk losing whatever competition you&#8217;re engaged with. I have seen perfectly decent young men get carried away defending genocide and torture because that&#8217;s the only way to win. Those who are unable to do so are taught that they have no business having political opinions. The people assumed to be the future elite are not rewarded for getting the answer which is most correct, most compassionate or humane or even sensible - they&#8217;re rewarded for smashing the opposition. And that&#8217;s how you get politicians who will argue anything they&#8217;re told to, enact any policy they're told to no matter how many how many people will get hurt, just so that their team can win.<br />
<br />
Moreover, this isn&#8217;t just a standard homework question. It appears on a scholarship entrance exam, a test designed to be sat by young men seeking to join the ranks of the rich and powerful by virtue of merit and smarts rather than family money. Most fee-paying schools have such a system in place, especially the really elite ones which need to maintain a veneer of public conscience to bolster their tax-exempt charity status (yes, Eton is technically a charity) and boost exam results by scattering some middle-class nerds amongst the rich twits. I sat an entrance exam just like this thirteen years ago, because my parents wanted me to have a private education and they couldn&#8217;t afford the fees. Of the hundreds of exams I&#8217;ve sat since, none has had quite such a material effect on my future. <br />
<br />
Had a question like this appeared on that test, I know I&#8217;d have been torn. I wouldn&#8217;t be torn now, of course, I&#8217;d write &#8216;go fuck yourself&#8217; across the paper in my sparkliest pens, but right now I&#8217;m an adult with a job, not a scared thirteen-year-old who wants to make her mum proud. The obvious answer- that any Prime Minister who attempts to justify the murder of protesters after the rule of law has disintegrated is not fit to rule and should step down immediately - is not one that appears on the test. And that&#8217;s the point of tests like these.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s not enough to be clever. What this test says is: if you want to be part of the ruling elite, you have to share our values, and one of those values is maintaining power at any cost, even if it involves defending the indefensible. Having a moral compass that doesn't spin wildly at the promise of power is an active impediment. The significant line in that extended question is &#8216;You are the Prime Minister.&#8217; As if you&#8217;d be anything else. <br />
<br />
Eton trains rich young men for power. The all-boys school has produced nineteen Prime Ministers, including the current one. The Mayor of London and a significant chunk of the cabinet also attended the school. Nearly all of our most powerful politicians, in short, went to Eton, and were trained in its values. Values that include responding to a question about shooting protesters dead with clever rhetoric rather than a long, hard look at your own conscience, as well as reading Machiavelli as an instruction manual rather than a satire. Whoever set this exam question, one that obliges thirteen-year-old boys to defend the murder of protesters as Prime Minister, knew of the likelihood that one of those boys might well actually be Prime Minister one day, and be in the position to order protesters killed for real. How many marks do you get for that?<br />
<br />
In most elite clubs and societies, there are questions you&#8217;re not allowed to ask. For a certain breed of flush-cheeked young British aristocrats, this is the question that will never, ever appear on an exam paper:<br />
<br />
Is there any particular reason why we should be in charge?<br />
<br />

</div>and we wonder why our nation is being run by elite lunatics selling off the crown jewels to their city friends and driving the nation to utter collapse?<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Have we ever had one of these threads?  Where we tell those stories about the things your kid (or someone else's) said or did that was completely inappropriate?  Mine did one tonight, and it made me think of a few others as well.  Puts a smile on my face, those dirty, inappropriate, little bastages :grinyes:<br />
<br />
So tonight, I took my 5 year old son out for supper after work - his choice.  Of course it's pizza.  So we're in the pizza parlor, and the Thursday night football game is on.  The place is packed.  He says loudly (because everything is said loudly nowadays - it's his thing I guess)<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, football is like a big game of monkey in the middle.  And...if you keep the ball away from the bad guys long enough, you get to do a funny dance for the TV.  Like this!&quot;<br />
<br />
And then, before I realize what he's doing - he Flash Gordons to the center of the pizza parlor and starts doing the pelvic thrust like no 5 year old should know how to do.  Place erupts into stitches - there's an old grandma in the corner who laughs her dentures right out, and of course, by now he LOVES the attention so me trying to get him to stop just isn't going to happen...  Oh well, at least it was funny at the moment (as opposed to the normal ones where it most certainly is NOT funny at the moment, and you want to crawl into a hole and hide)<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As a kid, I took vitamin C whenever my mother handed me one, and I occasionally ate my Flinstone's vitamins if I remembered to ask my mother for one. Every morning I'd watch my father get up at the butt crack of dawn, and take a Centrum Silver, and a glass of metamucil, and then head out to the gym. <br />
<br />
Since I've become an adult, whenever I feel a cold coming on, I take a couple doses of Airborne, or Emergen-C; whichever seems to be available wherever I stop to get it. <br />
<br />
But I've never truly been very regular about taking multi-vitamins, myself. Just sort of as an imaginary preventative measure against getting sick. <br />
<br />
My google-fu has resulted in very little to support the use of multi-viatmins without trying to sell me some in addition to the ones they review. Most articles seem to state that there are few physicians who have seen any data to conclude that multi-vitamins will help prevent heart disease, or anything else someone would prefer not to suffer in their mid to late life. <br />
<br />
So, naturally, I decided to start taking multi-vitamins. A week in, and I've got that tickle of a cold coming on, in the back of my throat. Teh fek.</div>
