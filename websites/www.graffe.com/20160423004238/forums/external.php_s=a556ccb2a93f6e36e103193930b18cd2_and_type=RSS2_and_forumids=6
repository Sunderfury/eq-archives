			More than a decade after six unarmed civilians were shot by police while trying to cross New Orleans’ Danziger Bridge in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, five former officers pleaded guilty in connection with the deadly shooting, NOLA.com reports.<br />
<br />
In 2011, the officers were convicted of more serious crimes, but a new trial was ordered after a federal judge determined prosecutors had engaged in “grotesque” ethical misconduct. On Wednesday, all five officers pleaded guilty over the 2005 shooting and subsequent coverup in exchange for reduced sentences ranging from three to 12 years. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/20/us/new-orleans-danziger-bridge-plea-deal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">From CNN</a>:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			On Sunday, September 4, 2005, initial police accounts said officers responded to reports of gunshots on the bridge and that a running gunbattle ensued with six suspects. Two people, a disabled man and teenager, were killed and four were seriously wounded in what officers involved claimed was self-defense.<br />
<br />
A witness, however, told CNN in 2006 that police lined up “like at a firing range” and fatally shot an unarmed man in the back as he fled from them. Others on the bridge said police ambushed them. In all, two people were killed and four wounded.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>“While an imperfect resolution, today’s proceeding ensures that these defendants are held accountable for their criminal actions,” said U.S. Attorney Kenneth Polite in a statement. “Those of us who continue to serve as prosecutors must embrace the lessons learned from this Danziger case.”<br />
<br />
Despite the lighter sentences, at least one surviving family member found a degree of closure.<br />
<br />
“I finally got what I wanted,” Sherrell Johnson, whose teenage son was one of the victims, told reporters. “Someone confessed.”

If you've used Slack, it's that with voice chat. If you haven't used Slack, it's like a browser based IRC Chat that has separate channels, images load inline, links get formatted nicely, etc. If you install the App, you can use it for system wide voice chat like with Mumble or Ventrilo, you can see what games someone is playing, etc. Chat that occurs while you're gone shows up in the buffer, so if you only check intermittently, you can still communicate. You can join different &quot;servers&quot; for different communities and have friends across them.<br />
<br />
Personal thoughts<br />
I kind of dislike Discord as an IRC replacement, but I know what I'm doing with IRC and have set up all of the features someone would want from Discord already. I realize that isn't a great idea for almost anyone else though.<br />
<br />
I know we have a Steam Group and a Facebook Group etc, and people rarely if ever use them. I'm kind of thinking if people used Discord, instead of seeing a name in a list and not wanting to bother them, we can have LFG channels or whatever so people can post in. But I don't want to make another random thing that no one ever uses.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>For a guy who makes his money off of technology I'm way, way behind the times when it comes to content delivery.  One thing I do know though is that I'm tired of getting whupped by my cable provider every month for the content they provide.  There has GOT to be a better, cheaper way, right?<br />
<br />
Well here's the issue.  4 year old kid, 14 year old kid in a million activities, full time job, full time business, full time parent care, full schedule.  I don't have the time or fundamental expertise to get started on cutting the cord so we can get off of cable.  Can you help????<br />
<br />
First, some background.  Right now we have literally every premium channel.  I do not WANT every premium channel.  Happy wife happy life and everything but it's too damn expensive.  Right now she's the main impediment to the process - she does not want to live without access to her shows.  Her suggestion is to just move from cable to DirectTeeVee, but that'll probably have us in the same boat.  Here are the channels that get the most eyeballs in my house:<br />
<br />
ABC / NBC / CBS for daytime teevee<br />
BET<br />
UPN whatever that is<br />
USA<br />
OWN<br />
LMN<br />
Skinemax<br />
Lifetime<br />
Boomerang<br />
Cartoon Network<br />
Nick Jr.<br />
ESPN during college football season, same with Big 10 Network and FoxSports networks<br />
Occasional HBO and Showtime but mainly for boxing<br />
Occasional Starz for the Marvel stuff<br />
TVLand occasionally<br />
<br />
Shows that are not up for negotiation:<br />
Young &amp; Restless<br />
General Hospital<br />
Divorce Court<br />
Paternity Court<br />
Whatever Other Stupid Court<br />
All that Shonda Rhimes stuff on ABC<br />
Emergency! or Chicago Fire or whatever they're calling it now<br />
Haves and Have Nots on Oprah's channel I think<br />
Whatever award show of the week BET is putting on<br />
Probably some other dreck I can't remember right now<br />
<br />
We have a fancy DVR from Cox that snags the wife's shows so she can power-watch them whenever she wants.  I have no subscriptions to anything other than Pandora and Amazon Prime.  No, not even Netflix. I am stuck in the 90s, I know.  I do have a Smart Teevee with a bunch of apps on it that I don't use, but I have zero problem going out and getting hardware and subscriptions instead. All four of us have iPads but we're not married to Apple devices.  I guess.  We have a high-def antennae but we rarely need it because hey, cable box.  Oh yah and we bundle cable, phone, and internet; it's roughly $250-$300 per month.  It's roughly a car payment per month O_O<br />
<br />
So how do I take that mess up above and turn it into something that's going to run me less than $150 before taxes every month?  Where do I even fricking start?  I've got this feeling I'm throwing $$$$$ out of an open window every time I pay the bill.</div>

			LONDON-- Boaty McBoatface has topped an online poll to name the U.K.'s newest polar research vessel, beating entries that honored scientists and explorers.<br />
<br />
Britain's Natural Environment Research Council had asked for help finding a name that would reflect the $284 million ship's mission and celebrate British naval history.<br />
<br />
The 128-yard-long, 15,000-ton ship is described by the NERC as a &quot;new polar research vessel which will deliver world-leading capability for UK research in both Antarctica and the Arctic.&quot;<br />
<br />
The council asked for inspirational entries about environmental and polar science. But in the contest that ended Saturday, Boaty McBoatface won with more than 120,000 votes -- more than three times its closest contender.<br />
<br />
The vote was advisory and the name will be decided by the council.<br />
<br />
Former BBC radio host James Hand, who proposed the winning entry, has apologized for the controversy, though he still thinks it's a &quot;brilliant name.&quot;<br />
<br />
In an interview with the BBC, Hand said he's had nothing to do with the name's success, saying it has &quot;legs of its own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've apologized profusely to the people behind the website,&quot; Hand is quoted as saying.<br />
<br />
However, a short time after the story appeared online, Hand took to Twitter to qualify his apology.<br />
<br />
He voted to name the ship after naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough.<br />
<br />
Other popular name suggestions for the boat included &quot;RSS Usain Boat,&quot; RRS Ice Ice Baby,&quot; &quot;RRS Notthetitanic,&quot; and &quot;RRS Boatimus Prime.&quot;

			WASHINGTON, April 16 (UPI) -- Saudi Arabia has warned the United States not to revoke its sovereign immunity, protecting the kingdom from lawsuits related to Sept. 11, or it will sell off hundreds of billions in American assets.<br />
<br />
A bipartisan law sponsored by Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, is being considered in the Senate, that would strip the Saudi government of its protection from American lawsuits in federal court. If enacted, the legislation would open a floodgate of civil suits against the Saudi government from families of the Sept. 11 victims.<br />
 <br />
A recent lawsuit filed in federal district court in New York by Sept. 11 families was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds.<br />
<br />
Saudi Arabia has never been formally linked to the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, but 15 of the 19 hijackers were from there. A 28-page section of the government's official report on the Sept. 11 attacks deals with the role foreign governments played in the plot, but that section remains classified and has not been released to the public.<br />
<br />
Recently, Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, alleged as part of a plea deal for his role in the attack, that some members of the large and diverse Saudi royal family were aware of the plot and supported it.<br />
<br />
Saudi Arabia has long denied any knowledge of the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Their government has called on the United States to release the redacted portion of the 9/11 Commission report so it can defend itself against any specific allegations included.<br />
<br />
The Obama administration has lobbied Congress to kill the immunity legislation, arguing the threat to the U.S. economy if Saudi Arabia were to follow through on the threats would be enormous. The New York Times reports such a sell-off would be difficult for the Saudis to pull off and could negatively impact their own economy just as much as America's.<br />
<br />
Secretary of State John Kerry also warned lawmakers revoking sovereign immunity, which America enjoys around the world, could have grave diplomatic consequences by putting Americans at risk while they're overseas.<br />
<br />
President Barack Obama is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a visit planned before the sovereign immunity debate became public. Obama has not said explicitly he would veto the legislation if it passes, but rather said he would prefer Congress to drop the issue of its own accord.

			Three Canadian families are suing a sperm bank and its distributor, alleging they were given sperm from a convicted felon diagnosed with multiple mental disorders - but told he was a genius.<br />
<br />
At least 36 women in Britain, Canada and the US are believed to have been inseminated with the donor’s sperm over the past decade, resulting in pregnancies.<br />
<br />
“It’s horrifying,” lawyer James Fireman told AFP on Friday. “These couples were seeking assistance to build a family and were very vulnerable, they put their faith in the (cryobank) industry, and this happens.”<br />
<br />
In a claim filed this week, the families allege Xytex Corp, based in the US state of Georgia and Ontario’s Outreach Health Services, misled them.<br />
<br />
The plaintiffs are seeking 15 million Canadian dollars ($11.7 million) in damages. None of the allegations have been proven in court.<br />
<br />
They allege the companies fabricated the donor’s IQ, and said the man was extremely healthy and working towards a PhD in neuroscience engineering.<br />
<br />
The families - who each had one child using the man’s sperm - learned his true identity only when Xytex inadvertently included his contact information in an email to them.<br />
<br />
A quick Internet search and a subsequent investigation revealed the donor was actually a 39-year-old Georgia man who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, narcissistic personality disorder, drug-induced psychotic disorder and significant grandiose delusions.<br />
<br />
He had been jailed for burglary and other crimes and dropped out of university 20 years ago, although he eventually returned and last year graduated with a bachelor’s degree.<br />
<br />
According to the claim, the companies continued to sell his sperm even after being informed of the discrepancies in 2014.

			Climate-change denier and Trump surrogate Sarah Palin, promoting her new film, Climate Hustle, inexplicably challenged just how much of a Science Guy Bill Nye really is: “Bill Nye is as much a scientist as I am,” she said during a Congressional event Thursday. “He’s a kids’ show actor. He’s not a scientist.”<br />
<br />
Palin lumped Nye in with those she perceives as spreading untruths about the environment: “There is a predetermined agenda definitely of those who I think are controlling the narrative right now on changes in the weather.”<br />
<br />
“There is definitely a political agenda behind all of this and as you suggested people who are involved in this issue they are not stupid. They have studied this stuff. They have studied the data that they are erroneously delivering to the public to make us think that we can somehow change the weather and how they do that is to grow government and allow the government to have more control over us, our homes, our businesses, our families, our lives, and it’s quite unfortunate because these people must be purposely doing this, right? Because they are smart enough to know better,” the former vice-presidential candidate said.<br />
<br />
Whatever. Neither Sarah Palin nor Bill Nye are scientists, but Bill Nye—a mechanical engineer who does not call himself a scientist, but the “Science Guy”—is certainly more of a scientist than Sarah Palin. He is also better at what he does than she is at what she does.<br />
<br />
Nye has been a visiting professor at Cornell, and is an executive at the Planetary Society. Palin, meanwhile, said on Thursday, “We need to keep in mind how important it is for parents to understand this issue and to understand the political agenda behind global warming. It is being used as a fundraiser, it is being used as a partisan issue unfortunately so that parents can be first and foremost in their child’s life and influence them to trust science and believe in science and not leave it to the teachers.”
