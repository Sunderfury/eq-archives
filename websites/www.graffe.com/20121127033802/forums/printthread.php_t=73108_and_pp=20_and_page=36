</div>I never noticed phasing, aside from one part right near the end. But the quest flow could be the reason for that - you never really get sent back to someplace you've already been, save for quick trips to the central temple. You really should fire it up and try it - you don't need MoP to play a panda (just to play a monk).</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I started Tuesday the same as I have been every morning for the last month or so.  Sleepless and with a stomach ache.  Since I didn't feel like staying up for the MOP launch (and did no prep) and wasn't expecting the delivery of my box for hours, I simply logged on and started doing pet battles.  (Okay, okay, I admit, I did a half dozen dailies before stopping myself.)<br />
<br />
Pet battles are surprisingly fun, though the collecting can be a little tedious.<br />
Starting with a stable of 119 pets, I took Grunty, Disgusting Oozeling, and Sprite Darter Hatchling for my primary team.<br />
Getting each to level 2 in Stormwind (and catching a few for achievement purposes/pet count) I flew through Elwynn and Westfall and picked up every &quot;new&quot; pet I could find.<br />
<br />
It wasn't until I hit level 5 or 6 that I realized I should be getting quests.  A little research told me that you actually need MOP for the Tamer quests.  (Bummer.)<br />
So I ended up hitting the 8 capitol cities (died twice in Undercity and Silvermoon, boo) and the up-to-teens zones.  Racked up a few of the achievements, added an additional 50-or-so pets (including a few rares I bought on the AH, like the Phoenix Hatchling for just 250g).<br />
<br />
I can see this'll be a &quot;during dungeon queue&quot; kind of thing eventually, but I enjoyed spending a few hours solely on it (as I did Archaeology back at the beginning of Cata).<br />
<br />
Once I got my box around 1:30pm, I logged off and then back on, all keyed up.  Took the first train to Pandaville.  Found a ghost iron node, mined it, thinking, &quot;shit why no skillup?&quot; and realized I hadn't trained.  So popped back to SW, trained, and back.<br />
<br />
Impressions:<br />
Super pretty environment<br />
The music is fantastic<br />
Mob spawning is a little nuts in a few places due to the dynamic spawning, but doable<br />
Conversely the super-spawning of resource nodes is quite nice, I got to 592 mining without trying too hard.<br />
The story is a little &quot;eh&quot; so far, but it's workable.<br />
<br />
Without paying attention to breadcrumbs and solely through exploration, I ended up finding one of those gray 95g hidden treasures (worth almost 96K exp), finished 2 additional storylines, discovered about 3/4 of the map of Jade Forest, killed a race champion (Krax'ik), made 5 Archy combines (where do those completed artifacts get turned in?) and eventually started the Pearlfin quests to hit 86.<br />
<br />
Some of the quest rewards seem a little odd; there were a couple that seemed to be exactly the same.  Are quest rewards class-generated now?  I can't imagine a paladin would want solely cloth gear from quests (as that was all that was offered to me.)<br />
<br />
Ran the Brewery once; fun fun zone.  Last boss was a little annoying til we got into our groove (we let it heal accidentally almost 25% but recovered with no deaths!)<br />
Queued for and got into the Temple however the second boss bugged out.  We forced a wipe, and couldn't release!  So I logged to char select, and was able to get back in, but no one else could.  Doh.<br />
<br />
It was a fun 14 hours.<br />
<br />
By the time I decided to log off (due to my ass hurting, even with regular stretching) I'd seen RF90 druid, warrior, mage, shaman, warlock, paladin, priest and one more that I'm drawing a blank on.</blockquote>

</div>There's so many nodes around (Herbalist) that, even if phasing DID change things, there's still going to be plenty of things to gather. And if you can't gather it, grow it! (I made it to The Tillers this evening before the 15 min reset.)<br />
<br />
The pet sale is up to 40,000 gold generated. The thing that has me most excited is all the crap pets seem to be selling. I had a sales strategy with the &quot;this pet is sold on a vendor in a capital city on our side&quot; pets: price them at 30% below vendor price, which is full guild plus reputation discount, to get the resellers to buy me out of these sub-1 g things. The pet I should have priced higher: Sprite Darter Hatchling (only 750 g each), followed by the Crocs in the City crocs (500 to 750 g each). The Strand Crawlers have been nice sellers, too. Keep selling, I don't want to have to re-list a ton of crap!</blockquote>

</div>Except this is how it worked in-game: one quest would give you (say you're a shaman) AGI mail for a given slot, another would give you INT DPS mail for that slot, and a third would give you INT healing mail for that slot. So you'd get two things to disenchant, and one thing you'd keep. Now, a third of the quests reward you with items. Look at Jade Forest. Each faction gets access to almost 200 quests in the zone (discounting daily quests), and gets a little over 30 item reward quests. Compare with Uldum (Cataclysm zone with no faction-specific quests), which has around 120 quests and close to 40 of them giving out items. You're getting less stuff, which bites for Enchanters. <br />
<br />
I've already decided to send all BoE greens to be disenchanted, whether I have an alt that would be upgraded by them or not, because there's going to be a severe lack of initial items to disenchant. This extends to other professions: my tailor is somewhere between 555 and 560 skill and has yet to make a single piece of armour. I can't justify making armour that isn't an upgrade for any alt when I can make the green quality spellthreads and use them, and you learn the spellthread recipes early enough that you don't make useless armour just to skill up. Same thing happens with leatherworking. The only silver lining in all this is there's no new bags which devour dust like there were in Cataclysm, so at least I don't have that as a mats sink.</blockquote>

</div>But if you're not an enchanter, it doesn't matter either way.  It just doesn't seem to properly itemize the options.  This was the point of my complaint, actually.<br />
<br />
I should have written down the quest names - there were two - one offered two differently named hats, both cloth, both with exactly duplicate stats and looks.  <br />
The other was a bracer or belt (I don't recall) and they were quite similar - one was a crit/haste, the other was crit/mastery.  That was a better option, but still, I would expect a little more variety with the generation.<br />
<br />
I do recognize and understand your concern about it, too, and know that I'll run into the same issue with my own enchanter.<br />

</div>I've seen items that were very similar, but not identical (like having haste/crit versus mastery/crit). The one itemization thing I've seen that pissed me off to no end? I finally ran into a silver elite that I could not solo - a jinyu in the sha-corrupted jinyu village that did an &quot;if this touches you, you die&quot; AE and a single target &quot;you're losing 50-80% of your life&quot; spell - while I was doing some quests in the area. So, fine, I call out in General for help, get two people, and take him down in a tough fight. He drops an ilvl 430 cloth bracer, I'm the only cloth person there, woo-hoo!<br />
<br />
...and then I complete the quest chain in the area and get an ilvl 434 cloth bracer as the reward.<br />

</div>D doesn't have Enchanting. D has killed five race champions so far, four solo, one in a group as above where I got the loot. The only usable item I've obtained was that cloth bracer.

		<blockquote class="restore">So my panda joined a guild last night.  Hehe, I was polite and waited my turn for someone to kill the gnoll boss in Loch Modan, and helped the monk in front of me a bit.  She asks if I would like to join her guild, and I figure, why not expecting it to be 4 people and their 40 alts, all around level 16 and it turns out to be a Level 25 guild with a few groups doing MoP online already :)  It's called Seekers of Truth, so I'll see about getting Teoretica in some red leathers though only Pombo is in it right now.  Guild perks are freaking awesome and I'd been missing them all this time.  My inviter suggested I use the guild Armorer?  Do you think she meant just the website that tracks members or is there something that repairs gear or something?  I also hadn't really looked too closely before saying I had 390 Inscription and said to let me know if anyone needed glyphs made.  Turns out there are a number of them with 5 maxed tradeskills.</blockquote>

In terms of enjoyment and lore? You missed nothing.<br />
<br />
So I tried that trinket out. It's going back in the bank, never to return. I thought it would be great for killing silver elites, but as it turns out most silver elites where I was last night have abilities that insta-kill people who don't move. And the trinket pet doesn't move. Even 700 K health doesn't save it, not even with my Smite heals. On the plus side, I finally started seeing good stuff from the silver elites. Four different BoE epic pants dropped for me last night, and I'm now one race of elite shy of the big achievement. I actually saw that race pop up, but it was a level 91 as I was checking out where the wall went and I don't think attempting an orange elite is a good idea.<br />
<br />
Bought my yak. So long, 107,000 g. At least the pets paid for part of that. I was spammed for two hours last night with &quot;Suchandsuch didn't sell&quot; messages. Re-listed 587 pets, so over 100 sold in the first 48 hours. I still make up over half of my server's battle pet auctions, heh.</blockquote>

I should have bought every single blue pet/battle pet in AD's Alliance AH for flipping, because where I saw a dozen Voodoo figurines for 200-300 gold now they're going for 10k.<br />
Sure, I lucked out and got a Disgusting Oozeling for 18g (goes for 18k) and a Phoenix Hatchling for 250 (goes for 2500-5k, but I ended up using it) but still, I think of the short list of items that had been listed and sigh.<br />

Edit: And the brewfest dailies reward 178k xp at level 88. Tempting, but... I've done them too many damn times.<br />
There is a new one, though, near the Ironforge flightmaster - inside one of the buildings. &quot;Cask you a favor&quot;. It was ok fun :)<br />
<br />
Had a guild run in Temple of the jade serpent, where 3 people forgot to run in to the last boss when the doors closed.<br />
<br />
After they + the DPS that ran in with me died, I soloed the boss. Fight length was almost 10 minutes, but it was so worth it. Really loving the new protection warrior.<br />
<br />
Hrm. I might just solo the entire jade temple for fun :)</blockquote>

</div>I've seen a vendor elsewhere which sells low 390ish gear. I think he's in zone #4, the one up the staircase? I'm not sure a low level alt could get there - the first trip there involves a raft ride quest past level 90 mobs in a tunnel - but it does exist.<br />

</div>Want some pets that you can sell FAST for more money than you'll pay for them? As in, I sold out of seven of them within the first 24 hours?<br />
<br />
Nether Ray Fry (Skyguard exalted), Pengu (Kalu'ak exalted), Tiny Sporebat (Sporeggar exalted). All of them can be purchased in infinite quantities (although the Sporebat requires Glowcaps), the battle pet versions don't have the rep requirement, and people without the rep would rather pay a few hundred to you to have them than grind out the rep.<br />
<br />
As for stuff like Voodoo Figurines - I've priced stuff like that high. You can't get a second one on a given account, so far as I know, so they are rare enough that they should be priced high.<br />
