<br />
This morning we announced that Paragon Studios will be taking to the skies of City of Heroes for the last time.<br />
<br />
In a realignment of company focus and publishing support, NCsoft has made the decision to close Paragon Studios. Effective immediately, all development on City of Heroes will cease and we will begin preparations to sunset the world's first, and best, Super Hero MMORPG before the end of the year. As part of this, all recurring subscription billing and Paragon Market purchasing will be discontinued effective immediately. We will have more information regarding a detailed timeline for the cessation of services and what you can expect in game in the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
The team here at Paragon deserves special praise for all that we have accomplished over the last 5+ years. These developers are some of the most creative and talented people in the gaming industry. By now, we've all been given this news internally, but to anyone who may be reading this message after the fact; know that your hard work and dedication has not gone unappreciated or unnoticed. To any potential studios looking to grow your team; hire these people. You won't regret it.<br />
<br />
<br />
To our Community,<br />
<br />
Thank you. Thank you for your years of support. You've been with us every step of the way, sharing in our challenges, encouraging us to make City of Heroes better, more than everyone else thought it could be. We couldn't have come this far without you. I implore you all, focus on the good things of CoH and Paragon Studios. Don't dwell on the &quot;how&quot; or the &quot;why&quot;, but rather join us in celebrating the legacy of an amazing partnership between the players and the development team.<br />
Thank you, and I'll see you in the skies, one last time.<br />

   Effective immediately we have disabled sales via buy.guildwars2.com. To  be clear, box and digital sales are still available via our retail  partners. We are tracking our concurrency closely while expanding our  infrastructure.  We’ll re-enable first-party digital sales as soon as we  feel that we can do so safely. ~RB2</font></b><br />

This is awesome because it indicates that Arenanet cares about the game enough to forgo sales for quality of user experience and also, of course, because it means the game is doing well.</div>

<br />
This thread is comedic gold.  In summary there was a bug that allowed people to buy racial weapons and armor for dirt cheap with Karma.  They were buying them by the hundreds and putting them into the forge to make better stuff or for salvaging.  Here is a sample.<br />
<br />
<i>Shurrik Morosow how many did i do? any chances? thanks. did not sell anything</i><br />

<b>You used the exploit 253 times.</b><br />
<br />
<i>Hello, my in game name is illmaculate on server henge of denvari and I was also one of those people who bought a lot of these said items. I did not know it was a exploit at the time of doing so. I reached level 54 last night and was planning on getting my tier 2 items so I headed to the tier 2 vendor in hoelbrak to see if I could finally afford any of the weapons as I knew I would reach level 60 today (I did). When I got there I noticed the great prices and thought it might be some kind of promotion or just price drop for the release, I did not think much of it but made sure to buy my level 60 items and store them in bank. I was extremely excited as I knew I would be ready. A friend of mine notified me that I could try a forge by mixing the weapons so I started doing it and creating weapons for my further levels. In my account i have a level 71 weapon and 2 80 axes and greatsword which i made sure to save for when I reach level 80. I believe I spent around 14k karma to make my weapons which is roughly 666 items. I was experimenting with the forge and having fun. I also salvaged a couple things and also saved in my bank for further use. Only items i vendor where those useless slot items due to limited space. I never even knew about it before and in my account you will only see weapons that are exactly for my warrior toon. I agree my account should be temp banned, possibly rolled back but I feel extremely bad right now that I got hit with such a huge punishment. I would never do anything like this if I knew I was breaking some huge in game law by creating myself weapons. I hope I get a reply.</i><br />

<i>Soschautsaus was my Account name. Would be n1 if you guys could tell, me how often i &quot;exploited&quot; that. I had no idea, that that vendor wasnt planned.. i mean u had beta events and developed the game for a very long time and there is still such a substantial bug in that game? A rollback would be ok, and i would even accept a 3 days ban. But a Perma-ban? Since it wasnt my fault causing the problem i should not be punished that hard ~my2cents</i><br />
<br />
[–]ArenaNetSupportTeam 9 points 3 hours ago<br />
<br />
<b>Used the exploit 129 times</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>My character name is Trinz.<br />
<br />
Yes, I abused it. I'm not arguing semantics when I say this, but what is your definition of mild and heavy? I won't lie, I probably bought a couple hundred. I spent a couple thousand karma on this. However people have spent in the range of 20k-100k exploiting this, I would consider that heavy, I'd say the probably 20 or so 75-80 weapons I made would be mild when they're making hundreds. Feel free to reply, however I would like to request a removal of all the stuff I got this way and a 72 hour ban. I honestly can not afford to pay for the game again, and I absolutely love it. Just after the whole kripparrian freaking streaming to thousands of people getting them gold and then getting a 72 hour ban... yeah I got jealous after holding back on that and bought some weapons when I found out about it. If it matters I have submitted a support ticket asking for a change in my ban. <br />
<br />
This game is still new and I'm still figuring things out. My friend showed me how to do this and it was the first time I ever bought things with Karma so I didn't even realized how much I should have been paying. I regret what I did and I don't feel a perm ban is fair considering I didn't affect anyone directly by doing this exploit.</i><br />

[–]ArenaNetSupportTeam 6 points 3 hours ago<br />

<b>A couple of hundreds uses of an exploit is quite a lot. You were right in your estimate, you exploited 242 times.</b><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I read a lot about WvW before trying it, but was still pretty intimidating by just how much there is to it. I didn't have time to play properly yesterday so figured I would give it a shot. Ended up staying up way too late. :wtf:<br />
<br />
For starters, Shiverpeak server dominated us. I don't know if they are a pvp server or in a different time zone, but just one of their roving bands was the same size as our entire force put together. We even had an &quot;outnumbered&quot; buff, which doesn't give you power to try and even the odds, and instead increases exp, karma, and magic find. I found a ton of green loot as a result, but it almost feels like they are encouraging you to go farm the abundance of mobs in the zones instead of put up feeble resistance. I know coordinated guilds can beat a zerg larger than themselves, but our team was anything but coordinated. Half of them didn't know to always carry supply, and the other half complained constantly about the first half.<br />
<br />
Swamp of Sorrows server seemed to sense weakness and hit whatever side Shiverpeaks was not hitting. This proved to be a poor strategy, however, as as soon as Shiverpeaks was done with us, they turned around and dominated Sorrows as well.<br />
<br />
Despite all this, the few times I was in a 1vs1 I did quite well! I sort of wish I was recording a few of those fights. Although one mesmer did gank me horribly solo, most of the times I died was because of an overabundance of bored enemies looking for something, anything, to kill would find and steamroll me in the middle of a fight. And yes, I realize WvW is not about dueling. There are objectives that don't require large forces though, and it had already become apparent to me that our forces were not capable of defending against the enemy zerg. I felt much less useful in large groups than in skirmishing. <br />
<br />
So anyway, I will now share my favorite fight of the night. It was late and I was about to go to bed, but I wanted to feel like I had done something worthwhile with my time, so went to go find one of the skillpoints on the map. In the middle of the fight, a mesmer comes along and ganks me. I still want that skill point, so I wait a few minutes but then go back, cautiously. I do not see the mesmer, but instead see an enemy guardian killing the mobs. He activates a boss and has to kite it around for a few minutes, but I opt not to gank him. I only want the skillpoint.<br />
<br />
I'm waiting up above out of his reach, and trying to stay obscured from view. His fight ends and he starts running up a nearby ramp. &quot;Don't attack me, don't attack me, don't attack me&quot; I think, not performing the opening strike, hoping he is just going somewhere else. When it finally becomes clear that he thinks I am afk or a moron or something and is about to attack me, I immediately set up the combo I described in the Combo Combat thread. I hit lightning reflexes (a ranger dodge utility) and accidentally fall off the platform we are fighting on. I'm not hurt, but have to follow suit and run all the way around the ramp to return to the fight.<br />
<br />
I call off my pet so he won't kill it, and notice I had gotten him to half life, although he is easily able to heal back before I return. Then for reasons I do not know, he decided to engage the skill point mob himself, completely ignoring the fact that I am still in the area. I decide to punish him for harassing me, and begin attacking him from behind. He turns around to engage me (he is a guardian so probably thinks he is invincible), and in the ensuing scuffle I accidentally knock him off the ledge with one of my abilities. Figuring what the heck, I then began engaging the skill point mob myself, as he had already gotten it to half life. <br />
<br />
He ends up running back to me two or three times during the fight. The first few times I intentionally knock him off the side again, forcing him to make the run once again. The final time I messed up the knockback (or he was prepared for it), but the mob knocked him off instead. :grinyes: I then finally finished it off, and left the area, not caring whether he lived or died. All I wanted was the skillpoint you jerks. The end.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://youtu.be/wLPLiV709ss?t=1m26s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Don't start nothing, won't be nothing! </a>:p That mesmer though, ouch. The very first person I beat was a mesmer, so it isn't the class, it was the player. <br />
<br />
I also had a fight with a ranger, that I tried to avoid (I was just scouting the area from a ledge). I just barely beat him, but still ended up dying when his friends arrived. Again, I let him have the first shot, and he did a good job keeping me at range, but I think he lost because he insisted on sticking to some mental ideal of &quot;ranger&quot;. He was using a bear pet and longbow exclusively (as far as I could tell). Bear pets no do good damage, they are only good if the enemy is stupid enough to attack it! (which actually happened to me in the beta, I was :wtf: when I realized what they were doing)<br />
<br />
Anyway I bring it up because my biggest disappointment is I was never able to knock him off a cliff. I think he must have been a huge newb or something, as he was fighting with a cliff to his back for half the fight. But because he kept snaring me, I couldn't get close enough to use my knockback at the right time, and he would (accidentally) move when I finally did. So disappointing. Would have been so epic. And with my fall damage trait I could have easily followed him down.</div>

I have never used it for anything but Guildwars I/II and I have never posted on the ArenaNet forums, so it shouldn't be visible to anyone there.<br />
<br />
I got a &quot;password reset&quot; email from ArenaNet this morning.  The link in it legitimately goes to the ArenaNet password reset page, so it's not a scammer trying to get my password.<br />
<br />
My question is, how did they get this email address?  The only place I've used it is for GW I/II and my system is scanned for malware/spyware/viruses daily, so I doubt I have a trojan.<br />
<br />
What's going on here?  Was ArenaNet compromised somehow?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This thread is half public service announcement, half a place to put heads together about what works well together and what doesn't. Now, it's 4:30am and I should be asleep, so pardon if this isn't quite as coherent as I want it to be.<br />
<br />
<b>Combos</b><br />
<br />
So you may have noticed that some abilities come with a descriptive line akin to &quot;Combo Field: X&quot;, where X is something like Fire, Water, Smoke, etc. etc. You may also have noticed that other abilities include the line &quot;Combo Finisher: X&quot;, where X is Projectile, or Blast, or what-have-you. If you've been wondering what these &quot;combo&quot; things are, or why little two-toned hearts pop up over peoples heads in events, this is why. Combos are one-two combinations where one spell is affected by another, gaining certain affects.<br />
<br />
For example, as an elementalist I have a staff-fire spell Lava Font, which drops down a neat little volcano o' barbecue death. However! If I stand in my own little volcano, and execute a Blast finisher, I gain a three-stack of Might. Woohoo! And since I'm in Fire attunement, I pop my Glyph heal, and have a four stack of might, and everything catches on fire. Lovely, lovely fire. For a different example, my guardian has a whirl finisher and can drop Light fields; these add a &quot;Cleansing Bolt&quot; effect to the whirl attack. Or Burning bolt, if the field is Fire. Etc. Etc.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Combo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Guild Wars 2 Wiki Link</a> that should go through the various and sundry combinations of spells and abilities. I've found this is increasingly determining not only my weapons choices, but my utility skills as well; my Guardian's goto #8 skill drops a Fire field, which I can then smack with my trusty 2H hammer for Might x3, before autoattacking up to a Light field for a quick boost of Retaliation.<br />
<br />
Now, to keep this conversation ongoing; you can of course combo off of the spells that other folks drop, and I find myself trying to chain together attacks in events to set off some flashy stuff; I regularly burst water fields for a quick healing pulse for everyone, or I'll drop a Light field so all you ranged folk with projectile finishers can get some cleansing. What have you guys found that works well, both for your own benefit and for the benefit of others?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm stuck at work and won't be able to play today, so thought I would share an interesting theory I saw a few weeks ago concerning the Sylvari. Note that the information I will be discussing can all be gleaned from the first areas of the game, but I am going to put it in spoiler tags anyway because it has the potential to be a huge deal later on, if proven true.<br />
<br />
I saw the theory while checking to see if WoodenPotatoes had another lore video. He in turn got the information from some forum he reads. I'm going to summarize the information as I understand it, but I'll link the video if you want to listen rather than read. I sort of felt like he took too long getting to the issue.<br />
<br />
So one more warning, don't read this if you care about (possible) spoilers.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>possible spoilers</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>I'm serious!</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
The theory is that the Pale Tree, from which all Sylvari is born, is a dragon.<br />
 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
Woah what? Right? Supporting evidence below!<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>speculation</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
So first let's go over the simple background information.<br />
<br />
The Sylvari are a new race on Tyria, only recently awakened. Coincidentally during the same time when the dragons have begun to awaken. Some Sylvari even make mention of this in the starting zone. One girl wonders why else do they exist, if not to fight dragons?<br />
<br />
The lore behind the Sylvari states that a human warrior returned home to find his family murdered and his town burned to the ground. The human warrior swore off war, and began to trek around the world. On one such adventure he found a strange seed, which he eventually returned and planted at the location of his lost village.<br />
<br />
He also met an old Centaur (who the humans are warring with) who was also tired of war. They began a community that attempted to create a haven away from war, but it eventually dwindled and died as well. Before his own death, the Centaur (Ventari) created a philosophy and inscribed it's rules on tablets, and left them at the base of the tree.<br />
<br />
Eventually the Pale Tree grew, and started spawning Sylvari. It's important to note that they are generally fully functioning upon awakening. The time of their lives when they would be learning is done inside &quot;the dream&quot;. The dream itself is a stored collection of all Sylvari experiences and knowledge, though individual Sylvari are not exposed to all of it. The one thing they all (most?) are exposed to, is the wisdom from the Ventari tablets.<br />
<br />
This explains both the Sylvari's tendency towards righteousness and justice, their curious nature, and (I think) their humanoid forms. Next is the most interesting part.<br />
<br />
Every one of the playable races has an enemy force consisting of their own kind. With the Sylvari, they have &quot;the Nightmare Court&quot;. This is a group of Sylvari with negative impressions of other races, but more importantly, they believe that the Ventari tablets are evil and have corrupted their race. Their aim is to remove the Pale Tree of it's influence and return the Sylvari to their true form. They do this by saturating the dream with hatred and negative emotion (hence, the nightmare).<br />
<br />
Now anyone's first inclination is to dismiss this completely. From our own point of view, the Sylvari are good and the Nightmare Court is evil. But that's a human point of view, and Sylvari are not humans. I thought to myself that their argument actually makes a lot of sense. The tablets' teachings have created a race empathetic to civilization but they are absolutely not the most natural form they could possibly take. It's an outside influence, like if you pour radioactive waste on a pitbull and it turns into a guinea pig.<br />
<br />
I then heard of this theory and it all clicked into place. Dragons are described as forces of nature, so massive that they don't directly interact with those they are destroying. Their presence creates champions from lesser races that do the grunt work for them. The Pale Tree, or by extension &quot;the dream&quot;, could very well be a dragon representing nature itself. <br />
<br />
It's worth pointing out that the form the nightmare takes during the first few minutes of playing a Sylvari, is that of a dragon. And of course, this isn't the first time nature, dragons, and dreams have been combined into one entity. ;)<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Yeah, I know we already have a number of other GW2 posts up but I figured now's a good time to start a new one post-launch after things have settled down a bit.  My thinking is that this is for the people who are on the fence and interested in the game but intimidated by the other posts which aren't as focused on &quot;selling&quot; the game.  With that said, here are my thoughts.<br />
<br />
My, overly, long review of Guild Wars 2.<br />
<br />
First of all, I'd like to come right out and say that I love this game.  I'm having a blast and haven't had this much fun since the early days of Vanilla WOW.  That's not to say that there aren't issues but this game is a lot of fun.  <br />
<br />
The good - The game is simply beautiful.  They did an amazing job on optimizing things from the first open beta to launch.  It runs very smoothly and is very fluid.  <br />
<br />
The combat is amazing and definitely more skill based than WOW.  In WOW, your primary concern is to hit arbitrary caps of stats (+hit for example) and then you stand in front of an enemy and begin a rotation.  Things like Deadly Boss Mods tell you exactly how long you can stand in your spot working through your rotation before it's time to move.  As such it feels like you're playing the UI and not the game.  With Guild Wars 2, things are very fluid.  You are constantly moving and being forced to react to enemy abilities and movement.  It's not quite as good as TERA but it definitely feels like an evolution from WOW.  I know a lot of hardcore WOW players think that the game is &quot;clunky&quot; and &quot;un-responsive.&quot;  Compared to WOW it might seem that way because of how different the games go about combat.  In WOW, you hit a button and numbers appear.  In Guild Wars 2, things are animation based so you hit a button and your character swings his sword.  Once that sword connects with his enemy, numbers appear.  But that delay from hitting the button to seeing the numbers is a bit jarring to some long-time WOW players.<br />
<br />
There is a ton to do and see.  Because of this, leveling and experience gain are very natural.  You go to a new area, here, have some experience.  Check out a Vista?  More experience.  Discovered a new item while crafting?  Experience!  I spent hours going through all the nooks and crannies of Divinty's Reach and Queensdale to find all the points of interest, waypoints, vistas and so on.  And because this is a brand new game, everything is still fresh.  That will, obviously, change.<br />
<br />
Everyone is rewarded for everything.  You see someone attacking a bear?  Feel free to jump in and help out.  They will get the experience and loot from killing the bear and so will you.  It's also amazing when the big zone boss spawns and you have 30 people working to take it down together.  Yesterday morning the Shadow Behemoth spawned in Queensdale (Human starting area) and a ton of people went and killed it.  Once it died, a chest dropped and everyone who participated in the fight could open it up and get loot.  No kill stealing, no ninja looting and no resource node ganking.  If a mining vein is up and I mine it, the vein will empty out for me but the person who got there 6 seconds later will be able to mine it as well.<br />
<br />
Quests and events are VERY fluid.  It's easy to get caught up in things and lose track of time.  I can't count how many times I was thinking that I need to head back to Divinity's Reach (the human capitol city) and then get caught up in a Dynamic Event.  Two hours later I've completely forgotten that I was planning to head back to the city because one event led to another and pulled me WAY off course.  That's good stuff and I love it.<br />
<br />
The Bad - Launch day issues were pretty brutal.  The servers were slammed and people were unable to play for hours on Saturday.  The Trading Post (the auction house analogue) is, still, not working.  Mail is hit or miss right now.  These things are all normal with the launch of a big title but they are still annoying.  All of this will get fixed (if it hasn't been fixed already) but it still leaves a sour taste in people's mouths.<br />
<br />
Lack of content.  I know that this sounds weird because there is a TON of stuff to do, but, there are some severe leveling gaps.  You can't simply go out and do all the &quot;Heart&quot; quests (which are the closest thing you have to standard WOW's quests) and move on to the next area.  You need to keep up on crafting, exploration, dynamic events and your personal story and there are times where you are still going to be too low for the next area with everything lower level completed.  While some people might suggest going to a different race's area, I don't buy that argument.  I want to do Human stuff and I don't care about the Charr's problems right now.  When I create a Charr, then I'll worry about it.<br />
<br />
Indifferent - The big thing is that this isn't WOW.  That's going to be a major plus for some people and a major turn off for others.  Combat plays completely differently and questing doesn't hold your hand in the same way.<br />
<br />
Cash Shop.  This is going to make ArenaNet a TON of money.  I've already dropped $20.00 on it and I'm thinking of dropping another $20.00 for bank and bag upgrades.  Some people are going to be turned off by the very fact that you need to buy certain things (bank slots, character slots) from the cash shop.  On the other hand, if you don't need it NOW, you can always wait and as you farm up gold you will be able to convert that gold into gems (the real life money currency) and buy those same slots with gold instead of real money.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm burnt out on WOW.  It's not a bad game but I've done everything and seen everything.  The quest system and combat are very stale and boring.  The lore has gotten worse and the Pandaria storyline doesn't interest me at all.  There are enough big bad guys out there (Burning Legion, Sargares, Old gods, etc.) that Pandaria just seems out of place and weak by comparison.<br />
<br />
Overall I'd give this game an A- which is the same grade I'd give WOW.  Star Wars would have been somewhere in the B- range as a comparison.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So I only got to play in 2 stress tests, a total of about 3 hours.  I only got about 2 hours in last night... so I'm a total newb to this game.  Got some questions for the &quot;veterans&quot; :)<br />
<br />
1 - I saw someone mention in a video that you could mail stuff from your inventory to your bank.  How do you do that?  <br />
<br />
2 - Are there bonuses for completing everything in an area?  I see the achievement screen shows X out of XX events, X out of XX gathering, etc.  I understand the daily achievements (kill x mobs, gather x times, etc.)  Are there also &quot;completist&quot; achievements for completely clearing an area?<br />
<br />
3 - Is there a place to buy low level armor and weapons?  The only vendors I've found so far let you craft them it looks like (I didn't have the materials needed), but can you actually buy a starter set of gear?<br />
<br />
4 - If you leave an area, can you come back?  Like if I miss completing a quest, can I come back later and finish it, like in SwTor?  Or is that area, and any unfinished tasks done once you leave it?<br />
<br />
5 - What do I do with items marked 'trophy'?  Is there an NPC to turn them in to?<br />
<br />
Hmmm... that's it for now I guess.  Just wish I could log in...</div>
