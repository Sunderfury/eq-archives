<br />
To: the all administrators: Please distribute to them. I googled my graffe user name and the link below came up. BTW I didn't threaten legal action against the site, Nadiar requested it. HOWEVER You had best remove my posts from the website and the internet, particularly phone area code and old friends name. I'm not going to allow whatever damage it might do to myself and/or my old friend<br />

Steve's not damaged, he's fine - I just talked with him a couple hours back.  I use his name freely and openly because I've been calling him by it for 39 years now.  Your area code is of no consequence.  Between chuckles, I delivered the message you wanted delivered, that you were interested in him knowing you are interested in knowing what he's up to.<br />

Nadiar, I'll be happy to reach out to her directly if you think it'd be in the site's best interest.</blockquote>
