			Earlier this week, the upcoming Hitman reboot was quietly removed from the PlayStation Store in Europe, with Square Enix cancelling pre-orders for the PlayStation 4 version. With the game scheduled for release in just a few months, fans were understandably concerned. Was the game being pushed back? Was it being cancelled entirely? The accompanying message, that the &quot;configuration of the product... has changed significantly,&quot; didn't help matters.<br />
<br />
It turns out that Hitman was pulled because the game will now be released episodically. <b>When it launches on March 11, Hitman will include a prologue mission and just one location, Paris, for the cost of £12/$15</b>. Its next location, Italy, will launch in April, with Morocco following in May. Each additional episode will cost £8/$10, or £37/$50 for a season pass. &quot;Regular monthly content updates&quot; that will include three additional locations—Thailand, the US, and Japan—will arrive later in the year.<br />
<br />
Or, players can pay for the whole lot upfront for £45/$60. The complete season will also launch on disc at the end of the year.<br />
<br />
While the public outcry over the move is understandable given just how close to release Square Enix made the switch, that the publisher has moved Hitman to an episodic format should come as little surprise. As a full-priced game, Hitman's release schedule was a convoluted mess. There was the full £50/$60 game, which which contained three locations—Paris, Sapienza, and Marrakesh—featuring six campaign missions. Players were promised access to a further three locations, as well as all online content without further charge.<br />
<br />
Then there was the £28/$35 &quot;Intro Pack,&quot; which sounded an awful lot like a more expensive version of what Hitman is now, giving players access to the launch content and nothing else. Players could then upgrade to the full priced release for £24/$30. Pity the soul that had to navigate that lot just to get their hands on the right version of the game.<br />
<br />
This terrifying array of price points and varying levels of access to content was a poor decision on Square Enix's part, or at the very least poor messaging. But the stigma once attached to &quot;episodic&quot; games—which I've no doubt was part of the reason the publisher avoided calling Hitman episodic in the first place—has been slowly disappearing, and Square Enix has become rather enamoured with it.<br />
<br />
Life is Strange, Dontnod's brilliant episodic adventure series, has been hugely successful for the publisher, while, despite the backlash, the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Remake will also be episodic. Delivering an adventure game episodically is nothing new of course—Telltale has been doing successfully it for years—while for a game like Final Fantasy VII Remake, going episodic was perhaps the only fiscally responsible way of translating its enormously detailed world into a modern engine.<br />
<br />
The question is, where does Hitman fit into that? It's neither a classic adventure game, nor does it appear ambitious enough to warrant a staggered release. Perhaps Hitman has simply been chosen as the guinea pig to see whether such a format will work for a big-budget shooter. Or maybe the game simply wasn't going to be finished in time, or at least up to the standards expected.<br />
<br />
Whatever the reason, don't expect Hitman to be the last franchise Square Enix moves to the episodic format. It's already done it with one of the biggest franchises of all time, and now it's doing it with another. Moving the others should be no trouble at all.<br />

			The name “Strahd” is seared into the minds of any Dungeons &amp; Dragons player. It means vampires, it means gothic horror, and it means the iconic Castle Ravenloft. Today, Wizards of the Coast has revealed a return to the classic setting, and io9 has an exclusive look at one of the modules new storytelling mechanics.<br />
<br />
Curse of Strahd will find adventurers drawn into the magical mists that transport people to the nightmarish land of Borovia, the domain of the Vampire Lord Strahd von Zarovich, for the first time in the current 5th edition of D&amp;D. Not only is it a return to one of the most beloved settings of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, it’s also a return to the original creative team that introduced players to the setting—Tracy and Laura Hickman, who wrote the original Ravenloft adventure in 1983, are working with Chris Perkins, principal story designer at Wizards of the Coast, on the new module.<br />
<br />
Although adventurers will find themselves on familiar ground with a return to Ravenloft as they go toe-to-toe with Strahd himself, one of the new mechanics Curse of Strahd will offer to Dungeon Masters will keep the module fresh through multiple playthroughs. In Curse of Strahd, players will encounter a fortune teller named Madam Eva, who uses a deck of Tarokka cards to guide them on their quest to explore Barovia—and to coincide with the launch of the module, Gale Force 9 will be producing a physical version of the deck for Dungeon Masters to use. Here’s a look at some of the art for one of the cards, by Chuck Lukacs, making its debut here on io9:<br />
<br />
Dungeon Masters will be able to randomize the locations adventurers visit, altering the characters and artifacts they seek and the threats they face, by drawing blind cards from the Tarokka deck, offering the ability to customize the adventure for their parties time and time again, ensuring it’s always a little different—after all, what more could you want while exploring the horrifying lands around Castle Ravenloft than a few surprises?<br />
<br />
Both Curse of Strahd and the Tarokka card deck will be available to purchase from March 15th.

			     The main focus of this quarter will be  one of DDO's biggest milestones - our 10th Anniversary! We'll be  throwing a big party towards the end of February, with gifts, prizes,  events, and surprises. We will debut a free multi-character-level  dungeon (similar to the way our Night Revels dungeons work) that will be  a tongue-in-cheek story featuring some of DDO's most popular and  enduring characters and NPCs. It'll also give you the opportunity to  defeat some &quot;devs&quot; in battle. Yes, I plan to try to kill you in-game. <br />
<br />
       <br />
      <b>Update 30 will also debut the  long-anticipated Gnome race, along with the Deep Gnome Iconic!</b> We will  debut an updated Cannith Crafting system that ties in nicely with the  new randomly-generated loot system that released in Update 29. We're  also bringing out the bug zapper in the coming weeks to get rid of some  of the things we've been hearing from you about. We'll be previewing  much of Update 30 in the coming weeks on Lamannia. As always, we look  forward to your feedback.<br />
			
		<hr />

</div>I have always loved taking a spin through DDO.  I highly recommend the game.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This is simply out of curiousity and not something relevant to my life, but does anyone know if it is unsafe to breastfeed an infant (I guess this would apply to any age but breastfeeding an adult is not something I am curious about) for a longer period of time than it takes for drugs to leave someone's bloodstream or brain? <br />
<br />
If that was unclear, I am asking if say a woman who is breastfeeding drinks alcohol, will that be present in her breastmilk for a longer period of time than it takes for her to become completely sober i.e. are there detectable levels of alcohol in breast milk for a longer period of time than there is in the bloodstream. <br />
<br />
I am thinking possibly but don't know that for sure.<br />
<br />
A related question is, does a woman's diet or exposure to toxins affect child development when breastfeeding in the same way or to the same degree that it can affect a child's development while pregnant?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Since I got a ps3 last year for Dark Souls, I finally got around to playing <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?76583-The-One-Game-that-Needs-an-8-bit-Retrofit" target="_blank">Mega Man 9</a>.<br />
<br />
I've only played a few hours at this point, but it's fun.  It took awhile to get used to, it felt like I was beating my head against the wall for awhile until I finally beat Galaxy Man, and Hornet Man shortly after that (when I realized you could buy multiple energy tanks).  In general level design is very good, and flows just like the classic Mega Man games.<br />
<br />
I enjoy the difficulty except for one aspect: the insta-death platforming sections, especially if they involve ceiling spikes.  For me, there's too many and they are too tricky for how early in the game they are (sometimes before you even get to the level midpoint).  Occasionally, I don't mind getting stumped by a hard jump, but when there are 2-4+ tricky instant death jumps in every level I just start feeling annoyed at having to constantly repeat sections of the game because I held the jump button down just a tiny bit too long.  Beat Call and Spike Guard help a little, but only a very little since you can't save them to enable when you really want them.<br />
<br />
So far, Hornet Man, Jewel Man, Splash Woman and Tornado Man all have ceiling spikes and tricky platforming.  Plug man is the disappearing blocks level.  Magma Man is full of lava pits (though I have only tried his stage once so far).</div>

<br />
People used to tell me I should be a stand-up comedian, but that's a pretty shit job, so I dodged it.<br />
<br />
This just happened, about 2 hours ago.<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			<br />
So we had several pounds of pork riblets to use.<br />
<br />
They were SUPER cheap (&lt;$2/lb) and being the solutions-oriented person that I am, I concocted a way to cook them with what I thought would be minimal effort.<br />
<br />
6 quart crock pot, turn them into pulled pork for Cuban sandwiches.<br />
<br />
It’ll fall off the bones so I can pick them out with relative ease, the fat will melt off so there will be no trimming required, and they can go in completely frozen, so I don’t have to worry about uneven heating or thawing.<br />
<br />
Sounds ideal, right?<br />
<br />
I thought so too.<br />
<br />
In fact, it *was* ideal.<br />
<br />
The pork riblets get to the point where they have fallen off of the bone.<br />
<br />
I go through, pick the bones out, and start juicing some citrus fruit so I can go back to slow cooking them.<br />
<br />
Juice an orange. No problem.<br />
<br />
Grapefruit? Equally easy.<br />
<br />
Lime? Almost effortless.<br />
<br />
And then I see a can of Dole Pineapple Juice sitting on the counter.<br />
<br />
The sound of a change machine or slot machine paying out in loud coinage plays through my head. I might have even said “JACKPOT!” out loud.<br />
<br />
I knew we had two cans of the stuff.<br />
<br />
So, like you do, I grabbed the can and started to shake. Pineapple juice settles, and for full flavor profile, only truly homogenous pineapple juice, complete with pulp, would do.<br />
<br />
It should be pointed out, at this particular moment in time, that we have a side-cutting can opener.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Cook-Classic-Safe-Opener/dp/B000AX13US" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Good-Cook-Clas.../dp/B000AX13US</a><br />
<br />
Instead of cutting the top of the lid, it cuts around the rim on the outside side. This means that not only do you not have sharp edges, you can put the lid back on the can and it looks unopened.<br />
<br />
I would like to stress that very important point.<br />
<br />
LOOKS<br />
<br />
UNOPENED<br />
<br />
Cue vigorous shaking for what felt like about 60 seconds, but was probably, in reality, only half of one second because, out of NOWHERE time slows down.<br />
<br />
If I were Neo and this was the Matrix, I would have been dodging at this exact moment, because slightly less than FORTY SIX OUNCES of Dole Pineapple Juice geysered skyward like some kind of fruity-flavored fibery Mount Saint Helens, bent on devastating all clean surfaces with its sugary fallout.<br />
<br />
Then, another half second or so later, in the space of a blink, I couldn’t see.<br />
<br />
I think to myself: “Hey, that pineapple juice is about to go everywhere. Hey, I can’t see. Ruh-Roh Rhaggy.”.<br />
<br />
So I stop shaking the can (like you do), open my eyes and watch.<br />
<br />
I watch as nearly an entire can of upwardly mobile pineapple juice explodes outward in a manner very much akin to the pictures from Alamogordo in 1945.  The lid flips towards the floor like a casually discarded shuriken, or perhaps Michael Dudikoff’s career in Ninja movies, and most of the juice?<br />
<br />
The lion’s share of it?<br />
<br />
Hits me straight in the face.<br />
<br />
I stand there, unwilling to move for fear of making a greater mess as all the waterfalls of Oahu start cascading off of my hair.<br />
<br />
Being conscious of fluid dynamics, I tilt my head forward so that it runs off of the front, past my eyes, so I can at least appreciate the view while I smell like an island paradise.<br />
<br />
Several seconds later.<br />
<br />
Still cascading. At least it smells pleasant.<br />
<br />
Drip.<br />
<br />
Crap. I’m going to have to do laundry.<br />
<br />
Drip.<br />
<br />
Crap, I don’t know where my wife keeps the mop.<br />
<br />
Drip.<br />
<br />
Crap, I…no, wait, we replaced the kitchen light, it’s enclosed, so nothing should short out.<br />
<br />
Drip.<br />
<br />
I really hope that didn’t hit either of the cats.<br />
<br />
Drip.<br />
<br />
Drip.<br />
<br />
Okay, it’s been 15 seconds, we’re probably good now.<br />
<br />
So I look around and take stock.<br />
<br />
Let’s just say I’ll be taking a shower and scrubbing a lot of surfaces.<br />
<br />
I’m not sure if I should be happy that my grey hairs have now been dyed blonde-ish.<br />
<br />
What a waste of perfectly good pineapple juice.

			Netflix is thisclose to pulling the trigger on The Punisher, a new Marvel spinoff series centered on Jon Bernthal’s gun-toting Daredevil vigilante (aka Frank Castle), TVLine has learned exclusively.<br />
<br />
VIDEOSDaredevil Season 2 Teaser, Poster<br />
<br />
Viewers will get their first look at Bernthal’s Punisher when Daredevil ‘s second season drops on Friday, March 18, but the early buzz on the Walking Dead alum’s performance is overwhelmingly positive.<br />
<br />
“Viewers watching the show will be rooting for this guy with a gun but we’re also going to force people to second-guess themselves,” previewed exec producer Doug Petrie in a recent interview with EW.com. “Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky s–t.”<br />
<br />
For those keeping track at home, this would mark Netflix’s sixth Marvel series, following Daredevil, Jessica Jones, the upcoming Luke Cage, and the in-the-works Iron Fist and The Defenders.<br />
<br />
Reps for Netflix and Marvel declined comment.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>According to Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_in_Japan" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_in_Japan</a>), Japan makes shit houses on purpose. Now, the US generally makes houses in a manner that is nonsensical, but they are not purposefully wasting resources generally. This seems extremely contradictory to the rest of Japanese culture. <br />

So, anyone have a decent guess as to what motivates making shit housing on purpose and wasting resources in Japan? Another aspect that is strange about that housing culture is that Japan is also not notable for 3D printing manufacturing at the moment or prefab housing when if they are continuously rebuilding every 20-30 years they could save on scarce labor through either one of those avenues which is in contradiction with Japan's competitiveness in other computing areas that has direct synergy with that manufacturing style.</div>

When  most people think of Iceland, they envision fire and ice. Major  volcanoes and vast ice fields are abundant due to its position on the  northern part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Ridge" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>. <i>(A hot July day in Reykjavik is around 55 degrees.)</i> However, Iceland is also noted for being one of the <a href="http://grumblesfromanoldgrouch.com/the-scurge-of-socialism-under-construction/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nordic Socialist</a>  countries, complete with universal health care, free education and a  lot other Tea Potty nightmares. Therefore, as you might imagine, they  tend to view and react to economic situations slightly differently than  the U.S.<br />
When the banking induced  &#8220;Great Recession of &#8217;08&#8221; struck, Iceland&#8217;s economic hit was among the  hardest. However, instead of rewarding fraudulent banking procedures  with tons of bailout money, they took a different path.<br />
Prior to the recession, Iceland had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">one of the more thriving economies</a>  in the world, in spite of the fact that their total population  (327,000) wouldn&#8217;t even fill a mid-sized American city. When the  recession struck, they were among the earliest and hardest hit. However,  instead of running to the vaults to shower the banks with money, they  let the banks fail. They also resisted traveling down the  European/Republican austerity road. Instead, they kept their social  programs intact at a time when they were most needed.<br />
And, they sent fraudulent bankers to jail.<br />
When Iceland&#8217;s three major banks collapsed, it resulted in defaults totaling $114 billion in a country with a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">gross domestic product </a>(GDP)  of only $19 billion. In October, 2008 the parliament passed emergency  legislation to take over the domestic operations of the major banks and  established new banks to handle them. They did not, however, take over  any of the foreign assets or obligations. Those stayed with the original  banks, right into bankruptcy.<br />
They then brought charges against  several banking executives for fraud and market manipulation, resulting  in sentences ranging from four to five and a half years. As the special  prosecutor said,<div style="margin-left:40px"><b>Why should we have a part of our society that is not being policed or without responsibility?</b></div>In the U.S., we simply tapped a few wrists with <a href="http://theantimedia.org/why-the-5-7-billion-dollar-fine-on-big-banks-is-actually-a-joke/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">small fines</a>, that ended up being paid by their respective banks.<i>(Can you say &#8220;got off scot free?&#8221;)</i><br />
Sending  the bank executives off to play rock hockey for a few years didn&#8217;t  solve the problem, but it did send a message not to do that again.<br />
At  its worst, Icelandic currency, the Icelandic krona (ISK) was trading at  around 250 ISK per Euro. In order to qualify for an IMF (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">International Monetary Fund</a>)  loan, Iceland raised interest rates to 18%, which, of course, attracted  bank deposits. Iceland also received a $2.5 billion loan from Europe&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_countries" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nordic countries</a>.<br />
To  power its recovery, Iceland utilized its natural advantages such as its  clean, cheap geothermal energy to attract the tech industry. Icelandic  commercial fishing remained strong and as the general world economy  picked up, the tourist industry bloomed. The deeply depreciated krona  also helped make Iceland and Icelandic products very attractive,  economically.  On the banking front, they facilitated domestic debt  restructuring and fiscal adjustments as conditions changed.<br />
As to how it has all turned out, here&#8217;s what the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2015/car031315a.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">International Monetary Fund Survey</a> has to say about it:<div style="margin-left:40px"><b>Iceland  has rebounded after the 2008/9 crisis and will soon surpass pre-crisis  output levels with strong performance in tourism and fisheries. Debt  ratios are on a downward path and balance sheets have broadly been  restored. The financial sector is back on track though with some  important items remaining on the docket.</b></div>As the above survey also states, Iceland is &#8220;<b>the first 2008-10 crisis country in Europe to surpass its pre-crisis peak of economic output</b>.&#8221;<br />
The krona is now running <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=EUR&amp;to=ISK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">142 ISK per Euro</a>. <i>(up from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_kr%C3%B3na" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">290/1 in 2008</a>)</i> The 2014 inflation rate was 2.05%.<i>(down from 12.59% in 2008) </i>The <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/national-average-wage-index-nawi.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wage index</a> is running at 190.9. <i>(up from 132.8 in 2008)</i><br />
Btw, they did all this while keeping their social welfare intact. <i>(There goes another bagger day-dream.)</i><br />
Iceland&#8217;s President, Olafur Ragnar Grimmson <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/traceygreenstein/2013/02/20/icelands-stabilized-economy-is-a-surprising-success-story/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">explained how the country managed to recover</a> from the global financial disaster,<div style="margin-left:40px"><b>We  were wise enough not to follow the traditional prevailing orthodoxies  of the Western financial world in the last 30 years. We introduced  currency controls, we let the banks fail, we provided support for the  poor, and we didn&#8217;t introduce austerity measures like you&#8217;re seeing in  Europe</b>.</div>When asked whether or not other countries, Europe in particular, would succeed with Iceland&#8217;s &#8220;let the banks fail&#8221; policy, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/traceygreenstein/2013/02/20/icelands-stabilized-economy-is-a-surprising-success-story/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">President Grimmson gave his answer</a>,<div style="margin-left:40px"><b>Why  are the banks considered to be the holy churches of the modern economy?  Why are private banks not like airlines and telecommunication companies  and allowed to go bankrupt if they have been run in an irresponsible  way? The theory that you have to bail out banks is a theory that you  allow bankers enjoy for their own profit, their success, and then let  ordinary people bear their failure through taxes and austerity. &#8232;People  in enlightened democracies are not going to accept that in the long run.</b></div></div>

Second best is the bit about Kirstie Alley<br />

 Throughout <i>Frasier</i>&#8217;s 11-season run, Kirstie Alley was the only one of <i>Cheers</i>&#8217;  main actors to not make an appearance on the popular spinoff, possibly  because the psychiatric profession conflicts with her beliefs as a  Scientologist. &#8220;Kirstie once said ... she'd never do a show about a  psychiatrist,&#8221; <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,219462,00.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kelsey Grammer told <i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>in 2002.</div>

</div>I was watching Cheers on Netflix for the first time through and 80s fashion was a dark time for white people from head to toe, especially the hair. I did not realize Diane's mom was the same actress that played Tony Soprano's mom either. <br />
<br />
I was surprised that Cheers was almost cancelled early on because it seems like it would be super cheap to produce as most episodes are bottle episodes (the only set used is within Cheers, which saves a lot of production costs).<br />
<br />
I was really surprised how Cheers ended, thought that Diane and Sam would end up together for sure. The way it did end was way better though. Lilith is the best character on Cheers.</div>

<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			The actor Sean Penn said he has “a terrible regret” that the capture of the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo has distracted from his article in Rolling Stone, which he had hoped would start a national conversation about the war on drugs.<br />
<br />
“My article has failed,” Mr. Penn told the CBS host Charlie Rose in an interview to be broadcast Sunday on “60 Minutes.” An excerpt was released Friday.<br />
<br />
The article and Mr. Penn’s secret meeting with the fugitive head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, were widely viewed as a surreal development, stoked debate about journalistic ethics and raised questions about how Mr. Penn had been able to track down a high-profile fugitive who had eluded the authorities for six months after escaping from prison.<br />
<br />
Mr. Penn said he met secretly with Mr. Guzmán in October for the article, which the magazine published online on Jan. 9, a day after the drug lord was recaptured in a gun battle. Now, in his first extensive comments since the article was published, Mr. Penn told Mr. Rose in the interview taped on Thursday that he regretted how it all played out.<br />
<br />
“I have a regret that the entire discussion about this article ignores its purpose,” Mr. Penn said, “which was to try to contribute to this discussion about the policy in the war on drugs.”<br />
<br />
He continued: “Let’s go to the big picture of what we all want. We all want this drug problem to stop,” and later added: “And how much time have they spent in the last week since this article come out, talking about that? One percent? I think that’d be generous.”<br />
<br />
“You’re saying there’s not much dialogue about — ” Mr. Rose began.<br />
<br />
“My article failed,” Mr. Penn said.<br />
<br />
“As a result of El Chapo,” Mr. Rose said.<br />
<br />
“Let me be clear. My article has failed,” Mr. Penn said.<br />
<br />
In a stunning escape last July, Mr. Guzmán stepped into the shower in a prison cell and slipped away in full view of a video camera. Guards later discovered a small hole in the shower floor. But on Jan. 8, he was captured again after a gun battle in his home state, Sinaloa.<br />
<br />
Mr. Guzman’s arrest ended one of the most extensive manhunts undertaken by the Mexican government, involving every law enforcement agency in the country and help from the United States.<br />
<br />
Since then, Mexican officials have said Mr. Guzmán’s meeting with Mr. Penn was being monitored. Mexico’s attorney general said the authorities had been able to track down Mr. Guzmán because he met with actors and producers, a reference to Mr. Penn’s visit.<br />
<br />
Mr. Penn denied that his meeting with Mr. Guzmán had contributed to his subsequent capture. He said he believed the Mexican government said it had tracked his visit in part because they wanted to blame him and to encourage the cartel to put him in their cross hairs.<br />
<br />
“There is this myth about the visit that we made, my colleagues and I, with El Chapo, that it was — as the Attorney General of Mexico is quoted — ‘essential’ to his capture,” Mr. Penn said. “We had met with him many weeks earlier, on October 2nd, in a place nowhere near where he was captured.”<br />
<br />
“So, as far as you know, you had nothing to do, and your visit had nothing to do, with his recapture?” Mr. Rose asked.<br />
<br />
“Here’s the things that we know: We know that the Mexican government — they were clearly very humiliated by the notion that someone found him before they did,” Mr. Penn said. “Well, nobody found him before they did. We didn’t — we’re not smarter than the D.E.A. or the Mexican intelligence. We had a contact upon which we were able to facilitate an invitation.”<br />
<br />
“Are you fearful for your life?” Mr. Rose asked.<br />
<br />
“No,” Mr. Penn said.<br />
<br />
In a brief email exchange with The Associated Press this week, Mr. Penn said of his meeting with Mr. Guzman: “I’ve got nothin’ to hide.”<br />
<br />
Mr. Penn told Mr. Rose: “This is somebody who — upon whose interview could I begin a conversation about the policy of the war on drugs. That was my simple idea.”<br />
<br />
He added: “&#8202;&#8202;‘We’re going to put all our focus — forget about blame — we’re going to put all our focus, all our energy, all our billions of dollars on the ‘bad guy,’ and what happens? You get another death the next day the same way.”

		<hr />
		
			Raymond Schwab, an honorably discharged veteran, moved to Colorado last year to get treated for post-traumatic stress and chronic pain with medical marijuana.<br />
<br />
He didn't expect Kansas would take his children in return.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're basically using my kids as a pawn to take away freedoms I fought for,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a horrible position to put me in.&quot;<br />
<br />
He and his wife, Amelia, say Kansas took the five youngest of their six children into custody last April, and they've only seen them three times since.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think what we're doing is illegal, immoral or wrong,&quot; Amelia said.<br />
<br />
The Schwabs' case highlights how differences in marijuana laws can make a legal user in one state an unfit parent across the border.<br />
<br />
They're not the only Kansas parents at risk of losing their children over cannabis use. In Garden City,  medical marijuana advocate Shona Banda was arrested on child-endangerment and felony drug charges after her 11-year-old son talked about his mother's drug use at school.<br />
<br />
Kansas has rejected legislative efforts to permit medical marijuana use. Colorado legalized medical marijuana, then passed a referendum that allows recreational use as well.<br />
<br />
Child welfare officials in Kansas did not return phone calls Wednesday concerning the Schwabs.<br />
<br />
Raymond Schwab is a 40-year-old Gulf War veteran. He served from 1994 to 1996 in the Navy and later qualified for a 50 percent disability rating.<br />
<br />
He lived in Colorado when the state legalized medical marijuana and obtained his own card.<br />
<br />
He also tried to treat his symptoms with an assortment of medicines prescribed by the Department of Veterans Affairs &#8212; pain medicines, muscle relaxants, anti-anxiety drugs &#8212; but &quot;they were making me crazy, they made me worse,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Finally he developed a heroin addiction, but said he overcame that years ago with cannabis therapy.<br />
<br />
The turning point in his family life began with a VA job offer in 2013. He went to Topeka to work as a benefits agent for fellow veterans.<br />
<br />
&quot;I loved it. I loved my job,&quot; he said tearfully.<br />
<br />
But two years later, he decided to transfer to a VA job in Denver, where medical cannabis is legal. That's when a family squabble led to the loss of five children aged 5 to 16.<br />
<br />
Raymond and Amelia say that as they were packing to leave, her mother took the kids to a police station in another county and reported them abandoned, an action her mother now regrets.<br />
<br />
Nine months later, they say, child-protection workers and a Kansas judge are demanding that they give up cannabis if they want their kids back.<br />
<br />
One condition, they say, is four months of drug-free urinalysis tests, including a drug legal in Colorado for therapeutic uses.<br />
<br />
Raymond remains skeptical and worried. &quot;What if I didn't make it through four months?&quot; he asked. He fears his condition might worsen without cannabis.<br />
<br />
He and his wife question why Kansas child-protection workers are holding onto children who should not have entered their system in the first place.<br />
<br />
Among the documents Raymond carries in a battered briefcase is the one-page result of a Kansas child-abuse investigation.<br />
<br />
It shows that in April 2015, the state began investigating allegations that Raymond and Amelia emotionally abused all five children. Three months later, those allegations were dismissed as unsubstantiated.<br />
<br />
So, &quot;why do you still have my children?&quot; he asked.
