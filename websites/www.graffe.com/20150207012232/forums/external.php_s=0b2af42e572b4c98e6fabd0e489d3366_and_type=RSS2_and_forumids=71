I don't post about humble bundles often, but think this one might be big enough that someone might want to know about it. Humble bundle is the site where you pick your own price, and get games based on the pricing tier you chose. The money can either go to the developers or a charity. Right now their bundle is on Star Wars games.<br />
<br />
For $1 you get:<br />
<br />
Knights of the Old Republic<br />
Dark Forces<br />
Jedi Knight III: Jedi Academy<br />
<br />
If you meet the average donation you get:<br />
<br />
Knights of the Old Republic 2<br />
Battlefront 2<br />
Republic Commando<br />
<br />
For $12 you get:<br />
Empire at War<br />
The Force Unleashed<br />
The Force Unleashed 2<br />
<br />
Right now the average is about $12. This is unusual. A lot of people must be going for the highest tier, I guess for The Force Unleashed.<br />
<br />
If you don't have these games it is pretty great bundle. The historical low prices for all these games combined is somewhere around 35-40 dollars. I pretty much have everything but Empire at War so it isn't that attractive to me, but someone who hasn't purchased as many games could benefit.</div>

			Techland's new PC patch for zombie survival shooter Dying Light has restricted the ability to mod the game.<br />
<br />
The patch notes for update 1.2.1 state that the fix was implemented to &quot;block cheating by changing the game's data files&quot;.<br />
<br />
But the mod files themselves have been targeted, too.<br />
<br />
Fans had managed to disable the game's always-active film grain via a small 523-byte file, which was then shared via sites such as MediaFire and TinyUpload.<br />
<br />
That file is now unavailable - it has been removed due to a anti-piracy claim by the Electronic Software Association (ESA) using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).<br />
<br />
Reddit users discovered the DMCA ruling and quickly spread word of the find. But it is unclear whether the claim originates from developer Techland or publisher Warner Bros - or both.<br />
<br />
Previous Techland title Dead Island supported an extensive array of mods - the studio's upcoming demon hack-and-slash game Hellraid was originally born out of a Dead Island gun mod.<br />
<br />
We've contacted Techland for more information.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It looks like February is going to be a good month for gaming. It isn't quite as packed as I thought it was going to be a week or two ago, but there are still a lot of games to choose from.<br />
<br />
I'm awarding the title of biggest game of the month to <b>Evolve</b>. Evolve is an asynchronous co-op/pvp game made by the people who created Left 4 Dead, in which four players play as human hunters, with different class and weapon loadouts, and one player plays as a monster that evolves into more powerful forms over the course of the match. These developers have already proven they know how to make very fun multiplayer games, and while the structure might actually hurt longevity for some people, it is nevertheless the title with the widest appeal and the most likely to generate significant hype.<br />
<br />
Next up would be the PS4 exclusive <b>The Order: 1886</b>. When this was first shown most people, including Sony supporters, were skeptical. That might actually be a bit of an understatement, as people were concerned the developers would lean too heavily on cutscenes over gameplay, but as more and more actual gameplay has been shown I've seen this opinion gradually give ground. I'm still a bit skeptical myself, but we will see soon how it stacks up.<br />
<br />
We are also getting a new Resident Evil this month in the form of <b>Resident Evil Revelations 2</b>. Now this is a bit of an interesting one, as it is going to be released in an episodic format, but unlike most games with this business model, the content is apparently already done and will simply be released weekly. This being Capcom, you would assume they are just doing this to bleed you for more money, but even the most expensive version costs $40, not $60 like you might expect. Although it does have microtransactions. They are supposedly of the non-required type for people who want to pay for shortcuts, but who knows how obnoxious they will be.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is also a good month for handhelds, the 3DS in particular. The new version of it comes out this month, erroneously named <b>&quot;the New 3DS&quot;</b> by Nintendo (I'm not even kidding). If you already have a 3DS it isn't a substantial upgrade. Bigger screen, bettery battery, better 3D tracking, faster processor (so faster load times), and a tiny substitute for a right analogue stick. The timing is set to coincide with the re-release of <b>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</b> on 3DS, as well as <b>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</b>. <br />
<br />
I can't speak for Monster Hunter, but Majora's Mask is a very interesting game. I would recommend it to anyone who likes 3D Zelda but missed this one (arguably easy to do), or for people who like weird concepts that challenge conventional gameplay design. The concept of Majora's Mask is that you have 3 days to save the world before the moon crashes into the world, at which point the cycle starts over. Being a sorta-sequel to Ocarina of Time, you can also play songs to start the cycle over yourself. You retain progress in certain areas, so each cycle isn't done completely from scratch. The npcs of the world also have a schedule, so certain parts of that 72 hour cycle contain special events and particular times and places. The secondary mechanic of Majora's Mask is the power of equipping different masks for different effects. It gets a little weird, and I don't remember how well this part holds up.<br />
<br />
Both the Vita and the PS3, meanwhile, continues to get weird stuff out of Japan, if that's your thing. I honestly don't know anything about this month's selection, except to say I've seem light buzz for <b>htoL#NiQ: The Firefly Diaries</b> (Hotaru no Nikki) due to it's cute art style. The Wii U is getting <b>Kirby and the Rainbow Curse</b>. It's another game in the style of Canvas Curse (you draw a path for kirby to follow) that will probably be ignored. It also has a cute art style though, using a sort of claymation look.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, on PCs we have a remastered collection of the <b>Homeworld</b> games. Supposedly a new Total War is also coming out, but I've seen absolutely no one talking about it. Honestly, PC games are just as hard to keep track of as indie games lately. They don't get talked about and then suddenly they are out. Every week Steam has a stream of new games I've never even heard of being released. Apparently Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy) just got re-released, for example.<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Just a PSA to anyone who might not have played this absolute gem of a game.  It's basically a cross between The Legend of Zelda, Bushido Blade, Mike Tyson's punch-out, and the original Castlevania.  The combat mechanics are deep and the content design is amazing.  It's notorious for its challenge, but it's somewhat overblown in that regard.  If you play the game thoughtfully and carefully, you can often make predictions and be rewarded for creativity.  There's a blind &quot;Let's Play&quot; on youtube by user &quot;Kay Plays&quot; that exemplifies this approach.  Here's a <a href="http://youtu.be/c_TpExyw710?t=6m44s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">particularly awesome segment</a> where she encounters a very difficult enemy and makes heavy use of the environment to optimize her chance of winning.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the reasons why Dark Souls is awesome:<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">There Is More Than One Way To Do It.  Almost always, there are multiple viable tactics for dealing with any given situation, from overcoming environmental hazards to defeating bosses.  There are some principles that apply generally (observe the environment, learn the enemy attack patterns, stay alive first and attack only when you have an opening), and there are often certain weapons and techniques that are more effective than others, but that's it.</li><li style="">Near-perfect balance between gear, level, and player skill.  Level matters.  Gear matters.  It feels awesome to have your character get stronger and get more powerful weapons and armor.  But level and gear aren't enough, you still have to have skill to win.  And in fact, skill can often compensate for weak gear and low level.  The game can be beaten at level one.  There's a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/OneBros/?2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">whole subreddit</a> dedicated to this pastime.</li><li style="">Fantastic level design.  Each level presents a sequence of unique challenges.  Usually the initial content is very linear, sometimes with branching, and sometimes with buildings and basements and other non-linear elements.  There will be checkpoints along the way, like in classic platform games, so when you die you'll only have to start from the most recent checkpoint (bonfire).  There are minibosses and other non-respawning enemies.  Eventually you'll open up shortcuts that will let you bypass the trickiest areas.  And finally, you'll eventually discover shortcuts from later areas to earlier areas.  The entire world fits together like a puzzle and once you've unlocked all the shortcuts, getting from place to place is very easy.  By the time the world is big enough that running around would be a huge pain, you'll have the ability to warp.  And most importantly:  once you know your way around the world, you realize there are tons of opportunities for &quot;sequence skipping.&quot;  This makes the game feel truly &quot;open world&quot; even though it's designed to accommodate a very linear playthrough.</li><li style="">Rewarding challenge and memorable bosses.  Hard to talk about this without spoiling anything (spoilers: <a href="http://youtu.be/YvOUPdBgV1Y?t=9m31s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgszgbjfBcE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctW277Kpcv0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">3</a>)</li><li style="">Emphasis on exploration and combat.  The game is dense with the best kind of gameplay content.  There aren't any &quot;quests&quot; like is typical of RPGs.  You never have to find 10 green chicken feathers or deliver a donkey scrotum from point A to point B.  There are some gorgeous views and fantastic set designs, but very little is designed just to run through and admire.  (There is a giant city, which is suitably giant and does take a long time to run through, but that's the exception)</li><li style="">Consistent, surreal theming.  Plot that stays out of the way of the fun.  There are very few NPCs and most of their dialogue is streamlined.  It's suitable to the theming and characterization, without any need for dramaticization (but they do seriously all have creepy laughs).  The game starts you off with a simple goal:  go ring a bell.  Then you run into a guy who says &quot;oh yeah there are actually 2 bells you have to ring.&quot;  Ringing both bells is the end of Act I (30-40+ hours).  You get a short cutscene that shows you where to go next.</li><li style="">Fantastic replayability.  Due to that balance of gear, level, and skill I mentioned earlier, along with the general open-worldiness, means that there are dozens of different ways to play the game.  You can see how many sequence skips you can make to optimize your power to to completely wreck the early-game bosses that gave you so much trouble on your first playthrough.  Or you can go the opposite direction and stick to a low soul level, re-discover the original challenge and find new challenges.  You can play as a pryomaniac axe-murder or a heavily-armored knight.  </li></ul><br />
<br />
Generally speaking, people discourage spoilers, especially content spoilers, when playing Dark Souls and that's true but I don't think it will &quot;totally ruin the experience.&quot;  One thing to realize though is that missing little bits of content like items and armor is not likely to screw you in the way that it can in some other games.  This is partly due to the game's fantastic, 3-dimensional world and level design that is full of shortcuts and areas that loop around and connect to each other.  Typically, once you get past the most challenging part of a level, you'll have an opportunity to open a shortcut to bypass that section the next time you come through.  Then when it seems like you've progressed through several zones, you'll find yourself back where you started.  This means that even if you miss something, it's not too hard to go back and find it later.  Additionally, finding every weapon and armor in the game is mostly just going to leave you with a cluttered inventory of equipment that you never bother to use.  Increasing your character's power is much more about upgrading weapons with commodity upgrade materials than finding Excalibur or Ragnarok.  Though there are a few items available early in the game that can obscure this dynamic (Drake Sword, Black Knight Sword)<br />
<br />
The main exception to this &quot;no content is truly missable&quot; rule are NPC storylines, which can be permanently screwed if you progress past a certain point without fulfilling requirements.  But unlike some games, NPC sublots aren't a huge part of Dark Souls.  Also, this game has enormous replayability.  Even though I am pushing 200 hours for my first playthrough and have just two bosses left, one is the final boss for the game and the other is the final boss of the DLC, now that I know the game pretty well I could get through it again much more quickly if I specifically wanted to try and complete a particular NPC questline.<br />
<br />
Given that this is a wizard forum, I will point out that the game is VERY melee-oriented.  That said, there's a great variety of spells in the game, with a ride range of utility in and out of combat.  There are several varieties of projectile as well as mists, &quot;burning-hands&quot; type spells, and a few PBAoE attacks.  There's even a charm spell (though I've never used it).  In fact a Sorcerer build is one of the best builds for speedrunning.  But this is definitely not D&amp;D, there aren't 100 different utility spells to accomplish everything under the sun, and no godly one-hit-kill kind of spells.  Even though you can configure builds to do ridiculously powerful spells in the right situations, that usually involves doing things like using a buff that drains health and a ring that buffs your damage output when you are low health (consider the implications of that combo).  There's also no real crowd control spells, barring a few knockbacks and that one charm spell (which is fairly limited use).  Crowd control in this game primarily has to be done via the environment or pulling one at a time.<br />
<br />
Anyway I could go on forever singing this game's praises, and since the game is like 4 years old at this point I'm sure no one cares, so I'll just leave it there.</div>

tips: 
 
some races get a random stat boost after eating so many of specific types of food: 
ratlings = cheese

<br />
tips:<br />
<br />
some races get a random stat boost after eating so many of specific types of food:<br />
ratlings = cheese<br />
insectoids = spiked fruit<br />
lizardmen = turtle eggs<br />
the items are additive, doesn't matter how long between each use.<br />
first stat boost requires 3 items, next is 4 etc<br />
<br />
at start try and get your melee or ranged characters to have at least 20 or so accuracy to start the game, as it makes big difference in whether you hit or not and maybe increase the accuracy skill if need<br />
note high dex characters usually don't need accuracy increases or not much<br />
<br />
Suggested party for ordinary difficulty<br />
<br />
<br />
RATLING ROGUE<br />
give him MUTATION and EVASIVE ability, he will be a front line rogue relying in evasion and light armour and increased hit points to survive. the mutation ability randomly raises an ability so it's very helpful<br />
put dex to max, and vitality up, run him as a dagger wielding, evasive front liner<br />
arm him <i>only </i>with daggers as soon as you can, daggers increase damage with dex<br />
when he can dual wield he can do tons of damage to enemies that don't have high armour<br />
so you want to increase his <b>light weapon </b>skill, so he can dual wield<br />
<b>armour skill</b>so he can wear light armour so only need 2 points of this skill<br />
<b>critical skill</b>, since he attacks a lot and has high dex he will crit a lot <br />
when I find or make vitality potions, or the book that increases hit points, I give it to him, so he can last longer<br />
when I get the serpentine bracer that adds +50 poison resist I give it to him<br />
<br />
(alternatively you could try a insectoid Knight or barbarian with Heavy Weapon skill, or battlemage, bit tricky with battlemages but they can actually be the best tanks but require more understanding/careful character build<br />
Fighters are mostly pointless because holding down a weapon for special attack is waste of time rather than attack with other folk, so I only use special attacks when I want a special effect like life drain, hit enemy from side as I wait for them at an L shaped passageway)<br />
<br />
LIZARDMAN BARBARIAN (or Knight, don't bother with fighters, IMHO, barbarian is better than knight I think, purely because he does more damage and has health to make up for less protection)<br />
give him the <b>resistant </b>trait, so he has very high resists and up to you but I'd suggest either Martial training for accuracy or the regeneration ability<br />
go with Heavy weapons, armour, accuracy and critical skills<br />
he can really tank and dish out damage<br />
<br />
(back rank)<br />
<br />
MINOTAUR ROGUE<br />
this sounds odd but is really good, make him a thrown weapon specialist!<br />
thrown weapons increase damage with strength, minotaurs have high strength<br />
take the &quot;head hunter&quot; trait to start with and martial training trait, as you collect skulls in his inventory his damage increases<br />
Increase his thrown weapon, accuracy and crit skills<br />
as minotaurs have low dex make sure to have his accuracy around 20, maybe give him dex potions or items and hence the Martial training trait <br />
though the ratling rogue could do with Dex items as well, up to you.<br />
throwing uses &quot;energy&quot; may need to increase that with Willpower items/potions later on when you can throw two weapons at a time<br />
when he can throw shurikens AND daggers etc at same throw, his damage goes through the roof<br />
<br />
HUMAN ALCHEMIST<br />
take trait that increases experience, and one that gives extra skill point<br />
increase his willpower to max<br />
run this guy as an alchemist/wizard do NOT take any points in firearms or any other weapons!<br />
boost his energy<br />
if you find a skill up book (I've found one so far) give to this guy, he needs it because he has to have most skills points to buy all the abilities you need<br />
you want to max alchemy or get it to 4 fast as you can, since improved heal potions help tons, but at skill 5 he can make 3 bombs at a time, and crucially, stat increasing potions<br />
always make sure he has spare spaces in inventory so his plants can increase as you move<br />
never ever use the last 1 of a plant in his inventory<br />
crucially you can find crystal flowers, used to boost stats permanently, go check maps etc there's one easy to get at Sleet Island<br />
he can't cast spells until you raise his concentration skill to one and put an orb, wand or staff in his hand<br />
lvl 2 concentration = Light spell, this is extremely helpful<br />
lvl 1 fire - fireburst spells, great on zombies, insects and most others<br />
lvl 3 air = invisibility, and if your rogue has high enough skill in critical can backstab if behind enemy so you can sneak up for big damage<br />
Forcefield requires 2 concentration skill, very useful, cube of force, great way to block an enemy to the side or cage them helplessly for a while<br />
Up to you what Element to increase most<br />
since Human with XP boost he may hit lvl 15 or more by end of game, but you cannot max all magic skills<br />
Fireball is 3 Fire , 1 Air skill<br />
Each element has it's own party protection shield that requires 3 of that skill (folk say fire shield is very handy at end of game)<br />
<br />
<br />
you get a dagger with lifedrain ability, if you use it on the undead it does the OPPOSITE and drains your health :p<br />
<br />
to see in water easier, turn graphics setting to LOW<br />
<br />
Gold Keys are rare, unlock areas with special loot<br />
<br />
the CACHE dungeon in Forgotten River area outside castle, has one of the best items in game, chose the locked room with the rope, because that rope lets you go down pit traps etc without being hurt, just right click next to a drop! :) you find tons of loot etc at bottom of pit traps<br />
also has serpent bracer, +50 poison resist very handy indeed<br />
<br />
note <i>tons </i>of secret doors, with buttons on walls<br />
<br />
shovel lets you dig up buried chests, each zone usually has 1 or more, most require lock picks ot open, lockpicks are rare, the loot is not random, so save before opening, if the treasure is no use for you, don't waste lockpick and reload.<br />
<br />
only two weapons in game can be used underwater, Zarchitron trident is one<br />
<br />
the Tome of Leadership that raises ALL party stats by 1 so long as the reader is alive, I give to the toughest back rank character, long as he lives, all get big boost.</div>
