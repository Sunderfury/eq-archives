Last I heard he had retired long before GoD was out. Since his guild jumped ship to WoW I seriously doubt he's back playing again.</div></div><hr />

He left BotS and then tried to ebay his wiz for an obsene amount of money. Not sure if he actually has sold it but he's not playing anymore.</div></div><hr />

Side note, I said it in another thread but will here again. TP had around 20 level 70s within the day of launch. I know of people hitting it within 8 hours... GMs thought this was way too fast and reset them all back to 65. As far as I've heard TP had the first L70s and the most, the quickest.<br />

Kiting and mezzing mobs for virtually free XP is a bit over the top though. Not sure about TP but some guilds had it taken away because they were sploiting. GM's are correct to take a stand.</div></div><hr />

Saw him online for the first time in months in KT yesterday.  He was level 66 still.<br />
<br />
First wizard to get 70 on Vazaelle was Verdad I believe.  But nowadays with fire AE, I guess it depends on what you consider credible levels.</div></div><hr />

But there were like 20-30 non-wizards to hit L70 before any wizard, including 4 rogues including me &lt;3. (omgz!!11! nerf halfling xp bonus!!1)<br />
<br />
I'm 99% sure that the second wizard to 70 was Brand, of Hoss.</div></div><hr />

He transferred from some other server just in time for the 65 grind and with the virtual collapse of Ascent I assume he quit or returned to his homeserver. I really doubt you'll find much more specific info as our server's elite has gone a complete turnover for about the 3rd time.<br />
<br />
I believe Domagio from Luclin was also an Ascent transfer. I suppose it must have been right after the release of PoP and as best I know he just recently quit or transferred back to Luclin.</div></div><hr />
