			<b>Early this morning, TMZ reported that a buried knife had been recovered from the O.J. Simpson estate by a construction worker at some point between 1998, when the house was demolished, and “several years ago.” The construction worker turned it over to an LAPD officer who was on the street, who turned out to be working private security for a movie shoot, and kept the knife for himself. </b><br />
<br />
In incredible timing for the renewed media attention on the O.J. Simpson murder trial via both Ryan Murphy’s new show and a forthcoming ESPN documentary, this twice-buried knife was brought to light only very recently: by TMZ’s account, the cop retired, then contacted a friend in the LAPD’s Robbery Homicide Division, asking for the case number for the Simpson/Goldman murder, so he could engrave it on the frame he was purchasing for this O.J. knife.<br />
<br />
By 10 a.m., the LAPD had confirmed the story to NBC4, and at 12:30 p.m., they held a press conference. Andrew Neiman, a police captain in the media relations division, gave a few more details: most notably, that they will not be releasing the name of the officer who had the knife in his possession, who reportedly believed that the O.J. case was closed. (As no conviction had been secured, it technically remained, and remains, open.)<br />
<br />
“As I explained at the beginning,” Neiman said, “any case that we don’t have a conviction on all of the charges or we’re not able to prove to our satisfaction that we’ve proved the facts of the case, remains an open case.”<br />
<br />
He also specified that he “shouldn’t be calling it the O.J. Simpson case. This is the Nicole Brown case. This is a double homicide that is still open and ongoing.” Investigators in Robbery Homicide are treating it “as we would all evidence, so it has been submitted to our lab. They are going to study and examine it for all forensics, including serology and DNA and hair samples, and that is ongoing as we speak.”<br />
<br />
The first question he took was from a reporter who asked about his reaction, upon hearing that an LAPD officer had withheld evidence in what “many would call the biggest murder trial in L.A. history.” Neiman said, “I was really surprised. I would think that an LAPD officer—if this story is accurate, as we’re being told—would know that any time you come in contact with evidence, that you should and shall submit that to investigators. I don’t know why that didn’t happen, or if that’s entirely accurate, or if this whole story is bogus from the get-go.”<br />
<br />
When asked about whether or not the officer could be called up for obstruction of justice, Neiman said, “I don’t know that. We will look into potentiality of any criminal charges that may be involved here.”<br />
<br />
Neiman also specified that the cop retired in the late ‘90s, not more recently, as TMZ’s story implied. “It was brought to our attention that this retired officer had an item that was believed to or alleged to be possibly taken or recovered from the Rockingham estate back in the ’90s. Once we learned about that, we followed up.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know how the contact was made,” he added.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Immersive virtual reality headsets have been something people have been trying to make for decades now, and in the span of the next month consumer versions will finally be available. It's always been kind of a pipe dream, but improvements in technology have finally created headsets with a high enough resolution, frame rate, and low enough input lag to make a decent experience. While the barrier to entry is kind of high, I thought it might be fun to have a thread laying down the options in case anyone does decide to become an early adopter and try it. There's no rush, however, as this stuff is probably the future in the same way smartphones were the future once.<br />
<br />
The two major players are Oculus Rift, owned by Facebook, and the HTC Vive, in cooperation with Valve. They have similar capabilities with slight changes in the execution. The Oculus Rift launches on March 29th, while the Vive launches April 5th. The Rift launches at $600, while the Vive launches at $800. This is somewhat offset by the fact that the Vive is launching with it's special motion controllers, while the Rift comes with an Xbox One controller and the motion controllers not becoming available until later in the year. These special controllers are what enable hand tracking within a game while still giving a high level of control over the experience.<br />
<br />
System requirements are similar for both. You need an Nvidia GTX 970/Radeon R9 290 gpu, an Intel i5-4590 or better cpu, and 4-8 gigs of RAM. The Rift seems to require more USB ports, while the Vive requires a large room, as it uses lasers for motion tracking. I'm unsure if the Rift has anything like this, but the Vive also apparently syncs with your smart phone, and has a front facing camera, both designed to reduce the amount of isolation you get from putting on a VR headset.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure of the full extent of games and app support for the various platforms but the Rift launches with Lucky's Tale and Eve Valkyrie, while the Vive launches with Fantastic Contraption and Job Simulator.<br />
<br />
<br />
The third player is Sony with their Playstation VR, which won't launch until later this year. The technologies seem similar, and will run off of a PS4 instead of a PC, but details like price haven't been worked out yet.<br />
<br />
If you want VR on the cheap, you have a couple other options (which have actually been available for awhile). Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR. Both utilize your phone (Gear VR requiring a Samsung Galaxy), and both can be had for less than $100. As the equipment is less sophisticated and not built specifically for VR, the experience is not ideal, but it's a cheap way to try VR without the high cost.<br />

Now, I haven't actually been following this stuff that closely myself, but last year most of the games seemed more like tech demos and I was dubious as to what kind of support these systems would have at launch. A little googling has surprised me with how much is going to be available. These links include commentary and Youtube clips. As I haven't watched them all myself, I may post a few if any look particularly interesting later. I also encourage everyone else to post anything that looks interesting to them (Ackar posted a neat card game/rts in <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?78509-The-Conduit-developer-is-making-a-CCG-for-Oculus-Rift" target="_blank">Other Games</a> last week, for example).<br />

<br />
<br />
And finally, the only thing more fun than trying VR is watching someone else try VR. Simultaneously, the one thing that pushes support for new technology forward faster than video games is porn. So I leave you with a hilarious and NSFW (for subject matter and language, the video itself is censored) video of people reacting to trying VR porn for the first time. Not to derail the thread with that stuff already, but man it's funny. Be warned that this may lead you down a rabbit hole that is more scary than funny, but still funny.<br />

			<title>Legalizing Recreational Drugs</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The Drug Trade has long been associated with violence throughout North America.  Powerful Cartels and Gangs have emerged to fight (often using violence) for control of resources and territory.  This violence often represents a direct threat to state and government legitimacy, whether on a national or local scale.  It's reasonable to hope that legitimizing recreational drugs would relieve tensions between drug producers, distributors and governments and between international governments.  This would result in less violence, as producers and distributors may invest in productivity over control of territory.  For more, you can see a somewhat sensationalized and biased but reasonably insightful summary in this little slideshow: <a href="https://prezi.com/c3mrm-i89pje/negative-externalities-of-the-war-on-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Negative Externalities of the War On Drugs</a><br />
<br />
This is also predicated on the notion that it will never be politically or socially feasible to stymie the demand for recreational drugs in any meaningful way.  Though if I were a dictatorial despot, I'd probably solve the drug problem by going after users with draconian measures.<br />
<br />
There are undeniably negative consequences of recreational drug use-- healthcare costs, effects on children, DUI-- but I'm setting those aside for the moment.  And yes, I'm talking about heroin, cocaine, crystal meth, MDMA, PEDS-- everything.  Let individuals self-regulate.  For the moment, I'm considering the social consequences as relevant as the social consequences of playing World of Warcraft or using Instagram.<br />
<br />
It might not be as easy as it sounds.  The criminal organizations engaging in drug production and trafficking typically engage in other criminal activity as well, such as smuggling, human trafficking, and protection rackets.  Some are not likely to just give up their power and freedom to compete fairly.  It is likely that any attempt to legalize drugs would require a simultaneous push to deal with the well-armed cartels and street gangs.  Blood diamonds, aka &quot;conflict diamonds&quot; are proof that legality of a commodity doesn't guarantee there won't be associated violence.  But it certainly seems plausible that it could work.  Trading the high-risk, violent strategy for a lower-risk strategy could be attractive to many.<br />
<br />
There would be other economic consequences.  Drug production is at least partially agricultural, and would result in allocation of farm use for drug-related cash crops that might otherwise be used to produce food.  On the other hand, this might help prevent drug wealth from concentrating in the hands of a very small number of criminal elites.  By opening up competition in production and distribution, profit margins could be driven down, at least somewhat.  This might not happen, though, since legalizing recreational drugs could cause the demand skyrocket even higher than it is now.<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider is the complexity of pharmaceuticals.  They're currently heavily regulated for safety reasons, and opening up a whole lightly-regulated recreational drug market seems like it would have an unknown impact on the medical drug industry.</div>

			The Oklahoma State House approved a new bill Tuesday that would create a new fund dedicated to spending money on public anti-abortion efforts, especially in schools. The idea, according to the bill, is to “clearly and consistently teach that abortion kills a living human being and is against public policy.” <br />
<br />
The Tulsa World reports that the new bill passed 64-12, although one-fourth of the legislature skipped the vote altogether. HB 2797, which was introduced by Rep. Ann Coody, seen above, and which you can read in full here, creates a new fund, the very descriptively-named “Public Education on the Humanity of the Unborn Child Fund.” The money in there will be used, among other things, to “establish, operate and maintain a program to educate students in grades nine through twelve about the humanity of a child in utero.”<br />
<br />
The bill also places an emphasis on trying to get women not to abort by creating a list of agencies “available to assist a woman through pregnancy, upon childbirth and while the child is dependent:” <br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			The Department shall index this information geographically and shall make it readily accessible on the Department’s website. The website shall include the following statement: “There are many public and private agencies willing and able to help you to carry your child to term and to assist you and your child after your child is born, whether you choose to keep your child or to place him or her for adoption. The State of Oklahoma strongly urges you to contact them if you are pregnant.”
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The bill would also require new public service announcements about abortion being bad:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Develop and distribute educational and informational materials, including audiovisual materials, to provide public information through public service announcements, media and otherwise for the purpose of achieving an abortion-free society. Such materials shall be developed from the most readily available, accurate and up-to-date information and shall clearly and consistently teach that abortion kills a living human being and is against public policy;
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The bill has been sent to the State Senate; if approved, it would take effect November 1. <br />
<br />
Oklahoma state law doesn’t require any sex education whatsoever, and a 2014 report found that sex ed classes varied widely in quality and whether they even existed. A bill dubbed the Safe Relationships Act died in committee this month; it would have established a once-a-year public school program to help teach parents how to talk to their children about “pregnancy prevention, abstinence practices, prevention of sexually transmitted infections and diseases, and safe and healthy relationships.”

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Observations:<br />
<br />
It is known based on the 2008 &amp; 2012 elections that the RNC's constituents prevent the RNC from having any success. Since the advent of the Tea Party in conjunction a disproportionate amount of old fucks, the people who are the most influential in primarys, also inadvertently prevent the RNC from being able to field a candidate who can capture swing voters without also always being the same and opposite of every issue at some point in the year running up to the election. The disposition necessary to win the primarys also is exactly the disposition preventing what should have been an easy win in 2012 and 2016.<br />
<br />
There is no reason to expect this trend to go away on its own. Given a Cruz/Trump Gordian Knot Murdoch, Koch et al. realize that if they throw the election by blockading the SC nominee, they will be no worse off on eventual SC justice (Obama and Hillary are both extremely conservative) and likely achieve a better outcome due to not being a Cruz/Trump nominee. <br />
<br />
The advantages are better outcomes on the next 1-3 SC nominees depending on how many vacate their seats in the next ~5 years. <br />
<br />
An opportunity to minimalize the Tea Party faction, a demographic that is a RNC lock in any case, and expand the current RNC base which will allow the RNC to win a general election in 2020.<br />
<br />
And it mitigates the nonzero probability Trump originates as a HRC foil and cannot be relied on for RNC concerns.<br />
<br />
The disadvantages are none.<br />
<br />
Who is joining me people watching in the corner?<br />

<br />
Works at the level of Hawkings non-technical publications are what I have in mind here as examples of what level of technical density is useful here.  Small, reasonably good conceptual explanations that communicate the skeleton of the concepts/significance without burying the reader in a dissertation dense with wizard glyphs and black magic.<br />
<br />
Outside of Hawking, what are some other examples for the otherwise difficult to catch a glimmer of space physics stuff.</div>

They then start the background check process and someone asks me &quot;Are you sure you want to work at this company?

The moral of the story is basically, even if you really don't want to work for a particular company, don't shame them on Facebook or you will confuse their HR people. Also Facebook's privacy settings mean nothing.</div>

<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Apple's second high-profile patent win against Samsung was appealed, just as the first was. And in an <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/15-1171.Opinion.2-24-2016.1.PDF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">opinion (PDF) </a>published today, a panel of appeals judges entirely wiped out Apple's victory and its $120 million verdict.<br />
<br />
The new decision found that out of three different patents Apple became famous for winning with, one wasn't infringed and two of them are invalid.<br />
<br />
The '647 patent described how to turn phone numbers and other software &quot;structures&quot; into links, allowing users to take actions like calling a number with one &quot;click&quot; rather than copying and pasting. The jury awarded Apple $98.7 million based on that patent, but the appeals judges today held that the patent wasn't infringed at all. They held that &quot;Apple failed to prove, as a matter of law, that the accused Samsung products use an 'analyzer server' as we have previously construed that term.&quot;<br />
<br />
Appeals judges also invalidated one of Apple's most consistently ridiculed patents, the '721 &quot;slide to unlock&quot; patent. Jurors awarded $3 million based on infringement of that patent, but the appeals panel said the patent is invalid because of prior art.<br />
<br />
The appeals court was convinced by two pieces of prior art for &quot;slide to unlock.&quot; First, there was the Neonode N1, a Microsoft-powered touchscreen phone that pre-dated Apple's iPhone by a few years. Samsung lawyers trotted out a &quot;Quickstart Guide&quot; for that phone, which instructed its users to &quot;right sweep to unlock&quot; the phone. However, the phone didn't have &quot;a moving image associated with the gesture.&quot;<br />
<br />
But that missing step had also been disclosed well before the iPhone unveiling. Samsung pointed to a paper and accompanying video presented at a 1992 &quot;computer-human-interactivity conference.&quot; That paper, by a research scientist named Catherine Plaisant, describes a variety of on/off switches that could be used in a touchscreen environment, pictured below. The controls include a &quot;slider toggle&quot; that could be moved with a finger.<br />
<br />
Apple argued that a &quot;skilled artisan&quot; wouldn't have combined those two references, because the Plaisant paper described wall-mounted devices, while the Neonode reference was about phones. The appeals judges disagreed, writing that one would &quot;naturally turn to references like Plaisant to find solutions.&quot; They invalidated the patent as obvious.<br />
<br />
Finally, the judges considered the '172 patent on Apple's &quot;autocorrect&quot; feature. That was held invalid in light of prior art, too. Apple lawyers didn't claim their client invented auto-correction entirely, but they alleged that Samsung had copied Apple's method of doing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prior to the copying, the Samsung phones automatically corrected the typed text as the user typed,&quot; noted the appeals judges. &quot;On the iPhone, the correction was made only after the user 'accepts or hits space.'&quot; However, in the judges' view that exact feature had been disclosed in an earlier patent numbered 7,880,730.<br />
<br />
Samsung had counter-sued with two of its own patents. Apple was found to have infringed one of them, the '449 patent related to camera systems and image compression. That win was upheld, along with the jury's verdict that Samsung should get $158,400.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are delighted with the resounding victory from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which found that two of Apple’s patents should never have been issued,&quot; a Samsung spokesperson said in a statement. &quot;Today’s decision is a win for consumer choice and puts competition back where it belongs – in the marketplace, not in the courtroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
The decision doesn't affect the results of the first trial. Samsung was finally forced to pay Apple $548 million after losing that one on appeal. That case is headed towards a third jury trial to re-consider certain damages issues.<br />
<br />
The $120 million verdict was awarded by a jury in 2014 at the conclusion of a second trial over allegations of patent infringement in newer Samsung phones. While a $120 million verdict cannot be called small, the amount was about five percent of the $2.2 billion award that Apple lawyers asked for.<br />
<br />
The second trial also resulted in an injunction against some older Samsung phones, which just went into effect eight days ago. Since there's no longer any patent infringement, today's opinion will presumably remove the injunction. The appeals court explained its seeming reversal by noting that its decision on the injunction issue &quot;assumed infringement&quot; and &quot;did not address or resolve the merits of the underlying case that is now before us.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Is there a name for the way Grace Kelly's dress is cut in this image? It is kind of like a chevron design but made out of how the material is wrapped rather than through colors. It looks very clean IMO. I don't think I have ever seen a dress cut that way at the top in any of the old movies I have watched. It looks fucking gangster. I would wear the fuck out of a suit or shirt inspired that design. It would look incredibly sinister paired with the right shoes/accessories set off with some silver, ruby, black diamond, or emerald cuff links. <br />
<br />
A modern dress made out vagrant black material with a uniform sheer instead of the floral pattern would look fucking sick. A cool thing about it would be the ability to selectively make parts of the dress see through, the bodice would not be see through by layering the material and the arms could be for instance.<br />
