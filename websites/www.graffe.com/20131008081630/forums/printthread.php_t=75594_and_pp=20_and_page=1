Ok. Once again, the old fucks do not understand what's coming, and how absolutely obsolete they are.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a hint to anyone who thinks millenials are self absorbed:<br />
<br />
The coddled generation is you, fuckers. Specifically the &quot;Bosses&quot; so the Baby Boomers. You got coddled into thinking hard work fucking mattered. Hard work is for fuckups who can't produce results. Results matter. You, as a generation, don't produce results. I know this from <b>every single job I have worked</b> and a general glance at the <b>utterly reeling economy you left my generation</b>. Maybe 100 of you, total, have done something mildly memorable. My generation has to look back to BEFORE YOU ASSHOLES BECAME IMPORTANT to see anything worth emulating. Your greatest contribution to American culture was nationwide mass drug addiction and injecting it into hollywood culture so hard that it became acceptable to actively defend as normal. Good fucking job you goddamn hippies! <br />
<br />
Your generation is too incompetent to use a computer and therefore is incapable of actually producing anything relevant to the world economy. I do, personally, more work than four of you combined, with automated scripts. So do all of my peers. I don't even need a robot to do your job, a quad core will suffice. They're like $100. You get paid what, 150k? Man, no wonder the last 10 years have been layoff heavy. You're fucking useless ass can't even outperform a chip I can mass produce. The soulless bureaucracy built to grind a human into machinery has been replaced by actual machinery. We're not stupid enough to fall behaving in a way that puts us in a job that won't exist in three years.<br />
<br />
You bitch about parents calling the workplace? OUR PARENTS ARE YOU, THESE PEOPLE ARE YOUR GENERATION! THIS IS SOMEHOW OUR FAULT AS A GENERATION? Thankfully, my parents aren't morons and don't do this but don't try to pin this shit on my age group, this is all more of the baby boomer generation being the most inadequately pathetic group of vaginal discharge in modern history. The kid is not the problem in helicopter-parent-land. It's the helicopter parent. You go talk to your own father and make him behave. See how that works. I have no fucking method of leashing my elders.<br />
<br />
Also, what the fuck is with hiring consultants to &quot;Understand millenials&quot;. How about you fucking learn something yourself you generation of quote referencing unenlightened assholes. We're happy to talk with you. You'll probably learn something, you uneducated scrub. It's not fucking hard to keep us engaged: don't treat us like you're an angry parent, and we will continue to outperform the rest of your workforce while half-awake and yawning. We sound self important because when it comes to meeting time and we're talking about shit we got done this week, our list is three times as long as yours and any one item is probably more complicated than your entire week's worth of work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Moral of story: Old fucks are ignorant, and obsolete. You have no place in the competitive workforce, and the best you can hope for is that we don't dump social security as soon as we get enough members of congress from our age group because we sure as fuck don't feel like we need it and you've been calling us names our entire adult lives. Enjoy your retirement - it'll be as sweet for us as it was when we punched the schoolyard bully in the goddamn nose for the first time. We'll make it as painful as bloody possible.<br />
<br />
I'm not self absorbed. I'm fucking horrified by the slime that my progenitors are and genuinely think you are all inferior. Guess what? I keep proving my opinion right. And in the end, the world doesn't give a shit about your age, your work ethic, or anything else. It just cares about your capability.</blockquote>

</div>Management Consultants and the like are largely jobs for rich kids who graduated from elite institutions and chose to pursue business rather than hard science or a professional degree.<br />
<br />
1.  Politics:  To tell the company to do what you already wanted to do but didn't have the political capital to accomplish.  (Recommendations are redundant)<br />
<br />
2.  Genuine research:  Temporarily shake-up intra-organizational communication to see what important knowledge has been hiding in plain sight.  (Recommendations are ignored but the knowledge is used to make other decisions)<br />
<br />
3.  Actual Consulting:  Sometimes a large company winds up faced with a dilemma they aren't prepared for and ridiculous consulting fees are better than a costly blunder.  (Recommendations are strongly considered)<br />
<br />
4.  Some executive or another has actually drunk too much kool-aid or jumped on a bandwagon of some sort.  (Certain recommendations are followed blindly, especially the ones involving the consultant's fees, the rest are ignored by anyone with kool-aid resistance)<br />
<br />
5.  Blatant nepotism or something similar.  (Recommendations are irrelevant)</blockquote>

I'll grant you up front that Scott probably suffers from a mixture of ennui and myopia and absolutely no chance of STDs, who apparently feels neither shame in nor fear about sabotaging his job prospects by appearing in these photographs, to the fury of every other American who sees them:<br />
<br />
[scott in his house.jpg]<br />
[scott checking his dry cleaning.jpg]<br />
[scott enjoying a nice iced tea on his day off.jpg]<br />
<br />
This is a guy whose entire job search is conducted online in the mornings.  Anybody want to hire this go-getter? <br />
<br />
But for me, you have to start at what's known to be a fact: this is the New York Times. <br />
You almost have to wonder why they would photograph him in this way if they weren't trying to sabotage him, trying to make him look like a privileged (white) out of touch jerk, just to bring out the populist backlinks.  This is the NYT after all, where playing to the lowest common populist denominator is the next best thing to running a Page 3 Girls.  &quot;Do you mind pouring a Gatorade?  We're trying to show how the millennials won't let their unemployment stand in the way of their thirst.  Sigh, iced tea will do.&quot;<br />
 <br />
So I'll grant you that Scott is responsible for his own plight in the way that everyone carries the burden of their own choices, but Scott wasn't born in a vacuum, he was born to parents, parents who think this:<br />

&quot;I can't tell if you're defending hipsters or hating on them.&quot;   They're ridiculous. Feel better?  They're not the problem.<br />
<br />
It's a simple thesis and no one wants to hear it: hipsters may lack drive, but the world they live in wasn't set up by them, it was set up by their parents, i.e. the Dumbest Generation Of Narcissists In The History Of The World, the ones who magnified the importance and cost of college without having any idea of what should be its purpose, let alone its content. <br />
<br />
If you want to tell me a 30 year old hipster should be lashed for not trying to better himself, I'll bring the whip, but the 30 year old chose his pointless major when he was 17 and you think the outcome is all his fault?

The typical justification for the humanities is that they foster critical thinking, awareness, a historical context, etc.  Which are true, I guess.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The trouble with this stance, and my own in a previous post about more people going into the humanities since the Crash, is that we have no real firm definition of humanities. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Hence the problem with the debate: its missing the distinction between intellectual pursuits and easy majors. Articles like those in Inside Higher Ed are really focused on the value of rigorous humanities students (in good schools) i.e. the former; articles decrying grade inflation and the general unemployment among the liberal arts grads are talking about the latter.

That said I am 52, and while I don't consider myself that old (contrary to Bae's views) I am a productive fuck as well, and am told that all the time by pretty much everyone I work with.  So maybe SOME old fucks need to realize not all.  Generalization is bad.</div>

	</div>
</div>What's she majoring/majored in? Because if it ain't a technical field, she's going to end up like those two consultants on the show - making money doing NOTHING PRODUCTIVE just so old people can feel better.<br />

</div>Yup, and we're here to use our fancy technology to ruin your economy.<br />

I don't know what us young people will do to the economy. I do know that we can't fuck it up much harder than the old farts did though so I'm feeling pretty fantastically safe in my smug, smart-ass attitude.</blockquote>

</div>Absogoddamnlutely. Fair is fair. If my post makes old people rage - that is EXACTLY how it feels to have time call you the &quot;ME ME ME&quot; generation, or have fucking 60 minutes do a piece on your peers as if you're an animal to be viewed on a zoo, while all the while you're doing more work for less pay than any of the assholes doing the name calling.</blockquote>

</div>Hah. I love it. <br />
<br />
Surprisingly enough -- this attitude of &quot;we are the moar betterer&quot; is fairly rampant in the blue-collar world as well. I see 20 and 30 somethings pushing the boundaries of extra smoke breaks and free lunch on the clock more than I see 40 and 50 year olds doing it. I wonder why that is?<br />
