<br><br>This file is designed to allow individual users to define their own custom css for EZboards.  But, it can be used to define custom css for other situations as well.
<br><br>To start using this script yourself, take these steps.
<br><br>1. This script was written in php, so you will need to download the source code file, and copy the file onto a server that has php support.
<br><br>2. In your EZboard options, under Custom HTML, uncheck Default CSS and then put this code into the header (be sure to change www.tindilosi.com to your servername, and the directory where you have saved the php script file):
<br><br><code>&lt;LINK type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="http://www.tindilosi.com/code/dyncss/dyncss.php?css=board"&gt;</code>
<br><br>3. Create your css theme files, you will need to make one for each theme that you want to use, you should put them in the same directory as the php script file, or remember the path for step 4.
<br><br>4. Edit the php script file, you can change or add variables to create themes that users can select from.
<br><br>If you want to add a new theme called Pink, and the css file for the theme is named pinktheme.css, then add a line in the php script that looks like this:
<br><br><code>$themes["pink"]["board"] = "pinktheme.css";</code>
<br><br>To delete that theme, just remove the line.
<br><br>If you define a theme named default, it will be used when people have not yet chosen a theme and don't have a cookie set, just add a line like...
<br><br><code>$themes["default"]["board"] = "pinktheme.css";</code>
<br><br>To set the default theme (the theme that will be used if a user tries to use an invalid theme or css) to use a css file named default.css, you can change the following variable like this: 
<br><br><code>$default = "default.css";</code>
<br><br>You can also change the cookie life, if you don't know what this is, just leave it alone.
<br><br>5. For advanced users, you can choose to define different sets of css files that all use the same theme.  This can be useful if you want to have a website where the color scheme matches your EZboard, but they don't use the exact same css file.
<br><br>Using two css files that use a Green theme, with names like green_site.css and green_ezboard.css, you would add these two lines to the script file:
<br><br><code>$themes["green"]["board"] = "green_ezboard.css";</code>
<br><code>$themes["green"]["site"] = "green_site.css";</code>
<br><br>Then depending on which css file you want to use, you would need to change the link in step 2 to end with either:
<br><br><code>?css=board</code>
<br><br>or
<br><br><code>?css=site</code>
