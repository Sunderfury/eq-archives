			<title>A question for iPad users - iPad2 Music defaults to Radio</title>

			<description>My job gave me an old iPad2 in case we have to facetime for work reasons across disparate sites. 
 
Ostensibly. 
 
Noone uses it for that purpose. 
 
So we basically have free iPads that are contigent on our employment. 
 
Yay! Fantastic device, really.</description>

<br />

<br />
I bought a bluetooth keyboard for it (that stopped working suddenly, but I haven't bothered to troubleshoot it, it's probably an ios update, but not important)<br />
<br />
My *ONLY* complaint about this thing is that, even if I leave the iPad Music program launched (the one down in the bar (messages, mail, safari, music)) and it was last focused on artists or album, it ALWAYS REVERTS STRAIGHT TO &quot;RADIO&quot;.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I like the option of radio, but is there ANY way to make it, WHILE STILL OPEN IF I DOUBLE TAP THE HOME BUTTON to just launch and STAY on the same selection I had made, instead of launching it and then pausing briefly (a second or two) and loading the &quot;radio&quot; tab?<br />
<br />
I tried searching, but I don't know the lingo as well as I know windows wording.</div>

Closing a program takes you to a tile menu. Who the fuck thoguht this was a great idea? If I wanted my desktop to be a tablet, I would have bought a tablet. <br />

Windows 8 is absolute garbage. <br />
<br />
The last version of windows that was decent was 7, and the last version that was actually a success was XP. <br />
<br />
The idiots developing these OSes need to stop fucking up.</div>

<br />
Will you be upgrading ? I'll be upgrading my own and my son's PC for sure. Not too sure about my wife's PC, since it's a bit older (still runs Win7), and has a LOT of photoshop/illustrator stuff installed.<br />
Not sure I want to mess with that in case it's not fully compatible...</div>

			<title>Why do we have GiB and MiB for data storage?</title>

			<description>This is something that has never really made sense to me.  GB and MB are the exact same thing and denote the same storage.  So is there a real purpose for them or is MiB and GiB just engineers stroking their egos and abandoning the commonly used term.</description>
