<br />
Because of political bullshit, involving high officials and fears over doctors and the NHS, the prosecution deliberately buggered the trial!<br />
<br />
bit too much to post it all, but you can read it on the Wiki. <i>Un-bloody-believable!!! </i>:angry:<br />

FFS...if that bastard had been nailed, Shipman might have been stopped/caught earlier.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I worry about what it'll be like going from a big fish in a small pond to a fish in a large pond. I'm pretty..umm...eccentric when it comes to my assignments (either out of boredom or attention and desire)...I wonder if there's any place for that at a decent university, and if I'll even inadvertently become <b>more</b> over the top in order to grab the attention I need to succeed and get what I desire.  I pull some pretty questionable things my graduate friends think I'm crazy for in terms of taste...but they end up really getting results and become good pieces of work. <br />
<br />
At any rate, I'm worried about - now - ~seriously~ risking my academic career by being provocative, barbaric, and eccentric. My work so far I'm pretty satisfied with as long as I've stayed interested in it, but I have the feeling that the new environment will make me seem more dangerous than promising. <br />
<br />
So: Fight back? Continue? change? I'm not sure. How dangerous is the ground I walk on?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Alpha this time was relatively short, and capped out at level 75. I was busy with family and work, so I mostly hung out in Howling Fjord, although I did pop over to Vengeance Landing.<br />
<br />
I started alpha on Tuesday, May 20, which was several weeks after all the leak sites were <i>sure</i> alpha had started -- FYI for next time.<br />
<br />
Despite having logged off in Quel'Danas, I found Ringo (now "Whizbang") located in Shattrath City. Near the center of town, the Alliance Herald was standing beside portals to Valiance Keep (Howling Fjord) and Vengeance Landing (Borean Tundra) with a quest to go "Onwards to Northrend!" Ringo needed 1,256,500 experience to reach level 71.<br />
<br />
I sent my level 65 mage to Theramore. (We were advised that the content was for characters level 67 and up, but I was curious to see if there were any new alchemy recipes he could learn at this point, or teleport spells.) The ship from Theramore to Borean Tundra did not appear to be in and working at this point.<br />
<br />
Upon talking to my first quest NPC, Ringo became neutral with Valiance Expedition. What's most interesting about this faction is the flavor text: "The main armies of the Alliance in Northrend, moving against the Scourge and unified under King Varian Wrynn's command." It seems the Missing Diplomat quest line will be coming to an end at last.<br />
<br />
Highlord Tirion Fordring spends a lot of his time in Valgarde yelling threats at Arthas. Oh, and he's got the Ashbringer, after the conclusion of a short quest in the lower (non-instanced) level of Utgaard Keep. Pretty neat.<br />
<br />
Trainers for all professions were in Valgarde, at the Grand Master level, which raises the cap on a skill to 450. (Not all professions had their higher ranks available initially, including engineering and cooking. Mining could have its cap raised, but there was no way to learn how to smelt cobalt, the first new type of ore in Northrend.)<br />
<br />
Bears, including my polar bear pet, now close their mouths except when roaring or biting.<br />
<br />
Next time up, I took a break to create a dwarven deathknight, Grimbooze. Without the deathknight starting area in yet, he started by Tirion Fordring in the Eastern Plaguelands. Oddly, the riverbed next to him was totally dry.<br />
<br />
Running to Light's Hope Chapel, I found there to be a death knight trainer there, Souxsie the Banshee. Talking with her revealed no spells I could learn yet, but did make me friendly with the Knights of the Ebon Blade: "Freed from the grasp of the Lich King, his former Deathknights have regrouped against him under the banner of Highlord Darion Morgraine."<br />
<br />
There's a ton of UI improvements, from how fast the sparklies travel around the "always on" hunter pet abilities to tweaks to some spell effects and so on. The game is also done at a noticeably higher detail level -- if you noticed that murloc costumes seemed to be a lot more detailed than other stuff, that was a precursor to the same level of detail in Northrend.<br />
<br />
I don't really have a good write-up ready this time around, so ask whatever, although I didn't see as much of the game as some (only got halfway through 70, because this is my busy season), but I did check out both newbie zones in Northrend and ran all over Howling Fjord especially.</div>

<br />
 The pope made his first major appearance on his Australia tour Thursday before an estimated crowd of 150,000 people at World Youth Day.<br />
<br />
The event is believed to be the world's largest Christian gathering and dubbed &quot;the Catholic Woodstock.&quot;<br />
<br />
He delivered his homily in several languages to people representing 70 countries, lamenting &quot;erosion, deforestation, the squandering of the world's mineral and ocean resources in order to fuel an insatiable consumption.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of you come from island nations whose very existence is threatened by rising water levels, others from nations suffering the effects of devastating drought. God's wondrous creation is sometimes experienced as almost hostile to its stewards, even something dangerous. How can what is 'good' appear so threatening?&quot;<br />
<br />
Earlier, the pope held a private early-morning mass at St. Mary's Cathedral and toured Sydney Harbour on the city's most luxurious cruise ship. <br />
<br />
He was greeted at World Youth Day by a traditional aboriginal welcoming ceremony. In his address, the pope thanked aboriginal elders and noted the decades of hardship native people faced throughout Australia's history.<br />
<br />
 &quot;I am deeply moved to stand on your land, knowing the suffering and injustices it has borne but aware too of the healing and hope that are now at work, rightly bringing pride to all Australian citizens,&quot; the pope said. &quot;To the young indigenous -- aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders -- and the Tokelauans, I express my thanks for your stirring welcome.&quot;<br />
advertisement<br />
<br />
At a meeting with top government officials, including Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the pope praised his official apology in February on behalf of the nation to its aboriginal people.<br />
<br />
Thursday's events were the pope's first public appearances since arriving in Australia on Sunday and spending several days resting.</div>

<br />
What is particularly infuriating to me is the self-blinded gall of a man who is just disembarking from a completely elective journey the last leg of which was spent running a half-dozen jet engines for over 20 hours just to ferry his wrinkly old white ass to be personally worshiped and/or protested in Sydney turning around and lecturing US on &quot;insatiable consumption.&quot;  A man who sits on a gold throne and wears ermine stoles and gigantic ruby rings and eats off of gold dinnerware crafted hundreds of years ago by the finest goldsmiths ever to live in Europe, he is lecturing US on &quot;insatiable consumption.&quot;  :rolleyes:</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I need some advice/help/opinions. <br />
<br />
A friend of mine decided to stop playing WoW nearly a year ago but had a large amount of time pre-paid. Instead of letting that time essentially go to waste he passed the account to me and said feel free. I really had no intentions of playing anything past twink bgs, but of course after a couple of months I decided to bring a character to 70... and then another one. <br />
<br />
Now my friend is back and has decided to pick up his account. Problem is he has a ton of high level characters on that account so offering to pay for a new one for him is out of the question. <br />
<br />
I have read that Blizzard does not support character transfers and anything among that nature going against the terms of use. However, they still offer a paid character transfer to a new account, so what gives?<br />
<br />
Now I realize that WotLK will trivialize everything that I have done up to this point, but I enjoy playing and really do not want to completely start over.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any advice on this? My friend is willing to set up another account in his name for me, but it would not be worth it if he has to pay for the monthly in his name.</div>

It was looking like a pretty good patch, but they apparently nerfed the hell out of melee weapons. One-handed weapons now all have a delay of 2 seconds and two-handed weapons have a delay of 1.59 seconds. Yes, that means two-handed weapons swing faster than one-handed weapons. I guess they upped the per-swing damage to compensate, but it now takes longer to do combos.<br />
<br />
This was to fix a bug where female characters animated slower than male characters. So they nerfed everyone to be even slower than female characters were.<br />
<br />
This is probably the most brain-dead nerf I've ever seen in a game.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I ran across this thread just now, while I was looking up a name of an old member, and trying to decide if I knew them or not.  But that's beside the point.  I was just curious to know if this kind of thread would be acceptable today or not.<br />
<br />
I understand its been five years since this was originally posted, and times have changed even in that short of a time span, but I'm still trying to pin down what most feel is acceptable here.<br />
<br />
My opinion is this would be okay to post now.  Certainly the things that this thread talks about were discussed in a very tame manner by comparison to several posts I've read over the past six months, but is that the consensus?<br />
<br />
I would have just posted my question in the thread, but because it was locked, that wasn't possible.<br />
