			SAWYER:A couple of other questions about the agenda now.  You have said next year that you would repeal the healthcare vote.  That's still your mission?<br />
<br />
BOEHNER:<br />
Well, I think the election changes that.  It's pretty clear that the president was reelected, <b><u>Obamacare is the law of the land</u></b>.  I think there are parts of the healthcare law that are gonna be very difficult to implement.  And very expensive.  And as the time when we're tryin' to find a way to create a path toward a balanced budget everything has to be on the table.<br />
<br />
SAWYER:<br />
But you won't be spending the time next year trying to repeal Obamacare?<br />
<br />
BOEHNER:<br />
There certainly may be parts of it that we believe-- need to be changed.  We may do that.  No decisions at this point.

</div>Of course, a staffer of his felt it necessary to clarify his remarks.  His remarks seemed pretty clear to me especially now that the election is over.<br />

Virginia's 13 electoral votes went to President Obama for the second straight election, and the proprietor of a store in the south central city of Bedford is not hiding his dismay.<br />
Lyons Jewelers hung up multiple signs on the windows of the shop indicating the shop would not be open for business Wednesday, including one saying the store was closed to &quot;mourn the loss of the America that our forefathers endowed to us,&quot; WDBJ reported.<br />
&quot;Lyons will reopen tomorrow to continue the fight against a president who seeks my demise&quot; and &quot;Shame on VA &amp; USA&quot; read two other signs.<br />
Another played off a remark Mr. Obama made while campaigning in Roanoke earlier this year about businesses and government assistance that Republicans latched onto as a campaign theme: &quot;I know I didn't build this — God did.&quot;<br />
One customer did hang up a sign as a response of sorts: &quot;I am sorry you feel this way!!! I do bussiness (sic) I guess I will take it somewhere else!!&quot;<br />
With nearly 100 percent of precincts reporting, Republican Mitt Romney won Bedford City, 54 percent to 44 percent, as well as Bedford County, 71 percent to 27 percent. Mr. Obama carried the state with 50.7 percent of the vote to Mr. Romney's 47.7 percent, according to unofficial results — a difference of about 110,000 votes out of approximately 3.7 million cast.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Alright, so I am replacing my iPhone 4S with the Nexus 4 as soon as I get some things figured out about the platform compared to iOS.  My main (only really) is how are you handling text messages? Do you have an unlimited text plan or is there something similar to iMessage on Android that will reduce the amount of texts sent charged against the account?  Most people I know use iOS still, so usually text messages are sent over iMessage instead whenever possible, which is the majority of the time for myself.  If there is not something comparable I would have to change my cell phone plan which in turn would have some ancillary impacts that I would like to avoid.  I am guessing that you all are using Google Voice in some capacity for text messages.<br />
<br />
Also, what are some so called killer apps for Android that are useful or fun? There are a number of Google services that fit that bill, but what about non-Google apps that are worth looking at?</div>

		<hr />
		
			The first and only preventative HIV vaccine based on a genetically modified killed whole-virus has been making steady progress in Phase I Clinical Trials in the United States and the interim results are being analyzed in preparation for the next steps.<br />
<br />
Developed by Dr. Chil-Yong Kang and his team at Western’s Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry, with the support of Sumagen Canada, the vaccine (SAV001-H) holds tremendous promise for success in the final phases of clinical testing now that the first hurdle has been accomplished. It is the only HIV vaccine currently under development in Canada, and one of only a few in the world.<br />
<br />
The first human applied clinical study (SAV CT 01) using a genetically modified killed whole-virus vaccine (SAV001-H) to evaluate its safety and tolerability was initiated in March 2012. This study is a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study of killed whole HIV-1 vaccine (SAV001-H) following intramuscular (IM) administration. Infected men and women, 18-50 years of age, have been enrolled in this study and randomized into two treatment groups to administer killed whole HIV-1 vaccine (SAV001-H) or placebo.<br />
<br />
Sumagen announced today the patient enrollment has progressed smoothly and there have been no adverse effects observed including local reactions, signs/symptoms and laboratory toxicities after SAV001-H injection in all enrolled patients to date. With these interim results, the SAV001-H has proven safety and tolerability in humans and given Sumagen confidence for the next clinical trials to prove its immunogenicity and efficacy evaluation.<br />
<br />
In addition, the humoral immune responses, such as HIV-1 antibody formation against SAV001-H, are currently being analyzed. The interim data showed significant increase in the HIV-1 antibody formations after SAV001-H administration compared to the base line in some patients. Even though this study is a blinded study until completion, these results are encouraging for the possibility of the prophylactic potency of SAV001-H.<br />
<br />
With these interim results, Sumagen is confident of the safety of SAV001-H and the potency of inducing immune responses in human trials.<br />
<br />
“We have proven that there is no safety concern of SAV001-H in human administration and we are now prepared to take the next steps towards Phase II and Phase III clinical trials,” said Dr. Dong Joon Kim, a spokesperson for Sumagen Co. Ltd. “We are delighted to be one step closer to the first commercialized HIV vaccine.”<br />
<br />
In future, the company will be looking for collaboration with multi-national biopharmaceutical companies for globalizing clinical trials and commercialization.<br />
<br />
This Phase I clinical trial (SAV CT 01) was partially funded by Industrial Research Assistant Program of National Research Council Canada since January 2012.<br />
<br />
HIV/AIDS has killed more than 28 million people worldwide, and more than 34 million people currently live with the virus infection. Since the virus was characterized in 1983, there have been numerous trials through pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions around the world to develop vaccines; however, no vaccine has been commercialized to date.<br />
<br />
Other HIV vaccines evaluated through human clinical trials have focused on either one specific component of HIV as an antigen, genetic vaccine using recombinant DNA, or recombinant viruses carrying the HIV genes.<br />
<br />
Kang’s vaccine is unique in that it uses a killed whole HIV-1, much like the killed whole virus vaccines for polio, influenza, rabies and hepatitis A. The HIV-1 is genetically engineered so it is non-pathogenic and can be produced in large quantities.<br />
<br />
Through WORLDiscoveries, Western’s technology transfer office, Sumagen Canada has secured patents for the SAV001 vaccine in more than 70 countries, including the U.S., the European Union, China, India and South Korea. The vaccine has been manufactured at a bio-safety level 3 (BSL3) good manufacturing practice (GMP) facility in the United States.<br />
<br />
Located in The Stiller Centre for Technology Commercialization in Western’s Research Park in London, Ontario, Sumagen Canada was established in 2008 specifically to manage and support clinical development of Kang’s vaccine.
