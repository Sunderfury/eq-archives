A Tidal rep is calling these departures “streamlining” and “redundancies,” which are nice fancy words for everything going to hell. Via Business Insider, we’ve got the official <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tidal-ceo-andy-chen-leaves-aspiro-jay-z-streaming-site-2015-4#ixzz3Xb352UL9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">company statement</a>: <br />

			TIDAL’s new interum [sic] CEO is Peter Tonstad – a former CEO of parent company Aspiro Group. He has a better understanding of the industry and a clear vision for how the company is looking to change the status quo. He’s streamlining resources to ensure talent is maximized to enhance the customer experience. We’ve eliminated a handful of positions and refocused our company-wide talent to address departments that need support and cut redundancies. TIDAL’s offices globally will remain and grow: we are already hirinig for several new positions now. We’re excited about our future and what’s in-store for fans who want the best listening experience.

		<hr />
		
			Oklahoma became the first US state to approve nitrogen gas for executions under a measure Governor Mary Fallin signed into law Friday that provides an alternative death penalty method if lethal injections aren’t possible, either because of a court ruling or a drug shortage.<br />
<br />
Executions are on hold in Oklahoma while the US supreme court considers whether the state’s current three-drug method of lethal injection is constitutional. Supporters of the new law maintain nitrogen-induced hypoxia is a humane and painless method of execution that requires no medical expertise to perform.<br />
<br />
“Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous,” Fallin said in a statement announcing that she had signed the bill into law.<br />
<br />
“I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard.”<br />
<br />
The bill authored by Republican representative Mike Christian and Republican senator Anthony Sykes had passed the state House on an 85-10 vote and cleared the Senate on a 41-0 vote.<br />
<br />
There are no reports of nitrogen gas ever being used to execute humans, and critics say that one concern is that the method is untested. Some states even ban its use to put animals to sleep.<br />
<br />
But supporters of Oklahoma’s plan argue that nitrogen-induced hypoxia – or a lack of oxygen in the blood – is a humane execution method.<br />
<br />
“The process is fast and painless,” said Christian, a former Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper who wrote the bill. “It’s foolproof.”<br />
<br />
Opponents say there’s no way to know whether the method is painless and effective.<br />
<br />
“It just hasn’t been tried, so we don’t know,” said Represenative Emily Virgin, a Democrat from Norman who opposes the death penalty.<br />
<br />
The changes come after a botched execution last year in which Oklahoma was using a new sedative as the first in a three-drug combination. State officials tried to halt the lethal injection after the inmate writhed on the gurney and moaned. He died 43 minutes after the process began.<br />
<br />
The problematic execution was blamed on a poorly placed intravenous line and prompted a lawsuit from Oklahoma death-row inmates, who argue that the state’s new drug combination presents a serious risk of pain and suffering. The US supreme court is scheduled to hear arguments later this month.<br />
<br />
Under the new law, lethal injection would remain the state’s first choice for executions and nitrogen gas would be its first backup method – ahead of the electric chair, which the state hasn’t used since 1966, and a firing squad, which has never been used in Oklahoma.

			TUCSON – A man who deputies say tried to kill his wife may have power over her life support.<br />
<br />
On Sunday, George Majewski, 62, called 911 saying he just strangled his wife, and she was poisoning his daughter and him, according to a search warrant. It was at a home on Como Drive near Tangerine Road and La Cholla Boulevard.<br />
<br />
The wife is a veterinarian, Kerman Dubash. She appeared lifeless when deputies arrived. She was taken to the hospital and placed on life support. That status was unchanged Thursday, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department.<br />
<br />
Michelle Scopellite is a partner at Goldstein and Scopellite Attorneys at Law. She specializes in family cases. Scopellite said spouses almost always have power of attorney to make medical decisions when the other spouse is not capable.<br />
<br />
“You can fight it, but unless the probate court sees a cause to remove that power of attorney from a spouse, it's probably not going to happen,” she said.<br />
<br />
Without a living will stating otherwise, spouses have the primary power of attorney when somebody cannot make their own medical decisions. Children, domestic partners, parents then siblings are the next people to have the power when there is no spouse, according to Scopellite.<br />
<br />
Scopellite said legal battles can take months, but case law shows family members have a hard time taking the authority. Exceptions might be made in special cases.<br />
<br />
“If the court stated that there was attempted murder or made some finding along a criminal violation, then that would give the family members more power to take power of attorney away from that person,” Scopellite said.<br />
<br />
Ed Mercurio-Sakwa is the CEO of Emerge Center Against Domestic Abuse. He said violence is always about control, regardless of social status.<br />
<br />
“It has no impact as to whether they have money or not, whether they're educated or not,” Mercurio-Sakwa said. “And so that's often the problem we struggle with, is people want to stereotype it.”<br />
<br />
Emerge has a 24-hour crisis line with specialists who can guide victims to solutions.<br />
<br />
“Reaching out and talking to the professionals on that hotline will allow them to figure out what's going to be safest in that particular situation,” Mercurio-Sakwa said. “Because every situation is different.”<br />
<br />
In 2010, Majewski lost his veterinary license, according to records from the Arizona State Veterinary Medical Examining Board.<br />
<br />
When patients complained about his services to the board, he threatened those patients. When the board imposed discipline, he threatened board members, according to the veterinary board records.<br />
<br />
A psychiatrist testified he is an immigrant from Poland. He was persecuted by the communist government. He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar affective disorder, according to the veterinary board records.

			 DALLAS (AP) — A woman who operated a church at her suburban Dallas home has been arrested for allegedly helping starve a 2-year-old boy to rid him of a &quot;demon,&quot; then holding a resurrection ceremony shortly after he died to try to revive him, investigators said Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Police believe the boy was dead during the ceremony but that his parents took his body to their native Mexico for burial without reporting the death, said Balch Springs police Lt. Mark Maret. He said an anonymous tip about the ceremony at Araceli Meza's home, where several other church members also lived, led to the investigation. He noted that more arrests are likely.<br />
<br />
Meza was charged Monday with injury to a child causing serious bodily injury by omission. The 49-year-old was being held on $100,000 bond at the local jail, where records didn't list an attorney. No one answered the door Tuesday at her home in Balch Springs, about 15 miles east of Dallas, and phone calls to the home went unanswered.<br />
<br />
Witnesses told police that Meza and the boy's parents believed he had a &quot;demon&quot; inside him, and that fasting was the way to save him.<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn't give the child any food for about 25 days,&quot; Maret said. &quot;They just gave him some water, which ultimately caused the child to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Church member Nazareth Zurita said she saw the child &quot;looking frail and weak&quot; the day before the resurrection ceremony, according to a police affidavit. She said the toddler fell and hit his head several times, but she hesitated to help him &quot;due to his demon possession.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zurita said the next time she saw the child was the next day being held by church leader Daniel Meza, who was trying to revive the boy through a miracle during the ritual. Zurita said &quot;it took her a while to figure out&quot; the child was dead, according to the affidavit.<br />
<br />
Investigators believe the boy died on March 21 or early the next day, and that the ceremony was held March 22 at Meza's home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently... they had a ceremony called 'the rising,' trying to resurrect the child back to life,&quot; Maret said.<br />
<br />
Police went to the home to check on the boy, whose name was not released, and discovered his parents had returned to Mexico.<br />
<br />
Another church member, Delia Guadalupe Oyervides Herrera, told police she tried several times to feed the child during the 25-day fast, &quot;but was scolded by the pastors of the church,&quot; according to the affidavit. She asked the child's mother why she would allow her child to be starved and was &quot;advised that it was God's will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meza wasn't affiliated with any traditional religion but held regular services at her home with her husband, Maret said.<br />
<br />
Zurita said Meza &quot;was considered a prophet&quot; who &quot;would advise to the other members of the church what God has spoken to her.&quot; Zurita identified herself as the secretary and third-ranking officer of the Iglesia Internacional Jesus es el Rey, and said Meza's husband was the church's leader and Meza was its second-ranking officer.<br />
<br />
Julia Contreras lives three doors down from the residential church. She said the street was full of cars every Sunday.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be packed with cars every Wednesday, sometimes Saturday and mainly on Sunday,&quot; she said. Cars would be parked in the front yard of the vacant house next to the Mezas' house and on a grassy slope on an adjoining street, she said.

			VATICAN CITY &#8211;  Pope Francis on Sunday marked the 100th anniversary of the slaughter of Armenians by calling the massacre by Ottoman Turks &quot;the first genocide of the 20th century&quot; and urging the international community to recognize it as such. Turkey immediately responded by recalling its ambassador and accusing Francis of spreading hatred and &quot;unfounded claims.&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis issued the pronouncement during a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica commemorating the centenary that was attended by Armenian church leaders and President Serge Sarkisian, who praised the pope for calling a spade a spade and &quot;delivering a powerful message to the international community.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The words of the leader of a church with 1 billion followers cannot but have a strong impact,&quot; he told The Associated Press.<br />
<br />
Historians estimate that up to 1.5 million Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks around the time of World War I, an event widely viewed by scholars as the first genocide of the 20th century.<br />
<br />
Turkey, however, denies a genocide took place. It has insisted that the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest.<br />
<br />
Francis defended his words by saying it was his duty to honor the memory of the innocent men, women and children who were &quot;senselessly&quot; murdered by Ottoman Turks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
He said similar massacres are under way today against Christians who because of their faith are &quot;publicly and ruthlessly put to death &#8212; decapitated, crucified, burned alive &#8212; or forced to leave their homeland,&quot; a reference to the Islamic State group's assault against Christians in Iraq and Syria.<br />
<br />
Francis called on the world community, heads of state and international organizations to recognize the truth of what transpired to prevent such &quot;horrors&quot; from repeating themselves, and to oppose all such crimes &quot;without ceding to ambiguity or compromise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turkey has fiercely lobbied to prevent countries, including the Holy See, from officially recognizing the Armenian massacre as genocide and reacted strongly to Francis' declaration.<br />
<br />
&quot;The pope's statement, which is far from historic and legal truths, is unacceptable,&quot; Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted. &quot;Religious positions are not places where unfounded claims are made and hatred is stirred.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Foreign Ministry summoned the Vatican's envoy in Ankara, and then announced it was recalling its own ambassador to the Vatican for consultations.<br />
<br />
In a statement, the ministry said the Turkish people would not recognize the pope's statement &quot;which is controversial in every aspect, which is based on prejudice, which distorts history and reduces the pains suffered in Anatolia under the conditions of the First World War to members of just one religion.&quot;<br />
<br />
It accused Francis of deviating from his message of peace and reconciliation during his November visit to Turkey.<br />
<br />
Several European countries recognize the massacres as genocide, though Italy and the United States, for example, have avoided using the term officially given the importance they place on Turkey as an ally.<br />
<br />
The Holy See, too, places great importance in its relationship with the moderate Muslim nation, especially as it demands that Muslim leaders condemn the Islamic State group slaughter of Christians.<br />
<br />
But Francis' willingness to rile Ankara with his words showed once again that he has few qualms about taking diplomatic risks for issues close to his heart. And the massacre of Armenians is indeed close to the Vatican's heart given that Armenia is held up as the first Christian nation, dating from 301.<br />
<br />
That said, Francis is not the first pope to call the massacre a genocide. St. John Paul II wrote in a 2001 joint declaration with the Armenian church leader, Karenkin II, that the deaths were considered &quot;the first genocide of the 20th century.&quot;<br />
<br />
But the context of Francis' pronunciation was different and significant: in St. Peter's during an Armenian rite service with the Armenian church and state leadership in attendance on the 100th anniversary of the slaughter. And his call for international acknowledgement of what happened went beyond what John Paul had written.<br />
<br />
Francis' words had a deeply moving effect among Armenians in the basilica, many of whom wept. At the end of the service, the Armenian Apostolic Church's Aram I thanked Francis for his clear condemnation and recalled that &quot;genocide&quot; is a crime against humanity that requires reparation.<br />
<br />
The Armenian president, Sarkisian, praised Francis for &quot;calling things by their names.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the interview, he acknowledged the reparation issue, but said &quot;for our people, the primary issue is universal recognition of the Armenian genocide, including recognition by Turkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
He dismissed Turkish calls for joint research into what transpired, saying researchers and commissions have already come to the conclusion and there is &quot;no doubt at all that what happened was a genocide.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lead sponsor of a new U.S. congressional resolution recognizing the genocide, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), said he hoped the pope's words would &quot;inspire our president and Congress to demonstrate a like commitment to speaking the truth about the Armenian genocide and to renounce Turkey's campaign of concealment and denial.&quot;<br />
<br />
The definition of genocide has long been contentious. The United Nations in 1948 defined genocide as killing and other acts intended to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, but many dispute which mass killings should be called genocide and whether the terms of the U.N. convention on genocide can be applied retroactively.<br />
<br />
Reaction to the pope's declaration on the streets in Istanbul was mixed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad he said it,&quot; said Aysun Vahic Olger. &quot;When you look at history, there's proof of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, Mucahit Yucedal, 25, said he felt genocide is a &quot;serious allegation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't support the word genocide being used by a great religious figure who has many followers,&quot; he said.

			A 73-year-old reserve deputy in Tulsa, Okla., is under investigation after he shot and killed a suspect earlier this month when he mistook his handgun for a Taser, authorities say.<br />
<br />
But the incident also is gaining national attention because other deputies can be heard on video berating the suspect, Eric Courtney Harris, 44, after he had been shot by Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Bates.<br />
<br />
The shooting occurred on April 2 in Tulsa during an undercover sting operation. Days earlier, Harris, an accused felon, had sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer, CNN reports. During the sting, he tried to sell an illegal handgun to an undercover officer in a vehicle.<br />
<br />
As police pulled up on the scene, Harris jumped out of the car and ran. An officer caught up to Harris and Bates arrived moments later. As officers try to restrain Harris, Bates can be heard yelling &quot;Taser&quot; before a shot rings out. Bates then immediately apologizes.<br />
<br />
Oh! I shot him! I'm sorry!&quot; Bates can be heard saying on video. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, God. Oh, he shot me,&quot; Harris yelled.<br />
<br />
Harris then complains that he's losing his breath, at which point a deputy can be heard saying &quot;F--- your breath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harris was taken to a hospital, where he died about an hour after the shooting, reports the Los Angeles Times.<br />
<br />
CNN reports that Tulsa Police Sgt. Jim Clark, who has been brought in to review the case, said Bates &quot;inadvertently&quot; shot Harris and described Bates' actions as &quot;slip and capture&quot;:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Quoting Bill Lewinski, executive director of the Force Science Institute, Clark further explained: &quot;These are mistakes that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another, and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended. In effect, your intended behavior slips off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction.&quot;
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Clark also defended the deputy heard berating Harris, saying that it's likely he didn't hear the gunshot because he was so focused on restraining Harris. He said the deputy thought Harris was out of breath from running.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is my opinion, after reviewing all the facts and circumstances of this case, [the state's excusable homicide statute] was applicable in this incident,&quot; Clark tells the L.A. Times. &quot;Reserve Deputy Bates did not commit a crime. Reserve Deputy Bates was a victim, a true victim, of 'slips and capture.' There's no other determination I could come to.&quot;<br />
<br />
The case has been referred to the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office, which will decide whether to file charges, the Times reports.<br />
<br />
Harris family said in a statement it doesn't think it's &quot;reasonable&quot; to believe Bates mistook a handgun for a Taser.<br />
<br />
<b>&quot;We do not believe it is reasonable for a 73-year-old insurance executive to be involved in a dangerous undercover sting operation,&quot; the statement says. &quot;... We do not believe it is reasonable - or responsible - for [the sheriff's office] to accept gifts from a wealthy citizen who wants to be [a] 'pay to play' cop.&quot;  </b>
