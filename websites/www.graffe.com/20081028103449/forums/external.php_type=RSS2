			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>my cousin's wife was trying to download napster and a bunch of pop ups came on the computer.  i live 3 hrs away and couldn't get up there to look at it.  my niece and her boyfriend happen to be over there visiting and he said he could fix it.  <br />
he downloaded a program called threatfire or something like that. well it said to quarantine and kill a couple programs.  when he did this the comp hasn't worked sense. my cousin is not computer literate at all and his description of what it is doing is,  nothing it won't do anything.  it wouldnt let him shut down, he had to turn off by the power button.  <br />
i asked what programs it said to kill and 1 was adaware so no real big deal there but the other one was windows/system/32  i believe is what he said.  i believe that is what the problem is. <br />
2 weeks ago i had reformated because the comp was running slow and not doing some things you would tell it to.  i also increased their ram from 256 to 1g,  its a secondhand computer they bought a couple years ago. <br />
i have never heard of threatfire and am wondering if any of you with more knowledge then i do have ever heard of it and is it an ok program?  i have heard of webroot and ad-aware for spyware but not the other.  i will be able to look at the comp on thursday.</div>

<br />
Looking for a scary/horror/suspense movie recommendation here.  Something scary.  I do have preferences, but I'm not going to give them because I am open to seeing something I might not otherwise think to be interested in seeing.  <br />
<br />
Maybe something newer, that would be pretty available on the store shelves.<br />
<br />
My family is out of town for much of this week and I am looking for something to get me in the mood while they are gone.  :)  Plus just scary movie recommendations in general because they are fun.<br />
<br />
What do you like?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Red Alert 3, Fallout 3, LittleBigPlanet. Valkyria, Resistance 2, and Gears of War 2 not far after. Fable 2 and Farcry 2 just came out. I'm sure there are others that I'm forgetting. Motorstorm, Eternal Sonata PS3, etc etc. Crazy crazy release schedule.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of you are going to be playing Fallout 3, it's going to be hard to resist the urge to join in but I'm not going to have time for it. My biggest dilemma is LBP versus Valkyria. Valkyria is the reason why I got a PS3, but I've also been looking forward to making levels in Little Big Planet ever since the beta.<br />
<br />
Amusingly enough I'm most pumped for Red Alert 3. The cheesey viral advertising really did it for me. &quot;You want hope, keep dreaming. You want change, put out your cup. You want freedom? Vote for me.&quot; <a href="http://www.ea.com/redalert/factions-allies.jsp?id=PresidentAckerman" target="_blank">Ackerman for president!</a><br />
<br />
So what about you guys? Are the choices as tough for you, or are you content with one or two releases?</div>

CODEWEAVERS' SOFTWARE FREE FOR DOWNLOAD THANKS TO GEORGE W. BUSH AND FALLING GAS PRICES<br />
Giveaway Triggered in CodeWeaver's Great American Lame Duck Presidential Challenge; &quot;We take full responsibility for global economic collapse,&quot; says CEO<br />
SAINT PAUL, Minn. (October 27, 2008)  The catastrophic cratering of the global economy, falling gas prices and President George W. Bush's recent executive activities have indirectly prompted Saint Paul gadfly software developers CodeWeavers, Inc., to provide free software for every American on Oct. 28, company officials reluctantly announced today.<br />
<br />
In July, CodeWeavers  whose software lets Mac OS X and Linux users run Windows programs without having to Microsoft for a Windows OS license  launched the Great American Lame Duck Presidential Challenge (lameduck.codeweavers.com) to encourage President Bush to make the most of his remaining days in office by accomplishing a major economic or political goal by January 20, 2009.<br />
<br />
The goals focused on President Bush making specific positive accomplishments in areas such as the economy, home values, the stock market, the war on terror and other key issues. Specifically, one goal called for President Bush to help down bring average gasoline prices in the Twin Cities to $2.79 a gallon.<br />
<br />
On Monday, Oct. 14, gas prices in Minneapolis and St. Paul did just that.<br />
<br />
&quot;That morning, I was filling my tank at Big Steve's Gas Palace in St. Paul,&quot; said Jeremy White, president and CEO of CodeWeavers. &quot;I had just finished my morning corn dog and 64-ounce Dr. Pepper when I looked at the pump and noticed gas was at $2.79. I screamed Woohoo,' then I yelled Oh, crap!' as I realized every American can now have my software for free. Kind of upsets my fourth quarter revenue projections...&quot;<br />
<br />
White admits this is not how he foresaw the Challenge unfolding.<br />
<br />
&quot;I launched the campaign to inspire President Bush to make the most of his final days in office. Who knew that our Challenge would have this kind of impact on the country?&quot; White said. &quot;On the other hand, who knew that the economy would implode, causing oil demand to drop into the abyss and gas prices to plummet as well. Clearly, investigating Bear Stearns, AIG and those guys is misplaced  CodeWeavers is responsible for this mess. So it's free software for all!&quot;<br />
<br />
How to Get the Free Software<br />
On Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2008, any one visiting the CodeWeavers' Web site (<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com" target="_blank">www.codeweavers.com</a>) will be given a deal code that will entitle them to one free copy of CodeWeavers' award-winning CrossOver software. Each copy comes complete with support.<br />
<br />
&quot;I realize that by giving away all my software, I've caused horrific damage to my company's bottom line,&quot; White said. &quot;In fact, our vice president of sales wretched Starbucks all over his shirt when he learned the news. But, I figure, the way the economy is going, in a few months everyone might be out on the streets, wearing potato sacks and standing in line for squirrel soup, so why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
White also noted that if other Great American Lame Duck Presidential Challenge goals are met, CodeWeavers will once again provide free software. Goals include:<br />
<br />
*Return the stock market to it's 2008 high<br />
*Reduce the average price of a gallon of milk to $3.50<br />
*Create at least one net job in the U.S. this calendar year<br />
*Return the median home price to its Jan. 1, 2008 level<br />
*Bring Osama Bin-Laden to justice<br />
<br />

  Danielle Masseria filed suit last week in Manhattan federal court alleging sexual harassment at the Ecko Unlimited outlet store in the Jersey Gardens mall in Elizabeth. <br />
  Masseria says she was showing a co-worker how to use a backroom computer in June 2007 when she heard manager Kirk Rummer &quot;rummaging through a bag for some change.&quot; <br />
   After approaching Masseria from behind, Rummer allegedly stuck his hands into the back of her pants. <br />
  &quot;He then grabbed and pulled her panties and jeans away from her body and threw a fistful of coins down into the crack of her buttocks,&quot; the suit says. <br />
   Co-worker Justyne Jones allegedly joined in by yelling, &quot;Jackpot! Jackpot!&quot; <br />
  &quot;My whole life has changed since the incident. I don't trust anyone,&quot; said Masseria, whose MySpace page is titled &quot;F*ck It, GeT MonEy!!&quot; <br />
  Rummer could not be reached for comment. Jones, who no longer works at the Ecko store, told The Post, &quot;The way it's portrayed in the complaint is completely untrue.&quot; <br />
   A lawyer for Marc Ecko, Mercedes Colwin, said there was &quot;absolutely no truth&quot; to Masseria's claims. <br /></div>

</div>Yup. Absolutely no truth. I'm sure she just made that one up off the top of her head.<br />

				Arriving at Blackrock Depths, Varian, Thargas and Broll easily battled their way through the Dark Irons but still treaded lightly knowing the fire demigod Ragnaros was still dwelling in the pits of Molten Core. As they drew closer to the prison hold they encountered Golem Lord Argelmach and his small army of golems but Varian dodged Argelmach's lightning and quickly beheaded him with little trouble. The trio found Windsor being tortured by High Interrogator Gerstahn, whom Thargas swiftly killed. Varian cut Windsor free and they hastily made their escape, being chased by fire elementals. Varian and Thargas outsmarted the elementals, causing them to melt an unsupported bridge. As the friends finally escaped Blackrock Depths to make their way back to Ironforge, Windsor finally revealed to Varian what he had discovered regarding his investigation.

Is that particular moment of proud player-character heroism being Morden-Rasp-Retconned out in the interest of making Varian a LAWL BADASS AMNESIAC GLADIATOR KING? I can't believe they would mutilate the established lore in a way that retroactively invalidates things previously done by players. <br />

Anybody actually have the manga?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Last night I caught part of a story on 60 minutes about the U.S. financial crisis and apparently a big part of this story involves the use/abuse of Credit Default Swaps.  I am an accountant and I'd never heard of such an instrument, so I went looking for info.<br />
<br />
Apparently, from what I gather from a Google search, these are basically unregulated insurance contracts to cover risky mortgages/loans.  And from what I am reading there are *trillions* of dollars in CDS outstanding.  So, I kind of understand the concept, but one thing confuses me.<br />
<br />
In this banking mess we are currently in, if the banks had instruments out there that were to protect against mortgage/loan defaults, why are all the banks suddenly needing bailed out?  And why are a handful of brokers making billions on the opposite side of these Credit Default Swaps?  It seems backwards to me... what am I missing?</div>

</div>The Sexism proposal was made before Dmitry called you that.  I brought it up for two reasons:  1) As an illustration of the problem with a Sexism rule (Sorry Voca, that&#8217;s pretty much express sexism as far as I&#8217;m concerned), and 2) because I&#8217;m sick of Dmitry calling everyone he disagrees with a racist and then acting like a bigoted douche bag.</div>
