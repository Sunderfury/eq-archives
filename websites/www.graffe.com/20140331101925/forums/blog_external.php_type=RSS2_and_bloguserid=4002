			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="blogcontent restore">My weekend has, so far, consisted of seeing old friends, opening all the windows for fresh air, turning on both of the Kitty Mesmerizers (dvd player and fish tank), and contemplating what I'm going to cook alongside the currently thawing steaks we picked up a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
For 6pm on the first full day of a three day weekend, this is already turning out to be pretty enjoyable and relaxing.<br />
<br />
But I just ran into a randomly named person in game while shuffling my banked items around in Lord of the Rings Online and had to face a fairly strong feeling that was completely unexpected.<br />
<br />
While sorting through my bank I ran into someone named &quot;Ken&quot;. I had to ask him if he'd ever gone by the name &quot;Destructis&quot;.<br />
<br />
Obviously the answer was &quot;no&quot; because the name is so common, but the fact that the FIRST thing that came to mind was asking whether or not it was the same person we know here at Graffe's made me think.<br />
<br />
I don't expect to see him again, so with the blessing of the cold perspective of hindsight, I felt compelled to say this:<br />
<br />
I was a friend of Destructis.<br />
He showed me that it's unwise to pour your own ocean into a hole.<br />
He taught me about effort and why we are stronger together.<br />
He showed me what an exit looks like from all sides.<br />
<br />
Bi-La Kaifa, and stuff.</blockquote>
