MMORPG_Taera: Diet_Canada :asks: i think what puts most wizards off the new casting system is the change to instants. any chance of maybe returning instants back to what they were or at least make the mr oen useful and the cold/fire ones have 6 sec refresh so spell haste is useful again? :)<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: The instant cast spells are still the best spells in the game for multiple reasons - cast time, DPS, and the ability to cast on the run.<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: Even after the changes they remain the most useful and powerful spells in a wizard's arsenal.<br />
<br />
MMORPG_Taera: Reminder: submit your questions via /msg devbot yourquestionhere<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: There is no way I can balance the other spells around instants, so they had to be toned down.<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: From here on out, the instants will either remain static or be toned down. Those spells will NEVER get any better than they are now.<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: It's bad for class balance, bad for focus itemization, bad for spell itemization, and bad for the game in general.<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: So, again, no.</div>

So you basically continue to treat him like a piece of shit but want him to come here and discuss it?<br />
<br />
As a class, we've demonstrated no ability to discuss this rationally in public.  Several prominent members of the community have basically ensured any debate turns into name calling and demanding he resigns.<br />
<br />
When will you accept he has made a decision, it's his paid job to do so, and you're just going to have to work with him rather than trying to fight against him at every step?</div>

		<div>We haven't been that, but I'm 100% sure that melee would cry much harder, quit much faster and generally just cause a riot until they were de-nerfed :)<br />
<br />
That's my honest to who-ever opinion on it, from seeing the extent of moaning that can come from a minor change to melee dps or a failure to fix a fork up in a matter of weeks:) Prolonged Destruction anyone?<br />
<br />
Trouble here is, with the continued slew of nerfs that's hit us (by chance or conspiracy, I do not know!), we've steadily moved onto the dev shitlist, simply for always having something to bitch about, whether it be instant nerfs, the stupid Prolonged Destruction bug, GoRMs being eaten by fizzles, low dps, low sustained dmg and so on. <br />
<br />
And now we're at a point, where it seems that we are getting pretty much ignored and our issues left in the bottom of the pile. I say we just have to wait it out, 'cause the sustained bitching and moaning gets us no-where. But waiting sucks.</div>

He has line management, line management trust him and believe in his decisions, if they didn't, he would have been moved on.  It doesn't matter how much you thrash, wail and call for him to move, it'll get you no where.  You *would* be better off working with him, and being constructive.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't believe he's taking any notice.<br />
<br />
Instead 'we' as a class are just going to get ignored.<br />
<br />
I know you don't believe me, I know I'll just be pilloried for holding this view, but frankly I'm embarrassed to play a wizard when I read some of the stuff you guys post on the boards.<br />
<br />
You either believe the collective team at Sony have the best interests of the game at heart <b>even if you don't agree with that direction</b> and take part in constructive discourse, or you believe you're being lied to at every stage of the way and just resort to abuse.  I know that the former might not have any impact, and I know that the second certainly won't.</div>

		<div>Kela is absolutely correct 101%.<br />

Did Prathun ever even explain what his issues are beyond generalized statements. He nerfed us back in April and put out a statement about EC that was insulting. Is that how we want to be treated? Even his next statement was given with no interest in pointing issues and discussing options but matter-of-factly saying thats it, no discussion.<br />
<br />
Point simply is that you know this change is weird. You may like it or you may hate it but you know something is out of place. You sure as hell feel that something will change again. Whenever I talk to anyone they say there will be tuning.<br />
<br />
After all the commotion over the past year, nothing but a few generalized statements and cynical comments is simply not enough. I am mad that so many of you are so eager to turn the other cheek and let him treat you like this.</div>

Do you realy think we like trashing Prathun instead of talking to him. Did you see communication with Nodyin. Even Rashere or other Devs. How can you say what you are saying. Prathun is out of control. He is a loose cannon. He does what he wants, how he wants, and has 0 respect for anyones input.<br />
<br />
It is not just wizards, we may have been loud but our tone has been nowhere near insulting compared to what others call him. There is hardly a class that is not complaining.</div>

bold tags changed for truth... clearly they lie to us over and over.  how you fail to see this i do not understand.  i agree name calling and abuse is not constructive, but the company has no respect for the players and prathun is going overboard on the nerfs.<br />
<br />
while i agree that instants were the best spells to cast, the argument for ec and other spells doesn't hold water over the course of the game.  we have ALWAYS gone for the best spell in each particular resist line.  the fact that with tss they happened to be instants doesn't change the fact that we always cast the best spell from each expansion, ignoring all others once we obtained them.  the only variety we had was big nuke, little nuke.  instants actually increased our play variety with them as the standard, but still had the big nuke (ec) for gorm procs or flashy crits and little nukes when we were managing mana.  again, his argument was complete b.s. spin.<br />
<br />
we have been nerfed over and over, yet the position we held prior to all these nerfs was not nearly so overpowering that what we have received was warrented.  tss made the game fun to be a wizard again as it hadn't in years.  slowly, patch by patch they have chipped away at that fun.</div>

		<div>The reason we are nerfed, is because of necromancers. They cried when ooc came out. And they focused their outrage on wizards since we are the simplest embodiment of why they felt slighted by ooc.<br />

I'd also like to thank a few magicians whos sorry state required wizards to be held up for scorn.<br />

Then we round out the universal wizard hatred with beam kiting. That one sure clinched it. Everyone is jealous of wizards. <br />

Since TSS came out we have endured 10x the magnitude of nerfs of other classes combined. And now, after yet another expansion we still hear words about how this class is destined for yet another era of stagnation and decay.</div>

MMORPG_Taera: Diet_Canada :asks: i think what puts most wizards off the new casting system is the change to instants. any chance of maybe returning instants back to what they were or at least make the mr oen useful and the cold/fire ones have 6 sec refresh so spell haste is useful again? :)<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: The instant cast spells are still the best spells in the game for multiple reasons - cast time, DPS, and the ability to cast on the run.<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: Even after the changes they remain the most useful and powerful spells in a wizard's arsenal.<br />
<br />
MMORPG_Taera: Reminder: submit your questions via /msg devbot yourquestionhere<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: There is no way I can balance the other spells around instants, so they had to be toned down.<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: From here on out, the instants will either remain static or be toned down. Those spells will NEVER get any better than they are now.<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: It's bad for class balance, bad for focus itemization, bad for spell itemization, and bad for the game in general.<br />
<br />
EQ_Prathun: So, again, no.</div>

So Prathun has decided to NERF and make obsolete through lack of changes the MAJOR reason for wizards to have even bothered purchasing or playing through TSS.<br />
<br />
Are wizards in TSS balanced with the changes made to TSS as they stand???   No.   I think when Prathun says:<br />
<br />
<b>EQ_Prathun: There is no way I can balance the other spells around instants, so they had to be toned down</b><br />
<br />
It means he is BAD at class balance.   The fact that melee have had near instants for a long time now (justification that they had to melee while casting) but now; somehow giving casters that same dynamic is wrong??? This boggles the mind.<br />
<br />
<b>EQ_Prathun: It's bad for class balance, bad for focus itemization, bad for spell itemization, and bad for the game in general.</b><br />
<br />
This is an admission also that he is bad at class balance, bad at setting focus itemiization, bad at designing any innovations in spells, and perhaps bad for the game in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
In my mind, everytime a spell line or ability is totally nerfed, SOE should go back and rebalance at the same time as nerfing.   In addition, if it provides a new capability, some other just as valued capability should be put in its place.<br />
<br />
Instants provided a few things:<br />
1) Reason to purchase TSS<br />
2) DPS balance to wizards<br />
3) A new, fun game play mechanic to the most boring/monotone classes to play.    Casting on the run.<br />
<br />
I don't see ANY effort to replace all three with the direct nerf or the future &quot;Nerf instants by neglect&quot; approach.</div>

		<div>I find it hard to imagine how people actually consider how instants were in TSS to be anything BUT horrendously overpowered in solo and group content.  Ridiculously so, in fact.  Obviously, they weren't overpowered in raids, but that is because of flawed design concepts that have always been a problem with Everquest.  <br />
<br />
This expansion goes the farthest to get rid of those flawed design concepts than any expansion previous, and yet because an obviously and horrendously overpowered effect got reduced in effectiveness to save the group and solo game from spiraling out of control, some wizards have devolved into the worst examples of mob mentality.<br />
<br />
First, we need to get over the loss of instants.  They were overpowered in too many aspects of play to be able to continue their use in raids.  Moving forward from that idea, we can try to ensure that damage scaling, which we have more potential methods to produce now than ever before, scales properly as we progress through raiding tiers.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'm sickened by the irrationality that so many of you are displaying in the face of a change that was *absolutely* needed to save our class from the kind of &quot;nerf by omission&quot; that plagued rogues for the last 2 years.</div>

		<div>Well, I don't got a beef with him - and I wasn't in beta, but my biggest question is (os so I heard) why were there significant changes or nerfs to all this in the last 5 days of Beta?  No time for the beta wizards to even try it out with parses and whatnot to try to champion a cause that it's too much of a nerf or be able to silence and make us content that it's not really as bad as we think it may be.<br />

				<div style="font-style:italic">The man should resign.  He can't see past his own bitterness for the game anymore.  He needs to be moved to either a part of the game that isn't in constant public scrutiny or moved to games that come and go so he can start fresh every year or two.<br />
<br />
He completely refuses to listen to or accept criticism and instead of considering the ideas of others, he'd rather insult the class as a whole saying that if we don't like our spells we must be stupid players.<br />
<br />
And lets not forget that in addition to completely ignoring and insulting the playerbase, he resorts to threatening them with things that are out of his power to do.</div>

Man, how quickly people forget the good and turn bitter. Prathun saved the wizard class 1 year ago. Did you forget that already? We would NEVER get new harvest, new concussion, instant nukes if Rytan remained the spell dev. If you'd still be playing your wizard today - you'd be crying now crappy Sothgar is and that you struggle to do 50% of rogue's DPS, same as we all did for years, from GoD to PoR.<br />
<br />
Prathun has his own vision, and that vision is FAR BETTER than any other spell dev since whoever did Kunark. Maybe he can't accept criticism (can you?), but he's doing a great job. If you get your way and he resigns or moves to another area - what do you expect to happen? Get Rytan back on spells? He was the GoD - PoR spell dev directly responsible for what wizards became during that time. He'll just stagnate us again. Get another dev? And hope that his vision is better than Prathun's and that he can be your handpuppet - otherwise you'll throw feces at him just the same. You'll simply never be happy until you are designing your own spells. Who said your vision is better anyway?<br />
<br />
Be careful what you wish for.</div>
