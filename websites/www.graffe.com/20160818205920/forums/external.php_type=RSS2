		<hr />
		
			It's not often in the midst of an antitrust fight that the public gets a look at the gamesmanship that's happening behind the scenes.<br />
<br />
But thanks to the Huffington Post's Jonathan Cohn and Jeff Young, we got a glimpse at how health insurer Aetna is making its case to acquire rival Humana — and new insight into Aetna's decision announced Tuesday to pull out of Obamcare exchanges in 11 states.<br />
<br />
The reporters obtained a copy of a letter from Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini to the Justice Department on July 5. The letter was written while the government was still deciding whether to oppose the insurance companies' merger on the grounds that it (and another proposed deal between Anthem and Cigna) would hurt consumers and reduce competition.<br />
<br />
The Bertolini letter was in answer to a Department of Justice request for information about how a decision on the Humana deal would affect Aetna's participation in the health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.<br />
<br />
The letter is pretty direct: If the government moved to block the merger, then Aetna would begin to pull out of the health insurance exchanges.<br />
<br />
Here's the key paragraph (emphasis added):<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			 &quot;Our analysis to date makes clear that if the deal were challenged and/or blocked we would need to take immediate actions to mitigate public exchange and ACA small group losses. <b>Specifically, if the DOJ sues to enjoin the transaction, we will immediately take action to reduce our 2017 exchange footprint.</b> We currently plan, as part of our strategy following the acquisition, to expand from 15 states in 2016 to 20 states in 2017. However, if we are in the midst of litigation over the Humana transaction, given the risks described above, we will not be able to expand to the five additional states. In addition, we would also withdraw from at least five additional states where generating a market return would take too long for us to justify, given the costs associated with a potential breakup of the transaction. In other words, instead of expanding to 20 states next year, we would reduce our presence to no more than 10 states. We also would not be in a position to provide assistance to failing cooperative exchanges as we did in Iowa recently.&quot;
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The Huffington Post reporters calls the letter &quot;a clear threat.&quot;<br />
<br />
A little more than two weeks later, on July 21, the Justice Department said it would sue to block the Aetna-Humana deal and the other proposed megamerger between Anthem and Cigna.<br />
<br />
On Tuesday, Aetna said it would dramatically scale back its participation on the insurance exchanges in 2017. The company move would take it out of 546 counties in 11 states, leaving it active in 242 counties in four states: Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska and Virginia.<br />
<br />
Aetna said the pullback was a business decision stemming from a loss in the second quarter on individual plans and uncertainty about the policy outlook for the exchanges.<br />
<br />
In the company's statement, Bertolini said, &quot;As a strong supporter of public exchanges as a means to meet the needs of the uninsured, we regret having to make this decision.&quot;<br />
<br />
The statement made no mention of the company's pending offer for Humana nor its recent correspondence with the government about how Aetna would likely respond if the feds moved to block the deal. Aetna didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on how to reconcile Tuesday's announcement with the July 5 letter made public by Huffington Post on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
The change in tack for Aetna is also noteworthy because Bertolini was talking up the business potential of the exchanges as recently as April, when he said during a call with analysts and investors that the exchanges were &quot;a good investment,&quot; despite the losses incurred.<br />
<br />
At the time, Bertolini said that Aetna was &quot;committed to working constructively with the administration and lawmakers to find solutions that can improve this program, stabilize the risk pool, and expand product flexibility, all with the goal of creating a sustainable program that makes health care more affordable and accessible for all consumers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, the company appears to be taking its ball and going home.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>LET'S DO THIS!!!!!<br />
<br />
Alrighty, after I was wildly wrong on Iowa's fortune's last year, I mean, who else had Iowa going 12-0 during the regular season, it's time for another round of predict the season!!!<br />
<br />
I'll start with what I have some actual knowledge about before I start predicting things out of my ass, which when you think about, is pretty much what every other &quot;professional&quot; college football prognosticator does. Iowa is returning off of what has to be one of their top 5 seasons ever, missing going to the college football playoffs by 27 seconds. Which is probably just as well because then they got their asses handed to them by McCaffery and Stanford in the Rose Bowl. So, that certainly left a sour taste in their mouths. They have most of their players coming back with the exception of a few lineman, but that's the one area Iowa tends to reload every year with. Their defense should be one of the best in the Big 10, if not the nation. The scheduling Gods have, once again, been kind to the Hawkeyes as they miss both Ohio State and Michigan State and play any team of consequence at home, including Michigan for a Nov. 11 nightgame showdown (I'll be at that one freezing my ass off). There's a real possibility both those teams could be undefeated and ranked in the top 5 going into this game. Assuming Michigan doesn't shit their pants again against Michigan State. That can't happen again, can it?<br />
<br />
Speaking of Michigan/Michigan State, which coach is the biggest douche? Mark &quot;Consequences only matter for shitty players&quot; Dantonio or Jim &quot;I'm an asshole and proud of it&quot; Harbaugh. Tough choice, although I do like how Harbaugh gets under the skin of SEC coaches.<br />
<br />
So, where do they end up? I think Iowa wins the West and Ohio State wins the East. Urban Meyer won't lose it two years in a row, although I don't know who they have coming back. JT Barrett wasn't exactly impressive last year. Ohio State will win because I will never pick Iowa to beat Ohio State until Iowa actually beats Ohio State more than once a decade. For what it's worth, that hasn't happened yet this decade but then they've only played like two or three times (I'm still pissed about the 2010 game).<br />
<br />
As for the national title? It won't be Alabama because they won it last year but I think they make the playoffs. Again, I don't think they go undefeated, but provide the one loss doesn't come during the conference championship game or November (come on, Middle Tennessee state or whichever November patsies Alabama has is not going to beat them) they will still be in. Besides Alabama, who else is there? LSU perhaps...Ole Miss? Ole Miss is a lot like Iowa though, good teams but they just can't seal the deal. Certainly not anyone from the East. That half of the conference is a mess and will take a few more years to come back. It was arguably the worst division out of the Big 5 last season.<br />
<br />
I'm going with Stanford in the Pac-12. Their schedule is brutal this year but they will be in another class this season and McCaffery, the best player in college football returning this season, will lead them to a conference championship. They likely won't go undefeated but they will still get in the playoffs. I'm going to say the Big 12 gets left out again. With the issues at Baylor I'm not even sure there is anyone good enough to do it. So, the ACC champ is the 4th team in and I'll go with Clemson. Mainly because the professional bullshitters are saying that and I really don't know enough about the ACC to say anything else. If it is not Clemson, it will be Notre Dame. I'm pretty sure they play each other again so the winner of that game will get the 4th spot.<br />
<br />
As for my national champion, I'm going with Stanford. They are smart and extremely tough. McCaffery will be even better and not many defenses will be able to contain them plus their quarterback is back. If they survive their gauntlet of a schedule they will deserve the number 1 spot and end up on top.<br />
<br />
So, good luck to this season! With the Cubs putting a serious run at a World Series this year and Iowa with a strong possibility of a 10+ win season it's going to be a fun fall for me!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Looking for some idea's for a family vacation in December 2017.  I guess I should mention why, 11 months ago our 15 y.o. daughter was diagnosed with Acute L<font color="#6A6A6A"><span style="font-family: arial"><b>ymphoblastic </b></span></font> Leukemia. <br />
<br />
She was diagnosed on the 2nd day of 10th grade and was only able to attend 2 days of school this past year.  The first four months were rough her - culminating with 5 days in the hospital during Christmas and feeling miserable for her 16th birthday (January).  Things picked up in February-Apr - she particularly enjoyed MacRoc (benefit for her in memory of James Arney).  Things went downhill horribly in May when she spent 18 days in the hospital with Methotrexate Neurotoxicity (stroke-like symptoms).  Seeing your child paralyzed and unable to walk/talk is almost as bad as the initial diagnosis That was one mentally challenging week for all of us - thankfully our daughter has fully recovered and has no real memory of the worst of it.<br />
<br />
Last Friday, she completed 11 months of intensive chemotherapy and is now in maintenance.  Maintenance is chemo every 28 days until mid-December 2017 (with her central line being removed sometime before then). Hence, the vacation in December 2017.  Not only will she finishing Chemo, but she will be 18 in early January and she will be in her senior year.  Thankfully, the school provided tutors and she was able to complete 10th grade (mostly, she does have a math regents next week).<br />
<br />
Back to vacations.  We are going to Orlando in approx 6 weeks (late September) compliments of Make-A-Wish (staying at give kids the world).  While we all need a vacation now (rough 11 months), we want to do something to celebrate the end of her chemo.  My thoughts:<br />
<ul><li style="">Hawaii</li><li style="">Caribbean</li><li style="">Europe Tour</li><li style="">Germany (to visit grand parents)</li><li style="">Australia (my wife and I went before we had kids</li><li style="">Florida (she would be able to invite friends)</li></ul></div>

			It's a horrifying crime that has so many people outraged. A 13-day-old baby girl was brutally pummeled and killed by her 6-year-old brother, said Florida's Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri.<br />
<br />
The children's mother, Kathleen Marie Steele, 62, has been charged with aggravated manslaughter and neglect for the infant's death.<br />
<br />
On Monday, Steele left the baby, also named Kathleen, in a vehicle with her two siblings while she went into a cell phone repair store. While she was inside the store the infant started crying, and that's when the incident occurred, Gualtieri said.<br />
<br />
The 6-year-old brother picked up the baby and dropped her on the floor of the vehicle, then &quot;slammed&quot; her around the vehicle, the sheriff said. The sheriff says at just 13-days-old, the little girl was killed at the hands of her brother.<br />
<br />
The boy later admitted to investigators what he had done, Gualtieri said.<br />
<br />
“ 'I took the baby, and I slammed her like this, and slammed her down, and pushed her up into the ceiling.' What he was talking about when he pushed her up into the ceiling, he was holding her up, then he said he was flipping her this way and flipping her that way and she would fall&quot; Gualtieri said. &quot;The way he was describing it is he was tossing that baby around like a ragdoll.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gualtieri said the baby's skull was cracked and probably died in the vehicle.<br />
<br />
Steele left the children in the vehicle by themselves for more than a half hour, he said. After leaving the store, Steele drove to Enterprise Rent-A-Car and spent another half hour there before returning home, the sheriff said.<br />
<br />
Gualtieri said the mother is to blame. The boy told her about the baby's condition, yet she ran another errand, before returning home.<br />
<br />
She called a neighbor, a nurse, who recognized the infant was dead but called 911. The child was taken to St. Petersburg General Hospital, where she was officially declared dead.<br />
<br />
Because of the child's age, the boy will not face criminal charges, Gualtieri said.<br />
<br />
“The mistake is with Kathleen Steele, not a 6-year-old boy,” he said.<br />
<br />
Back in 2010, Steele appeared in a reality show 55 and Pregnant. She and her husband had been awaiting their first son.<br />
<br />
Since then, Steele's husband died of cancer in September 2011. The sheriff says with her husband’s frozen sperm she had another son, who is now 3, and had just given birth to baby Kathleen the end of July.<br />
<br />
An accidental fire started in their home days before her arrival.<br />
<br />
Steele was under investigation by the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office Child Protection Investigation Division at the time. At just 3-days-old, the baby fell from her car carrier down the stairs of a Treasure Island hotel. Despite a brain bleed, investigators ruled it an accident.<br />
<br />
Days later, the sheriff said a complaint to the DCF hotline about the mother's inadequate supervision couldn't be proven. Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Mike Carroll said his department had no prior involvement with the family.<br />
<br />
“I'm 100% confident there's nothing else we could've done or should've done,&quot; Gualtieri said. &quot;We couldn't have prevented this from happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Pinellas County school district said the 6-year-old, a first grader, will not be returning to Lakewood Elementary. Pinellas County Schools said it will continue to work with the sheriff's office and Child Protective Services as they establish the best plan moving forward for the child.<br />
<br />
The school was provided counselors for staff and students on Friday.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a heartbreaking situation. The death of a child, of an infant, is so hard to process,&quot; said Superintendent Michael Grego, Ed.D. &quot;I am deeply saddened by this. In the school system our role as educators is to support our students as best we can, even when faced with the unthinkable.”<br />
<br />
The brothers are now separated and in DCF foster care.

			The Zika virus has been found in the sperm of an Italian man six months after his first symptoms, twice as long as in previously reported cases. <br />
<br />
Doctors at the Spallanzani Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome said it pointed to the possibility that the virus was reproducing itself in the male genital tract.<br />
<br />
The infection is suspected of leading to thousands of babies being born with underdeveloped brains.<br />
<br />
Zika is spread by mosquitos. <br />
<br />
The outbreak was declared a global public health emergency by the World Health Organisation in February. <br />
<br />
The doctors' report suggests the potential for the sexual transmission of the virus may be greater than previously thought. <br />
<br />
Current guidelines recommend infected patients should use condoms or abstain from sex for at least six months after the onset of symptoms.<br />
<br />
The doctors said in light of this new evidence an extension of this recommendation might be advised, as well as the continued testing of semen after six months.<br />
<br />
Christian Lindmeier from the WHO told the BBC the report would be looked at.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Zika outbreak is a constantly evolving situation and every new piece of evidence is looked into and evaluated as to whether or not guidelines will need to be revised.&quot; <br />
<br />
The patient, who was in his early 40s, first presented symptoms after returning to Italy after a two-week visit to Haiti in January.<br />
<br />
The patient reported he had received mosquito bites in Haiti, and his symptoms included fever, fatigue and a skin rash.<br />
<br />
Follow-up testing showed the Zika virus was still present in his urine, saliva and sperm, 91 days after the onset of symptoms.<br />
<br />
After 134 days it was only detectable in his sperm and this remained positive after 181 days.<br />
<br />
Previously the longest registered symptoms remaining in the body after their onset was 93 days, found in a 27-year-old Frenchman. <br />
<br />
&quot;The results of this study confirm that the virus could replicate specifically in the male genital tract and may persist in semen,&quot; the Italian team said.<br />

<br />
So far, it's actually a bit like I expected. You are thrown onto a planet somewhere and you have to figure out what to do. I started off on a Toxic planet so not only did I have to figure out how to repair my ship I had to do it while not dieing from being out walking around. It took a bit, but eventually I figured it out. I will say, that was a surprising amount of fun. More than I expected it to be, really. Where I thought running around documenting living things and changing the names of stuff to &quot;penis&quot; something would be the highlight, I'm actually having more fun trying to upgrade my ship and equipment.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just got my ship ready to leave the system so we'll see how it goes from there. For those of you who like sandbox/survival games this one is probably right up your alley.</div>

			Before the Facebook post, former deputy principal Kenneth Rothe, 74, enjoyed his life running two small seaside motels with his wife and caring for his grandchildren.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, Mr Rothe was the subject of a brutal bashing that left him hospitalised for six months and his family were so scared they moved interstate.<br />
<br />
Now a NSW District Court judge has forced the man who wrote the defamatory Facebook post to pay $150,000 in damages.<br />
<br />
In March 2014 electrician David Scott wrote the following post, asking people to spread the word.<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			&quot;Pedophile [sic] warning:- Nambucca has been used as a relocation for these monsters – blue dolphin –nirvana hotel and above the Indian restaurant! …Bus stops are right out front of theses hotels for our children?&quot;
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Mr Rothe was the owner of the Blue Dolphin Motel and Nirvana Village Motel and a rental apartment in Nambucca Heads on the state's mid north coast.<br />
<br />
He sometimes offered crisis accommodation for people fleeing family disputes but emphatically denied he ever housed ex-prisoners or paedophiles under any agreement.<br />
<br />
A &quot;devastated&quot; and &quot;distressed&quot; Mr Rothe begged Mr Scott for a retraction and an apology but neither was given to him.<br />
<br />
Instead his life was seriously threatened – twice.<br />
<br />
There is no suggestion Mr Scott has anything to do with the assaults. <br />
<br />
Mr Rothe told the court that just before the first assault someone said to him, &quot;Are you the Blue Dolphin paedophile?&quot;  <br />
<br />
People started making anonymous phone calls to the motel, some asking for sex, and the Nambucca Valley Crime Information Facebook page republished the allegations.<br />
<br />
Judge Judith Gibson found that Mr Rothe was an upright member of the north coast community who ran his businesses in accordance with the law.<br />
<br />
&quot;This Facebook attack was made on him out of the blue, with no prior inquiry of any kind by any person,&quot; Judge Gibson said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It has had a devastating effect on him,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be fair to say that the publication of the matter complained of has destroyed the plaintiff's wellbeing as well as his peace of mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judge Gibson found there was no factual basis to Mr Scott's claims, he was an &quot;unimpressive witness&quot;  and he had made no attempt to verify the information he had heard from others prior to posting his rant.<br />
<br />
Mr Scott argued he was a father who had every right to warn the community about  potential dangers because there was a crime wave surging through Nambucca Heads which police were powerless to stop.<br />
<br />
Judge Gibson went on to comment about the increasingly common defamatory remarks made on social media.<br />
<br />
&quot;The anonymity, instaneousness and wide ranging reach of the Internet and social media make it a dangerous tool in the hands of persons who see themselves as caped crusaders or whistleblowers, or alternatively want to humiliate or &quot;troll&quot; other members of the community for the purpose of gratifying their own wishes or fears of for the purpose of gaining attention.&quot;

			World Vision is rebutting Israeli claims that the charity's Gaza Strip director diverted tens of millions of dollars in donations intended to help the people of Gaza, and gave it to the Hamas militant group.<br />
<br />
As we reported, Israel indicted Mohammad El Halabi last week and said, among other things, &quot;Money raised to support injured children in Gaza was diverted to the families of Hamas militants who claimed their children were wounded ... Money was paid as salaries to Hamas militants who were falsely registered as World Vision employees ... [and] Costs for legitimate projects such as greenhouses were inflated, with the extra money going to Hamas.&quot;<br />
<br />
The president and CEO of World Vision Keith Jenkins says the group is investigating but, on their face, the numbers don't support the scope of the alleged theft.<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			&quot;World Vision's cumulative operating budget in Gaza for the past ten years was approximately $22.5 million, which makes the alleged amount of up to $50 million being diverted hard to reconcile. Mohammad El Halabi was the manager of our Gaza operations only since October 2014; before that time he managed only portions of the Gaza budget. World Vision's accountability processes cap the amount individuals in management positions at his level to a signing authority of $15,000.&quot;
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Jenkins says the group is carrying out &quot;a full review, including an externally conducted forensic audit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenkins describes World Vision's work:<br />

			&quot;Last year, our work in Jerusalem, West Bank and Gaza, directly benefitted more than 92,000 children; nearly 40,000 of those were in Gaza. These projects focus on children's psychosocial needs, as well as providing medical and other supplies to hospitals, food relief, and re-establishing agricultural livelihoods. These projects have been visited and reviewed by officials from the German and Australian governments, by international donors and our staff and leaders from other countries.&quot;

			“You don’t put your hands on my flight attendant!”<br />
<br />
As far as epic one-liners on airplanes go, it’s not quite Harrison Ford growling “Get off my plane!” before tossing his Russian nemesis off his jet in the 1997 political thriller “Air Force One.”<br />
<br />
But unlike in the aging action flick, this time the line was delivered in real life.<br />
<br />
The heroic moment occurred July 21 aboard an American Airlines flight from Lexington, Ky., to Charlotte, according to the Charlotte Observer.<br />
<br />
<b>The pilot — who has not been identified — was speaking to Michael Kerr, a slurring, belligerent passenger who was captured on cellphone video confronting the flight crew shortly after he’d downed three glasses of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee whiskey, the Observer reported. </b><br />
<br />
According to an FBI affidavit cited by the paper, Kerr refused to sit down when crew members asked passengers to remain seated as the plane taxied to the gate after landing. Instead, the affidavit states, Kerr continued standing and threatened to break a flight attendant’s jaw.<br />
<br />
Moments later, Kerr rushed to the front of the plane, where an ensuing altercation with the flight crew was caught on multiple cameras.<br />
<br />
A spokesman for American Airlines declined to comment on the specifics of the incident but confirmed that the flight crew requested that law enforcement “meet them upon arrival at their gate” because of an unruly passenger.<br />
<br />
Video shows the 25-year-old ignoring a pilot’s command to “take a seat, sir” and instead demanding that the man “move” out of his way.<br />
<br />
“I don’t care what you want to do, you’re going to take a seat right now,” the pilot says.<br />
<br />
“No, I’m not,” Kerr responds.<br />
<br />
Kerr can be seen attempting to shove his way past a flight attendant, using his leg and upper body to press into her while she resists. When he succeeds moments later, shoving the woman to the floor and stumbling forward, Kerr is tackled by the pilot, who yells “sit down” as the two men fall along the aisle.<br />
<br />
“Enough!” the pilot yells. “You don’t put your hands on my flight attendant! Enough!”<br />
<br />
“I am completely relaxed and whatever you do is going on Facebook,” Kerr yells at the captain before calling the man a “loser” between a string of curse words. “Pull me up while you still have a chance to save face — even though you don’t!”<br />
<br />
“You are online,” Kerr adds while the flight crew subdues him using a seat-belt strap, “even though you don’t want to accept it!”<br />
<br />
Brian Colón, a 23-year-old Kentucky man who shot the video, told the Lexington Herald Leader that when Kerr shoved the attendant, the door of the plane was open, but the jet bridge wasn’t connected to the aircraft yet. Police arrived 15 to 20 minutes later, and Colón noted that officers repeatedly apologized to the other passengers for the inconvenience but that Kerr continued to fight back.<br />
<br />
The Observer reported that he spat, yelled and kicked while being dragged off the flight.<br />
<br />
“I was scared,” Colón told the paper. “I was very scared. I felt like the flight attendant’s life was in danger, and I felt like someone else needed to step in, the way he treated her.”<br />
<br />
Kerr has been charged with being intoxicated and disruptive, assault on a female, communicating threats and interfering with the duties of a flight crew or attendant, according to the Observer.<br />
<br />
He was released on $25,000 bond, the paper reported.<br />
<br />
On Monday, a judge banned him from flying while he awaits trial, the Herald Leader reported. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA released a statement highlighting the role of alcohol in “air-rage incidents.”<br />
<br />
“We have seen an increase in these incidents throughout the industry,” the statement says. “The biggest frustration is delays and cancellations, and that has the added problem of people sitting at airports and going to a bar and drinking alcohol. Alcohol is a leading cause of air-rage incidents, as it seems to be in this case.”<br />
<br />
Tanise Love, a friend of the flight attendant Kerr attacked, said her friend — whose name has not been released — has received support since the incident but has been forced to go to physical therapy multiple times a week to address neck and back pain suffered during the incident.<br />
<br />
“She’s as angry as anyone would be, but she’s also very forgiving,” Love said, noting that her friend has been on the job for seven years. “I don’t think she’s so much focused on the assailant or his wrongdoing, she’s just focused on getting better.”

<br />
I mean, obviously this dude is doing something right if his stall sells 180 chickens a DAY, but I was under the impressions that Michelin star ratings were mostly a european thing.<br />
<br />
There are a handful and a half Michelin star restaurants in the US, last time I looked, but the majority are elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I never would have figured Singapore, but I suppose since the judges go everywhere and aren't allowed to tell even their FAMILIES what they do for a living, it doesn't surprise me that one could be over there and hear &quot;If you like food, you really need to try this street cart.&quot; I mean, after all he sells ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY<b> CHICKENS</b> A DAY.<br />
<br />
I also now have MAD RESPECT for the Michelin star system, because of this:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">

			&quot;I asked them, 'Are you joking? Why would Michelin come to my stall?'&quot; he continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said, 'I've never heard of Michelin inspectors visiting a street stall, can even a hawker be nominated?'<br />
<br />
&quot;He said, '<b>We only judge based on the food, not on the venue.</b>'&quot;<br />
<br />
Incredibly, the 51-year-old, who works 17 hours a day, was then honoured with a one Michelin star award.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I had previously just figured it was hoity-toity bullshit, similarly akin to what most wine judging is.<br />
<br />
Apparently not, if a place that'll let you get a meal for £1 gets a star.<br />

Way cool.</div>
