</div>If you plan ahead and plant the quest stuff the day before you'll need it (like the Witchberries for Nana, or the Melons for Yoon before you fight the Hozen chief), four or five days. It's the friends that take much longer, assuming you don't spend a day looking for dirt clumps.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">So my guild finished heroic sha last night, on our last attempt, on our last raid night before the patch.  But lord was this tier brutal.  We only got it because we stopped farming 3 weeks ago when the patch was imminent.  If we had continued normal progression it would have taken us another month at least.<br />
<br />
Killing sha puts us at US 71st though.  And I don't say that to brag.  I say that as &quot;the patch is in 1 day and only 71 10 man guilds have cleared current content on heroic (Out of 15,367 raiding guilds, 4,036 doing heroic).  WTF are they thinking?&quot;.  Wowprogress lists 86 guilds that have beaten heroic sha.  That's 0.54% of the raiding playerbase (2.13% of heroic guilds), the over all playerbase would be much lower.  Only 4052 guilds have cleared normal modes, or 25.27% of the raiding playerbase.  Only 1/4 of all people raiding beat normal mode, that just seems wrong to me.<br />
<br />
This is the 3rd expansion in a row where they are pushing a tier aside before hardly anyone has beaten it.  And every time they do it they miscalculate how long it's going to take to develop the next expansion and we end up in the final tier for a year with nothing to do.<br />
<br />
For reference this tier lasted 23 weeks.  Nearly 5 months is longer than some other tiers like toc, firelands, ect.  But there's 16 bosses this tier compared to 5 or 7.  That's not even 1 new boss every 2 weeks.  Amber shaper alone took us 4 weeks, although it was easily the hardest fight of the tier.  With that many bosses it not only takes longer to get all the bosses down, but farming takes up considerably more of your raid week and leaves very little time for progression.  And if you weren't doing hard modes after the first week, that's closer to 1 boss every week.  Good luck with that.</blockquote>

If you look at Elegon 10-man normal statistics on WoL, he's at 80% wipes. <br />

He's a roadblock to a lot of people (my guild included), and the fact that Garalon, Wind Lord and Amber-Shaper still sits at 87% wipes is pretty amazing. <br />
They have acknowledged the enrage timer problems in this tier, and there are apparently less of those in the next tier:<br />

Yep, we have our share of really bad raiders. But in the previous expansions, we've been able to compensate for this by having excellent tanks/healers and a few exceptional DPS to pull people through.<br />
I'm sure that once we're decked out in 522 and 502 gear, it'll happen. It's just very, very far away at this point in time.</blockquote>

<br />
I am personally an example of where lfr raiding is sufficient for the playtime I put in and have no real desire to to 10 mans. If they're counting lfr as raiders then that may be at least part of the reason for the decline in clearing normal. <br />
<br />
If they want to keep the old content people haven't cleared yet relevant, they should make the tokens that let you roll again for loot in the old raids (which they said would be drops in the new raid, right?) be used to buy upgrades to the old gear instead of rolling for it so you can bring the old raid pieces up to the ilvl of the new but only if you're doing the new content too.</blockquote>

They are supposedly making drops more common from the old tier to help people catch up.  It's not the same as using a token to buy a piece of loot, but combined with free greater charms for more rolls it's better than it was before.</blockquote>
