Ken Livingstone was the Mayor of London for years, he's not some &quot;nothing&quot;<br />
<br />
So, in interview, Mr Livingstone said plainly that MI5, Britain's &quot;national&quot; branch of the intelligence services (MI6 is international), had covered up paedophile rings, so they could find blackmail evidence as leverage on politicians.<br />

			I was raising in parliament against Mrs Thatcher the Kincora Boys Home where boys were being abused and MI5 was filming it because they were hoping to be able to blackmail senior politicians in Northern Ireland.<br />
<br />
They were hoping to catch one of Ian Paisley's MP's - and they never did - and give themselves some leverage. The truth is there's been an awful lot of covering up of paedophiles and paedophile rings for decades and decades.&quot;

bugger all about getting tax of the rich/corporations or clearing this shit up.<br />

If wearing a tin foil hat, is the distinction between being a sane, caring, horribly sickened Human Being, and being a fucking gutless SHEEPLE, then I'm wearing the FUCKING ARECIBO ANTENNA ON MY HEAD!<br />

			Police re-open child sex abuse investigation at Kincora boys home in Belfast <br />
     23 Mar 2013 21:00       <br />
<br />
The probe will cover attacks on boys over two decades at the home in Northern Ireland &#8211; suspected to have been regularly visited by establishment figures<br />
 <br />
   Scandal: Kincora boys home Scandal: Kincora boys home<br />
Pacemaker<br />
  <br />
<br />
Police have reopened an investigation into child abuse at a notorious care home linked to claims of a cover-up by the secret service to protect top level perverts, the Sunday People reports.<br />
<br />
The probe will cover attacks on boys over two decades at the Kincora home in Northern Ireland &#8211; suspected to have been regularly visited by establishment figures.<br />
<br />
Sources told the investigative *website Exaro that the Police Service of Northern Ireland is *asking to interview former residents. Kincora was home to 168 boys aged 15 to 18 between 1963 and 1968.<br />
<br />
Three senior care staff were jailed in 1981 for abusing 11 boys.<br />
<br />
But it is feared there were many more victims and abusers.<br />
<br />
Since the case there have been suggestions that paedophilia at Kincora was linked to Anglo-Irish relations and British intelligence services. There are *unsubstantiated claims that visitors to the home in East Belfast included military, *politicians and civil servants.<br />
<br />
The PSNI returned to the Kincora files as a result of information *received by a public inquiry launched last May into &#8220;historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland&#8221;.<br />
<br />
Retired judge Sir Anthony Hart is chairing the inquiry. It is looking at abuse in residential institutions in the province between 1922 and 1995 and is due to report in 2016. The new probe comes 28 years after a public inquiry chaired by Judge William Hughes ruled there had been no extensive ring of abusers centred on Kincora.<br />
<br />
Three years earlier, in 1982, local politician Joshua Cardwell had committed suicide after being questioned over Kincora.<br />
<br />
He was an East Belfast *councillor who had chaired the committee responsible for children&#8217;s homes in the city.<br />
<br />
Concerns over Kincora were raised in a 1996 book, which claimed one of the convicted child abusers, William McGrath, was an MI5 agent. The Kincora Scandal, by ex-BBC journalist Chris Moore, alleged prominent unionist McGrath had sickening sex attacks on kids covered up. The book said two police probes were obstructed by &#8220;the establishment&#8221; in Britain.<br />
<br />
McGrath, the housefather of Kincora, was dubbed &#8220;The Beast&#8221; by detectives. He was said to be leader of a shadowy paramilitary-style organisation of fanatical Protestants called Tara.<br />
<br />
He was also said to be linked to senior unionist politicians, including Democratic Unionist Party leader Ian Paisley, who officiated at the weddings of two of McGrath&#8217;s children.<br />
<br />
Police were *anonymously tipped off about McGrath a decade before his *arrest. The call is *alleged to have been made by a man who was also involved in the Orange Order and the Tara movement.<br />
<br />
He fell out with McGrath and later repeatedly attempted to *expose his involvement in Kincora.<br />
<br />
In 1990 the BBC programme Public Eye claimed the man made allegations about McGrath in 1975. Those claims were passed to MI5, according to a former Army *intelligence officer who was said to have been blocked from doing *anything with the information.<br />
<br />
Former Army press officer Colin Wallace, who was based in Belfast, has insisted the authorities knew boys were being abused at Kincora six years before they acted.<br />
<br />
The home was opened in 1958 and run by health authorities. It closed in 1980 and three senior members of staff were suspended. They were later convicted of 23 sexual offences against 11 boys in their care between 1960 and 1980.<br />
<br />
Joseph Mains, the warden at Kincora, and his deputy Raymond Semple both admitted all charges. McGrath denied the allegations but changed his plea at Belfast Crown Court. It was claimed in court that abuse took place in bedrooms, while boys were watching *television, in the toilets and on the first floor landing.<br />
<br />
McGrath,and Semple got four years each and Mains got six. McGrath continued to be the *subject of speculation because of his links to religion and a loyalist Orange lodge. He died in 1991.<br />
<br />
In a statement to Exaro and the Sunday People, a PSNI spokesman said: &#8220;There is currently a public inquiry on-going in relation to *historical abuse. Individuals are being encouraged to contact Judge Hart, who is heading the inquiry.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Where appropriate, his inquiry team will pass this information to the PSNI. The PSNI has received a number of referrals.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The reopened Kincora case underlines calls by people who suffered abuse as children for *counselling and other support *services to run alongside police investigations, as reported by the Sunday People and Exaro last week.<br />
<br />
London&#8217;s Metropolitan Police paedophile unit has two *investigations running into claims of child sex abuse allegedly involving VIPs *including senior political figures.<br />
<br />
Police interest in historical child abuse was heightened by the *exposure of paedophile BBC star Jimmy Savile. Keir Starmer, the Director of Public <br />

'Police gunman told me to ignore paedophiles&#8217;, says ex-child protection officer<br />
<br />
A FORMER child protection officer claimed last night a Special Branch detective held a gun to his head to stop him investigating a VIP paedophile ring.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By: James Fielding<br />
Published: Sun, October 20, 2013<br />
<br />
<br />
Chris Fay said he was pinned to a wall and throttled before being given a chilling warning to &#8220;back away&#8221; from allegations surrounding the notorious Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London.<br />
<br />
Young boys in care were allegedly taken there in the Eighties to be abused by high-profile MPs and other powerful establishment figures.<br />
<br />
Mr Fay, who worked for the now-defunct National Association of Young People In Care, accused the Metropolitan Police of acting like &#8220;gangsters&#8221; when news of the scandal broke in 1990. He revealed how some Special Branch members routinely threatened him and his colleagues and even victims over a three-month period of intimidation.<br />
<br />
His shocking claims come as West Yorkshire Police faces accusations that the force protected paedophile Jimmy Savile.<br />
<br />
Mr Fay, 67, of south London, said: &#8220;It became very dangerous. People seem to forget that Special Branch could do what they liked, they were a law unto themselves.<br />
<br />
&#8220;At one point they had me up against a wall by my throat with a gun at my head telling me in no uncertain terms that I was to back away if I knew what was good for me.<br />
<br />
&#8220;A colleague of mine had the same treatment, as did a number of the volunteers. Victims who were actually abused at Elm House were also physically stopped from coming to speak to us at the NAYPIC office in north London.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I witnessed Special Branch officers manhandling them and turning them away with a warning to keep their mouths shut. It was blatant, it was open, they were acting like gangsters.<br />
<br />
&#8220;In the end we had to meet victims at a local community centre without the knowledge of the police to hear what they had to say.&#8221; NAYPIC was given the identities of senior politicians who formed part of an alleged paedophile ring at the heart of government.<br />
<br />
However, Mr Fay said: &#8220;I was told by the police implicitly, &#8216;We do not want you to come to us with big names&#8217;.&#8221;<br />
<br />
In a sinister twist, he said his kitchen window was shot at, leaving three bullet holes in the glass, although he never found out who was responsible.<br />
<br />
In 1982 Elm Guest House was raided by the vice squad but allegations of child abuse were never followed up.<br />
<br />
Operation Fernbridge is now investigating the claims and two men have been charged with sexual offences.<br />
<br />
Police confirmed that Liberal Democrat MP Sir Cyril Smith, who died three years ago, visited the premises.<br />
<br />
Last night campaigner Bill Maloney, of Pie &amp; Mash Films, who has helped raise awareness of abuse survivors and corruption, said: &#8220;These police cover-ups to protect the wealthy and the powerful need to stop now.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Today&#8217;s victims are tomorrow&#8217;s witnesses.&#8221; <br />
<br />
The Met Police declined to comment.<br />

In later years his popularity was considerably marred by the allegation that he had been involved in a cover-up of a health risk at a local asbestos factory. In 2008, there were calls for Smith to be stripped of his knighthood after it was revealed that he had asked the asbestos company Turner &amp; Newall to prepare a speech for him in 1981, in which he declared: &quot;The public at large are not at risk&quot;. It was later revealed that Smith owned 1,300 shares in the company. In 2008 he said that 4,000 asbestos-related deaths a year in the UK was &quot;relatively low&quot;.[2]<br />
<br />
In 2012, following allegations of child abuse, the Crown Prosecution Service formally admitted Smith should have been charged with the sexual abuse of boys during his lifetime. Greater Manchester Police said the boys &quot;were victims of physical and sexual abuse&quot; by Smith.[3][4] In November 2012, GMP Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood said there was &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; that young boys were sexually and physically abused by Smith<br />
