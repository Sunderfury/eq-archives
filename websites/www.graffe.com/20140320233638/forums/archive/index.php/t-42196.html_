Have you been reading that book (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/068816112X/sr=1-1/qid=1153878826/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-5244692-8420058?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books) recently?</div></div><hr />

Me too.  I wonder what got us all reading Replay.  The only recent mention of it was in Dan Simmon's April message to his readers (http://www.dansimmons.com/news/message/2006_04.htm). . . that's where  *I* heard of it.  .</div></div><hr />

Never heard of Dan, My wife checked it out at the library, read it and wouldn;t shut up until I read it. It is vaguely similar to a tale I wrote years ago called &quot;The Very Last Secret Idea&quot; about a man who keeps waking up in an &quot;earlier&quot; period of his life, until he finally wakes up at the age of 10, and changes everything based on what he knows about the future (I remember the future, yadda yadda).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just odd. . .   for some reason, &quot;Replay&quot; keeps popping up lately.  I've also seen it mentioned in the last month or so in various conservative blogs.<br />
<br />
Synchronicity, I guess. . . .</div></div><hr />

Could be. I thought it was a fun read, and well written. I suspect it only appeals to a certain subset of reader though.</div></div><hr />
