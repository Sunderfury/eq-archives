			A 62-year-old veteran died saving a pair of teenagers from a brutal attack, and now he's being hailed as a hero. <br />
<br />
James Farmer Jr. was asleep in his car in downtown Denver on June 16 when he woke up to a homeless man attacking the two teens. He stepped in to protect them. Police say the suspect, 28-year-old DeJuan Stamps, then turned his attention away from the teenagers and beat Farmer to death.<br />
<br />
Farmer was living out of his car at the time so he could find work and send money to his grandchildren and family in Seattle. His plan was to move back in September to buy a home with his fiancée. <br />
<br />
His family remembers him as a hardworking man and beloved father figure. In addition to his fiancée and five granddaughters, he left behind a son and several siblings, nieces and nephews.<br />
<br />
His time in the service, his family says, never left him. <br />
<br />
&quot;He took a oath when he joined the United States Army and promised never to leave a man behind ... He heard someone in need and risked his life to save (the) lives of those teenagers,&quot; they told CNN affiliate KDVR.<br />
<br />
Farmer died near the St. Francis Center, a shelter that provides employment and housing services to help homeless adults in Denver get back on their feet. He was a familiar face at the center and was close with the staff and community there. <br />
<br />
&quot;People who know what's right, do what's right. And he was one of those people who did it. He stepped up to help. And unfortunately, it cost him his life,&quot; a shelter official told KDVR.<br />
<br />
St. Francis held a memorial service for Farmer on Tuesday morning. The shelter wrote on Facebook that it wanted to honor his &quot;ultimate sacrifice.&quot;<br />
<br />
According to the Denver Police Department, Stamps' assault on the teens was an &quot;apparent random attack.&quot; One of the victims, 18-year-old Aidan Brown, was left unconscious and had to get staples in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;He surely would've died had (Farmer) not intervened,&quot; Wes Brown, Aidan's father, told CNN affiliate KMGH.<br />
<br />
Both teenagers and Stamps were taken to Denver Health Medical Center. Farmer was pronounced dead at the scene.<br />
<br />
The Denver police reported Stamps was found standing over Farmer and &quot;continually striking the victim in the chest with force.&quot; Stamps rushed the officers and injured one before he was subdued. He's facing multiple charges, including one count of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree assault.

<br />

		<hr />
		
			NEW YORK — Martin Shkreli is odd, his attorney told a federal court on Wednesday. The former hedge-fund manager’s investors and colleagues made fun of him behind his back and wondered whether he was autistic. Some questioned his sexuality, the jury was told.<br />
<br />
“Is he strange? Yes. Will you find him weird? Yes,” said Shkreli attorney Benjamin Brafman. “But [his investors] used his genius and made millions. . . . Despite his flaws and dysfunctional personality, Martin Shkreli is brilliant beyond words.”<br />
<br />
Shkreli, best known for raising the price of Daraprim — a 62-year-old drug primarily used to treat newborns and HIV patients — from $13.50 to $750 a pill, went on trial Wednesday for allegedly defrauding investors. After struggling for more than two days to seat a jury, Shkreli’s attorney spoke directly to the Brooklyn native’s reputation as the worst of Wall Street.<br />
<br />
“As Lady Gaga would say: He was born this way,” Brafman said.<br />
<br />
Federal prosecutors alleged that for five years Shkreli lied to investors in two hedge funds and the biopharmaceutical company Retrophin, all of which he founded. After losing money on stock bets he made through one hedge fund, Shkreli allegedly started another and used his new investors’ money to pay off those who had lost money on the first fund. Then, as pressure was building, Shkreli started Retrophin, which was publicly traded, and used cash and stock from that company to settle with other disgruntled investors, prosecutors contend.<br />
<br />
Shkreli repeatedly lied to investors, shareholders and the board of Retrophin to cover up  his losses, prosecutors said Wednesday.<br />
<br />
“Telling lies on top of lies — this is what that man, Martin Shkreli, did for years,” said G. Karthik Srinivasan, an assistant attorney general in the Eastern District Court in Brooklyn.<br />
<br />
Shkreli told investors that he had a successful track record as a hedge-fund manager and sent them false performance reports and backdated documents to cover up his losses, Srinivasan said. He told potential investors that his hedge funds had millions more than they did, he said.<br />
<br />
“That was a lie,” Srinivasan said.<br />
<br />
But he was repeatedly able to persuade investors to give him money, he said. “He did this by convincing them that he was a Wall Street genius. In reality, he was just a con man.”<br />
<br />
In the end, Shkreli defrauded investors and Retrophin shareholders out of more than $10 million, Srinivasan said.<br />
<br />
But Shkreli’s attorney dismissed the notion that Shkreli’s investors were victims.  “The people who invested . . . are high rollers,” Brafman said. “All of these people are worth tens of millions of dollars. They were betting on Martin Shkreli’s genius.”  Shkreli, he said, had taught himself biology and DNA sequencing, helping to turn Retrophin into a nearly $1 billion company.<br />
<br />
One investor continued to invest with Shkreli even after a meeting in which Shkreli was dressed in fluffy slippers, he said: “They were not being asked to invest rent money.” Another investor, he said, invested $100,000 and made $400,000. And Retrophin board members, who are also expected to testify, were “thugs” who manipulated Shkreli, he said.<br />
<br />
The colorful opening statements kick-started a trial that got off to a slow start as lawyers struggled to seat an impartial jury. Over three days, more than 250 prospective candidates were dismissed because of their views of the defendant.<br />
<br />
One prospective juror said Wednesday: “The only thing I would be impartial about is which prison he goes to.” Another said he didn’t like Shkreli and didn’t understand “why someone would take a medication that people need and jack up the price.” The potential juror’s voice was shaking as he turned to Shkreli and raised his fist. “I would just go over there . . . is he just stupid or crazy?” the potential juror said.<br />
<br />
“He is probably guilty and there is no way I can let him slide,” a third potential juror said. He then added that he didn’t like that Shkreli had been disrespectful to the Wu Tang Clan. Shkreli purchased the only known copy of an album by the rap group for $2 million and wouldn’t release parts of the album until Donald Trump was elected president.<br />
<br />
In defending Shkreli, Brafman echoed the argument Shkreli himself offered in defending his price hike: He might be obnoxious. He might be outrageous. But what he did was not illegal. It was capitalism at work.<br />
<br />
Brafman appealed to the egos of  the seven women and five men chosen for the jury: They had survived more than two days of intense questions and were “savvy New Yorkers” and would be able to use their “street smarts” to see that Shkreli is not guilty.<br />
<br />
“You can’t convict him for the people skills he lacked,” he said.  “If you want to call him names, call him names — just don’t call him guilty.”<br />
<br />
When Brafman finished speaking, Shkreli stood and hugged him.<br />
<br />
Shkreli’s trial has garnered national attention as much for the charges he faces — he could be sentenced to more than 20 years in prison — as for his boisterous personality. When his decision to increase the price of Daraprim 5,000 percent outraged critics, Shkreli defended the move and said he could have increased it more. Even after being indicted, he struggled to take his attorney’s advice to stay quiet, continuing to battle critics on Twitter and hold hours-long talks about his life on YouTube.<br />
<br />
While the prosecutor repeatedly called him a liar, Shkreli took notes and then smiled at one point.

			The Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear an appeal from Gov. Chris Christie and the state of New Jersey to allow betting on professional and collegiate sports at the state’s casinos and racetracks.<br />
<br />
The case, which the court will hear in the fall, will be a major test for the federal ban on sports betting as established by the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, known as Paspa, which Congress passed in 1992 outlawing betting on amateur or professional athletes except in four states that already had operations.<br />
<br />
New Jersey has been fighting either to overturn the federal ban or to find a way to work around it since 2011, when voters in the state approved a nonbinding resolution to allow sports betting. The effort has since been supported by Democratic and Republican legislators as a way to help shore up the sagging Atlantic City casinos and state racetracks.<br />
<br />
But the effort was met with lawsuits from the N.C.A.A. and the four major sports leagues after Mr. Christie signed a law in 2014 to allow sports betting. The challenges wound their way through numerous lower courts, finally reaching the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia, which issued a ruling last year upholding the federal ban.<br />
<br />
Continue reading the main story<br />
In a news conference in Trenton on Tuesday, Mr. Christie said he was “thrilled” by the decision of the court.<br />
<br />
“The fact that the Supreme Court granted cert. in this case is a very good sign for sports betting having a future in New Jersey,” he said. “I’m encouraged by it. We’re not declaring victory, but at least we’re in the game, and that’s what we want to be.”<br />
<br />
The decision by the Supreme Court to hear the case comes as a bit of a surprise after Jeffrey B. Wall, the acting solicitor general of the United States, asked the court in May not to hear the case.<br />
<br />
Numerous states, including Pennsylvania, New York and California, have recently pushed bills to legalize sports betting. Sports betting podcasts like “Against All Odds” regularly crack the top sports charts on iTunes. Daily fantasy sports sites like DraftKings and FanDuel, which offer a very specific type of sports wagering, remain quite popular.<br />
<br />
At stake is a significant amount of money. In Nevada, where sports betting is legal, it is now an industry of nearly $5 billion a year. Industry and law enforcement officials estimate that more than $150 billion is placed annually with illegal bookmakers and with offshore accounts.<br />
<br />
With that much at stake, the American Gaming Association announced the creation of a coalition this month encompassing attorneys general, the police, policy makers and others to advocate a repeal of the federal ban.<br />
<br />
“We are pleased the Supreme Court appears to have responded favorably to our arguments as to why they should hear this important case,” said Geoff Freeman, the president and chief executive of the gaming association. “And we are hopeful their engagement will provide further encouragement for Congress to take the steps necessary to create a regulated sports betting marketplace in the United States.”<br />
<br />
In a recent meeting with reporters for The New York Times, Mr. Freeman said his organization had detected a new willingness among the sports leagues to make sports betting legal. Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., has been forthright in calling for legal betting and the openness that accompanies it. Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, has acknowledged that a sports betting market would continue to fuel fan interest in baseball.<br />
<br />
The N.F.L., long an opponent of the bill, has signaled a softening of that stance in recent months with the commissioner, Roger Goodell, saying the league’s thinking on sports gambling was “evolving,” a shift underscored in March when team owners approved the move of the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas.<br />
<br />
Mr. Freeman, however, acknowledged that the N.C.A.A. remained the most concerted opponent to legalized sports gambling, noting that collegiate athletes are unpaid amateurs. He said one possible solution would be to prohibit betting on college football and basketball.<br />
<br />
The N.C.A.A. did not immediately comment on the decision by the Supreme Court to hear the case.<br />
<br />
While the court has offered no indication of how it might rule or why it was moving forward with the case, some industry advocates viewed the decision as a sign that the federal ban might be nearing its end.<br />
<br />
“Paspa’s days may be numbered,” said Daniel Wallach, a sports and gambling lawyer from Florida, who has tracked the case closely. &quot;The court can overturn federal statute and provide a free and clear pathway for Congress to take this up. It’s the perfect time for the leagues, casino industry and Congress to come together, and I think it potentially opens sports betting up nationally by the 2018 N.F.L. season.”
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I dunno why the leagues continue to fight this though,  Its not like sports betting is not happening in NJ it is just under the table and with the Mafia.    They claim it could harm the integrity of the game but I doubt Ceasers is going to be rigging basketball games since they win either way.  The mafia guy however...  Lots of incentive to rig games.</div>

			The final week of the Supreme Court session opens Monday, and with it comes rampant speculation that Justice Anthony Kennedy may call it quits.<br />
<br />
If Kennedy does announce his retirement, it would almost certainly ensure not only a clear rightward swing in the Court but would also cement a major part of Donald Trump's legacy barely five months into his first term.<br />
<br />
The best days Trump had on the campaign trail were all centered on the Supreme Court. His May release of a list of 11 people he would nominate to fill the opening created by the death of Antonin Scalia served as a major rallying point for GOP primary voters still wary of backing someone who was a very recent convert to their way of thinking.<br />
<br />
When his campaign was flagging last fall, Trump returned to a familiar strategy -- putting out a wider list of 21 names he might choose to be the next member of the nation's highest court. <br />
<br />
And Trump's single best day as president came on February 1 when he announced Neil Gorsuch as his pick to replace Scalia.<br />
<br />
Why was the Court Trump's biggest crutch with Republican voters both during the campaign and now? Just ask him!<br />
<br />
&quot;If you really like Donald Trump, that's great, but if you don't, you have to vote for me anyway,&quot; Trump told GOP voters in Iowa almost a year ago. &quot;You know why? Supreme Court judges, Supreme Court judges. Have no choice, sorry, sorry, sorry. You have no choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
The point was -- and is -- this: Whether or not conservatives loved or even liked Trump, he would nominate people to the Supreme Court who were considerably more conservative than the people Hillary Clinton would choose. And, the power to nominate justices to the Court mattered more now than ever before because so many of current members were, well, old.<br />
<br />
That includes Kennedy who, at 80, is the second oldest justice behind Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is 84. Stephen Breyer is 78. (For more on Kennedy's pivotal role as the Court's swing vote, make sure to check out Ariane de Vogue's piece here.)<br />
<br />
Conservatives have always cared deeply about the federal bench -- atop which sits the Supreme Court -- but a series of rulings over the Obama years made Trump's argument even more powerful. The Court's decision that the individual mandate at the center of the Affordable Care Act was, in fact, constitutional was regarded by many conservatives as a betrayal. The decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide was just the sort of legislating from the bench conservatives had long warned about.<br />
<br />
If the Court was a major issue for conservatives in the years leading up to 2016, it became the major issue for many of them in the Trump-Clinton race. Sure, Trump said and did things that made them uncomfortable. But what was a little discomfort when compared to decades worth of conservative dominance in the nation's highest court?<br />
<br />
A Kennedy retirement -- whether it comes tomorrow, this week or any time between now and 2019 (after that you can be sure Democrats would block any attempt to nominate a new justice, given the Merrick Garland precedent) -- would mean in the eyes of many conservatives that Trump would be the man who changed the legal course of the country. He would become the new Reagan for many in the conservative movement.<br />
<br />
That perception would be almost entirely unaffected by any and all of the other things Trump has done or will do over the next three and a half years in office. All his tasteless tweets, his braggadocio, his inconsistent commitment to conservative principles on spending, debt and trade (among other things) would pale in comparison to the fact that he was the Republican president that handed conservatives a solid 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court.<br />
<br />
Trump's poll numbers suggest he will face a very tough fight for a second term. His lack of legislative accomplishments could cost him control of the House in 2018. But if Kennedy retires and Trump nominates a reliable conservative justice to replace him, Trump's legacy will be, in no small part, cemented for the very conservatives who held their nose and voted for him.<br />
<br />
A Kennedy retirement this week would also make good on Trump's to-date groundless boast that he has accomplished more in a few months than many presidents do in a few years.

			John Oliver, HBO and Time Warner have been sued for defamation for allegedly executing a &quot;maliciously planned attempt to assassinate the character and reputation&quot; of an Ohio coal company and its boss during a long-form story about the industry on Last Week Tonight's June 18 episode.<br />
<br />
The piece sought to determine what measures actually help out-of-work miners.<br />
<br />
&quot;Donald Trump insists that he's helping miners by reducing regulations on coal miners,&quot; Oliver said during the segment. &quot;But too often, people conflate coal, coal miners and coal companies and imply that when you help one, you help them all. But they are not all in the same boat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Murray Energy, an Ohio-based coal company, and its CEO, Robert Murray, filed the suit Wednesday in Marshall County, W.Va., accusing Oliver and HBO of a &quot;callous, vicious and false&quot; attack on the coal industry, part of their &quot;most recent attempt to advance their biases against the coal industry and their disdain for the coal-related policies of the Trump administration.&quot;<br />
<br />
Murray Energy employs about 5,400 people, about half of those in West Virginia.<br />
<br />
The lawsuit describes Murray, 77, as a man who needs a lung transplant who does not expect to live to see the case's outcome. Murray is seeking financial damages and a court order barring rebroadcasts of the Sunday segment's &quot;defamatory statements.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver's Last Week Tonight segment lampooned the Trump administration's effort to revive the coal industry, saying coal has declined over decades as other energy alternatives have advanced. He also jokingly likened coal to &quot;cocaine for Thomas the Tank Engine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Murray's claim that President Trump &quot;gets&quot; the coal industry was caustically dismissed by Oliver on the show. &quot;Uh, hang on there, Bob, no he doesn't. He barely gets what mining is,&quot; Oliver said.<br />
<br />
He ribbed Murray, describing him as a &quot;geriatric Dr. Evil,&quot; and noted that the company had fought against coal safety regulations while blaming President Obama's efforts on mine safety for damaging the industry.<br />
<br />
The Last Week Tonight story specifically mentioned the company's unsuccessful attempt to block a regulation &quot;aimed at reducing miners' exposure to coal dust, which causes black lung, a disease that killed as many as 10,000 people between 1995 and 2005. Murray insisted the rule was 'illegal, destructive and did nothing for their health, although last year, with the rule in effect, government reports found dust levels fell to historic lows.&quot;<br />
<br />
Murray's suit suggests he did not appreciate the jokes, calling the segment &quot;designed solely to harass and embarrass&quot; him and his company.<br />
<br />

<iframe class="restrain" title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aw6RsUhw1Q8?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<br />
<br />
&quot;Defendants childishly demeaned and disparaged Mr. Murray and his companies,&quot; the suit says. He accused Oliver of making jokes about his age, health and appearance. He &quot;made light&quot; of a 2007 mine collapse in Utah (in which nine people died), broadcast false statements and incited viewers around the world to &quot;do harm to Mr. Murray and his companies.&quot;<br />
<br />
The suit says Oliver and HBO ignored information Murray sent the show showing that an earthquake caused the 2007 collapse at Crandall Canyon mine. Even before the broadcast, the suit says, Murray warned Oliver and his producers that they were relying on outdated, false and &quot;discredited media reports&quot; about the collapse.<br />
<br />
Oliver actually cited a report from the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration stating the accident was caused by &quot;unauthorized mining practices&quot; and that there was &quot;no evidence that a naturally-occurring earthquake caused the collapse.&quot;<br />
<br />
The suit said Murray has been advised to stop working because of stress. &quot;But nothing has ever stressed him more than this vicious and untruthful attack,&quot; the suit says.<br />
<br />
Oliver has not personally responded to the lawsuit but Jeff Cusson, a representative for HBO, told USA TODAY that the subscription-based cable network has &quot;confidence in the staff of Last Week Tonight&quot; and that it does &quot;not believe anything in the show this week violated Mr. Murray's or Murray Energy's rights.&quot; He added that the statement had been filed with the court.<br />
<br />
Oliver noted on the show that Murray Energy has a litigious past, and last month sued the New York Times for libel. And he added that the show contacted Murray Energy for the story, they got back a letter threatening immediate litigation if they did not &quot; cease and desist from any effort to defame, harass or otherwise injure Mr. Murray or Murray Energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Incredibly, the comedian noted that despite four seasons of in-depth reporting on controversial issues, &quot;A cease-and-desist letter is something we've never received before on this show.&quot; (According to Cusson, the Murray case is the first lawsuit to be filed over a Last Week Tonight story.)<br />
<br />
But this is not the first time an industry or a company has sued an entertainer or celebrity for defamation. In 1996, during the mad-cow disease scare, Oprah Winfrey discussed the beef industry on her talk show, at one point exclaiming that revelations about its practices &quot;stopped me cold from eating another hamburger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Beef prices plunged after the episode aired. A group of angry cattle ranchers in Texas filed a $10.3 million lawsuit claiming she defamed the entire industry. Two years later, they lost in court. &quot;Free speech not only lives, it rocks,&quot; Winfrey exulted to reporters when she emerged from the courthouse in Amarillo, Texas.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still off hamburgers,&quot; she added.

<br />
But, it turns out, they're not so hot on spelling. In fact, staff at the LHC are so bad at spelling, they've misspelled their own name on their website 165 times in the worst way possible.
