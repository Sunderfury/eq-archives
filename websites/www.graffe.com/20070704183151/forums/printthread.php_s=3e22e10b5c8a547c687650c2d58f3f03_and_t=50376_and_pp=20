			<div><strong>Wizard Nuking Patterns</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>Looking at spells in isolation gives poor results.  Wizards haven't chain-casted as single spell in a long time.<br />
<br />
So let's look at nuking patterns.<br />
<br />
As it happens, a really nice way to look at patterns is via DPS and MPS, instead of DPS and DPM.<br />
<br />
Given a bunch of pattern of nukes, a wizard can:<br />
A) Slack off, and reduce both DPS and MPS by spending some of her time doing nothing.<br />
<br />
This means if a pattern is X DPS and Y DPM, the wizard can produce a pattern of X/2 DPS and Y/2 MPS &quot;for free&quot;, just by spending half her time doing nothing.<br />
<br />
B) Mix two patterns.  Spend half of her time in one pattern, and half of her time in another.  Or 25/75.  Or 10/90.<br />
<br />
This results in a linear combination of the two pattern's DPS and MPS.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Note that DPM still matters.  But DPM=DPS/MPS, otherwise known as the slope through the point (DPS,MPS).  This trick makes creating useful scatterplot graphs easy.<br />
<br />
So any nuking pattern with less (DPS <b>and</b> (DPS/MPS)) than any other nuking pattern is a junk nuking pattern.<br />
<br />
Here is a spreadsheet that calculates wizard nuking pattern DPS and MPS from raw spell data and some information about the character and buffs on the charager, graphs it, and lets you see which nuking patterns are junk.<br />
<br />
I used it to find a sequence of increasing DPS nuking patterns that aren't junk.  :)<br />
<br />
<a href="http://theorem.ca/~afn/temp/wiz_area.zip" target="_blank">http://theorem.ca/~afn/temp/wiz_area.zip</a><br />
<br />
Here is the resulting graph:<br />
<img src="http://theorem.ca/~afn/temp/wiz_graph.png" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
The slopes from the points to the origin represent &quot;slacking off on that pattern&quot;.  You want to be as far right (highest DPS) and as low (lowest MPS) as you can, given your time/mana constraints, when nuking.<br />
<br />
The points in the middle are the junk points -- they can be beaten by using a higher DPS nuking pattern and slacking off.<br />
<br />
The connected set of points along the bottom are an attempt to generate a collection of &quot;optimal&quot; nuking patterns.  These patterns produce the most DPS one can at the least DPM cost.<br />
<br />
Notice the nearly vertical section around 2000 DPS.  That represents going from (wild3 + FF3) with EC on GOM's to (soth3 + FF3) with EC on GOM's.  You gain a small amount of DPS, for a significant drop in efficiency.<br />
<br />
Another area of interest is the two points hovering around 1500,100, close to each other.  Those represent chain-sothgar with EC or FF on GOM Procs.<br />
<br />
The point up and right of them, around 1600,130, is sparks+FF with EC on GOM procs.<br />
<br />
The points in the far upper right are insta-chains, with various choices asto what to do on GOM procs (EC, EC if you just cast FF and FF otherwise, or instas on GOM proc no matter what).<br />
<br />
Down at the lower left of the graph we see the efficient nukes in a cluster.  Wild, Chaos, and Claw, with FF or EC on GOM procs.<br />
<br />
Here is the summary of the nuking patterns that the above work found to be good.  I make up names for them while I was at it:<br />

You can see them on the graph -- they are the points linked along the bottom of the graph.<br />
<br />
Edit: I just spotted a minor error.  I need more DELAY_3 non-nuking in the chain-instant nukes.  Fixed.  (DELAY_3 means wait 3 seconds total -- when chain-casting insta nukes, you have to wait some time as your spell gems refresh).<br />
<br />
Note that the order of the nukes aren't represented -- all that matter is what collection of nukes do you cast, on average.<br />
<br />
If you get a GOM every 10 nukes, that means you get a GOM'd nuke for every 10 nukes you cast.<br />
<br />
Hmm.  I also underestimated the number of GOM procs, because I'm not accounting for GOM procs on GOM nukes.  Oh well, that's relatively minor.</div>

		<div>Excellent!  Thank you, Yakk.<br />
<br />
Yes, any time the curve goes concave, you have a bad point.<br />
<br />
One glaring omission I notice is Intertwining Energy.  I know it will add a lot of complexity to the chart, but would it be possible to calculate patterns with IE?<br />
<br />
When I get a Weave of Power, should I cast an EC (since weave is a focus, we get more total damage from a bigger spell on the next cast?)  Or should I cast another IE?  Or should I just continue my pattern normally?<br />
<br />
Or is IE as useless as Sothgar's is?  My gut feeling tells me it is a good spell, but I'd love some nubers to prove it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then we need another calculator to estimate how much MPS we should be using for any fight:  I expect this fight to last 10 minutes.  I expect 2 harvests in that time.  I start with X manapool.  I regen Y mana per tick from buffs/flowing thought.  Plug it all in, and it spits out how much mana per second you need to go OOM at the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
For example, one fight that calculator gives me 75 mana per second.  Then I look on your chart.  I see I am about halfway between Wilderness and GoWild.  So I can now estimate my optimal nuking pattern will be about 3/4 Wildmagic Strikes and 1/4 Flashfires (with EC on GOM procs.)  <br />

		<div>The resist rate on Wildmagic has been fixed, Airanemyer.  It is a very good spell now.  Wildmagic is a 3 second cast spell and is SO much more efficient than Sothgar's (7.67 unfocused, compared to 4.97) that it is really not too surprising that it is an all-around better spell.<br />
<br />
And yes, in a group you can usually catch a tick or two of OOC regen between pulls, and then med to full when the cleric also needs mana.  So you may afford to use the very high mana per second patterns--that is the ones with lots of instants mixed in with a few other spells.</div>

		<div>Create a &quot;weaved&quot; spell of the type you want to cast.  Setting it up could be tricky -- need details on how focus effects stack.<br />
<br />
Might just want to split worn and buff focus effects.  Then you could add in &quot;extra buff focus&quot; column...  Would work nicely.<br />
<br />
Then your nuke pattern just takes the chances into account.  If you cast X every weave of power proc, you just add (weave casts)/4 casts of X to your nuke pattern.  The same for the 1/100 negative weaves (you can add in DELAYs if you end up just waiting for it to go away).<br />
<br />
And yes, the &quot;good&quot; nuking patterns will form a convex-up hull.  If one wants a variety of nukes to be used depending on the situation, one needs to place nukes so that nuking patterns using them lie on a convex-up hull.</div>

<br />
*nod*, and the surprising conclusion I came to is that a mix of FF, Wildmagic and CBS will outperform any of those mixtures.  In all cases short of chain-instant-as-fast-as-you-can-and-still-can't-go-oom, EC on GORM procs produces a better result than an instant, if only marginally (a difference of a few percent damage).<br />
<br />
The change from (Soth+FF) to (FF+(Wild|CBS)) is a significant power boost, however.  A wizard going all-out (Soth+FF) could, in the same amount of time and with the same amount of mana, do a good ~150 more DPS.</div>

		<div>Im very happy they fixed wild. When I first got it in the first few days of the expansion I loved using it when it hit but the resists got to much and I never loaded it.<br />
<br />
I personaly hate medding when the group doesent have to so I try to balance my mana out with my mana in after harvests and such. In many missions you are constantly moving so med time only comes when someone needs an afk.<br />

		<div>So I decided to try out the Wild/FF with EC on GoM. We went back to demi cuz it was a saterday night and we only had like 33 in the raid. Maggot was dumd enough to pop after we had killed all tier 1 but hatchet so I could use silent casting and the like. Here were my results.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c30/airmanmeyer/maggot.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
Now Please remeber we had around 35 in raid including alts so raid DPS was pretty low. I had 16k mana when we started and around 500 when he died so I effectively used all my mana. No harvest or mod rod was used either. I did have a bard.<br />
<br />
I chain casted Wild/FF untill Maggot was at 25% and I had enough mana to chain FF/CS till he hit 1% when I used a wild. Looking back at older parses that are around the same time frame this looks to be a slight bit better then a FF/sothgar combo. But imo wizard DPS is so dependent apon a good crit rate and low resist rate that you might never find the perfect combo.</div>

		<div>The benefits of using Wildmagic/FF increases if you use per-spell boosts, like mana recursion (though you do need the enchanter to rebuff you with mana recursion pretty quickly).<br />
<br />
You are getting off about 16 spells/minute with Wild/FF, vs about 12 spells/minute with Soth/FF.<br />
<br />
(10.8 fire nukes, 2.8 ice nukes, 2.4 magic nukes -- so even if you have pyro song in your group, Wild/FF is close to Soth/FF in delivering the +damage).<br />
<br />
But yes, your DPS is dependent on getting good luck with crits.  With wildmagic, it is also dependent on getting good luck with pure wildmagic nukes (they do significantly more damage).  But getting your average damage up is a good way to make the luck matter less.  :)</div>

If the regen and mana pool loss wasent so big from Loyal to Ro's Incendiary I might pop it more but as it is i prefer to have the regen in anyfight over 4 min. Now If I poped Ro's and had a chanter buffing me that would be the best of both worlds right?</div>

before the instant nerf i thought flashfire and CI was a good combo with a bard fire song/mf too and got some good results in fc with that. just keep in mind 3/4 your mana going into a 3.9 dpm spell doing that, though so need some outside help like mf/bard fire song. :) of course  bard's now since the Gorm on proc's nerf are a thing of the past for casters, though.</div>

Hmm.  Ok, I think I can rework the spreadsheet to take that into account.<br />
<br />
It won't tell you what to cast during the power/weak period, but making it easy to add in &quot;nuke X while Power&quot; and &quot;nuke X while Weak&quot; should be doable.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
What does it take to make non-instants worth casting?<br />
<br />
I'm taking as fixed &quot;Wildmagic Strike&quot; and the Instant spells.  I spent a bunch of time tweaking the calculator...<br />
<br />
Claw: Mana cost reduced to 200<br />
1811/5/261 to 1811/5/200 cold<br />
DPS: 954<br />
DPM: 38.2<br />
<br />
Chaos: Mana cost reduced to 250 from 328<br />
1876.5/3/328 to 1876.5/3/250 fire<br />
DPS: 1091<br />
DPM: 29.7<br />
<br />
Wildmagic: left alone<br />
*/3/295 to */3/295 fire/cold/magic<br />
DPS: 1231<br />
DPM: 28.4<br />
<br />
Leap: Damage increased to 3000, mana reduced to 400<br />
1820/3/408 to 3300/3/400 magic<br />
DPS: 1545<br />
DPM: 24.7<br />
<br />
Ball Lightning: Revamped<br />
4365/7/840 to 5500/6/700<br />
DPS: 1838<br />
DPM: 23.1<br />
<br />
Icefall: Revamped<br />
4569/8/832 to 6500/7/950<br />
DPS: 2054<br />
DPM: 20.8<br />
<br />
Sothgars: Revamped<br />
5088/8/1024 to 7150/6.5/1100<br />
DPS: 2<br />
DPM: 19.2<br />
<br />
EC: Damage increased to 9350<br />
7894/8/1984 to 9350/8/1984<br />
DPS: 2596<br />
DPM: 13.7<br />
<br />
That is the scale of the changes required to make most non-instants worth using.<br />
<br />
DPS/DPM are assuming (30% mpres, 80% total damage foci, 33% haste+QD3)<br />
25% crit chance, 2.65 crit mult, bard fire/ice song, mana recursion 2.<br />
0.25 UI/network lag between casts.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://theorem.ca/~afn/temp/wiz_graph3.png" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
The upper curve is instants and wildmagic.  (it uses the upgraded EC and (at the base) the upgraded Claw, but other than that, is the current state of EQ wizards).<br />
<br />
The lower curve are the revamped non-instant nukes.  The gap between the curve is the size of the DPS upgrade at a given MPS.  I left the two graphs unconnected: once you <br />
<br />
The three isolated points are, from bottom left to top right:<br />
Current Sothgars with EC on GOM.<br />
Current Sothgars + FlashFires, with EC on GOM.<br />
Upgraded EC, chain-cast.<br />
<br />
The points along the new curve are (all use EC on GOM procs):<br />
<br />
Chaos.<br />
Wild.<br />
Leap.<br />
Ball.<br />
Icefall.<br />
Sothgars.<br />
Icefall+ColdSnap.<br />
Sothgars+FlashFires.<br />
<br />
The image might be a bit out of date -- I did further tweaking: the impact of &quot;bonus damage&quot; abilities (mana flare, bard pyro/chill, etc) really swing the balance between slow and fast casting spells.<br />
<br />
I'm frankly surprised by how much I had to improve some spells to make them viable competition against instants.  I feel that I must have made an error -- where the other nukes <b>that</b> bad compared to instants, really?<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The impact on grouping by the above change is likely to be minimal -- it is probably still optimal to chain-cast instants, then OOC regen the mana back.<br />
<br />
The change on raiding is that the wizard has to figure out resists and expected fight duration <b>before</b> the raid, and pick the right set of spells to use.  A misjudgement will result in lower than maaximium wizard damage on that raid.<br />
<br />
Before I'd think this is polished, I'd want to figure out what the typical MPS usage over a raid is.  Ideally we'd want the range of raid MPS to cover a reasonably complex set of options, with negative consequences if you picked the wrong ones.  I'm a bit afraid that the answer might become &quot;just cast sothgars's and flashfires&quot; to nearly every raid if I'm not careful.<br />
<br />
The other problem is that this doesn't address the group game.<br />
<br />
Are instant nukes dominant in a low-downtime group game group?  (they are clearly dominant in any high-uptime groups)</div>

		<div>A point about Wild3, CI3 and IE3: those spells are pretty much unavailable. Not only you have to win at least several Solteris events to get Wild3 (and I suspect IE3 will only unlock with the Event 7 win), but it's also extremely unwise to spend your hard-earned Phosphenes to buy Rk3 spells instead of gear. Whoever decided that spells and gear should be bought for the same currency must have been stoned. Basically, you'll have to beat Solteris and farm it to the point of not wanting any more gear upgrades before you even consider buying Rk3 TBS spells - the new expansion will outdate them way before it happens for most of us. So, for all intents and purposes, it's Wild2, CI2 and IE2 to be included in the calculations.</div>

		<div>Ah, so I should redo some charts using Wild 2.<br />
<br />
It is possible that the rank 3 of some spells might be worth not getting gear....<br />
<br />
Spells get about 4% more damage and 4% more mana cost when you upgrade them from Rk II to Rk III.  This won't translate to a 4% upgrade, but it will translate to an upgrade in total damage done.<br />
<br />
What is the relative price of gear and spells?<br />
<br />
I guess I should also take into account that TBS spells should be better than TSS spells: currently I don't do that.  Maybe the dominance of Wildmagic over every other non-instant spell is a good thing. ;)  (well, maybe not IE -- haven't analyzed IE yet)</div>

Actually, upon checking, Wildmagic 3 is the first Solteris spell, available for beating the first event - that's the good news. The bad news is that it's priced at 50 phosphenes, and (according to those who beat more than 1 event) each next spell is 25 more expensive than the last. The gear starts from 100 (bracers) and goes up to 200, etc. And the phosphenes drop from raid bosses in clusters of 100, 200, 400 (?), 700(?) - didn't get a confirmation for sure, but it's multiplies of 100. So you can only loot those nice and round amounts of currency. That makes it real inconvenient to buy spells - you get uneven amounts of currency left for the gear, or you have to spend it on stuff like Tendrilmist Rk3 - which is plain stupid.</div>

Your analysis, Yakk, has been fantastic.  My fear is that this analysis will be turned into a reason to further nerf instants as opposed to increasing the other spells.  That has ever been the SOE way of handling disparities such as the ones your analysis has discovered.<br />

I highly doubt that there will be any more nerfs on the existing spells. Maybe some improvements to non-instas that Prathun promised, but not nerfing again. The reason is that they are already working on the next expansion. Since it's a 1-yr cycle now, and every expansion is a level raise - then every expansion will have to extend all spell lines that need to be extended. What was previously done for spells over 4 expansions will now have to be done in 1. Therefore we'll see a full set of new lv 76-80 spells outdating the existing ones, and there is no point in nerfing what we have for just the next 5 months. I'm pretty sure that new insta-nukes won't be nearly as powerful compared to other spells as TSS ones were. But then we'll have to make sure during Beta that other spells don't suck as hard compared to instas as our current ones. Sign up for Beta when it comes up, spend time there actually testing spells and AAs, post feedback, make your opinion heard.</div>
