			 <div style="margin-left:40px"><ul><li style="">Dr. John Garland's lawsuit alleges that &quot;a small, powerful group&quot; worked to &quot;destroy&quot; his career, as well as the career of his husband.</li><li style="">Garland has sued the university, as well as eight current and former employees.</li></ul></div><br />
A white professor is suing Alabama State University (ASU) over claims the historically black university discriminated against him and his partner based on their race and sexual orientation.<br />
<br />
According to the lawsuit filed in federal court on June 11, Dr. John Garland is suing the ASU and eight current and former employees for racially discriminating against applicants for university positions and subsequently targeting him when he retaliated against those practices.<br />
<br />
“[Garland’s supervisor] expressed his opinion, stated or implied, that Dr. Garland did not belong at the University and was not ‘suited to [the University’s] type of students’ because Dr. Garland is not African-American,” the lawsuit states.<br />
<br />
Garland, who is a member of the Choctaw Nation but is identified as white by colleagues, was hired by the university in August 2008 as an adjunct professor. In January 2009, Garland was rehired as an assistant professor for the Master of Rehabilitation Counseling Program in the Department of Rehabilitation Studies in the College of Health Sciences (COHS).<br />
<br />
His white same-sex partner, Dr. Steven Chesbro, was hired at the university around that time. They legally married in Maryland in February 2013.<br />
<br />
Chesbro is currently dean of COHS, which the lawsuit alleges that students and faculty commonly refer to as “the White House.” He has an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charge filed against the university. <br />
<br />
“A small, powerful group at the University believes that Drs. Garland and Chesbro have no place at the University simply because of their non-African-American or non-Black identity,” the lawsuit reads. “This group, including combinations of the individually named Defendants, have conspired to destroy the careers and employment of these two dedicated teachers.”<br />
<br />
“Some administrators and faculty welcome and support Drs. Garland and Chesbro as colleagues, while others reluctantly accept their presence as a necessary evil due to legal considerations,” the lawsuit continues.<br />
<br />
A university spokesperson declined to comment on the case as it’s an ongoing lawsuit.<br />
<br />
“ASU has just been served with a copy of the lawsuit today and since it concerns an on-going and active lawsuit, the University has no comment about it,” ASU officials told Campus Reform in a statement.<br />
<br />
According to the lawsuit, Garland was promised that he would be “laterally” transferred to a different position in 2013 due to the tense he had with his supervisor, a violation of Garland’s contract. The transfer reduced his salary by $23,000 per year.<br />
<br />
Garland also alleges that the university operator would incorrectly inform callers that he “no longer works” at the university. A university operator provided Campus Reform with Garland’s email address—albeit an incorrect one—but refused to state whether or not the professor was still actively employed at the university.<br />
<br />
The 46-year-old professor argues he is “entitled to reinstatement to his former position, or a comparable position, and the removal of derogatory, defamatory, and inaccurate material from his personnel file, back pay and lost benefits and ‘freedom to work in a non-discriminatory, non-retaliatory, and non-hostile environment.”<br />
<br />
Garland's lawyer, Wayne Sabel, told Campus Reform that both men plan to stay at ASU but &quot;will continue to seek a favorable resolution to the issues raised in the lawsuit and charge.&quot; Sabel said the case is expected to be litigated over the next year or so.<br />
<br />
Neither Garland nor Chesbro responded to requests for comment from Campus Reform. An automated email from Garland said he is out of the office until after July 7.<br />
<br />
According to the Montgomery Advertiser, this isn’t the first discrimination suit ASU has faced in federal court. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a sexual and racial discrimination verdict which awarded $1 million in back pay and lost wages to three female employees in September 2013.

			European players of massively multiplayer online games PlanetSide 2, DC Universe Online and EverQuest 2 will have to transfer their accounts to Sony Online Entertainment in the near future.<br />
<br />
Currently, European players of those games hold accounts with ProSiebenSat1. Games (PSG), not their developer, Sony Online Entertainment.<br />
<br />
In a joint statement published on the PlanetSide 2 website, PSG and SOE served notice that players will be given the opportunity to migrate their account on or around 1st July 2014. All earned status, characters and in-game coin will transfer with the account.<br />
<br />
PSG will cease all hosting and support for SOE games as of 1st July, so you won't be able to log in and play using your current PSG account. You need to complete the migration process to move it to SOE.<br />
<br />
You have a 90-day window, currently estimated to run from 1st July to 28th September inclusive, to migrate your account from PSG to SOE.<br />
<br />
Region locks were lifted today, so new players who want to register should do so on SOE websites.<br />
<br />
Your payment details and personal information won't be transferred, however. You need an existing SOE Station Account or will have to create a new SOE account to keep playing the games.

			Author Daniel Keyes, whose novel &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; became a classroom staple that explored the treatment of the mentally disabled and the ethics of manipulating human intelligence, has died, his family said. He was 86.<br />
<br />
Keyes died Sunday of complications from pneumonia, said his daughter Leslie Keyes.<br />
<br />
First published as a short story in 1959, and later as a novel, &quot;Algernon&quot; is a series of journal entries by a low-IQ laborer named Charlie Gordon who participates in experiments that triple his intelligence just as researchers did with a laboratory mouse named Algernon. As the protagonist reaches the height of his brainpower, the mouse's progress begins to reverse until he dies, a harbinger of what's to come for Charlie. The very makeup of the book's entries follows the ascension and decline of the main character, whose writings are filled with spelling and grammatical errors at the start, then soar to sophistication before regressing.<br />
<br />
The short story won a Hugo Award for best short fiction and the novel won a Nebula Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. The book has sold more than 5 million copies. Actor Cliff Robertson won an Academy Award for best leading actor with his portrayal of the book's main character in &quot;Charly,&quot; a 1968 movie based on the story.<br />
<br />
Keyes was born Aug. 9, 1927, in Brooklyn. He said he always wanted to be a writer but his parents dreamed of him becoming a doctor, and he enrolled in a premedical program at New York University. He wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Algernon, Charlie, And I,&quot; that adopting an unchosen vocation was &quot;driving a wedge between me and the people I love,&quot; feelings that planted the first seeds for his story, in which a major theme is the effect Charlie's intelligence has on his relationships.<br />
<br />
The author eventually became a public school teacher and he said &quot;Algernon&quot; would not have happened without the inspiration of a developmentally disabled boy who approached him and said, &quot;Mr. Keyes, I want to be smart,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography.<br />
<br />
Besides his most famous work and the autobiography, Keyes also wrote &quot;The Minds of Billy Milligan,&quot; ''Unveiling Claudia&quot; and several other books. &quot;Algernon,&quot; though to this day part of many schools' curricula, has also been frequently banned for some of its content, appearing as No. 43 on the American Library Association's 100 most frequently challenged books of the 1990s.<br />
<br />
Leslie Keyes said her father wrote to the very end, using a yellow pad he kept by his bedside. He is survived by another daughter, Hillary Keyes, and a sister, Gail Marcus.<br />
<br />
His wife, Aurea Vazquez, died last year.

<br />
Been thinking about this tech for a while now. No particular article or news story prompted this, it is just something that has been rummaging around my mind. <br />
<br />
Some of the good things - no wasted time during your commute. Take a nap or read a book. Less or No accidents. No mandatory insurance because if a human isn't driving then he can't be at fault. Gramma can still go out shopping and won't wreck her car. Heck, kids can now be chauffered by Google.<br />
<br />
The bad things include - No privacy about where you go. Talk about a dataminers wet dream. No mandatory insurance - lots of people will lose their jobs and rich people will lose their capital gains. Limits on where people can &quot;drive&quot; set arbitrarily or for profit. Need to keep people away from that G20 meeting, presto chango no one can drive near it. How easy would it be to disappear some one? As soon as victim enters car - doors lock and drive to warehouse. Imagine the chaos if the system went belly up during &quot;rush hour&quot;?<br />
<br />
Discuss.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I couldn't really figure out what to call the other thread either. Thread titles can be tough to come up with at times. I have gone back and forth about posting this here. <br />
<br />
A few of you already know this but I am terminally ill. I have Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis among other things wrong with me. I created a thread on the flight sim forums about it. It's a fairly long and detailed thread. If you are interested at all, at least read the first post. Please remember that the thread was started in November of 2012. According to what I have read, that 50% of the people with pulmonary fibrosis are dead within 2 years. So I am pretty sure I will be above average. At least unless things go really bad in the next couple of months. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://simhq.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/3799328/1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://simhq.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/3799328/1</a><br />
<br />
I have another PET/CT scan and PFT test on Monday. My pulmonologist told me on Thursday that my PET/CT scans keep showing some really ugly stuff but when they did the bronchoscopy it was a negative result. It didn't make a lot of sense to him. So this time if it shows up the same or worse, that they will probably do a medical biopsy. He is still concerned about cancer and on the last one, I had a node on my adrenal gland and he was upset my primary didn't follow up on it. He want's to look at that one too to see if it has changed at all. <br />
<br />
If you read the other thread, note that it was a progression over time, so look at the post dates. I tried to post my thoughts as honestly as I could. I will do my best to answer any questions anyone has. I am sure the first question will be &quot;Why am I posting this?&quot; <br />
<br />
I had told someone here and he told a couple of others. I am not upset that he did because his heart was in the right place. I am ok with that although immediately, I was upset, but got over it in a couple of hours. A few people from here went over there and posted in the thread and at that point I decided to let the thread die. (Pun Intended) I struggled a bit with the decision to post it here, but figured it would be better to be in control of how information is getting out. <br />
<br />
There is a lot of personal information in the other thread, but please don't use it in any negative way. I left it in because I wanted people to know it was real. It's an interesting read in my opinion. My state of mind is very clear in the thread and it hasn't changed. <br />
<br />
So I will leave it at that and don't hesitate to ask anything you want to know.<br />
<br />
Edit: Please no pity posts or I am sorry you are sick posts or anything like that. It's not why I posted it.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Rumor is this starts the 19th of June. In a couple days basically. The mystery cards from creating badges are already active, and this was an early sign of the sale appearing last year. <br />
<br />
It's happening a little earlier than I expected. While I did manage to finish all the stuff I got from the last one, I do still have Hitman: Absolution to play after getting it from Amazon for like $2 or something. I need the hard drive space so going to try and squeeze that in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anything in particular you guys are looking to pick up? I've been meaning to get The Banner Saga and The Walking Dead Season 2 for awhile, anything beyond that will depend on the discounts. I've skipped a few things in the past I want to get if the price is low enough.</div>

			Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner took a hard line Monday and refused to comply with a U.S. Supreme Court ruling ordering her to repay $1.5 billion of defaulted bonds.<br />
<br />
On national TV, she vowed not to submit to &quot;extortion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her announcement came hours after the justices in Washington refused to hear Argentina's appeal, and it could be a last effort to gain leverage ahead of a negotiated solution that both sides say they want. But with only days before a huge debt payment ordered by the court is due, many economists, analysts and politicians said the country's already fragile economy could be deeply harmed if she didn't immediately resolve the dispute.<br />
<br />
Refusing to comply with rulings that have been allowed to stand by the U.S. Supreme Court &quot;would be very damaging to the Argentine economy in the near future,&quot; said Miguel Kiguel, a former deputy finance minister and World Bank economist in the 1990s who runs the Econviews consulting firm in Buenos Aires.<br />
<br />
Argentine markets were already reflecting fear. The Merval stock index dropped 11 percent after the court decision, its largest one-day loss in more than six months, and the value of Argentina's currency plunged 33 percent on the black market.<br />
<br />
Fernandez urged her countrymen to &quot;remain tranquil&quot; in the days ahead.<br />
<br />
Bowing to the U.S. courts would force her to betray a core value that she and her late husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner, promoted since they took over the government in 2003: Argentina must maintain its sovereignty and economic independence at any cost.<br />
<br />
But a chorus of analysts said that if she complied with the ruling, it would become much easier for Argentina to borrow again, rebuilding its reserves and preventing the recession from getting even deeper.<br />
<br />
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Griesa order requires that $1.5 billion be paid &quot;all together, without quotas, right away, now, in cash, ahead of all the rest&quot; of bondholders, Fernandez said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This represents a profit of 1,608 percent, in dollars!&quot; she complained. &quot;I believe that in all of organized crime there has never been a case of a profit of 1,608 percent in such a short time.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Fernandez also said repeatedly that her government is ready to negotiate with the &quot;speculators&quot; who scooped up Argentine junk bonds after the country's 2001 default. Owners of more than 92 percent of the nearly worthless debt agreed to accept new bonds worth much less than their original face value, but investors led by New York billionaire Paul Singer held out and litigated instead, seeking to force Argentina to pay cash in full plus interest.<br />
<br />
Singer's NML Capital Ltd. has now won in the U.S. courts — and if Argentina doesn't hand over $907 million to the plaintiffs in the next two weeks, the judge will order U.S. banks not to process Argentina's June 30 payment totaling an equal amount to all the other bondholders.<br />
<br />
Fernandez said her government &quot;will not default on those who believed in Argentina.&quot; But analysts have questioned whether holders of restructured debt would accept payments outside the U.S. financial system.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some people say, 'Why don't you pay them and end all this right now?'&quot; the president said. &quot;It's because there's another problem, even more serious. There's another 7 percent who would be able to demand payment from Argentina, right away and now, of $15 billion. That's more than half the reserves in the Central Bank. As you can see, it's not only absurd but impossible that the country pays more than 50 percent of its reserves in a single payment to its creditors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's our obligation to take responsibility for paying our creditors, but not to become the victims of extortion by speculators,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
The plaintiffs said her government needs to settle now.<br />
<br />
&quot;The time has come for Argentina to enter into good-faith negotiations with holdout bondholders,&quot; said Richard Samp, an attorney for the Washington Legal Foundation who has acted as a spokesman for NML's position throughout the case. &quot;Argentina has expressed a desire to be permitted to re-enter financial markets around the world. The only way that it can do so is by coming to terms with its existing creditors.&quot;<br />
<br />
Refusing to comply was &quot;the best option&quot; among a series of grim alternatives that Cleary, Gottlieb, the U.S. law firm representing Argentina in Washington, presented to Fernandez ahead of the Supreme Court decision. That guidance suggested Argentina should default on all its debts before negotiating in order to gain more leverage.

			Over the past few months, we&#8217;ve seen a disturbing trend from first Kingston, and now PNY. Manufacturers are launching SSDs with one hardware specification, and then quietly changing the hardware configuration after reviews have gone out. The impacts have been somewhat different (more on that in a moment) but in both cases, unhappy customers are loudly complaining that they&#8217;ve been cheated, tricked into paying for a drive they otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have purchased.<br />
<br />
A blog post at Tweaktown details a reader&#8217;s unhappy experience with a new PNY Optima drive. This individual bought the drive expecting that it would feature a Silicon Motion controller, only to discover that the drive they purchased had a different firmware version and a different, SandForce-based controller. When Tweaktown inquired as to the situation, PNY sent back the following: &#8220;Yes we did ship some Optima SSD&#8217;s with SandForce controllers, but only if they meet the <u>minimum advertised performance levels</u> (in most of the benchmark tests, LSI controllers outperform SMI controllers).&#8221; (emphasis added)<br />
<br />
Practically, it&#8217;s not clear what &#8220;minimum advertised performance levels&#8221; means because PNY hasn&#8217;t actually advertised any apart from a spec sheet that says &#8220;up to 60,000 IOPS&#8221; with a footnote reading &#8220;*Performance based on PNY Internal tests using an IOMeter.&#8221; It&#8217;s not even clear if they mean Intel&#8217;s IOMeter program, or something else &#8212; and IOMeter can be configured to test a dizzying array of configuration options.<br />
<br />
The Tweaktown blog post doesn&#8217;t make clear what performance issues were observed, though it implies they exist. We have more concrete evidence with Kingston and its V300.<br />
<br />
<b>Kingston&#8217;s bait-and-switch</b><br />
<br />
Kingston&#8217;s V300 debuted well over a year ago to generally strong reviews &#8212; I covered the drive for PC Mag. This was a budget SSD family with a great price/performance ratio and one of the first budget drives that didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;Gotcha&#8221; in the performance department. At least, it didn&#8217;t have any initially &#8212; further analysis from websites like Anandtech and Nordichardware demonstrated that at some point, Kingston made the switch from synchronous to asynchronous NAND.<br />
<br />
..<br />
<br />
Synchronous NAND moves data on both the rising and falling edge of a clock signal, similar to DDR memory. Synchronous NAND use a clock signal, while asynchronous NAND&#8217;s performance is tied to a separate strobe (the RE signal above) that times read/write events separately from the data clock. In the future, asynchronous and synchronous NAND may actually operate at equivalent speeds due to other architecture changes, but for now asynchronous NAND is much, much slower than its counterpart.<br />
<br />
This can be seen in numerous tests run by websites like Nordichardware, and in Kingston&#8217;s own published documentation, which shows the V120S (the fast version) speeding past the asynchronous counterpart.<br />
<br />
..<br />
<br />
Kingston, to be sure, doesn&#8217;t see it that way &#8212; the company has released a statement previously saying: &#8220;If the drive is tested with ATTO Benchmark the speed results should meet or exceed advertised specifications which is officially 450MB/s read and write.&#8221;<br />
<br />
This is akin to saying: &#8220;Both Kingston SSDs should reach approximately the same velocity when fired out of a cannon,&#8221; at least as far as real-world drive performance is concerned. The reason many publications have moved away from ATTO is precisely because it&#8217;s such a meaningless test. It&#8217;s meaningless enough, in fact, that Kingston&#8217;s own data charts show enormous performance differences between the two products.<br />
<br />
<b>Imagine this in other contexts</b><br />
<br />
hookImagine buying a high-end Core i7 or AMD CPU, opening the box, and finding a midrange part sitting there with an asterisk and the label &#8220;Performs Just Like Our High End CPU In Single-Threaded SuperPi!&#8221;<br />
<br />
Anybody want a 300-500W PSU? How about a GTX 770ish from Nvidia?<br />
<br />
Somehow, I think not. In any other context, this kind of substitution would be utterly unacceptable. The fact that SSDs are far faster than hard drives (Kingston actually references this as an excuse) is not an excuse. It&#8217;s not clear yet if the PNY drive controller shift is hitting performance as significantly as Kingston&#8217;s NAND swap, but this is a trend that needs to stop, now. The SSD market is cutthroat these days, but that means the last thing a company wants to do is scare people off its own hardware.<br />
<br />
If reviewers can&#8217;t trust that the performance they see is the performance end-users will receive, they&#8217;ll never recommend your components. Quoting terrible benchmarks that don&#8217;t test anything worth testing or providing utterly impenetrable performance claims is not the way to build trust in a brand. Even when benchmark performance is equal, controller changes can cause different reliability results. This question is difficult enough without behind-the-scenes hardware changes.

			<title>Nordic Games buys THQ name to use when publishing</title>

			&quot;Published by THQ&quot; may not be an extinct phrase after all. Nordic Games, the surprise buyer of a whole load of THQ games at auction, has acquired the publisher's name with the intention of releasing games under it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was kind of surprise to some industry veterans and players that we were the winner of the auction of the THQ titles,&quot; Nordic Games general manager Klemens Kruezer told Polygon.<br />
<br />
&quot;The challenging fact is nobody has ever heard about Nordic Games before [the THQ auction]. There were so many articles with the headlines 'Who the f*** is Nordic Games?' [that] we said, 'Okay they were right.'<br />
<br />
&quot;We have seen an uplift in the name of Nordic Games, and what we have also done is we have made a second deal with THQ where we bought the THQ trademark.&quot;<br />
<br />
Among the games Nordic bought from THQ were Darksiders and Red Faction. Darksiders is the biggest draw, and apparently Nordic is constantly asked what it will do with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is where we need some more patience from the fans, because we want to be able to do it right,&quot; answered Kruezer. &quot;The owner of Nordic Games has given [interviews] where he has said that he doesn't want to make a shitty sequel.&quot;<br />
<br />
More announcements are apparently planned for Gamescom.<br />
<br />
Nordic Games is relatively young (established 2011) Austrian company that built a business on acquiring brands from defunct publishers JoWooD and DreamCatcher (and it used their labels in the same way it intends to use THQ's).<br />
<br />
Nordic is reviving MX vs. ATV this year with Supercross, the first video of which was aired at E3. It's being developed by a team of former MX vs. ATV devs in the US.
