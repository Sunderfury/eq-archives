		<div>This looks like the best wizard upgrade in an expansion in awhile.  Still it doesn't bring us up to top level dps.  Currently on parses I am coming out a little above the bards on straight burns.  This might give me the chance to get up to monk level but rog, bsk and rng still leave me in the dust.  Last parse I think I did 44k damage while the top ranger did 145k.  Monks were around 58k.  I could probably squeeze more dps out by nuking harder, faster at the beginning of the fight and just trust the tanks to keep aggro.<br />
<br />
I have to say that while we don't get the snare upgrade the rest of the spells and AA look like an improvement over what we have now.</div>

As a raiding wizard, I find some rather large holes in your argument.  Specifically, you don't use all of these spells in a raid (telakisz is a glaring example, and I rarely.. scratch that - NEVER - use claw of vox in a raid setting).  It seems to me at least, the non raiding spells should have their efficiency increased.  And perhaps rather than a damage increase (or better - in ADDITION to a damage increase), the casting times on the 'raid' type spells should be reduced.</div>

The 0.01 fluctuation is probably an oversight and can be fixed. And it won't make any real difference.<br />
<br />
We got some spells that have no use on raids (or no use at all - like the lure rain) as a continuation of the existing PoP/OoW lines. Those are singular aberrations and don't affect the general picture.<br />
<br />
If you don't use Claw of Vox on raids today - that is probably because you have Chaos Flame (and please don't say you don't use that spell on raids) and there are no raid mobs that would be more resistant to fire than cold and require extra long time to kill. I currently don't cast ANY non-fire nukes except several casts that are required by design of 2 specific events (Suchun and Devlin). But it only means that raid designers have been lacking imagination. We still need nukes of all 3 types in case they start making events that require them.<br />
<br />
I agree that having spells with shorter casting times and better DPM would be nice, but that's just another dimension that doesn't have to be a part of the tiered spell system. SOE got a good thing started, and it will evolve with time. There is always more to want, but it's impossible to get everything at once.</div>

			<div><strong>Couple questions</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>These questions are to those who participated in the beta:<br />
<br />
1) Why were rarely to never used spells continued?   Did the devs not get this feedback, did they not believe the feedback, or do they believe these have use?<br />
<br />
2) I hear the new resist system got &quot;postponed&quot; at the last second.   Does this last second change help or hurt wizard DPS?     Was the spell design put in place with the new resist system in mind?   Were mob resists tweaked with the new resist system in mind?<br />
<br />
3) I have read Qaman's post on &quot;theoretical&quot; numbers for wizard DPS.    The question is: how do wizard fair relative to other DPS focused classes?    How do they do in encounters lasting less than a min, 1 - 3 min, 3 - 6 mins, and sustained?   I ask this because I read some results on the everquest forums and I am uncertain as to validity but I am concerned if it is even half true.</div>

		<div>There are a lot of spell lines and they get lots of feedback, most of what we kept was pretty decent, and some things are just going to be 'niche' type spells. Not always a bad thing, sometimes there are places where you can really use them. As long as they aren't the majority, I don't think it is a big worry.<br />
<br />
The numbers I posted aren't something anyone would have experienced in beta because they require equipment that wasn't available. You should be able to chain cast pretty much in the 1-6 minute range, after that it starts dropping off a lot.<br />
<br />
Since they were messing with the resist system a lot in beta, and still haven't finished with it, it is really hard to say how it will affect us except theoretically. Basically, it curves more so you should be able to hit things with high resists easier than before, but some things with lower resists will resist a bit more. Since they have been trying to adjust values on older content to keep it about the same and those values are still going live, right now some things may actually be easier to hit than they were before.<br />
<br />
Of course, this will apply to players as well, high resists won't really guarantee immunity anymore. But hard to say exactly how much impact atm.</div>

Not sure how much people would want that, but I find I am the best chance for invis in a lot of the groups I am in.

They don't really look at it that way because you can't have more than 1 of a tier at a time, and it will always be the highest ranked spell that you have gotten. So doing what you would suggest would actually cause problems.<br />

There is a second tier of invis coming that will make a lot of those obsolete Edimas. It was pulled to give them more time to work on the system.</div>

		<div>No problems.  Just a matter of who will get which spells.  If the Tier3 spell is slightly less efficient then it will probably be balanced out by the focus effect that the raiding person would have over the grouping person.  In this case it is a matter of focus for the person getting it.  If you group a lot more than you raid then it might be worth it to you to stop at the Tier2 version and never scribe the Tier3.  If it is the other way around you are looking for bang more than efficiency so staying with Tier2 would not be in your best interest.<br />
<br />
I am also not talking about massive changes either.  Figure a couple mana/damage adjustment could be enough to make a sizable difference over sustained time frames.<br />
<br />
For the most part it does not make much difference until we can play with the new spells and aggro reduction tools to see where we fit in.  I suspect once the resist changes go into effect we will see less complete resists, but lots more partial resists.  Hopefully aggro will no longer be our biggest block any longer and now it is a matter of how much we can cast in X period of time.  I will be happy if I see more of other classes names in the HoTT box than just Edimas.  Then we can play with those parses and see just what we can chain cast for improved DPS.</div>

		<div>I was just about to respond to the numbers thread, then I started thinking and believe it would be better here.  Just noticed something though.<br />
<br />
Since they took out leap of flame, do we get any efficient &quot;little&quot; fire nuke above level 70, as an upgrade to chaos flame?  I didn't see one.<br />
<br />
If not, then if we want to be efficient with fire we'll have to use both the level 70 chaos flame and the level 70 ether flame, since GGoM won't proc off of chaos flame to use with EC.  Is this intended, in order to force us into using a combination of the new cold nuke for efficiency with the big fire nuke?<br />
<br />
In this regard, since the new concussion is the proper level, takes mana to cast and has a casting time, will it proc the new GoM?</div>

		<div>from my interpretation all that the new gom does is allow gom to proc off and be used by lvl 71to 75 spells.  There is not an old gom and a new gom.  they are the same gom and this simply allows u to use spells over 70.  That means u can still use chaos flame to proc gom and then use the new big nuke</div>

The tiering is a complete joke, why do the spells NOT get more efficient, mightaswell use tier1 Sothgars for all it matters, better DPM when combined with the new EF for about 60 less DPS.<br />
<br />
I just hope we're going to see some upgrades in gear, im extremely concerned by lack of foci upgrades in spdat atm, though that can be easily fixed. Maybe we'll eventually get crit gear, or ancient spells if added will actually be better than tier1, though if the Prat is still doing spells im very skeptical.</div>

No Atol's upgrade but theres shouldn't be much of a difference in resist rates post 70. I doubt we would get a chromatic version though in any case.</div>

Edited: NM, I see what you mean. Using SF1 with EC3 (assuming GoM procs with 10% chance) is 5.82 DPM while SF3+EC3 is 5.75 DPM. Should ask Prathun to increase DPM on rank 3.</div>

It's not at no DPM cost though, rank1 is 3.5% MORE efficient with GoM and new EF taken into account<br />

Edit: Ooops, something was wrong with my spreadsheet, is only 0.8% difference which i guess is negligible, still ridiculous that they dont gain any efficiency though</div>

Well, we need to define the context for those % of course :)  <br />
5.82 / 5.75 = 1.01<br />
5.82 - 5.75 = 0.07<br />
<br />
SF3 should do 5147 damage to be on par with SF1 when used with EC3 (which is definitely how it's going to be used).<br />
<br />
Similar adjustments need to be made to SF2 for use with EC2, and for Icefall Avalanche and Ball Lightning 2 and 3 for EC2 and EC3 respectively.</div>

		<div>Well, I was just looking at the spreadsheet I have for average endgame numbers since I had it handy. With EC and Crits and Focus, SF3 is 14.27 DPM and SF1 is 14.42 DPM on average. So the context I was using was just the 14.42/14.27 method since that should stay the same for comparison purposes, even though the absolute one would obviously be different depending on what you were doing. Numbers are going to be a bit off until we figure out how the Specialization stuff changed, Maddoc said he made it actually work with small changes instead of needing large ones.<br />
<br />
I think the real question is how they look at things I guess, because it isn't always the same way as we do. If you consider the calculations seperately, they look fine, its only when you put them together that you see the problem.</div>

I've just found a HUGE problem with cutting Leap of Flame from the set that went in and/or not getting a Chaos Flame upgrade. The @#$%!#% greedy implementation of GoM/GoRM!! Even after paying 9 AA for that piece of @#$% GoRM, Chaos Flame still only procs GoM - which cannot be used for lv 71+ spells!!! :mad: And we have no small fire-based nuke to proc GoRM in sustained DPS mode. This completely screws up the standard raiding nuke mode (Chaos Flame, drop a big bomb for GoM) for lv 71+. This needs to be fixed! If anything, make a carbon copy of Chaos Flame and flag it WIZ/71 - that will do it.</div>

Even after paying 9 AA for that piece of @#$% GoRM, Chaos Flame still only procs GoM - which cannot be used for lv 71+ spells!!! :mad: And we have no small fire-based nuke to proc GoRM in sustained DPS mode. This completely screws up the standard raiding nuke mode (Chaos Flame, drop a big bomb for GoM) for lv 71+. This needs to be fixed! If anything, make a carbon copy of Chaos Flame and flag it WIZ/71 - that will do it.</div>

I dont see it as a problem really,  just proc GoRM with Claw of Selay...its better then CF anyway.  And to get that Pyro proc on, you can still use CF , ACF, etc...</div>

Claw of Selay is slower casting than Chaos Flame (too slow to use on a raid compared to CF), and it's on a different resist (resistant mobs happen, and usually if any 1 resist is debuffed on a raid it's fire because all DPS casters have fire nukes).</div>

I've had no problems so far just chaining Corona Flare as fast as I can.  It only takes 30 seconds for OOC to kick in and you regen like 4% a tick at that point.  Aggro also a non-issue.  The new concussion is crazy good.</div>

<br />
Not sure that reasoning makes sense though, GoM gets a boost from the level being raised because the new spells are better whereas Pyro doesn't actually change at all. I don't really have a problem with them adding in an upgrade, just with the way the upgrade works. It really should just encompass the previous version because of the simple fact that not all spell lines get upgraded at once because of the way the expansion cycles work. Having 2 different versions because of that just causes needless problems.</div>

Also some gems popping early and you think they are ready but when you cast instead of getting a not ready message you just fizzle repeatedly?</div>
