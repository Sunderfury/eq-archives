			A US senator has suggested that restaurants should not have to make their employees wash their hands after toilet visits.<br />
<br />
Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, made the comments on Monday during a speech criticising business regulations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let them decide&quot; such issues, the newly elected lawmaker said.<br />
<br />
His argument was that restaurants which did not require workers to wash their hands would quickly go out of business.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I think it's good to illustrate the point, that that's the sort of mentality we need to have to reduce the regulatory burden on this country,&quot; Mr Tillis said.<br />
<br />
He suggested that restaurants that did not require hand washing would have to alert customers with prominently displayed signs - itself a regulation.<br />
<br />
Mr Tillis stood by his comments when interviewed later at the US Capitol.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes there are regulations that maybe we want to set a direction, but then let those who are regulated decide whether or not it makes sense,&quot; Mr Tillis told the Associated Press news agency.<br />
<br />
&quot;They might pay a huge price,&quot; he said, but &quot;they get to make that decision versus government.&quot;<br />
<br />
The comments come as some Republican presidential hopefuls have questioned vaccine regulations amid a measles outbreak.<br />
<br />
At least two hopefuls have said parents are justified in sometimes having their children avoid vaccinations generally required for attending schoo
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>There is an LOL cat for this somewhere.<br />
<br />
What is with this insanity lately from the GOP in general where they pick at every minor regulation and claim we do not need them because the free market will sort it out?   Have they not seen oh lets just say the pollution in China?  that is what happens when you let the free market sort things out.</div>

<br />

		<hr />
		
			<b>TOKYO — In Japan, where conformity takes precedence over individuality, one of the most important values is to avoid “meiwaku” — causing trouble for others. And sympathy aside, the two Japanese purportedly slain by the Islamic State group are now widely viewed as troublemakers. </b><br />
<br />
So is Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Many Japanese feel that if the hostages had not ignored warnings against travel to Syria, or if Abe had not showcased Tokyo’s support for the multinational coalition against the Islamic State militants, Japan wouldn’t have been exposed to this new sense of insecurity and unwelcomed attention from Islamic extremists.<br />
<br />
“To be honest, they caused tremendous trouble to the Japanese government and to the Japanese people. In the old days, their parents would have had to commit hara-kiri (ritual suicide) to apologize,” said Taeko Sakamoto, a 64-year-old part-time worker, after first expressing sympathy over the deaths of Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa.<br />
<br />
Sakamoto also sees Abe as part of the problem, for not being more mindful of the risks at a time when he had already been pushing to expand Japan’s military role, which is limited to its own self-defense under the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution after its defeat in World War II.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want Mr. Abe to do anything else that may be seen as provocation, because that’s what would put us at a greater risk,” Sakamoto said.<br />
<br />
Japan until recently had not become directly involved in the violence surrounding Islamic State militants, who now control about a third of Syria and neighboring Iraq. Days after Abe announced during a Middle East trip last month that Japan would give $200 million in non-military aid to support the fight against Islamic State, the militants demanded a $200 million ransom for the two hostages.<br />
<br />
The hostage crisis came to a grisly end with news Sunday that Goto, a journalist, had been beheaded by the extremists. The killing of Yukawa was announced earlier.<br />
<br />
In the video posted on militant websites that purportedly shows Goto’s slaying, a man says, “Abe, because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war, this knife will not only slaughter Kenji, but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found. So let the nightmare for Japan begin.”<br />
<br />
Abe has been adamant about his commitment to fight terrorism as part of an international effort. On Thursday, Japan’s lower house, the more powerful of the two parliamentary chambers, unanimously endorsed a resolution condemning the Islamic State group’s “beyond dastardly act of terrorism” against the two Japanese nationals.<br />
<br />
In the resolution, Japan also vowed to expand humanitarian support for the Middle East and Africa, and to strengthen anti-terrorism efforts with the international community.<br />
<br />
Japan’s tensions with other countries have been largely limited to its neighbors China and South Korea. The Middle East is an unfamiliar, distant, dangerous place.<br />
<br />
“That’s where the two men dared to go and that’s probably why many people see them causing trouble,” said Koichi Nakano, international politics professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.<br />
<br />
The public’s response to the hostages was chilly from the beginning. Few seemed to sympathize with Yukawa, a 42-year-old gun aficionado and adventurer who was taken hostage in August. Media attention toward his case quickly faded and he was largely forgotten until Jan. 20, when militants made their ransom demand in a video that showed Yukawa and Goto in orange gowns and kneeling beside a masked militant.<br />
<br />
Goto’s reputation as a veteran journalist whose reports focused on children and refugees in war-torn areas won him more sympathy and small rallies by his friends and other supporters. According to his wife and others who had spoken with him, Goto had gone to Syria late last year to try to save Yukawa.<br />
<br />
Still, to address the “meiwaku” problem, both victims’ families apologized repeatedly to the government and the people for “the trouble” their sons caused, even after they died.<br />
<br />
Just two days after Abe’s office put a national flag at half-staff to mourn for the pair, a senior member of his ruling party cast Goto as a troublemaker, not a tragic hero.<br />
<br />
Masahiko Komura, vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party, said Wednesday that Goto ignored the government’s repeated warnings against his trip to Syria.<br />
<br />
“I must say that was reckless courage, not true courage, no matter how high his aspirations might have been,” Komura told reporters, reminding them not to cause trouble by following Goto’s path.<br />
<br />
Criticizing the dead in public is extremely rare in Japan, and Komura’s comment reflects how individuals are expected to act in line with the national interest.<br />
<br />
When three young Japanese were taken hostage in Iraq and later freed in 2004, they faced nationwide bashing as troublemakers. They had to cover their own medical examinations and part of their chartered flights home.<br />
<br />
Some critics accuse the government of promoting the “self-responsibility” idea as a way to shirk its own responsibility to protect Japanese citizens.<br />
<br />
“It’s a dangerous trend and we must watch,” said Taku Sakamoto, a journalist and Middle East expert.<br />
<br />
While Abe, his party’s lawmakers and other nationalists say the terrorist threat justifies Abe’s push for a tougher military posture, others say it is exactly that sort of policy that is putting Japan at greater risk of attack.<br />
<br />
“The hostage crisis is causing a tremendous impact on Japanese society, and has polarized views about which direction Japan should go in terms of national security,” said Nakano, the professor. “In a way, people saw what could happen under Abe’s security policy.”<br />
<br />
Some Japanese, like Toshihiko Ozeki, a 67-year-old pensioner, say Japan should be strong enough to defend itself, and that he supports Abe’s push to expand Japan’s defense role.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Abe has gone a bit too far, trying to make Japan look tough,” said a 55-year-old man who would provide only his family name, Arai, because he is afraid of being targeted by the Islamic militants. “We don’t want to be seen in that image, and we don’t want to have anything to do with combat.”

I wonder if LBB could sidestep the ruling by moving to Canada and then selling to the shops as a Canadian operation and exploit the free trade agreements.</div>

			Tolkien lore led a Texas boy to suspension after he brought his “one ring” to school.<br />
<br />
Kermit Elementary School officials called it a threat when the 9-year-old boy, Aiden Steward, in a playful act of make-believe, told a classmate he could make him disappear with a ring forged in fictional Middle Earth’s Mount Doom.<br />
<br />
“It sounded unbelievable,” the boy’s father, Jason Steward, told the Daily News. He insists his son “didn’t mean anything by it.”<br />
<br />
The Stewards had just watched “The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies” days earlier, inspiring Aiden’s imagination and leading him to proclaim that he had in his possession the one ring to rule them all.<br />
<br />
“Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly,” Steward said.<br />
<br />
Aiden claimed Thursday he could put a ring on his friend's head and make him invisible like Bilbo Baggins, who stole Gollum’s &quot;precious&quot; in J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings.”<br />
<br />
<b>“I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence,” the boy's father later wrote in an email. &quot;If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.&quot;</b><br />
<br />
Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the fourth-grader’s suspension, citing confidentiality policies, according to the Odessa American, who first reported Aiden’s troubles Friday.<br />
<br />
The family moved to the Kermit Independent School District only six months ago, but it’s been nothing but headaches for Aiden. He’s already been suspended three times this school year.<br />
<br />
Two of the disciplinary actions this year were in-school suspensions for referring to a classmate as black and bringing his favorite book to school: &quot;The Big Book of Knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
“He loves that book. They were studying the solar system and he took it to school. He thought his teacher would be impressed,” Steward said.<br />
<br />
But the teacher learned the popular children’s encyclopedia had a section on pregnancy, depicting a pregnant woman in an illustration, he explained.<br />

Is Rod Serling around?<br />
<br />
&quot;They're out of toilet paper...in a little place called...the Men's Room.&quot;<br />
<br />
What in the actual fuck?<br />
<br />
Now we're going to have tons of creepy guys lining up behind the cash registers with the 15 year old girls working their first job?<br />
<br />
How could this POSSIBLY have occurred to anyone as a good idea?<br />
<br />
I'm all for the hippie free love and hugging out an argument and whatnot (I blame all of the Renaissance and Pagan festivals I was booked at over the years) but how is this, in any way, going to NOT end badly?</div>

			 The daughter of the late singer Whitney Houston was taken to a hospital Saturday morning after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub at her Georgia home.. <br />
<br />
Bobbi Kristina Houston Brown, the daughter of Houston and R&amp;B singer Bobby Brown, was discovered in the bathroom by her husband, Nick Gordon, and a friend, about 10:20 a.m., said  Lisa Holland, spokeswoman for the Roswell Police Department.<br />
<br />
The 21-year-old, who is Houston’s only child, was taken to North Fulton Hospital in Roswell, a suburb outside of Atlanta. She is currently “still alive and breathing,” Holland said.<br />
<br />
Police are obtaining a search warrant to look through the home and are talking to friends and family, Holland said.<br />
<br />
Feb. 11 will be the third anniversary of Houston’s death. She was found unresponsive in the bathtub of her room at the Beverly Hilton. Whitney Houston was 48.<br />
<br />
Brown was hospitalized a day after her mother’s death, reportedly for stress. In a March 2012 interview with Oprah, Brown said she was still dealing with the grief of her mother’s death.<br />
<br />
“Sometimes it’s so surreal,” Brown said in the interview. “I still walk into the house like, ‘Mom?’ But I’ve accepted it.”<br />
<br />
Brown inherited her mother’s entire estate.<br />
<br />
Last January, Brown married Gordon. The marriage was criticized by some because Gordon was informally adopted by Houston. The couple was engaged once before in 2012, but it didn’t seem to please the family, according to Times archives. That engagement was called off a month later. By July 2013, they were engaged again.<br />
<br />
Brown defended the engagement in a Facebook post at the time, saying, “I’m tired of hearing people say ‘eww your engaged to your brother or if Whitney was still alive would we be together or would she approve of this.’”<br />
<br />
Some celebrities have taken to social media to express their angst over the situation.<br />
<br />
Actress Jada Pinkett Smith wrote on her Facebook page: “Let’s puts some prayers, light and love out there towards the daughter of our beloved Whitney Houston… Bobbi Kristina… pain can be a hell of a thing.”<br />
<br />
“Prayers for Bobbi Kristina,” tweeted R&amp;B singer Ciara, who’s been vocal about Houston’s impact on her career. <br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Okay,<br />
<br />
10 years ago, I would say that Ghostbusters 2 was a travesty. <br />
<br />
I've only seen it 3 times. I never really cared for it, and felt it cheapened its original. <br />
<br />
Last night, both were on Bravo, and I found myself having much more fun quoting the sequel line after line than I ever did the original. <br />
<br />
I would say the whole mythos and lore and natural progression of the first film makes it a far more enjoyable story, overall, than its sequel, but some of the laughs in the sequel are so much more enjoyable, although campy as they are, it is fantastic fun.<br />
<br />
The sequel's story and plot development, which likely could be in large due to its editing, is awful. Too many things go completely unexplained (Which might be okay, as it is a comedy, at its heart), but its characters all shine extremely well (with exception, maybe to Winston, who seems a little bit boring, and even more confusing of how he was resourced for his presence between beginning and middle). <br />
<br />
My favorite aspect of the film's comedy is its anti-hero, Janosz Poha (could he be the worst definiiton of an anti-hero?) played by Peter MacNicol. <br />

			PORTLAND, Ore. -- Oregon is known for specialty beers. But what about a beer made with sewer water?<br />
<br />
It's what some local home-brewers will be doing this summer.<br />
<br />
Jeremie Landers will be one of them. He's been home-brewing for nearly a decade.<br />
<br />
He's even converted the garage of his North Portland home into a taproom.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love the experimentation process,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Which is why this summer, Landers will be one of more than a dozen local home brewers taking part in a unique experiment.<br />
<br />
Instead of using normal tap water to make their beer, the brewers will be using what was once sewer water.<br />
<br />
The water comes straight from the treatment plant.<br />
<br />
It's all part of a competition Washington County's Clean Water Services is putting on to demonstrate different uses for its recycled water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there another use we can use for it to meet our long-term water needs? Oregon needs to be thinking about that,&quot; said Mark Jockers with Clean Water Services.<br />
<br />
The agency says a special purification system is able to make sewer water even cleaner than your typical drinking water.<br />
<br />
&quot;The water that comes from the high purity water system is the cleanest water on the planet,&quot; said Jockers.<br />
<br />
And when it comes to making beer, the purer the water, the better the brew.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're starting with absolute zero you can add a lot more in and get a lot more creativity with it then, let's say, you were using Bull Run water,&quot; explained Landers.<br />
<br />
It's been jokingly called &quot;sewage brewage.&quot;<br />
<br />
But don't expect to be finding the beverage on store shelves anytime soon.<br />
<br />
The competition this summer is just for fun.<br />
<br />
The Department of Environmental Quality allows recycled water to be used for drinking purposes, but only if it goes through a specific process that includes approval from state and national agencies, as well as a public hearing. State officials told KGW the brewers are following this process.
