Assuming nothing changes the current treasury will cover 20 months of hosting. However please note that we may need to pay to update/replace the board software in the near future.<br />
<br />
(Since people will ask, I am letting the debt go unpaid, but won't be donating any more money to Graffes in the near future. :grinyes: )<br />
<br />
Do people want me to update this monthly? Do you want a pdf of the Linode invoice?<br />
<br />
Incidentally, one of the upsides of Linode is they send the invoice to both me and Nadiar, so there is a check there that I am not fudging the books.</div>
