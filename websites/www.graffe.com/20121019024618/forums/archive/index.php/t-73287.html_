<br />
At least, that's quickly becoming my only real option at this point.<br />
<br />
History behind this statement.  Was married three years ago.  Due to some difference of opinions, we were forced to split up and dissolve the marriage.  I moved out, she kept the house. Within weeks it became apparent that she was unable to keep up with the house payments.<br />
<br />
The housing market was in it's first stages of collapsing, so you can see where this is going.  She managed to sell the house, but at a $30K loss.  We had an 80/20 loan and managed to fully pay the primary lender, but the secondary wouldn't agree to release her from the debt.  They did, however, unsecure the loan from the house.  A few months later, she declares bankruptcy.  I hear nothing more about it; not from her, not from the lender.  Nobody tries to contact me.<br />
<br />
Flash forward to today.  I've been saving for a few years now and have managed to put away a sizable amount to purchase my own home.  Something modest and affordable on my single man's income.  However, it seems no lender will talk to me.  Mainly because nowhere during the divorce proceedings nor during the sale of the house was my name struck from the loan.  <br />
<br />
I'll be the first to admit that it's partially my fault.  I should have thought of it early, I should have fought to get my name removed from the loan if she was keeping the house, and I should have consulted a financial adviser.  I really can't blame anything else, other than perhaps I wasn't thinking straight at the time and just wanted to move on with my life after being dumped by someone I thought I knew and trusted.  Doesn't change the fact that I'm sorely pissed off at the situation.  <br />
<br />
The problem now is that I'm responsible for 30 thousand dollars of debt that I simply cannot pay.  Maybe the creditor will take a settlement.  I have to fill out some hardship package which delves into every financial facet of my life and tears it apart.  Best case scenario, even if they'll take a settlement, is that my entire savings is wiped out and I start over.  Worst case is that I spend a few years paying on something I no longer own.  <br />
<br />
I figure if I'm letting some stranger access all my bank accounts and personal history, I might as well make it my lawyer and tell the creditor they're getting nothing.  I have student loans that would love to see my savings.  I can either settle and spend two years rebuilding my money, or declare and spend two years repairing my credit.  Seems about equal to me, except latter has the bonus of paying off student debt.<br />
<br />
The most excellent part?  I still get to talk to the ex-wife a few times a week, as we have kids.  Her version of an apology for this was - &quot;Oh, I'm sorry.  Hey, can you pick up the kids early?  I have an appointment with my marriage counselor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Astute readers my not a distinct lack of curse words.  I apologize for that.  I offer you a consolation 'fuck'.</div></div><hr />

That's what your creditors call it when they themselves do it to restructure or avoid paying their own bills.<br />
<br />
Also -- I second Jonas' suggestion.</div></div><hr />

Bad advice, your safe deposit box can be levied on by a sheriff.</div></div><hr />

Put it in a jar and bury it in the Wooly swamp!</div></div><hr />

I'd be working very hard at showing a net cash value of $0 right now.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Bad advice for when you have to answer &quot;where did the money go?&quot;<br />
<br />
It does sound like you are getting seriously screwed on this deal.  Come out ahead, put the money on your student loans and file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alikat Astrae</div><div class="date">April 23rd, 2012, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the advice I WOULD give IF I was the kind of naughty person who would suggest illegal activities: <br />
<br />
Take a trip to either Nevada or Atlantic City, whichever is cheaper.  While you're there, go to a branch of your bank and withdraw your savings, and then go and blow 10% of it at MULTIPLE casinos.  Get lots of receipts for your hotel stay, food, and travel expenses, and then, when they ask &quot;What happened to that money you had in the bank,&quot; tell them that you were trying to hit a big win so you could pay off your debts.  Bury the 90% remaining cash in a sealed Mason jar, and in several years, when the dust has cleared from your bankruptcy settlement, dig up the jar, schedule another casino-hopping trip, and the following tax return declare the 90% of your remaining savings as gambling winnings on your income taxes.  Yes, you will lose another small percentage of that money in income taxes, but the remainder will be effectively laundered and legally yours to do with as you please.<br />
 <br />
Now, that would be what I would advise IF I WAS  NAUGHTY PERSON.  Whatever you do, DO NOT DO WHAT I SAID ABOVE.  Because it would be wrong!  And I would NEVER advise anyone to do something illegal.  This post was just for casual purposes of abstract discussion, no practical advice in implied or intended.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alikat Astrae</div><div class="date">April 23rd, 2012, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which is why you don't claim to have won any single pot or jackpot in excess of $600, but instead just won steadily at small bids and small jackpots.  You simply enter the income on your Schedule C and declare it as gambling winnings.  The 1099 is just to catch you if you DON'T declare it such a win.  You just declare your aggregate gambling winnings on a single line, there is no breakdown for individual wins.</div></div><hr />

(Additionally, federal taxes allow you to subtract the amount of your wager before considering the prize for tax, for what it's worth.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you go for complete bankruptcy and get placed under curatorship /a Ward, make sure you have yourself a place to stay/rent first where you are comfortable. And make sure you have signed some long term rental/subscription contracts on (luxury) utilities like TV, Internet, newspaper and magazines you might need the next 5 years you will have no private income and will be paying off debts. They can not easily take away obligations you can defend, but they can easily deny you getting new ones.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
This is actually not a horrible idea if you do the &quot;hide the cash&quot; thing.  I still think you would be further ahead dropping it on your student loans though.</div></div><hr />

No Dmitry bullshit, bankruptcy is a specialty within the law and a good bankruptcy attorney can really help you prepare for the process and much better protect your assets than silly random &quot;buy gold and bury it&quot; &quot;gamble and hide winnings&quot; schemes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a consultation meeting with a bankruptcy attorney beginning of next week.  The creditor is unwilling to settle unless I give them complete access to my financial life, and that simply is not going to happen.  Screw that.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I own very little else, so even if I declare, it's not like they can walk into my home and take anything of value.</div></div><hr />
