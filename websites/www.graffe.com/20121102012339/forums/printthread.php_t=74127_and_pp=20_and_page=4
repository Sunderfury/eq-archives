			<div class="message">I wonder what the tax burden of those who do not pay income taxes really is. It is convenient to talk only income tax and then ignore all of the other taxes they do pay - FICA, Gas, Property, Sales. There are many taxes, it would be interesting to see a roll-up of how much Tax each income group pays on average. Sure, the wealthy pay a lions share of Income taxes - but how do the rest of the taxes play out and what is the real burden?</div>

		<blockquote class="restore">So is the &quot;Payroll&quot; taxes indicated in their calculation at the bottom the FICA Taxes?  Because SSI/Medicare is +8% for all income below $108K.<br />
Is the &quot;Average Cash income&quot; factoring in that those in the top 1% make their money via capital gains, which has a maximum tax rate of 15%.<br />
<br />
So minus 10-15% Top 1% tax rate = 14-19% effective tax rate<br />
Bottom 90% + FICA = 24-37% Effective Tax rates<br />
<br />
It claims to factor in sales tax as well, is that a factor based on total income spent on purchased goods, because we know that most of those in the bottom 90% spend almost 100% of their income.</blockquote>

</div>It's kind of amazing how many people don't realize this.<br />
<br />
The problem is if you look at those non-Federal Taxes and break them into two categories: necessary and unnecessary.  Presume that we're all going to pay ~1/3 of our income towards rent or a home.  That 1/3 includes basic utilities and property taxes.  That leaves around 36% for &quot;other&quot;  Some volume of that is food, but food has a base cost and only very minor scaling.  Excluding Luxury Meals we might splurge for like Christmas, If it costs $10000/year to eat, the Rich might pay up to $20,000.  So food costs scale from &gt;100% of their extra income for the bottom 20%, to 1.5% for the top 1%, and even if the 4th 20% paid for the &quot;rich&quot; food they'd be paying less than 30%.   While we might spend the same %'s overall, the rich are paying most of their % optionally.  Meaning if they decide to live a little frugally, they save huge sums of money.  The poor can't do that.</blockquote>

	</div>
</div>And the reason that taxes absolutely should be progressive is that you use more of the government services to create and protect your wealth the more wealth you have.  You use the roads/courts/school system...more because you have more and the higher you get the more of these things you need to keep insulating and protecting that wealth.  When was the last time you went to court? (Unless you are a lawyer like our gnome friend) When was the last time you required heavy infrastructure to move your goods from place to place?  How many vehicles do you put on the road every day to help facilitate your wealth.<br />
<br />
If there isn't a progressive tax rate, then all those services are an entitlement to the rich.  Corporate and tax loopholes to the rich cost us more at federal/state/local levels of government than low income tax credits and the other &quot;entitlements&quot;.</blockquote>

<br />
But for some reason he and the vast majority of the GOP elites are happy to pay 10% and lip service to their churches because they recognize the value those churches have given their stellar careers, but they refuse to pay their NATION its due and necessary taxes and behave as if they have gotten no boost to their careers due to the public sector that they claim to despise.  They revere their churches and they denigrate their nation with the same mouths, and pay tithes without complaint but behave as if every dollar in taxes they grudgingly give to their nation is a dollar taken from them in robbery.<br />
 <br />
What hypocritical blind turds.  They seek to rule the very same nation they truly couldn't give a shit about.  They use the terms and symbols of patriotism in order to sway the masses, but they are only loyal to themselves and they only care about America for purposes of using America's might to guard their loot for them.  Other than that they couldn't care less about America, much less the people inhabiting it.</blockquote>

<br />
and what I see is that Rmoney is perfectly willing to pay his 10% church tithes because he recognizes just what a splendid boost it's been for him to be a big shot in good standing in a large organization such as the LDS.  <br />
<br />
But for some reason he and the vast majority of the GOP elites are happy to pay 10% and lip service to their churches because they recognize the value those churches have given their stellar careers, but they refuse to pay their NATION its due and necessary taxes and behave as if they have gotten no boost to their careers due to the public sector that they claim to despise.  They revere their churches and they denigrate their nation with the same mouths, and pay tithes without complaint but behave as if every dollar in taxes they grudgingly give to their nation is a dollar taken from them in robbery.<br />
 <br />
What hypocritical blind turds.  They seek to rule the very same nation they truly couldn't give a shit about.  They use the terms and symbols of patriotism in order to sway the masses, but they are only loyal to themselves and they only care about America for purposes of using America's might to guard their loot for them.  Other than that they couldn't care less about America, much less the people inhabiting it.</div>
