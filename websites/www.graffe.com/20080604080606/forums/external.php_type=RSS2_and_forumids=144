			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm just interested in what other Conaniphiles think about how well they captured the essence of the Hyborian setting.<br />
<br />
Personally I think they did a great job on the &quot;mature content&quot; angle. I think the game has just the right amount of language, nudity, blood, etc... to make it feel like a &quot;mature&quot; game without going overboard.<br />
<br />
I think the quests are also pretty good, although they're often too close to standard goody-goody fantasy quests for my taste (especially in Aquilonia, the less Mitra in the game the better I think).<br />
<br />
The world itself is also well done, but I think here they might have mis-stepped a bit. If you read the Howard Conan stories, almost all of them feature Conan in very exotic locales. That's kind of the whole point of them. He's almost always in fantasy analogues of Africa, middle-eastern nations, India and so on. In the game, however, two thirds of the content is in Cimmeria and Aquilonia, places are much more recognizably &quot;european&quot;.<br />
<br />
I think it's no accident that my two favority zones so far have been Tortage and Kopshef province, both of which I think are much more appropriate Conan settings. Hopefully they'll flesh out the rest of world and we'll be able to go to places like Hyrkania, Vendhya, or Zamora, all of which actually featured much more in the stories than Cimmeria.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have thoughts on this?</div>

The system works well.  It's a VERY easymode game.  I mean, it makes WOW look hard.  That having been said, it needs some polish but is definately worth the time.</div>

First things first, if you are really having problems...<br />

Remove your driver in safe mode, run driver sweeper, reboot into safe mode, remove your standard VGA adapter, reboot again and install new driver.<br />
<br />
Next, for whatever reason the &quot;High&quot; graphics setting works better then &quot;Low&quot; just turn off shadows entirely after using it.<br />
<br />
And lastly an old CS trick, running WMP idle in the background will help loading times and give a few FPS.</div>

One thing that I've been intrigued about with Conan is the city-building system.  I'm assuming that's higher level, but what about crafting in general?  Can you make armor/weapons/etc.?  Has anyone gotten into that yet?  I haven't really seen anyone talking about it, either here, or in-game.</div>

<b>Update Notes - 27th of May<br />
</b>General<br />
<br />
* Grouped players that are apprenticed will now get their kill XP capped to the correct level.<br />
* Characters should now always get zoned back from a PvP game<br />
* Characters should now be able to move away from their spot, without the server thinking that they are hacking<br />
* Using a lower rank ability should not lock up your character anymore<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Quests<br />
</b><br />
* Players should no longer lose destiny quests if their quest log is full<br />
* Corrected some typos in various quest texts<br />
* Updated directions in the quest &quot;A Dangerous Challenge&quot;<br />
* The flame on the Torch of Eiglophian will now die after a while in Fields of the Dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Playfields<br />
</b><br />
* Fix a lot of graphics lag issues caused by particles in Tarantia Noble, Field of the Dead and Eiglophian Mountains which should result in much lesser lag in those playfields<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Player Characters<br />
</b><br />
Necromancer<br />
* Necromancer - you no longer lose the Cannibalism spell when investing the second feat<br />
<br />
Guardian<br />
* Guardian - Fixed a problem where the third rank in Counterstrike Stance was not giving you the damage shield while in defensive stance.<br />
<br />
Bear Shaman<br />
* Bear Shaman should now correctly recieve Blood Flow (Rank 3), Claws of Stone (Rank 2), and Spirit of the Bear (Rank 2) at level 40. (Note: If you are past level 40, you will gain these spells at level 45, 50, or 55 instead.)<br />
<br />
Dark Templar<br />
*Feat - the Dread Shadow pet will successfully spawn again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>NPCs<br />
</b><br />
* Ragall the food and drink merchant has received a fresh stock of merchandise.<br />
* Ranger archetype NPCs will no longer cause issues with the player's HP displayed incorrectly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Crafting<br />
</b><br />
* Bow/Crossbow now require wood<br />
* More than 50 alchemy items have been added to vendors<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>City Building<br />
</b><br />
* Requirement checks and consumption of resources when building PVE city buildings should be fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>GUI<br />
</b><br />
* Changed the chat colors to be more like what players are used from other games.<br />
* The guild chat text is now green<br />
* Removed the DirectX 10 option from the option panel.<br />
* Removed the 'Remove from Spellbook' functionality<br />
* OOC chat channel should no longer be inactive after teleports.<br />
<br />
<b>A note about traders and banks<br />
</b>We are fixing the traders and the banks but some exploits would still be possible with the version we have now. We know how important it is to have traders and banks back in the game but the system must work absolutely correct before we put them live again. The possible exploits that would result when this is not ensured would lead to much bigger issues for all players.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your understanding.</div>

But during summer afternoon (or even some week end) I can't raid (not enough people online !).<br />
Then I tried a bruiser in EQ2 100% solo, well, not too bad, but a bit &quot;déjà vu&quot; taste. And even if easy solo, they don't cast ;)<br />
<br />
I also tested for a good while the Vanguard sorcerer, and I love it, I left game, because nothing to do after the highest level if you don't want to raid.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about buying AOC for solo purpose, (with a wizard like char. of course).<br />
Those like Illusive who already played all those games, what are your ideas about aoc ? (I don't want to raid, I want to get pleasure when i'm alone, I don't want to be obliged to find groups, even if I don't want to solo 100%</div>

<b>Update Notes - 26th of May</b><br />
Barbarian in Reaver Stance now correctly moves at slower speed while hiding<br />
<br />
Fixed an exploit with Demonologists (infinite stacking of certain spells)<br />
<br />
Hostile spells casted by the player on itself should no longer trigger reactive spell procs.<br />
<br />
The main reason for this update was to fix an exploit concerning demonologists.<br />
<br />
Updating is sometimes a tricky thing as we have to make sure not to introduce new issues when solving another one. We know there are still other things to fix and the plan is to patch again very soon.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
They need to fix traders and banks ASAP. As much as I liked the launch, there is really no excuse for launching a game with no working auction house or banks.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they'll patch soon, I need to get my hands on decent green/blue 2-hand blunt weapon.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Ok, I went ahead and bought Conan, not knowing if it would run on my machine.  It does just fine, so I'm having a blast :)<br />
<br />
A few questions though... I have read next to nothing about this game, since I figured the graphics would not let me run it.  Now that I can play, I have things I don't know about.<br />
<br />
1 - Combat:  during combat, these little white arrows show up above and to the left/right of my target.  It seems as though the more arrows are on one side, the less chance I have of hitting from that side.  Is that right?  Also, I see yellowish green arrows from time to time as well - are those showing where I am vulnerable?  or what?<br />
<br />
2 - Single play mode?:  I'm level 8, doing a line of quests in Tortage.  Am I in single player mode?  At the start of one quest line, I slept until nightfall, then when I came back, all multiplayer chat has stopped.  I see some quests that give me an option to go back to daytime.  Is this something you can switch back and forth at will?  Or only in certain areas?<br />
<br />
I love this game so far.  The music, the combat, the spell effects, etc.  They all blend together to make a great experience.  Haven't seen any nekkid b00bs yet though... :(<br />
<br />
*edit* oh, for those wondering, I have an Intel dual core 2x2.33 mhz, with 2G ram with an NVidia 8600GT card with 256 MB ram.  I'm running on medium settings and doing just fine.  Haven't tried high level yet, but I might just to see if I can handle it :)</div>
