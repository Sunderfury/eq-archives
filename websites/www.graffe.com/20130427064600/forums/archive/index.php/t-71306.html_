Let me tell you - I'm thinking that doing this really is as expected as pulling an all-nighter or going for extra help. <br />
<br />
It's just something you do. As someone who feels like they are struggling, and even when I feel like I'm not, it seems like everyone else isn't - they may or may not be taking these drugs, but at the end of the day they outrank me. They are succeeding and I'm not.<br />
<br />
This is every bit as competitive - I really should follow suit and do what it takes. I'm tempted to just give in and start buying the pills. <br />
<br />
I'm really disgusted with myself for admitting it, but I'm really jealous of the kids who are taking the drugs and succeeding. I just want to succeed like they do...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Only true if the side effect is failure. Everyone agrees that one has to do what it takes, and my problem is admitting that this is what it takes now. If that what it takes to be successful in this game, then anyone who isn't doing it is going to get left behind. <br />

Pretty much how the argument goes.</div></div><hr />

Just tell yourself they will be struggling when it comes to the real world and you have developed the skill to push yourself to concentrate and work hard on your own rather than resorting to drugs to be successful. <br />
<br />
Harsh reality is they will have a leg up due to better GPA or whatever and wind up just as or more successful than you are because they will do whatever they think it takes to get ahead. It seems like you are letting it get to you though, are all your classes graded on a bell curve or something? Why does the success of other students make you less successful?  Worry about yourself more and other people less.</div></div><hr />

There *are* some things that are actually chemistry. <br />
<br />
My depression is one of them. I've managed to conquer most of it via a combination of experimentation with a few herbal remedies/vitamins that have very low side effects (I settled on maca root (and occasionally a *little* extra pyridoxine (B6) when it's really bad) as the most effective for my biology) and exercise as the solutions. Without them there would still be days where I'd have to struggle *HARD* to just get out of bed even though life may be going great due solely to a genetic brain chemical imbalance.</div></div><hr />

Yes, sometimes it is, I know a guy who's on aderrol and he takes it because he has brain damage from a car accident when he was younger. For a large majority of people, the drugs are useful for clearing your head when you're f'd up, but while your head is clear you should use that time to figure out what's really wrong and work through it.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
No story at all.  When I decided to go back to college I picked computer forensics from the computer science section. 1 it interested me 2 figure if I couldn't get a job with law enforcement doing computer crimes I could open my own computer repair store and give lessons on how to do things on the computer. Could do it much cheaper then Geek Squad(they charge $200 to reformat a harddrive).  Then during the year and talking with my sister about the restaurant idea I added the foodservice part to help with opening a sports bar.<br />
<br />
Since I was a kid I always figured I would own a business of some sorts and sports bar was the first I really started contemplating when I worked in the restaurant field during and after high school.  The computer one came about years later as I became more interested in computers.</div></div><hr />

That isn't what they are really doing.  They are depressing/altering the natural thought processes that you have built and are used to, and usually in very harmful ways, long term.<br />
<br />
I'm a ABD (All But Dissertation) Doctoral Candidate, which, as my advisor said, means I have developed a VERY healthy adaptation to ADD.  I'm a &quot;success story&quot; for ADD/ADHD, and I've talked with dozens of families/kids over the years, the important thing is to learn, and adapt your habits to encourage constructive application of the ADD/ADHD, not treat it into oblivion with drugs.  Firstly, they drugs loose their effectiveness with time, and secondly, they loose their effectiveness with age.  Learning, at an early age, the adaptive behaviors that work for you is the best option, bar none.  But the most important reason to adapt instead of drug is simple.  ADD/ADHD is actually a tremendous advantage in and of itself, you just have to sharpen the upsides, while minimizing the downsides.<br />
<br />
This requires a VERY high level of metacognition.  Paying attention to what helps you actually understand, not &quot;learn well enough for a test&quot;, but truly understand.  It is different for each person, but some helpful tricks that 'usually' work are:<br />
1) High doses (relatively) of Caffine.  Caffine mimicks the mind-altering effects of Adderall/Ritalin, but does so at a much lower level, and is controllable by how much you drink of it.<br />
<br />
2) A low-level external stimulation (I use music or movies that I've heard/seen over 20 times personally), that way I've got it memorized, I don't need to pay attention at all, but it acts as a distractor for the part of my brain that tries, and needs to be distracted.<br />
<br />
3) Frequent, short, study sessions instead of long slog study sessions.  The long hauls DO NOT WORK.  Study for 30-45 minutes, and take a 15 minute break.  This is a very, very key one.  And it's the hardest for people to adapt to, because it requires starting early on projects/papers/homeworks.  Putting things off to the last minute absolutely, positively destroys your ability to understand the material, and makes it even harder to succeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**I was 'diagnosed' formally as a part of university, they wanted me to take a test to prove I was ADD, which amused me, as if a test could really document that. . .  The doctor who is in charge of 'grading' the test commented that he had never, ever, seen a 'higher score' then on my test.  Too which I replied &quot;no shit, Sherlock&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, your description there of ways you deal with ADD/ADHD perfectly match the habits I have formed over the years for exactly the same reason. I have never been &quot;diagnosed&quot; by a doctor with any mental disorders, but I've suspected for many years now that this was the case.<br />
<br />
I have also discovered that meditation is incredibly difficult, and even more beneficial. I only dose caffeen in the morning hours because if I drink any after 3PM or so I won't be able to sleep without difficulty. I almost always have music or movies running in the background, I casually joke about some movies that have made it to my &quot;hundred club&quot; - movies that I've &quot;watched&quot; over 100+ times. I spend entire days switching among different tasks every hour, trying to keep focused on one thing for more than 45 minutes is nearly impossible for me (with the exception of reading books, I can usually handle that for 2-3 hour sessions, or more if the book is really good). When I went back to school, I found that my math homework typically took me two hours a night, but I'd have to get up and take a walk for 10-15 minutes once an hour to keep at it.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, I just listened to what my body and mind were telling me and did what needed to be done. I'm not convinced there's anything more to it. I sleep when I'm tired, I change tasks when I'm bored, I take a break when I can't focus.</div></div><hr />

My point is that they are effective for students in a way that is similar to caffeine being effective for students - increased alertness and concentration which help tons when learning anything.<br />
If you stop drinking coffee when your exams are over, you don't forget the stuff you've learned or become less intelligent. You simply go back to a slower gear of information assimilation. Same with these concentration-enhancing drugs.</div></div><hr />

Pffft. you can cut it in half AT LEAST with no losses. Just charge by the hour and run, first, a data destruction disk, then a FULL format instead of a quick one. It's not like you have to actively flip the bits yourself. You *can* be doing other money-making things while the drive is formatting, assuming you have a customer base. (and lower prices is a great way to get one)<br />
<br />
I'd be willing to wager that Geek Squad just slaves the drive to an existing machine and runs a &quot;format volume /q&quot; (which does nothing more than deleting the file table and the root directory) then passes go and collects their $200 (after making the customer wait 24 hours or whatever to prove that it's &quot;difficult work&quot;). I'm willing to bet they have a separate &quot;Disk Integrity Service&quot; or somesuch that actually scans the disk for bad sectors too.</div></div><hr />

I can tell you I run my own business doing this exact thing.  (I also have a friend who does as well)  I charge $70/hr for in-shop labor and it would be a minimum of 2hrs for this type of job.  If I charged less I could seriously make more money working at McD's.</div></div><hr />

I agree but for most people $50-$75 would be a lot cheaper.  To me marginally cheaper would be within $10-$15 of a competitor in something like this.</div></div><hr />

Not surprising really when you consider most of us are going to be in our mid 30s and older. Still, it's hard not to contrast these stats with the response to my Nootropics thread (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?71184-Anyone-here-got-experience-with-Nootropics)<br />
<br />
And, yeah, it's quite true that you can achieve the same or a better effect with just good technique, good diet and plenty of aerobic exercise, but it's not exactly common in the West to achieve that for all sorts of reasons. <br />
<br />
It's a bit like saying you can achieve Olympic Gold just through good technique, good diet and good training. Of course you can, people do it all the time - but it's a hell of a lot easier by doping! Even if you say doping in sports is banned because of the nasty long term health effects, that still doesn't explain why stuff like blood doping is disallowed (getting a transfusion of red-blood-cell rich blood prior to an event). It's banned because if it were allowed, everyone would have to do it to keep up, and it's better for the image of the sports to have noone do it than everyone do it.<br />
<br />
Likewise, whether this stat of 1 in 4 popping pills and powders is true or not (I tend to suspect not), peer pressure is only going to increase on this. If everyone believes everyone else is doing it, regardless of the truth of the matter, it could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Eventually schools are going to have to take a decision on whether to drug test prior to exams, and I think they'll probably conclude they can't. Too many legitimate reasons for taking them, and too easy to get a doctor to write you a prescription when you don't really need it.<br />
<br />
Still, I was slightly surprised at how negative a reaction people here had to the concept in general. To be fair, the reaction was mostly against Ritalin/Adderal, which, yeah, are unnecessarily strong for any normal healthy person to take. But stuff like Piracetam reportedly has similar effects on concentration and attention span without a lot of the negative side-effects. That's why it's not even a prescription drug in most countries. Think of it like the boost caffeine gives without the negative effects caffeine has (although they don't work like caffeine). Likewise people using Modafinil and their derivatives, which eliminate drowsiness.<br />
<br />
In general, these drugs don't affect intelligence, what they do is allow someone to focus better while they are working, and allow them to work longer without getting drained. You should still follow 'take 15 mins break an hour', 'have a sleep in the middle of the day' type rules - they are good rules whatever else you are doing - but you can work more of the whole day without getting distracted, bored or tired.<br />
<br />
So they say, anyway. Hence me looking for others' experiences!</div></div><hr />

Statistics can say anything you want to.<br />

As to the drug testing - I used to get really good mileage out of Gingko Biloba, which actually increases blood flow to the brain and acts as a Neuroepinephrine Uptake Inhibitor (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WP9-4VWHW29-1/2/183d414dda3d1f2f8a3eede48ca390e2).<br />

<br />
300+ IQs have consequences. Consequences most people can't handle. Hell, I'm barely peaking over 180 on a really good day and I have serious mental twitches that I've had to work to master for a couple decades. Making some random idiot suddenly smart does not give them the developmental ability to suddenly use that intellect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nadiar</div><div class="date">May 24th, 2011, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe, just maybe, the people who need this shit to get by in college really OUGHT TO BE working a cash register or some shit like that.  This is like defrauding their college, themselves, and any future employer who might actually think a degree from an accredited school has some meaning.   Eventually the drugs will wear off and they will go back to being dumbasses.<br />
 <br />
A lot of it isn't really about finishing college or not finishing college, it's that colleges profit from keeping you as long as possible.  I went to a school that took pride in failing out 75% of it's freshman class in the first semester, and 75% of the remainder the next semester.  All of the intro classes were notoriously difficult, and all of the upper classmen I knew either took them at a different school and transferred in, or took them during the summer.  Since I was poor and couldn't afford to NOT work during the summer, I couldn't take the summer classes<br />
<br />
They pulled stunts that I'm pretty sure could have made them lose their accreditation.  My last semester there (3rd semester) they decided withdrawing from a class after registration = 0 GPA.  They told us this after registration.  I had signed up for 24 credit hours, planning to drop classes with shitty instructors.  Instead of just dropping the extra classes, I tried to actually do all of them (5 labs).  I made it about 40% through the semester when I completely burned out.<br />
<br />
<br />
That isn't why I would have ever used nootropics though.  The one thing that made me strongly consider using them was I was working in an extremely stressful job, working 12-13 hour days, and I needed a CCNA to advance out of that position.  Throw on some health issues, and I just didn't have the time or mental power to actually study.  If I could have suddenly cut my required sleep in half, increase my ability to focus, and enhance my memory retention, I would have gotten out of there probably 2 years earlier, which I'm sure would have extended my overall lifespan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nadiar</div><div class="date">May 24th, 2011, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got this from the 4HB Bonus Chapters:<br />
http://www.johannhari.com/2008/05/06/my-experiment-with-smart-drugs<br />
<br />
<br />
It was in March, in the drizzle, that I realized my brain was burned out. Like a rusty engine, I could hear it chug-chug and splutter &#8211; but it would never quite start running at top speed. I had just come back from a rough month-long work-trip to Bangladesh, and I had an Everest of work in front of me. It was all fascinating, and all urgent &#8211; but I was plodding though it at half my normal speed. I needed to be performing at my best; instead I was at my worst. I stared at the London rain from my window, and slogged on.<br />
<br />
That&#8217;s when I stumbled across a small story in an American scientific magazine. It said there was a spiky debate across America&#8217;s universities about the increasing use by students of a drug called Provigil. It was, they said, Viagra for the brain. It was originally designed for narcoleptics in the seventies, but clinical trials had stumbled across something odd: if you give it to non-narcoleptics, they just become smarter. Their memory and concentration improves considerably, and so does their IQ.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s not an amphetamine or stimulant, the article explained: it doesn&#8217;t make you high, or wired. It seems to work by restricting the parts of your brain that make you sluggish or sleepy. No significant negative effects have been discovered. Now students are using it in the run-up to exams as a &#8220;smart drug&#8221; &#8211; a steroid for the mind.<br />
<br />
It sounded perfect. A few clicks on-line and I found I could order it from a foreign pharmacy, just £30 for a month&#8217;s supply. I called a friend who is a GP, and told her what I was thinking of. She&#8217;d heard of people using the drug, and went away and looked up the details. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a stupid thing to do, because you shouldn&#8217;t ever take drugs you don&#8217;t need,&#8221; she said when she called back. &#8220;Do I think it&#8217;ll seriously harm you? No, I don&#8217;t. But you&#8217;d be much better off taking a long holiday than narcolepsy pills.&#8221; Then she warned me: &#8220;There is one known side-effect.&#8221; Oh, damn I thought. A downside. &#8220;It often causes people to lose weight.&#8221; Are you mad? You become cleverer and thinner? I whipped out my Visa card immediately.<br />
<br />
A week later, the little white pills arrived in the post. I sat down and took one 200mg tablet with a glass of water. It didn&#8217;t seem odd: for years, I took an anti-depressant. Then I pottered about the flat for an hour, listening to music and tidying up, before sitting down on the settee. I picked up a book about quantum physics and super-string theory I have been meaning to read for ages, for a column I&#8217;m thinking of writing. It had been hanging over me, daring me to read it. Five hours later, I realised I had hit the last page. I looked up. It was getting dark outside. I was hungry. I hadn&#8217;t noticed anything, except the words I was reading, and they came in cool, clear passages; I didn&#8217;t stop or stumble once.<br />
<br />
Perplexed, I got up, made a sandwich &#8211; and I was overcome with the urge to write an article that had been kicking around my subconscious for months. It rushed out of me in a few hours, and it was better than usual. My mood wasn&#8217;t any different; I wasn&#8217;t high. My heart wasn&#8217;t beating any faster. I was just able to glide into a state of concentration &#8211; deep, cool, effortless concentration. It was like I had opened a window in my brain and all the stuffy air had seeped out, to be replaced by a calm breeze.<br />
<br />
Once that article was finished, I wanted to do more. I wrote another article, all of it springing out of my mind effortlessly. Then I go to dinner with a few friends, and I decide not to tell them, to see if they notice anything. At the end of the dinner, my mate Jess turns to me and says, &#8220;You seem very thoughtful tonight.&#8221;<br />
<br />
That night, I lay in bed, and I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I wasn&#8217;t restless or tetchy; I just kept thinking very clearly, and I wanted to write it all down. I remembered there&#8217;s a long history of people in high-pressure jobs using stimulants when their brains lost their sponginess: Anthony Eden was taking Benzedrine all through the Suez Crisis, and Jean-Paul Sartre wrote several of his novels while pumped on mescaline. Admittedly, these precedents aren&#8217;t encouraging: Eden had a break-down, and Sartre&#8217;s brain was so cooked that for the rest of his life, he had the recurring fear that he was being followed by a giant lobster. Am I making a stupid mistake? Am I mad?<br />
<br />
The next morning I woke up and felt immediately alert. Normally it takes a coffee and an hour to kick-start my brain; today I&#8217;m ready to go from the second I rise. And so it continues like this, for five days: I inhale books and exhale articles effortlessly. My friends all say I seem more contemplative, less rushed &#8211; which is odd, because I&#8217;m doing more than normal. One sixty-something journalist friend says she remembers taking Benzadrine in the sixties to get through marathon articles, but she&#8217;d collapse after four or five says and need a long, long sleep. I don&#8217;t feel like that. I keep waiting for an exhausted crash, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to come.<br />
<br />
When the American journalist David Plotz took Provigil, he said it should be given a slogan. Just as valium was marketed as &#8220;the housewife&#8217;s little helper,&#8221; he said this should be sold as &#8220;the boss&#8217; little helper.&#8221; It makes you work better and harder than before.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s hard to explain Provigil&#8217;s effects beyond that. Normally, one day out of seven I have a day when I&#8217;m working at my best &#8211; I&#8217;ve slept really well, and everything comes easily and fast. Provigil makes every day into that kind of day. It&#8217;s like I have been upgraded to a new operating system: Johann 3.0. On discussion boards, I talk to American student doctors taking the drug, who say they feel exactly the same way. &#8220;I keep thinking &#8211; where&#8217;s the catch?&#8221; one says. It turns out it is being given to US soldiers too.<br />
<br />
It was then that I noticed: I just wasn&#8217;t very hungry. I am normally porcine; my ex once seriously considered having a trough made for me. But on Provigil, I was filled up by a bowl of soup and a piece of bread. I would feel stuffed half-way through my normal meals, and push the food away unfinished. One of my friends howled: &#8220;Who are you, and what have you done with the real Johann?&#8221;<br />
<br />
Is all this just the placebo effect: I expect it to do this to me, so it does? Perhaps. But in the clinical trials, it worked much better than the placebo. But then I began to worry again. We don&#8217;t know the long-term effects of this drug: nobody has been taking it for long. What if it causes your brain to deplete its resources and wear out? My wonderful grandmother has dementia, her life and personality dissolving in lost memories; no short-term concentration is worth that. A friend says to me one afternoon, &#8220;Why do you always feel like you&#8217;re not good enough, and you need some kind of chemical enhancement?&#8221; It makes me wonder. There are also concerns that if you take it for too long, it can become addictive. So after five days on, I decided to take three days off, to see what would happen.<br />
<br />
It was easy. I painlessly sagged back to my former somewhat-depleted state, as though the Provigil had never happened. I worked in my usual stop-start bursts. I ate my usual portions-and-a-half. I stared sadly at the pack of Provigil, and every time I hit a mental stumbling block, I had to discipline myself not to crack out a Provigil.<br />
<br />
As soon as my three days were up and I started again, my brain revved back into super-speed and my stomach began to shrivel. But this time I began to worry about the ethics of it all. If this drug had been available during my A-Levels or finals, I would have been the first to guzzle it down. But isn&#8217;t that cheating? What&#8217;s the difference between Provigil for students and steroids for athletes? And if this drug becomes as popular as, say, anti-depressants or Ritalin, won&#8217;t there be a social pressure for workers to take it? Many parents feel intensely pressured by schools today to drug away their child&#8217;s disobedience; will they feel pressured by their bosses to drug away their natural fatigue?<br />
<br />
Professor Anjan Chatterjee says, &#8220;This age of cosmetic neurology is coming, and we need to know it&#8217;s coming.&#8221; The use of Provigil and its progeny will be mainstream and mainlined in just a few years, he argues, and this made me feel excited by the prospect &#8211; and anxious. But all this raced through my brain as I worked faster (and ate less) than I ever have: it was hard to dwell on the drawbacks in those circumstances. As the end of my final five days approached, I had to decide what to do. Do I order another pack? Do I try to think all my thoughts at a faster pace from here on in with the power of Provigil?<br />
<br />
I paced and agonised and finally concluded that taking narcolepsy drugs when you don&#8217;t have narcolepsy is just stupid. Our lack of knowledge about what it does to your brain was, in the end, a deal-breaker for me. Perhaps in sixty years we&#8217;ll know for sure it&#8217;s safe, and I will have spent my life at only sixty percent brain-capacity &#8211; but I&#8217;d rather risk that than brain damage. So I have cut a deal with myself. I am keeping a pack in the bathroom cabinet for the days when I am really knackered and have to be able to work fast and fluently &#8211; but I won&#8217;t ever take more than two or three a month.<br />
<br />
As I put the tablets aside, I look out over my flat. My desk is piled high with the vast quantities of work I have pumped out. My cupboards are full of uneaten food. The whole place is freakishly clean, something I did in my spare time, without even thinking about it. Ah, Provigil, you are a gorgeous temptress. With a sad sigh, I close the bathroom cabinet on her sweet temptation, and stumble back to my slow, patchy life, with my slow, patchy brain.<br />
<br />
POSTSCRIPT: For legal reasons, I have been advised not to tell people which online pharmacy I bought the Provigil from. (Basically, if it poisoned you, I'd be liable.) So please don't email me and ask for the link - I can't tell you. Sorry.<br />

Second, intelligence is closely linked with curiosity.  Curiosity is great, it encourages intelligent people to continually learn more, and to explore their surroundings more.  It also causes intelligent people to abuse drugs more often.  They're less likely to accept someone telling them &quot;drugs are bad&quot; unless they have evidence that it is actually bad.</div></div><hr />

Consequences most people can't handle. Hell, I'm barely peaking over 180 on a really good day and I have serious mental twitches that I've had to work to master for a couple decades. Making some random idiot suddenly smart does not give them the developmental ability to suddenly use that intellect.<br />
 <br />
I hear that, man.  Giving a temporarily higher intellect to someone is a bit like temporarily giving a child an adult body, it might turn out to be a great teaching experience or it could go horribly wrong.  Or perhaps a bit like giving a student driver the keys to a Lamborghini.  People run their own minds off of cliffs all of the time, it's a lot easier when you're driving a borrowed intellect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elasto</div><div class="date">May 24th, 2011, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A chip that enhances IQ is going to be way way down the road. I mean, by the time we could have one of those, we've basically cracked hard AI.<br />
<br />
Long before that we'll have chips that augment memory, though, and that isn't so likely to cause mental instability (although it could if done badly, of course - if you couldn't stop remembering things, say). <br />
<br />
Savants have a great memory and poor social skills because their brain is actually physically misformed; There are whole functional blocks effectively missing. A chip that allows you to multiple 12345x54321 in your head isn't going to cause you to suddenly be unable to empathise with other people, though, because that function of the brain will still be there.<br />
<br />
And Nadiar's story I've read a lot, in different forms. The way I heard it described that made best sense to me was that these drugs simply make your brain work as if you were in tip-top physical shape - good diet, regular exercise, plenty of sleep etc; Which is why for many people they don't appear to have much effect. They don't change intelligence or personality or anything, they simply make concentrating on a task effortless. As his article says: &quot;It&#8217;s hard to explain Provigil&#8217;s effects beyond that. Normally, one day out of seven I have a day when I&#8217;m working at my best &#8211; I&#8217;ve slept really well, and everything comes easily and fast. Provigil makes every day into that kind of day.&quot;<br />
<br />
The only nootropic I've taken to date has been Alertec (Provigil), but I never took it like this guy did; I took it when I had no time to sleep one night. And, yeah, it basically made me feel exactly how I feel after I've had a full night's sleep. Not 'pepped' or 'hyper' like caffeine would, just completely normal - despite having not slept. And nor did it stop me being able to sleep later, either. It's was like the bit of the brain that makes you feel like you want to sleep simply didn't exist (but I still could when I chose to).<br />
<br />
Sure, we don't know the long term effects of some of these drugs, so it's always 'use at your own risk' (although substances like Piracetam have been around for decades with still no downsides known of), but there's no doubt in my mind personally that not too far down the road it's going to be normal to take such substances to improve quality of life.</div></div><hr />
