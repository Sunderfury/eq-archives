			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Just a heads up that his is going on now. November 26 - December 2. If you miss anything, don't worry about it, as this is arguably just a warm up to the Winter sale they will have a month from now. Last year the prices between the two sales didn't change much, so you can also use it to plan ahead of time what you are going to get and how much you want to spend. As it is simply an &quot;in-between&quot; sale, there is no gimmick this time. Just a selection of dailies that change every 24 hours, but you still have access to the previous day, so you have 48 hours to decide if you want to buy something or not.<br />
<br />
If you do decide to pick something up though, just remember the motto &quot;wait for the daily&quot;. Many things will be discounted, then get bigger discounts when they are featured on any particular day. If on the last day the thing you want hasn't been featured, go ahead and pick it up. Or wait for the sale next month. I've also found that if something isn't already discounted, it probably won't go on sale at all, but last year a few titles subverted this trend, so keep your eyes open.<br />
<br />
I've got Dragon Age right now, so am not sure if I'm interested in anything myself.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as this is Black Friday week, a lot of online retailers are also having sales. I haven't been following these too closely, but I do know EA is having an Origin sale. Titanfall for $5 is the best deal I saw, although it obviously doesn't include the map packs.</div>

<br />
I really, really liked this unit; the sound quality, power, the calibration procedure, and multi-room capability.<br />
<br />
But I have had a ridiculous amount of trouble with it since we purchased it.  At first I suspected I just had a couple of old, intermittently failing HDMI cables.  But after replacing them and seeing the same issues I realized it was the tuner.  Then some of the listening modes started failing, and the remote quit responding in some of the modes so now we leave it in the same, worthless mode for TV, DVD and music.  And lately it's losing its connection with the DVR frequently, if only momentarily, but because I have our video going through it we lose audio and video for 2 seconds all the time while it re-establishes.  It's just been a nightmare.<br />
<br />
I've upgraded the firmware multiple times and spoken to folks in tech support.  Their suspicion is the main board inside which the repair or replacement cost would closely match that of a new unit, so I think that's going to be my Christmas this year.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any good recommendations for similar units?  I'm looking at Sony and Pioneer as I shant purchase another Onkyo piece of equipment again in the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
I like multi-room capability so I can pump music out to my porch in summers, and need an all purpose model for watching movies and sports as well as listening to music.</div>

<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">

	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Canadian developer Brand &amp; Grotesque came up with a fun way to donate blood: by tying it into a video game.<br />
<br />
<b>Entitled Blood Sport, it would &quot;raise the stakes of gaming, by making it so when you lose blood in the game, you lose it in real life, too,&quot; its creators boasted.</b><br />
<br />
Only there's one problem: Kickstarter shuttered the Blood Sport crowdfunding campaign only six days after it launched.<br />
<br />
The reasons may seem obvious, as Blood Sport sounds like it could be dangerous, but Brand &amp; Grotesque weren't planning to sell the gaming unit to the public. Instead, it was conceived for charity drives.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our goal is to develop a refined multiplayer unit that can be taken across the country for blood donation gaming events,&quot; the developer explained. &quot;We are not a charity and we are not a game manufacturer. We are simply creating the gaming hardware that will allow us to get gamers thinking about more important issues while still doing what they love. From there, we'll partner with the appropriate organisations in both the gaming and medical communities to bring it all to life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brand &amp; Grotesque explained that the device's hardware was quite simple and just a riff off the usual rumble technology where certain inputs (i.e. taking damage) would result in the controller sending a signal to drain a bit more blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not inventing any new medical devices and it's not for sale. All we want to do is create the best, most immersive gaming experience possible - while also helping people in need,&quot; the developer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously, Blood Sport has a lot of skeptics. More than anything, people fear giving blood. And when you add a competitive layer to it, even more so. But by running carefully monitored tests with medical professionals, we've created a unit that makes blood donation easy, fun and nearly painless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, some might worry that Blood Sport could be used irresponsibly, but Brand &amp; Grotesque were planning a blood donation drive, where the machine would only be used in the hands of a medical professional. &quot;The machine is always monitored by a certified professional, and never runs without one,&quot; it noted in the FAQ.<br />
<br />
So why was blood Sport suspended on Kickstarter? It's not quite clear yet. Kickstarter told CNET that it doesn't comment on specific project suspensions, while we've requested comment from Brand &amp; Grotesque to see if it can shed any more light on this issue.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was the highest reward tier of $5000 CAD that would share the code for how to build your own Blood Sport machine? That seems like knowledge best not shared with a random wealthy person who plops down a few grand in Canadian currency, as in the wrong hands it could turn into something of a Hostel situation.<br />
<br />
Blood Sport likely would have failed to reach its $250K CAD target anyway, as it had only acquired $3390 CAD in six days, but the more interesting question is whether Kickstarter should have shut it down. What do you think of this unnerving technology being carted around for a good cause?     <br />

I can see this being 2, maybe 3 at the most.  Movie 1: virus, everyone dies, people start dreaming about Nebraska.  Movie 2: characters make their way to Nebraska and Las Vegas, maybe even set up in Boulder by the end.  Movie 3: Big showdown.  Even that is stretching it I think.  But 4?  Come on!<br />

</div>Greatest show I ever saw was Must-see Pedro in 99.  Last year, people were crowing about Maddux and Glavine but those two were MEDIOCRE pitchers throwing to lesser lineups.  Koufax is the only comparable in the history of the game and Pedro was better.<br />
<br />
Pedro 17 Ks against the 99 Yankees - I remember this like it was yesterday.  God I love him.  <br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>FYI, if you have a nexus 7 (from 2012), lollipop absolutely destroys performance (in a bad way). Like, unusable way. I would highly recommend holding off on the update for the time being.<br />
<br />
I was able to get it usable again by disabling google now and going into developer settings and turning off animations, and limiting background processes to 2 or 3.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how this update got pushed for this nexus with the kind of issues that came up. I don't even know what's causing the issue. The cpu isn't doing anything significant (except for the occasional load average spiking to 27), and ram isn't maxed out, so I'm not sure where the bottleneck is.</div>
