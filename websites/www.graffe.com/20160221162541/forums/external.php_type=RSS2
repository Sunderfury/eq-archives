<br />
World of Warcraft: Chronicle Volume 1 is a journey through an age of myth and legend, a time long before the Horde and the Alliance came to be. This definitive tome of Warcraft history reveals untold stories about the birth of the cosmos, the rise of ancient empires, and the forces that shaped the world of Azeroth and its people.<br />
<br />
This beautiful hardcover features twenty-five full-page paintings by World of Warcraft artist Peter Lee, as well as a cosmology chart, half a dozen maps charting changes through time, and other line art illustrations by Joseph Lacroix, and marks the first in a multipart series exploring the Warcraft universe; from the distant past to the modern era.

Following in the grand tradition of pre-Olympic fuck-ups, the International Olympic Committee and 2016 Summer Olympics host city Rio de Janeiro have teamed up to bring us the summer games’ first big problem: shit water.<br />
<br />
Rio’s waterways are notoriously sewage-laden, something that is obviously a concern for the athletes who will be competing in water sports in 2016. The IOC would have you believe that the water is just fine, though, because they’ve been testing the bacterial levels and have found everything to be relatively clean. They have not, however, been testing for viral pathogens, which according to an Associated Press investigation, is the real problem:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			The AP viral testing, which will continue in the coming year, found not one water venue safe for swimming or boating, according to global water experts.<br />
<br />
Instead, the test results found high counts of active and infectious human adenoviruses, which multiply in the intestinal and respiratory tracts of people. These are viruses that are known to cause respiratory and digestive illnesses, including explosive diarrhea and vomiting, but can also lead to more serious heart, brain and other diseases.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>And yet, the IOC doesn’t feel that it is obligated to test the waters for viruses, simply because the World Health Organization’s official recommendation in such cases is to test for bacteria. The WHO did release a statement following the publication of the AP’s investigation in which testing for viruses was recommended, but later clarified that said recommendation was not an “official” stance. The IOC is simply parsing technicalities—who gives a shit what the “official” recommendation from WHO is?—in order to keep ignoring the fact that athletes will be swimming in shit. Here’s what Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi had to say about it:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			“WHO is very clear that bacterial testing is what should be followed,” said Dubi. “They have restated that bacterial testing is the measure that has to be used and will continue to be used by the authorities. ... It is the best measure to be used.”<br />
<br />
“We have also asked if with these measures and with this testing we can ensure the quality of the water for the athletes and preserving safety and the answer is yes,” he said.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Earlier this week, 13 American rowers who were competing in the World Rowing Junior Championships in Rio came down with severe stomach illnesses. <br />

When bidding to host the 2016 Summer Olympics, Rio de Jaineiro promised the International Olympics Committee that it would eliminate 80 percent of the sewage found in the city’s notoriously filthy water, and would fully regenerate the lagoon in which rowing and kayaking events will be held. Now a few months from the start of the games, Rio has given up on keeping those promises.<br />
<br />
Outside The Lines’ Bonnie Ford has a thorough examination of the current state of Rio’s water pollution, and things aren’t looking so great. Ford visits several areas in which the water is laden with trash, and describes being overwhelmed by the smell of raw sewage on a few occasions. She also got this quote from the Rio 2016 spokeswoman:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			“It’s not going to happen because there was not enough commitment, funds and energy,” Rio 2016 spokesman Mario Andrada told Outside the Lines. “However, we finally got something that the bay has been missing for generations, which is public will for the cleaning.<br />
<br />
“Nobody wants to have guests at their house and show a dirty house. So if we’re not able to reach the target, we need to keep working until the last minute and make sure that the athletes can compete in safe waters, and we’ve been doing this.”
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>That’s not a very encouraging statement, doubly so considering that independent testing done by the Associated Press suggested that the presence of viral pathogens in the water was a problem the IOC was failing to address.<br />
<br />
The athletes have also resigned themselves to the fact that they will be competing in water that could very well make them sick. OTL’s story cites a 2015 U.S. Olympic Committee planning document that says the committee does “not expect to anticipate major reductions in bacterial or viral pathogen levels at the competition venues.” This has left many of the athletes to take extra precautions while competing:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			The U.S. will send 48 rowers to Rio, and they will be as forewarned and forearmed as the federation can make them, starting with squeeze bottles of hand sanitizer that will be distributed on the flight to Brazil.<br />
<br />
Hannafin says the athletes have been asked to get hepatitis A vaccinations and polio boosters and take the oral typhoid vaccine. Their oar handles will be bleached and their boats washed inside and out after each training session or competition. Gear will be laundered at a high enough temperature to kill microbes. “Track bites”—the nicks rowers get on the backs of their calves from their sliding seats—will be cleaned and covered to reduce the chance of infection. Probiotics screened by the USOC will be on the training table.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Should be a great Olympics.<br />
<br />

<br />
They are probably still available somewhere, but stopped selling them around here as far as I can tell, I had not realizind ALL the crunchwraps were going to be a limited time thing.<br />
<br />
They were the perfect food item for me when I am in a fastfood context. They were easy to eat while driving, stayed together even when you get to the last bits, did not taste horrible, were very filling at 460 kcal each, did not take forever to eat, and they did not take up a lot of volume in my stomach, and as an added bonus they were super cheap at 1 dollar each. <br />
<br />
For 5 dollars I could get around my daily kcal and they did not need to be eaten straightaway. They could be reheated fairly well and at room temperature they were still alright.<br />
<br />
And then TB takes it all away from me.</div>

			Fantastic news! Obama has officially cut all abstinence only education from the 2017 federal budget. This will save our country $10 million dollars a year on a program that has proven to be ineffective. The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) issued the following statement in response: <br />
<br />
    SIECUS is grateful for President Obama’s leadership in seeking to end abstinence-only-until-marriage funding once and for all. After three decades and nearly $2 billion in federal spending wasted on this failed approach, the President’s proposed budget increases support for programs and efforts that seek to equip young people with the skills they need to ensure their lifelong sexual health and well-being.<br />
<br />
    “SIECUS also applauds the President’s proposed $4 million increase for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, helping communities implement evidence-informed and innovative strategies to support the sexual health of our nation’s youth.”<br />
<br />
    “The continued funding for the Division of Adolescent and School Health and request for future Personal Responsibility Education Program funding demonstrates this administration’s commitment to secure the right to quality sexuality education for young people.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>W00t!<br />
<br />
I'm also happy about the increase in the teen pregnancy prevention program.<br />
<br />
Even if your religion mandates that you should only have sex with your spouse and only after marriage, it's still HEALTHY for kids to KNOW about sex and KNOW how to avoid STD's and unwanted pregnancy.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As I'm sure many of you have watched John Oliver this week, it has left me with a substantial question that he brought up, but didn't answer.  Near the end of the video he talks about Ghost voting, where the elected official will cast a vote for a separate elected official.  They claim it's standard practice, and often the absentee has asked for it, but this is often not the case.  It's become such habit that they routinely just cast the votes.<br />
<br />
One of the clips even showed a representative being beaten to his own voting button.  In other words he was there, and someone else still cast his vote.  And Oliver insinuates that this can cross party lines and sometimes they may not even be aware of it.  If your back is turned someone my ghost vote your button, and after you turn around and cast your vote, have no idea it doesn't count.<br />
<br />
So the question is, how is this not blatantly illegal?  They are caught on camera all the time doing this.  I have never heard of this before John Oliver, but this is outright insanity to me.<br />
<br />
I get that they cast alot of votes, and maybe they can't be there for all of them, but that's the job.  It is their responsibility to be there or miss the vote.  Allowing this behavior, even if votes are always cast on the absentee's wish, is still voter fraud.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have more information about this?<br />
<br />

			WASHINGTON — A decorated Marine veteran is recovering after a brutal attack Friday night. He says it happened at a McDonald's on 911 E St., N.W., in Washington.<br />
<br />
ABC7 News broke this story and has new details about a possible crucial piece of evidence. Wednesday night, reports suggest that Metropolitan Police may not release surveillance video from the incident.<br />
<br />
30-year-old Chris Marquez was in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and received a bronze star for his heroism.<br />
<br />
Marquez says while he was eating at a McDonald's Friday night, a group of young people surrounded him and began yelling about &quot;black lives matter.&quot; Marquez says he sensed trouble and ignored them. When he left he was attacked and viciously beaten. <br />
<br />
McDonald's says it turned surveillance video over to Metropolitan Police. Wednesday night, Marquez wonders why police have not released it. He fears his attackers will strike again. This is what Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Peter Newsham said Wednesday about the video.<br />
<br />
&quot;If there is evidence associated with the case we will get it out there and share it with the public. You know we have to look at for example with video in cases, the value and the chance that somebody may be able to identify a suspect from that, and once we are able to put that together, and we do have that we will share it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris Marquez told ABC7 News detectives informed him Wednesday that the surveillance video from McDonald's is poor quality and likely will not be released. Since his attackers robbed him and used his credit cards, investigators are focused on those stores and are looking for video there.

			Adobe has patched its Creative Cloud apps after people noticed the software was deleting Mac users' files without warning.<br />
<br />
After customers updated Creative Cloud, it accessed their hard drive and deleted the first folder that appeared in alphabetical order.<br />
<br />
Due to file-naming conventions on Mac computers, the bug often deleted hidden system folders or data backup files.<br />
<br />
Adobe issued a fix for the issue on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Many people in the creative industries have reacted angrily on social media.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Creative Cloud is what screwed up my Backblaze backups. Thanks, Adobe,&quot; said college instructor JJ Litke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Adobe owes us an explanation, and owes Backblaze a public apology. This bug is disturbing and terrifying,&quot; tweeted Funjon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great news that fix is out but very disappointed Adobe haven't been very transparent or apologetic about the issue,&quot; said another user.<br />
<br />
The problem came to light on Thursday after Backblaze, which makes data backup software, started receiving hundreds of support requests from its customers.<br />
<br />
The firm's software detected that some of the files it uses to perform its duties had been deleted, and staff discovered that Creative Cloud was responsible after a designer installed Adobe's update.<br />
<br />
The issue was present in Creative Cloud version 3.5.0.206 on a Mac.<br />
<br />
&quot;We kept testing and realised that this was occurring upon 'sign-in' to Creative Cloud,&quot; Backblaze said on its blog.<br />
<br />
<b>Alphabetical order</b><br />
<br />
The company later identified the Creative Cloud bug was deleting the first folder that appeared on the hard drive in alphabetical order.<br />
<br />
On a Mac, hidden files and folders are prefixed with &quot;.&quot; which the operating system places before A in alphabetical order.<br />
<br />
The flaw interfered with Backblaze's software by chance because the backup software places a hidden folder called &quot;.bzvol&quot; on the hard drives it indexes, which happened to be top of the list.<br />
<br />
On machines without the backup software installed, a different folder may have been deleted instead.<br />
<br />
&quot;As someone affected by this bug I am pretty annoyed. Materially it hasn't (yet) cost me any work, but it's a huge violation of trust,&quot; said one user on Reddit.<br />
<br />
In a statement, Adobe said: &quot;On the 12 Feb we were notified that some customers had an issue with an update to the Creative Cloud Desktop application.<br />
<br />
&quot;We removed the update from distribution and deployed a new one which addresses the issue.&quot;

But in the video where he is sparring with McGregor, The Mountain looks like the proper huge bastard my mind imagined while reading the books<br />
<br />

<iframe class="restrain" title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nbaNRhfizsQ?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"  allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen  mozallowfullscreen ></iframe>
<br />
<br />
I wonder if they scaled him down in the TV show now.<br />
<br />
Conor McGregor is approximately 5'9&quot;, 155 pounds for reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor</a><br />
<br />
So that is a good comparison for what a working human would look like in comparison to the actor. In the real world, I would expect the relative difference between the Game of Thrones era people and The Mountain to be even greater though due to poorer health and resource availability.</div>

			Expanding the universe introduced in the hit franchise that electrified the culture and earned $200 million at the worldwide box office, Universal Pictures’ The Purge: Election Year reveals the next terrifying chapter that occurs over 12 hours of annual lawlessness sanctioned by the New Founders of America to keep this country great.<br />
<br />
It’s been two years since Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) stopped himself from a regrettable act of revenge on Purge Night. Now serving as head of security for Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), his mission is to protect her in a run for president and survive the annual ritual that targets the poor and innocent. But when a betrayal forces them onto the streets of D.C. on the one night when no help is available, they must stay alive until dawn…or both be sacrificed for their sins against the state.<br />
<br />
Once again returning to collaborate with franchise creator James DeMonaco on The Purge: Election Year are the series’ producers: Blumhouse Productions’ Jason Blum (Insidious and Ouija series, The Visit), Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ouija series, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and writer/director DeMonaco’s longtime production partner, Sébastien K. Lemercier (Assault on Precinct 13, Four Lovers).

			2015 was a banner year for cybercriminals. We reported on 53 events that made it into the headlines, however that was just what we reported. There were many more than that occurred.<br />
<br />
We took a look at what was trending to try to predict the next “big things” in cyber security to be on the lookout for in 2016.<br />
<br />
    Ransomware:<br />
    Ransomware is the big topic this year. The first noticeable case of ransomware popped up in 2013, and hackers have latched on to this tactic, refining it over the years. In 2015 we reported on six major ransomware campaigns, which ranged from Mac to Android. Since ransomware can technically be performed on all device platforms, we expect to see a surge in these campaigns. Whatever happens, do NOT pay the ransom, and be sure to keep regular backups to help defend against these attacks.<br />
<br />
    Fake Support Scams:<br />
    We saw increasing reports about tech support scams. Scammers use social engineering tactics in order to try to trick you into downloading malware onto your computer. They can come via a phone call from someone who claims to be from a tech support company stating that they have found a problem on your computer. Internet pop-up ads can also be a source of this scam. They usually display a message stating that the computer is infected and offer a phone number for help with removing the malware. Often, these pop-ups will look like they come from a legitimate source, such as our own Norton products. Just remember, anyone contacting you asking you for money or access to your computer is a red flag.<br />
<br />
    You can also get support right through the product itself in three easy steps! All you have to do is:<br />
    Open your copy of Norton, and click ‘Help’ , which will open up the Help Center. Then click the first option under ‘I need help using this product’ and that will take you straight to our official support page.<br />
<br />
    Always know that Norton will never call you asking for anything. If you ever need to get support from us, we’re right at your fingertips in four ways: contacting us directly by phone or chat, or contact us via Twitter (link is external) or Facebook (link is external).<br />
    Data Breaches:<br />
    Unfortunately, data breaches are becoming almost as common as malware outbreaks. We reported on 16 events, from large institutions to small. And this isn’t just credit card fraud. Big data is big money for attackers, so they set their sights on companies that tend to hold large amounts of personally identifiable data on their customers, such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses and even medical records.  It’s easy for a cybercrime victim to report credit card fraud and just get a new number. When it comes to Social Security numbers, you are bound to it for life. And Social Security numbers open the door to all sorts of identity theft.<br />
    You can click here to learn more about what you need to know about data breaches.<br />
     <br />
<br />
    Your Norton Moves With You:<br />
    Once you’re ready on your new device, all you need to do is visit our product download page, sign into your Norton account and just download your Norton to your new device.<br />
<br />
    Are you thinking of getting a new operating system like Windows 10? Getting a new device isn’t the only instance where your Norton moves with you. Ensure you have the latest version of your Norton product to make sure Norton stays on your PC when upgrading the operating system and you’re good to go!<br />
<br />
    Software Vulnerabilities and Software Updates:<br />
    Major software vulnerabilities hit big in 2015. Attackers heavily rely upon these vulnerabilities, as it is the easiest way to sneak malware into a user’s device unnoticed, with little action on the user’s part. The best way to combat against these attacks is to perform any and all software updates as soon as they are available. Software updates perform a myriad of tasks to the program they are updating, such as patching those security holes attackers exploit, add new features and improve bug fixes. Recently, Microsoft announced their ending of support for Internet Explorer versions 7, 8, 9 and 10. Ending support means the end of software updates, so it is likely that many users may be migrating to the new Windows 10 for access to the new Edge browser.<br />
<br />
    Windows 10 and Migration:<br />
    In addition to these hot topics, another one that was of noticeable interest was the Windows 10 release. In 2015, Microsoft offered up its operating system for free for the first time, either for old devices or installing them on new ones. Migration is not as easy as it sounds, but we have outlined steps in order to make the transition a breeze for you.
