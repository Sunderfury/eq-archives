			“The thing I really have against him is actually how he and Gov. Romney have misused the Declaration of Independence,” said Harris-Perry Saturday. “I’m deeply irritated by their notion that the ‘pursuit of happiness’ means money for the richest and that we extricate the capacity of ordinary people to pursue happiness. When they say ‘God and nature give us our rights, not government,’ that is a lovely thing to say as a wealthy white man.”
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Fascinating that when you read it in context she is not attacking him for being a white male, she is merely pointing out the fact that while god may have granted everyone rights she as a black woman needed the federal government to force the country to respect those rights; Paul Ryan did not.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">It's not surprising that Harris-Perry's comment makes more sense in context.  White male oppression only has any traction as a whine when completely divorced from the actual context that exists.  Maybe the angry old white guys should give thought to the &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; and wonder if they would choose &quot;people say bad stuff about us being rich&quot; over &quot;I'm poor as shit&quot;.  Actually we already know their answer as they certainly could choose to be poor if being old and rich is causing them so much trouble.<br />
<br />
Being liberal isn't an excuse or free card that gets you out of &quot;being old white and rich&quot; it's an acknowledgement that you aren't the sole reason you are that way and that others may not have had the same advantages, and couldn't the world just be a bit better if we did try to afford those advantages to others.</blockquote>

Look, I'm a white middle class male. I get paid better, have had better opportunities, and have had none of the setbacks that the people I know who are around me have had. I got a job with a DoE contractor on the spot - why? because I had the job knowledge - but it was also really fucking easy to get me cleared to be in a National Lab. Why? Because I grew up in a nice neighborhood, so I was never tempted to do any crime, so I didn't have to deal with the decision between ruin my future or starve tonight ever.<br />
<br />
I'm 25 and making above the median salary in the US. Really, I have no place to bitch. I'm not embarrassed I'm a white middle class male, nor am I proud of it, I just AM.<br />
<br />
It's about damn time people stopped trying to play off liberal white male &quot;Don't give a fuck about being a white male&quot; as being &quot;embarrassed&quot;. Racial pride is a shitty reason to have solidarity. What's embarrassing is people who think just because you're a white guy that's something that makes you worthy of my goddamn notice. Go do something useful first.</blockquote>

Your taxes are collected and then you are taken for granted.  The only benefits you get are the benefits everyone gets: roads, police, mail, military.<br />

</div>3 years old - Headstart program - Applies to white male also.  <br />
17 years old - School programs - Applies to white male also (except of course that inner city schools, which have a predominant minority racial group would still suffer.)  My argument of course would be that the white male 17 year old doesn't NEED the assistance but that the programs don't preclude that assistance - and IF majority children attended the same schools as minority children then the benefits would apply equally.<br />
<br />
18 Years old - Pell Grants/Opportunity tax credit -- Applies to white male also.<br />
22 years old - Obama care allowing children to stay on parents insurance through age 26 -- Applies to White male also.<br />
23 Years old - Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- Ok, we've finally got to one that doesn't apply to the White male...  of course, the white male doesn't need it... He already makes more.  so whatever.  <br />
25 Years old - payback terms for Student loans -- Applies to white male also.<br />
27 Years old - Birthcontrol -- Well, males can get birth control for free/extremely cheap anyways.  it's easier, less intrusive, - and nobody tries to make your healthcare decisions for you.  I suppose we could take that away -- so that then this could apply equally if you wanted.  Would that make you happy?<br />
31 Years old -- Ok, Pregnancy - you can't get pregnant so don't need additional healthcare coverage.  Yipppeee we've found another that doesn't apply to your white male.<br />
37 Years old - Applies to white male also.  <br />
42 Years old - Tax credits for small business would apply for White male also - though there may be some additonal grants.  so we'll call this a mostly applies to white male.<br />
65 Years old - Medicare -- applies to white male also.<br />
67 Years old - retirement -- Applies to white male also.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So we've got what?  3 things that don't apply to white males.  2 of which are unneeded by the white male and exist merely to attempt to balance an unbalanced system as it stands.  and a 3rd - that also mostly applies to white male, but yet still is part of the delicate balancing act.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Really?  Do you begrudge &quot;Julia&quot; for getting birth control assistance?  Or healthcare checkups for her pregnancy?</blockquote>

I spend all day pushing the bounds of our knowledge forward as a society - Today I helped characterize a process that puts a film down one atomic layer at a time and doesn't work unless you do have nigh perfect contamination control.

It's great to not have to worry about getting pregnant, and that, on the whole, I have to worry less about violence.

</div>I helped Dell and Alienware develop their next line of laptops and PCs, and Microsoft improve Secure Boot for Win8, while tracking down a firmware issue on a video card that was causing a problem, all in the hopes of putting out more reliable, faster, and more secure systems.  Some days I do much more, some days, I play games on my android phone while trudging through mundane problems.  <br />
<br />
But Likewise<br />
Dell employs me because I have expert knowledge about internal features of Microsoft's testing SOP and a years long track record of delivering the impossible, and typically ahead of time<br />
I had federally funded loans, and some scholarships that helped me achieve my degree in Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Arizona (On a side note, some of the brain mapping work I did in Doctor Butzin's office while in college just directly enabled an Aunt of mine to have a brain surgery that stopped the shakes she gets from Parkinson's Disease, and has given her life back as she can now function again.  Research all publicly funded)<br />
Colton High school had honors classes that gave me a head start going into college making my first two years of college basically review (Gen eds kill me, wish the jump start program existed when I was in high school) Also publicly funded.<br />
My education before that? All public high school. Paid by public funds.<br />

My wife and I do community events very often and give back as much as we can.<br />

		<blockquote class="restore">Cut Gol some slack guys - he is right. President Obama has no clue what it's like to be a white male. Secretary of State Clinton has no clue what it's like. They can't understand the impossible burden that our privilege places on us. They can't conceive of a world where they aren't judged by the color of their skin or what's between their legs, a world where what they wear isn't evidence of desiring unwanted sexual acts, where code words aren't used instead of saying &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;Hispanic&quot;. They have never known what it's like to be the standard and not treated like deviation. <br />

WHY LORD WHY CAN'T THEY UNDERSTAND THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN????</blockquote>
