If there's a super-major-utterly-polarizing issue in US politics that has the potential to piss off people on <b>all</b> sides of the political party fence, it's asking for more gun control.<br />
<br />
Triple Extra Ungood when done in the wake of a tragedy.<br />
<br />
While I agree with the guy that we need GOOD (as in sensible, logical policy, not much of the bullshit we have out there now saying one type of handgrip is illegal on a gun while another is not on the same gun) gun policy, the reality remains:<br />
<br />
No matter what the fucking policy is, people will still be able to get their hands on guns illegally.<br />
<br />
I know nothing about the shooting other than that it was advertised on 4chan the night before and people died, so I can't speak to whether the gun(s?) was/were legally obtained or not, but that's really not the point when it comes to the lobbying power of firearms enthusiasts.</div>

			<b>A Muslim man in Germany has confessed to strangling his 19-year-old daughter to death as her mother watched, because she was caught shoplifting condoms. The man was planning a forced marriage for his daughter and did not approve of the boy she was dating. </b><br />
<br />
Asadullah Khan, 52, and his wife Shazia, 41, both Ahmadiyya Muslims originally from Pakistan, are accused of murdering their daughter Lareeb for bringing so-called &#8220;dishonor&#8221; on the family, reports German paper Bild.<br />
<br />
They allegedly dressed her body, placed it in a wheelchair, and pushed it off a ravine near their home city of Darmstadt.<br />
<br />
Khan, who speaks no German, was planning a forced marriage for his daughter, as he and his wife had been married in Pakistan. He told the court that he was angered because Lareeb, a dental technician, had stayed away from the family home for a number of nights and had stopped wearing a headscarf.<br />
<br />
Lareeb had met a young man, also from the Ahmadiyya community, of whom the father did not approve. She argued with the father, and their relationship began to break down. Then a letter from the police was delivered to the house, informing them their daughter had shoplifted condoms.<br />
<br />
&#8220;At this point it became clear that there was sexual contact. When I showed the letter to my husband he snapped,&#8221; read a statement from the mother in court.<br />
<br />
Lareeb&#8217;s younger sister, Nida, 14, was sent to stay with a relative on the night of the killing, the court heard. Nida said that her sister had hit her father that night following a row.<br />
<br />
Later, Kahn entered Lareeb&#8217;s room and strangled her as she slept. The mother watched.<br />
<br />
The mother said that she was screaming, but claimed that as a subordinated woman with rheumatism she was powerless to stop her murderous husband.<br />
<br />
Sister Nida denied this: &#8220;My Mama was not suppressed, she could do what she wanted. She used to hit me with a stick,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We were never allowed to talk about her boyfriend. My father used to say my sister should be forcibly married in Pakistan.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Nida, who speaks perfect German, refused to acknowledge her mother in court, Bild reports. She has reportedly moved away from home and has no contact with her parents.

			George Zimmerman incited a slew of backlash on Sunday when he retweeted a photo of the body of Travyon Martin, the unarmed black teenager he shot and killed in February 2012.<br />
<br />
The photo, showing the 17-year-old Martin lying dead in the grass, was posted by Twitter user @SeriousSlav, who included the caption “Z-Man is a one man army,” Raw Story reports.<br />
<br />
Zimmerman's brother, Robert, confirmed to The Huffington Post that George Zimmerman's account, @TherealGeorgeZ, is authentic. <br />
<br />
Twitter deleted the tweet shortly afterwards, according to the New York Daily News, but Zimmerman’s account remains filled with plenty of disturbing tweets, including one that reads “Cops lives matter, black slime doesnt [sic]”.<br />
<br />
Zimmerman's Twitter account made headlines last month when he referred to President Barack Obama as an “ignorant baboon.”<br />
<br />
But tweeting isn’t all that’s kept Zimmerman in the news since a jury acquitted him of second-degree murder in 2012. He faced accusations of domestic violence from his former wife and a woman he had been dating in 2013.<br />
<br />
Zimmerman's former wife said he threatened her family with a gun, but she opted not to press charges.<br />
<br />
Later that year, his ex-girlfriend told police he pointed a gun at her face and smashed her coffee table, though she later recanted the accusations. <br />
<br />
Last year, he was charged with aggravated assault after allegedly hurling a bottle of wine at another girlfriend.<br />
<br />
In August, the Boys &amp; Girls Club denounced Zimmerman's using the organization's name while hawking prints of his painting of the Confederate battle flag.<br />
<br />
Zimmerman had teamed up with a Florida gun store owner to sell the prints, and the two parties initially stated that they would be donating some of the proceeds to the Boys &amp; Girls Club. The charity reacted by issuing a statement saying they were never informed of this plan and requested the pair stop using their name.<br />
<br />
The gun store in question had previously achieved notoriety when the store owner declared his business a “Muslim-free zone.”<br />
<br />
Zimmerman and the store’s owner both claimed that their Confederate flag enterprise had nothing to do with racism.

			OKEMAH, Okla. -- A 4-year-old was allegedly forced by his teacher to write with his right hand, even though he’s left-handed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The child was sent home with a letter about how left-handedness is often associated with evil and the devil.<br />
<br />
Zayde is only 4 years old.<br />
<br />
It's his first year at Oakes Elementary in Okemah, but his mom kept him home Monday after a dispute with his teacher over being left-handed.<br />
<br />
Zayde, like most kids in Pre-K, is learning how to read and write. And like his mom, Alisha, Zayde is a lefty.<br />
<br />
“From picking things up to throwing things, to batting, to writing, to just coloring you’d do at home with him, he’s always, always used his left hand,” Alisha Sands said.<br />
<br />
That was until last week at homework time.<br />
<br />
Alisha asked him why he was writing with his right hand, not his left.<br />
<br />
“I just asked ‘Is there anything his teachers ever asked about his hands?’ And he raises this one and says this one’s bad,” Sands said.<br />
<br />
Alisha sent the teacher a note and got a strong response.<br />
<br />
It was an article calling left-handedness “unlucky,” “evil,” and “sinister.”<br />
<br />
It even says “for example, the devil is often portrayed as left-handed.”<br />
<br />
Alisha couldn’t believe it.<br />
<br />
“It breaks my heart for him because someone actually believes that, believes my child is evil because he’s left handed, it’s crazy,” Sands said.<br />
<br />
She went to the superintendent with the article.<br />
<br />
“There was no suspension of any kind. There was basically nothing done to this teacher,” Sands says, “She told them she thought I needed literature on it.”<br />
<br />
Zayde will likely transfer to another class just two months into the school year.<br />
<br />
“I don’t feel like the school did what they were supposed to for him,” Sands said.<br />
<br />
NewsChannel 4 called the school and were told the superintendent was out Monday, so they transferred us to the principal at Oakes Elementary.<br />
<br />
She said she’s aware of the situation and the district is investigating. She hung up before we could ask any questions.<br />
<br />
Sands is going to file a formal complaint with the Oklahoma Board of Education.

&quot;'Happy Birthday' is finally free after 80 years,&quot; said Randall Newman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, which included a group of filmmakers who are producing a documentary about the song. &quot;Finally, the charade is over. It's unbelievable.&quot;<br />

A spokesman for Warner/Chappell, the publishing arm of Warner Music, said, &quot;We are looking at the court's lengthy opinion and considering our options.&quot;

The sheer impact of this on VW will be huge and it will bring questions to an already weak market in the US that is diesel powered cars.    They have already been the red headed stepchild of the US auto market even Electrics are seen with a better chance in the USDM.   My main question is wondering what this means for the future of VW because they fine potential here is not at all tiny slap on the wrist stuff its tens of billions,   And the damage to &quot;Clean Diesel&quot; marketing is even bigger.   It does not matter if other automakers are doing clean diesel the right way and not cheating,   Its a PR blow to the technology as a whole because consumers are not terribly intelligent.</div>

<br />
Last time it was on several people here were pretty interested but I figured it probably wasn't going to get any coverage in the USA so you might want a heads up.  <br />
<br />
Each team competes in a pool against half a dozen other nations to produce the top 2 teams in each pool.  These then play against each other in knockout events.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy American Football its worth watching a few games if you can find them being broadcast, you might really enjoy it.  This Cup has started off really well and even the 'thanks-for-coming' teams are putting on great displays.  <br />
South Africa got thumped by Japan in the first pool game.  That's so embarrassing they pretty much need to win the entire tournament to ever live this down.<br />
<br />
Tonga did beat USA, but the quality of rugby that the USA team produced has really improved on previous years I thought.</div>
