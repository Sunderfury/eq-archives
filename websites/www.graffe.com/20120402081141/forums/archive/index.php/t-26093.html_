Here's where things got bad, but I had no choice.  I had to be out of my apartment by the first, and as it was I wasn't able to leave until the 2nd.  I have airfare already purchased and was unable to change it.<br />
<br />
Their rep explained that they need to do a deposit on a credit card.  I said I wouldn't have funds on my card until the 1st, and that if he tried to authorize it - it wouldn't work.  I asked if I could send them a money order overnight instead, but no they needed me to fill out these credit card forms and fax them back.<br />
<br />
So I did.<br />
<br />
*ring* <br />
<br />
Me - Hello?<br />
Moving company guy - We have a problem, your credit card didn't go through.<br />
Me - yes, I already told you that it wouldn't, that's why I asked if I could pay the deposit when the movers arrive, or mail you a money order, how we can work this out.<br />
Moving guy - I'll call you back.<br />
<br />
Few minutes later:<br />
<br />
*ring*<br />
Me - Hello?<br />
Moving guy - Ok, overnight us a money order for the amount of your deposit ($138).<br />
Me - Ok, I'll do that now.<br />
<br />
I purchased the money order and since the UPS store was open (remember its Sunday afternoon) I went in bought overnight shipping for it via USPS, since UPS can't deliver to P.O. boxes.<br />
<br />
So the money order went in the mail Monday and should have arrived Tuesday.  I was on the phone with these people several times Tuesday and they insist they never received the money order, which now means that they can't pick up my stuff on Wednesday since their &quot;company policy is that they must receive the deposit by 12am the day prior&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, meanwhile I'm freaking out as to why they didn't get it in the mail.  I couldn't find my receipt slip for the package so I couldn't track it online.  I asked the company if they could just authorize the deposit on my Visa since I had just gotten a deposit and now had the funds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well not to be disrespectful sir, but you gave us a card that didn't work - we aren't going to charge it because that's suspicious&quot;<br />
<br />
Please bear in mind that the 6 people I have talked to at this office have no idea what is going on.  They have to ask me my name and job number numerous times, they have no idea how their company works, and are very very rude.  I however knew better than to be rude since I had no other way to get my stuff out of California.<br />
<br />
Tuesday rolls around and no money order, I finally speak to a supervisor after debating this whole suspicious card thing on the phone with the high school kid / office manager.<br />
<br />
The supervisor asks me to refill out the CC authorization forms and refax them, ok no problem.  They get the deposit off my card and will apply the money order to the entire bill once it does arrive.  <br />
<br />
Now however I won't be able to be present when they pack up my stuff, so instead I leave my best friend to let them in and sign the shipping paperwork.<br />
<br />
Early Thursday morning, before I get ready to leave for the airport to fly out (they would arrive Friday morning to pick up my stuff) I finally find my tracking slip for the money order:<br />
<br />
It was delivered to their office on Tuesday morning at 9am just as it should have been; only they didn't sign for it (which I'd waved /sigh) so the post office left them a notice that they had a package.<br />
<br />
Why in HELL would you not sign for it?  And then WHY would they *not* notice that they had something to SIGN for?!?!<br />
<br />
Also, I was required to leave them %40 of the total move cost on the day they arrived to pick it up.<br />
<br />
$138 10% deposit paid prior to the day they pick up<br />
$138 was already charged on my Visa + the money order already mailed to them for another $138 <br />
<br />
$300 40% more paid on pick up day<br />
<br />
Which means I owe them $113 when they deliver my stuff right?<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
I just got a call from the freight company and was informed that I would need to pay the driver when he arrives on Monday  $2,381.<br />
<br />
On the day of pickup - my friend was looking over the paperwork, and the mover mentioned I had &quot;well over 1000llbs, and included destination&quot; and other charges like breakdown of my desk and another piece of furniture that was supposed to be included in my quote I would be charged &quot;over $2600&quot;.<br />
<br />
So he called me and told me this, and of course I called up the moving company to see, WTF.<br />
<br />
Me - My friend just finished with the movers and was told that I would be charged $2600<br />
Clueless chick that has been rude this entire time - hold please<br />
<br />
Hold<br />
<br />
Hold<br />
<br />
<br />
Hold.....<br />
<br />
Her - They just picked your stuff up, they haven't even weighed the trucked so we have no idea what it is. etc etc.  They aren't back yet either so we don't have a copy of your contract to see the charges either.<br />
<br />
Me - ok so on Monday you guys should have the contract and I can call you back and go over it then?<br />
<br />
Her - sure.<br />
<br />
Monday:<br />
<br />
I called, spoke to yet another person who had no clue, asked me 8 times what my name was and where I was moving from / to.<br />
<br />
She also stated that they didn't have the contract yet, and couldn't help me.  <br />
<br />
Me - Soo, when the guy pulls up outside my house and wants over $2000 to unload my stuff, what am I supposed to do?<br />
Her - give us a call<br />
Me -...<br />
<br />
So there you have it.  If I don't pay them what they want, they won't unload the truck.  <br />
<br />
What am I going to do?!?!<br />

They are notoriouus for raising prices after they have your stuff and they will keep and auction the stuff too!  Iit sounds like this company gave you a lowball estimate in order to get your stuff on the truck, then brought out the &quot;real price&quot; which looks a lot more in line with customary moving charges.   I recently paid about $500 JUST for loading and unloading, not for packing, shipping or any assembly/disassembly.  My full-service (pack, ship, store, unpack) move from Mississippi to Chicago in 1997 with only a college student's stuff cost ~4000.  My full-service move from Chicago to North Carolina, with more heavy furniture was $8500.  A recent quote to pack and move me from NC to FL was ~$7000.<br />

I hope this gets straightened out for you though! Man, I would be freaking.  Never let movers take stuff you can't live without either, like computers or heirlooms (or in my case, my CD's or DVD's).</div></div><hr />

I hate scam artists like this. Filthy thieves if you ask me. Chances are good a lawyer would do nothing but tie you up in court on the opposite coast from where you live, and they know this. Plus, their contracts are airtight, having been tested in court before -- many times -- I'm sure.<br />
<br />
In the future, rent a Uhaul, pay some local movers to load your stuff, drive it to your destination, and pay another local crew to unload it. Potential for abuses abound but are more under your control that way.<br />

Sooo my mom is going to use her visa when they get here and then after they leave, call her CC company and dispute the charge.  If for some reason they won't take the visa then we'll get a money order and report it stolen once they drive off.  <br />
<br />
On a more practical note, I'm going to take pictures of the movers, their truck and license plate info for posting on that website Logan linked.  I will have them blacklisted and I'm also going to report them to the BBB.

One wonders how accurate these schmendricks are though when they report their income to the IRS.  :evil: <br />
<br />
When my family needed a mover after our folks died and we had to empty the house, we went with a mover that came recomended. Granted, there was an attempt by the driver to scam extra money on delivery but that got squashed fast. All told, I think the bill was for about $2k and that was nearly 5 years ago.<br />
<br />
Moving recently from the Catskills in NY to Erie, PA cost me ~$700 renting a U-haul and loading/unloading myself. The fuel alone probably would've cost you that much using a U-Haul from CA to FL.<br />
<br />
Honestly, $2k is probably in line for the move unless you had next to nothing that they moved. (We didn't have that much either except a piano which is what upped the price and which was the object of scamming on the other end.)<br />
<br />
Anyone who's moved around much have some insights on how to handle this crap? Do moving companies pull this crap when a major company is paying moving expenses too?</div></div><hr />

Well it probably won't work here but sometimes just teh threat of gettign a lawyer invovled can lead to a positive outcome. It would seem to me that if you have a copy of all estimates given thena  lawyer woudl be able to do something about it. Plus if you win the moving company shold have to pay lawyers fees too, then they can see what it is like to be screwed too. <br />
<br />

If for some reason they won't take the visa then we'll get a money order and report it stolen once they drive off.<br />
<br />
Why don't you do that anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
We got quotes from 4-5 movers each time.  If they didn't give a quote of &quot;not to exceed x$&quot;, we didn't use them.  The quotes were based on mileage for the most part, with weight coming into play slightly.  <br />

A deposit was required, and the balance due at delivery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alikat Astrae</div><div class="date">December 13th, 2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trick is to have 5 or six of your meanest-looking friends there to greet the truck driver on arrival.  If he tries to inflate the price, beat the living crap out of him and unload the truck yourselves, then pay him what you agreed on and inform him that this was &quot;just a taste&quot; of what he has coming to him if you ever so much as hear his name ever again.  For bonus points you can keep the truck driver and his partners in a set of giant glass jars in your basement, and feed them nothing but stale double-stuff Oreos.  Or, you could skin the truck driver, and wear the truck driver's skin, and use the truck driver's skin as a gateway to another dimension....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaymus</div><div class="date">December 13th, 2004, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, demand a detailed invoice for services rendered and what they based their estimate on.<br />
<br />
Second, consult a lawyer if you have not already done so. Low-balling an estimate to get a job and jacking the price up by ~350% after they've picked up the order borders on fraud.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't report the money order stolen...you could get into trouble yourself for fraud or perjury since you usually have to sign an affidavit to that effect. Disputing the credit card charge would definitely be an option though and would require the company to justify the charge and your estimate is likely to hold a lot more weight with the CC company that with the moving company. You'll also have a company with larger resources than you have going to bat for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zedd</div><div class="date">December 13th, 2004, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, they insisted I had over 2700 lbs worth of stuff.  They presented certificates of the truck weight &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; being loaded with my stuff.<br />
<br />
On top of that, they charged me $750 for &quot;packing&quot; services and materials, because smaller boxes and some small suitcases had to be packed into larger boxes.<br />
<br />
So far, dishes, a small fountain and my HP 750 All-in-One have been destroyed, but of course I don't expect to get anything for my stuff.<br />
<br />
Best I can do is report them to that website logan linked, and the BBB.  <br />
<br />
Really tired of thinking about this right now.  I hate stuff like this.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you all so much for your concern and advice !<br />

I've heard of companys misquoting and having to stick with the price they gave and take losses, but I honestly don't know much about it.  Sucks getting hit with that bill though, I hope disputing the charge works for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khaymus</div><div class="date">December 14th, 2004, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, standing by your quote is something a good business usually does. It's irresponsible in the extreme to offer an estimate like what they did for a move when they absolutely MUST have known that it would cost far more than they quoted, then more than tripling it after they have his stuff. I'd be interested in knowing exactly what they based their estimate on to bring forth such a low price.<br />
<br />
Wish you the best of luck on getting some justice out of this...or, failing that at least some vengeance by staining their reputation. In that vein...have you thought about talking to a reporter about your experience? One of the consumer advocate types, perhaps?</div></div><hr />
