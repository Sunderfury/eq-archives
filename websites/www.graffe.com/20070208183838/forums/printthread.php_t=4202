			<div><strong>Raw Dimaonds and Imbueing Gems. Finally some answers.</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div><br /> Ok this is the siutation on what raw diamonds are used for. How to imbue, why to imbue and how to obtain the spells.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get the the imbued spells that are for my class (i.e. druids get Imbue Storms).<br />
<br />
A: You DO NOT get your imbue spell from the normal person you turn the partchments too. There is a seperate person that you hand your partchment(s) to that will ONLY give out Imbue spells for your class. Locate &quot;Noirin Khalen' in POK and speak with this NPC. This NPC is the NPC that gives out the Imbued Spell(s). The reason for this is because all the other normal spells that are given are random. So, many classes might not want an imbued spell given how hard it is to get a partchment. So now you have a choice to get imbued spells or not.<br />
<br />
Q: How are imbued items made. And what are all these Raw Diamonds im getting in the planes.<br />
<br />
A: HOLD ON TO THEM. Welcome to the next level of gems. Raw Diamonds is the base for every imbued plane gem in the game. To create an imbued gem you need a raw diamond, another componant, and the proper caster to imbue them together to make the gem. For instance. a &quot;white daimond of Justice&quot; is made by a raw diamond and akaline etched stone. Give it to a class that has the spell &quot;Imbue Justice&quot; and they can make it for you. Much like how viels of mana are made.<br />
The recip list of all the imbued gems (most of them) are located here: <a href="http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_PoP.htm" target="_blank">www.eqtraders.com/secrets...es_PoP.htm</a> under Misc section.<br />
<br />
Q: What are imbued gems used for<br />
A: They are used for new ALL/ALL jewlery in Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
Q: Any stats yet? Just one from what I can find.<br />
A: Not really. Given how hard Partchments are to come by these days its not as if any of us are going to waste them on an imbue spell. Most of us want our new buffs/nukes/heals, etc.<br />
<br />
Bone Bracelet of Corruption<br />
MAGIC WRIST<br />
AC +15<br />
DEX +5 WIS +5 +INT 5 +AGI 5, sv disease +25 sv poison +10<br />
ALL ALL <br />
<br />
This is just a sample of what can be made with jewlery now. Im personaly very excited to see what else is out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are imbued spell scrolls droppable<br />
A: Yes<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope i cleared some things up on what the deal was with imbued gems, jewlery and raw daimonds. If i were you I would hold on to your raw diamonds. They are bound to be worth ALOT more then blue diamonds. Im also very happy as a 250 jewler that we are finally getting some nice things to sell to people.  <br /></div>
