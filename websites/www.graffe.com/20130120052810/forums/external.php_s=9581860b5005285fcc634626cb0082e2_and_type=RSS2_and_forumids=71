I highly recommend going to youtube and watching this at 1080p full screen. Just so you don't lose interest before you even start watching the video, DCS World is FREE. You can buy additional modules and play it online or offline. I think this is one of the ultimate sandbox games. You can have as much control as you want or as little. <br />
<br />
I could go into a lot more, but video does that.</div>

<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">

		<hr />
		
			Black Isle was one of the great game studios of its era, but the the visionary company that existed in the ’90s and early oughts is no more, and its revival is something else entirely — something that seems more sketchy every day.<br />
 <br />
After months of silence since its August announcement, the new Black Isle opened its virtual doors last Thursday with an unsurprising mission: to make a game by taking your money. <br />
<br />
We’ve all grown pretty accustomed to the crowdsourcing movement. Some projects — like the ones run by inXile and Obsidian, the two studios where most ex-Black Isle personnel ultimately landed — are probably even worth checking out. But the new Black Isle — somehow still backed by Interplay, a company that itself seems rather up in the air — offers little by way of incentives or explanation. The studio’s main site is being hosted on something called “InvestedIn”, which as far as I can tell is like Kickstarter, but without all the pesky limitations that keep Kickstarter projects honest. It doesn’t so much as show the total amount raised so far.<br />
<br />
Contributors aren’t even funding a full game (just a “prototype”), and access to the finished product is never promised at all. Instead, contributors get access to a “special forum”, though only donations over $US20 earn you posting privileges — otherwise, bafflingly, it’s “look, don’t touch”. The top 20 funders, god help them, get gold forum badges and a “Certificate of Valor” (clearly much better than the Certificates of “Merit” and “Recognition” offered to $US10 and $US20 contributors, respectively). Oh, and they’ll be taking your money immediately, eschewing the expected 30-day funding period required by sites like Kickstarter.<br />
 <br />
Does that mean that you won’t get your money back even if the project fails? I can’t be sure, since representatives of Interplay and the new Black Isle don’t seem to want to chat. But as it so often is in post-apocalyptic games, the writing here seems to be on the walls.<br />
 <br />
The game itself — dubbed “Project V13&#8243; — raises even more questions, though an update to the studio’s Facebook page yesterday described it in more detail than anything that had been posted previously. It described a game with an atypical post-apocalyptic setting — “endless flat plains of brown sand are not in the cards” — and equal parts SimCity and Fallout.<br />
<br />
Yet the update also revealed that Black Isle had to scrap most or all of the work that went into Project V13, previously the codename for the Fallout MMO (Interplay no longer owns the rights — the word “Fallout” is even bleeped out in the studio’s plea video), which had been “in development for years”. So that leaves…what? They don’t say, and it seems even they don’t really know.<br />
 <br />
On the other hand, that at least was better than their last update, posted the day before. Here’s an excerpt:<br />
 <br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Something you should think about before donating or telling your friends to donate. You might be the cause of a small number of people sitting in their cramped, dark f****** shelter depressed because they’re not sitting in their cramped, dark f****** for real because the world didn’t really end.<br />
 <br />
Got that? Some people won’t be happy you’re helping.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>No, I can’t make head or tails of that, either. And I honestly can’t tell whether the new Black Isle is a brazen scam or simply a project helmed by misguided game developers who haven’t fully grasped the concept at the core of the crowdsourcing movement: that those contributing get something in return.<br />
 <br />
Two of the original Black Isle’s workforce, Chris Taylor and Mark Green, have indeed returned, yet still it seems that the studio has been resurrected in name only. Perhaps most damning of all is the fact that they seem to be ignoring all requests for clarification — my own questions remain unanswered, and the story is apparently the same across every site that’s covered this debacle so far. What’s up with the weird updates? What’s been happening at Black Isle for the last four months? Who is actually creating this game?<br />
 <br />
If you’ll forgive me donning my tin foil hat for a moment, I’d hypothesize that they launched this right before the holidays so they’d have an excuse to ignore the media’s queries while raking in cash from the poor saps who haven’t done their homework. That, or maybe they were hoping the world would end after all and they’d never have to answer to this.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>CES is coming up this week, I believe, and one of the first cool new things I've seen people talking about is Nvidia's new handheld gaming device. <a href="http://shield.nvidia.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shield.nvidia.com/</a><br />
<br />
It looks like a standard dual stick console controller with a small screen attached. It comes with android installed, but I think it's primary intent is going to be to stream games from a gaming PC, essentially taking your PC with you wherever you go. Steam and their new &quot;Big Picture mode&quot; is mentioned specifically, and I wonder if this is the project Valve has not been talking about.<br />
<br />
It bears a resemblance to OnLive, which was a great idea that sort of petered out for various reasons. The tech geeks on the forum I saw this on seem to be excited about Nvidia's streaming solution, but I know absolutely nothing about it.<br />
<br />
As cool and daring as this is, I have to wonder if there is a market for such a device. If you want a portable gaming machine you are likely to get one with exclusive games, if you hate consoles and only play on PCs, you probably aren't going to want to give up keyboard and mouse for a gamepad.<br />
<br />
So I know there are a lot of you that don't like portables, or only play games on the PC. Would this interest you? What would your pricepoint be? <br />
<br />
I can't see paying more than $100 myself, but doubt it will go lower than $200, possibly more. And there is the one small caveat that you need a kepler based gpu to host the games on in the first place (kepler is their newest line, the 660s or whatever).</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I can't say the new year is starting off with a bang, but there are still several titles I am personally excited for. Arguably the &quot;biggest&quot; release of the month is the reboot of Devil May Cry, but the PS3 is also getting an exclusive jrpg years in the making in the form of Ni no Kuni. <br />
<br />
When Ni no Kuni was first announced, it's attempt at recreating Studio Ghibili's artistic style was amazing. Graphics have improved enough in general over the years where it is no longer brain melting, but still quite appealing if you are a fan of their work. I've been looking to this one for awhile, but I have quite a few jrpgs I haven't gotten around to playing yet at the moment.<br />
<br />
The DMC remake is being made by Ninja Theory (Enslaved, Heavenly Sword), a company known for good stories but somewhat mediocre combat. Combined with a redesign of the main character, and fans have been complaining since day one. I, however, am optimistic. My dilemma isn't whether or not to get it, but for what platform and for what pricepoint (this sort of game, no matter how good, always seems to drop in price fast).<br />
<br />
I've got a couple runner's up games I want to bring attention to as well. The first is Anarchy Reigns, a game I am not myself supremely hyped for but thought some might like to know about. It's this kind of open arena fighter/brawler based around characters from Mad World, along with having Bayonetta as a DLC character.<br />
<br />
Finally, Kickstarter has had a rather large number of space sim projects announced, but one of them is apparently done. Much like with FTL, the developers of Strike Suit Zero only needed money to finish the game, so it is supposed to come out this month. I believe the game is done in Freespace 2's style, with inspiration from other sources (such as Gundam and Homeworld) making themselves known in various ways. One of the ships you fly is a transformable mech for example. <br />
<br />
I might add some videos later.<br />
