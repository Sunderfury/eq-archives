		<div>May have this in the wrong section, but I figure it will get enough traffic.<br />
<br />
Recently went on hiatus in EQ, and a buddy gave me a 10-day free trial of WoW.  It sat around for a bit, but I did eventually give it a shot.<br />
<br />
I''m not trying to start a argument on the relative values of the games, but here is my 2 cents.  I'm posting this so I can get some corrections about gameplay, or a few acknowledgements from palyers that some of the problems have been identified and are being looked at.<br />
<br />
I have tried each race, and each class at least to level 10.  My "main" would be a mage in his 30s.  Blizzard has created a very neat game.  It is fun.  It appears to be something I may play until EQ gets its act together or goes away.  I do prefer EQ in general.  WoW has simplified a number of things which make it a better time killer, though I can't get "attached" to my character as I can in EQ.  I play on a PvP server, <br />
<br />
!, ?:  I like this to a degree.  The quest identifiers are relatively nice.  Its easy to see if you are in a "good" area for your level.  I wish they would be a bit better about making these appear on the mini-map.  That seems hit or miss when looking to complete a quest.  I'd also prefer a different color.<br />
<br />
Griffon Masters:  I think you should be able to "buy" a route without actually traveling there, make it much more expensive the first time, but still available.  It's not like we are training the griffons.  There should be a toggle that makes a griffon master show as a green dot at least on the mini-map if you want it on.  A fast forward option on the griffons would be nice as well.  Translocators please.  Without the Fast forwar you should at least be able to daisy chain routes so I can program the flight from deep elfland to deep humanville and go make dinner, eat dinner, read a book...<br />
<br />
Exploration XP:  Nice, but someone needs to fix the elf areas.  Getting areas to open up in some of those areas is like pulling teeth.  Buyable in-game maps that you can right click to "explore" areas woudl be nice.  Maybe have them show up, but be light grey until you actually get there.<br />
<br />
Groups:  Random people tend to believe its who can push the button faster.  Granted I have not hit 60, but it seems there are alot more "dumb" people playing this game.  I am constantly amazed at the people who throw group invites without saying anything first.  As a side note, if you play a priest, and have no heals hotbuttoned, please tell your party.<br />
<br />
Auction House:  Could do a whole post on this.  Without analyzing the whole she-bang--Overall I prefer the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Level 60:  The level 60 game is strictly for gear enhancement?  This scares me more than any other thing.  No "gear" I have seen yet really jumps out, but I'm not in that range yet.  Are they planning on some form of AA's?<br />
<br />
Quest rewards:  Very irritating getting a quest that rewards you with your choice of 5 items you can't use.  At least post the "sell value" of the items so we can get the most cash.<br />
<br />
Gear:  Might just be mages, but it appears there are no significant alternatives to a 2 handed staff.  If you are using something else you are walking around just for show.  On that note...  I would have sworn someone said that you dont have to wear a robe.  I dislike robes, but other than a few very minor stints I have been forced to wear robes.  I hope at the high end, I am not stuck wearing nothing but robes.  Though, I know I am.  Hats.  Man them are some ugly hats.  I thought EQ clashed bad, but man.  However, If you get matching items in this, it does work much better.  Can you "dye" items in this after they are created or if you receive them as a reward?<br />
<br />
Appearance:  Man, I wish you could change your appeaance after you get in the game.  Also, human males need a nose job.  I don't know who animated the shading on human noses, but you are fired.<br />
<br />
Elves:  No real elves sucks ass.<br />
<br />
Downtime/Lag:  Good lord, 2 day patches.  Lag out the ass, and I'm on a low population server (if those ratings can be believed)  Ironforge is a pain in the arse walking through.  Whoever put the pits near the bank/AH needs to get fired too.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills:  Overall I like these, though I'm not sure why some are considered seperate.  Alchemy/hebalism, Skinning/Leatherworking, Mining/Smithing.  I have no issues with seperate skill numbers, but seems foolish to take one without the other.<br />
Questions here...<br />
Is tinkering practically self-only?  IE its mostly for building stuff for yourself?<br />
Is it intended that other people can skin your kills but herbs/mines are strictly first come/first serve?<br />
Ive noticed that smithing sometimes requires leatherworking products?  many others like that?  havent seen that in alchemy, other than maybe fishing.<br />
<br />
Have they talked about any expansions yet?<br />
<br />
I REALLY don't like that dwarves/gnomes &amp; orcs/trolls share the same starting area.<br />
<br />
Do they have any type of <b><i>in game </i></b> rational for the lack of alliance/horde communication or is this the man behind the curtain we dont ask about?<br />
<br />
Overall, Like I said, good game.  Don't get bent out of shape on those complaints, lots of good things, but I don't need feedback on the good things.<br />
<br />
Last thing said:  The 10 day pass is an incredible idea.  I would never have played without it.  I'll probably become a customer at least for a few months too.</div>

		<div>Well, i cant really dipute anything you have said since they are your personal opinions and are entirely valid.  However, i happen to like alot of the things you dislike.<br />
<br />
Stupid people:  I think this is more of a result that the game is new and alot of MMO newbs are playing the game.  As the game and players mature the "stupid" people should be less evident.  Ohh, they'll still be stupid people.....they will just play the game better.<br />
<br />
AH: yes, it certainly is lacking.  Hopefully the continue to add functionality to it in future patches.<br />
<br />
Equipment:  I perfer WoW's itemization to EQ's in general.  There arent huge gaps in player ability due solely to equipment.  I like the fact that a casual player outfitted in full strat/scholo/UBRS gear will be able to perform just as well as a player outfitted in full MC/Onxyia gear.  Now it does take a bit away from the powergamer achiever types......but it also doenst put up a huge roadblock for newer players joinging in on the raiding ranks.<br />
<br />
Elves:  You're completely wrong here.....the fact that there are elves to begin with  sucks ass.   Goddamn fairy elves.  (but seriously, try to think of the lore as less Tolkien and a little more origional, will make living in the world easier)<br />
<br />
Lag: It certainly can be bad at times.....but it has been improving steadily over the last month or two.  I expect it to continue to get better.</div>

Yes.<br />
Engineering creates a plan which smiths need to make, so engineers can use the result.<br />
Tailoring and engineering use a lot of skins.<br />
Leatherworking uses a bunch of different cloth types.<br />
Tailoring, engineering, and leatherworking all use different potions.<br />

ditto<br />
<br />
Groups: ya, lots of dumb people, but it seems to improve as levels increase.<br />
<br />
Auction House:  i really dont get this one. imo, the only problem with the AH is that the search function is somewhat limited (cant search for "of the Monkey", etc..).  though id much rather be able to sell stuff in the AH and go about my business then sitting there afk all day.  and the lag/spam, from all of the players being in the bazaar, isnt nearly as bad.<br />
<br />
Level 60:  you said you played on a PvP server. personally, pvp is the only thing id  want to do at level 60, the less i need to get uber gear, or raid, the better.<br />
<br />
Gear:  it does seem lots of times staves can seem alot better than 1h/off-hand, but its not always the case. the <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?i=3228" target="_blank">Illusionary Rod</a>(drop) is a very good staff from Scarlet Monastery. however, the combination of <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=4015" target="_blank">Hypnotic Blade</a>(drop) and <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=4028" target="_blank">Prophetic Cane</a>(horde quest reward), both from SM, is quite similar in stats, having less spirit and slightly less stamina, but more int.<br />
<br />
Appearance:  well, i dont really like alliance races in general (besides dwarf), but thats why i play horde.<br />
<br />
Elves:  never been a big fan of elves personally.<br />
<br />
Downtime/Lag:  my server almost never gets bad lag, and downtime is usually limited to a few hours on tuesdays.<br />

		<div>I only want quest turn-ins to show on the mini-map. That'd be enough for me.<br />
There should be quests tucked away in corners of the content for the explorers.  Like the feller atop the mountain in dun murogh.  Full-on quest radar would kill that.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of buyable maps to uncover parts of your overland map, in lieu of getting exploration experience.  I also agree with the desire to allow people to buy 'stringed' fligh paths.  Take me from Aerie Peak to BB please, I'm gonna go make a sandwich.<br />
Speeding up travel itself, I am against.<br />
<br />
Changing hairstyles and dye-ing I agree with, but wouldn't prioritize very high at all.<br />
<br />
Engineering: very much self-only.  Probably the most fun tradeskill though.<br />
Most tradeskills do have quite a bit of interreliance for items (for the stuff you <i>want</i> to make anyway).<br />
<br />
Gnomes/Trolls ... meh. It beats only having 6 player races, and the lore doesn't support much else.  Sometimes I wonder if they weren't meant to be first expansion player races, but got pushed up.<br />
<br />
As for AAs... I'd rather have my talent points from 10-60 than get em all at the end, thanks.<br />
<br />
No cross-faction communication... I prefer it.  I'm much happier with the more Dark Age-ish view of factions than the EQ-ish lack of factions.  Certainly artificial, but it beats the alternative, imo.</div>

		<div>Note on the Engineering:  Yes, most of it requires engineering to use, several quests use it - For example a Horde Quest wants a Deadly Blunderbus - THere's an Alliance(possibly Horde too) that wants 8 High-Explosive Bombs + 8 Unstable Triggers..  <br />
Most of the Engineering stuff is Tradeable - but not useable unless you have engineering (there are a few exceptions to this)- There are two paths to Engineering Goblin, and Gnome - Gnome makes the most Gadgets, Goblin makes more and bigger and better Bombs - with a few gadgets.  With Most being tradeable, while you may not be able to make a certain Item, You can trade for it from an Engineer of the Opposite discipline.</div>

		<div>I agree completely on exporing the night elf zones, I hated ashenvale because the discovery areas were so odd in there.  Most other zones I have been to might have 1 weird area, but that whole zone is weird.<br />
<br />
Regarding the level 60 game, soon (whatever that means) battlegrounds and the pvp honor system will be in and that will be something else to do.  Looking further down the road, hero classes will be added, but I think that won't be for awhile, but it will be a way to advance your character at 60.  Right now, there is pvp for fun, pve raiding, loot, quests, faction, etc. at 60.<br />
<br />
For quest rewards, most are pretty good about having at least one thing you can use, but yeah, a few need to add some stuff.  Not a huge deal, but something I would like to see them update and have new quests be good about.<br />
<br />
For 2h staves for casters, typically they are better, but there are some exceptions.  There are always a few daggers, maces, and swords that were built with casters in mind and plenty of decent offhand items for casters.<br />
<br />
Downtime and lag over my whole playing time have not been excessive and they have been generous at adding free days when servers are down for an extended period of time.  Definitely a problem, but it has been improving at least on my server and they are still working on it.<br />
<br />
For tradeskills, I can see what you mean, but the nice thing about them being seperated is that you can choose to just be a gatherer and sell on the AH, just be a producer/user or pick skills that compliment each other.  <br />
<br />
No word about expansions yet, but they have free content updates planned.  No timetable on things, but they are working on battlegrounds and pvp honor and always on more high end pve raid content and instances.<br />
<br />
While it would have given us more world to explore with each race having a unique starting area, it at least is explained from a lore perspective why things are the way they are.<br />
<br />
No in game rational for not being able to communicate with the opposite faction.  It is one of those where enforcing an illogical game mechanic makes the game work the way they want it to.  Part of it is keeping people from insulting, taunting. etc. more than with the standard emotes.  There are plenty of people who disagree on this point, but they are pretty adamant about keeping the factions seperate as far as helping each other out, they want the tension to be there whenever you see an opposite faction member.<br />
<br />
I hope you continue to enjoy the game :)</div>

Mordlu, I agree that is sad to have no real elves. But, game lore has the elves being magically evolved trolls, which I think is great. In fact the game seems repleat with magically evolved races.<br />
<br />
And, boy I couldnt agree with you more about the newbie idiot players. I figure its so deeply easy to level that most who do never learn a thing about how to play well. Dont figure that will ever change without major game modifications that will never happen.</div>

				!, ?: I like this to a degree. The quest identifiers are relatively nice. Its easy to see if you are in a "good" area for your level. I wish they would be a bit better about making these appear on the mini-map. That seems hit or miss when looking to complete a quest. I'd also prefer a different color.

		<div>Quests on the map: Most quests are clustered at the center of population for the zone. The rest represent `discovery' quests. Seems fine to me, and there's enough quests that if you miss one it's not really a character crisis.<br />
<br />
Buy Griffon Routes: No, I like the exploration element. The travel links are short and fast enough that it can give the world a scale without being boring like EQ's 40 minute boats and 15 minute spires. Certainly PoP books, convenient as they were, destroyed any sense of "world" in EQ.<br />
<br />
Exploration XP: The problem with this is they tied map regions to landmarks. Thus you can ride through a non-mapped area and not get it mapped. Of course this tells you that you haven't fully explored the area, which has some benefits.<br />
<br />
Groups:  Pickup groups are a crapshoot, especially in a new game with a huge userbase. No news here.<br />
<br />
Auction House: Don't do drugs.<br />
<br />
Level 60:  No. The level 60 game is meant to have PvE advancement through gear, PvP advancement through status and gear and character progression through hero quests. It's just that most isn't in the game and Blizzard are damn slow about adding. On the positive side much of the high level content is of a very high quality.<br />
<br />
Gear:  Dye sucks. Color is a clue to recognising the identity of the armor.<br />
<br />
Appearance:  Who cares? WoW is meant to be played at medium view distance. How often do you really get close enough to stare into another characters eyes and note the cleft of their chin?<br />
<br />
Elves:  "real" elves?<br />
<br />
Downtime/Lag:  Yeah, Blizzard have issues.<br />
<br />
Alchemy is basically a primary producer itself. All the potions are tradeable and our highest end abilities are largely about supporting other trades. Largely transmuting components for smithing.<br />
<br />
Cross faction comm: Lack of communication works to clearly split the factions which is a good setup for PvP (without trashtalk). I'm not a great fan on how it reduces PvE opportunities. Especially if you're horde with an anemic population.<br />
<br />
Really WoW has lots of issues at the moment and there's lots that could be done better. It will be very interesting to see how it grows. However even in its current stage I think it's the best PvE MMORPG out there at the moment.</div>

		<div>As a side note...  I actually meant the "?" NPCs should always show up on the map, not the quest givers.<br />
<br />
In a similiar vein, the toggle switch to show griffon masters would fall under this category.  Once you find them, they can be displayed on the minimap.  (Really any stationary vendorish type person)<br />
<br />
Even better if they showed up on the overhead map.<br />
<br />
~<br />
<br />
Another point.  I understand the rationale for grouped starting areas, perhaps I should have clarified, I feel cheated in that Once I have played a dwarf to level 10, perhaps even 20, I already know 95% of the quests I would be doin for a gnome.  (same with orc/troll)  I have no in-game issues with them grouped.  Thought that would be obvious.<br />
<br />
~~<br />
<br />
Same with the min-maxing on the staffs.  Kaelon, unless you have some kind of rationale to back up the sword dagger thing, I'm sticking to my guns.  Ive seen 2 offhand items, and neither warrant dropping the stats I get from staffs for (maybe) more dps with a weapon.  If it wasn't for cosmos making so many extra "buttons" I wouldnt even have "attack" keyed.<br />
<br />
~~<br />
<br />
Yes, REAL elves.  Whizbangs beta write-up mentioned it, and that was the primary reason I didn't buy the game.  Shevarash is the name of my night-elf attempt (bonus points for identifying its source).  I find it very appropriate.  It still disgusts me that they arent in there, but apparently are still around enough to train me in stormwind.<br />
<br />
I find it immensly amusing people chastise me for being tolkenesqe in my desire for "real" elves but themselves buy into the robed and pointy hat theme.  If I ever get access to a time machine, in my first 5 stops, one will be to drop in on Tolkein and tell him to "leave off the hat".  I am much more influenced by AD&amp;D than Tolkein (granted a subtle difference, but it is a difference)<br />
<br />
Last comment on the fast forwarding and the whole "keep the world size pertinent" and it would ruin the enjoyment of travel.  I think the best way to establish my view on that argument is with the classic joke.<br />

<br />
1.  I agree that there are people that have no clue how to group, but that was also a problem with EQ. (one of the reasons I left...my main was a warrior so I had to group...and PU groups, well...they suck most of the time  ;) )<br />
<br />
2.  Automated flight paths and teleporters - no...they take away from the immersion factor.<br />
<br />
3.  Buying maps - don't like that one either...it takes away from the "newness" factor.  Besides, if it's that big of a deal just go to Thottbot (or a number of other sites) and get maps.  I think you can also install Cosmos and it has maps.<br />
<br />
4.  Downtime - yep, that's not good...but it seems to be getting better (and I play on AD - a high pop server)<br />
<br />
5.  AA's - hate the idea.  That was just another mindless time sink used by SoE to disguise a lack of balanced content options.  It also further increased the gap between the uber raiders and the rest of us since they had access to much better xp zones then people like me did.<br />
<br />
6.  Auction house - good idea, but the implementation needs some work.</div>

</div>  Not always the case.  I usually check Thottbot when there's nothing that I can use, because occasionally there's a good-sized descrepency in the values of the rewards.  In the <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?q=1031" target="_blank">Hurley Blackbreath</a> quest, for example, the cleaver is worth 4g 10s and the cudgel is only worth 3g 1s.  1g's nothing to sneeze at!  ;)  It'd be nice if they'd allow you to choose an amount of money as your reward that's equal to the sell value of the most valuable choice for those who can't (or won't) use any of the rewards.</div>

</div>Nonsense there is a very real statistical difference between different talent builds. And, the built in game level based miss/resist rates completely remove skill from the equation if you attempt to fight something only a few levels to high (Im currently prepared to say this was a technical design mistake). WoW is impressive (possibly revolutionary) in its quest immersion, but not in its technical design choices. They are all standard clones of what came before (this is mostly a good thing).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, fishing has got to be the stupidest thing they did. I'd imagine some folks like it (some folks like anything), but the implementation needs thrown out and something new added.</div>

I think I have found the problem.  We are not playing the same game.  The game I'm playing is so much based upon the min/maxing of loot mountains of code have been put in place to automate the distribution of loot.  Including the "opt out/auto roll" for green items, round robbin looting, and an entire system where you can buy/sell items to min max yourself.  This game revolves around min/maxing.  No mob is going to see a wizard with a sword and go "Whoa! a wizard with a sword.  He is going to be a difficult target"  You say the offhand is still viable, and that if I haven't figured that out by level 30 I've lost WoW.  Please link me some quests that I can do that will provide me with an off-hand and primary that is better than most of the staffs.<br />
<br />
I also agree the fishing is a royal pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind.  I enjoy the game.  I am not here to scream this game is shitty.  There are tons of things I really like about it.  But I still believe most of my complaints are very valid, and haven't seen much to counter them.</div>

<br />
Walking by water to raise fishing skill, what are you talking about. Fishing is one tiny step different in WoW than EQ? In EQ you hit a button (its labeled fishing) and the rnd takes over. In WoW you hit that same button and then act as the first phase of the rnd and then the rnd takes over anyway. The first phase rnd is just stupid given the streamlining in all other tradeskills.</div>

You're not looking hard enough.  I've played with a staff for exactly 3 levels in this game.  The rest of the time I've played with a sword/off-hand item combo that has always had comparable or better stats than the staff alone.  You've already said you don't care about dps, so you should have no excuse for not finding a +int sword and a +int/sta/spi off hand item to go with it.  <br />
<br />
I've been using the Sword of Serenity since level 43 or so, and have matched various off hand items with it that have made it equal to the Illusionary Rod every step of the way.</div>

Maybe as a mage spirit isn't important for you but i can assure as a priest in the end game, having 150 spirit is crippling compared to the priest with 300. This is most likely due to spirit being perhaps the number 2, possibly number 1, stat for our class. It will take you twice as long, and that could be a matter of seconds or minutes, to regen your mana with 150 spirit over 300. In a place like MC, this could mean life or death for the raid as several healers in unison keeping up their mana is required. If one healer fails to make the cut, the others will have to pick up the slack but that can only be done so much before they too need to regen.</div>

It's annoying, but what's really annoying is that the Horde has essentially no choices for the teenage levels, since there are so few quests in Silverpine Forest. I hate The Barrens, also. My Druid finally made it out and is now hunting in Ashenvale/Hillsbrad.<br />

They have a rational for lack of Alliance/Horde communication at level 1:  young Orcs don't know how to speak Common, and young Humans don't know how to speak Orcish.<br />

At level 60, though, there needs to be some way to learn at least one of the opposing faction's languages.</div>

It was alot to quote, and I'm sure that got the point across.  Take a step back.  I definitely think you are looking at my post from the wrong perspective.  My laundry list of complaints suggestions are the things I do not like about the game, and would prefer to have corrected.  I did not post a list of the things I liked.<br />

Yyidth may be a bit blunt in describing your reading comprehension, but you have definitely missed the spirit and intent of this post.  You seem to be filling in my statements with what you expect a pro-EQ/anti-WoW person to be saying.  I am not anti-WoW.<br />

No, I did not say AAs should be used in WoW.  I do <b>suspect</b> that I will want <b>something</b> to be added to allow a form of character advancement other than gear to the post 60 game.  Be it continually adding levels so that you are always leveling/dual classing/something so its not continual raiding.  I like raiding, but if thats all I have to do, I won't be playing long.<br />
<br />
I do use EQ terms in framing my questions.  I asked about AAs because people know what I mean.<br />

Did you play EQ?  Fishing was just like any other trade skill.  Mind numbing button pushing.  Walking by water didnt get you skill ups.  The reason I described it as being a pain in the ass is they made it into a minigame.  Fast flex the finger for a fish.  Nice illiteration, but tiresome in a different way.  And in WoW you can just "walk by" a forge and have your smithing go up.  It even has a "create all" button.  I wouldnt complain as much, and I suspect others would not have either, if all the skills had mini-games associated with it.  Fishing has one, it is different, thus it gets complaints.  Surprisingly the complaint is not related to EQ in any way shape form or fashion.  Tell me on cooking, where is the risk, reward or challenge in that?  You could say finding the meat, but it would have been much easier for them to have "lures" made from bits of animals to acquire in order to fish.  It would have been much easier to program, and more in line with the other tradeskills.<br />

For the other points...<br />
The vests that are sold are apparently what I need to be finding.  Eamin pointed those out and I can assure you I will be looking for them.  I, incorectly, assumed it based off of some "vest" I had that had the appearance of a robe.  Probably just a fluke, but I was pissy - and its a shame that my first "vest" was bugged.  I didnt mention the pointy hats too much, because they do have a number of options that are tolerable.  Thanks.  I'll have to see if I can look up that early quest with the robe looking vest.<br />
<br />
The off-hand appears to be viable, just not till late 30s.  Haven't made it there yet, so I'll be patient.</div>

Maybe as a mage spirit isn't important for you but i can assure as a priest in the end game, having 150 spirit is crippling compared to the priest with 300. This is most likely due to spirit being perhaps the number 2, possibly number 1, stat for our class. It will take you twice as long, and that could be a matter of seconds or minutes, to regen your mana with 150 spirit over 300. In a place like MC, this could mean life or death for the raid as several healers in unison keeping up their mana is required. If one healer fails to make the cut, the others will have to pick up the slack but that can only be done so much before they too need to regen.

I am under the impression priests can spend their mana bar faster in these places than mages, though I haven't investigated it too closely. However, notice that if you use mage armor with arcane meditation as a mage, you get 45% of your mana regenerating while casting. While spirit was pretty crappy to a mage before, I think mage armor changes this substantially.</div>

I think it depends. Spam flash heal does eat mana quickly and most mages don't nuke a ton at once. But I was speaking more of regen time if you are using multiples priests in and out of casting, not active regen. Sadly priests have to invest a ton of talents to get a mere 15 % regen during all times.</div>

		<div>I've never had a problem with the quest identifiers on the mini-map.  There are occassional graphical glitches where the minimap doesn't refresh fast enough.  Perhaps that is what you are seeing.<br />
<br />
Personally, even though it is a pain, I say keep the griffons and don't allow daisy-chaining.  And no translocators.  One of the things that makes WoW special is the fact that the world feels big.  Griffons go a long way towards helping to acheive that.  I only wish boats were actual boat rides, with areas to explore in the middle of the ocean ala OOT.<br />
<br />
I would love to see in-game purchasable maps.  Actually what I really want to see is the ability to make your own custom maps in game and the ability to sell them at the auction house.<br />
<br />
Generally, I wouldn't say there are more stupid people in WoW as much as just that there are less people with experience at mmorpgs.  Probably one out of three have never played another mmorpg in their life.  This means their learning curve is different.<br />
<br />
AH.  Not much to say since you didn't get very specific.  It needs a better search function, and the interface is a bit wierd and redundant.<br />
<br />
The idea of providing monetary value for quest rewards is a good one.  I wish they would just make items you can't use droppable so you can sell them in the AH.<br />
<br />
I dont' have a problem with the graphics in WoW.  They remind me of the old days in EQ, in a very good way.<br />
<br />
The poor choice in models is somewhat tiresome.  But the variety in armor looks makes up for it to a great degree.<br />

From 46 to 60 I've carried this combination: <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=19595" target="_blank">Inventor's Focal Sword</a> and <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=19570" target="_blank">Cloud Stone</a>.<br />
Combined stats:<br />
Int: 16<br />
Sta: 0<br />
Spi: 10<br />
Arcane Resist: 10<br />
Spell Crits +1%.<br />
<br />
Mind that I got this at 48, off a single (lucky me) Maraudon run. What upgrades this in the 2h category? <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=5291" target="_blank">Trindlehaven Staff</a> off the boss of LBRS (5-manned at the bare minimum), <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=35933" target="_blank">Rod of the Ogre Magi</a> "off" the boss of Dire Maul (5-manned, and not particularly hard to get, but required 58 means it's not an upgrade to the inventor's for a long time), and <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=19726" target="_blank">Staff of Hale Magefire</a> apparently a world drop off 59+ mobs. And epic upgrade would be <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=5621" target="_blank">Glowing Brightwood Staff</a>, but good luck (granted, it's 300-600 gold at the AH occasionally) on that. Of these the only ones I'd actually switch for would be the Rod of the Ogre Magi and Glowing Brightwood. <br />
<br />
Sword and offhand combinations are not useless, there are just less big numbers on 'em. Just about every other horde caster who's done SM a sufficient number of times and hasn't massively outleveled (not that I haven't seen 60s running around with these, /sigh) them is wielding a hypnotic blade and a prophetic cane. The "best" combination/stave varies often, and your own evaluation of stats counts for far more than the official "best." WoW lets you make a lot of choices gear wise, as in the talent system. While everyone's more or less the same in absoute power, the customisation of a character does show up in subtle differences and <i>will</i> result in different strengths and weaknesses. Specialise your character in a manner that conforms to your playstyle, not the other way around, and most of the gear headaches go away.</div>

</div> /shrug, half the men I know who play are shims.  :evil: <br />

I have a staff, a dagger and orb, and a sword and orb combo which I switch between. As a warlock I melee a lot anyway, but all the combos have virtues. I'm not much of a min-maxer though. I got our weaponsmith to make me a sword (name escapes me) with no caster stats (great dps and proc) because it sheaths like a twohander and is as big as me.</div>
