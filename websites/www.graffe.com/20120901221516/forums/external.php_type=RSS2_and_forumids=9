Then her asked me why he couldn't print from his laptop, unless he was physically plugged into the router / not on wireless.<br />

I shrugged and told him to pray on it.</div>

Got an automated email with some engrish.. and I'm all like.. &quot;Huh.. that's weird&quot;. Decided to google them. Jeebus.  Third party forwarder to Japan with a ship to address in Carson CA. They have a tendency to file claims on damage that occurs in international transit.. O.o and Paypal/Ebay always sides with them!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I understand that obesity and weight loss are difficult obstacles in some individuals lives; I've never been overweight, so I dont know first hand. But my roommate is one of those unfortunate people who struggles with this. After steadily gaining weight he's over 400lbs now. And thats fine if that's what he wants to do and is happy like that, but obviously he's not and is <i>very</i> vocal about it, which is also fine. What is NOT fine, turning around and blaming everyone but yourself for your problems! He goes on a diet, loses some weight, then falls off the wagon, gains weight, then goes on yet another diet. Fine, whatever you want to do, but when I confront you about it (because you're so vocal and want support an encouragement) and then you backlash thats when we have a problem. Its fine if you want to blame your &quot;food addiction&quot; and no one will ever understand what that's like and why it's so hard to cope with. Or that it's normal to you to have some good weeks and bad weeks. One soda wont &quot;kill you&quot;, one pastry wont &quot;hurt&quot;. THATS FINE IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE THAT. But dont start lecturing me about the perils of food addiction when I say &quot;are you okay; it looks like you're gaining some weight&quot;, or when I suggest you not to get a donut. We especially have problems when you tell me every negative comment is like putting another 2lbs on you or forcing a cake down your throat. <i>You</i> are doing that! Dont use me as a scapegoat because you cant stop eating cake! <br />
I am not a stranger to having to change my diet and lifestyle. After being diagnosed with Crohns disease I had to stop eating gluten, grain, lactose, and sugar. It was hard, but it was something that I just HAD to do! And I did it. I loved pizza, chips, subway, panda express, burritos, muffins, toast, and all that stuff, but I had to give it up cold turkey and thats what I did. So dont come to me about how hard it is to stop a fucking cake from entering your mouth! I used to give fat people the benefit of the doubt because I thought it would be soo hard for me to give up the food I love (Subway and Panda especially!). I couldnt imagine it. I am telling you right now, IT. WAS. NOT. THAT. DIFFICULT. I knew what I could and couldnt eat, so guess what? I DIDNT EAT IT. Simple. When push comes to shove you just have to accept your situation and do what you need to do. So that is why fat people irk me to no end with their excuses. Because, in reality, its not that hard. Its depressing to give up whatever &quot;pick me up&quot; food you once had, but seriously its a piece of food, learn to live without it! Start counting your blessings and not your problems!</div>
