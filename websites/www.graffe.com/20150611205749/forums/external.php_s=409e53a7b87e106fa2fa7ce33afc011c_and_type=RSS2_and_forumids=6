			Dan Simmons' classic sci-fi novel Hyperion is being adapted at last -- as an event series for Syfy.<br />
<br />
The cable network (which, full disclosure, is Blastr's corporate parent) announced this morning that it will team with producer/actor Bradley Cooper (American Sniper), Oscar-winning producer Graham King (Argo) and director/producer Todd Phillips (The Hangover) to bring the massive novel -- the first in a tetralogy -- to the screen.<br />
<br />
Cooper, King and Phillips will executive-produce the series, which is being penned by Boardwalk Empire writer Itamar Moses.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I have to admit, these books are on my Kindle and I've only heard fantastic things about them, but haven't gotten to read them yet.  Some big names attached on the writing/producing side... hope they can do a good job with it.</div>

<br />
I had a similar problem with a Galaxy S4 last year and there was apparently an antenna issue which prompted a replacement program, but the problem still persisted after that replacement.  Last fall, I upgraded to the S5 after being assured that the problem was fixed now.  It's not.<br />

How do I figure out what is causing the problem?</div>

<br />
<br />
This movie wasn't as good as people hyped.  I'd give it like a C+ for being a 'deep' sci-fi thriller. Predestination seemed pretty cliched, but almost anyone interested in sci-fi or time travel has either read the short story it was based on, or is familiar with a derivative. Here are some non-spoiler reasons I didn't like Ex Machina:<br />
<br />
1) All of the characters involved are kind of terrible people.  But the film doesn't really explore a single fucking one of them.<br />
2) The character motivations for every character is a bit pointless<br />
3) Everything you get out of this film is something you bring into it.  At core moments of the film where you would be able to determine each character's motivations, or apparent motivations, it cuts away and moves you to another part of the story.<br />
4) Towards the unsatisfying, and completely broadcast finale, they attempt to distract you with full frontal nudity.  I dislike when entertainment resorts to using tits to distract me from it's low entertainment value.  I call it the Hooters Effect.  &quot;Our food is shit, so how do we get people to keep coming in?&quot;<br />
5) This film feels like a case of the Emperor's New Clothes.  It tries extremely hard to be avant-garde, and it asks an interesting question, but that means everything good that comes from this film happens in your mind.<br />
<br />
Simplifying a bit, the core part of the early story revolves around a series of interviews. The entire explained objective of this part of the story is that he's here to do these interviews.  Each interview apparently takes him only a few minutes, at which point there is a recap where some other characters discuss the interview, and then it jumps ahead to the next day.  There is little to no character development, and you're basically supposed to assume each character is glued into their archetype mold.<br />
<br />
There's a lonely nerdy guy, an egotistical pathological liar 0.01%er, and the interviewee appears to be a damsel in distress archetype. All of them are re-enacting the opening scene of Blade Runner over 108 minutes.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>more</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
Kind of going with another list, but it's mostly barely organized thoughts.<br />
1) If someone tells you they want you to find out the capabilities of an AI, you should probably spend more than a few minutes conducting the interview.<br />
2) If you suspect someone has a fucking camera on you, and seems kind of insane, wouldn't you want to provide yourself a weapon?<br />
3) While reprogramming the entire security system, maybe you should take the extra step to make a fucking COPY of the master keycard?<br />
4) What kind of loser falls in love with someone in a weeks worth of 10 minute conversations?  Yeah yeah, she was modeled on his porn habits.<br />
4a) We're supposed to talk the films word for it that Caleb loves Ava. What fucking bullshit.  There is no connection shown.<br />
5) The one point of the story where I started to get super interesting is when he started to panic that he was a robot.<br />
6) If I could somehow go back in time and take the actors and director from this movie, and have them make The Machine instead, that film would have deserved the hype.<br />
7) This movie would have made a better episode of Black Mirror.<br />
8) Everyone that seems to love this movie seems to have fallen for the premise that Caleb loves Ava.<br />
9) If you assume that an AI can already pass a turing test, the next step is empathy. Ava never demonstrates she is anything except a sociopath, and I'm sure as fuck not going to intentionally end up in a situation where I hope a Sociopath helps me.<br />
<br />
Also, I said above that the characters fit their archetypes. I'm really saying that the film only works if you believe they fit their archetypes.  They don't fit their archetypes, because Caleb is pretty fucking dumb for basically being the smartest person in the entirety of Facebook+Google.  His grasp of emotional responses is a bit too strong for someone who would be able to handle the stresses of that job with the personality required.  Nathan on the other hand is relatively honest. All he wants to do is hang out, drink booze, and work on his inventions.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I was following the film, and on-board with whatever was happening until the final day.  The dialog was smart, the way scenes were shot was well done, there was just a flimsy plot. The third act of the film was non-existent, and relies on the viewer buying too much, especially when one of the 3 characters in the movie has already explained why that belief is wrong. You have to be completely immersed and completely buy the archetypes for this film to work. The second you analyze any of the characters and decide the archetype for them is wrong, the entire film falls apart during the third act.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This popped up last week on my Instant View list, so I decided to give it a shot.  I'm only 5 episodes in but I like it a lot and will continue to watch.<br />
<br />
Basic premise:  Eight people across the world are connected mentally, sharing knowledge and sensations and experiences.<br />
<br />
Stars include Brian Smith (SGU), Freema Agyeman (Doctor Who), but mostly people you might recognize in bit parts from things here and there.<br />
<br />
Being Netflix there's some nudity, lots of F-bombs, but it's a good watch.  Definitely fills the void while SHIELD and Daredevil are between seasons :)<br />
<br />
My only &quot;complaint&quot; would be that Freema does a horrible American accent :\</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I know there are a lot of baseball experts here... got a question.<br />
<br />
Here's the situation:  pitcher throws a breaking ball/changeup, and it skips on the ground in front of the plate, but the catcher fields it cleanly.  The batter is fooled on the pitch and swings at it for the 3rd strike.  The umpire allows the runner to try to advance to first on a dropped 3rd strike, even though the ball was fielded cleanly by the catcher.<br />
<br />
I've seen this called in a couple of High School games and last night it happened to my son's Babe Ruth team that I'm coaching.<br />
<br />
Is this the correct ruling?  Is it a dropped 3rd strike just because it hits the ground, regardless of how the catcher fields it?  Or was the umpire wrong?</div>

<br />
I applied for a couple IT positions at the VA - they were &quot;referred to the selecting official&quot;. No word for a bit, call today to check the status and find out the selecting officials are supposed to make selections this week. I assumed since I wasn't called for an interview that I wouldn't be getting it, but according to the HR person I spoke to the selcting official can offer based on your resume and other documentation submitted. <br />
<br />
This sounds odd, and completely different than my experience - anyone else had a similar experience?</div>

			British airlines 'face multiple toxic air claims'<br />
<br />
By Jim Reed <br />
Reporter, Victoria Derbyshire programme<br />
<br />
<br />
8 June 2015<br />
<br />
 From the section Business<br />
 Seventeen former and serving cabin crew are planning legal action against British airlines saying they have been poisoned by contaminated cabin air. <br />
<br />
The cases are funded by the Unite union which represents 20,000 flight staff. <br />
<br />
Workers believe they have fallen sick after breathing in fumes mixed with engine oil and other toxic chemicals.<br />
<br />
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says incidents of smoke or fumes on planes are rare and there is no evidence of long-term health effects.<br />
<br />
Oxygen masks<br />
<br />
The Unite union, which is calling for a public inquiry into contaminated cabin air, has recently opened a dedicated legal unit to record and process claims from its membership. <br />
<br />
<br />
Its lawyers are now working on 17 &quot;definite&quot; individual personal injury claims against British airlines in the civil courts, although these are still at an early stage.<br />
<br />
Uncensored safety reports submitted to the CAA, and obtained by the Victoria Derbyshire programme, show that between April 2014 and May 2015 there were 251 separate incidents of fumes or smoke inside a large passenger jet operated by a British airline.<br />
<br />
The BBC has, where possible, chosen not to include cases which could be blamed on an internal fault like a broken toilet or air conditioning system. <br />
<br />
The statistics do not include international airlines, such as Lufthansa and Ryanair, even when travelling in British airspace.<br />
<br />
An illness was reported in 104 of the 251 cases, and on at least 28 of those flights oxygen was administered.<br />
<br />
The programme has also seen first-hand testimony from a pilot working for a major UK airline who believes he was affected by toxic fumes while landing at Birmingham Airport in 2014.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost instantly myself and the captain became very unwell and decided it was bad enough to place our oxygen masks on,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn't declare a mayday - mostly due to not being able to think of the words needed to say - and ended up auto-landing the plane and simply briefing, 'Whoever is alive or conscious, pull back the thrust levels after touchdown.' It was that serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Around half the air on board most modern commercial jets is drawn through the engines. <br />
<br />
Campaigners say when a fault occurs in the engine seals, a cocktail of potentially poisonous gases can reach the cabin. This includes TCP, an organophosphate known to be dangerous to human health in high enough quantities. <br />
<br />
It is repeated exposure to such fume events - combined with long-term, low-level exposure to chemicals - which some cabin crew believe has damaged their long-term health.<br />
<br />
The problems are said to affect the central nervous system and brain.<br />
<br />
The CAA says there is no evidence that chemicals appear at high enough concentrations to cause harm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lawyers and campaigners are closely watching a series of inquests which could influence the outcome of a much larger number of civil cases.<br />
<br />
Pilot Richard Westgate died in December 2012, aged 43, after complaining of long-term health problems. <br />
<br />
<b>Last February, the coroner in the inquest into his death wrote to British Airways and the CAA saying that examinations of Mr Westgate's body &quot;disclosed symptoms consistent with exposure to organophosphate compounds in aircraft cabin air&quot;.</b><br />
<br />
Airplane cockpit<br />
He asked them to take &quot;urgent action to prevent future deaths&quot;. <br />
<br />
Both organisations have since replied to the coroner implying he overstepped the mark and had relied on &quot;selective and contentious evidence&quot;. <br />
<br />
<b>A second inquest is due to open into the case of 34-year-old Matthew Bass who died suddenly in January 2014 after suffering unexplained health problems. <br />
<br />
His family says a specialist post-mortem examination found high levels of toxins in his nervous system linked to organophosphates.</b><br />
<br />
British Airways said in a statement: &quot;We would not operate an aircraft if we believed it posed a health or safety risk to our customers or crew.<br />
<br />
&quot;There has been substantial research into questions around cabin air quality over the last few years. In summary, the research has found no evidence that exposure to potential chemicals in the cabin causes long-term ill health&quot;. <br />
<br />
Airbus and Boeing both maintain cabin air is safe to breathe.<br />
<br />
'Nocebo effect'<br />
<br />
In 2013, an independent group of scientists, the Committee on Toxicity, looked at the evidence of long-term health effects for the government. <br />
<br />
It could not establish a link between contaminated cabin air and ill health. <br />
<br />
&quot;The levels [of harmful chemicals in planes] were as low or even lower than those in the home or the workplace,&quot; said Prof Alan Boobis, current chairman of the committee.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't be sure what the levels are in fume events, which are very rare, but we do have some information which would indicate that even in those circumstances levels are probably below those which would affect health in humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
The committee believes one explanation could be the so-called &quot;nocebo&quot; effect, a psychological condition where exposure to a harmless substance can lead to nausea, fatigue and other medical symptoms.<br />
<br />
line<br />
Recorded incidents<br />
<br />
The following table shows extracts of some of the most critical safety reports submitted by crew to the CAA.<br />
<br />
<br />
Date Airplane Title Details <br />
12/08/2014 Boeing 767-300 Mayday declared and aircraft returned due to acrid fumes on flight deck. Decision taken to return to departure airport. Fireman on entry stated acrid smell was obvious and strong. Captain made a PA informing customers we would be returning to departure airport due to a technical problem, but he didn't want to give them too much information on the incident... Heathrow. <br />
<br />
13/08/2014 Airbus A320 Fumes in the flight deck caused flight crew illness. Two crew members donned portable oxygen as a safety precaution. Cabin crew members suffered stinging eyes, burning on the inside of the nose and a strong metallic taste in the mouth. Crew members attended hospital for the effects of the fumes. <br />
<br />
02/11/2014 Boeing 777-200 Fumes in passenger cabin during cruise. Strong smell of gas in cabin around door area. Had previously felt sick whilst in bunk rest. I got severe headache and pain in sinus. Earlier two other flight crew had both felt nauseous and another had bad headache. <br />
<br />
29/02/2015 Boeing 747 Fumes in cabin. Eleven of the cabin crew became unwell during the flight with symptoms of light headedness, nausea and sea sickness. Oxygen administered.  During the cruise, SCCM ['Senior Cabin Crew Member] informed the Captain that a number of cabin crew were feeling unwell... One cabin crew member subsequently collapsed and was administered first aid and oxygen... A general view of incapacitation during flight for all operating crew members needs to be undertaken to ensure the existing processes remain relevant. <br />
<br />
19/04/2015 Airbus A321 Flight crew and cabin crew illness due to fumes in the flight deck and cabin. On return sector, fumes entered flight deck from unknown origin. Both crew suffered to some degree with headaches, stinging eyes, and debilitation. One crew member remained on portable O2, which helped massively. <br />

			A man whose Greenwood Village home was destroyed by police in a barricade situation is angry, claiming police used excessive force to get the job done.<br />
<br />
&quot;My house has been destroyed by a paramilitary unit,&quot; owner Leo Lech said Friday. &quot;We'll have to basically doze it down to the foundation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The home, at 4219 S. Alton St., has been condemned, Lech said.<br />
<br />
Lech also fears that he'll be left alone to deal with the damage and aftermath.<br />
<br />
His nightmare began Wednesday when Lech's 25-year-old son, who lives in the home and rents from his father, called and told him police had cordoned off the property and he couldn't get in.<br />
<br />
On Thursday morning, his son called back.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said: 'The house is totaled!' &quot; Lech recalled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought, they broke down the door, or fired tear gas through a window,&quot; Lech said. &quot;When he showed me the pictures, I was just aghast  unbelievable!

</div>Seriously wtf,  They blew up someone's house for a shoplifter?   One would think in this case they would have to ask permission to total a structure over one suspect... And the cops claim they are not responsible yet the SWAT team had to decide &quot;Hey guys I bet it would be really awesome to rip this place apart.&quot;</div>

			All video games are stupid, of course. That whole thing of, 'you're not really shooting terrorists or winning the World Cup, you're just pressing buttons' is patronizing and simplistic but every now and again you come across a game that has so little emotional connection to who you are that you end up standing there, gazing at the screen and saying &quot;I'm just pressing buttons and my life has no meaning,&quot; to a slightly bemused PR person.<br />
<br />
Music games are often about pressing buttons according to visual cues, which is probably why the whole genre collapsed a few years ago. That and the ferocious greed of Activision, which insisted on publishing way too many of these games.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As everyone knows, exercising blows a squadron of dicks over time. It feels good, you know you should do it, but the only way to make it is through brutal habit to wit, it becomes boring as hell and people rightfully abandon it in favor of dying early in life.<br />
<br />
However, in one of my most brilliant ideas of all-time it occurs to me that I can combine sex and masturbation in place of a cardio routine and perhaps even a weight lifting routine with body weights perhaps.<br />
<br />
This seems like a tremendously brilliant and obvious thing to do at the time however I am completely unable to locate any useful information on routines etc. or even analysis on various positions' effectiveness. <br />
<br />
So, does anyone have any reference material on this subject. I feel like this is an opportunity to export the revolution and get America fit but I cannot find shit related to this that is not incredibly unspecific.<br />
<br />
I also wish I could find some sex toys that were very amenable to having additional weight added to them for upper body workouts type exercise. Despite the sex industry's tremendously fast iteration and tremendous coverage of usages, this seems like a completely missed out category that could transform the first world and make Wal-Mart a better place to visit.<br />
<br />
Also, I think it would be nice for a product to advertise itself as &quot;Fuck Your Way to Better Health&quot; in true American fuck yeah fashion.<br />
<br />
Clothing for weight training that I had in mind were things like this: <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/ZFOsports®-40LBS-ADJUSTABLE-WEIGHTED-VEST/dp/B002P60ZZC/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/ZFOsports®-40L...dp/B002P60ZZC/</a><br />
<br />
Obviously the main goal here though is to finally realize a childhood dream to train like Goku.<br />

			Nuclear weapons tests: Ministry of Defence admits it irradiated civilians in the Cold War<br />
<br />
3:35, 23 May 2015  <br />
By Susie Boniface <br />
  <br />
<br />
Thousands of non-military staff suffered effects of the blasts and later had their health studied by government, with increased risk of cancer and heart disease<br />
<br />
The Ministry of Defence has admitted *thousands of civilian staff were irradiated in nuclear weapons tests during the Cold War.<br />
<br />
But is still denies that veterans of the nuclear tests, which began in 1952 when Britain exploded its first device, were harmed.<br />
<br />
A newly uncovered government study details the death and cancer rates of 174,541 people who were exposed to radiation at nuclear facilities.<br />
<br />
Of those, 64,909 were employed by the MoD in non-military roles such as maintaining nuclear submarines and weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is more than three times as many people as were affected by Britains nuclear bomb tests on Christmas Island in the 1950s  veterans who are also subject to government studies, and have had their NHS records flagged by the MoD.<br />
<br />
The study of civilians shows higher doses increased the risk of thyroid, lung and rectal cancers, leukaemia and heart disease.<br />
<br />
<b> <i>Yet while test veterans suffer the same cancers and have fathered children with 10 times the normal rate of birth defects, the Government spent millions fighting negligence claims</i> </b>.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 2009 study was found by Steve Clifford, 52, of Fleckney, Leics, as he searched for evidence that his dad Graham, 76, was *irradiated while serving as a cook on Christmas Island during 1957 bomb tests.<br />
<br />
Steve, who survived an adult form of leukaemia when he was four and now has chronic pain with bony growths on his shoulders, said: Whats truly eye-popping is their logic that *civilians can be irradiated and get cancer but radiation just bounces off the armed forces without doing any damage.<br />
<br />
The obscure study he discovered was carried out by government statisticians in 2009.<br />
<br />
It details 174,541 people who recorded a radiation dose at a number of organisations with nuclear facilities  power stations, scientific institutions, and the Atomic Weapons Establishment.<br />
<br />
But by far the most  64,909, or 37 per cent  were employed by the MoD.<br />
<br />
They are thought to have been civilians supporting military work, such as operating and maintaining nuclear submarines and weapons, as well as a handful of military dentists and radiologists.<br />
<br />
The tests saw 22,000 troops, many on National Service, were ordered to watch dozens of atomic and hydrogen blasts, and live among the toxic fallout for up to a year afterwards.<br />
<br />
On their return they developed cancer and rare medical conditions, their wives had three times the normal rate of miscarriage and their children suffered deformities.<br />
<br />
The MoD said civilians with a recorded dose would be eligible for a compensation scheme.<br />
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>note I said while ago, the &quot;official safe doses etc&quot;  are a load of bollocks.<br />
This is why, as they can't have folk claiming compensation or the Public realizing how many cancer cases are linked to the fact we're STILL getting fallout from those insane above ground bomb tests!<br />
And lot of the &quot;official line&quot; for those was complete balls, be it the very first test (where fallout did spread across populated areas), to the first British bomb test (where they said the fallout wasn't that bad...BULLSHIT! was a re-do of USA's 5th bomb detonation and that was dirtier than hellfire)<br />
<br />
blech, can't find link, study showed fallout coming down from Stratosphere was 40% higher than expected.<br />
individually the risk is smaller, globally, the death toll cannot be anything other than enormous<br />
and I'll trust Sahkarov over the &quot;system&quot; on this!</div>
