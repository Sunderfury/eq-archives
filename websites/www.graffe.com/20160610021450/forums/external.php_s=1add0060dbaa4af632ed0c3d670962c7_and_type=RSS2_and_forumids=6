<br />
That's where police can seize your property and cash without first proving you committed a crime; without a warrant and without arresting you, as long as they suspect that your property is somehow tied to a crime.<br />
<br />
Now, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol has a device that also allows them to seize money in your bank account or on prepaid cards.<br />
<br />
It's called an ERAD, or Electronic Recovery and Access to Data machine, and state police began using 16 of them last month.<br />
<br />
Here's how it works. If a trooper suspects you may have money tied to some type of crime, the highway patrol can scan any cards you have and seize the money.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're gonna look for different factors in the way that you're acting,” Oklahoma Highway Patrol Lt. John Vincent said. “We're gonna look for if there's a difference in your story. If there's someway that we can prove that you're falsifying information to us about your business.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troopers insist this isn't just about seizing cash.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that a lot of people are just going to focus on the seizing money. That's a very small thing that' s happening now. The largest part that we have found ... the biggest benefit has been the identity theft,&quot; Vincent said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can prove can prove that you have a legitimate reason to have that money it will be given back to you. And we've done that in the past,&quot; Vincent said about any money seized.<br />
<br />
State Sen. Kyle Loveless, R-Oklahoma City, said that removes due process and the belief that a suspect is presumed innocent until proven guilty. He said we've already seen cases in Oklahoma where police are abusing the system.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've seen single mom's stuff be taken, a cancer survivor his drugs taken, we saw a Christian band being taken. We've seen innocent people's stuff being taken. We've seen where the money goes and how it's been misspent,&quot; Loveless said.<br />
<br />
Loveless plans to introduce legislation next session that would require a conviction before any assets could be seized.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I had to err on the side of one side versus the other, I would err on the side of the Constitution,” Loveless said. “And I think that's what we need to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
News 9 obtained a copy of the contract with the state.<br />
<br />
It shows the state is paying ERAD Group Inc., $5,000 for the software and scanners, then 7.7 percent of all the cash the highway patrol seizes.</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Out of the great body of hateful cuntery the US has produced in its short history, this one blows past surreal and enters hyperreality. So now a state which was already the country's dried cum stain on an elegant dress, says we are not happy being fuck flotsam, we also need to be recognized by every demographic as such.<br />
<br />
And it would be one thing to pursue being the sum of all terrible oral sex, but they then communicate that in the most dumbfuck way possible ignoring how much in lawyer fees and time that commandeering the guilty until proven innocent assets will be.<br />
<br />
So now everyone has to drive around the sexless incompetent dicksuck further inconveniencing humanity with its shitfuck humanbeings and their abortive thought processes. <br />
<br />
But we share some of the fuck up here, someone had to teach these cow jism cumgurdlers to read and write.</div>

The arguments that absent any constraints from bureaucracy present elsewhere comics acted as a means for communicating social reform were well laid out.<br />
<br />
It's interesting in another way how it is another instance of the perception of rules and conventions being necessary and imposed upon a group inorganically ultimately subtracts away some to all of the value the group created before gatekeepers felt compelled to wet their own beak, something that is continually repeated elsewhere in organizations.<br />
<br />
While I haven't read any erotic comics, the interviews with the domain masters were interesting, how diverse their styles and motivations were, their perceptions of their own works etc.<br />

The entire documentary is about an hour long.</div>

			Public outrage over the lenient sentencing of a star Stanford swimmer convicted of sexual assault has been compounded by a controversial letter written by the athlete’s father.<br />
<br />
Brock Turner was convicted in March of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman at a fraternity party in January 2015 at the elite university. He faced up to 14 years in prison. Prosecutors asked for six.<br />
<br />
<b>Instead, Turner received only six months in jail and three years of probation after a judge worried that a stiffer sentence would have a “severe impact” on the 20-year-old.</b><br />
<br />
The light sentence drew harsh criticism from prosecutors and advocates and prompted widespread fury on social media.<br />
<br />
That fury intensified Sunday as critics slammed a letter written by Turner’s father as oblivious, “tone-deaf” and “impossibly offensive.”<br />
<br />
“His life will never be the one that he dreamed about and worked so hard to achieve,” Dan A. Turner wrote in a letter arguing that his son should receive probation, not jail time. “That is a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action out of his 20 plus years of life.”<br />
<br />
“He will never be his happy go lucky self with that easy going personality and welcoming smile,” the letter says, noting that the former Olympic hopeful is now a registered sex offender.<br />
<br />
In an interview with The Washington Post early Monday morning, Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen confirmed that the letter had been submitted to the court before Turner’s sentencing last week and criticized the letter for reducing a brutal sexual assault to “20 minutes of action.” He also slammed Turner and his father for refusing to own up to the crime.<br />
<br />
“To this day, the defendant denies what he did,” Rosen said, adding that Turner “preyed upon” his victim and displayed violence.<br />
<br />
Brock Turner’s attorney did not return The Post’s request for comment regarding Dan Turner’s letter.<br />
<br />
The controversial letter emerged three days after prosecutors released another letter, this one written by the victim, who has not been named.<br />
<br />
The two letters stand in stark contrast. While Dan Turner’s has been described as myopic, the victim’s has been called powerful and moving.<br />
<br />
The victim’s letter begins by bluntly addressing her attacker.<br />
<br />
“You don’t know me, but you’ve been inside me, and that’s why we’re here today,” she read in court. She then described how she decided to attend a party so she could spend time with her younger sister.<br />
<br />
“I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college,” she said. “The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing.”<br />
<br />
She described in painful detail how the hospital staff documented her assault with probes and swabs, “shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. …<br />
<br />
“I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.”<br />
<br />
She described Turner as a predator picking off “the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself. …”<br />
<br />
She added: “Sometimes I think, if I hadn’t gone, then this never would’ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue.”<br />
<br />
“You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore,” she said of his conviction. “You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things.”<br />
<br />
And yet, that is essentially the tone of Turner’s father’s letter.<br />
<br />
Dan Turner’s letter begins with brisk reference to the sexual assault.<br />
<br />
“First of all, let me say that Brock is absolutely devastated by the events of January 17th and 18th 2015,” it says. “He would do anything to turn back the hands of time and have that night to do over again. In many one-on-one conversations with Brock since that day, I can tell you that he is truly sorry for what occurred that night and for all the pain and suffering that it has caused for all those involved and impacted by that night. He has expressed true remorse for his actions on that night.”<br />
<br />
Rosen said, however, that Brock Turner never accepted responsibility for the assault. Had he done so, prosecutors probably would have agreed to a sentence of less than six years.<br />
<br />
Dan Turner’s letter then launches into a description of his son’s “easygoing personality” and the “inner strength” that made him such a good swimmer.<br />
<br />
Dan Turner said he and his son were “totally in awe” of Stanford’s campus, and noted with pride the school’s 4 percent acceptance rate.<br />
<br />
Turner then described his son not as a sexual predator, but as a victim.<br />
<br />
“He excelled in school that quarter earning the top GPA for all freshmen on the swim team,” the father wrote in his letter. “What we didn’t realize was the extent to which Brock was struggling being so far from home. … When Brock was home during the Christmas break, he broke down and told us how much he was struggling to fit in socially.<br />
<br />
“In hindsight, it’s clear that Brock was desperately trying to fit in at Stanford and fell into the culture of alcohol consumption and partying,” Dan Turner concluded. “This culture was modeled by many of the upperclassmen on the swim team and played a role in the events of Jan 17th and 18th 2015.”<br />
<br />
During the trial, prosecutors had argued that Brock Turner was part of a bigger problem.<br />
<br />
“He may not look like a rapist, but he is the … face of campus sexual assault,” Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci told the jury, according to the San Jose Mercury News.<br />
<br />
In his letter to the judge, however, Dan Turner appeared to be flipping this script, using the pervasiveness of the problem as a shield to hide his son’s personal responsibility.<br />
<br />
The Internet was not having it.<br />
<br />
Prompting particular social media outrage was the way Dan Turner portrayed his son’s suffering.<br />
<br />
“His every waking minute is consumed with worry, anxiety, fear, and depression,” the father wrote. “You can see this in his face, the way he walks, his weakened voice, his lack of appetite. Brock always enjoyed certain types of food and is a very good cook himself. I was always excited to buy him a big ribeye steak to grill or to get his favorite steak for him. … Now he barely consumes any food and eats only to exist.”<br />
<br />
Others also focused on the almost flippant reference to “20 minutes of action.”<br />
<br />
The letter, which was first published by liberal website ThinkProgess, makes no explicit reference to Brock Turner’s victim, meanwhile.<br />
<br />
Despite what critics called its tone-deafness, however, the letter apparently worked.<br />
<br />
Judge Aaron Persky agreed with probation officials’ recommendation that Turner receive only six months in jail.<br />
<br />
“A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him. … I think he will not be a danger to others,” the judge said, citing Turner’s youth and lack of criminal record, the Guardian reported.<br />
<br />
That ruling has also made Persky a target of public ire. In the days since his decision, a Change.org petition calling for his removal has gathered almost 12,000 signatures. The petition also called for someone to challenge Persky in an upcoming election, in which he is currently unopposed.<br />
<br />
Rosen said he was disappointed that Persky did not sentence Turner to more time.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the prosecutor said he saw a silver lining in how the case and Turner’s lenient sentence had “led to a frank discussion about how to prevent campus sexual assault and what those campuses should do when it happens.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, what has helped to create such national attention in this case is the eloquence of the victim,” he added. “Never in my 20 years as a prosecutor have I seen a more eloquent victim statement.”<br />
<br />
Rosen said her letter had done more than just tell her tale. It had “come to represent the truth of thousands of sexual assault victims have experienced as well.”<br />
<br />
Indeed, her letter slammed Brock Turner for his solipsism.<br />
<br />
“You said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life,” she wrote.<br />
<br />
“Ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. …<br />
<br />
“You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.”

<br />
I was never a huge boxing fan, but I can watch Muhammad Ali fights one after another for an indefinite amount of time.<br />
<br />
(The only other boxing match I enjoy re-watching is Tyson vs. Buster Douglas.)<br />
<br />
I must have about six different DVD's about Ali's life and times.  I think one just focuses on the &quot;Rumble in the Jungle.&quot;  Another focuses on all his early fights before the ban.  -Several complete lifetime compilations and the one with Will Smith.  I'll be watching them all again today I think.<br />
<br />
No one will ever convince me there was ever a greater boxer than Muhammad Ali.<br />
<br />
His victory over Foreman in Zaire, at his age at the time, was the epitome of EPIC.  There is nothing more epic than that victory.<br />
<br />
And if you watch his early fights before the ban, holy fuck there was never anything like him.  Lightning fast, truly, and powerful.  Many of those fights show him literally TOYING with his opponents.  -Dancing around, dodging every punch, doing big wind-ups before his punches, etc.  He was in a league of his own.<br />
<br />
A very sorrowful loss for our generation.<br />

<br />
This is a really good article about the coming of the self-driving &quot;robot&quot; car and built in ethics.  I really like the part about Vision Zero and their belief:  <i>No amount of mobility or economic efficiency is worth a single human life</i>.  As hard as it is to imagine no automobile deaths, it is definitely a worthy goal to pursue.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with the whole idea about how do you code into a self-driving car who to kill when it determines an accident it imminent.  I think the below quote from the article is a bit of an exaggeration, but still valid.<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			In the “The Tunnel Problem,” Millar’s driverless car (let’s call her Porsche again) is fast approaching a narrow tunnel, the entrance of which is blocked by a child who has fallen in the roadway. The car can either kill the kid or hit the wall of the tunnel, killing the driver (who is really just a passenger).Millar insists programmers need to build such scenarios into their code. I imagine them writing something like this:<br />
if (kid_in_tunnel &gt; 16) {<br />
  kill kid_in_tunnel;<br />
lp “We are sorry for your loss.”;<br />
}<br />
 else {<br />
  kill ass_in_Porsche;<br />
lp “Serves you right, schmucko.”;<br />
}<br />
Millar wants programmers to ask, “How should the car react?” But again, there’s a better question: “Why was the car going so damn fast in the first place?”
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I for one am really torn on the whole coming of the robot car.  On the one hand I would love an autopilot when I have to drive a long way on a boring interstate highway (although with audio books even that is no longer as bad as it use to be), but on the other hand (and I know you will be able to disengage autopilot mode) I love to drive on challenging, fun roads.  Driving is like a lot of other things in life, at times it's a chore, but often it can be freeing and fun.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So yes, I have reached the point where I need to ask for help, from anyone, anywhere. I haven't even gone to family yet. I've been mostly a lurker here for the past 13 years, but I respect a number of you and know there is a lot of wisdom to be had from some of our posters. I don't care about humiliation or embarrassment anymore. And maybe writing this down, making it more than words spoken, will help, even if no one replies. This will be long, so if you're still reading bear with me.<br />
<br />
I have been married to a woman for over 16 years now. We met online in 1997 - I lived in New York, she in California. My brother lived in San Diego and my job was national, so after a year of &quot;online dating&quot; I decided to uproot my entire life and give it a try - I moved to San Diego to live with my brother while we dated in the &quot;real world.&quot; 6 months later she and I moved in together, and 18 months after that we were married. She had two children from a previous marriage, they were 5 and 4 when I moved in.<br />
<br />
For the most part, we are awesome together. I grew to love her kids and they called me dad. I watched them grow up, and they are now both college students living at home. I've always felt that my wife is my soul mate. But now, I just don't know.<br />
<br />
About 5 years ago, sex began tapering off. I mentioned it once or twice and things sort of got back on track. Full disclosure: We have money problems. We have a massive amount of debt. We both have awesome jobs and can pay our bills, but the debt is like a second mortgage each month. So there is stress, oh yes. Eventually it had been 5 months since we made love.<br />
<br />
Move forward to November of 2014. I confronted her about the sex - she said she simply felt no desire at all, for anyone. I assumed it was stress from bills, stress from her job, anything. I point blank asked her if it was me. She swears she is happy with me. She made me feel a little bad about it, like ALL I wanted was sex from her. I think that was a bit unfair after 5 months of being patient.<br />
<br />
I am a highly sexual person, and believe intimacy is crucial in marriage. I am perfectly happy with my wife in all other respects. So I decided to see what would happen if I tried to &quot;tough it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, you can probably guess what happened. Lots of no sex. Yesterday (yes, 18 months of no sex) I realized nothing would change if I continued to suffer in silence. I tried to talk to her. I told her how important physical intimacy is to me, and hell to ANY healthy marriage. She said its not me, but that she &quot;doesn't miss sex.&quot; I asked her if we could compromise. She said and I quote &quot;how? Do you want to rape your wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know what to do. In every respect except the physical, this woman is my soul mate. But she seems perfectly happy to be in a &quot;platonic marriage.&quot; I don't want a roommate. I want a wife. She even asked if I was divorcing her. I told her I didn't want to leave her over this. I asked her is she still loves me, and she swears she does. But could someone who actually loves me be this unwilling to do something about my unhappiness? Am I being unreasonable? <br />
<br />
I tried to see if all the other things in our relationship are the problem, but she closed down after I confronted her yesterday. We barely spoke two words after our talk in the early AM.<br />
<br />
I am shattered. I feel like a failure as a man and a husband. I've come to love her children as mine. Granted, they are adults now, but I still feel the same. I am tired of being unhappy. I wish I knew what to do.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for listening if you're still here fellow Graffites. I guess its a sign of how hurt and desperate I am that I am really going to hit the button to post this. I think its time to call some family and see if anyone can help.</div>

Mental health champion for UK schools axed after criticising government <br />
<br />
 <br />
Department for Education denies axing of role is connected to Natasha Devon’s criticism of policies such as increased testing<br />
<br />
<br />
Sally Weale Education correspondent<br />
<br />
Wednesday 4 May 2016 19.04 BST  Last modified on Saturday 7 May 2016 14.57 BST  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The government has dropped its mental health champion for schools after she publicly criticised current education policies, in particular the testing regime, which she claims is detrimental to children’s mental health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Natasha Devon was appointed by the government last August to raise awareness of and reduce the stigma surrounding young people’s mental health, as part of a wider £1.25bn drive to improve care.<br />
<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, however, it emerged that the high-profile role had been axed, raising concerns that the government was attempting to silence her.<br />
<br />
The Department for Education denied this, saying Devon would remain on their mental health steering group, which would be making recommendations in the summer.<br />
<br />
Supporters said they were not surprised she had been let go as she had become “a thorn in the flesh” of the DfE after speaking out against government policies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last week, at a conference of headteachers in London, she highlighted the academic pressures facing young people, saying she knew her opinions would not be popular in some circles, but felt she had to be brave and speak out.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Time and time again over recent years young people – and the people who teach them – have spoken out about how a rigorous culture of testing and academic pressure is detrimental to their mental health,” she said.<br />
<br />
<br />
  <br />
“At one end of the scale we’ve got four-year-olds being tested, at the other end of the scale we’ve got teenagers leaving school and facing the prospect of leaving university with record amounts of debt. Anxiety is the fastest growing illness in under 21s. These things are not a coincidence.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The DfE denied that the axing of the role was connected to Devon’s criticism of government policy, or that she was being silenced, but said it was because a new cross-government mental health champion was being appointed, which made Devon’s role obsolete.<br />
<br />
Luciana Berger, mental health shadow minister, said Devon had spoken out “openly and honestly about the challenges facing children’s mental health under this Tory government.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“If she has been silenced then this raises serious questions over the government’s commitment to listening to the evidence and acting in the best interests of young people’s mental health and wellbeing.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Ministers must explain themselves as a matter of urgency. Nicky Morgan [the education secretary] claims to be in ‘listening mode’ but it would appear that this does not extend to those that do not agree with her.”<br />
<br />
A DfE spokesperson said Devon had done “a great job of helping us to raise the profile of young people’s mental health since her appointment last year.<br />
<br />
“Since that time, the independent NHS taskforce report has been published, which recommended that a cross-government mental health champion be created – for this reason we have had to reconsider the department’s own role.<br />
<br />
“We have asked Natasha and others who have been involved in our work to empower schools and young people to promote good mental health to continue to work with us as we prepare to launch our activity later this year.”<br />
<br />
The spokesperson added: “Natasha will remain a full member of the DfE’s mental health steering group, which will be making recommendations this summer. Natasha will stay closely involved with all our work.”<br />
<br />
Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity YoungMinds, said: “We are very surprised and sad that Natasha’s role as mental health champion has ended. She’s done a superb job of drawing attention to the crucial importance of mental health and wellbeing in schools.”<br />
<br />
News of Devon’s departure came the day after hundreds of parents chose to keep their children at home on Tuesday in a day of protest against tougher primary school tests, which they claim are causing stress anxiety in schools.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But Devon’s criticism went beyond mental health in the classroom. In a column for the Times Educational Supplement she accused the government of engineering “a social climate where it’s really difficult for any young person to enjoy optimal mental health”.<br />
<br />
She said parents “work every hour God sends”, which reduces quality family time, while spiralling poverty had pushed a million young people into dependence on food banks.<br />
<br />
On Wednesday Devon told the Guardian she was assessing her options. “I can confirm that I am no longer authorised to comment as the government’s mental health champion for schools.<br />
<br />
“The DfE have extended an opportunity for me to continue working on the peer-to-peer project they were seeking my advice on.” <br />
<br />
<br />
She was also in talks regarding another offer, adding: “Either way I’m not going anywhere and will continue to campaign for the rights of young people and those who teach them.”<br />
<br />
While Devon’s role with the government was unpaid to enable her to be completely independent and objective, the new cross-government mental health champion – which will be advertised shortly – is expected to be salaried.<br />
<br />
Appointing her as the first ever mental health champion for schools, education and childcare, minister Sam Gyimah said: “Natasha is an inspiration to many young people and I’m delighted to have her on board as our first mental health champion.”<br />
<br />
She is the founder the Self-Esteem Team and Body Gossip, organisations that deliver mental health education to young people and visit three schools a week, delivering classes to more than 50,000 teenagers, as well as parents and teachers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: “The department has got rid of a thorn in its flesh. Natasha has been a completely trenchant and very brave campaigner and advocate for children’s and young people’s mental health.<br />
<br />
“She has spoken forcefully about teenage and children’s mental health and she has said really important things. Firstly that resources available for dealing with young people’s mental ill-health are inadequate.<br />
<br />
“She has also said that the current government’s – and previous administration’s – education policies and the increase in testing have led to an increase in stress and pressure in schools.<br />
<br />
“That will have really annoyed the department. I’m not surprised they’ve let her go.”<br />
