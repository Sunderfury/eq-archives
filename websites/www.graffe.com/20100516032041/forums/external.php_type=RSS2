			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have posted my thoughts on the administration's foray into thinking it may want to avoid Miranda in some cases.   My thoughts there are all based on my analysis as a lawyer who very much believes in applying the rights in the constitution consistently.<br />
<br />
However, as much as I am the liberal in applying our 5th Amendment right against self incrimination in a manner consistent with that language and the cases interpreting it, I would like to have a parallel discussion on an issue without muddying up that thread.<br />
<br />
Here's my question - stepping back from the fact that the right IS in the Fifth Amendment and pretending we were going to write a brand new Bill of Rights to go into effect on 1/1/11, would YOU include a right against self incrimination in there?  If so, why?  What is the historical reason we as a society guaranty such a right?  Are those historical reasons still present today?  Is there a fundamental moral reason we don't want people to implicate themselves?  Is it a matter of trustworthiness or some base sense of fairness?<br />
<br />
I think this should be an interesting thread.  I hope folks can discuss this without jumping to absolutes and name calling.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to one site discussing the historical basis for the right we treasure - <a href="http://www.rcarterpittman.org/essays/Bill_of_Rights/Privilege_Against_Self-Incrimination.html" target="_blank">http://www.rcarterpittman.org/essays...imination.html</a></div>

			(May 14) -- A man in Washington state who branded his children like cattle has been acquitted of second-degree assault charges.<br />
<br />
A jury in Port Angeles deadlocked Thursday on two lesser charges of fourth-degree assault, and a judge declared a mistrial on those counts.<br />
<br />
The two teenage sons of 39-year-old Mark J. Seamands testified that they had wanted to be branded.<br />
<br />
The Sequim (SKWIM') man was branded himself. He testified he wanted to bring the family closer together while he was going through a divorce. Seamands' ex-wife said she was horrified when she saw the scars.<br />
<br />
Seamands' 18-year-old daughter also was branded, but the dad wasn't charged with assaulting her because she was old enough to give consent.<br />
<br />
The children were branded with the letters &quot;SK,&quot; which stands for &quot;Seamands' kids.&quot;

		<hr />
		
			CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Sarah Palin told NRA members meeting here that the only reason President Obama and his allies aren't trying to limit gun ownership rights is the fear of a political backlash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't doubt for a minute that, if they thought they could get away with it, they would ban guns and ban ammunition and gut the Second Amendment,&quot; Palin told the annual NRA gathering Friday. She urged some 9,000 NRA members to &quot;stop them in their tracks.&quot;<br />
<br />
The NRA's &quot;Celebration of American Values&quot; event was part political rally, part Tea Party gathering, with a parade of mostly Republican warm-up acts before Palin, the day's star, spoke. An NRA member, she electrified the crowd with a speech that defended Alaska, the Second Amendment and America, and attacked President Obama, the &quot;lamestream media,&quot; and gun control activists -- &quot;anti-Second Amendment rights activists,&quot; she called them. <br />
<br />
While some might dismiss her as an &quot;NRA gun-nut chick,&quot; she said, those folks don't get it. &quot;Criminals are, of course, to blame for the crimes,&quot; she said. &quot;It's the bad guys, not the piece of metal.&quot; All gun bans do is &quot;take them away from law-abiding citizens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Palin said Second Amendment rights  which &quot;protect the weak from the strong&quot; -- are &quot;so important especially&quot; for women and minorities.<br />
In front of this friendly crowd that interrupted her speech with applause and stood for much of it, she attacked hypocritical &quot;celebrities, Hollywood types,&quot; who produce violent &quot;shoot 'em-up action films.&quot; They employ armed bodyguards and live in gated communities, she said, but &quot;have a problem with you owning a gun to protect you and your family.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Those left-wing groups are supposed to be so tolerant of everybody's lifestyle, but they're intolerant of our lifestyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Palin took a comedy break midway through her speech to embrace her &quot;redneck&quot; spirit, saying that some jokes she has heard &quot;aren't funny, these are me.&quot; If shopping for dinner involves an orange vest or camo, then you're a redneck? That's me, she said.<br />
<br />
But, turning her remarks toward politics and November, she said, &quot;I can't wait for these midterm elections . . . We'll show them what we think of this fundamental transformation of America that we have been promised.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chelsey Vanderpool of San Diego gave her a thumbs-up. &quot;She seems honest, a real person,&quot; said the 25-year-old student, who has served in the Navy. Her husband is deployed and most of her family is military, she told me.<br />
<br />
While none of the other speakers had the star power of Palin, a few got ovations for choice one-liners.<br />
<br />
Ken Blackwell, former Ohio secretary of state and the author, with Ken Klukowski, of &quot;The Blueprint: Obama's Plan to Subvert the Constitution and Build an Imperial Presidency&quot;: <br />
<br />
&quot;Rights are gifts from God, not grants of state.&quot;<br />
<br />
Former United Nations ambassador John Bolton (the U.N. got booed): <br />
&quot;Today we've got a different kind of president, the first post-American president.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael Reagan, radio host and son of President Ronald Reagan:<br />
&quot;Liberals are like termites, eating away at the foundation of this country every day. That is their job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.): <br />
&quot;When our freedoms are threatened, battle is our calling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lt. Col. Oliver North:<br />
&quot;If there was no NRA, then we would have to invent one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.):<br />
I am &quot;a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just a few Democrats got face time, and they spent it shoring up their gun-loving bona fides. Rep. Heath Shuler of North Carolina spoke about NASCAR's moonshine-running roots and the joys of father-and-son hunting excursions. &quot;I don't think there's another member of Congress who buys more ammunition in a year than I do,&quot; he said.

			Rizzo said he was bothered by a recent spate of stories about cops who have retired from the force a day before they were arrested.<br />
<br />
Many have interpreted the sudden retirements as last-ditch attempts on the cops' behalf to save their pension benefits.<br />
<br />
Officer Anthony Floyd, a 14-year veteran, retired on Tuesday, and was charged the following day with assaulting and harrassing a woman he was dating.<br />
<br />
Another longtime cop, Tyrone Wiggins, retired a day before he was arrested on rape charges in November.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't have cops retiring one day, then getting arrested the next,&quot; Rizzo said.<br />
<br />
Even cops fired for gross misconduct are not blocked from receiving a pension. Also this week, Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey fired Sgt. Robert Ralston after the 21-year veteran admitted that he shot himself last month and created a phony story about being shot by a black man with cornrows.<br />
<br />
<b>Chapter 22-1300 of the city code states that a city employee could lose retirement benefits only if he or she pleads or is found guilty of perjury; accepting or offering a bribe; engaging in graft or corruption; theft, embezzlement or willful misapplication of city funds; malfeasance in office or engaging in conspiracy to commit any of the above.</b>
			
		<hr />

</div> This pension issue came up after officer Frank Tepper retired the day before he was arrested for murder and another officer was arrested for rape.<br />

on one hand hand he gets praised for it, maybe a medal, but is made by the &quot;voice of auhtority&quot; to tell others &quot;it was a bad thing!&quot;<br />

Another thing is, here we have a black dude, doing a good thing, he's obviously not some toff or celeb w*nker, but an ordinary bloke, so a great role model, and yet his brave action is said to be &quot;bad&quot; by authority...yet they say they want more positive black role models...conflicting stupidty, eh? <br />

Flashforward and Better Off Ted are getting the axe.  Scrubs is cancelled too, but it should never have come back this year anyway, so who cares? :)

Hope they at least let Flashforward wrap up their storyline, but since next week is the season finale (I think) I doubt they will.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Okay, keep up, because this gets a bit complicated. :)<br />
<br />
So this girl (we'll call her Girl A) told me that she likes me, and we've been friends for a really long time. She has a boyfriend, and she's said that she doesn't want to break up with him because she loves him. But she wants to start something with me.<br />
Another girl (we'll call her Girl B), who is another one of my close friends, posted an angry Facebook status about seeing something that ripped her heart out, so I commented that we should go for a walk so that she could tell me about it. We did, and she told me that she liked me, and that she saw Girl A kiss me in the hallway at school. So I told her all about Girl A, and the situation with her boyfriend. I also told Girl B that I like her too, and I do. <br />
So we went home, and I got on Facebook. I don't have a Myspace, but Girl A and B do. Girl A told me via Facebook that Girl B had posted a status about her. Something along the lines of &quot;Kissing girls and dating a guy, huh? You've got some issues honey, 'cause I'm sure your boyfriend doesn't know about this.&quot;. That really upset Girl A. Her boyfriend commented on it saying that he DID know about it and telling her to stay the f*** out of their relationship. Now both girls are mad at each other, and I'm in the middle and I feel really bad about causing all of this. <br />
I guess that's high school, huh? <br />
And I'm staying over the night at Girl A's house this weekend, and I dunno what to do.<br />
Oh, and my parents are talking about divorce, my soap opera got canceled, and some fat chick in my gym class doesn't like me because she thinks I'm weird. :D<br />
XOXO, <br />
