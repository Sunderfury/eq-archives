			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, everyone has their opinion. Everyone who reads this thread is going to imemdiately think, &quot;No No, its all about smokers&quot; or &quot;Its all about Mesquite&quot; <br />
<br />
Thats not what I'm asking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just Grilling. Charcoal or Gas? <br />
<br />
Personally? I used to be a huge fan of Gas, and for the last couple years, its all I've done. <br />
<br />
But for my son's birthday party yesterday, we went out to the regional park, got one of the picnic areas with a 4 ftx4ft charcoal grill and filled it up with 4 bags of charcoal in a great big pyramid, and along side it setup my gas grill. <br />
<br />
When it came down to it. We (me) burnt the hell out of everything over the charcoal to a crisp. 90% of all surfaces that hit that charcoal grill were black. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, it sealed in so much juice. Some people ripped off the bark, others ate it right on it. The meat we cooked on the gas grill was 100% a secondary product, against what burnt on the outside over the super hot charcoal. The charcoal was so hot that the hair on my arms was gone by the end of the day, but I have to say, after that experience, I'm highly considering going  and getting one of those extra large Weber charcoal grills. Way more impressed with that route after 4 years of not using one.<br />
<br />
And to be quite honest, I almost feel like I tasted the propane in tonight's recreation of everythign we did yesterday over charcoal.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Got this in e-mail, apparently, lots of people have been asking for this, and now it's available on Azure!<br />
<br />
HDInsight public preview <br />
We are pleased to announce that HDInsight is in public preview on Windows Azure, thanks to our strategic partnership with Hortonworks. HDInsight builds on the Hortonworks Data Platform to bring a 100 percent Apache Hadoop–based solution to the cloud. <br />
<br />
HDInsight offers the following benefits: <br />
  •   	Ease of deployment and use. With just a couple of clicks, you can deploy your Hadoop cluster on Windows Azure in minutes. Use simple web-based tools and application programming interfaces to interact with and monitor your cluster.<br />
  •   	Elasticity. By using HDInsight, you can quickly create a Hadoop cluster scaled to fit your demand when you need it, run your analysis, and shut down the cluster when you are done—leading to cost savings only possible in a cloud environment.<br />
  •   	Data insight through familiar tools like Excel. Analyze your Hadoop-resident data with Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software, PowerPivot, Power View, and other Microsoft Business Intelligence tools, thanks to integration with the Microsoft data platform.<br />
<br />
In the HDInsight public preview, you can deploy on demand a dedicated Hadoop cluster with up to 40 nodes. This limit is in place to allow as many customers as possible to use this new service and start building big data solutions in the cloud today. Your Hadoop cluster can be deployed for as long as you need it. However, we recommend running your cluster only when you need it, to reduce costs. <br />
<br />
During preview, we are offering HDInsight at a 50 percent discount.<br />
<br />
HDInsight pricing consists of two components: <br />
  •   	Head node. During preview, the head node is available only in the Extra Large instance size and is billed at $0.48 per hour per cluster, a 50 percent discount on the hourly rate for the standard Windows Azure Cloud Services Extra Large instance. <br />
  •   	Compute nodes. During preview, compute nodes are available only in the Large instance size and are billed at $0.24 per hour per instance deployed, a 50 percent discount on the hourly rate for the standard Cloud Services Large instance.<br />
<br />
Please note that, if you are using HDInsight through a 90-Day Free Trial or MSDN offer, you may exceed your free monthly compute hours in a matter of days. <br />
<br />
For additional pricing information, please see the Pricing Details webpage. For more information about HDInsight and how to get started today, please see the HDInsight feature webpage.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.<br />
<br />
So, my studio rig is fairly simple. MIDIPLUS 61 key MIDI controller, USB (m-audio clone). <br />
Toshiba Laptop, c765, or osmething. <br />
<br />
I haven't used either in 1 year. The last time I USED them, was for music production. SO I put them all into storage, in their original packaging, wrapped up nice, and you name it, so the elements couldn't damage them. (And yes, they stay in the closet in my man cave, so no, they're not outside, or in a storage locker). <br />
<br />
SO, today, I decide to rearrange my man cave, make a permanent fixture for my music rig, and just move EVERYTHING around nice and cleaner. <br />
<br />
I take the laptop out, start it up, it has some updates, and then i plug in my MIDI keyboard, decide to mess around with it to hear the sound balance, and run FL Studio .<br />
<br />
Open up the MIDI controls and what happens? &quot;Undefined External Error&quot;<br />
<br />
I go online, look for a bunch of solutions, and they all cite M-AUDIO related problems. I do every solution that is provided for M-Audio, but to no avail, it doesn't work. <br />
<br />
So then, I go back in and search for any possibility that there is a MIDIPLUS update - which there isn't. I contacted the company that makes my controller, and haven't heard a response yet, it is a weekend and all.<br />
<br />
has anyone else had this problem recently with a MIDI controller? This is just weird to me that this would happen. frustrating still, that I was using it a year ago in the same configuration, and now all of a sudden it it doesn't? Thats frickin' bullshit.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>SO my neighbor's 2003 Mitsubishi montero has been parked on the street for the last couple weeks. Radiator cracked RIGHT below the fill cap. LONG crack, too. Probably about 4&quot; or so. <br />
<br />
I've worked with alot of the high endurance epoxies for Drain repair, Coppet Inlet Repair, alot of relatively low PSI applications; nothing ever going even remotely close to 500. <br />
<br />
I'm not immediately fmiailar with the PSI in a radiator, but I was always under the impression that at max heat, it was only several atmospheres above 10 (which would max out at around 400, if I'm correct?). <br />
<br />
Anyhow, I was just curious if anyone has ever fixed a cracked radiator with an epoxy (for plastic) substance before. He's a real nice guy. he's got some whacky estimates all around town, and if worse comes to worst, I'll help him replace the radiator himeslf, but for the level of repairs that I've completely bypassed by patching, i figure it couldn't hurt, right? <br />
<br />
Anyone else ever done this?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Throwing out the challenge to all you doodlers and sketchers in the house, I have just set up an LLC with the name &quot;Axacting Data Consulting, LLC&quot; and I'd like a logo. The purpose of this business is for 1099 work doing work with Dynamics AX, or &quot;Axapta&quot;. There is a branding logo for AX products, and I'd like the logo to echo the style to some degree, it looks like three sails layered atop each other.<br />
<br />
I like clean and simple, sans fonts, like Segoe UI, for example.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://carryingthewhale.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/axapta.jpg" border="0" alt="" /> <img src="http://carryingthewhale.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/moderndynamics.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
I was thinking it would look neat if the icon were somehow merged with the first word &quot;Axacting&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let's see how it looks!</div>

<br />
ITS $129!<br />
<br />
I mean, I can't expect alot from it, but it boasts 700 nails per charge, and 60 nails a second in auto fire mode. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't do alot of crown molding, or baseboard, etc, because I try to avoid it in my line of work. If I have to move it, I try and keep it intact to the drywall, and I patch the drywall back in after. <br />
<br />
This could even the playing field. (And yes, i've always been aware of a pneumatic, but I hate carrying around a compressor). <br />
<br />
RIDGID has a $259 15 gage nailer thats cordless 18v, and I've been looking at it *alot,* but I'm highly considering picking up this Ryobi. for $129, i already ahve 2 of their batteries for my first 18v drill I ever boguht, and their Laser Guided circular saw (why ridgid didnt' adopt the laser, I have no idea).</div>
