		<div>This game is one of the most fun I've ever played, and definitely the most fun game that I'm currently playing.<br />
<br />
But I'm still not happy and comfortable with a single one of my characters.  I've already re-rolled one of them since guild invites went out, and I seriously think I'm going to re-roll the rest.<br />
<br />
Permanent skill points and attribute points make me go batty.  I'm just so afraid of screwing a character up that I constantly go &quot;oh shit, I'm not going to like that later&quot; and re-roll.<br />
<br />
At this point I think I'm just going to pick one class (leaning toward engineer), figure out a skill and attribute plan I'm decently comfortable with, and take it through the game for better or worse.<br />
<br />
We'll see if that plan actually stands up.</div>

		<div>The lack of respecs will seriously shortern the life-span of this game for me. It's fun, and I enjoy it, but I will *not* be rolling another Summoner and levelling them up just to try out a demon focussed build instead of my elemental focussed build I'm using now. <br />
<br />
I'm also petrified that spending points on agility &amp; strength (only a few) to wear gear will kill me long term because of the willpower requirements for summoning elementals...</div>

		<div>There are tons of ways to play the game though, so there really isn't a right or wrong. I remember a post from one of the devs and he said Bill Roper plays a Guardian differently than he does and he is the one who basically created the class. Roper jumps in the middle and uses a lot of stuns. The dev uses the grappler and pulls in mobs one at a time. <br />
<br />
On my evoker, he is going to be a jack of all trades, master of none. I have taken a lot of different abilities so I can be prepared in any situation. That is just my play style though. Others will be heavily focused in one or two areas. It's all a matter of personal preference. If I find something that I really don't like, then I roll up another one and make the changes. It really doesn't take that long to level up. It gets even faster as you learn more of the nuances of the game. <br />
<br />
I am having hella fun in the game though. <br />
<br />
Last night I was a sad sad man though. I bought a mask off a vendor because I thought it looked cool and am wearing it now. My old one was a little better, but didn't look as good.</div>

		<div>While I'm doing the same thing skill-wise that I used to do in Diablo 2 - store em until needed - I'm finding I need to do the same thing for stat points.<br />
<br />
As a Blademaster at 22, I have over 50 unspent stat and 10 unspent skill points.  My strength is pretty much topped out, as I gain more &quot;heavy&quot; gear.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I feel I could use a full string of upgrades, since half of what I'm wearing is from the late tens early teens, but it still works, and I did just upgrade my swords.  But as the items come rolling in, I upgrade my stats as needed.<br />
<br />
I hope you're able to figure out your niche, because it's a game, you're not supposed to be stressed!  :)</div>

		<div>I don't care too much about respecs either way.  I can adapt.  I'm just frustrated that I have yet to even get beyond Cholocate Park because I doubt my specs and such, while everyone else is having fun in Act 4+.  :p<br />
<br />
But there is a certain bit of schizophrenia in FSS's design.  They want the attribute/skill system of Diablo, but the leveling pace of an MMO, with the character attachment to match.  (Like people with Zombots, who lose them upon re-rolling).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I'll just at least try to stick through one class through the end of act 5, then maybe make subsequent characters Hardcore so that specs won't even matter longterm.  :)</div>

I dunno...I get stressed out when fighting, all the time (I don't second guess decisions though - no point really).  But I find that kind of stress fun...because once the fighting is over it feels so good! (Providing I'm standing in the end ;))  Maybe those are just different kinds of stress.</div>
