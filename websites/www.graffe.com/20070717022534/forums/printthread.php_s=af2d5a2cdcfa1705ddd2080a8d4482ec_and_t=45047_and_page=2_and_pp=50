		<div>I find it odd that while this still consistently happens to me for no apparent reason at all ( I dont move, I dont cast, I do nothing, not even breath!) that times when it should fail, it does not.<br />
<br />
THe other day during a fight, a dot from the mob wer were killing wore off of one of my guild mates, and &quot;appears&quot; to have caused harvest to fail.  The two effects, the dot wearing off and harvest firing, happened almost at the same time but the dot wore off just an n'th of a second  first.   Yet, that same night, I was helping a friend do Cursed cycle in SSRA for a memory,  and the first snake has the fd proc or ae,  I was very lom from killing triggers and the snake, and at half heatlh hit my harvest, and prayed.  Soon as  it cast, I got hit by the stun and fd.  I stood up, and harvest still fired!  Given how touchy it can be, you would think this would have interrupted/cancelled it, but it didnt.<br />
<br />
Its almsot like, its coded bacwards, and things that should be killing it aren't and things that shouldn't be killing it, are.  Anyhow . . .</div>

its been happening to me while i have been soloing in empty zones for bic pieces.  lag doesn't seem to be an issue for me, nor bard effects.  i am alone, use up my mana, hit harvest and sit.  happened twice to me on tuesday in yxtta.  i do notice it on raids and in groups, but it is clear when i am alone and cast it then sit it should hit me and not disappear.<br />

its not me casting obviously or else it would be in the log, nor moving, ffs i am rooted.  with as many wizards as are experiancing this it is clear it is happening.  if you have never seen this then great for you but for everyone else it should be easy to check your logs for it.  just search for 'harvest' and you will see every time its memmed, cast by any wizard as well as yourself, and when it lands.  will also see the aa harvest, but what is important is to see your cast followed by the message indicating you received it three ticks later.</div>

		<div>I don't think most people think you're lying or mistaken, banghi.  But the same goes for those of us who don't report seeing it -- it's not that we're being inattentive, it's that it really <i>never</i> happens to us.  I have deliberately monitored my Patient Harvest every single time I've cast it since this thread started, hundreds of times, and not once has it failed to act exactly as expected.  Other reliable sources report the same.<br />
<br />
Which makes it the damnedest thing... whatever's different?  We all get hit with AEs, bard songs, whatever, as well as the absence of them, so I doubt that's the trigger -- it's gotta be something environmental.  Client connections in an online game are each unique, so that's an obvious suspect.  Could it possibly be something with the server itself?  You Luclin folks seem to commonly encounter it, but I don't think I've heard of anyone on Saryrn who's reported it (and there are a lot of us here on Graffe's).</div>

yeah, sorry if i inferred any different.  just stating that while a number of wizards have never seen this happen just as many do seem to have noticed it.  regardless of the reason i just want to know why and what i can do to avoid it.  nothing worse than being at 20% mana and thinking ill get a boost then have to wait the seven minutes (don't have rank3 yet) for it to pop again.<br />

quite possible, i am open to any real suggestions.  saying moving broke it doesn't apply due to the root.  from my personal experiance it has happened in zones where i was the only one so no effects from other classes (i.e. bard songs, auras etc.) or lag seem to apply.  i have played this class long enough to know when i screw up a spell like this by attacking or casting accidentally, but recognize when neither of those apply.  my logs would show me casting if that were the case and i know i wasn't.  i also know no buffs dropped at some of the times due to soloing with minimal/self buffs.<br />
<br />
didn't even think of client/server issues, that sounds quite plausible.  maybe its due to the ui i use (haven't used default for ages) sending something to the server that breaks it.  with as many that don't ever see this i know i can be one of you ;) but just don't know what is wrong for me and the others.</div>

But most of the time, thats not the case.  SOmetimes Axxius, I sit after casting but sometimes not, it doesnt seem  dependent, but not sure.  I used to always sit right after, to wait, then I noticed sooo many fails,  I stopped sitting,  and  just took my hands off my keys when I hit it, and backed away.  Still happened /shrug</div>

Personally, I've been watching and have never had Patient Harvest fail.  (Unless I do something stupid like suddenly notice I'm missing a self-buff and re-cast it.)<br />
<br />
I normally cast Patient Harvest, hit hotkey #2 (sit), then lean back and don't touch anything until my manabar jumps.  Sometimes it takes longer than 18 seconds, I just wait a little longer.<br />
<br />
I often duo with a bard who has melodies going, so bard buffs dropping quite often-doesn't affect me.<br />
<br />
I use the default UI, Banghi, but I have a real hard time believing it is the UI doing something.  Isn't the UI all on the client side?  What kind of information could that be sending to the server that might do something funny?<br />
<br />
Well, I guess I don't have any answers either.<br />

actually i thought i stated quite clearly that it fades on me when i am alone in a zone.  in my mind i have no doubt that whatever is causing this does not necessarily have to do with other buffs fading.  for someone to see a bard buff fade as the same time as our harvest is not proof, ffs bard buffs only last 3 ticks, we see them fade all the time.  i have seen bard buffs fade at the same time as harvest, but imo that just means its timer was up when harvest poofed.<br />
<br />
so this morning i decided to try something different.  went to south felwith (hate going north to get there, wth's up with that?  must be something about us high/stoned elves) and stood there by myself with a (gasp) autofire program hitting harvest for me over and over.  then i went to bed.  just got up after a few hours and lo and behold, with about 25ish casts i saw failures on two.  not in a group, in one of the most empty zones i could find, all my buffs had faded (probably should have just clicked them off) by the time the two failures happened.  oh yeah, and if it wasn't clear, i was afk.<br />
<br />
don't use autofire programs myself (no forage, no bow attacks) but thought it would be a good way to test this.  i <i>feel</i> like it happens all the time, but wanted to get some actual data that wasn't influenced by my being at the keyboard.  with those results it seems to me its roughly about 1 in every 10-15 casts.  a larger sample would get a better failure percentage, but in my mind there is no doubt that something is going on with this spell.  maybe not for everyone, but it is happening for some of us.</div>

		<div>Banghi, my point was, that we did not establish that bard songs/short buff timers were NOT a cause.  ONE person said they don't have a problem, or don't notice a corelation, does not mean it has been ruled out.  <br />
<br />
THere seem to be many many dif reasons this is failing,  as yes I have had it fail alone in a zone, no ae's no bards no nothing, and I have had it fail during a full raid etc.<br />
<br />
THe POINT is, we cannot rule out ANYTHING, or any ONE thing/cause.  The POINT of this is NOT to tell people they are stupid or wrong, but to list circumstances/correlations that each one of us is noting when and IF harvest is failing for YOU.<br />
<br />
If harvest never fails for you, fine, you don't need to post.  If harvest fails for you, post where you were, what you were doing, what you noticed about it when it happened etc.  Very simple.  But don't try and say just because it doesnt happen that way for you someone else is wrong.<br />
<br />
None of us knows why it sometimes fails with out apparent reason, and there are varying reports of it failing under many dif cricumstances.  THere are also some people reporting it doesn't ever fail for them.   So lets just list and discuss!  The more information we can  post here, the better chance we have of figuring it out and or getting it fixed!</div>

imo the best way to figure it out is to remove <i>all possible variables </i>until we get to the root of the problem, thus my afk test.  i don't rule out that there may be multiple causes to what we see, but i am not trying to make this more complicated than it needs to be.  obviously other wizards want to, dang i won't stop them from what i perceive as spinning their wheels, nor will i tell them they are doing it in futility.  they may come up with something.<br />
<br />
i belive if we can hone in on the base issue and figure out why it happens at times where we are alone with no buffs that all other occurances will fall into place.  if siene and the others want to compare notes and say they were in anguish and perfermers psalm faded at the same time the harvest dropped, well more power to them.  i seriously doubt much will be gleaned that way, but hey, thats exactly what this thread is for.<br />
<br />
i am not looking at bard songs as a cause, i know it happens when they are not a factor so i don't bother.  others are 'convinced' that they play a role.  yet others insist this never happens for them.  maybe all three groups are right, perhaps there are players that never see it, some who only get it from bard songs and others who have it happen more consistantly.  but we won't know squat if no one posts.<br />
<br />
this thread was practically dead for a month, i would rather have people saying what, where and why they think it happens to them than to have it languish and be ignored.  and i can't stress my faith in the log file and would hope all would run theirs by default so that they could go back and look at a week or months worth of logs and see what they can dig out of those.  imo the log file is our best tool to figuring this out, but am open to all suggestions.</div>

		<div>Yeah, actually, I wanted to thank you for your efforts banghi, those logs &amp; tests are very helpful for the diagnosis.<br />
<br />
One thought that occurred to me... The only thing that we know of that disrupts PH is spell-casting -- you can't move, and it doesn't seem to be caused by any outside agency acting *on* you.  So what could make the server think you've cast a spell, even though you didn't?<br />
<br />
Well, how about equipment?  I wonder if there's some passive focus effect that could trigger this?  Look up the epic effects, for instance -- Lucy shows their duration as &quot;3.0 mins @L1 to 3 hour(s) 15.0 mins @L65&quot;.  Well, what does that mean?  I postulate that the effect is not really coded as permanent, so much as a persistent &amp; invisible buff.  What if it happened to &quot;recast&quot; itself while you're harvesting?<br />
<br />
I don't think it would be the epics themselves, because probably half the wizards in Norrath carry one of them, and this issue doesn't seem to affect all of them.  But perhaps some other piece does?  It's kind of a long shot, but at least it's a plausible explanation.  Perhaps you could retry your tests while naked, banghi?</div>

		<div>It can't be server related. I get it sometimes and am on your server spiffe :) I use the default UI also and get it sometimes so it's most likely not that.<br />
<br />
One thing I don't think was mentioned (probably doesn't matter, but it'd be good to see in these results), but what rank are you all using?<br />
<br />
I got rank II in the first few days so I don't recall it happening on rank I, but I didn't have it long enough to test it at all. I really doubt this is the problem but I don't think anyone is mentioning hte rank they use.<br />
<br />
So when you include why you think its failing, include which rank you are using (or if it's never failing, what rank are you using?). It could even be that rank 2 is broken or something while rank 1/3 work or something.<br />
<br />
I personally think it's to do with lag though since it seems half get it dropping, and half don't and hardware/net connection would be the main difference between the two I'd think (whether its connection or video lag). Maybe post your hardware / internet connection / settings you run the game at if you are or aren't getting it to drop.<br />
<br />
The person (banghi I think) that runs the tests over night, Try turning on Shadows (that'll kill ya with like 50 people around!), all graphics on high, Pixel stuff, everything maxed anyways, then go do it in POK or a packed section in the bazaar somewhere super populated so hopefully your computer will lag due to the hardware of your computer. See if it is more common then the non laggy populated zones (Make sure you get the options inside the ALT O, video , advanced options too (shadows and stuff aren't in the start up options)</div>

Incidentally, does anyone know of an equivalent of awk for DOS (or Windows) - findstr sucks for parsing :p.</div>

hahaha nope :) read post number 2 in this topic!<br />
<br />
You probably thinking when I told you I never fizzle'd instants because of the aaexp bug? or something? You were probably talking about harvest while I was talking about that haha, sometimes I'm a little busy in game and not totally reading what people are talking about! But that'd put some blame on me, Lets just leave it at you have tainted data and it's not my fault hah :)</div>

awk (a Unix thing) does rather more complicated text parsing, like being able to find blocks of text between two strings on different lines, or the x lines after a found line - I was looking for an equivalent on DOS.<br />

Although I could always put Linux on my PC and dual-boot, I guess :).</div>

well i didn't really /petition this, but as i have given up on eq i thought i would poke a little fun at this continuing problem.  as kela seemed to get some notice with mspaint i thought i would toss out what i imagine would happen if someone actually tried to get sony to pay attention to this...</div>
