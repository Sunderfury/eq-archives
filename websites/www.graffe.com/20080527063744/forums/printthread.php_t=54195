				The rules of the wine tasting were simple. Twenty five of the best wines under twelve dollars were nominated by independent wine stores in the Boston area. The Globe then assembled a panel of wine professionals to select their top picks in the red and white category. All of the wines were tasted blind.<br />
<br />
The result is a beguiling list of delicious plonk. But I was most interested in just how little overlap there was between the different critics. In fact, only one wine - the 2006 Willm Alsace Pinot Blanc from France - managed to make the list of every critic. Most of the wines were personal favorites, and appeared on only one of the lists.<br />
<br />
So much for objectivity. But results like this shouldn't be surprising. I've blogged about this before, but it's such a cool experiment that it's worth repeating. In 2001, Frederic Brochet, of the University of Bordeaux, conducted two separate and very mischievous experiments. In the first test, Brochet invited 57 wine experts and asked them to give their impressions of what looked like two glasses of red and white wine. The wines were actually the same white wine, one of which had been tinted red with food coloring. But that didn't stop the experts from describing the "red" wine in language typically used to describe red wines. One expert praised its "jamminess," while another enjoyed its "crushed red fruit." Not a single one noticed it was actually a white wine.<br />
<br />
The second test Brochet conducted was even more damning. He took a middling Bordeaux and served it in two different bottles. One bottle was a fancy grand-cru. The other bottle was an ordinary vin du table. Despite the fact that they were actually being served the exact same wine, the experts gave the differently labeled bottles nearly opposite ratings. The grand cru was "agreeable, woody, complex, balanced and rounded," while the vin du table was "weak, short, light, flat and faulty". Forty experts said the wine with the fancy label was worth drinking, while only 12 said the cheap wine was.<br />
<br />
What these experiments neatly demonstrate is that the taste of a wine, like the taste of everything, is not merely the sum of our inputs, and cannot be solved in a bottom-up fashion. It cannot be deduced by beginning with our simplest sensations and extrapolating upwards. When we taste a wine, we aren't simply tasting the wine. This is because what we experience is not what we sense. Rather, experience is what happens when our senses are interpreted by our subjective brain, which brings to the moment its entire library of personal memories and idiosyncratic desires. As the philosopher Donald Davidson argued, it is ultimately impossible to distinguish between a subjective contribution to knowledge that comes from our selves (what he calls our "scheme") and an objective contribution that comes from the outside world ("the content"). Instead, in Davidson's influential epistemology, the "organizing system and something waiting to be organized" are hopelessly interdependent. Without our subjectivity we could never decipher our sensations, and without our sensations we would have nothing to be subjective about. In other words, we shouldn't be surprised that different people like different bottles of cheap wine.<br />

		<div>Yeah, it's not actually that hard to figure out if a wine is good -- drink it and decide for yourself! It's just really hard to trust unknown experts like the above, who are clearly influenced by too much more than what it tastes like.<br />
<br />
This is why all those point systems are crap. You're vastly better off tasting the wine at the winery (if you're lucky enough to live near several, like I am) or at a good wine store conducting tastings. Or just find a good wine store and say, "I like wines a, b, and c, and want to spend under d dollars." If they're worthy of your business they'll hand you a few bottles you'll like.<br />
<br />
That second test is incredibly damning -- the experts are clearly ignorant of the most fundamental principle of wine drinking: maximize quality/cost ratio. Decent (i.e. not great) tasting expensive wine? It's crap. Decent tasting cheap wine? It rocks. Buy a bunch. =)</div>

If you want good wine, and have space to make a small cellar go to a shop and ask to buy a couple of cases, and like Poly says theyll likley give you at least one of each type of bottle to try and make your mind up. <br />

				the main difference between red and white wine is that grape juice used to make red wine contains skins, seeds, and stems. This is significant for the following reason: leaving juice to mix together with the woody bits (known as maceration) causes the finished product to contain something we briefly mentioned earlier &#8211; tannins. If the term tannin is bugging you because you don't really get what we're talking about, just think about a strong cup of tea. That woody taste is tannin. In wine, it can lend a wonderful complexity to a red wine. As a general rule of thumb, red wines are heavier and more complex than white wines. White wines are usually a good place for beginners to start because they are initially more palatable to novices since they often tend to be sweeter.

		<div>Not surprised at all.  People can have such different taste when it comes to wine, it's all about your preference typically.  We live in Oregon wine country and we go tasting a lot.  We were going almost every weekend this summer with friends, neighbors, family or out of town guests.  I find it funny how the out-of-towners come in and head off to all these popular labels because they are listed in some magazine and pay up to $30 a bottle or $10 tastings when they are vineyards around with MUCH better wine for way under that.    <br />
<br />
One of my fave things to do is find good cheap wine under $20, hell even under $10 we can find decent table wines.  You won't find them in a yuppy wine magazine with a lot of awards but to me they taste better then some $50+ bottles I've had at nice restaraunts.</div>

		<div>Red wine is an acquired taste. Many very good reds are very hard to drink if you're not used to them. The fancy red you got was probably one of these. You're better off working your way up slowly, starting with some of the more accessible reds like syrah/shiraz or pinot noir or merlot. Again, a good wine store is the best place to get started. Make sure you don't just buy something cheap at random, though -- lots of cheap wine sucks (not all, of course) and you can end up thinking red wine sucks when it's just the cheap stuff that actually does.</div>

Two Buck Chuck isn't crap, but it isn't that good, either. Fine for beginners, but it really doesn't taste that good, at least if you're used to good wine. OTOH, on my taste/cost scale is does score pretty high, if you can drink it all (I had to pour out the last bottle of Two Buck Chuck I tried, it was so undrinkable for me).</div>

<br />
The two main rules I follow when choosing and drinking wine are as follows:<br />
<br />
1.) Drink what you like.  <br />
<br />
This is very key in my opinion, don't try and force yourself to drink something you don't like because you're suppose to like it, and if you like something that someone else doesn't, don't let that alter your opinion either.  Everyone tastes things differently, as this article proves, let your own tastes be the judge of what is good and bad.  Be open to new wines and new tastes but don't change your own opinions based on anything other than your own tastes.<br />
<br />
2.)  Don't let price dictate your choices.<br />
<br />
A wine being expensive doesn't make its good, a wine being cheap doesn't make it bad.  Taste is what matters most.  So one needs develop how to choose wines without being able to taste them and not get burned and doing it by price isn't a very good plan.  Learn about grapes and region and wineries and that will help you learn how to choose blind of taste.  For example, I'm a pretty big fan of Oregon Pinot and I've had 15 dollar bottles of Oregon Pinot that I'd choose every time over 60 dollar bottles of California Pinot that I've had.  I've also had a lot of people argue with me about this, once again back to rule #1, its my tastes that are important, not theirs so fuck em.</div>
