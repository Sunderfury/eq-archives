			ST. LOUIS (AP) - After he was convicted of armed robbery in 2000, Cornealious Anderson was sentenced to 13 years behind bars and told to await instructions on when and where to report to prison. But those instructions never came.<br />
<br />
So Anderson didn't report. He spent the next 13 years turning his life around - getting married, raising three kids, learning a trade. He made no effort to conceal his identity or whereabouts. Anderson paid taxes and traffic tickets, renewed his driver's license and registered his businesses.<br />
<br />
Not until last year did the Missouri Department of Corrections discover the clerical error that kept him free. Now he's fighting for release, saying authorities missed their chance to incarcerate him.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I haven't seen a topic about this yet. This came up at work. I work among a great majority of right wingers, so whenever the &quot;gubbermint&quot; goes infringing on people's rights, I'm the first to hear about it. Most of my research only came up with this video: Pretty cool, at about 44 seconds in, a dude gets bolt-tazed not once, not twice, not thrice but FOUR times, and each time, yanks them out. THEN he even kicks the police dog, who further has nothing to do with him. <br />

<br />
<br />
From what I understand, this guy who owns the Bundy Ranch in Nevada also was found to own the only lands that some threatened to near extinction species of tortoise also inhabits. So the BLM is stepping in and taking cattle... who knows what else. I don't know the exact details, because everything seems a little sketchy. <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe someone else knows about this better than I? <br />
<br />
(The first 3 minutes of the video are pretty cool. the rest is just over done).</div>

			For the first time in history, scientists have successfully implanted lab-grown vaginal organs in human patients.<br />
<br />
The organs, grown with the patients’ own tissue, were implanted between June 2005 and October 2008 in four teenage girls who each lacked or had an underdeveloped vagina and uterus, the result of a rare genetic condition called Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.<br />
<br />
Years after the two-hour procedures, annual follow-up visits showed that the surgeries had been a success: The new organs functioned normally, including during sex, and their tissue was indistinguishable from the native tissue that had already been there.

			BOSTON (CBS) – A Wakefield man was ordered held on $100,000 bail Wednesday on several charges connected to a bomb scare at the finish line of the Boston Marathon Tuesday, hours after memorial tributes there.<br />
<br />
Kevin Edson, 25, who also goes by the name Kayvon Edson, is charged with possession or use of a hoax device and making a false bomb threat.  If convicted, those carry up to five and up to 20 years in state prison, respectively, according to Jake Wark, the spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley.<br />
<br />
Edson, who also has an address in Mission Hill, is also charged with disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, and disturbing a public assembly.  All are misdemeanors carrying minimal jail time or a fine.<br />
<br />
He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Boston Municipal Court.<br />
<br />
Edson, according to police and witnesses, was barefoot, wearing blue and yellow face paint and a long black veil while screaming “Boston Strong” in the middle of Boylston Street at 6:50 p.m. Tuesday.  It was a short time after the city marked the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings.<br />
<br />
At the time, the area was open to the public, but the street was still closed to traffic.<br />
<br />
When Edson was stopped by officers, police say he told them he had a rice cooker in his backpack. That’s when the area was evacuated, the bomb squad was called in and Edson was arrested. Bus and subway service was also suspended.<br />
<br />
The bag was detonated as a precaution.<br />
<br />
A source told CBS News that the rice cooker in the bag was full of confetti.<br />
<br />
A court psychologist said Wednesday that Edson has a history of psychiatric problems, but he has been off his medication for months.<br />
<br />
Edson’s family elaborated on that in a statement issued Wednesday afternoon.<br />
<br />
Prosecutor Susan Terrey said Edson told police he knew what he was doing, calling the incident “performance art.” Edson is a student at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston.<br />
<br />
He was sent to Bridgewater State Hospital for a psychiatric evaluation and is due back in court May 7.<br />
<br />
“If this was a performance, it was the most irresponsible, senseless, and selfish performance I can imagine,” Conley said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.<br />
<br />
“It was also criminal. It was akin to shouting ‘fire’ in a theater. People were put in fear, public transportation was disrupted, and a day of somber remembrance and reflection was marred by this defendant’s choices. There could not have been a worse time or place for this inexcusable behavior.”<br />
<br />
Edson’s brother TJ posted this message on Facebook after the incident:<br />

			I ask for those of you who know my family to take a moment to pray for myself, my sister, my mother, and my father. My dad is an American Hero. The kind of man you hate to see on his last legs sick with cancer. But that is the reality. It is stressful enough as it is.<br />
<br />
Another reality is that my brother is a different kind of sick. What he did at the finish line earlier today is absurd and shameful. It should not be considered art or condoned in any way. <br />
<br />
Do not play into that. He is a sick person with multiple diagnoses. Unfortunately, no consequences of his abnormal behavior were dire enough for him to shape up before he thought something like this could get him that fame he always chased. Ultimately, he is a disillusioned and very sick individual. I apologize to anyone that takes offense to his actions as his brother. <br />
<br />
My family has done all we can to foster Kevin’s mental health. He is an artist. I am an artist. I understand that much. Thank you God that he did not hurt anybody.

			DETROIT (WWJ) – A new study finds low levels of the “sunshine vitamin” could be keeping some people on the couch.<br />
<br />
Vitamin D may make the difference between an active and a more sedentary lifestyle among severely obese people, according to research out Ireland.<br />
<br />
Researchers found severely obese people who were also vitamin D-deficient walked more slowly and were less active overall than their counterparts who had healthy vitamin D levels.<br />
<br />
The study, published in the Endocrine Society’s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism (JCEM),  measured physical functioning and vitamin D levels in about 250 severely obese people.<br />
<br />
Researchers found the group with the highest vitamin D levels had the fastest walking times and highest amount of self-reported physical activity.<br />
 This group also had the lowest average BMI of study volunteers.<br />
<br />
One of the study’s authors, Tomás Ahern of St. Columcille’s Hospital and St. Vincent’s University Hospital in Dublin, said the severely obese are already eight times more likely to have poor physical function than people with a healthy BMI.<br />
<br />
“Improving vitamin D status should improve quality of life and may decrease the risk of early death in people with severe obesity,” Ahern said, in a media release. “This could be a simple matter of spending more time outside, since sun exposure can boost the body’s natural vitamin D production.”<br />
<br />
A person whose body mass index exceeds 40 is considered severely obese.  According to the study’s authors, about 6.5 of American adults are in this category.

(The Ducks sat their captain, Ryan Getzlaf, in this final game so Teemu was the captain for the night.)<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I don't normally post deal threads, as there is pretty much always a great deal for some game or another, but I remember someone saying they were looking for a deal on this, and the GMG thread at CAG doesn't seem to be getting proper updates, so it's entirely possible you may miss the sale even if you were looking.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Green Man Gaming is having a sale week, with each day having a different set of games. Yesterday featured Batman: Arkham Origins but I wasn't able to post about it before it got too late for stragglers to take advantage of the deal. Well, the deal seems to still be active, so if you were looking for this game at a cheap price, now is the time to get it. If you do happen to miss the deal, don't worry about it, the price is sure to go this low again in the Summer (or at the very least, Winter) Steam sales.<br />
<br />
Standard disclaimer applies. Green Man Gaming is an international site, so some people may have issues with their banks disputing the charges. I've had zero problems with them in the past. There may also be a promotional general use code for the site for up to 20% off, but I'm not sure if it will stack.<br />
<br />
If you don't want Batman AO for $10 but clicked this thread anyway, they have a lot of other stuff on sale as well. The highlight of day 2 seems to be the new Thief game for $25.</div>

Met Flying Squad officers 'plotted corrupt cash van kidnap' By Ed Davey<br />
 <br />
BBC News, London<br />
 <br />
<br />
Flying squad officers allegedly plotted a kidnap for £50,000. <br />

<br />
Corrupt police in the Flying Squad were suspected of plotting to kidnap the partner of a cash van driver to obtain a £50,000 ransom, secret intelligence reports obtained by the BBC reveal.<br />
<br />
According to the documents, a group of London-based officers hatched the plot in the mid-1990s.<br />
<br />
Police sources told the BBC the reports were part of a &quot;lorry-load&quot; of documents thought shredded by the Met.<br />
<br />
The Met said it does not comment on leaked intelligence reports. <br />
<br />
The documents say the plot began after the cash-driver's partner was kidnapped by bank robbers. <br />
<br />
The driver was ordered to go to his depot and fill a suitcase with £50,000 to secure her release - a style of heist known as a &quot;Tiger kidnap&quot;.<br />

 <br />
Five days later officers from the Flying Squad began to investigate. <br />
<br />
But the reports claim officers then decided to repeat the plot themselves - targeting the same driver and his partner once again.<br />
<br />
Already involved in probing the first crime, they knew they would be tasked with investigating any second, identical offence.<br />
<br />
This meant they would in effect be investigating themselves - so they could get away with the crime.<br />
<br />
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe  Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was grilled over the shredded documents by MPs <br />
The intelligence reads: &quot;Information was received that officers attached to the Flying Squad were involved in the planning and commission of armed robberies and other criminal acts.<br />
<br />
&quot;The van driver was to be approached and shown a ring belonging to his wife.&quot;<br />
<br />
When anti-corruption police learned of the conspiracy the officers were investigated and their phones were tapped.<br />
<br />
Hand grenade<br />
<br />
Their investigation forms the basis of the two intelligence reports obtained by the BBC.<br />
<br />
One of the reports continues: &quot;It was learned the next robbery was planned... when the driver would be attacked as he parked his vehicle. <br />
<br />

Met Police Flying Squad<br />
The Flying Squad is a branch of the Metropolitan Police set up to investigate armed robberies<br />
It has been established for almost a century <br />
Among the most famous plots the squad have investigated are the Great Train Robbery and the attempted Millennium Dome Raid in 2000<br />
<br />
&quot;His house keys would be taken and one of the 'gang' would leave and return with his wife's ring and tell the driver she would be hurt if he did not do as instructed.<br />
<br />
&quot;This scenario has allegedly been used on one other occasion by the officer when he netted £40,000.&quot;<br />
<br />
It goes on: &quot;General information is [the informant] was introduced to this officer about 18 months ago. [The informant] has a gun for which the officer supplied him with 100 bullets.<br />
<br />
&quot;He [one of the officers] was also supplied with a grenade.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cash van (library) A cash van was robbed in the mid-90s; corrupt officers allegedly planned to repeat the offence <br />
It is understood that at this point the officers abandoned the plot after becoming aware of anti-corruption investigations.<br />
<br />
Police had been hoping to arrest them when they attempted to execute the kidnap. When this did not happen there was not enough evidence to prosecute.<br />
<br />
Several police sources have corroborated to the BBC that the reports are genuine.<br />

Confidential report<br />
 <br />
The disclosure comes weeks after a mass shredding of documents relating to a corruption inquiry in the Metropolitan Police was revealed.<br />
<br />
The &quot;lorry-load&quot; of material was shredded over two days. It was related to an anti-corruption inquiry that began in 1993 and continued for a lengthy period of time.<br />
<br />
The BBC asked the Met whether it could find and account for the two intelligence reports.<br />
<br />
The force is understood to have found one of the reports backed up on computer.<br />
<br />
At the time of publication the Met has not been able to find the other report, despite having been made aware of the issue five days ago.<br />
<br />
London Assembly Member Jenny Jones, who sits on the Police and Crime Committee, said: &quot;It sounds more like the plot of a bad police film than anything you would connect to the Metropolitan Police.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's also very concerning the information was apparently lost in the police shredding.<br />
<br />
&quot;The commissioner is going to have to make a clear statement on these matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel Morgan Daniel Morgan's body was found in a London pub car park in 1987 <br />
One of the allegedly-corrupt officers mentioned in the intelligence reports was known to be friendly with those suspected of murdering Daniel Morgan.<br />
<br />
Mr Morgan was killed with an axe in a pub car park in 1987 before he could blow the whistle on police corruption. <br />
<br />
His brother Alastair said of the latest disclosures: &quot;Why has it been kept in the dark so long?<br />
<br />
&quot;And if this is a widespread phenomenon, how much else has been buried? We just don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
The BBC has now traced the kidnap victim, who was unaware she was the target of a suspected corrupt police plot.<br />

Met spokeswoman<br />
 <br />
She is now considering legal action against the Met.<br />
<br />
A Met spokeswoman said: &quot;The nature and scale of corruption within the MPS in the 1990s was recognised at the time as entirely unacceptable. <br />
<br />
&quot;The fight against corruption was carried out with determination, vigour and innovation. <br />
<br />
&quot;The result was a number of corrupt police officers went to prison or were sacked from the MPS.&quot;<br />
<br />
She added: &quot;We have already accepted that historically the Met did not keep good records of what was retained or destroyed. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are determined to ensure that records are now fit for purpose.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Met said it was confident it held intelligence on the officers named in the reports.<br />
<br />
The spokeswoman added: &quot;It must be deeply disturbing to hear from the media, nearly 20 years on, you were the intended target of a kidnap plot.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the modern day MPS, victim care is of the utmost importance.&quot;<br />
