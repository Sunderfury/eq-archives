Stop getting so angry - I only mentioned the wall as another example of quest lines that don't go anywhere, not becaue they are full of mystery to be unveiled later, but just because they forgot about them. Hell, the fact theres so few is something to be admired on their part given how many quests there are in the game. It's just unfortunate that lore whores like ourselves always remember them.. :)</div>

You ended up in the Violet Tower to try to save him, and then boom, he mumble something about how nice to be free and thats it. No quest reward, he just stood there, didn't even try to walk out or anything. So anti-climatic after such a long chain quest.</div>

No, I'm not<br />
<br />
The questline for the greyman wall should finish - the resolutions on the horde side are just plain strange and missing. Metzen admitted it was an area they had forgotten about at Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
What I'm saying is that this is another example of a quest line series that should be resolved, was forgotten in the initial few passes, and probably never will be for exactly the same reasons as the Karazhan line. <br />
<br />
I dunno why you're gunning so madly for me on this one - they messed up the Scythe of Elune line, it's <b>really</b> obvious that it was suppossed to end with Arugal, and it's just another missing storyline. But you can't have quest lines that jump from level 20 to level 70 or whatever we're at at the time - the majority of people will have forgotten them, never done them, and fixing them really doesn't seem worth the effort. They managed to tie up the missing troll tablets line because it works for both factions in the game, it was an easy tie in and it was already done by characters at the maximum level. How on earth would they fix the mess that is Arugal &amp; The Scythe of Elune?</div>

No, it's not. JFC, you are told to go kill a guy at the Greymane Wall to get vengeance for a murdered spouse and some other stuff. It's just a location for other quest lines, not a destination.<br />
<br />
It's not GOING to be a destination until they open up Gilneas some day, which I wouldn't expect to happen until there's a sea-based expansion, when it could be a new Horde area and counterpart to Kul Tiras.<br />

There are missing quest lines. It's the nature of players to notice them - especially us types on this message board. That's one of the reasons we post here. But in the greater scheme of things, as much as it would be nice to see all these things tied up, it doesn't make sense for Blizzard to go back and spend time fixing that stuff when there's more important issues to hand. Add on top of that the fact that the scythe / arugal line was clearly messed up after a design decision was taken not to push alliance players into Shadowfang Keep, and it's not a pretty picture. <br />
<br />
I would love for them to be finished off, and explain how Arugal got the scythe. But it aint happening because it would take some serious ret-conning one way or the other, and I think they would prefer to leave it as one of the &quot;mysteries&quot; of the game. who knows, maybe it's intended - perhaps they didn't think everyone would focus on the Karazhan aspect of that ending, and it's suppossed to be a quest that you experiance through plying both factions? (say you play an alliance character, do all the quest lines, and the scythe vanishes at the end of it with no resolution. You then play a horde character, encounter everything in silverpine and the worgen, and learn about Arugal and him - then the quest lines make sense. It's only the very last bit of the alliance quest line that doesn't tie them up. Maybe them &quot;fixing&quot; this questline woudl just be to change the end text of that line).</div>
