I almost hate to spoil it, but it's like Katamari Damacy. Except with a goat. It's hilarious. This is the kind of game you give to a friend as a prank, only to find them still playing it hours later.<br />
<br />
And what's more, the trailer is brilliant. Game of the Year. Game of Every Year. Game of Forever.<br />

It's parodying the much hyped Dead Island trailer, which was probably solely responsible for that game being put on the map, so to speak.<br />

For a little background, this was originally just a silly little prototype made during a &quot;game jam&quot;, an event where devs put together working but unmarketable games in a short amount of time as a sort of outlet for creativity. But it was so popular and people begged for more for so long that the developers relented and made a full product out of it. I think it retails for $10. Launches on Steam April 1st. <br />
<br />
I only know about this because The Yogscast has been doing videos on it. I remember seeing it a few times before but always ignored it. The videos are hilarious, but if you want to play the game yourself you probably shouldn't watch them, as this is one of those games where the joy of discovery is what's fun about it. It will get boring once you have seen everything.<br />
<br />
Here's a link to the first video for anyone who wants to see more but doesn't actually want to play it:<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I hope you enjoyed March, because things are going to get quiet for awhile. Each month will at least have one big game, but don't expect the volume of March.<br />
<br />
I guess the biggest game this month is <b>The Elder Scrolls Online</b>, which says a lot about this month. With so few other games to choose from, will people hold steadfast in their determination not to play it, or will people get curious and end up giving it a shot? Also big this month is the PC version of <b>Dark Souls II</b>, if it actually comes out. I haven't seen clear confirmation that it's going to be released on schedule. Will it keep the advanced lightning techniques seen in the pre-release demos, or will it suffer the same downgraded visual state as the PS3 and 360 versions?<br />
<br />
<b>Child of Light</b>, the storybook rpg that I have been hyping lately is due this month, as is the 360 version of <b>Titanfall</b>, <b>Tropico 5</b>, and a few other things that don't really warrant going into further detail on. That's not to say they aren't worth your attention, but that's going to have to be something you decide on yourself. Check the spoiler tag below and see if anything interests you.<br />
<br />
I will say, though, that the Vita is starting to become the system to get if you want weird Japanese (read: anime) shit. The PS3 and 3DS gets that stuff from time to time, but 2014 has had announcement after announcement of these sorts of games for the Vita. I think the ease of accessing digital titles on the system has been a boon for this kind of niche game.<br />
<br />
April gets two: <b>Demon Gaze</b>, which I actually don't know much about as I'm pretty sure it was only announced a couple of weeks ago; and <b>Conception II: Children of the Seven Stars</b> (also for 3DS), a game which has drawn comparison to Persona, except instead of fusing tarot cards together to create demons, you pair up with a girl of your choice and create magical star children who combine to form giant robots. As weird as it sounds, what I've seen of it so far is kind of light as far as jrpg perversion goes, and is mostly just Japanese branded innuendo and jokes. <br />

			Part of the fun of being an Xbox One owner is the social aspect of the console. When deciding who you want to play with, you want to know that your potential opponent is going to play fair, is of the same sort of skill level and is going to behave properly whilst playing. This is something the gamer reputation system helps with, and starting this month it is being updated to make it more useful.<br />
<br />
While most gamers managed to remain in the Green (Good Player) category, there are some who gradually slip. As feedback from other players is received and a player's reputation starts to drop, warnings will be sent out to try to encourage them to change their ways. Microsoft says that these warnings &quot;are based on community feedback collected since Xbox One launched.&quot;<br />
<br />
If things start to get really bad and a player slips right down into the red, Avoid Me, zone, there could start to be penalties. Those who exhibit bad behavior which others complain about could well find that they are unable to take advantage of certain features such as Twitch broadcasting -- so remember to behave from now on!<br />
<br />
The changes should only really affect those users who have been spoiling the experience for everyone else, but in case you are worried that you may have your privileged lowered without good reason, Microsoft offers some reassurance:<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember, we designed the algorithm so it wont penalize you for bad reports over a few weeks of play. The system also adjusts for false reports from people that might intentionally report someone of greater skill or for other griefing purposes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does all of this seem like a good idea to you?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I knew what I was getting into with this, and had decided it could wait, but my curiosity got the best of me and I ended up buying the PS3 digital version on it's midnight launch. I am posting this here instead of in the monthly release thread to serve as a bit of a PSA for anyone who also got bit with the same curiosity bug.<br />
<br />
I find it difficult to place this game. If you read any other gaming forums you might already have some preconceptions on what this is. And I'm going to be honest, the criticisms are more valid than I thought they would be. Most of what you have heard is probably correct. It really sort of is a demo, but it's also much better than almost any demo you will ever play. I don't think it's unfair that they are charging for it, although I do think they are charging too much. Particularly for the PS4/Xone versions. ($20 on PS3/360, $30 for PS4/Xone). <br />
<br />
There is one campaign mission that will take you about two hours to complete. It is not a long mission, but you will spend a lot of that time learning how to play the game, exploring your options, and restarting from a checkpoint if you are trying to play it stealthily. Future playthroughs can probably be done in 30 minutes. There are also 4-5 bonus missions on the same map that also take about 30 minutes. The purpose of these missions is to demonstrate different ways of playing the game. So for example, whether a mission takes place at night or at day makes a big difference. The map is not a large open world, but instead one single large base that lets you approach your objective however you want. It's an impressive step forward for the series, but nothing you haven't seen from other games. <br />
<br />
<br />
The gameplay is very good. While some of the mainline MGS fans complain about certain aspects, I personally think it feels exactly like the successor to Peacewalker should. It controls well, and never really frustrated me. You can mark enemies with your binoculars. If you arouse suspicion, you will get a small light indicator pointing in their direction and the music will get tense. If you get spotted, you will enter slow motion to give you a chance to take them out before they call for help. The latter can be turned off, as purists hate it, but I think with the bigger maps it's kind of necessary. You are generally more exposed than you have been in any other game, and it can be hard to take every angle of sight into account.<br />
<br />
Story wise the game is very unsatisfying. You won't see much more than you saw in the trailers for the game, and the way it is put together doesn't really do anything to make you excited for the Phantom Pain. There are a few moments of intrigue that should fuel speculation, but it isn't the big lead in into the next game that I hoped it would be. Nor does it stand on it's own very well. And while I haven't gotten or listened to them yet, the collectible audio logs are very dark and very depressing. The game is as much about Guantanamo Bay as it is about the fictional antagonists and their conspiracy plots. I figure Kojima is trying to provide a reason for Big Boss to become a villain by introducing him to horror and pain that can't be ignored, but some of this stuff is really f-ed up. Do not want. <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm willing to ignore the fact that they are probably selling this to pay for the development of the rest of the game and be grateful I was giving the chance to play it this early, but if I had to say whether or not someone else should buy it or wait, I would say wait. This feels like something that will be (or should be?) distributed alongside the main game, either as a pre-order promotion, or simply as the prologue of the game. If the gameplay wasn't so smooth I would say it felt like a prototype version, sort of like the opening chapter to Tomb Raider.<br />
<br />
If you preordered the PS3 version, they gave you the PS3 version of Peacewalker with it for free. This is a pretty great deal, and I find it a bit surprising the cheapest version is the one that got offered such a good deal. All you really get for paying $10 extra with the PS4 version is better graphics and a better frame rate. I sort of think the people who bought the PS3/Xone versions probably deserve a discount for the main game when it is released. <br />
<br />
There is also a mobile companion app, which I wasn't able to use because of connection problems with my PS3. It's basically one of those &quot;second screen&quot; apps that got hyped up so much at the last E3. You can view the game map, listing to audio logs, or play some kind of base building minigame which sounds a lot like a feature from Peacewalker.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I just learned about Mega Man 9 the other day (I know, I'm like 6 years out of date).  It's a fantastic idea.  The concept (for other hermits like me) is basically: recreate an 8-bit era game with all the same basic mechanics as Mega Man 2, except with new, creative, challenges.  From all I've read of reviews, the developers absolutely nailed it.  It makes perfect sense to me.  I played Mega Man games up through the SNES era, and while they were still fun and superior in many ways, the basic formula was just too restrictive to keep up with the competition, and Mega Man in the late 90s.  Nostalgia is obviously the big draw, but it's not impossible that even after six 8-bit installments, there's still new content to enjoy.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure that would work with many other NES games.  I think most NES games are best left in the 80s, (Capcom wasn't even able to pull it off twice for Mega Man).  There are enough indie developers capable putting an innovative twist on side-scrollers that we certainly don't need to bring back Contra or TMNT1, or even, I'd argue: Metroid, though I'm sure others might disagree on that one.  Certainly there seems to be little point in trying to re-create the 8-bit jRPG experience.  New levels for the original Super Mario Bros 1 could be interesting, but most likely anyone who would play that are already playing hacked ROMs.  In general I think if you're going to mine the 80s for videogame ideas, you'll be best off adapting them to a modern style.  But there's one NES game that is truly unique.  One that's never been surpassed, probably <i>cannot</i> be surpassed with modern gameplay expectations, and that I think people WOULD play if the style and presentation was recreated accurately enough and the content was superlative.<br />
<br />
Obviously, that game is: <b>The Legend of Zelda</b>.  I mean the original, the one with the shiny gold cartridge.  It's the one with the grid-based overworld map, the room-based labyrinths, the economy of tiles, the spare feeling that Link is alone in his quest with maybe only a little help from cryptic characters with dialogue measured in the 10s of characters; the raw challenge of the enemy rooms, the devious puzzles, the paucity of in-game hints.  I think it could be phenomenal: a game with (nearly) strict NES-style mechanics adhering to the era's conventions, but with new traps, new puzzles, new enemies, new items, and new twists on old ideas.</div>

I'm a big fan of shooters.  The Call of Duty series in particular has always been a favorite, but probably not for reasons a lot of people consider.  I enjoy it because I can get home, sit down, play for 10 minutes and log out, make myself some dinner, come back watch some TV, play Titanfall for a few more minutes, and then do something else.  If you sit down for most games, you have to sit down, uninterrupted for at least 30 minutes. But I love it because the engine is so seamless.<br />
<br />
<b>On Engines and Netcode</b><br />
<br />
The only game with an equally smooth engine up until now has been Halo, and other than Reach, I've never been a big fan of the Halo games (just an actual gameplay problem, but I fucking love the matchmaking and engine itself).  <br />
<br />
All games have delays caused by the following:<br />
Your reaction time<br />
Latency<br />
Video Delay<br />
<br />
However, other games introduce a lot of additional delays: in Battlefield, if someone shoots you with 1 bullet, the server won't send that bullet to you until either a certain period of time has passed, or it has enough data in a packet to send to you.  So what you'll see is that you instantly die, because it sent 2-3 bullets at once.  To get around this a bit, they limit how fast bullets can hit you, but if you have 2 people shooting at you...  Then there is some nonsensical registration delay in Battlefield.  If I shoot you, my screen will show you get hit, but your screen will show you get hit up to 140ms(+network delay) later.  The fucked up part about this is that hackers (not cheaters) have checked the memory space, and noted that your system actually knows it was hit immediately.  But it doesn't show you get hit until after the delay.<br />
<br />
Halo and early Call of Duty games never really had those problems.  Their updates usually happen as fast as latency allows.  It means when you play, you generally have a pretty fair estimation of whats happening on the screen as fast as possible.  Since the original team left to join Respawn (Titanfall), the netcode has had a large number of problems.  Testing seems to show that they don't understand how latency works.  The original COD games used an engine that gave &quot;host advantage.&quot;  It meant the lower your latency, the more of an advantage you had against anyone else.  After the team split, they started trying to do more and more punishment systems to reduce the Host Advantage, but they're idiots. Testing shows that they punished based on ping, rather than 1-way traffic.  Halo and Battlefield take care of this by just allowing you to kill each other.  That works great in Halo, but in BF,due to the previously mentioned problems and bullet travel time, it means you constantly kill each other.  Which can be significantly more punishing than a 10-20ms advantage.<br />
<br />
Source Engine games are pretty wonky.  They have a lot of look advantage issues, which is generally only a problem in Counter-Strike (where 1 shot from most weapons can kill you).  But in general their netcode is just &quot;okay.&quot;  It's better than Battlefield, but not as good as Halo or the early CoD games.<br />
<br />
It's too early to tell for sure, because weapon balance in games can do a lot to counter these problems, but the Titanfall seems to blow CoD out of the water, and performs roughly equal to Halo.  The engine runs the Source Engine, but they use custom netcode.  And then it uses dedicated servers, which removes the Host Advantage problem.<br />
<br />
<b>Gameplay Mechanics</b><br />
<br />
Now, there are lots of things I don't like about the Call of Duty series: I hate instant knifes that kill you even while you're busy shooting someone in the face, I hate the way the lobby system works (or doesn't).  Titanfall doesn't fix either of those things.  Sure, you kick people instead of knifing them, but it's really the same thing.  I wish I could say that they implemented Halos Lobby system, and made bullets slow down the kick or something, but I can't.  This is one of my few complaints about the game.  In Battlefield, I hate how wonky knifing someone can be.  If you're on different objects with slightly different elevation, often the knife won't work.  Titanfall has two modes: Jump Kick, and Execution.  Execution is basically the Battlefield &quot;I snuck up behind you, so now you're dead&quot; option, but it works more seamlessly. If your positioning is weird, your character leans at the waist or whatever needs to happen to complete the animation.  Jump Kick is more for &quot;I'm charging at you and am out of bullets, so here's a boot to the face&quot;  It makes sense, but it's the one situation where they can have a severe latency advantage.  Due to Jump Kick, and their netcode, it gives the attacker a small edge.  <br />
<br />
But I don't consider this a problem.  Titanfall is all about fast movement. It's the game we all wanted Brink to be, but wasn't.  It's a game about fast movement.  The better you are at the game, the more likely you're chaining together wall runs, and getting faster.  There are areas where a normal double jump will have you hanging on the edge of a 2nd floor window sill to get in, but if you wall run up to the point where you would make that jump you're moving so much faster that you can double jump <i>into</i> the 3rd floor window.  This means that the more skilled you are, the more mobile you are.  This makes gun battles awesome.  You will find yourself tracking people bouncing off of walls, trying to hit them before they get away, or you'll be flying through the air and suddenly get hit. Since you're moving so fast, you likely don't have a chance to locate the shooter, and you just alter your trajectory, trying to get to safety before you try running into them.<br />
<br />
This makes snipers an interesting class to play.  Sniping is completely possible, although more doable on some game-types than others.  And quick scoping is a skill maneuver.  They haven't done any ridiculous targeting mechanics, if you're sniping, the shots are completely reliant on skill.  In COD, if you were sniping, you could &quot;quick scope&quot; and it would auto-target snap to a nearby target for you.  This could allow people to shoot you at 90 degree angles to where they were facing (drag scoping).  Using the scope in Titanfall doesn't provide any auto-targetting.  That makes it difficult to hit a target sometimes, but it didn't feel outrageous.  And you don't have to worry about any bullshit like the newer Call of Duty games were you scope in, and the bullet doesn't go where you're aiming for 250+ms (I'd be fine if it went close to where you're aiming, but when you miss someone 10 feet away when their entire body fills the scope, it's crazy).<br />
<br />
I'm not good enough with sniping to judge the quality of sniping in this game.  I'll update next week after my brother gets home and has some time to test it (his reaction times have been tested to be in the top 0.2%, which would put him in the top 5% for fighter pilots, so his sniping is usually crazy).<br />
<br />
<b>Campaign</b><br />
<br />
What? Campaign? I thought this game was multi-player only!<br />
<br />
It is.  This is the weakest part of the game.  It's a unique idea, and very interesting, but there is an immediate problem.<br />
<br />
So there are 15 levels in the game, and the Campaign has each level introduced with a cut scene explaining why you're there, and what your objective is.  6v6 maps, where it preferentially places players who have played the level as IMC completely onto the Militia team.  Since the game has been out awhile, this probably isn't a big deal to find people playing, but once it's been out for longer, it might be difficult to finish the campaign.  You need to play the Campaign to unlock the other Titans (Ogre and Stryder).  There is no real bonus for winning or losing any of the maps, BUT, since you play through the IMC first, then play through as the Militia, the Militia tend to have significantly more experienced players.  This means you play though the entire campaign, and likely lose 15 matches in a row.  Several games I played as IMC would be me and 5 players with single digit levels.  On normal games, I'm about 3:2 win ratio.  As IMC, I was 1:15.  Not a great way to start the game, so I suggest jumping straight into Classic and waiting until you have a friend to do campaign with.<br />
<br />
<b>Multiplayer &amp; NPC's</b><br />
<br />
I see a lot of complaints about NPC's from people that either haven't played, or are playing it like it's CoD.  The latter players are pretty easy to spot, because they're trying to camp, or stalking around with ADS up.<br />
<br />
You play a Pilot.  You have cybernetic implants, and bad ass armor.  You can take 3x as much damage as the normal NPC's.  You have a few possible upgrades, such as a Cloak (like Predator) or <br />
<br />
There are multiple NPC's in the game: Grunts, Spectres, and Auto-Titans.  If you're not in your Titan while deployed, it will behave as an NPC, and either guard its current area or follow you around (you can switch its orders).  Spectres are interesting, they do more damage than Grunts, bur there are fewer of them.  And you can run up on enemy spectres, and hack them.  Hacked Spectres have an AI upgrade, and will follow you around, watching your back.  Having an NPC watch doors for you is awesome.  <br />
<br />
None of the NPC's in the game can see Cloaked Pilots, but if they take a bullet, their cloak will flicker, and I've been kicked to death by a Grunt once while in combat with an enemy pilot and cloaked.  Death from NPC's is embarrassing.<br />
<br />
The best part of the NPC's is that most of your weapon upgrades happen from PC-&gt;NPC interaction.  Need a new scope?  Kill 100 Grunts.  That's way easier than trying to progress in strictly PvP games.  Some of the challenges required in CoD games would drive me insane.  You'd get into game after game against a team, and not be able to make progress on your challenges.<br />
<br />
Titanfall makes everyone feel like a bad ass.  After the round finishes, the game transitions to a 1 life remaining for all players, and an evac ship marker shows up on the map.  If the losing team can get to that point and evacuate, those who survive get a lot of extra points (300-600), but even if you don't make it, in the rush for their team to stop the evacuation, you can often take out an enemy titan, jumping on top and filling the computer full of bullets (this is called rodeoing in the game).  This means that largely in this game, even losing can remain fun.  <br />
<br />
<b>So... Many... Words...</b><br />
<br />
This game is fun. If you like Action-based FPS games, you'll love this.  If you just feel like you're terrible at FPS games, and that feeling prevents you from playing, you should still give it a try.  I haven't enjoyed a FPS this much since the COD4:Modern Warfare.</div>
