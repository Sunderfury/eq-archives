<b>Daisea </b>is not here a lot in the past year to year and a half<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>But since I haven't shared anything in a few years I thought I'd nattik a few of the pronking pronks that I've recorded.  Note to anyone who doesn't read anything in order and just goes clicking on all the links, the first link in this post is to a song composed a couple hundred years ago. <br />
<br />
My most recent and unfinished project is a series of variations on Mozart's famous piano sonata <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NNvsYhuErk" target="_blank">K.545</a> (seriously that is the best performace I could find on YouTube because everyone seems to have uploaded their kid's junior high recital...)<br />
<br />
Anyway here is the partial recording: <a href="http://www.goladus.com/music/k545vars1_2.mp3" target="_blank">Variations on a Mozart's Sonata in C Major K. 545, for two pianos</a><br />
<br />
===<br />
<a href="http://www.goladus.com/music/Treasure.mp3" target="_blank">Treasure</a><br />
<br />
The next one I wrote after listening to a lot of Beethoven.<br />
<br />
I tried to write a singable melody into this one in case I ever wanted to make it a song.  The most consistent complaint I get about my music is that people &quot;don't like instrumental music&quot;  So anyway it seems to me like a sentimental love song.  The melody (that would be sung) is the acoustic guitar part.<br />
<br />
===<br />
<a href="http://www.goladus.com/music/NobleSac.mp3" target="_blank">Noble Sacrifice</a><br />
<br />
If any of you remember the Vanguard forums there were pretty chock full of annoying fanboys.  You could show them a little drop of poo and they would go on about how amazed they were that it was such a perfect little poo.  They absolutely adored Todd Masten, who sometimes seemed to be singlehandedly putting the game together (which may not have been far from the truth).  One aspect that received tons of praise was the soundtrack clips, along with the claim that there was a ridonkulous amount of music in the game.<br />
<br />
When I listened to the music, that number was still impressive, but not nearly as much as I thought.  Most of Vanguard's music seemed to be composed with a bunch of fancy and probably expensive looping tools and instrument sounds, where each little theme is repeated tons of times verbatim and then each track is mix and matched randomly for 10 minutes, with little melody snippets thrown in here or there.  My reaction was basically &quot;Meander for 10 minutes? I can do <i>that</i>&quot; (though I didn't have the fancy sound tools and libraries Masten did).  So I took 24 hours and came up with <a href="http://www.goladus.com/music/NobleSac.mp3" target="_blank">this</a>.  Oddly enough, it seems to be the most popular thing I've written.  <br />
<br />
(btw again I don't really mean to bash Todd Masten, he is a far more successful musician than I am.  I just think his Music tends to be compositionally boring.)<br />
<br />
===<br />
<u>2 Pieces in 7-8 time</u><br />
<br />
Shortly after that, I wrote a couple of other little pieces again with the idea of &quot;see how fast I can churn something out&quot; and came up with something <a href="http://www.goladus.com/music/alittlegoofy.mp3" target="_blank">a little goofy</a> and something <a href="http://www.goladus.com/music/alittlelessgoofy.mp3" target="_blank">a little less goofy</a>.  The second one I probably can't publish-- not too sure if it counts as fair use or not but there's a rather blatant stolen melody about halfway through.  (it was extremely famous in 1992).<br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
I've also got some older piano music, a bunch of half-written stuff and drunken piano ramblings but don't plan on sharing them :)</div>

				Im a cheesecake aficionado, but Ive had great difficulty finding really good cheesecake in restaurants and bakeries. American cheesecake  even the famed New York variety  is usually much too heavy and sticky for me.<br />
<br />
Worst of all is the uncooked, unpalatable gummy mess made with gelatin and/or graham cracker crumbs served by too many restaurants. I maintain that it should be at least a misdemeanor  perhaps, even, a felony  to offer that garbage as cheesecake.<br />
<br />
The cheesecake in Israel, however, is magnificent! Its both light and moist, and it has a delicate flavor of rich cream cheese, with slight vanilla-lemon overtones.<br />
<br />
The best cheesecake of all is served at the Tel Aviv Hilton. After much cajoling, I managed to obtain the actual recipe from the hotels food and beverage manager, a man named Moshe Dayan (no relation to the famed Israel Defense Forces general of the same name who wore an eye patch).<br />
<br />
I should have known. As given to me, the recipe was not at all suitable for home use. It required 90 eggs and made 18 cheesecakes.<br />
<br />
Other quantities were in the metric system. The dry ingredients needed to be weighed, instead of measured. Even the baking temperatures were in degrees Celsius!<br />
<br />
Thanks to the help of a restaurant-quality scale and my computer, I cut the recipe down to a more manageable size and converted the liters and kilograms into cups and tablespoons.<br />
<br />
But that didnt quite work, as Israeli cream cheese is somewhat different from that available in the United States.<br />
<br />
With a little experimentation, however, several cheesecakes later I concocted a mixture of cheeses and sour cream that very closely approximated Israeli cream cheese.<br />
<br />
The result? A wonderful cheesecake  every bit as good as the cheesecake served at the Tel Aviv Hilton. Its easy to bake and always gets lots of compliments from my guests. Enjoy!<br />
<blockquote><u><b>Cheesecake</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
<br />
8 ounces cream cheese<br />
8 ounces farmers or hoop cheese<br />
8 ounces sour cream<br />
5 eggs (separated)<br />
3 tablespoons granulated sugar, plus 3/4 cup sugar  see below)<br />
4 tablespoons flour<br />
4 tablespoons corn starch<br />
1 cup milk<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla<br />
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract<br />
thin slices of sponge cake or pound cake to use as a base<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
<br />
Mix all of the above  except the egg whites, three-quarters of a cup of sugar and the sponge or pound cake  until its smooth and free of lumps.<br />
<br />
Beat the egg whites until theyre stiff, slowly adding the three-quarters of a cup of sugar as the egg whites rise.<br />
<br />
Fold the egg whites-sugar mixture into the batter by hand.<br />
<br />
Line the bottom of a 9 1/2-inch spring-form cake pan with a thin layer of sponge cake or pound cake.<br />
<br />
Pour the batter into the pan.<br />
<br />
Bake at 475 degrees until the top turns light brown, about 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Remove from the oven and run a knife around the edge of the pan. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.<br />
<br />
Return the cake to the oven and bake for an additional 45 to 50 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.<br />
<br />
Cool on a wire rack. When its cool, remove the sides (vertical part) of the spring-form pan.<br />
<br />
Dust the top of the cake with powdered sugar, if desired. Or, serve with a topping of a berry sauce.<br />
<br />
The cake should be refrigerated if not eaten immediately.  </blockquote><blockquote><b><u>Pie crust</u></b><br />
<br />
Heres a time-saving twist: Instead of first making a sponge cake or pound cake, mix a batch of Lemon Butter Cookie dough (recipe below).<br />
<br />
Spread about half of the dough on the bottom of the spring-form cake pan (sides removed), about one-quarter-inch thick.<br />
<br />
Bake at 400 degrees for seven minutes, or until its a golden brown. Make lemon butter cookies with the remaining dough.<br />
<br />
When the lemon cookie crust has cooled, use a small knife to trim any of the cookie dough that might have spread over the rim of the cake pan bottom.<br />
<br />
Assemble the spring-form cake pan and fill it with the cheesecake batter.<br />
<br />
Bake as indicated above.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Ingredients</b><br />
<br />
1 cup all-purpose flour<br />
1 stick (1/2 cup) sweet butter, softened<br />
1/2 cup granulated sugar<br />
1 egg<br />
zest of one lemon (about 1 teaspoon)<br />
1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />
1/4 teaspoon salt<br />
1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br />
1/2 teaspoon lemon extract<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Directions</b><br />
<br />
In an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar. Add and combine all of the other ingredients, the flour last.<br />
<br />
Drop by teaspoons onto a cookie sheet lined with aluminum foil, about 2 inches apart.<br />
<br />
Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes or until theyre a light, golden brown.<br />
<br />
Note: Zest is the flavorful outermost part of the rind of a citrus fruit. To remove the zest, you can use the finest holes of a grater. But if you use a grater, you need to take care not to include any of the bitter white pith called rag that lies just beneath the zest.<br />
<br />
A lemon zester is very efficient. It removes only the outer zest and the fragrant oils. Some zesters resemble a rasp. Others look like a very specialized (and exceedingly sharp!) grater.<br />
<br />
Neither type is very expensive. A zester is a good investment for your kitchen if you use zest frequently in your cooking.<br />
<br />
In a pinch, you can remove the zest of a lemon or other citrus fruit with a vegetable peeler, then finely dice it with a small utility knife.   </blockquote>

GRAND JUNCTION &#8212; At this time of year temperatures in the southern Arizona Sonoran Desert reach well into the hundreds. And each year hundreds of immigrants die of thirst or heat exhaustion while attempting to cross this land of Saguaro cacti seeking a home or work in the United States.<br />
<br />
    Two Grand Junction men are joining 65 other Americans who will deliver &#8220;comfort packages&#8221; and walk 75 miles through the desert in solidarity with those who&#8217;ve lost their lives while traveling across the southwest desert after illegally crossing the border.<br />
<br />
    Tom Acker, a Mesa State College Spanish professor, and Elijah Johnson, who is conducting independent border studies with the college&#8217;s Spanish department, are traveling to Tucson, Ariz., to take part in the fifth annual Migrant Trail: We Walk for Life. <br />
<br />
    &#8220;We&#8217;re collecting materials for small care packages for people who find themselves lost in the desert,&#8221; Acker said.<br />
<br />
    Comfort items include things like sports drinks, granola bars, socks, first aid supplies and personal hygiene products such as toothbrushes and shampoo. <br />
<br />
    Acker and Johnson will give the care packages to one of the many organizations sponsoring the event, such as Humane Borders, Coloradans for Immigrants Rights and American Friends Service Committee in Tucson, whose members will then plant the packages or simply carry them into the desert to give to refugees encountered along the way.<br />
<br />
    Although Americans are not allowed to transport an undocumented immigrant (unless it&#8217;s a life or death situation) people are permitted to make humanitarian gestures like providing food and water to those in need.<br />
<br />
    The Migrant Trail walk begins May 26, with a sending-off ceremony in Sasabe, Sonora, Mexico, from where 67 people will walk 5 miles to the first campsite in the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge. The group will camp for six days, arriving in Tucson June 1.<br />
<br />
    It&#8217;s more of a symbolic journey than trying to feel what it&#8217;s like to be an immigrant walking through the desert, Acker said. It&#8217;s more of a demonstration of immigration laws that contribute to the deaths of hundreds of people a year, he added.<br />
<br />
    Acker attended the walk for the first time in 2007 with his son Dante, who was 15 at the time. A group of high school students from Pennsylvania, two Franciscan monks, a pastor and another professor were among those who walked last year. <br />
<br />
    &#8220;One of the weird, surreal things I saw was the investment the U.S. government makes in surveillance equipment, towers, infrared cameras, antennas, watch points. It&#8217;s a militarized border,&#8221; Acker said. &#8220;Helicopters are flying over. It reminded me of one of the battle scenes from &#8216;Star Wars.&#8217;&#8221; <br />
<br />
    People may donate individual items or make up the comfort packages themselves by placing seven items into a one-gallon plastic bag. Donations will be collected at the Global Heart Spiritual Center, 1622 Glenwood Ave., during office hours Monday, Tuesday, Thursday or Friday from noon to 4 p.m. Or call Grand Valley Peace and Justice at 243-0209.

Ed Ableser, a state representative from Tempe/Scottsdale, is standing in the desert somewhere southeast of Three Points, a towel slung over his shoulder, a head lamp strapped to his forehead and a toothbrush clutched in his hand. <br />
<br />
Dusk is fast gathering over the lowslung mountains behind him, and he's ready to slide into his sleeping bag. He's tired--and no wonder. This morning, Ableser walked 16 miles through the desert as part of the fourth annual Migrant Trail, a weeklong trek meant to call attention to the deaths of border crossers in the desert. The temperature reached a hot 97. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is an opportunity to walk in memory, celebration and awareness of the people who have lost their lives in trying to better their lives,&quot; Ableser says, delivering a well-crafted sound bite despite his fatigue. &quot;I've been taken care of here,&quot; he adds. &quot;I can't imagine what it's like for someone just walking with a 2-liter bottle of water.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ableser intends to recount his pilgrimage to his colleagues in the state house up in Phoenix, but he's just one of 40 to 50 walkers making the seven-day trek. Hailing from Pennsylvania, Virginia, Texas, Colorado, California and Oregon, as well as Arizona, many of his fellow participants are religious--two Franciscan friars are marching in long, brown robes--and conceive of the trip in religious terms. <br />
<br />
&quot;As a Christian, I'm called to be a welcomer who makes a place for the immigrant,&quot; says Dan Abbott, a retired social worker and Presbyterian from Tempe who's pitched his tent near Albeser's. &quot;It's a spiritual journey, too. The desert is a theme running through the scriptures.&quot; <br />
<br />
Friar Martín Ibarra says he himself crossed the border illegally back in 1989, when it was less dangerous. Now, as a Franciscan, he follows the &quot;charism&quot;--or religious mandate--of his order. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are on the side of the poor, the marginalized, the broken,&quot; he says, taking a rest after what he calls &quot;four very long days.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That's who we are. I march in solidarity with my brothers and sisters crossing the border.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ibarra, Abbott and the rest are traipsing the 75 miles from the border town of Sasabe to Tucson, a major route for migrants who've illegally crossed into the United States. (The group departed on Memorial Day, May 28, and arrived in Tucson on Sunday, June 3.) The walk is timed, says Jodi Read, a walker who works with the West Coast Mennonite Central Committee, to coincide with the &quot;beginning of the death season.&quot; <br />
<br />
So far this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, known migrant deaths number in the high 80s, but the toll typically skyrockets during the 100-degree days of summer. <br />
<br />
Each walker wears a white cross emblazoned with the name and age of a dead migrant. (Ableser's is Mario Castillo Fernandez, age 26.) The walkers believe they can raise people's consciousness about the deaths, even if their trek is not heavily covered in the media. The can bring their stories back to their far-flung communities. <br />
<br />
Lani Jo Leigh, a filmmaker and writer from Portland, Ore., is an &quot;avid walker&quot; who began walking marathons at the age of 50. She touches the cross on her chest--painted with the name of the late Margarita Guerra Escalera, age 44--and says she'll tell her Episcopal church back home what she's learned. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can take it back to my own community,&quot; she says. &quot;In Portland, we don't know it the same way they do on the borderlands.&quot; <br />
<br />
But at a time when the volume of angry discussion of illegal immigration is turned way up, the walkers want to do more than bring attention to the desert deaths. They want conditions to change, explains Tucson's Guadalupe Castillo, as she sits in a folding lawn chair after dinner. Co-chair of Coalición de Derechos Humanos, Castillo drives a support van for the Migrant Trail each year. <br />
<br />
&quot;We need to change this broken policy that has brought us down this dark path of death,&quot; she says. &quot;We promised ourselves we would march until the deaths ended.&quot; <br />
<br />
I've caught up with the travelers at their camp on the fourth day and longest leg of their journey. Most days, they rack up 10 or 12 miles, but on day four (Thursday, May 31), they started out at 4 a.m. in the rough terrain of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge and ended 16 miles later on the side of Route 286 by noon. A caravan of vehicles follows along, carrying camping gear, food, water, medical supplies and even portable toilets. Church groups drive out with meals every lunch and dinnertime. <br />
<br />
Tonight, the group is camped at Caballo Loco Ranch, a scenic RV park 8 bumpy dirt miles east of the highway. To the walkers' delight, the Caballo is equipped with hot showers and flush toilets. <br />
<br />
As the sun sets over the camp, ringed by small mountains and dotted with just a few trailers in the hills, the walkers are at their leisure. Two men are playing guitars, and Leigh, the Portland filmmaker, is singing &quot;I'm on My Way to Freedom Land&quot; in a clear and lovely soprano. <br />
<br />
Nearly everybody's brought along a folding camp chair, and they've freed their weary feet from their heavy walking shoes. They're wiggling their toes in the air, on orders of the trek nurse, Jessica Sanchez, of Denver. <br />
<br />
To prevent blisters, &quot;We have them wear flip-flops in the evening,&quot; Sanchez says. &quot;And clean socks every day.&quot; <br />
<br />
The walkers don't begin to pretend that their journey, backed up by the support team, is as difficult or as dangerous as the hikes migrants take every day. They don't have to carry water. They don't have to hide from the Border Patrol. They can get a ride home if they feel ill. <br />
<br />
&quot;To be cared for is incredibly nurturing,&quot; says Delle McCormick, executive director of Tucson's BorderLinks group, speaking in her comfy folding camp chair after the evening meal, cooked up by volunteers at a church in Green Valley. &quot;It's nothing like what the migrants go through.&quot; <br />
<br />
The migrants have to worry about desert perils--dehydration, snake bites, cactus spines--as well as the Border Patrol, Abbott points out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Early this morning, a Border Patrol helicopter shone a light on us,&quot; Abbott says, &quot;I didn't feel at risk,&quot; as the migrants would. &quot;Five minutes before that, somebody saw a rattlesnake. For the migrants, there's a danger to be had from the physical environment and danger from the Border Patrol.&quot; <br />
<br />
Still, the Migrant Trail walk is tough, and it's hot. Carrie Fox, a Presbyterian church volunteer and BorderLinks staffer, displays the multiple bandages wrapped around her feet. <br />
<br />
&quot;My feet are a sad story,&quot; she says. &quot;I have a lot of blisters--a total count of 18.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sanchez says she had to send a woman home to Green Valley a few days before. The woman felt weak and dehydrated and, despite a little TLC, didn't get better. The group leaders are not about to risk anyone's health or life, Sanchez says. <br />
<br />
And the nights can be tough, too. Ableser kindly gets me a tarp on which to lay my sleeping bag, and he directs me away from a fierce red-ant colony. But even a camping pad can't make the ground soft, or less rocky. The nearly full moon is beautiful, but its slow, bright journey from east to west over the course of the night chases off sleep. Coyotes howl periodically. And around 3 a.m., the temperatures turn cold enough to make me shiver in my sleeping bag. <br />
<br />
Reveille is at 4:30 a.m., in the dark chill. &quot;Good morning, buenos días,&quot; an early bird calls out as he circles the camp. &quot;Time to get up.&quot; <br />
<br />
Breakfast and coffee are still an hour and a half away. Under the watchful eyes of a half-dozen curious deer on the ridge, the walkers crawl out into the chill, collapse their tents, pile their gear into the trucks and fan out to pick up stray bits of trash. <br />
<br />
Then everyone piles into trucks for the bumpy ride back to the road. I sit next to Francisco Avalos, a cheerful Californian recently transplanted to Tucson. He's stowed a little beef jerky into his pack, he says, as a small counterweight to the week's veggie menus. &quot;The first thing I'm going to do when I get back is have a steak dinner,&quot; he declares. <br />
<br />
The name on Avalos' cross is desconocido, unknown/stranger, to represent the many desert dead who are never identified. <br />
<br />
&quot;My parents were immigrants,&quot; he says. &quot;My goal is to better understand my parents, and to become a better person.&quot; <br />
<br />
At the roadside, the walkers gobble down bean burritos left over from last night, and swill coffee before doing stretching exercises. Then they recite a prayer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Loving Creator, have pity on my migrant brothers and sisters,&quot; they intone. &quot;Make them be respected and valued for their dignity.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then, at 7 a.m. precisely, they line up single-file on the side of the road. The sun has already burned off the morning's chill and turned the day hot. The first in line hoists a big white cross painted with the word Presente (we are here), and off they go at a fast pace, marching toward Three Points and its Serenity Baptist Church, 12 1/2 miles away.   
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
If you wanted to reduce the number of deaths in the desert wouldn't it be better to discourage desert crossers instead of just leaving 'care package' breadcrumbs...</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>My son's PS3 has a problem.  When you turn it on, it beeps 3 times and shuts off.  It's had a game disc stuck in it for a while, but I finally managed to get the machine to eject it today by holding down the eject button while turning the machine on.<br />
<br />
But now it won't accept any discs back in.  No matter how far you push them in, the automatic disc grabber never kicks in.  If you push it all the way in by hand, the system doesn't recognize it.<br />
<br />
But worse than that... shouldn't the machine still boot up without a disc in?  I've heard of people downloading and playing games from the internal hard drive, but I can't even get it to boot up at all.<br />
<br />
My warranty is voided, due to having to open up the case to retrieve a toothpick that got pushed in through the CD slot a few months back.  It has played fine since that time (up until a few days ago), though, so I'm pretty sure I didn't hurt it by opening it up.<br />
<br />
We had a severe electrical storm night before last.  Lightning got our 2 garage door openers, and the router on our home network.  I'm wondering if the lightning might have gotten the PS3 too.<br />
<br />
I've heard that sony won't even look at it if the case has been opened, even if you pay their $150 &quot;out of warranty&quot; fee.  Is there a way I can narrow down the problem myself?</div>
