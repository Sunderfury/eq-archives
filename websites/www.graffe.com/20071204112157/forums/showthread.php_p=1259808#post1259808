EVE Online is a massively multiplayer game where tens of thousands work, compete, play and fight in a dark and dangerous sci-fi world. It's a beautiful place, and is about to become absolutely gorgeous. <br />
5 December marks the deployment date of the EVE: Trinity expansion. This constitutes a massive change in the world of EVE; not only is the expansion packed with new features, but it also includes a graphics update of gargantuan proportions. Every ship, station and stargate has been completely overhauled from start to finish, resulting in an amazing splendor of spacefaring sights. It really has to be seen to be believed, and once Trinity arrives and you log on to EVE, we're convinced that you will never look back. <br />
<br />
Want to take a look? We have two trailers you can preview, a 102M HD1080p <a href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/download/videos/Default.asp?a=download&amp;vid=157" target="_blank">EVE: Trinity Trailer</a> and the smaller 64M HD720p <a href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/download/videos/Default.asp?a=download&amp;vid=156" target="_blank">EVE: Trinity Trailer</a>. <br />
<br />
The main feature of our Trinity expansion is the total overhaul of our visuals, a massive task that took our talented artists and programmers 50 man-years to produce. <br />
<br />
However, this grand conjuration of visual splendor is far from the only thing we're bringing you. Trinity includes a host of improvements that run the gamut from content to gameplay, giving you shiny new ships to play with, hundreds of new and exciting things to do with them, and a range of tweaks and fixes that make EVE even better to play than before. For an overview, visit the <a href="http://www.eve-online.com/trinity/index.html" target="_blank">Trinity Features page</a>. For all the details, read below. <br />
<br />
The complete list of EVE: Trinity Changes and Fixes can be viewed <a href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/updates/patchnotes.asp?patchlogID=155" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />
<br />
New Game Play Features<br />
New Player Experience<br />
Context Help <br />
In most windows, a small question mark ? will be visible in the top right corner. Within, players have access to knowledgebase articles based on the window they are in, or even more detailed depending on the tab, or function they are focused on. <br />
Tip of the day <br />
On the character selection screen, tip of the day has been placed. Filled with general know-how and tidbits that might be common knowledge to some, but breaking news to others. A tip is selected on random from the database and displayed, with options of randomizing again or flipping back and forth. <br />
<br />
New Tutorials <br />
With Trinity arrive 3 new tutorials, each focusing on different features. They will look at Exploration, Heat and salvaging. If you havent tried out said features, the tutorials will help you get started with those and teach you the basics. <br />
<br />
Corporate Registry<br />
With corporate registry, corporations have an easier way to advertise themselves to players in hope of recruiting. Players have an easily accessible database which they can go through to find the corporation of their dreams. <br />
Region wide advertisements, with no limit to number of adverts, <br />
Unlimited search capabilities from region to region, <br />
Increased visibility of all corporations wanting to heighten their corporate profile. <br />
Tech 2 ships<br />
Electronic Attack Ships<br />
The electronic attack ships are essentially frigate equivalents of the combat recons. While they are somewhat lacking in EW capabilities and firepower compared to the combat recons, they should nevertheless not be under estimated. Their frigate class sensors give them first strike capability and enable them to disable enemy ships before they have a chance to lock. With the mobility of frigate hulls they are valuable assets for roaming frigate gangs. <br />
<br />
Sentinel (Amarr) <br />
Kitsune (Caldari) <br />
Keres (Gallente) <br />
Hyena (Minmatar) <br />
Heavy interdictors<br />
Heavy interdictors are cruiser equivalents of the destroyer based interdictors, which combine area of effect warp disruption with the tanking capabilities of Heavy Assault Ships. Rather than using warp disrupt probes, the heavy interdictors use a module, the Warp Disruption Field Generator, which prevents all ships within its range from warping or jumping (including the heavy interdictor itself). While having the warp disruption field generator on a heavily tanked ship makes it more resilient, it also comes with some drawbacks. When activated the warp disruption field generator prevents remote assistance, increases the signature radius of the ship and reduces the effectiveness of afterburners and microwarpdrives. The agility is however effectively increased: the mass of the ship and the thrust of afterburners and microwarpdrives is significantly decreased (the thrust reduction cancels out the mass reductions in terms of speed boost). This effective increase in agility means that heavy interdictors flying at high speeds will slow down very fast once the warp disruption field generator is activated. <br />
<br />
Devoter (Amarr) <br />
Onyx (Caldari) <br />
Phobos (Gallente) <br />
Broadsword (Minmatar) <br />
Black Ops<br />
The Black Ops specialize in infiltration and covert operation. Equipped with a jump drive, they can jump short distances past enemy blockades. Covert Ops, Stealth Bombers and Force Recons (not Combat Recons) have been upgraded to support Covert Cynosural Field Generators. These new modules are advanced Cynosural Field Generators that cannot be detected and only Black Ops can lock on to. What makes the Black Ops in particular dangerous is that they can use miniaturized jump portal generators, Covert Jump Portal Generators, to sneak allied forces behind enemy lines. However the covert jump portal technology is rather limited compared to the Titan class jump portals and require support from the ships that jump through to work correctly. Covert jump portal generators can only bridge for ships with Jump Harmonics 2 or above. The covert tech 2 ships: Covert Ops, Stealth Bombers and Force Recons have been upgraded to this end. The resource consumption on the Black Ops jump drives and the Covert Jump Portal Generator is very high, so jump fuel logistics are a concern. Fortunately the Black Ops can also use ordinary jump gates and can thus save jump fuel for when it really matters. <br />
<br />
Redeemer (Amarr) <br />
Widow (Caldari) <br />
Sin (Gallente) <br />
Panther (Minmatar) <br />
Marauders<br />
Marauders are heavy battleships focusing primarily on attrition and deployment for longer periods of time. While their number of hardpoints is limited to just 4, they also receive a 100% damage bonus to their primary weapon type. This has a number of advantages: the remaining high slots are available for other tasks, weapon capacitor need and munitions consumption rates are also reduced. Featuring large cargo holds they have plenty of storage for capacitor boosters or spoils of war. The sensors have been optimized for locking up to 10 targets at a time, but with sensor strengths comparable to cruisers the Marauders can be jammed quite easily if they are not hardened with ECCM. <br />
<br />
Paladin (Amarr) <br />
Golem (Caldari) <br />
Kronos (Gallente) <br />
Vargur (Minmatar) <br />
Jump Freighters<br />
Jump freighters are the latest generation of freighter. They are based upon their tech one counterparts but with significant enhancements. They are faster and more agile, with a larger capacitor. The main change however, is a large portion of the cargo bay has been taken over by a capital class jump drive, the same type used in carriers, dreadnaughts, motherships and titans. This means that whilst the ship has around one third of the cargo capacity, it is capable of jumping between systems without the use of stargates. These ships still retain the ability to use normal stargates, and can be constructed in high security space. <br />
<br />
Anshar (Gallente) <br />
Ark (Amarr) <br />
Nomad (Minmatar) <br />
Rhea (Caldari) <br />
ARM Scripts<br />
ARM Scripts are non-consumable charges that modify the attributes of the module they are installed in. They are installed/uninstalled just like loading/unloading ammo. The modules that can be scripted are listed below followed by the script names in brackets. <br />
Sensor boosters (Targeting Range and Scan Resolution) <br />
Remote sensor boosters (uses the same ARM scripts as sensor boosters) <br />
Remote sensor dampeners (Targeting Range Dampening and Scan Resolution Dampening) <br />
Tracking computers (Optimal Range and Tracking Speed) <br />
Tracking links (uses the same ARM scripts as tracking computers) <br />
Tracking disruptors (Optimal Range Disruption and Tracking Speed Disruption) <br />
Warp Disruption Field Generators (Focused Warp Disruption) <br />
The scriptable modules have also been modified to accommodate the ARM scripts. In order to get the maximum benefit from e.g. a sensor booster one has to choose between boosting either targeting range or scan resolution. This applies to all the scriptable modules in general (except for the Warp Disruption Field Generator): one can get the same effect as before, but one has to choose between the two bonuses. <br />
Bonuses to the above scriptable modules now apply to percentage bonuses rather than multipliers <br />
Remote sensor dampeners have been reduced in effectiveness <br />
Remote sensor boosters and tracking links have had their effectiveness enhanced <br />
The tracking link bonuses on the Oneiros and the Scimitar have been increased to 10% <br />
Information Warfare Link - Electronic Superiority now has different bonuses to different type of electronic warfare: <br />
ECM and target painters: 2% <br />
Remote sensor dampeners and tracking disruptors: 1.2% <br />
Bandwidth<br />
Drone bandwidth is a new additional constraint on drones which limits the drones that can be deployed. Each ship has an available bandwidth for controlling drones that all deployed drones must share. Every drone has a bandwidth requirement which must be available on the controlling ship when launching the drone. Once launched, the bandwidth required by the drone is reserved for that drone and not available to other drones. Bandwidth is reclaimed once the drone returns to the drone bay or control of the drone is lost. With bandwidth the damage output from drones can be limited while still allowing for spare drones. Drone bandwidth requirements: <br />
light drones: 5Mbit/s <br />
medium drones: 10Mbit/s <br />
heavy drones: 25Mbit/s <br />
Ship bandwidth: <br />
Frigates: 25Mbit/s <br />
Destroyers: 25Mbit/s <br />
Cruisers: 50Mbit/s <br />
Battlecruisers: 75Mbit/s <br />
Battleships: 125Mbit/s <br />
Exceptions for drone ships: <br />
Ishkur: 25Mbit/s bandwidth, 25m3 + 5m3/level drone bay <br />
Vexor: 75Mbit/s bandwidth, 100m3 dronebay <br />
Ishtar: 125Mbit/s bandwidth, no change in dronebay <br />
Arbitrator, Curse, Pilgrim: 50 Mbit/s bandwidth, 150m3 dronebay <br />
Myrmidon: 75Mbit/s bandwidth, 150m3 dronebay <br />
Eos: 75Mbit/s bandwidth, 150m3 + 15m3/level dronebay <br />
Missions, Dungeons and NPCs<br />
Missions are a vital part of EVE's Player versus Environment experience. Over 140 missions are a part of the EVE: Trinity expansion, including new Mining/Harvesting, Mega-courier, New Player Experience, and Story Arcs for Empire and Faction agents. Also part of the expansion are 50 more exploration sites, balance changes, improvements to NPCs and their equipment and other features are being added. <br />
User Interface and EVE Voice<br />
As part of the graphics update, the Player Interfaces have been overhauled and we're not done yet. Many elements of the User Interface are now mobile and EVE Voice is now being integrated further into the UI. More information on these updates can be reviewed in this <a href="http://myeve.eve-online.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&amp;bid=516" target="_blank">Dev Blog</a>. <br />

New implant sets and modules for Mordu's Legion, Thukker Tribe, Syndicate, SSoE and ORE have been created. <br />
Ships <br />
<br />
Sansha mk 2 has been implemented; Sansha faction ships now focus exclusively on energy turrets exclusively and shield tanking. They receive a fixed 100% damage bonus to make up for the few hardpoints they have (which frees up utility high slots), as well as 7.5% tracking and 5% damage bonuses per level. <br />
Carrier ship maintenance bays have been increased by 100%. <br />
The Hel's CPU has been increased to 950tf. <br />
The Nidhoggur now has a new low slot at the expense of a medium slot. <br />
The Eos has been modified as follows: the number of turret slots has been reduced to five, one medium slot has been swapped for a low slot, the drone capacity has been increased to 150m3 and the drone capacity bonus has been reduced to 15m3 per level. <br />
The Ares now has a new medium slot at the expense of a high slot. Also, launcher hard points have been reduced to one. <br />
The following changes have been made to the ORE Rorqual: <br />
The Ship Maintenance bay has been increased from 800,000m3 to 1,000,000m3. <br />

A survey probe explosion delay bonus has been given to the Imicus and removed from the Maulus. <br />
A new role bonus has been added to all interceptors: an 80% reduction in propulsion jamming systems activation cost has been granted. <br />
Ares, Raptor, Malediction and Stiletto interceptors have had their secondary interceptor skill bonus changed from damage/falloff to 5% increase to warp scrambler range per level. <br />
The Rook now has an extra low slot at the cost of a high slot. <br />
The Cap Need MWD bonus effect on the Daredevil, Thorax, Deimos, Vigilant and Vindicator has changed, the effect now adds to the modifier instead of percentage modifying it. <br />
The MWD cap need bonus for the Daredevil, VIgilant and VIndicator has been reduced from 10% per level to 5%. Capacitor capacity has increased by 12.5% <br />
All Battleship volumes have been reduced to 45% of original value. <br />
All Battlecruisers and Command ships have had volume increases of 80%. <br />
All T2 cruisers volumes are now matched to their T1 hull class variants. <br />
Changed displayname of &quot;turretSpeeBonus&quot; (as used by Gunnery and various implants) from &quot;Turret Speed Bonus&quot; to &quot;rate of fire bonus&quot; to bring it in line with &quot;speedMultiplier&quot; (as used on damage mods). <br />
It will no longer be possible to use the cargohold of a ship stored in a ship maintenance array for additional storage. Only charges will be storable. <br />
Modules and Drones <br />
<br />
Offlined modules now function as &quot;heat sinks&quot; when overloading, reducing the chance of the other modules to take heat damage. <br />
Repair costs for modules have been modified as follows: up to 50% of base price if the module is partially damaged and up to 100% of base price if the module is fully damaged. <br />
The position of an overloaded module in the rack now affects the chances of the other modules in the rack to take damage from heat. The further away from the overloaded module they, the smaller the chances are for the other modules to become damaged. <br />
Need for Speed (drones): The rate of fire for all drones has been doubled to decrease the number of server calls drones are making. Drone damage was doubled to balance the RoF change. Sentry drones and fighters are not affected by any of these changes. <br />
The maximum range of Torpedoes has been decreased. <br />
The rate of fire of Siege Missile Launchers has been decreased by 25%. <br />
Bombs now launch with a forward velocity, similar to survey probes. <br />
Tech II remote armor repairers have been balanced and introduced. <br />
The meta level of Selynne's Modified Thermic Plating and Raysere's Modified Thermic Plating have been changed to 12. <br />
The resistance bonuses on tech 2, faction, Mizuro's modified and Gotan's modified resistance platings have been increased. <br />
The capacitor need of ECM modules has been reduced by 40%. <br />
The signature radius penalty on some small shield extenders has been changed to 2m like other modules. <br />
The CPU need of micro shield extenders has been reduced, meta levels corrected and signature radius penalty changed to 1m. <br />
The capacitor capacity penalty on all Capacitor Flux Coils has been reduced by 10%, but the recharge rate bonus has also been decreased to compensate. <br />
The capacitor need of neutralizers has been reduced to improve efficiency, energy destabilization amount and range on small neutralizers has increased, fitting requirements of meta level 1 to 4 small neutralizers have been adjusted to be in line with their larger brethren. <br />
The activation cost of Gang warfare modules has been reduced from 50 to 25. <br />
Meta level 1 to 4 shield boosters now have the same duration as tech 1 shield boosters (meta level 0). Shield boost amount and capacitor need have been adjusted: The efficiency has been increased by +12.5% and the boost rate has been increased up to +12.5% for meta level 0 down to -10% for meta level 4. This ensures that the increase in boost rate and efficiency between tech 1 and tech 2 is in line with the values for armor repairers. <br />
Science and Industry <br />
<br />
Advanced capital construction components have been introduced and are required in the manufacture of Tech II capital ships, they require the same advanced materials as normal construction components. Blueprints for them are seeded on the market available from certain NPC corporations. <br />
When a blueprint can yield more than one type from invention, you can now select the desired outcome from a drop-down menu in the S&amp;I window. <br />
Tech II Remote Armor Repairers can now be invented. <br />
The maximum runs of Tech 2 Hybrid, Laser and Projectile blueprints have been increased from 10 to 100. <br />
Max production run of Barrage M blueprint has been changed from 10 to 100. <br />
The S&amp;I job times of T2 missile blueprints have been reduced to be more inline with equivalent T2 ammo. <br />
The bonuses provided by decryptors in invention have been increased by varying amounts to be more effective in invention jobs. <br />
Bomb manufacturing will output 2 bombs per batch, thus halving their manufacturing costs. <br />
The chance of inventing ship blueprints of smaller Tech II ship classes has been increased leading to a greater chance of success with frigate, destroyer, cruiser and battlecruiser invention. <br />
Skill requirements for making copies of the Expanded Cargohold I Blueprint have been removed. <br />
Invention times for Mining Laser Upgrade I Blueprint and the Ice Harvester Upgrade I Blueprint have been reduced to be in line with other modules. <br />
Changed invention research time on Target Painter I from 120,000 to 9,000 seconds. <br />
Missions, Dungeons &amp; Exploration <br />
<br />
Various dungeons have been adjusted and optimized as part of the Need for Speed initiative. <br />
Scouts report the discovery of six new hidden complexes belonging to the pirate factions. CONCORD has rated two of them as challenging (6/10 on the DED threat assessment scale), while the other four are reported as potentially deadly (9/10 on the DED threat assessment scale) <br />
A few pilots have reported a possible connection between Cosmic Anomalies sites and reputed pirate hidden complexes. These path seems very well hidden and only with great luck can one stumble upon it. <br />
New Metadrones have been introduced, these include two variants of each existing combat drone (not counting sentry drones), for a total of 24. These are faster, stronger and more diverse versions of their T1 and T2 counterparts. <br />
Six new Rogue Drone Components have been introduced and can be looted off Rogue Drone Commanders. These components can be used in remanufacturing regular drones into metadrones with the help of the proper blueprints. <br />
Hacking sites have been introduced in the rogue drone regions; the wrecked remains of old research facilities might just hold information on Rogue Drone command structure. <br />
Hacking sites now appear more frequently in all security levels of space. <br />
More low-sec booster-related exploration sites have been distributed. <br />
An uncompleted exploration site will now despawn during the first downtime after 72 hours have passed since it was first visited. <br />
Multispectral Frequency probes no longer pick up Cosmic Anomalies when the scan is made in the Cosmic Signature category. Note that scanning for Cosmic Anomalies will return results of the Unknown type. <br />
Loyalty Point Store <br />
<br />
New factional offers have been added to appropriate LP stores. <br />
Module and blueprint offers for all Empire faction LP stores have been modified to bring them in line with new pricing models. <br />
Synth Booster BPCs have been added to pirate LP stores. <br />
User Interface and EVE Voice <br />
<br />
The in-space UI has been overhauled. Various components can be moved around the screen and the fleet UI has undergone a re-design. Fleet UI is now accessible while docked at a station. <br />
EVE Voice functionality is now integrated into the fleet UI. <br />

i want you (to join my corp)!<br />
reported by CCP Fear | 2007.11.21 16:48:10 | Comments<br />
It has been a long time since my last, and first, blog but here we are again. Usually I can type endlessly about something that usually turns out to be nothing. Some would think it is a good quality, I however believe it to be... well I honestly don't care. I am going to try to be short (read &quot;yeah right&quot;), but it might end up a bit longer. So I give you, the &quot;Corporate Registry&quot;. Some way to recruit people using game mechanics has been missing for quite some time now. A centralized database where corporations can spill their guts, and more visibly tell the other 200.000 users that they want them to be their next veldspar mining slavegirl is what we're creating. <br />
Up until now, you have relied on the forums and the recruitment channel, a channel that has grown into a monstrosity with an increasing number of players. I have done this before and while it can result in finding a corporation, you usually end up finding a corp through association, or just by stumbling upon it (or you just tried to get into the high profile ones). <br />
<br />
If you already have a corporation, you are all set. Well, almost. You need ISK to use this feature! Yes, this costs money, the DED needs cash for the paperpushing and that will have to come out of your wallet. It is not an extreme amount, but it'll cost a bit. <br />
<br />
If you're not the CEO of the corporation, you will have to have either the Director or Personnel Manager role. This will allow you to set up an advertisement in any region you wish. But hold on, you will need to have an office in that region. So let's look at a picture (no, it's not a new Trinity model). <br />
<br />
<img src="http://myeve.eve-online.com/bitmaps/img/devblog/ouradverts.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
As you can see here, all your active advertisements are visible, as well as the button &quot;add&quot; for placing new ads. Provided that you have a corporation, the role, and and an office in the region, you can proceeed. When you hit the &quot;Add&quot; button it will bring up this window: <br />
<img src="http://myeve.eve-online.com/bitmaps/img/devblog/add.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
First you see that you can select how long it should last and since the price is calculated from this, be sure that you have enough ISK in your main corp wallet (Division 1) to cover the cost. You can have the ad up for up to 30 days and each day will cost you 250.000 ISK along with a one time per ad 500.000 ISK setup fee. The total cost is thus 750.000 to 8.000.000 ISK, depending on your choice. Then you select the races you wish to hire, you can select just one, all or any combination of races. Prospective employees will then be able to see this and having &quot;all&quot; is good as you're likely to get more people interested. After that you select the operation area, which is the three areas of space (high, low and null). Players who wants to have access to 0.0 will be interested in the null sec space. This is pretty much self explanatory. <br />
<br />
Operations say what your corp does on a daily basis. So tick whatever is appropriate. You can also set a limit on the amount of skillpoints players has to have in order to join your corporation. So input that here as a minimum requirement. Then we have a 1000 character box where you can write an essay on theoretical physics or whatever you wish to write. Best is to give players information though, that you can not give in any of the other selections. Things like where to go, chat channels to join, and so forth. Your choice! <br />
<br />
When you're done you have to go over your selections and your text to make sure everything is correct as once you hit OK you will not be able to change anything. When you press OK you are all set and your advertisement is up for everyone to see! You can of course do this in as many regions as you wish, provided that you have an office there. Also, in Our Adverts, you can remove any ad by right clicking on it. <br />
<br />
This is easy enough, right? Remember that right clicking brings up additional choices, like show info on the corp and such. But we are not done yet, let's take a look at it from the other end. <br />
<br />
If you are looking to find a corp for the first time, or you are tired of the constant fleet battles and null sec operation and desire to move to empire for some veldspar mining, then here you go! You can now find the corp to your liking. The &quot;Other Adverts&quot; tab is your friend, here you can start setting up your search. Select the region, if you care about alliance or not, how many members the corp has and if you want to limit by skillpoints as you can see in the image below. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://myeve.eve-online.com/bitmaps/img/devblog/other.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
Now you will get all adverts in that region. If you feel it's too many, you can start filtering through using the filters page. Here you can further define what you are looking for so that only advertisements that fit your criteria are shown. <br />
<br />
<img src="http://myeve.eve-online.com/bitmaps/img/devblog/filtering.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
When you look at the list, you can see various basic information. You see timestamps when the advertisement was created, when it will expire, the name of the corp, what alliance it is in (if any) and the location of the office. If you see something that catches your eye, you can double click on the advert which will bring up more comprehensive information, showing everything the corp is looking for and the personalized 1000 character &quot;sales pitch&quot;. <br />
<br />
We haven't changed the process of joining a corp though. You still need to travel to the nearest office and send in an application. Corporations also have different ways of going through the process, so you might need to join a chat channel, send a message to some players etc. This means that corporations should include all necessary information in the text box provided about the way they handle their recruitment. <br />
<br />
This should explain how it all works, but we're not quite done yet, there is more coming so read on! <br />
<br />
We are working on expanding, tweaking, adding more filters and functionality to this feature. For example: <br />
<br />
Input a chat channel directly into it as a link <br />
List of recruiters <br />
More graphics into the advertisements <br />
A tutorial <br />
A welcome page <br />
And more... <br />
<br />
If you have any suggestions on improving the Corporate Registry, please head out into the feature and development section of the forums and voice your opinion. Or you can just shout in the thread attached to this blog. We do hope that this will ease the transition into a corp for new and old players alike, and that corporations will now have a tool to make themselves more visible to others.<br />
