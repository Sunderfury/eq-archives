				What it means is that the majority of items we've made to place in cities, villages, dungeons, etc. are also compatible with our house system. So just about anything you see in a, say, a dungeon, could be either crafted or taken from the dungeon (usually in the form of loot) and placed in your house. <br />
<br />
So let's say you saw a cool painting in New Targenor or an impressive statue in a dungeon. With our housing system, there is nothing stopping us from making an item that is associated with that object that you could then put in your inventory, travel to your house, and then place where you wanted it.<br />
<br />
Many of these objects that you see in the world, you will be able to use the crafting system to create a copy of your own. Other objects you see may not be created via the crafting system, but actual drops off of a mob, or a quest reward.<br />
<br />
What I really like about this system is that it creates a link between adventurers/achievers and those who are really into decorating houses. For me personally, as an example, decorating a house in and of itself is not that big of a deal (whereas it is for many people). But add to it that I could, say, defeat a certain boss mob and get a drop off its corpse that was it's head or some object that is seen only in the boss mob's room and then take that item and decorate my house with it, and suddenly I'm really into this system. Having people over to my house to show off the head of a rare wyvern mounted to my wall, or the totem of a rare ogre shaman sitting on my table, is very cool. Now items that drop from rare mobs might not only be cool equipment I can use for my character or trade/sell to somebody else, but also decorative items that when placed in my house display the same object that people may see in the depths of a dungeon, showing that me and my friends were there and defeated said encounter.<br />
<br />
And when you consider that the vast majority of items made to decorate areas of the world are compatible with our house decorating system and just need inventory items made that refer to that object, we're easily talking about several thousand objects.<br />
<br />
So, no, this is not an E3 misunderstanding/miscommunication.<br />

It's the same looking UI that they released waaay back, and that was a placeholder. They hoped (as in I don't know if they will do it or not) to have several UIs in by launch, seperate for race/class.<br />
<br />
also considering that it is completely customizable, and will be by the community, the UI is not really my primary worry when it comes down to it.</div>

There are many different sort of boats that players can get.<br />
I don't think that the most extravagant ships will be featured in screenshots, just as they have said that they won't be releasing screenshots (nor opening up the places in beta) of where/what the biggest mobs are.<br />
<br />
Some of the earlier screenies show other boats tho that are slightly bigger.</div>

				LOS ANGELES--If you're Sigil cofounders Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler, you probably consider this E3 to be pretty important, since it marked the announcement that Sigil Games' upcoming massively multiplayer game Vanguard: Saga of Heroes will be published by Sony Online Entertainment, not the company's longtime publishing partner Microsoft. If you don't happen to be one of those two men, you may still be interested in hearing the latest details on the game and its status. <br />
<br />
According to McQuaid, the studio decided to sign on with Sony Online and bid Microsoft farewell because &quot;over time, it became clear that [Microsoft wasn't] the right partner,&quot; even though the decision ended with &quot;a very amicable departure.&quot; McQuaid and Butler were both quick to point out that the split also gave Sigil the opportunity to buy back Vanguard's publishing and intellectual property rights, which will &quot;let Sigil focus on making the best game possible.&quot; The two principals also explained that although the change in publisher may have seemed like a sudden move, it's something that Sigil has known about for some time, and has prepared itself for amply--the game&#8217;s billing and online patching systems, for instance, should be easy to transfer over to Sony Online's servers. <br />
<br />
We also had a chance to take an updated look at the game itself, which is currently in an early beta state. Apparently, Sigil is in the process of reevaluating the content on the game's first two continents to make sure there's a good amount of content balanced against Vanguard's vast overland areas. The development team has evidently been working on some pretty environmental effects, such as a new reflective water effect that causes sunlight to sparkle on the surface, and enhanced weather effects, such as moving storm fronts (which apparently have an active bearing on gameplay, since some character classes will possess special powers to manipulate the weather, while other character classes will possess abilities that will wax and wane with certain climates). <br />
<br />
However, much more development time has apparently been invested into developing player housing and character customization. According to Butler, the beta version of the game already contains more housing-related content and options than Star Wars Galaxies, including a total of more than 8,000 different craftable items, which can all be placed in a player-owned house with an easy-to-use mouse-driven interface that lets players quickly place objects on tables, on walls, or on the floor. Housing will also have a highly customizable permissions system for entry, so you'll be able to, for instance, turn your home into a public shop that's open during certain hours of the day, then automatically converts to a private dwelling at off-hours. <br />
<br />
During our demonstration, we also had a chance to visit two different dungeon areas, which were vaguely reminiscent of the classic EverQuest dungeons Crushbone (a mostly outdoor dungeon inhabited by surface-dwelling monsters) and Unrest (an ancient mansion haunted by undead creatures), respectively. However, these new dungeons were many times larger than their EverQuest predecessors, and inhabited by much larger, meaner critters, such as hulking rock monsters, misshapen zombies, and, of course, scantily-clad vampire ladies. To navigate the game's huge world, Sigil still plans to implement affordable mounts (such as cheap horses) and affordable boats, though the game will also offer pricier modes of transportation with much better benefits. Flying mounts, such as the winged dragon we saw in action, will further help cut down on travel times and will also let players access remote areas at high altitudes. Flying mounts will, according to Butler, &quot;definitely be in the game at launch,&quot; though Sigil also hopes to implement mounted combat and naval combat in further updates post-launch. <br />
<br />
Vanguard appears to offer both great depth and great breadth, especially for experienced players who are looking for a more in-depth, and potentially more challenging online role-playing experience. The team is pushing hard to release the game &quot;this winter,&quot; according to McQuaid. <br />

They are fixing the gameplay first, then the continents. The continents are already active, and have been so for... um.... a very long time, just not turned on (outside of the dev version).<br />
<br />
Once all the other elements are working, going over the continents will be faster and easier. (And the game is still 6+ months away)<br />

What it means is that the majority of items we've made to place in cities, villages, dungeons, etc. are also compatible with our house system. So just about anything you see in a, say, a dungeon, could be either crafted or taken from the dungeon (usually in the form of loot) and placed in your house.<br />
<br />
So let's say you saw a cool painting in New Targenor or an impressive statue in a dungeon. With our housing system, there is nothing stopping us from making an item that is associated with that object that you could then put in your inventory, travel to your house, and then place where you wanted it.<br />
<br />
Many of these objects that you see in the world, you will be able to use the crafting system to create a copy of your own. Other objects you see may not be created via the crafting system, but actual drops off of a mob, or a quest reward.<br />
<br />
What I really like about this system is that it creates a link between adventurers/achievers and those who are really into decorating houses. For me personally, as an example, decorating a house in and of itself is not that big of a deal (whereas it is for many people). But add to it that I could, say, defeat a certain boss mob and get a drop off its corpse that was it's head or some object that is seen only in the boss mob's room and then take that item and decorate my house with it, and suddenly I'm really into this system. Having people over to my house to show off the head of a rare wyvern mounted to my wall, or the totem of a rare ogre shaman sitting on my table, is very cool. Now items that drop from rare mobs might not only be cool equipment I can use for my character or trade/sell to somebody else, but also decorative items that when placed in my house display the same object that people may see in the depths of a dungeon, showing that me and my friends were there and defeated said encounter.<br />
<br />
And when you consider that the vast majority of items made to decorate areas of the world are compatible with our house decorating system and just need inventory items made that refer to that object, we're easily talking about several thousand objects.</div>
