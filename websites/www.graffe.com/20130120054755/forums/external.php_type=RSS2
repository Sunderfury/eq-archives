			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, in the future lets assume that we have some tech where we can achieve Ghost in the Shell or Deus Ex level of enhancements, what skill ups are you going for?<br />
<br />
I am going for increased jump so that I can dunk like Lebron James again or someone from NBA Jams.  I think echo location is sweet so I could boost that skill, then I would add the ability to see in infrared, and feel magnetic fields in a precise manner.  I also want the ability to see an overlay of the world with useful info through a HUD (we can already do this to an extent, but I want something awesome).  I would also add additional arms so that I could control more devices simultaneously.  <br />
<br />
I could be rocking rocket launchers in two hands and then doing work or bringing up data with my other two being a John Rambo Übermensch that can do mechanically intensive tasks while simultaneously doing mental work.  I want a neural interface to computers too and the ability to store ever thing I have ever seen and transform that with my mind into a new novel realization instead of having to do so with limited memory, basically utilize our resources well instead of having so much redundant matter in the event of trauma.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also want some wolverine claws and an adamantium skeleton as that is super sweet.  I also wish that I could curl up with a tough exterior armor like an armadillo or turtle,  providing an excellent barrier in the event of overwhelming odds.  I would also like to be able to do complex calculations in real time such that it is effectively the same as recalling from memory</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I had quite the health scare as far as my career longevity goes a few months back.  After years of spending long sessions working or gaming at a time on my computer, and not utilizing best practices for typing etc.  such behavior caught up with me.  The foolish invincibility of youth was shattered.  My hands developed RSI, and typing for any length of time was severely painful such that I was forced to not type at all essentially.  Luckily this was during summer break.  Even writing was painful for any length of time. <br />
<br />
 I thought I was going to have to start using a Dragon Naturally Speaking app just to communicate electronically, and how well could that really work for programming even? I doubt DNS would approach the efficacy of my input to any degree at all, or be able to capture the esoteric spelling and conventions well.  Basically, if the situation persisted I was hosed, so I had to do something about it as even having surgery would not bring my hands back to life fully.<br />
<br />
I was incredibly fortunate though that my hands did recover and I was able to resume typing and writing for short stints, taking a break after 20 minutes or so and making sure to hold my hands and arms at suggested positions so that I aided my own interests.  Utilizing Aspercreme initially majorly went a long way to reducing the soreness experienced.  Those two things made a huge difference.  Since then, I've purchased an ergonomic keyboard so that on epic death marches I don't wind up bleeding out in a ditch as my hands die in the night.  <br />
<br />
Xahlee did a lot of reviews for various keyboard designs and layouts that are worth reading. The ones he likes various in price, on the low end are the Microsoft ergonomic line of keyboards.  These are probably his third favorite keyboards, and Microsoft did a solid job designing and also making them cheap.  There are others he likes.  Two of them he likes are the kinesis countoured keyboard (what I use): <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboard_Kinesis.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboard_Kinesis.htm</a> and the uTRON keyboard: <a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/uTRON_keyboard.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://xahlee.info/kbd/uTRON_keyboard.html</a> <br />
<br />
I like the uTRON one the best but it is also very expensive for a keyboard.  I think it is the best though if you need to take a keyboard with you when traveling as it is split in half, making it much more compact than either the MS one or the Kinesis option.  The Kinesis uses mechanical keys though if you like that sort of thing.  It's kind of noisy though, so the Kinesis linear may be more your style.<br />
<br />
In any event, even if you think getting RSI is unlikely, why take the chance when preventing it is free (using good hand form) or up to a &lt; 500 dollar investment that will last for years.  For most of us losing usage of our hands would effectively make us out of work in short order, so the downside of risking this is severe, and I can assure you even the onset of it is agonizing.  Your hands will throb for hours even if you aren't using them, even using the xbox controller will be painful, and if it worsens you'll have to get expensive surgery which won't even result in a full recovery.<br />
<br />
Laptop keyboards are unfortunately the worst when it comes to ergonomics, and it's not super convenient to tote around a big keyboard, but at least good hand form and reasonable breaks are implementable in such situations, which is most of the battle, training ourselves to help ourselves help our future selves, as the tendency is to do whatever is convenient and habit.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This isn't a rant, but I posted this in here due to the NSFW topic.  So, like most people with a dick, even when I'm in a relationship I like porn.  It's a great stress relief and it's not as though there is a ration on ejaculate.  In the past I was using some streaming sites, or when I wanted some 1080p content I would download it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, so in the interest of science I checked out the pricing of one of the streaming sites that has a bunch of the different networks bundled together for one price.  And, holy shit these prices are cheap.  For 1080p streams and the ability to download the scene in multiple formats at a high bitrate it was only 8 bucks a month.  <br />
<br />
It is by far the best 100 dollars I've spent (it was 8 dollars for 12 months of service), and I had no idea how inexpensive it was all this time.  I thought was like 20+ dollars for just one person's site, and here I can get 37 for 8 bucks.  The amount of videos is in the 6000+ range and it is well organized, which brings me to another point.<br />
<br />
Why are torrent and adult sites, the illegal/sinful sites, inevitably always much better designed than the legit, uber well funded megacorps?  The former sites always have a clean aesthetic, exceptional layout, excellent categories, and great search and other features, as well as some sort of comment/social feature.  It seems if anything it should be the other way around, but nope.  <br />
<br />
The megacorps sites are nearly always very cluttered and finding the actual content you want is nontrivial, they are basically the Wal-Mart grocery aisle layouts for the Internet.  The are designed to take as long as possible to get to where you want to go to so that you see more of their content I am guessing.<br />
<br />
One especially egregious example of this is how much of a clusterfuck the iTunes store is. Sure, it's pretty, but using their advanced searches is a total pain in the dick, and just navigating the site is really slow and inefficient.  Another example is Yahoo's site.  There is 100 different content categories and distracting as hell.  I think it was designed by artists on LSD while coding it up as that is about the only way someone would consider the facial imagery explosion delivered in category vomit format is reasonable.<br />
<br />
Google's websites are for the most part an exception to this trend.  Google+ however has gotten worse and worse over time in its layout, with much of the content being very poorly sized, making original content hard to view compared to a better layout that is more like their minimalistic designs of their email and search features.<br />
<br />
Another example is 4Chan's website (don't go here, it is awful, but if you had the unfortunate experience of going there the layout should be fresh).  Even though their was a ton of image content it was always the focus of the page, not something in a jungle of ads and other crap.<br />
<br />
The Verge is another capitalistic site that has a good layout.  It is very modern while still presenting the information that is important to the user with minimal unrelated content.  Also, I think Amazon and New Egg have good site designs, both of which have a ton of different kinds of information to display.  <br />
<br />
And that is what grinds my gears.</div>

Somehow the composers managed to come up with music that's not completely annoying, works well ambiently, and is a delight for the eyes.<br />

I thought people here might appreciate it, although be warned - if you play it for your kids who are just walking and making specific sub-verbal requests, you'll probably spend the next year watching it on repeat. :D</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I recently started back running again after growing tired of my previous cardio routine (elliptical).  I have some running shoes already, but in the interest of not damaging my feet after continual long runs I thought I would try the toe shoes.  I was doubtful at first, and they look strange to be sure, but the reviews were so fantastic from runners and the health effects of running in general is a much worse outcome that I thought to try them.<br />
<br />
The ones I purchased were these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vibram-FiveFingers-Grey-Palm-Shoes/dp/B001JYDEYU/ref=sr_1_1?s=shoes&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358618941&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Vibram+Fivefingers+Kso+Mens+Running+Shoes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Vibram-FiveFin...+Running+Shoes</a><br />
<br />
I've been wearing them for a few weeks now, and so far they have been great.  Your stride changes a bit but will become habit after a week or so, but these shoes really show off how impressively well engineered humans are for the most part.  Unlike popular opinion until recent research, our feet are actually incredibly well designed, able to dynamically adjust to different terrain to optimally apply the stress endured while running, which is a tremendous strain on our knees and feet and ankles unless you go barefoot.  <br />
<br />
I highly recommend these for those of you who do run or want to start running to avoid injury that would take you out of exercising for a while and hurt the performance gains you've made.  With these I can go for morning runs for miles everyday and not worry about being side lined after a few months.  I just wear some thin socks with them, but some people wear them barefoot.  I like to wear at least some socks though as shoes tend to get smelly otherwise, and rubber is not very kind to removing odor.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I need to get a new tablet because someone else cabbaged onto my iPad and I was going to get the iPad mini when it gets a retina version anyways.  Since, I don't really want to pay 350+ for a tablet I am going to replace in &lt; a year, I was looking at the nexus 7 device as it is much cheaper.  <br />
<br />
I was researching the battery life on it though and a lot of users were claiming that its real world battery life was more like 6-7 hours instead of the 10+ that it is advertised.  That seems really low to me and somewhat unreasonable.  Are you actually seeing that short of a battery life or do you get more? When I'm reading new comic series or books I tend to zerg through them and would prefer to not have to recharge half-way through.<br />
<br />
Another thing, are there any cool apps on the android that you consider to be exceptional and that I should look into?</div>

Trying to get all websites everywhere to support a hardware device is not going to happen.  People are also going to lose or not carry additional items just for the purpose of authenticating.  It has to be more convenient than simple passwords as the typical users does not care about security at all even if that is a long term worse outcome for them.  They are short sighted so the complete apathy of most users needs to be the most important aspect the solution is designed to account for.  <br />
<br />
Instead Google should push its own Google authentication design that is exceptional and use that for everything possible and have the option of only the device being the authentication mechanism, which while the security sensitive people would utilize the two-factor security still, removing passwords entirely for the apathetic would be a huge boon for everyone on the net.  It could achieve what OpenID should have, removing every website that requires an account from being an attack vector, amplifying the impact of break ins into a corporation as password reuse is common.  Google should utilize both a smart phone option or having the hardware device like Blizzard does for battle.net to great success.</div>

For me, it is the balance of everything: strategy, skill, athleticism of all types, teamwork and coordination between specialists, general spectacle, and parity.  No other sport has quite the same mix.  It seems like people like to fixate on one aspect of the game as the explanation for why it's so popular (the hitting, the downtime, the big plays, the marketing and presentation) but it's the way it all mixes together that sets football apart.  <br />
<br />
Although football is a complex game, the basics aren't that hard to learn.  Downs, 1st downs, touchdowns, running, passing, tackling, blocking, punting, kickoffs.  Most of the complicated details and situations are edge cases the follow from the basics.<br />
<br />
Football, at least in the modern NFL, is a very spread out game especially considering the premise.  Although there are the power dives up the middle and fumble-recovery piles, those don't make up a majority of plays.  This makes the game easy to follow visually.  Much of the complexity, decision-making, and athleticism in football is all in plain sight.  In fact, there tends to be so much going on visually that an average viewer can't even absorb it all.  I find this contrasts somewhat with some other sports.  In baseball, for example, it can be very difficult to follow something like pitching.  It happens so fast and it's so difficult to shoot from a good angle that it takes quite an experienced viewer to truly distinguish between a good pitch and a bad pitch.  Of course, there's still plenty of tension to be enjoyed focusing on the outcome but it's not like football where you can see everything happening.  I also noticed this a bit watching rugby-- I haven't watched enough rugby to make a fair assessment of the any particular league but it seemed to me that a lot of the potentially interesting gameplay winds up hidden beneath a pile or scrum.<br />
<br />
It's also great for its strategic balance and purity.  For each play, both the offense and defense has a specific plan of action and although they may deviate or ad lib the result is almost always a consequence of the play that was called and the ability of the players to execute the play as planned.  This is much different from soccer and basketball.  In those games, set plays and strategies do not typically have such a direct relationship with results.  Basketball is heavily oriented towards skill and athleticism at the expense of strategy.  While offenses do run plays, being able to beat a defender one-on-one or make open shots are far more important skills (or not get beat / stop / block shots on defense).  In soccer, set plays may see results but those results are almost always temporary and eventually result in a turnover or a missed shot.  Obviously Basketball and soccer both have over-arching strategy, but football has that too in addition to the play-by-play strategy.<br />
<br />
Football (since 1978 anyway) is also slightly biased towards offense, while still being very balanced.  It seems that for the most part as players become stronger, faster, and more skilled the scores seem to be edging up very slightly and riskier strategies become more worthwhile.  There's an average of about 8 scoring events per game (~60% touchdowns, ~40% field goals), though obviously those aren't distributed equally.  The obvious goat here is soccer, where 3 goals in a game is above average.  Although it's possible in football for one team to outplay the other in most facets of the game and still lose due to some unlucky breaks, it's much less than in soccer and obviously-- there are rarely ties in football.  Although I don't think association footballs low scores are a reason to hate the game, I must admit I much prefer the scoring frequency of the NFL.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Three articles about this whole hoax thing.  One is a general article about the whole thing, the second is one claiming he was 'catfished', and the third covering nine of the many odd things about this whole thing.  I can't help but think he was part of it and used it to be more in the national spotlight, but then again I'm a cynic.  As for what this will do to him in regards to draft position, it's hard to say, but I doubt pro teams will care much, although it may drop him a bit.  Pro teams have shown they don't give that much of a shit about reputation when it comes to players, Dez Bryant, Suh, Pacman Jones come to mind, and I rank this significantly below their idiocy.  It's just a really odd story that makes him, and Notre Dame, look kind of dumb.<br />
