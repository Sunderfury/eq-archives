		<blockquote class="restore">So I'm getting a little tired of my current WiFi configuration. The Downstairs living room is where the cable comes in from the street, and I have the cable modem. That isn't too big a deal, but I want a better signal throughout the home. <br />
<br />
If I put a Cat5 cable from the cable modem (Point A) on say, #3, and link it to an uplink port on a wireless router (Point B) upstairs, and then set up a repeater (Point C) on the same channel information as the router, and then plug in via cat5 into the repeater (Point C), the devices in the room I want &quot;wired.&quot; will that work?<br />
<br />
I know, I'll be at the mercy of the repeater/wireless from Point B to Point C, but it should reduce, significantly, the amount of conflict from all the other devices right? <br />
<br />
If this is a good idea, I'm considering getting a higher bandwidth Repeater and Router in order to perform this better, but I'm going to start with some old ones that I've got on hand that I'm not doing very much with. <br />
<br />
Point A, and Point B are on two different levels of the home from eachother. I've currently got some Coax Cable going from one floor to the other through the wall, so I figured I'd pull the plates and send the cat 5 down against the coax in order to get this part done easily. I hate wires running everywhere, and don't want to go through the attic (there's virtually no crawlspace in this home), so WiFi at a short distance in this fashion is my next best option.</blockquote>

</div>I super highly recommend ripping out your carpets when you get some time, especially if any of you have allergies. Assuming you have a concrete foundation it is preferable to carpet. It is impossible to not have grotesque carpetry regardless of how much it is cleaned, even by professional cleaning crews. It is harder to maintain compared to all other flooring options and degrades overtime in the quality of texture. I am not impressed at all by the integrity of stained concrete even though I enjoy its patterns, so it is a waste of resources IMO. If I had to have a carpet though I would have astroturf as it is easier to maintain. <br />
<br />
Carpet simply is not made for humans.</blockquote>

I tried plugging in from my laptop (which is connected wirelessly) via Cat5 into the Repeater. <br />

It doesn't want to connect via Ethernet From windows to the Router/Repeater. <br />

I cannot remember how to do this. <br />

I guess I could just hard reset the router, but I'd rather not. I also have a TP-Link router configured with DD-WRT, but I'd rather get this Linksys to work. <br />

</div>My current keyboard has &gt; 1000 possible keys per layout. Come at me bro. I am actually not joking. It is more like a game controller than a traditional keyboard as its main advantage is running macros for things like debugging/reverse engineering code etc. Because everything is done on the firmware side it is cross-platform without having to write a new driver for it that the OS understands. If the USB HID spec wasn't complete shit I would not have had to write a lot of hacks to get it to work correctly though. I wish there was a convenient to access way to embed my 3D mouse in it though.</blockquote>

</div>IDK what it is but that is what makes my hands ache the most is the trackpad. I can't figure it out. But even if I use Apple's insanely great trackpad design and execution or Logitech's approximation of it (which is also really good in the context of trackpads which with exception to early versions of IBM's clitmouse is the best laptop mouse execution), it sets my tendons on fire in short order. It's unique in that as no other device bothers me anymore to use for reasonable amounts of times. <br />
<br />
Also, looking up that keyboard you are using, you poor goddamn soul. I would rather use a comfortable software keyboard over those little nibbly keys in a matrix. That is a great example of the &gt; 99% of HID not being designed for humans. Nothing about that device is made for humans. The persons who would be suited to use it don't exist.<br />
<br />
Even if they wanted to be lazy, thoughtless bastard children they could have rainbowned the keys about some vertex. They have endless better examples available through musical instruments to inspire them. That is extremely aggravating to see.</blockquote>
