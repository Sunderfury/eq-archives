  <b>August 6 Content Release Notes</b><br />
<br />
 <b>LIVING WORLD</b><br />
<b>Queen’s Jubilee</b><br />
A celebration to commemorate ten years of Queen Jennah’s rule is about  to kick off in Divinity’s Reach! The queen has commissioned a new  gladiatorial arena for the occasion—the Crown Pavilion—as a shining  symbol of her people’s endurance. Take a hot air balloon ride with  dignitaries from across Tyria to the capital of the Krytan nation, and  be there for the opening ceremony. Join in the festivities and compete  in ceremonial combat in Her Majesty’s honor!<br />
 <b>Hot Air Balloons</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">The queen’s court has sent out hot air balloons to transport celebrants! Look for balloon towers all over Tyria.</li><li style="">Ascend to the top of a balloon tower to claim a royal gift before embarking on the journey to Divinity’s Reach.</li><li style="">Watch for all-new dynamic events as the balloon pilots may need help keeping everything running smoothly.</li><li style="">A special hot air balloon souvenir will be given to players who are festive enough to visit 30 towers.</li></ul><br />
 <b>The Crown Pavilion</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">The arts district in Divinity’s Reach that was destroyed by the  Great Collapse has been rebuilt into the Crown Pavilion, a grand arena  that will host Kryta’s biggest events.</li><li style="">Enter the Queen’s Gauntlet to battle mighty representations of humanity’s most vicious enemies.</li><li style="">Visit the emissaries from six major nations of Tyria. A unique set  of boons to improve magic find and combat stats will be available to  those who wish to represent the emissaries.</li><li style="">Earn Watchwork Sprockets, a new trophy from the Watchknights, to  purchase rewards from the emissaries. Purchasable rewards include:<br />
<ul><li style="">New Sovereign weapon sets</li><li style="">New crafting recipes for runes and sigils</li><li style="">Cultural weapon sets</li></ul></li></ul><br />
 <b>The Queen’s Gauntlet</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Face increasingly difficult challenges in single combat against a variety of unique bosses.</li><li style="">Take a risk with special gambit conditions to earn even more prestigious rewards.</li><li style="">Each entry and gambit costs one Queen’s Gauntlet ticket. Tickets  drop regularly from creatures in the Crown Pavilion and around the  world. Players may also purchase tickets from the emissaries in the  Crown Pavilion.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Opening Ceremony</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Witness the unveiling of the Crown Pavilion in a brand new Living  World story instance featuring familiar faces such as Queen Jennah,  Logan Thackeray, Countess Anise, Lord Faren, Rox, and Braham.</li><li style="">Rumors are running high that the queen will be taking volunteers  for the inaugural contest with the Watchknights. There’s no telling who  might show up!</li><li style="">Enter the instanced area simply by visiting the Crown Pavilion for the first time.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Beacons of Kryta</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Find torchbearers around Divinity’s Reach to activate a special time-limited race to light several beacons around the city.</li><li style="">Successfully complete all four torch runs to earn the Flames of  Kryta, a permanent item that can be used to illuminate the player’s path  through darkness.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Achievements</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">A rotation of Living World achievements has been added to the Daily Achievement category.</li><li style="">Completing the Queen’s Jubilee meta-achievement awards the player a  Mini Watchknight. Completing this meta-achievement requires players to  complete 18 achievements from either the Queen’s Jubilee category or the  jubilee-related dailies.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Exotic Drop</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Play Queen’s Jubilee content for a chance at the exotic Watchwork Portal Device recipe.</li><li style="">The recipe requires a level 400 artificer. It requires 5 Orichalcum  Ingots, 1 Master Tuning Crystal, 1 Charged Lodestone, and 75 Watchwork  Sprockets.</li><li style="">The Watchwork Portal Device is a one-time use consumable that  allows players to create a portal between two points. It cannot be used  in conjunction with the mesmer’s portal.</li></ul><br />

 *Improved Effects Culling<br />
*<br />
 <br />

<br />
<br />
I've recently been reminded that I still have some &quot;buddy keys&quot; remaining for The Secret World. The keys are good for a 3-day (72-hour) trial of the game.<br />
<br />
TSW requires no subscription, but you have to purchase a copy of the game (boxed or digital) if you want to keep playing after the trial.<br />
<br />
Fair warning, the client (<a href="http://cdn.funcom.com/tsw/live/setup.exe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">installer downloadable here</a>) is almost 40GiB, so you should make sure it's fully downloaded before you redeem a key to maximize play time.<br />
<br />
If you want to give the game a shot just PM me your email address. I'll send out invites while I have them.</div>

			Eve players stage giant online space battle<br />
<br />
One of the largest video game space battles ever seen has taken place in the Eve Online game.<br />
<br />
For five hours on 28 July about 4,000 players took part in the epic battle between two of the game's biggest alliances.<br />
<br />
The two sides were fighting for control of resources within several of the game's solar systems.<br />
<br />
Time was slowed down in the virtual universe to help servers cope with the huge numbers of players and ships.<br />
<br />
The battle pitted spaceships belonging to CFC against those from the Test Alliance in a region of space known as 6VDT. It ended in victory for CFC.<br />
<br />
Eve Online is a detailed space simulation that sees players fly spaceships through thousands of virtual star systems, seeking resources they can use to prosper.<br />
<br />
The resources can be found on planets and in asteroid fields or acquired through piracy or other underhand means.<br />
<br />
Ships vary in size from small trading vessels to giant capital ships.<br />
<br />
Erlendur Thorsteinsson, one of Eve Online's developers, confirmed in a tweet that the battle was the biggest ever seen in the game.<br />
<br />
At its peak the battle involved 4,070 pilots and their ships.<br />
<br />
Game time was slowed to 10% of normal to lighten the load on servers working out who was shooting at whom.<br />
<br />
The pivotal moment in the battle took place two hours in, when CFC sent in a large fleet of capital ships - the most powerful in the game.<br />
<br />
Their arrival prompted many members of the Test Alliance to try to flee.<br />
<br />
By the end of the conflict thousands of ships are believed to have been destroyed.<br />
<br />
Their destruction has a real-world cost as the game's internal currency can be bought with real money.<br />
<br />
So far no-one has worked out the total value of the ships destroyed, but a far smaller battle earlier in 2013 laid waste to far fewer spacecraft that in total were estimated to be worth more than $15,000 (£10,000).<br />
<br />
The giant battle was the culmination of a long campaign by CFC to force the Test Alliance out of 6VDT.<br />
<br />
Some have speculated that it may be the only the first of a series of conflicts that seek to extinguish TEST.<br />
<br />
&quot;These kinds of conflicts are business as usual in Eve but this one was bigger than normal,&quot; said James Binns from the PCGamesN website.<br />
<br />
Mr Binns said several big events had made the last few weeks in Eve absorbing to watch. During that time a giant ship was hijacked and then destroyed in a carefully co-ordinated ambush and a huge in-game corporation was disbanded and its resources stolen by a spy from a rival faction.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a fascinating online world and its constant drama is nothing like any other game,&quot; he said.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I am honestly quite surprised an event in EVE got picked up by the BBC but 4000 people is likely bigger than any PVP battle in previous history in MMORPGs at least.</div>

Mini games look good.  Love the idea of deciding on a fractal to be built.  I bet the "survive the waves of critters" game devolves into a "LFG Warriors Guardians Mesmers ONLY" thing.]]></description>

<br />
To summarize the big stuff:<br />
<br />
Two week release schedule has more permanent stuff than before (Apparently Mal called them to complain)<br />
Gear will cap at ascended but ascended will be avail for all slots<br />
Ascended will be made with new 500 level crafting using drops achieved in limited ways (dungeon runs keep conquest)<br />
Ascended will also rarely drop in the world but be account bound<br />
Character progression will not be gear treadmill but will move into getting new skills and traits.<br />
Champions will have Champion chests that drop lots of good stuff in order to make killing them worthwhile and encourage people to do the harder content<br />
Balancing out doing dungeons to eliminate CoF money runs and encourage people to do different paths to get better rewards<br />
Some kind of limited once per day crafting reward stuff is coming.... little fuzzy on that one<br />
Elimination of Magic Find stat (yay!!!) there will be some kind of compensation for your magic find items<br />
Some new mechanic in WvW to replace the failed orb mechanic to create a more dynamic event thingy in WvW<br />
A way to make legendary precursors<br />
New Legendaries<br />
Legendaries get the special ability to have their stats be changed on the fly.  <br />
Legendaries cap at ascended level stats</div>
