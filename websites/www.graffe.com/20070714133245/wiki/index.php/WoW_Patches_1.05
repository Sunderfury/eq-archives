</p><p><b>PvP</b>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Honor system
<ul>
<li>Dishonorable kills - Gained by killing a trivial Civilian NPC. Now has a negative impact on a player's honor. Enough dishonorable kills will reduce a player's rank to zero.
<li>Players will now see an "estimated honor point (formerly contribution point) value" in the combat log for an honorable kill. Note that this value does not take diminishing returns against the same player into account and is therefore "estimated."
<li>"Team Contribution Points" has been renamed to "Honor"
<li>Added tooltips to the different elements of the Honor System UI
<li>Players will see their last week's kill data in the "Last Week" section of the Honor System UI even if they did not achieve the 25 honorable kills required to gain standing or rank.

<p><br />
</p>
<pre><b>Rogues</b>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Riposte - Fixed a bug where the ability was not usable against a disarmed or unarmed target.
<li>Vanish - Should be a lot more responsive when used to avoid incoming attacks.
<li>Combo points are removed when your target is dead.
<li>You no longer lose combo points when your target is blinded in a duel.
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<pre><b>Shaman </b>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Fire Nova, Flametongue, Stoneclaw and Windfury Totems had incorrect level caps when cast by higher level Shaman.  All totems should now be summoned at the level of the caster.

<p><br />
</p>

<li>Improved Enslave Demon - In addition to reducing the attack speed and casting speed penalty of enslaved demons, it now reduces the resist chance of Enslave Demon by 2/4/6/8/10%.
<li>Demonic Sacrifice - Is now instant cast.
<li>Improved Firestone - Now also improves the bonus Fire spell damage of Firestones by 15/30%.
<li>Inferno - The summoned Infernal will now be enslaved for 5 minutes before turning on its summoner.
<li>Drain Mana - Targets with no mana will no longer be valid for Drain Mana (Rank 4), making it consistent with all other ranks of the spell.

<li>Improved Drain Mana - Damage caused by this talent is now improved by the Shadow Mastery talent.
<li>Conflagrate - Range increased.
<li>Siphon Life - Is now instant cast, damage increased.

<li>Improved Curse of Agony - Fixed a bug where Curse of Agony (rank 1) was not improved by the talent.  The talent will now work properly with all ranks of Curse of Agony.
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<pre><b>Warriors</b>
</pre>
<ul>

<li>Deathwish - Is now usable while under a Fear effect, and will also remove an existing Fear effect.
<li>Overpower - Fixed a bug where the ability was sometimes blocked.
<li>Improved Cleave - Now increases damage bonus by 40/80/120%.

<li>New Fury Talent: Dual Wield Specialization - Increases damage with the off-hand weapon by 5/10/15/20/25%.  Note: the additional damage also increases rage generation significantly.
<li>Iron Will - Fixed a bug that caused many abilities to ignore the additional resistance.
<li>Enrage - Increased the number of charges to 12.  Decreased the duration to 12 seconds.  The new duration is the limiting factor for slower weapons (e.g. Arcanite Reaper will typically get one less swing), while dual wielding and faster weapons will make better use of all of the charges over the duration of the ability.
<li>Concussion Blow - Changed to an instant, stunning attack and removed the damage portion.
<li>Shield Specialization - In addition to increasing % chance to block, it now gives the Warrior a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to generate one rage on a successful block.
<li>Deep Wounds can now be triggered by critical strikes from combat abilities.
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Items</b>

<li>Mature Blue Dragon Sinew and The Eye of Shadow can both now drop off appropriate-level demonic and blue dragonkin monsters. It should be noted that both Lord Kazzak and Azuregos will guarantee a drop of the aforementioned items, but getting the items from the lesser creatures will be a much rarer occurrence.
<li>Essence of Eranikus now has a poison cloud graphic around it when used.
<li>Murloc Scale Belt and Breastplate recipes now are white items instead of green since they are vendor bought.
<li>Gryphon Mail Gauntlets now have a proper inventory icon.

<li>Small Throrium Veins now sometimes will have Emeralds or Diamonds.

Donations of cloth are now being accepted in the following locations: Darnassus, Stormwind, and Ironforge for the Alliance; Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Thunder Bluff for the Horde.

<li>Dwarven Priests may now undertake the Molten Core discovery quest: "Attunement to the Core." In fixing this bug, we had to open the quest to all players once more. If you have already done the quest, you will not be required to do it again in order to access the Molten Core via the portal.
<li>Highlord Bolvar Fordragon should no longer despawn when "The Great Masquerade" is activated.

<li>Changed the log text of the Continue to Stormwind tutorial quest, to better describe the location of Osric.

</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<pre><b>User Interface</b>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Innkeepers around the world now have a gossip option that lets you join a meeting stone directly from the innkeeper rather than going to the location of the meeting stone. Also, these innkeepers will now have background lore about each of the dungeons.

<li>Levels requirements for meeting stones have been increased. The intent is that a group will not be grouped with party members that don't really have a good chance of completing the dungeon.
<li>Meeting stones have had their rules for grouping different classes of characters relaxed. This means groups who use meeting stones (or innkeepers) should have their groups formed much more quickly than was previously happening.
<li>Pets of other party members will now display in the party UI. You can see pet health and harmful effects on the pet. You can turn this functionality on and off in the Interface Options menu.
<li>Players can now target other players in a raid by clicking on their name in the raid window. Additional Raid UI improvements coming soon.
<li>Added visual effects for healing power and spell power enchantments.
<li>Your main action bar now displays the number of the bar that you are currently displaying.

<li>When a player dies in an instance and then uses the spirit healer, the body in the instance now turns to bones.
<li>Players can no longer mail or auction an item that they've just disenchanted.
<li>When a ghost player is resurrected into an instance that has become full, they no longer come to life wherever their ghost happens to be standing. Instead, they get ported to the closest graveyard.
<li>When a player places a bag into a purchased bank bag slot, it becomes a soulbound item.
<li>Items split from stacks can now be dropped directly into (or onto) bank bags without any mysterious error messages.
<li>Added a "Maximize" windowed video option, which maximizes the game window and removes the borders for a fullscreen experience. Windowed mode still remains though, so you can access other windows.
<li>Trying to use a hearthstone, consumable, etc. while logging out now displays a more appropriate message: "Another action is in progress."
<li>The login interface files are now checked to make sure they haven't been tampered with or corrupted. This is to improve account security in public game rooms.
<li>Added the function TargetNearestPartyMember() to the UI scripting system.


</ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<pre><b>World Environment</b>
</pre>
<ul>
<li>The Thorium Brotherhood faction is now peaceful - players cannot go to war with them.
<li>The Wildhammer Clan in the Hinterlands is now a peaceful faction to the Alliance, meaning Alliance players cannot intentionally declare war on them.
<li>A new graveyard has been added near the east coast of the Hinterlands at the Overlook Cliffs.
<li>The two Hinterlands graveyards are now using a system that will ensure that the spirits of dead characters go to the closest graveyard.
<li>Buliwyf Stonehand, the dwarven weapon master in Ironforge, now properly tells you about the weapons that Woo Ping can train you in, instead of talking about himself. He does like going on about his own martial prowess.

<li>Brave Wildrunner of Bloodhoof Village in Mulgore no longer patrols through the kodo mounts.

<li>Discovering Valor's Rest now also reveals the Southwind Village puzzle
<li>Many of the epic mounts have gained eye glows and some have had other tweaks made to them to improve their appearance.

<li>Additional mithril nodes have been added in Un'Goro crater
<li>Genavie Callow in Undercity is now properly in the Undercity faction.
<li>The Grow effect that Bom'bay in Sen'jin Village would sometimes cast on characters was reduced from 100% to 50% growth.
<li>The Lazy Peons in The Valley of Trials now make a wood chopping sound when they are hacking at the trees.
<li>The Dark Summoners of the Eastern Plaguelands have finally fully materialized and are no longer ghostly in appearance.
<li>In Silverpine Forest on Fenris Island, moved a Rot Hide Plague Weaver's spawn point from inside a tree.
<li>Neeka Bloodscar of Kargath no longer speaks as if she is in the Barrens.
<li>All Forsaken NPCs are now correctly marked as humanoid to be consistent with Forsaken players.
</ul>
<p><br />
</p>

</ul>
<p><br />
</p>

<li>You will no longer be briefly flagged as in combat when enemy players release to the graveyard.
<li>Guards should no longer become permanently stuck in evade mode.
<li>The Mark of Frost is no longer cancelled by logging out.
