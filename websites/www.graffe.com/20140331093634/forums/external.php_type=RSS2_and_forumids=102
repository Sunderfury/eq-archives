			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Meh, my home desktop kicked the bucket last Sunday.  :(<br />
<br />
Power supply fried and I was hoping that would be it, but no such luck.  After replacing it, still no video.  I borrowed my wife's video card and still nothing, and I'm not getting any error code beeps at boot that would signify RAM issues, so I'm pretty certain its the motherboard.  /sigh.<br />
<br />
It was a good machine for 3-4 years though I think.  It has a Geforce 9800 in it from back when they were new if that gives any indication how old the machine was.<br />
<br />
But I guess this provided an opportunity to finally upgrade to a SSD hard drive like a couple of the threads around here keep tempting me.  :p<br />
<br />
So we went ahead and just ordered a new barebones.  Don't have the cash to go nuts on a state of the art gaming machine, but I think this will provide a substantial upgrade nonetheless.  With only brief researches, we went with:<br />
<br />
Barebones w/ AMD Fusion APU (Socket FM2)<br />
  w/ AMD APU A8-5500 (4 x 3.7GHz CPUs - plus Radeon 7560D GPU)<br />
  Asus A88XM-A<br />
  Systems - CPU Fan Only<br />
  8GB DDR3 1600MHz (1 x 8GB - Single Module)<br />
  64GB SATA3 Solid State Drive (SSD)<br />
  Standard Value Mid-Tower Case<br />
  400 Watt Power Supply<br />
  nVidia Geforce GT610 - 1GB<br />
<br />
I'll be using the CDROM and additional fans from my old system and the 650W power supply we just bought to put in this new one.<br />
<br />
Total damage was $450 through PortaTech, who I've used many times in the past with success, which seemed reasonable.<br />
<br />
I'd welcome any pro's or con's about the motherboard, processor and video card we selected if anyone has any though.<br />
<br />
I was a little concerned about how big of a pain it would be transferring my OS over using Windows 8, but holy shit, that was a welcome surprise.  A quick Google search resulted in a very easily found link that I just popped my activation code into and immediately downloaded the setup files, and it also provided the option of temporarily extracting them to a thumb drive and making it bootable.  Schweeet!<br />
<br />
Its supposed to be here late next week.<br />
<br />
:)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I tend to leave my work PC on and only reboot it once every few weeks. In that time period I tend to accumulate a lot of open apps and files. Things that I want to remember to look at or work on. We moved to a new office a few months back and since then my computer has occasionally rebooted over night. Windows Update is disabled so I think the circuit I'm on has a problem. My company needs to get me a battery backup, but in the meantime I'm trying to find something that would allow me to re-open all the last things I had going before the computer last shut down. Some Microsoft apps like Office have this, but not SQL Server Management Studio. All the browsers have this capability. You'd think Microsoft would be smart enough to make this an OS feature.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Google turned up a couple potential candidates for what I want (Twinsplay and SmartClose) but the reviews I found for them are from back before 2010. Do any of you guys know of any reliable software that you'd recommend for this?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Bittorrent is sometimes used by more legitimate corporations/organizations for distribution than it has been in the past, but I still find situations where using torrents as the preferred distribution method makes a lot of sense is not used, despite creating torrents and using torrents being extremely trivial in both cases nowadays and available on all platforms for some reasons, presumably because it is tainted by ignorance propagated by RIAA/MPAA and the ilk. It's extremely prevalent for Linux distributions as an example, but Freebsd does not provide an official torrent source for some reason for their releases, instead still wasting resources on FTP distributions as the primary method, despite that being really slow for end users. I've seeded terabytes worth of just Debian 7.4 stable isos as an example, and would have thrown up torrents for official isos with OpenBSD and FreeBSD as well on one of my servers, but they do not bother with such (OpenBSD rationalizes this as encouraging purchase of the discs as donations, which is whatever IMO). So, that is kind of a retarded waste of money nowadays. Bittorrent's one of the most revolutionary technologies of our life times and Bram Cohen is a hero genius* IMO, so it is unfortunate to see Bittorrent continued to be maligned instead of exploited as much as possible.<br />
<br />
* Cohen's one of the few people alive who are just on a different plane from the rest of the planet in their understanding of the universe, so I hate seeing him grouped with nefarious social groups instead of more generally celebrated. I do wonder what all he would have accomplished had he stayed dedicated to mathematics instead though. Bittorrent's a rare example of how extremely beneficial to technology development that open software/free software can be though as a number of really great extensions to the original protocol were made by outsiders and those have propagated to the entire ecosystem well. Generally though great execution of ideas seems to occur with developing the idea behind closed doors, which is counter intuitive to me and is against the meme that is often parroted.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Are there any non-trivial MMORPGs that are completely open to user's  developing it or hosting their own private servers, something like  Everquest except where all of the source code is available as an  example? While I do not really have much time or energy for gaming  nowadays, being able to contribute to more ambitious designs with no  external decisions would be tremendously fun, and as one benefit I could  make the game as hard and taxing on resources as I wanted to or make  really intriguing Epic Quests inspired by the ones from EQ and implement  better AI (which would likely not be more fun as a player to be  honest).<br />
<br />
And while not a MMORPG, not having to resort to utter hacks with a game like Dwarf Fortress would be brilliant as another example.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Not sure where to really put this as it is not really a hobby or a technical <br />
question, more of a rumination on an aspect of quality technical writing.<br />
<br />
What prompted this post was recently trawling through the relevant git<br />
documentation (videos, games, simulations, and written documentation), and<br />
surprisingly the most digestible learning medium I found was <a href="http://gitref.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">git<br />
reference</a>, which is surprising to me as generally reference documentation<br />
is not approachable and seemingly a skill unto itself necessary to glean<br />
information from the reference as all, especially for a reader unfamiliar with<br />
the topic entirely.<br />
<br />
An attribute I have noticed amongst documentation/tutorials is only a shallow<br />
information depth is presented, with no path to greater proficiency, or worse<br />
what information is presented is incorrect or not actionable in a real world<br />
situation.<br />
<br />
Git Reference however employs a style that is reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">literate<br />
programming</a>, and provides excellent in text citations or links for more<br />
nuanced coverage of the same material, one through the official man pages for<br />
Git and another through the excellent <a href="http://git-scm.com/book" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Git<br />
Book</a>, so where to go next and extremely detailed documentation for that<br />
exact subset of Git is readily apparent.<br />
<br />
All at once a number of events are achieved with the chosen presentation: a<br />
simplified reference with a quick overview for everyone, an interactive medium<br />
for nascent but interested readers, an index for locating information quickly<br />
online, and an direct route for more in depth learning. <br />
<br />
The Git Reference achieves all of this in an extremely terse collection of pages<br />
as well, that is much more efficient than anything else I have seen without<br />
overwhelming the audience or being too long of a document for most to get through.<br />
<br />
Git Reference's simplified overview is similar to how well the<br />
<a href="http://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simplified Common Lisp<br />
reference</a> summarizes the<br />
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Common Lisp<br />
Hyper spec</a> itself.<br />
<br />
Another brilliant component of Git Reference, is that the site's source is<br />
available on<br />
<a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github</a>, which<br />
enables the documentation to take advantage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">continuous delivery</a> concepts,<br />
crowd sources resource maintenance, makes the resource much more resilient to<br />
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bus factor</a> as well as<br />
other disasters, and enable readers to squash errata in a<br />
much shorter feedback loop; which, as someone who has found numerous errata in<br />
texts, I would have loved to have had that available so that both myself and others<br />
could be spared the pain of &quot;debugging&quot; information itself.*<br />
<br />
The Git Reference presentation can possibly improve further by taking advantage<br />
of greater immediate interactivity within the page, but doing so would introduce<br />
a lot more complexity in the process. <br />
<br />
An example that takes interactive documentation to its logical conclusion though<br />
is <a href="http://www.pharo-project.org/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pharo</a> which is mainly readily<br />
achievable because of assumptions possible about the environment the<br />
documentation will be read in, and facets of some smalltalk implementations,<br />
analogous implementations are achievable through distributing a VM itself or a<br />
much more complex web page.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few attempts at a much more visual teaching of Git, but none<br />
that I saw have either kept current with Git or were comparably in depth and<br />
none had a direct route to further learning and none were useful for quickly<br />
returning to an area where the person needed a refresher; I think there is a ton<br />
of utility in that approach but none were on the level they need to be to be a<br />
great resource sadly.<br />
<br />
One more aspect of the Git Reference tutorial which is tremendously smart is on<br />
page one, paragraph one of section two the author(s) instruct the reader to not<br />
try and map concepts from previous VCS experiences to Git itself, as that way is<br />
madness; that decision sticks out as an extremely valuable note as on<br />
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/news" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hacker News</a> very often comments on<br />
stumbling blocks to having using Git click for the poster is sourced in not<br />
having a proper mindset from the start when attempting to learn the tool.<br />
<br />
* I might add that this is especially obnoxious in construction manuals where<br />
  the end user gets to enjoy determining that steps were listed out of order for instance.</div>

</div>I am not sure what I would even include in such a course or whom to even target for the information or what portion of it to cover. &quot;Linux Professionals&quot; is extremely ambiguous as to what sort of individual the course is for. <br />
<br />
I am not sure that such a course is really the best use of time improving information access either, in part due to the low exit rate MMOCs have in reality. In general Linux and (most) of its large, mature projects are decently well documented, however as an entire ecosystem the information is really scattered compared to other technical niches, and sometimes significant sections of its documentation can lag way behind the current state with an enormous amount of effort duplication as well. * <br />
<br />
As a comparative example, the man pages in linux continue to be much less reliable than those found in OpenBSD despite the total man hours put into Linux year over year dwarfing any of the BSD efforts; I am not recommending man pages as the primary source of documentation, just mentioning it as an example where things are improvable, so no need to flame myself into oblivion about how man pages suck.<br />
<br />
Another aspect of offering the MMOC through edX is that its course offering style is much more similar to a university (although not as rigid as Coursera's in that regard), where as Udacity breaks away from that model entirely and allows anyone to participate in the course at any point. There are some behavioral drawbacks to that though, but at least personally I prefer Udacity's take on course design.<br />
<br />
* Here is a case in point: The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1593272200/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1593272200/</a>) is an excellent book, however without embracing a continuous development model for its content, the text has no hope of being up to date perpetually which is the level of curation needed for a definitive information resource.</div>
