			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>When I was in high school, I fondly remember our teachers throwing out the age-old threat of drop outs who can only find jobs that require knowledge of the phrase <i>&quot;Would you like fries with that?</i> Luckily for me, I wisely went on to college, earned my degree, and now work in a field that only occasionally asks me to speak with customers, and rarely are they idiots.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for me, I still like the fast food from time to time.  Not every night, mind you, but about once a week it is nice to simply run out for lunch and eat something unhealthy (yet tasty!) while continuing to troubleshoot some asshat programmer's shitty code.  So, about once or twice a month, I treat myself to lunch from Taco Time.<br />
<br />
For those without the heavenly goodness that is Taco Time, think Taco Bell with higher prices but much better tasting food.  While I wouldn't go so far as to call their food 'authentic' by any means, I will say that it is much closer to real mexican food than Taco Bell claims. <br />
<br />
However, every single time I go through the drive through, I'm asked no less than three times what kind of hot sauce I want.  Not *if* I want hot sauce, but *what kind* of hot sauce.<br />
<br />
I do not like hot sauce.  I feel that it ruins the natural flavour of food, seeking to only cover up a taste that you probably couldn't stand without it.  Where as things like mayonnaise and ketchup accent a taste, hot sauce tries to simply over power it.  Yet, no matter how many times I state <i>&quot;No sauce, please,&quot;</i> those minimum wage register jockeys can't get it through their fucking head that someone out there might not like their hot sauce.<br />
<br />
What's even better is that Taco Time does not serve mild hot sauce.  They have three distinct flavours; <i>Caliente (hot)</i>, <i>Picante (You really didn't want to taste food for another week anyways, right?)</i>, and the ever popular and fun to say, <i>Diablo de la Sol</i>, which translate to <i>&quot;Devil of the Sun.&quot;</i>  We also refer to this particular brand as the <i>&quot;Super Colon Raper.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
I tried <i>Diablo de la Sol</i> once, on a dare.  My sphincter still involuntarily clenches at the mere thought of the torture that shit puts you through.  I can not fathom why people would willingly put something that vile into their bodies, knowing full well what is going to happen in a few hours when it decides it's time to punish you a second time.<br />
<br />
Yet, I still love the food itself, so I put up with the incessant queries regarding my favoured choice of hot sauce.  As I said earlier, three times is the average per trip, while my personal best is six individual requests, though admittedly not from six different employees.<br />
<br />
It was during a walk in trip with some coworkers of mine.  I was the last to place my order, and had a rather complicated order.  The first was right after paying.  This one is the expected request - employees are trained to at least ask once, I presume.  I responded with my usual <i>&quot;None, thanks,&quot;</i> which satisfied the employee ringing me up.<br />
<br />
The second request came from a different employee who called me up to the counter to confirm my choice of sour cream yet no guacamole on my Natural Super Taco.  I swear it must have been simply out of reflex that he asked me, as his hand was already moving towards the cardboard bins hidden under neath the counter top.  It took him a moment to process my answer, as if he was unaccustomed to someone rejecting his hot sauce.  He didn't make a scene out of it, however, so nothing came of it.<br />
<br />
The third, fourth, and fifth requests came in a flurry as I picked up my food.  It was a third employee, young, attractive, and a complete air head. It also important to note that this particular employee was of Hispanic descent.  For maximum effect, let me transcribe the conversation, but remember it is from memory and may be a bit sketchy.<br />
<br />
Her: Hot sauce?<br />
Me: No, thanks.  <i>(At this point I'm usually irritable.  I shouldn't have to say it three fuckin' times.)</i><br />
Her: You said Picante?  <i>I see her hand darting for the packets.</i><br />
Me:  No!  No hot sauce.  None.  I. Do. Not. <i>Like.</i> Hot. Sauce.<br />
<br />
I remember emphasizing the word 'like.'  I'll admit that I sometimes speak a lot like Chandler from 'Friends' and emphasis words that really shouldn't be.  <br />
<br />
At this point the employee gets a curious look on her face, as if she, her culture, and her heritage were all insulted at once by a filthy Gringo. It was obvious that she didn't understand this concept of 'not liking hot sauce.' <br />
<br />
Her: Let me get the manager...<br />
Me: What?  Why?  Can't I just go?<br />
<br />
Up comes the original girl who rang me up.  <br />
<br />
Manager:  Is there something wrong with our hot sauce?<br />
Me:  No, I'm sure it's fine, I just don't like it.<br />
Manager:  Oh, because it's too hot?  Because 'caliente' isn't really that hot, though it say-<br />
Me:  No!  I just don't like hot sauce!  FUCK.<br />
<br />
Yes, I loudly proclaimed 'fuck' in the middle of this fast food joint, in the middle of the lunch rush, surrounded by my coworkers, and quite possibly some children who delight in not having a working asshole.<br />
<br />
I am no longer welcome at that Taco Time.  As far as I'm concerned, they can open a few of their shitty packets of 'Diablo de la Sol', shove them up their sandy vaginas, then butterfly each other until their cracks feel as bad as my asshole did the day I dared to put any of their shit on my food.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Bene playing Neverwinter Nights2, again. <br />
I@m a D&amp;D nut, so, hey ;)<br />
One thing aboutthe NWN games: it ALWAYS takes the bastards 6 months or more to patch it to make the game properly playable!! grrr.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I love arcane casters, so I played throught he add on campaign, Mask of betrayer as my wizard, after having left it on hiatus since end of last year about 1/2 way through, good fun.<br />
However, it was too esy on &quot;normal&quot; mode, where AOE's etc don't hit your party.<br />
<br />
So, started up my warlock again, but, found he had too few skill points for what I wanted, especially spellcraft which gives you the Epic spells (Mass Fowl, AOE polymorph to chicken spell...I <i>have </i>to have it :evil:)<br />
<br />
So, I restarted game, made him lvl 1 thief with 16 int and charisma, very handy to pick locks etc, and eventually I'll give him another rogue level, so he gets evasion.<br />
<br />
Note the Dark One's Own Luck spell warlocks get gives them a massive saving throw bonus (bonus is = to their Charisma bonus and Chrisma is their prime stat) So, combine that with Evasion and you can laugh at AOES! Muhaha!<br />
Also it fits the character, madcap but good guy. Nothing like me, obviously *cough* :p<br />
Well, I'm far too Lawful anyway, always end up bloody 100/100 lawful good, normally, and since 3.5 ed warlocks HAVE to be chaotic good, neutral, or evil, have ot keep going for the Chaotic choices.<br />
I disagree with the developers though, in that why the hell does lie/bluff have to be mostly the only Chaotic choices?<br />
Many some what chaotic cultures, say, the VIkings, were absolute on personal honesty.<br />
I digress....<br />
<br />
<br />
Some various tips:<br />
<br />
1) *KEEP* all the gems and (non-iron) ingots you find. Crafting your own magic items from gems/metals/rare meaterials is the best way to make superb gear, or to make lots of cash to pay for upgrading your keep in ACT 2<br />
you can buy lots form merchants, too, you find ore dotted aorund in zones, click on it and when you get Crossroads Keep, a miner can give you some of the refined ore.<br />
<br />
Duskwood longbows; adamantine full plate; mithril full plate; zalantar light shields; all sell for a ton, like 8k to 10,000 gp! <br />
if you use up the crappy essences and obsidain to make them +1 magic, it adds about 2k to the price.<br />
<br />
2) Best armour to make for light/medium armour characters with high dex is Mithril breastplate. Awesome stuff, counts as Light amrour.<br />
This site has all the recipes for magic crafting:<br />
<a href="http://www.thieves-guild.net/index.php?pid=45" target="_blank">http://www.thieves-guild.net/index.php?pid=45</a><br />
For my main PC warlock, I make it +5, and give it the &quot;Fortification&quot; effect, making you immune to critical hits and sneak attacks (damned good!)<br />
Also great for Neeshka the rogue, Grobnar or others.<br />
<br />
Adamantine plate is best for characters with high strength and low dexterity.<br />
it adds damage reduction 3/-, so every weapon attack does 3hp less to them...which adds up to a lot in a fight.<br />
addign fire resist is nice to, as it's some what common attack effect.<br />
<br />
3) best melee weapons are IMHO:<br />
-adamantine, and vampiric OR holy, i go for vampiric. Adamantine ignores the damage reduction of Stoneskin and similar spells which NPC casters use a lot.<br />
Vampiric is awesome, keeping characters healing slightly on every hit.<br />
And since most enemies are evil, the holy effect does 2d6hp to 'em.<br />
Note that since adamantine adds an extra +2 magic damage, adamantine weapons can only take a total of 3 enchantments (and it takes one more enchantment to add the + bonus to the weapon, remember), as there's a 4 enchantment limit to items, unless you are an Epic character.<br />
<br />
-Alchemical silver, the shadow reavers, and devils have damage reduction that's beaten by silver.<br />
make this weapon have vampiric <i>and </i>holy. Vampiric regenerates your character a few hit points on every successful hit, which is awesome.<br />
<br />
If you want ot use other effects, I'd suggest acid, not much is resistant to acid. Fire and acid are the only things that will finish off a troll by the way.<br />
<br />
4) For warlocks, the best spells to take are:<br />
lvl 1: <b>Dark One's Own Luck</b>, for big save bonus, helps a lot.<br />
<b>Entropic Shield</b>, all ranged attacks, including spells like Melf's Acid arrow and Disintegrate (!) have a 20% chance to miss.<br />
<b>See The Unseen</b>, as a number of nasty enemy spellcasters use invisibility spells, which this can see through.<br />
<br />
lvl 2 <br />
<b>Eldritch Chain</b>, this is a BEAUTY! on a successful hit, your Eldritch Blast attack can chain onto other enemies, muhaha!<br />
<b>Flee The Scene</b> A Haste you can cast as often as you want...wow!<br />
<b>brimstone Blast</b> Turns Eldritch blast into fire damage, does extra damage. <br />
<br />
lvl 3<br />
<b>Noxious Blast</b> Lovely! living creatures who fail a save are dazed for 10 rounds. They are unable to move or attack, and thus easy meat! Note that Daze does not allow sneak attacks (sneak attacks require the victim to be flanked, blind/stun or paralyzed) or coup de grace (requires paralyzed, fyi)<br />
<b>Vitriolic Blast </b>This is vital!!! It turns eldritch blast into acid that ignores spell resistance completely. So this is the only way to use eldritch blast on golems (totally spell resistant bastards), or on high magic resist beasties like dragons and demons/devils.<br />
<b>Tenacious Plague</b> very evil spell, muhaha! summons a horde of swarming bugs to damage the foe. lasts 3 rounds. Note it will hit your own party if they are in target area on <i>casting</i>, so make sure to target foes away from party, the swarm will follow them if they move. Each swarm does 2d6 magic damage and you get one per 3 levels. they get a attack bonus of +4 and double your charisma bonus, so since my guy has very high charisma, that's a +20 attack, and 6 swarms for potentail of 36d6 damage ..not to be sniffed at!<br />
no use though if you don't boost Charisma, as you should (it's vital for the class)<br />
<br />
note the druid version, Creping Doom is 1 swarm per 2 levels...so very nasty indeed!<br />
<br />
lvl4<br />
Retributive Invisibility 3 round improved invisibility, as often as you want, awesome! 50% chane enemies will miss you.<br />
<br />
Forget name of other abilites that rock at this level.<br />
<br />
A blast that makes enemies stunend for 1 round is good if you have a  rogue (neeshka) in the party, as she'll get free sneak attacks, which are brutal damage.<br />
<br />
An effect that turns your eldrtich blast into an AOE, great for blowing up big bunches of mooks.<br />
<br />
A variant of stoneskin that givesy ou damage reduction only beaten by cold iron weapons, which are very rare so you'll get a lot of help with this power, believe me.<br />
<br />
if you have it on Normal, by the way, the <b>chilling tentacles</b> ability is REALLY bad ass! it's like an Evard's Black Tentacles you can cast every round, that does extra cold damage, eek!<br />
<br />
4) Best item hands down for a warlock is a +8 Nymph Cloak (which you will need ot make yourself), you really need ot get charisma up high!<br />
Note that the <b>Use Magic Device</b> is a class skill warlocks get, and have a bonus to it as well, keep this skill quite high, this lets oyu wear monk boots that give big dodge bonuses, and special priestly/alignment based belts used by clerics (Shar's belt of midnight, iirc).<br />
Since you have great use Magic Device, using scrolls of summon monster, Mass Heal etc are great idea. you can do crowd control, protect your ass or heal an about to die hero, etc.<br />
I like Shapechange, haha! turn into a frost giant etc and <i>kick butt for goodness!</i><br />
<br />
5) Concentration, Bluff, Use magic Device and maybe Diplomacy, TUmble are great skills for warlocks.<br />
<br />
6) You are best thinking of yourself as sort of crowd control/damage dealer. <br />
The enemy AI is such that they will bee line straight for your ass, so having summoned minions (from you or others) helps get in their way, and your eldritch blasts that can blind, stun or daze help a lot in this.<br />
<br />
note that the way the AI works,if an enemy spellcaster or archer is hit with a persistant AOE, like wall of fire (warlocks get a version of it), they will usually run into melee, which is better than being hit by a Meteor Swarm spell, isn't it? :D<br />
<br />
Also, if you do not have a see invisibility ability or true seeing item, you cannot directly target invisible enemies..but you CAN hit them with AOEs targetted close by ;)<br />
<br />
Wizard and druid spell Wall of Fire does double damage to the undead! this means it does truly brutal damage to your main foes in end stage of game, I'd suggest making a Wand of Wall of Fire, if you cna afford it, for your warlock or another to toast enemy attacks...</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I remember the first time I used craigslist.<br />
<br />
I was selling an amp I had bought the previous year and used twice: A Marshall Min-Stack. Cute as hell and plenty loud for rehearsals but frankly unfit for digital recording or live performance.<br />
<br />
Guitar Center was of course perfectly willing to give me trade in credit for it; a trifle that amounted to the tax I had originally paid on it the year before. Because I am not a moron I decided to take my salesmanship to the streets and off the thing on craigslist. After all -- I wanted my new amp: a Line 6 Spider 90 watt combo amp ASAP. Craig and I were a match made in heaven. I wrote an ad seeking a local buyer who wanted a &quot;Mini Version&quot; of their current Marshall setup; possibly for a child or a teacher.<br />
<br />
I got a response back from a local guy within 20 minutes, and we exchanged phone numbers and information. Within 4 hours he had a cherry amp for his son to match dads, and I had almost 90% of what I had paid for the amp originally in cash. By the end of that same day, I had my new spider and I wasn't out of pocket for a dingle thin dime.<br />
<br />
What a world, right?<br />
<br />
Gone was the ridiculous lag time inherent in an EBAY transaction. Gone were the numerous and sundry listing fees, shipping hassles and fake buyers. I had accomplished a cash transaction over a starbucks mocha and BOTH parties were extremely happy. Better still -- we did the local thing in less then a day, rather then hope and pray and run a 7 day auction. Life was fucking sweet.<br />
<br />
In the years since I have done several craigslist deals, and in truth -- I have come to rely on &quot;craigs&quot; for a lot of things; anonymous (and paid for) sex aside. I am here now to inform thee my breddahs... Dem days are done.<br />
<br />
The craigslist of 2005 has been co-opted by every manner of amateur scam artist barfed up from the lower hells. Few if any ads are truly local these days, no matter what they say in the ad itself. Almost no one lists their phone number or email address. Every ad is constructed by a marketing bot for the purpose of scamming credit card numbers or items in exchange for phony money orders and rubber checks from banks that never existed. <br />
<br />
I have spent the better part of a week scouring both Denver and Colorado Springs craigslist listings for a Macbook or Macbook Pro. Most never answer back, and the ones that do are so obviously scams that I have to wonder what kind of person would ever fall for them in the first place. A $450 Macbook Pro in the UK, baby -- just wire funds or send cash and I'll drop it in the mail right away -- I'll even pay for the shipping! hur hur hur!<br />
<br />
I tend to word my response in such a way as to show that I am not a bot, that I am local, and that I have cash in hand to do the deal ASAP. The replies I get are not even half hearted attempts at theft; like a digital Dillinger with no sense of style, and no education beyond what can be picked up after a few summers talking smack on X-Box live.<br />

The product is in great condition and runs great , no scratches, no special marks, no need for additional repairs , it is like new and still under warranty .The reason I am selling it , is because I am in the military and my unit will be sent back to Iraq for a mission that will take 6 months and I don't want to keep it .I am selling it so low because I need to sell it before August 24st.<br />
I already have tones of emails so I hope you understand that I need to sort them out and I hope you won't make me loose time as it has already happened to me. If you will decide to buy it I am willing to pay for the shipping costs .If you are still interested e-mail me back.

<li>Retired Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller said she had no &quot;off-limits&quot; foods</li>
<li>Nutritionists say athletes need to view food as fuel</li>
<li>Men and women have different views of food, expert says</li>
</ul><br />
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- If carb-loading were an Olympic competition, U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps would probably medal there, too. His day starts with three cheese-tomato-onion-fried egg sandwiches, an omelet, three powdered-sugar-covered slices of French toast, a bowl of grits and three chocolate chip pancakes to top it off, according to news reports.<br />
<br />
Phelps told reporters earlier this week he was instructed to eat between 8,000 and 10,000 calories every day. Other news reports put the total as high as 12,000 calories.<br />
<br />
This sounds extreme, even to some dietitians. But Olympic athletes' nutritional needs do vary widely according to their sports and body sizes, and swimming for long periods of time will naturally burn a lot of calories, experts told CNN.<br />
<br />
Phelps' intake is just what his appetite requires, said Nancy Clark, a sports nutritionist in Boston, Massachusetts.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's a limousine, he's tall. A limousine needs more gas than a Mini Cooper,&quot; said Clark, who has worked with Olympic athletes. &quot;Hunger is simply a request for fuel.&quot; <br />
<br />
Different sports need different amounts of fuel, she said. Gymnastics, for example, &quot;doesn't require so much caloric expenditure,&quot; she said, and those athletes generally eat less than some others. They also tend to be smaller physically.<br />
<br />
Shannon Miller, 31, the most decorated gymnast in U.S. history and winner of seven Olympic medals, told CNN Friday that she didn't have any &quot;off-limits&quot; foods while in training. Her breakfast would be two waffles with butter and syrup, and her working parents would order Chinese food or pizza once a week. <br />
<br />
&quot;I knew I needed to eat in order to have energy, but at the time I really didn't think about it too scientifically,&quot; she said. &quot;It was very simple: If I was hungry, I ate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miller retired after her medal-winning performance at the 1996 Olympics. She attempted a comeback in the 2000 Olympic trials but injured herself. She will perform in the 2008 Tour of Olympic Superstars.<br />
<br />
&quot;After I retired, I immediately hit puberty and it was tough. My entire body changed,&quot; she said. &quot;I went from working out over 40 hours a week to nothing, and kept eating the same amount of food. It took some time, but I figured out an 'everything in moderation approach' that works for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, Miller said she didn't think too much about her eating habits when she was training. She enjoys eating, and had favorite and least favorite foods.<br />
<br />
Clark described a typical gymnast's daily menu: a breakfast of cereal, milk and a banana; a lunch of a sandwich and soup; snacks of trail mix, energy bars and fruit; and a dinner of chicken, rice and vegetables.<br />
<br />
A weight lifter, Clark said, would eat the same kinds of things, but in larger quantities and with more of a focus on protein. Add eggs and yogurt to the gymnast's breakfast, and multiply the portions of all of the meals -- piles of rice, vegetables and two or three pieces of chicken for dinner.<br />
<br />
Long-distance runners also have high-calorie needs, said Tara Gidus, dietician for the Orlando Magic NBA team and owner of Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting in Orlando, Florida. She recommends liquids -- smoothies, fruit juices, sweetened juices -- to deliver those calories so that athletes don't have to eat something every hour. Nuts and nut-butters are also dense in energy, she said.<br />
<br />
Dinner for the long-distance runner would be carbs -- potatoes, rice, bread -- with some protein -- salmon, chicken, lean beef -- and vegetables mixed in, she said. Antioxidants are key because athletes produce a lot of free radicals, which can result in cell damage.<br />
<br />
Gidus discourages athletes from eating foods dripping in fat. But an egg fried in olive oil instead of butter or mayonnaise without saturated fat on a sandwich would be good sources of calories, she said.<br />
<br />
Female athletes tend to view food as fattening, while males want to know how they can get more fuel, Clark said. Even at the Olympic level, weight is a big issue among gymnasts, divers and sports runners, she said.<br />
<br />
Gidus is more skeptical of Phelps' diet, especially if he maintains a 10,000-calorie diet during competitions. She finds it hard to believe that he needs or eats that many calories.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ten-thousand calories can actually cause him to get bogged down a little bit,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Most female athletes should get between 2,000 and 3,000 calories, while male athletes should get 3,000 to 5,000, Clark said.<br />
<br />
A petite gymnast probably wouldn't eat a fifth of what Phelps does -- but he is still getting the carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals that he needs, Clark said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a saying that the best athletes have the junkiest diets,&quot; she said. &quot;The best athletes are really genetically gifted. They tend to eat and enjoy it.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm not much into &quot;cape crusader!&quot; type heroes, and I while I like Heroes (season1 anyway), I like imagining more, oh, mundane things that would occur with such powers, ie, what would happen if you or me, got them, and have them a tad more &quot;realistic&quot; (lol, well, you know what I mean).<br />
<br />
Now, imagine the following scenario/powers/limits., Apply to yourself or somoene else, and think about it:<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; width: 100%;">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Quote:</div>
	<table cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td class="alt2">
			<hr />
			
				1) The person has the ability to &quot;heal&quot; themselves and others, in truth, what it is, is accelerating growth, natural healing and in a manner that's beyond the natural, ie, when done well, no scars etc. <br />
but NOT like the cheerleader from Heroes ;)<br />
<br />
The person with this power has a degree of conscious control over it, and in fact can do more than merely heal.<br />
He/she can &quot;see&quot; in a way, how the entire body, or any part/system, works, can work on it, improve or even alter it (within biological limits, see below)<br />
<br />
2) The effectiveness of this ability, is based off the person's intelligence (oprecision and understanding), empathy (helps literally link and comprehending the other person's body responses) and experience in using this power. So over time, they cna grow better at it.<br />
In effect, risks are at +10% for 1st month of it's use, -5% after 1st year.<br />
Low intelligence/empathy increases risks +10% for each, high inteligence/empathy reduces risks 5% each (intelligence, empathy are of course, highly variable, I'm just giving the higher ends of the scales).<br />
<br />
Also, since empathy is an issue, the person's likes/dislikes DO come into play.<br />
Thus a racist using their power on somone they hate, would uffer an additional +10% or more risk, depending on the strength of their hate.<br />
<br />
Onthe other hand, empathy for specially loved people, does help, adding up to +5% help.<br />
<br />
However, no risk on serious undertakings can be lower than 1%...it's never risk free, apart from minor help (like closing a cut that would take a few stitches, poses no risk).<br />
<br />
The act of healing takes time, longer for more extreme uses. HaEaling a cut less than a minute, regenerating a limb an hour or more. Body alterations 3+ hours.<br />
<br />
Healing can be done on unwilling/unconcious people, major changes alterations cannot, it requires their co-operation.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) It can have consequences. The more extensive the healing or alterations the higher the risks.<br />
A minor healing or minor infection, worst risk is merely making the patient unwell for a day or two.<br />
However, beyond that, a risk of death or other permanent harm does come into play. The harm maybe poor or non-function of the limb/organ, pain, scarring, death or cancer.<br />
-Regenerating a hand/foot has a 5% chance of harm; arm from elbow down 10%, whole arm 15%, entire leg 20%, as rough guides (complexity is less of an issue than mass)<br />
-Severe burns, necrosis or other damage that's destroyed things at cellular level also needs regeneration.<br />
-The older/sicker perosn is, higher risks too. If young and fit, no additonal risk, but a very aged would have +10% risk, a middle aged man with a bad heart 10%, an old, feeble perosn 20% and if they are dying 30% or more depending on severity of damage.<br />
-organ/limb regeneration takes time, several days for a finger, 2 months for a leg. The patient is very hungry during this time, using food to build the missing mass.<br />
<br />
4) This power will work on non-humans too, but, there is higher risk of harm, and the risk increases the further from human it gets, and also the person's empathy with them.<br />
For example, a primate adds 5% risk, canine/cat 10%, lizard 15%.<br />
An arachnophobe for example would have a huge penalty -50% on trying to cure a spider :p<br />
<br />
5) This power does work on the user themselves, with much less chance of risk, -10%, also, the perosn's subconcious does trigger it to heal them when unconcious etc.<br />
<br />
6) This ability can undo aging, but only to an extent, 70% reduction, for other people, 90% if used on the person with this ability themself.<br />
This is a major work and thus has a 10% risk on others, 5% on the person themselves.<br />
Since it relies largely on the person it's being used on's own tissues/DNA, aging causes errors/problems and so it cannot be entirely undone.<br />
<br />
7) Minor wounds heal in seconds or a few minutes, thus it can prevent death from injury, but it cannot bring back the dead, and a fatal wound may perhaps not be treatable in time.<br />
For example, a stab causes a cut in an artery, a small wound (there's little actual tissues destroyed or lost), could close up and prevent death, but a gunshot wound that's destroyed tissues, cause shock, requires more major work and the chances are highly variable.<br />
In general though, this treatment is more effective than conventional medicine, but could certianly work <i>alongside </i>normal medical methods, to the betterment of both.<br />
<br />
8) Body alterations can be done, even extreme ones, however, these must fall within biological limits of the creature  and can be very risky.<br />
For example, you could actually change man to a woman, or a small man to a tall one, such is like regeneration, takes time, also requires the person's willing help as it cannot be done on an unwilling person, they have to actual help you form the body they wish in their mind.<br />
Risks from this can be severe, up to 40% for complete radical change,<br />
<br />
Sex change is 25% risk. However, this only gives the physical make up, since the perosn's DNA cannot change with this ability, they mayhave functional genitalia, but their testes/ovaries cannot be converted to their opposite.<br />
<br />
height change 10% (note, you can only change a person up to '1 taller, beyond that it's outside their nature and would incur 25% risk. and max of +2 feet, and they could suffer health problems, anyway from size).<br />
<br />
9) The <i>Mind </i>cannot be altered, but damage to the brain can be undone. This includes birth or genetic flaws, such as psychopathy.<br />
<br />
10) Genetic defects can be undone, but these count as major changes, and inccur a 40% risk for adults, 30% for children 20% for newborns, 15% for in the womb (the user can actully affect the child in the womb if mother is willing).<br />
<br />
11) Non-malignant, small cancers can be treated with no risk in 30 minutes or so. Otherwise, the risks can be up to 20% for very extensive, highly aggresive and otherwise fatal cancer and that could take 3 hours.

Now, imagine a person/self with that power. What do you think may unfold?<br />
<br />
I cna imagine lots of things:<br />
<br />
a) Having to deal with possible harm or even death of those you help. Docs must deal with that often and it must be very hard on them :(<br />
But, you could do many things to help people.<br />
<br />
b) Badgered and harried by people desperate for cures, making life a nightmare.<br />
<br />
c) Kidnapped by powerful/malicious people to preserve their life, form billionaires to drug dealers.<br />
Or, for sheer greed, offering yourservices for the highest pay.<br />
<br />
d) Atacks in the press etc from skeptical extrmists and health profesisonals (either genuinely thinking you're a charlatan, or bigotry or not wanting their livelyhood interferred with)<br />
<br />
e) You cannot heal everyone. Who do you choose ot help? <br />
generally, of course, you'd like to help children, so they can have a full life, but the single parent of several children if not treated...well, that could result in their chidlren's lives being ruined.<br />
So it's not simple.<br />
This power does not come with a &quot;User&quot; or &quot;ethics&quot; manual ;)<br />
<br />
f) You could be &quot;co-opted&quot; by the government, like it or not, to regulate your ability and access to it. This could be benign, or not, depending onwhere you reisde etc. It may also chaff, even if benign.<br />
You'd probably need armed guards by them for rest of your life, either to control you, or to protect you from merciless folk who'd monopolize you.<br />
<br />
g) Would you/they be a scumbag, and treat only those who offer the most?<br />
This power may not be in the hands of a saint, after all.<br />
<br />
h) Would you be studied, or abused, or even harmed/killed ot learn of your power?<br />
<br />
I) what if thise power could be replicated? Given to another person/s, or clones of you etc.<br />
What if it turned out to be spiritual ability rather than some peculiar mutation? wouldnt' that set the cat amongst the pigeons :evil:<br />
<br />
j) What if religious extremists used you as an icon, or kidnapped you, or some nutbag with this pwoer willingly became the leader of some mad cult or jihad.<br />
Someone with this power could claim to be Jesus reborn, and oh boy, wouldn't that be &quot;fun&quot; if they were also a psychopath...ick.<br />
<br />

				July 30, 2008<br />
<br />
The Immigrant and Customs Enforcement agency started a new program giving &quot;fugitive&quot; illegal immigrants a chance to turn themselves in. &quot;Fugitive&quot; illegal immigrants consist of only 3% of total illegal immigrants and have no criminal history and have failed to leave after receiving a final order of deportation. While the program begins, some question the efficacy of a program essentially asking for self-deportation. <br />
<br />
According to the Pew Hispanic Center there are over 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. Only 457,000 of those aliens have recieved final orders of deportation and therefore are considered &quot;fugitives&quot;.<br />
<br />
ICE's new &quot;Operation Scheduled Departure&quot; is giving the immigrants who have received these deportation orders 90 days to turn themselves in or leave the United States.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will allow them a little bit of control over the removal process that ultimately will come for each and every one of them,&quot; says Jim Hayes, ICE's acting director for detention and removal operations.  <br />
<br />
ICE officials say illegal immigrants can instead deport themselves voluntarily without being arrested or detained. They say it's advantageous to make deportation arrangements without being held in custody.<br />
<br />
The program got underway this morning in five cities including Phoenix and will run until August 22nd.<br />
<br />
Illegal immigrants who live in or near Phoenix, San Diego, Santa Ana, California, Charlotte and Chicago can go to their local ICE offices to discuss plans to depart the United States.<br />
<br />
A hot topic in Southern Arizona, this new &quot;volunteer deportation&quot; program  has many scratching their heads. Joseph Beamon is one of them who says not many illegal immigrants will turn themselves in. &quot;Cause that's ridiculous. Yeah, that's crazy. I wouldn't do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel Wilson is an immigration attorney who says the program is an obscure idea. &quot;If they want to go back home, they could just go on their own.  There's no need to go through the government process what so ever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wilson says the undocumented immigrants she's worked with risked so much to get here, not turning themselves in is a chance most illegal immigrants are willing to take. &quot;It seems like it might even make more work for the government.  I'm not sure who this program benefits at all actually. It's just another symptom of how broken our immigration system is.&quot;<br />
<br />
According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement there are 572,000 ICE fugitives in our country including 457,000 who don't have criminal histories. There is a total of 12 million illegal immigrants according to the Pew Hispanic Center, so fugitives only consitute 3% of total illegal immigrants.

Be careful from this point forward, if you disable the wrong services, you can hose your system.<br />
3) double-click on Administrative Templates, and then open Printers.<br />
4) On the right side of the window, look for &quot;Disallow installation of printers using kernel-mode drivers&quot;<br />
5) Open up that service, and set its status to disabled.<br />
6) Install your 2000/XP Printer Driver.<br />

Just remember, you're sacrificing stability for a working printer.</div>

Bit of late notice, but I'm heading up to Boston for Saturday for a Sox game, and will also be there Sunday.  I'm looking for 'must see' places to visit, food to eat, etc.<br />
<br />
Currently I think we'll be doing (or have heard of these at least):<br />
<br />
-Sam Adams, &lt;3 beer<br />
-Green Dragon<br />
-Flask &amp; Flagon bar?<br />
-Freedom Trail<br />
-Old North Chuch &amp; maybe some Italian restaurants in the area?<br />
-Possibly a place called Jillian's (sp?)?<br />
 <br />
And possibly something else if the g/f has cooked something up.  I'm a bit of a sucker for American / Revolutionary history, so I'm sure to soak up plenty of that.<br />
<br />
Just looking for some suggestions from folks that either live in the area, or have visited somewhere / eaten something / (drank a certain beer! :D) that should definitely be checked out!<br />
<br />
Thanks for any ideas.</div>
