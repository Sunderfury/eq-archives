Rand only cared about herself, utterly and totally: she was quite literally, unabashedly, evil.</div></div><hr />

Randian Objectivism is a like a stupid cult with the intellectual and moral strength of a high school junior.<br />
<br />
Fuck people who take Rand seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonas</div><div class="date">January 28th, 2011, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think she makes a couple good points about the extreme case in her writings, while being at times somewhat entertaining. I'm not so sure that she herself lived that way, the kinds of people she described are a few in a generation. The rest of us pleebs need a bail out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alikat Astrae</div><div class="date">January 28th, 2011, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that she was recovering her own money from the government's prior collection of taxes for those programs.  I find Ayn Rand to be a lousy person with a rotten philosophy, but she DID work in the USA from the late 1920's until the 1970's, and she DID pay social security and Medicare taxes, so she'd have been an utter and complete fool not to have filed to get HER OWN MONEY BACK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remfin</div><div class="date">January 28th, 2011, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SS I'll give you (what relevance this has with her own words condemning what she did I don't know), but are you actually sure she paid into Medicare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alikat Astrae</div><div class="date">January 28th, 2011, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, she was working in the USA since 1926, when she was 21 years old.  She worked at screen writing jobs, in a movie studio costume department, and, until much later, when she became famous enough to live off of her writing and lecturing exclusively, she, like most professional novelists, had been working at various day jobs for most of her adult life, IN ADDITION TO her writing.<br />
<br />
So yeah, she'd been paying into Medicare for about a decade when she got sick.  She continued to pay into Medicare until her death in 1982, via the self-employment tax.  I have no idea whether or not she got more out of the system than she paid in, but she did indeed pay into both Social Security and Medicare since their inception.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
She filed under the name &quot;Ann O'Connor,&quot; and she was married to Frank O'Connor, so the surname was perfectly legitimate.  I assume that there was no fraud if she filed under her own social security number.<br />
 <br />
I find it funny that I despise the woman and her work, yet in the interest of fairness I think accusing her of hypocrisy for filing for SSi and Medicare in 1974 when she was a 69-year-old cancer sufferer who had been paying federal and state taxes for her entire adult life is quite unfair.  The government had her money and she needed it badly.  That is not hypocrisy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silverblade-T-E</div><div class="date">January 28th, 2011, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no, she had the legal right to claim back what she was legally entitled to, as it were, but that does not mean she was not a hypocrit or near-sociopath, which she bloody was, lol.<br />
<br />
oh, and IF she paid her taxes fairly, and, let's be honest, given her track record, do you think she did? that would make it even worse.</div></div><hr />

No I don't think that was her real name.  If Ann O'Connor was her real name then all is good and no fraud. <br />
I do find it hypocritical to say no one should take any money/bad if you do then go and take it yourself.  I have no doubt she paid into both funds but did she really need the money?  The quote above made it seem she took the money to save her own.</div></div><hr />

That's exceptionally charitable.</div></div><hr />

Both programs are government assistance which she supposedly despised.  Complete hypocrite.</div></div><hr />

First off ssi and medicaid despite what people think is not ever your own money.  Your money bought grandma a new hip and grandpa his heart medication congradufuckinglations.  The poor suckers working now always foot the bill so what she was in fact spending was other peoples hard earned money.  Perhaps she should have commited suicide to save people the trouble of paying for her.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Actually, if she used the Social Security number that was legally issued to her long before she was even married, then she would not be committing fraud even if she filed under the name of &quot;Bebe Rebozo.&quot;  It's the Social Security number that is your legal tax ID, not your name.</div></div><hr />

 I get a statement from Social Security every year that tells me how much I've contributed so far and what my benefits will be if I retire at certain ages.  Looks to me as if it's a pension plan that was fully funded in advance, but that up-front funding has been &quot;borrowed&quot; and replaced with US Bonds so that the federal government could spend money they didn't actually have.<br />
 <br />
I think your notion of how Social Security works is sort of cute, it's so primitive and uninformed.</div></div><hr />
