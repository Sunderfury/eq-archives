<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Apple's official statement on the EU ruling against its Irish tax arrangements tells you all you need to know about what is at stake: You can have taxes, or you can have jobs, but Apple is in no mood to deliver both. <br />
<br />
After learning this morning that  the EU expects Apple to pay €13 billion (£11 billion, $14.5 billion) in back taxes, the company said, &quot;it will have a  profound and harmful effect on investment and job creation in Europe.&quot; <br />
<br />
That is not a threat, technically. But it will be seen as one by EU politicians who want to attract new companies to their countries.  <br />
<br />
Back in 1991, Apple struck a tax deal with Ireland that was completely above-board and legal. The Irish government provided Apple with a &quot;comfort letter&quot; that said if it based its European operations in Ireland, it would pay very low rates of tax. <br />
<br />
In the 15 years since, Apple has created thousands of jobs in Ireland. By  2015 it had 5,000 employees in the country. Another  1,000 jobs are planned for the HQ in Cork. This year,  Apple will open its Athenry site, with another 200 jobs in the making.  <br />
<br />
The deal between Apple and Ireland was pretty clear: Give us low taxes and we will give you jobs.  A note from a meeting between the government and an Apple tax advisor in 1990 basically said exactly that: <br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			&quot;Apple was now the largest employer in the Cork area with 1,000 direct employees and 500 persons engaged on a subcontract basis. It was stated that the company is at present reviewing its worldwide operations and wishes to establish a profit margin on its Irish operations.&quot;
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Apple is now the single largest taxpayer in Ireland, so it has the kind of negotiating strength to get what it wants.  <br />
<br />
Apple has noted that its tax arrangements were agreed to repeatedly by Ireland's government. The European Commission itself says the agreements were legal, albeit mistaken. But Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, made Apple's Irish tax arrangements sound like a scam: <br />
<br />
<ul><li style=""> Apple's effective European tax rate was 1%, on sales of €16 billion or more per year.</li><li style=""> It sunk as low as  0.005% in 2014.</li><li style=""> Apple created a head office that did not exist: &quot;This 'head office' had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business, or any other substantive business for that matter. ... The 'head office' did not have any employees or own premises.&quot;</li><li style=""> The pact deprived other European countries of billions of euros in unpaid taxes. </li></ul><br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps the most serious part of Vestager's case against Apple is the way it contradicts Apple's longstanding assertion that it does not pay corporation taxes in the US because its foreign (i.e. non-American) revenues are reinvested in the foreign territories that earn them.  Apple's annual report has said, &quot;substantially all of the Company’s undistributed international earnings intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. were generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, which has a statutory tax rate of 12.5%.&quot;  <br />
<br />
That 12.5% rate appears to have been Irish mist. The European money was actually being funnelled back to the US, Vestager says. Apple's Irish operations had a cost-sharing agreement with the US HQ  in which they were allowed to use Apple's intellectual property if, in return, they paid for the American R&amp;D expenses to create that IP. The EC statement says: <br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			&quot;Under this agreement, Apple Sales International and Apple Operations Europe make yearly payments to Apple in the US to fund research and development efforts conducted on behalf of the Irish companies in the US. These payments amounted to about US$ 2 billion in 2011 and significantly increased in 2014. These expenses, mainly borne by Apple Sales International, contributed to fund more than half of all research efforts by the Apple group in the US to develop its intellectual property worldwide.&quot;
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>(Critics may also ask how many more jobs would have been created in Europe if the money generated in Europe had actually stayed in Europe.) <br />
<br />
Vestager's ruling will also be read as a threat by dozens of other international companies who previously used Europe's flexible tax arrangements. The European Commission concluded in October 2015 that Luxembourg and the Netherlands granted tax advantages to Fiat and Starbucks. It is currently investigating Amazon and McDonald's. <br />
<br />
The ruling will be appealed. It will be years before it is resolved. It won't hurt Apple — the €13 billion in unpaid tax is roughly equivalent to only one month's revenue, and Apple has always kept a massive amount of cash stashed in foreign countries precisely because it does not want to move it into jurisdictions where it might be taxed. <br />
<br />
The more immediate problem is whether global companies will even bother with Ireland in the future if they cannot get the tax breaks they want ... and whether that, in the long term, will reduce the total tax take in Europe. <br />
<br />
With that in mind, Apple published a longer statement this morning, reiterating the link between jobs and taxes: <br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Beyond the obvious targeting of Apple, the most profound and harmful effect of this ruling will be on investment and job creation in Europe. Using the Commission’s theory, every company in Ireland and across Europe is suddenly at risk of being subjected to taxes under laws that never existed. <br />
<br />
... We are committed to Ireland and we plan to continue investing there, growing and serving our customers with the same level of passion and commitment.

			SAN DIEGO &#8212; A California judge has rejected a request by physicians to immediately suspend a new state law allowing terminally ill people to end their lives.<br />
<br />
Judge Daniel A. Ottolia of Riverside County Superior Court ruled on Friday that the law would remain in effect for now. But he agreed to allow the physicians to pursue their lawsuit claiming that the law lacks safeguards against abuse.<br />
<br />
The law, which took effect on June 9, allows terminally ill adults to obtain a prescription for life-ending medication if a doctor has determined they have no more than six months to live.<br />
<br />
Supporters of the law have argued that terminally ill people could face prolonged, painful deaths if it is suspended.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth Wallner, a Sacramento resident with Stage 4 colon cancer who attended the hearing, said she had cried with relief when the judge denied the motion to suspend the law.<br />
<br />
&#8220;I want to have the ability to control the end of life and protect my child from watching me be tortured to death,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It just gave me an immeasurable sense of peace.&#8221;<br />
<br />
California is one of five states where terminally ill people may legally receive assistance to end their lives. Oregon became the first to provide the option in 1997.<br />
<br />
The California law is being challenged by the Life Legal Defense Foundation, the American Academy of Medical Ethics and several physicians.<br />
<br />
Opponents of the law say that hastening death is morally wrong, that the law puts all kinds of patients at risk of loved ones&#8217; coercing them to end their lives, and that it could become a way out for people who are not insured or who fear high medical bills.<br />
<br />
Stephen G. Larson, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said his clients wanted the law declared unconstitutional. Determining when someone has six months or less to live is arbitrary and opens the door for abuse, he said, and doctors are not held accountable after they prescribe the life-ending drugs.<br />
<br />
&#8220;There are plenty of cases of elderly people suffering and people just want them gone,&#8221; Mr. Larson said. &#8220;This makes it too easy.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The state attorney general&#8217;s office countered that medical professionals could refuse to prescribe and dispense the drugs. The law also specifies that the terminally ill people must be able to administer the drugs themselves.

		<hr />
		
			&quot;The Science Guy&quot; Bill Nye did not have nice things to say after he visited the Christian attraction Ark Encounter in Kentucky, but Answers in Genesis founder Ken Ham thinks the scientist is just being ridiculously silly.<br />
<br />
Nye told NBC News that the Ark Encounter was &quot;disturbing,&quot; and every single exhibit was &quot;absolutely wrong.&quot; He also claimed that the attraction encourages visitors to trust faith more than science, thus reducing their ability to think critically.<br />
<br />
For his part, Ham writes on his Facebook page that Nye's comments were &quot;really disturbing and troubling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nye wants to convince all children to believe they are just animals who arose by natural processes—and that there's no God! The implications of this belief on the question of the meaning and purpose of life are beyond serious!&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
With Nye's accusation that the exhibits were wrongly interpreted, Ham argues that their exhibits &quot;show quite conclusively that observational science in the fields of geology, genetics, and anthropology confirm biblical history concerning man, animals, and the Flood of Noah's day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ham accuses Nye of having blind faith, since the latter believes life came from natural processes. Ham is also shaking his head to Nye's evidence that &quot;DNA, including its information and language system, arising by natural processes, came about to the fact that 'we're here.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Nye also wants children to be critical thinkers, but Ham says he is undercutting children's ability to determine for themselves what is right and what is not by stating life arose from natural processes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, Bill Nye doesn't want parents to be allowed to teach their children about God. He wants to brainwash kids, to indoctrinate them, in his naturalistic (atheistic) religion of meaninglessness and hopelessness,&quot; says Ham.<br />
<br />
In the video posted on Ham's Facebook page, Ham asks Nye to provide a moral basis for why people wear clothes. Nye responds by saying that people in the scientific community believe that human feelings and emotions are a result of evolution.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that we have sympathy for each other, that we get angry with each other, that we work very hard to raise our children, provide them with resources – [it] is deep within us. It's part of who we are. It's not a result of a top-down issuance of laws. That's the claim in science, and we observe this in other species,&quot; Nye explains.<br />
<br />
Ham counters by saying that God gave people clothes &quot;because of sin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fact that we are wearing clothes is a reminder that God killed animals and clothed Adam and Eve,&quot; he says, arguing that this eventually paved the way for Jesus, who would one day come to &quot;die for our sins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Died for your sin, Bill, and died for mine, be raised from the dead, and offer the free gift of salvation,&quot; Ham says.

			In courtrooms across America, investors are making money through litigation financing. The process allows investors to cover the cost of a lawsuit in exchange for a share of the financial settlement. <br />
<br />
If this process sounds familiar to you, it’s probably because it’s similar to what billionaire Peter Thiel did when he secretly funded a lawsuit from Hulk Hogan against Gawker Media. It’s still unclear whether Thiel benefited financially from $140 million judgement against Gawker, but the impact of his attack is evident.<br />
<br />
Now, a new startup wants to get more people in on the action. Two Harvard undergraduates have created a service called Legalist that uses what they call “data-backed litigation financing,” analyzing civil lawsuits with an algorithm to predict case outcomes and determine which civil lawsuits are worth investing in. <br />
<br />
The startup was developed as part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2016 class. Legalist cofounder Eva Shang is a Thiel Fellow and has received a $100,000 investment from the billionaire’s foundation to build the startup. In reference to the Gawker lawsuit, Eva Shang told Business Insider, “That’s the kind of thing we’re staying away from here.” Legalist will not be backing lawsuits by individuals, like Thiel did for Hogan. Instead, the company will be focusing on commercial and small-business lawsuits. (It’s unclear whether the defendants of these lawsuits are other businesses or individuals.)<br />
<br />
Legalist says it uses an algorithm of 58 different variables including, as Eva Shang told the Silicon Valley Business Journal, who the presiding judge is and the number of cases the judge is currently working on. The algorithm has been fed cases dating back to 1989 and helps people figure out how long a case will last and the risks associated with it.<br />
<br />
In a presentation at Y Combinator’s Demo Day on Tuesday, the founders claimed that the startup funded one lawsuit for $75,000 and expects a return of more than $1 million. Shang says the $1.40 is earned for every $1 spent in litigation financing, which can prove to be a profitable enterprise when you’re spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. <br />
<br />
In 2014, the largest litigation-finance business raked in $82 million in revenue with an operating profit of $61 million. The practice has no doubt continued to rise in popularity. With companies like Legalist making it easier for everyone to invest in lawsuits, it shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. What could go wrong?

<br />
I know a lot of you are big supporters of Assange and WikiLeaks, but when they post the shit that this article says it's simply gone way beyond what is right.<br />
<br />
How the fuck is the following something that falls under &quot;involving war, spying and corruption&quot;, which is what WikiLeaks claims to publish?<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>

			<font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Roboto">Three Saudi cables published by the WikiLeaks identified domestic workers who'd been tortured or sexually abused by their employers, giving the women's full names and passport numbers. One cable named a male teenager who was raped by a man while abroad; a second identified another male teenager who was so violently raped his legs were broken; a third outlined the details of a Saudi man detained for &quot;sexual deviation&quot; — a derogatory term for homosexuality.</span></font>

</div>At least this is good news:<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			&#8203;Even Assange's biggest backers are getting uncomfortable. Journalist Glenn Greenwald, one of the site's leading allies in the media world, has distanced himself from WikiLeaks over its publication strategy. National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, whose asylum in Russia WikiLeaks helped broker, recently suggested the site should take more care to curate its work.<br />
<br />
Others are disillusioned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dietrich, the transparency activist, said he still supported WikiLeaks &quot;in principle&quot; but had been souring on Assange and his colleagues for a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the labels that they really don't like is being called 'anti-privacy activists,'&quot; Dietrich said in a phone interview. &quot;But if you want to live down that label, don't do stuff like this!&quot;
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I'm sorry, but Assange has proven himself a piece of shit.</div>

			Former President Jimmy Carter said Monday that he put on &quot;a false, optimistic face&quot; for months after he was diagnosed with skin cancer, telling fellow Habitat for Humanity workers that when he got the news last year, &quot;I just thought I had a few weeks to live.&quot; <br />
<br />
Speaking in Memphis, Tenn., at the opening of the annual Habitat work project he sponsors with his wife, Rosalynn, Carter, 92, said that he feels &quot;pretty certain about my cure&quot; but that the doctors are still keeping an eye on me.&quot; <br />
<br />
The former president announced a little more than a year ago, on Aug. 14, 2015, that he'd had a mass removed from his liver and that he'd been diagnosed with he has cancer that had spread. It later emerged that melanoma spots had reached his brain. <br />
<br />
Carter underwent treatment with a new drug, Keytruda, and by last December, he dramatically announced at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, where he frequently teaches Sunday school, that the cancer had disappeared. Four months later, he told the congregation that scans showed he was free of cancer and was able to end treatments. <br />
<br />
The months between August and November, however, were difficult, said Carter, the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner who's spent his post-presidential years as a highly visible advocate for the poor worldwide. <br />
<br />
&quot;A year ago, I didn't think I was going to live for two or three weeks,&quot; Carter said Monday. But he soldiered on, and when he arrived in Memphis last November for another Habitat for Humanity project, &quot;I was putting on a kind of a false, optimistic face,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Carter talked more at length last week about the past year during his regular Sunday school lesson at Maranatha Baptist. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was faced with the end of my life, and Rose and I both thought that I just had a few — not more than two or three weeks to live,&quot; he told the congregation. &quot;And I had a feeling, then, of despair.&quot; <br />
<br />
At the same time, &quot;I felt that I was thankful, because I've had a remarkably successful life,&quot; he said. &quot;You know, I was the most powerful person in the world when I was president of the United States, and I've had a wonderful family and everything has been going well.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Habitat project the Carters kicked off Monday is the 33rd they've undertaken just in Memphis — an indication of the whirlwind schedule that the former president and Rosalynn Carter, 89, have continued to keep. This week, they're helping to build 19 new homes for low-income families in the area. <br />
<br />
&quot;We've had a lot of opportunities for our kids and grandkids to go to school,&quot; Jimmy Carter said. &quot;And we're working side by side with families who haven't had all those things. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's very difficult to break down that barrier across that bridge against people who've had everything and people who never had a decent home,&quot; he said. <br />

			A lawyer for Melania Trump said Monday that he had informed several news organizations, including The Daily Mail, that they could face legal action for publishing articles that Ms. Trump contended were defamatory.<br />
<br />
In an email, the lawyer, Charles J. Harder, said Ms. Trump, the wife of Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, “has placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an ‘escort’ in the 1990s.”<br />
<br />
“All such statements are 100 percent false, highly damaging to her reputation, and personally hurtful,” Mr. Harder added. “She understands that news media have certain leeway in a presidential campaign, but outright lying about her in this way exceeds all bounds of appropriate news reporting and human decency.”<br />
<br />
He said no suit had been filed, but added, “That may change.”<br />
<br />
The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />
<br />
Mr. Harder represented the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan in the invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against Gawker Media that ultimately resulted in Gawker’s filing for bankruptcy. Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley entrepreneur who spoke in July at the Republican National Convention, acknowledged in May that he had secretly funded the Hogan case and others against Gawker.<br />
<br />
Among the news outlets that Mr. Harder said had been sent notices were Inquisitr (which apologized to Ms. Trump and retracted an article about her that was published within the last week), Politico and Liberal America.<br />
<br />
Politico declined to comment.<br />
<br />
Reached by telephone, Tiffany Willis, the founder and editor in chief of Liberal America, said her publication received an emailed letter from Mr. Harder. In the email, a copy of which is posted on the publication’s website, Mr. Harder listed several statements he claimed were defamatory and demanded that the publication “immediately and permanently remove each of these statements from the story, and print a full and complete retraction and apology, with as prominent placement as the original story.”<br />
<br />
“Failure to do so,” Mr. Harder added, “will leave my client with no alternative but to institute immediate legal proceedings against you and, should that occur, she would pursue all available causes of action and seek all available legal remedies to the maximum extent permitted by law.”

			BALTIMORE, MD – An 8-month-old baby girl is alive thanks to an act of heroism by the family’s dog, WBAL-TV reports.<br />
<br />
Erika Poremski, of Baltimore, told WBAL-TV she had stepped out of the house to go to her car when the fire started, leaving her baby trapped on the second floor.<br />
<br />
The blaze spread so quickly that Poremski says she couldn’t get to her child, despite several desperate attempts that left her hands and face burned.<br />
<br />
“I just heard her crying and I couldn’t get to her,” Poremski said.<br />
<br />
When firefighters were finally able to enter the home to look for the infant, they made an incredible discovery in an upstairs bedroom – they found the family dog, Polo, covering the child with his body.<br />
<br />
“He stayed with her the whole time in the bedroom and wouldn’t even come downstairs to get out the door,” said Poremski.<br />
<br />
Paramedics revived the infant. She has burns on the side of her face and her arm. But firefighters believe she would not have survived if it weren’t for Polo.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Polo did not survive the fire. “He was my first baby and now I lost him,” Poremski said.<br />
<br />
The infant is in serious condition. The family set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for the baby’s medical expenses.<br />
<br />
The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
