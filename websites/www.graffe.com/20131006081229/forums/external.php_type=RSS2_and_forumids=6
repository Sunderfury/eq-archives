			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>and it still hurts something pretty terrible.<br />
<br />
Literally dropped a porcelain toilet on it. It was my own dumb fault for throwing the thing in the dumpster and forgetting I had the tank lid still on it (stupid), and in an effort to keep from dropping the lid to the concrete below with a loud shatter (stupider), I managed to lose the forward momentum of my throw when I tried catching it with the bend of my elbows (stupidest!) while the bowl and tank were halfway into the dumpster. <br />
<br />
Damn toilet smashed clean on my middle finger middle knuckle, and for the first 5 or 6 days I coudln't even allow anything to touch the damn thing. I knew it wasn't broken because of the way it felt throught he skin, but fractured, very likely it could have been. That time has passed, and it seems if anything its just a bruised bone, and perhaps it might result in a periodic cyst that will have to be surgically removed eventually, but in the mean time, it is still painfully sore if I press down firmly on the knuckle right on the very same point of impact from 3 weeks ago. Definitely less than when it first happened. I massaged alot of the pain out, and moved the tendons around quite a bit for the days after the accident, but now everything I read about it some reports say it will only be painful for 4 to 7 days (Sheesh, i'm way past that), to other reports saying it will last for several months, and up to a year. <br />
<br />
Anyone have any experience with bruised bones? I don't. I drink lots of milk and take multi-vitamins, and generally work injuries with alot of exercise after they occur, but this one is wild, because every time I try and punch through dry-wall or plywood, i feel it, and it slows me down - It even gives one hell of a sting if I knock on a door!<br />
<br />
And yes - I know I should go see a doctor, but its not broken, and all he'll do is prescribe pain medication, which is not something I can operate at work on, so it is a moot point (and I hate popping pills), and I dont' want to throw $50 in the hole just to hear the doc say, &quot;put some ice on it, and be more careful next time.&quot;</div>

Wow, a pretty weird concept that sets up a story that likely already has an ending written. They mention a &quot;7 year&quot; trial of tribulation so I'm guessing that means 7 seasons. Of course, on Fox, who knows. Still, I can't wait to watch the other episodes and get caught up. If you haven't given this one a try I highly recommend it.</div>

<br />
Let's face it, women who choose or have the choice to do so can pass something the size of a watermelon on egress through something that normally couldn't fit the width of a golf ball on ingress.<br />
<br />
Female parts are miraculous and yet one shot to the twins and most guys are down for the count.<br />

If we're going to use genitalia as an insult, I'd like a good one to use on other men.<br />

			OMAHA, Neb. (AP) &#8212; In a split decision released Friday, the Nebraska Supreme Court rejected a 16-year-old ward of the state's request to waive parental consent to get an abortion, saying the girl had not shown she is sufficiently mature and well-informed enough to decide on her own whether to have an abortion.<br />
<br />
The girl, who is not named in the opinion, was living with foster parents this year when a juvenile court terminated the parental rights of her biological parents, who had physically abused and neglected her. In a closed hearing this summer, she told Douglas County District Judge Peter Bataillon she was 10 weeks pregnant and asked for a court order allowing an abortion. She said she would not be able to financially support a child and feared she might lose her foster placement if her foster parents, whom she described as having strong religious beliefs, learned of her pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Her attorney, Catherine Mahern of Omaha, argued that the girl didn't need anyone's consent for an abortion under the regulations of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, which states that &quot;if a ward decides to have an abortion, the consent of the parent(s) or Department is not required,&quot; although notification of the parents of the abortion might be required.<br />
<br />
Nebraska law was changed in 2011 from requiring minors to inform parents of an abortion to requiring them to get the written, notarized consent of a parent or guardian. Exceptions are limited to cases of abuse by the parent or guardian, medical emergencies and instances in which the minor is sufficiently mature and well-informed to decide whether to have an abortion.<br />
<br />
Bataillon rejected the girl's request, saying that for the purpose of her case, her foster parents would serve as her guardians &#8212; even though, under Nebraska law, the department is considered the guardian of wards. Bataillon also found that the girl had not shown she was mature enough to make the decision to seek an abortion.<br />
<br />
Mahern appealed the girl's case, saying Bataillon failed to recognize the exception for abuse in Nebraska's parental consent law. She also said Bataillon should have recused himself because he was not impartial, as evidenced by his asking the girl if she knew that, &quot;When you have the abortion, it's going to kill the child inside you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably the most disturbing aspect of this case was the judge's treatment of this young lady, referring to killing her baby,&quot; Mahern said Friday. &quot;Who talks to a distressed 16-year-old girl like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Court records found online make reference to a Peter Bataillon who served in the 1980s on a committee for Metro Right to Life, an Omaha anti-abortion group.<br />
<br />
Bataillon did not immediately return a message Friday seeking comment on whether he had ever served on a committee for that or any other anti-abortion group.<br />
<br />
Under an expedited process, the Nebraska Supreme Court upheld Bataillon's ruling in August but did not issue a public opinion on it until Friday.<br />
<br />
In the 5-2 opinion, the majority sided with the judge, saying that the abuse exemption does not apply to the girl, finding that a pregnant minor must show, for the purpose of waiving parental consent, that any abuse occurred at the hands of a current parent or guardian. It also found the girl did not prove she was sufficiently mature or well-informed enough to decide to have an abortion.<br />
<br />
As for her argument that the child protection agency's regulations don't require state wards to get parental or agency consent for an abortion, the majority determined that Bataillon was limited to considering only the parameters laid out in the state's parental consent law, which does not spell out from whom state wards would get consent.<br />
<br />
The high court did not consider the girl's argument that Bataillon should have recused himself, because she did not ask him to do so or question his impartiality at trial.<br />
<br />
In a dissent, Justice William Connolly said the girl has no legal parents, and, therefore, didn't have the option of seeking parental consent. That, he said, means the lower court lacked jurisdiction in the case and left her &quot;in a legal limbo &#8212; a quandary of the Legislature's making.&quot;<br />
<br />
He also suggested that Nebraska's parental consent law is open to a constitutional challenge by state wards.<br />
<br />
&quot;I realize that this conclusion means that none of the statutory exceptions apply and that under (the state law), the petitioner is prohibited from obtaining an abortion,&quot; Connolly wrote. &quot;An absolute ban on the petitioner's right to seek an abortion obviously raises constitutional concerns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justice Michael McCormack joined Connolly in the dissent.

She isn't mature enough to make a decision on having a baby, but she's mature enough to raise a baby as a single, teenager mother with no parents.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>james Burke was a staple of UK life back in 70s, major face of &quot;science&quot; on TV<br />
so BBC asked him to do another &quot;vision of the future&quot; item<br />
sorry if it can't be seen by those outside UK or without proxies<br />
Point is what was once silly geek stuff is well on the way to becoming reality: &quot;replicators&quot; or nano-assemblers to be less geeky :P<br />
<br />
if people are no longer held as near-slaves to those who sell/produce goods or own land, think of what that really means<br />
corporations and government are about self-justifiying CONTROL, anyone who thinks otherwise is a damn fool<br />
he who has your food water petrol medicine etc has you by the balls<br />
governments are really about the elite having a framework to protect their interests hence the constant attacks/hate by them of civil liberties etc which was never intended as part of their &quot;world view&quot;<br />
<br />
so IMHO this is part of why we have the huge battle for IP/copyright. it's inevitable that it all comes down to knowledge, blueprints etc, since they cannot own physical things they'll try and hoodwink the public into letting the bastards hold copyrights on any replicated objects...think what that means: you own *nothing* you only lease it, EULAs for chairs, TVs or whatever<br />

Mystery man saves 'lifeless' baby from drowning<br />

<br />
Beckie Thompson and Imogen Beckie Thompson said she owes her baby's life to the man Ditch where car was submerged People watching said Imogen was under the water for over four minutes Damaged Peugeot 206 after accident Miss Thompson said she lost control of her car when she swerved to avoid a van  <br />
<br />
A mother wants to thank the unknown passer-by who saved her four-month-old girl from drowning.<br />
<br />
Imogen was submerged in water for several minutes when her mother's car overturned and plunged into a ditch in Gosberton, Lincolnshire.<br />
<br />
Imogen was &quot;blue and lifeless&quot; when her mother Beckie Thompson pulled her out of the car.<br />
<br />
But a man fought through his own tears as he resuscitated Imogen, who eventually started breathing again.<br />
<br />
Miss Thompson, 21, said she was &quot;hysterical&quot; after pulling Imogen out of the car and passing her to a woman who had stopped to help.<br />
<br />
Baby Imogen Imogen has made a full recovery <br />
&quot;She laid her on the riverbank, and a lad, luckily, just laid her out and started doing CPR,&quot; said Miss Thompson.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was crying, he was very upset. To be honest I don't think anybody expected her to wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite this, she said the man continued to try for &quot;a good two or three minutes&quot;.<br />
<br />
'Four minutes underwater'<br />
 <br />
&quot;Then she [Imogen] made a noise, and then he started to cry a little bit more, but kept going until she was screaming,&quot; said Miss Thompson, from Quadring.<br />
<br />
&quot;The emergency services told the lady that was on the phone, if she's crying that's the best sign that she can give.&quot;<br />
<br />
People watching what happened said Imogen had been under the water for more than four minutes.<br />
<br />
The emergency services arrived and Imogen was airlifted to hospital, but the man left before Miss Thompson could thank him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He's left no information or anything with the police or anything, so I just want him to know that he did save her life, and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have a little girl any more,&quot; said Miss Thompson.<br />
<br />
&quot;I owe her life to him, so I am really, really grateful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Thompson, a trainee nurse, had been driving Imogen to nursery when the accident happened near the junction of Sweetlands Way and Station Road, at about 10:50 BST on 17 September.<br />
<br />
She said she lost control of her car when she swerved to avoid a van.<br />
<br />
Police would like to speak to any delivery drivers who may have been in the area at the time, particularly a white food van with a green stripe around the bottom.<br />
