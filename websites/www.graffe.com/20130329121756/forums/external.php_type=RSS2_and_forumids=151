			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Jonas is a moderator here, according to the message that popped up when i tried to put him on ignore.  But this morning, when I logged in here at Graffe's, I had a couple of PM's from Jonas.  They were titled with typed-in laughter, and contained references to spamming me.  I sent him a two-word reply (Bone-Ass), and his reply to that was so disturbing that I felt that I had to bring up the topic here.<br />
 <br />
I won't violate his privacy by posting the contents of his PM to me, but let it suffice to say that he claimed that when he sent me those PMs he was in the process of recording a script with which he intended to spam my inbox, but that he changed his mind because he realized he might get banned for it.<br />
 <br />
While I'm glad that he decided on his own to not go through with his plan, he was actually in the process of implementing it when he changed his mind.  What the hell kind of loser would set up a spamming script like that?  Especially someone with Mod powers who can't be Ignored?  Is there a process for removing a Moderator who is obviously too immature for the responsibility?</div>
