     There were a lot of things we couldn't do in an SR-71 Blackbird (The Air Force/NASA super fast, highest flying reconnaissance jet, nicknamed, &quot;The Sled&quot;), but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane - intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.<br />
<br />
It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat.<br />
<br />
There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him.<br />
<br />
The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: “November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.”<br />
<br />
Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the &quot;Houston Center voice.&quot; I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios. Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in Beech. “I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.”<br />
<br />
Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. “Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check.” Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: “Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.”<br />
<br />
And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it - the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: “Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?” There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. “Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.”<br />
<br />
I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: “Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.” For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A. came back with, “Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.”<br />
<br />
It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Ever wonder what it is to exist?<br />
<br />
Punch the keys of your keyboard and you feel the keys on the end of your fingers. You feel the pressure and the elastic rebound as they move back upward. They make a sound with each press. It almost sounds like the computer is talking back to you.<br />
<br />
Your hair partially obstructs your view as you peer downwards. That is if you have hair. It almost is as if it is a frame around the painting of the world that is in front of you. It is your world.<br />
<br />
You ate a while ago. Even though you are breathing through your nose, you still can taste the aftertaste in the back of your throat. Your mouth waters after thinking about how satisfying your last meal was. The sense of pleasure that you feel from feeling your stomach full is a double edged sword. You know that next time that you may satisfy such pleasures, you might overfill yourself and feel the pain of having your bowels stretched to the limit of it's capacity.<br />
<br />
What is it like to exist? It is everything that you feel in the moment.<br />
<br />
It is the sounds from the tv. It is the sounds of the cars that pass outside on the road. It is the sound of the car as you pass by people sitting in their living room while you speed past, going seven miles over the speed limit.<br />
<br />
It is the smells. Existing is the slight aroma from the perfume that the girl halfway stretched out on the couch wears as she sleeps next to you. You know that she is only halfway stretched out because she is trying hard not to inconvenience you even though she is doing exactly such to herself. You could not inconvenience yourself by moving to another seat while you watch the movie while the cars move outside, but you don't.<br />
<br />
Existing is the small decisions you make. You could not making the computer sing the song of loneliness while you type and she sleeps, but you don't. The rays of light off the computer screen strains your eyes in the dark and you continue on.<br />
<br />
What is it like to exist? It is the small things that are ignored. They are the things that pass by with little notice. Existing is the things that scream at you letting you know that you are still here but barely realize. The air conditioner's slight hum. The glow from the digital clock. The groans of the floorboards as the people walk around in the apartment above.<br />
<br />
You exist.</div>

</div>Fairly old article, but pertinent issue. Good fish like Tuna and Grouper being filled to the gills with mercury is certainly a huge hazard.<br />

Time has another take on it:<br />

<br />
I'm not sure what to make of this issue. So the fish have all this mercury in them, but the mercury isn't bad for you?</div>

<br />
Although the relationships do not result in reproduction, they could have evolutionary consequences, the researchers say.<br />
<br />
For instance, in a certain Hawaiian population of Laysan albatrosses the males greatly outnumber the females, leaving many females without a long-term male partner. As a result, nearly one-third of the females paired with another female to raise chicks. Despite not raising as many offspring as their counterparts with male mates, they were more successful at rearing chicks than single female birds.<br />
<br />
Such relationships have not gotten much attention because they have not been thought to affect how the species evolves, says lead author Nathan Bailey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California Riverside. But now, researchers are realizing that this may not be true. “Once [same-sex sexual behavior] exists within a population, it could change the social dynamics of that population,” says Bailey.<br />
<br />
Male-male sexual encounters among bottlenose dolphins appear to strengthen social bonds within the group and may also serve as practice for later, which could increase the reproductive success of those dolphins.<br />
<br />
Bailey says the next step is to figure out the role of genetics in these same-sex relationships and also to determine whether same-sex sexual behavior affects other traits as the species evolve.</div>

				The USS John McCain is moving into position and preparing to intercept a North Korean flagged ship that is thought to be carrying weapons.<br />
<br />
The US military has been tracking a ship since it left a North Korean port Wednesday and is believed to be headed for Singapore. The USS John McCain, a navy destroyer, will intercept the ship, Kang Nam, as soon as it leaves North Korean waters off the coast of China. The ship is believed to be carrying weapons, missile components or nuclear materials, which is in direct violation of UN Resolution 1874 which put sanctions in place against Pyongyang Friday.<br />
<br />
According to a senior U.S. defense official. the order has not yet been officially given to confront the vessel, but the US destroyer is moving into position.<br />
<br />
This will be the first direct military contact with North Korea since tensions started to heat up recently when the north detonated a nuclear device underground in the region in May. North Korea has also been test firing short range missiles and has threatened to declare war against any country who interferes with their weapons and nuclear development efforts.

A soldier from County Donegal has been found guilty of four counts of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl. <br />
<br />
Kenneth McDonald, 34, who is attached to the army at Finner Camp in Donegal had sex with the girl in his car in woodlands in 2003. <br />
<br />
During the trial, the victim, who is now 19, told the court that she had sex 59 times that year with 22 men. <br />
<br />
The jury was told there was no suggestion that McDonald coerced or forced the girl to have sex in any way. <br />
<br />
McDonald was placed on the sex offenders' register. The case was adjourned for sentencing. <br />
<br />
The soldier, who serves with the Irish Defence Force, was found not guilty on two other counts. <br />
<br />
McDonald's wife sat beside him as the verdicts were announced. She was very upset and almost collapsed as friends helped her to a car outside. She said that the pair had married in 2004. <br />
<br />
During the trial, the jury was told there was no allegation that the girl did not consent to sex or that McDonald forced himself upon her or coerced her in any way. <br />
<br />
They were also told the law is designed to protect children not only from lustful men but also from themselves.

				Yeah, that's right - AUTODESK!<br />
<br />
They just raided our office, apparently trial versions legally downloaded from their own website with our correct company information isn't quite so legal!<br />
<br />
The trial versions weren't tampered with or doctored and no commercial works was EVER done with them.<br />
<br />
Our company was fined 17000€!! For maya, 3ds max, inventor and autocad. This is an outrage, as if they don't have enough money already, yeah that's right, BUY OVER SOME OTHER COMPANY! RULE THE WORLD WHY DON'T YOU!!<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Sigh...<br />
<br />
To anyone at their offices, please, learn from our mistake. DO NOT DOWNLOAD TRIAL VERSIONS AT WORK. They are NOT legal and count just as bad as if you went to a torrent site and downloaded it there, cracked and all.<br />
<br />
Please don't delete this - I need some support right about now

</div>Autodsesk has, IMHO a highly dubious monopoly on high end 3D software as it now owns 3 out of the 4 &quot;main&quot; apps (Maya, XSI and 3DMAX, the one they don't own is Lightwave) and autodesk has pretty outrageous business practices (see their EULAs, preventing re-transferring licences, and other crap over the years).<br />
Alas, our Lords &amp; Masters haven't a damn clue about tehcnology, and why the monopolies bodies havent' kicked their ass is proof of their ineptitude. :wtf:<br />

One day, the Miswcrosft Software Policew will come for YOU, CItizen!! :ohreally: :grinyes:</div>

				Pardon the cliche, but it's one of the holiest of Holy Grails of technology: Wireless power. And while early lab experiments have been able to &quot;beam&quot; electricity a few feet to power a light bulb, the day when our laptops and cell phones can charge without having to plug them in to a wall socket still seems decades in the future.<br />
<br />
Nokia, however, has taken another baby step in that direction with the invention of a cell phone that recharges itself using a unique system: It harvests ambient radio waves from the air, and turns that energy into usable power. Enough, at least, to keep a cell phone from running out of juice.<br />
<br />
While &quot;traditional&quot; (if there is such a thing) wireless power systems are specifically designed with a transmitter and receiver in mind, Nokia's system isn't finicky about where it gets its wireless waves. TV, radio, other mobile phone systems -- all of this stuff just bounces around the air and most of it is wasted, absorbed into the environment or scattered into the ether. Nokia picks up all the bits and pieces of these waves and uses the collected electromagnetic energy to create electrical current, then uses that to recharge the phone's battery. A huge range of frequencies can be utilized by the system (there's no other way, really, as the energy in any given wave is infinitesimal). It's the same idea that Tesla was exploring 100 years ago, just on a tiny scale.<br />
<br />
Mind you, harvesting ambient electromagnetic energy is never going to offer enough electricity to power your whole house or office, but it just might be enough to keep a cell phone alive and kicking. Currently Nokia is able to harvest all of 5 milliwatts from the air; the goal is to increase that to 20 milliwatts in the short term and 50 milliwatts down the line. That wouldn't be enough to keep the phone alive during an active call, but would be enough to slowly recharge the cell phone battery while it's in standby mode, theoretically offering infinite power -- provided you're not stuck deep underground where radio waves can't penetrate.<br />
<br />
Nokia says it hopes to commercialize the technology in three to five years.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Thanks to finally getting a new mp3 player after my iAudio went down in a blaze of glory (and poorly soldered connections), I've had a golden opportunity to poke around at podcasts and the like.  I found a few awesome things again like Podiobooks and Secret World Chronicles and finally ended up on Decoder Ring Theater, mimicking old radio dramas.  Fast Forward a few weeks to random wiki surfing and I end up on an article about Dimension X; a 1950s sci-fi radio drama with the following description:<br />

				Preceded by Mutual's 2000 Plus (1950-52), Dimension X was not the first adult science fiction series on radio, but the acquisition of previously published stories immediately gave it a strong standing with the science fiction community, as did the choice of well established, respected writers in the field: Isaac Asimov, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, Fredric Brown, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. Beam Piper, Frank M. Robinson, Clifford D. Simak, William Tenn, Jack Vance, Kurt Vonnegut, Jack Williamson and Donald A. Wollheim. Ernest Kinoy and George Lefferts adapted most of the stories and also provided original scripts.

</div>This all leads to the discovery that all 50 episodes are preserved online in mp3 format: <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Dimension_X_Singles" target="_blank">http://www.archive.org/details/OTRR_Dimension_X_Singles</a>.  Archive.org has an entire old radio section with other shows saved and even a full day's programming from the D-day invasion.  Everything I've poked at is in mp3 format and readily downloadable or streamed from the site.  I figured there has to be at least one other person on Graffe's who'd get a kick out of this.</div>

				Story Highlights<ul><li>300,000 cases of Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough being recalled</li>
<li>66 cases of food-borne illness reported in 28 states; dough is one common link</li>
<li>Dough may be contaminated with E. coli, which causes gastric symptoms</li>
<li>Nestle: E. coli not detected in product; recall is safety precaution</li>
</ul><br />
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Two federal agencies warned consumers Friday not to eat raw Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough.<br />
<br />
The company said it is recalling an estimated 300,000 cases of the dough as a precaution after reports of food-borne illness in 28 states.<br />
<br />
There are concerns that the premade dough may be contaminated with the bacterium E. coli 0157:H7, which causes abdominal cramping, vomiting and diarrhea, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Young children and the elderly can suffer more serious symptoms.<br />
<br />
Nestle issued a statement saying, &quot;While the E. coli strain implicated in this investigation has not been detected in our product, the health and safety of our consumers is paramount, so we are initiating this voluntary recall.&quot;<br />
<br />
According to Nestle spokeswoman Laurie MacDonald, raw dough was one of the things the sick people reported eating.<br />
<br />
&quot;The health and safety of our consumers is our No. 1 priority,&quot; she said. &quot;We felt the best thing to do is a voluntary recall.&quot;<br />
<br />
She said the company was informed by the FDA Wednesday night &quot;and immediately took action.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We really want to remind consumers that raw cookie dough should not be eaten,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Since March, the CDC says, 66 people have become sick in 28 states after eating raw cookie dough. Twenty-five people were hospitalized. No one has died.<br />
<br />
The FDA and the CDC say people who have become sick after eating refrigerated Toll House cookie dough should contact their doctors.<br />
<br />
They advise consumers to throw out all prepackaged, refrigerated Nestle Toll House cookie dough products. Retailers and restaurateurs should not sell or serve any Toll House cookie dough products, the agencies said.<br />
<br />
The company said the market share for Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough for the most recent 52-week period was 41 percent.<br />
<br />
The recall does not include already-baked Toll House cookies, varieties of Toll House morsels, chocolate baking bars or cocoa or Dreyer's and Edy's ice cream products with Nestle Toll House cookie dough ingredients.
