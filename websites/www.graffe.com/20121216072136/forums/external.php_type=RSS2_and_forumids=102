			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>No more Media Center, however, Music and Video apps (out of the box) covers the majority of that functionality, and is integrated with the Microsoft Store/Xbox Music service. Also, I still use WinAMP, so this doesn't matter a lot to me, I imagine a lot of you use VLC or something similar. Windows 8 comes with the ability to mount ISO files out of the box, no need for VCD or anything of the sort.<br />
<br />
Sandboxed app selection is pretty weak at this point, except on the Entertainment front, where you've got Netflix, Hulu+, and several major network apps that are all really nice. Games selection in the store seems mostly targeted at Windows 8 RT devices (phone, Surface, etc.).<br />
<br />
Getting used to running Desktop like any other App in the system took all of a day, the new Start Screen that replaces the start menu is way more functional in so many ways than the old start menu, but overall the entire UI is majorly overhauled, like the difference between Windows 3 and Windows 95 different. The various &quot;corner functions&quot; are pretty nice, right side top and bottom corners takes you to the &quot;quick control panel&quot; which has your search, settings, devices, sharing controls and a clickable link to the Start screen. Top left and bottom left provide the task swapping functions for Apps, that is, if you're running the Netflix app, the Skype app, the Desktop app and the Wikipedia app, you use these corner menus to manage the app tasks (tabbing Desktop apps still works as before).<br />
<br />

<br />
For Microsoft-branded productivity, the new Office 2013 and associated suite of productivity tools are a little different from previous versions. The entire Windows platform has adapted to this concept of &quot;workflow&quot;, and pretty much all of the tools, if they don't actually use workflow, have been redesigned to use workflow concepts (Windows Workflow is an actual Windows programming component, used heavily in things like build tools, SharePoint, and several advanced apps like Dynamics). This includes the Office 2013 suite, which now starts you on a Start screen in each app, rather than defaulting to a blank document, for example.<br />
<br />
The idea being here that when you're working through your process, you're going to start by thinking, &quot;I need to do X and the tool to do that is Word,&quot; so therefore you open Word, but you might not always want to start a new document, perhaps you want to open an old one. The Start page in each app allows you to start your personal workflow with the app, and then you decide what you're going to do next, open an old doc, start a new one, publish an existing doc to the Cloud, and a few other things. The idea being that the app makes fewer decisions for you and instead facilitates your workflow.<br />
<br />
Explorer and finally Visio and Project have been updated with the Ribbon bar, some additional functionality has been added to Explorer and all of the Office apps in the top right corner you now have a button next to Minimize, Maximize, Close that allows you to control the state of the ribbon bar, either auto-hide, hidden, or shown. Explorer and the entire suite of system monitoring tools have been completely revamped, and they're actually bad ass awesome now. Task manager provides a whole lot more useful info now, like overall CPU consumption by apps, memory consumption, by app, over time usage by app or service, and really nice charts and tables showing you how your system is performing. The really sweet tweak is to the File Copy dialog, though, which now gives you a progress bar that is also a chart showing bitrate history during the copy.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://carryingthewhale.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/copystatus.png" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
Overall, I'm very pleased with Windows 6.2. I would still recommend waiting for SP1 for Office 2013/Windows 8, but the number of problems with the RTM release compared to most is really clean overall.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, one final note, one click reimage is EPIC.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Last spring, when I was playing SW:ToR, I tried to upgrade the video drivers on my laptop in order for it to play at a decent frame rate.  At the time, the drivers were not digitally signed and I would have to hit F8 and tell Win 7 to ignore checking those and continue to boot.  At the time I found a batch file on a tech site that did this automatically, so it added a few seconds to the boot time, but I didn't have to do this manually every time.<br />
<br />
Now the drivers have been updated and are digitally signed and I'm wanting to remove that batch file so my bootup will speed up a bit.  I can't find the page I got the file from and I can't find where the batch file is to remove it.<br />
<br />
Anyone got an idea where to look to remove this?  I've been through MSConfig and don't see anything in there.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Just moved. Hooked up the computer, attached everything, and now it won't power on. It worked great before the move, and didn't suffer any visible damage during the transition. <br />
<br />
Power supply seems ok. When plugged in, a blue ready light on the motherboard comes on. Nothing else. The supply switch is set to &quot;on&quot; position.  No spare, but that's next on my agenda to swap and test. <br />
<br />
Thought it might be the power button; perhaps it severed. Unfortunately, the case is sealed and the wires are extremely hard to see, let alone get at. Unplugged the button and tried shorting the pins on the motherboard with a flathead screwdriver, but got nothing. Still not turning on. <br />
<br />
Before I flip out and try replacing the motherboard, does anyone have any other ideas I might pursue?</div>

For Christmas, my wife would like to buy/acquire, install, and support a PC-Anywhere or Remote Desktop program of some kind so that she (we) can keep an eye on her mom's computer. They live in the sticks, and they're old - so we have to do things like &quot;here's how you add an attachment&quot; and &quot;no, don't click on that program you downloaded, it's a virus.&quot; Her plan is to use this to save time/effort, but I'm skeptical - most of the solutions I remember were terrible.<br />
<br />
This would be from a Windows machine to a Windows machine, both using 7, I think.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or experiences to share?</div>
