			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am going to attempt to purchase my first new car from a dealership. I know what I want, I know how much the model costs and I know how much trade in is worth. I am going to try to get with my bank to get approval for an auto loan (will have my dad co-sign, if needed) before I go to the dealership. My father will also accompany me to the dealership (he has done this sort of thing before), too. I've read a few articles on the Do's and the Don'ts for when buying a car so I have a pretty *decent* idea of what to expect. But I don't know everything and lack experience. I'm also generally a passive quiet person though I know when to assert myself (aka no means no).<br />
<br />
Can anyone provide me some additional advice, tips or personal experiences regarding this process?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div>

				I realize this pours gas on <a href="http://kotaku.com/5037860/forgive-dad-he-knows-not-what-he-does#viewcomments" target="_blank">the bad parenting flames </a>of yesterday, but holy crow, I can't not show you this story. Yesterday reader tooji tipped me off to the story of Blake Peebles, a 16-year-old in Raleigh, N.C., whose parents have let him drop out of school so that he can focus on a professional gaming career via Guitar Hero.<br />
<br />
Blake convinced his folks (that is, &quot;We couldn't take the complaining anymore,&quot; said his mom) to let him drop out last September. They hired in-home tutors to continue his education there, at least, but there's no doubt priority number one is Guitar Hero. There's a vaguely defined goal of Blake playing it professionally, either through Major League Gaming or by winning prizes in a national and international competitions. But so far he's only made about $1,000, most of that value realized in meals and other freebies won at local competitions. The other pro gamer the reporter contacted for this story said he's cashed in about $25,000 in his entire career.<br />
<br />
The description of Blake's room, his interests (or lack thereof) , and his folks' decision to let him do this just ... well, the don't make anyone look good. It would be one thing if the guy was a bona fide music or athletic prodigy. However quixotic a career in either field might be for the majority who pursue it, at least there's a long history of it paying off if you are that good enough. But Blake's never touched a real guitar (cue up the get-a-life bait). He didn't seem interested in much of anything in high school (a Christian academy where his parents had enrolled him) and wheedled his way out of going by complaining that it was a waste of time. (That line should sound very familiar to my folks. If only playing Master of the Lamps on the Commodore 64 could have won me some free Chik-Fil-A. I might have had better luck.)<br />
<br />
You gotta read it to believe it, and nearly three weeks after it was first published, it is still one of The News &amp; Observer's top e-mailed stories. Try to keep it civil in the comments, gang, especially if you aren't a parent. I'm not, but I'll admit this blows my mind.<br />
<br />
Update: Reader yoagner. points us to an <a href="http://thestory.org/archive/the_story_581_Homeschool_Of_Rock.mp3" target="_blank">.mp3 </a>of an American Public Media feature on Blake. The story's page <a href="http://thestory.org/archive/the_story_581_Homeschool_Of_Rock.mp3/view" target="_blank">is here</a>.<br />

				Drug chief angry at medicine cost  <br />
 <br />
NICE advises on which drugs should be bought by the NHS <br />
The head of a government health advisory body has accused pharmaceutical companies of driving up the price of medicine. <br />
<br />
Professor Sir Michael Rawlins says drugs are expensive because of &quot;perverse incentives&quot; in the pharmaceutical industry. <br />
<br />
The chairman of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) made his comments to the Observer newspaper. <br />
<br />
NICE has recently been criticised for failing to approve kidney cancer drugs. <br />
<br />
Double-digit growth <br />
<br />
It advises the NHS in England and Wales on which drugs to buy. <br />
<br />
Sir Michael said: &quot;We are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive. <br />
<br />
<b>&quot;Pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double-digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that, not least because their senior management's earnings are related to the share price. </b><br />
<br />
  Pharmaceutical companies make a huge investment into public health when they develop a new medicine. <br />
<br />
Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not in their interests to take less profit, personally as well as from the point of view of the business. All these perverse incentives drive the price up.&quot; <br />
<br />
Sir Michael said companies set high prices as a means of &quot;cushioning&quot; against the time when their products are no longer protected by patents and competitors can then make cheaper versions. <br />
<br />
He also said: &quot;The other thing we have to pay for is the costs of marketing. Marketing costs generally are about twice the spend on research and development.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Huge investment' <br />
<br />
A spokeswoman for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said drugs companies insist they are committed to cutting prices. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, pharmaceutical companies make a huge investment into public health when they develop a new medicine. <br />
<br />
&quot;It costs on average £550m, and takes more than 10 years, to bring each new treatment to patients. <br />
<br />
&quot;Naturally companies will look to recoup such costs through the final price.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professor Sir Michael Rawlins is angry at the drugs companies<br />
<br />
BBC health reporter James Cook said drug companies also claim that without the vast sums they invest in research and development, many life saving drugs would not exist at all. <br />
<br />
There are treatments for advanced kidney cancer that are widely available elsewhere in Europe, but NICE decided that four drug treatments for the disease should remain unavailable on the NHS because they did not meet NICE criteria for &quot;cost-effectiveness&quot;. <br />
<br />
The drugs cost between £20,000 to £35,000 a year per patient and although they cannot &quot;cure&quot; advanced renal cell carcinoma or cancer that has spread from the initial tumour they can help extend a patients' life by around five to six months. <br />
<br />
Sir Michael told the Observer other patients would have lost out: &quot;We have a finite amount of money for healthcare, and if you spend money one way your can't spend it another.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><a href="http://www.fohguild.org/forums/1166233-post5273.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link - very very excellent information.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>Full text</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = '';		this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
Every healer gets an instant cast 15 second duration HoT and a 1 second cast Heal with a HoT, like WoW druid Rejuv and Regrowth. At rank 20, all healers get a group heal with a cast time.<br />
<br />
Melee healers (Disciple of Khaine and Warrior Priest) also get melee heals that heal their defensive target and allies in a small radius for a percentage of the damage done. Their big single-target heal is a channeled melee attack that hits their offensive target up to four times and heals their defensive target for several times the amount of the damage dealt. That attack can be interrupted or cut short if someone damages the melee healer.<br />
<br />
Then if they spec into their healing path, they can learn a group absorb shield or group HoT.<br />
<br />
The melee healers mechanic is based on using Action Point-based melee attacks to generate Soul Essence (DoK) or Righeous Fury (WP). Each heal takes a certain amount of SE/RF. The melee healers have to stay on the front lines attacking in order to keep healing. For keep sieges where they cannot attack, they have a channeled skill that transforms AP to SE/RF.<br />
<br />
They have three Mastery paths that are basically a Heal path, a Buff/Debuff path, and a Damage path. The HoTs and group heals are based on Willpower. The melee heals are based on the damage dealt so Strength gear improves them.<br />
<br />
The so-called 'Flex' healers (Zealot and Rune Priest) get a 3-second cast big single target heal, but it is fragile meaning it suffers severe cast-time setback if someone damages them during the cast. They also get an instant cast very minor direct heal, a small cast time single-target absorb shield that also does a minor heal when it fades, and a bouncing HoT that's sort of like a cross between Chain Heal and Prayer of Mending from WoW.<br />
<br />
Their heals are all AP-based. They also get single target stat-buffs that the target can click for an effect like a DD or AE every 60 seconds without dispelling the buff. Their mechanic involves Rituals or Master Runes that they are learned through the Mastery Paths. These pulse an effect in an area around the ground target, like a small heal or AP regen.<br />
<br />
The Zealot and RP Mastery Paths are basically split between single target direct, group, and over time effects. Each Path affects a few damage and heal spells. How they spend their Mastery Points determines how good each individual heal is. Split spec and all the heals are average. Focus on one spec and that path's heals are excellent but the other paths' heals are meh.<br />
<br />
The 'Hybrid' healers (Shaman and Archmage) have a unique mechanic. Each spell they cast builds either damage or healing magic, up to 5 points. Each point increases the effectiveness of instant spells by 5% or reduces cast time by 20%. If you cast 5 damage spells, your next healing spell with a cast time is an instant cast. Cast 5 heal spells and your next instant nuke/DoT does 25% more damage.<br />
<br />
Like the 'Flex' healers, they get a 3 second cast big single target heal that is fragile meaning the cast time is easily set back when they take damage. They also get an instant cast single-target groupmember only damage absorb shield.<br />
<br />
Their Mastery paths can be summed up as Heals, Direct Damage, and Buffs/Debuffs. Heal spec Shamans get an instant cast single-target 9 second duration BIG HoT. Heal spec Archmages get a 3-second channeled heal/HoT that heals once every second.<br />
<br />
I think the best healers are the Shaman/Archmage because all their heals are improved by one Mastery line. Their mechanic is really fun too. Nuke away and you can get an instant cast big or group heal. If you are healbotting, you can throw in an instant cast DD or a 25% stronger instant cast DoT.<br />
<br />
And as most of you suspected, Mist is wrong about healing. The main heals are HoTs or a 3 second cast. People take longer to kill than in WoW, but they still go down pretty fast under focus fire, especially once healing debuffs start coming into play. 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
I'm leaning heavily towards a shaman at this point in time.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>When I was in high school, I fondly remember our teachers throwing out the age-old threat of drop outs who can only find jobs that require knowledge of the phrase <i>&quot;Would you like fries with that?</i> Luckily for me, I wisely went on to college, earned my degree, and now work in a field that only occasionally asks me to speak with customers, and rarely are they idiots.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for me, I still like the fast food from time to time.  Not every night, mind you, but about once a week it is nice to simply run out for lunch and eat something unhealthy (yet tasty!) while continuing to troubleshoot some asshat programmer's shitty code.  So, about once or twice a month, I treat myself to lunch from Taco Time.<br />
<br />
For those without the heavenly goodness that is Taco Time, think Taco Bell with higher prices but much better tasting food.  While I wouldn't go so far as to call their food 'authentic' by any means, I will say that it is much closer to real mexican food than Taco Bell claims. <br />
<br />
However, every single time I go through the drive through, I'm asked no less than three times what kind of hot sauce I want.  Not *if* I want hot sauce, but *what kind* of hot sauce.<br />
<br />
I do not like hot sauce.  I feel that it ruins the natural flavour of food, seeking to only cover up a taste that you probably couldn't stand without it.  Where as things like mayonnaise and ketchup accent a taste, hot sauce tries to simply over power it.  Yet, no matter how many times I state <i>&quot;No sauce, please,&quot;</i> those minimum wage register jockeys can't get it through their fucking head that someone out there might not like their hot sauce.<br />
<br />
What's even better is that Taco Time does not serve mild hot sauce.  They have three distinct flavours; <i>Caliente (hot)</i>, <i>Picante (You really didn't want to taste food for another week anyways, right?)</i>, and the ever popular and fun to say, <i>Diablo de la Sol</i>, which translate to <i>&quot;Devil of the Sun.&quot;</i>  We also refer to this particular brand as the <i>&quot;Super Colon Raper.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
I tried <i>Diablo de la Sol</i> once, on a dare.  My sphincter still involuntarily clenches at the mere thought of the torture that shit puts you through.  I can not fathom why people would willingly put something that vile into their bodies, knowing full well what is going to happen in a few hours when it decides it's time to punish you a second time.<br />
<br />
Yet, I still love the food itself, so I put up with the incessant queries regarding my favoured choice of hot sauce.  As I said earlier, three times is the average per trip, while my personal best is six individual requests, though admittedly not from six different employees.<br />
<br />
It was during a walk in trip with some coworkers of mine.  I was the last to place my order, and had a rather complicated order.  The first was right after paying.  This one is the expected request - employees are trained to at least ask once, I presume.  I responded with my usual <i>&quot;None, thanks,&quot;</i> which satisfied the employee ringing me up.<br />
<br />
The second request came from a different employee who called me up to the counter to confirm my choice of sour cream yet no guacamole on my Natural Super Taco.  I swear it must have been simply out of reflex that he asked me, as his hand was already moving towards the cardboard bins hidden under neath the counter top.  It took him a moment to process my answer, as if he was unaccustomed to someone rejecting his hot sauce.  He didn't make a scene out of it, however, so nothing came of it.<br />
<br />
The third, fourth, and fifth requests came in a flurry as I picked up my food.  It was a third employee, young, attractive, and a complete air head. It also important to note that this particular employee was of Hispanic descent.  For maximum effect, let me transcribe the conversation, but remember it is from memory and may be a bit sketchy.<br />
<br />
Her: Hot sauce?<br />
Me: No, thanks.  <i>(At this point I'm usually irritable.  I shouldn't have to say it three fuckin' times.)</i><br />
Her: You said Picante?  <i>I see her hand darting for the packets.</i><br />
Me:  No!  No hot sauce.  None.  I. Do. Not. <i>Like.</i> Hot. Sauce.<br />
<br />
I remember emphasizing the word 'like.'  I'll admit that I sometimes speak a lot like Chandler from 'Friends' and emphasis words that really shouldn't be.  <br />
<br />
At this point the employee gets a curious look on her face, as if she, her culture, and her heritage were all insulted at once by a filthy Gringo. It was obvious that she didn't understand this concept of 'not liking hot sauce.' <br />
<br />
Her: Let me get the manager...<br />
Me: What?  Why?  Can't I just go?<br />
<br />
Up comes the original girl who rang me up.  <br />
<br />
Manager:  Is there something wrong with our hot sauce?<br />
Me:  No, I'm sure it's fine, I just don't like it.<br />
Manager:  Oh, because it's too hot?  Because 'caliente' isn't really that hot, though it say-<br />
Me:  No!  I just don't like hot sauce!  FUCK.<br />
<br />
Yes, I loudly proclaimed 'fuck' in the middle of this fast food joint, in the middle of the lunch rush, surrounded by my coworkers, and quite possibly some children who delight in not having a working asshole.<br />
<br />
I am no longer welcome at that Taco Time.  As far as I'm concerned, they can open a few of their shitty packets of 'Diablo de la Sol', shove them up their sandy vaginas, then butterfly each other until their cracks feel as bad as my asshole did the day I dared to put any of their shit on my food.</div>
