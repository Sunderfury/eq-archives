			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So I decided to run Malwarebytes, a program my firewall support told me is compatible and might help with something their software didn't. (It didn't but ...)<br />
<br />
I run it as admin and it prompts me to update. The installer tells me to turn off all programs and firewall/anti-virus. Only things I left running were Task Manager and my firewall's virtual threat manager (uses a virtual computer in the cloud.)<br />
<br />
Task manager says Setup/Uninstall (32 bit) (2) <font color="#FF0000">not responding</font><br />
<br />
<font color="#000000">The install is 85% done and hung. I turned off the threat emulation at that point but no joy. This is similar to what I had happen last time the firewall/virus tried to update for Win 10.<br />
<br />
After that other programs started getting corrupted and I'm still cleaning up that mess. (Netflix, and Kindle apps are still fried.)<br />
<br />
I still have the install left hung. What do I do next?</font></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Suddenly my computer will randomly stop displaying a signal.  The computer remains running.  It is a GeForce 960, it is a couple years old at this point.  It is a new issue, I was playing Far Cry 3 for a few hours, with no problems.  No signs of overheating as far as I could tell.  But then when I went to watch a movie(Nightmare Before Christmas, not that has anything to do with it.) it stopped displaying a signal.  It has been doing it randomly ever since.  If I try to boot up a game, it generally will stop displaying a signal.  I have taken the card out, and put it back in, it still does it. I just recently switched in a new motherboard, but it was running just fine, until that one day.  Any ideas?</div>
