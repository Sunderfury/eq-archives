I don't know dick about rugby. There is no fucking chance I would be playing with that guy who planned that hit though, that is insanely dangerous play and intentionally so. <br />
<br />
Other thoughts, while I had no opinion on the matter beforehand, I have a lot of respect and appreciation for how the Australian fans behaved during that scene.<br />
<br />
I have even more respect for how the players behaved though, fighting the right people and most importantly having enough awareness to let the medical staff tend to the player while seeking retribution. <br />
<br />
That same scene would be a complete clusterfuck in the US with uninvolved parties getting pulled into the fray and teammates unintentional causing further harm to the attacked player.<br />
<br />
The announcers also didn't bullshit the audience over what just happened either, admitting it was a dick move. In the US announcers cannot even admit when a player got their cunt/nuts molested as even a sanitized medical term is too hot for TV when it comes to observing that people have genitalia for sportscasters, referring to it as the groin/abdomen or some other bullshit.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Mostly Autism [1] Speaks Unfunded Research Quarterly presents to you... findings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since always, I have thought while Scar Jo is a terrible actress (with exception to Lost in Translation). [2] <br />
<br />
There is a scene in Age of Ultron that made why the way she behaves in a scene seem false. When scar jo is in character she is acting like someone who is trying to portray someone acting like someone who is portraying a character rather than someone who is that character. <br />
<br />
When Scar Jo did VA for Her, she was great in it, but you don't see her express what she is saying in the movie so Jo cannot reveal the behavior is not truly felt.<br />
<br />
In all her other films, her behaviors, tones, etc. do not match each other. It is continually a portrayal of an idea rather than a reenactment of the character experiencing and partaking in an idea. The result is that the depiction feels inauthentic and the suspension of disbelief is lost.<br />
<br />
In scenes where scar jo is intentionally being duplicitous it is less believable than other parts because making a lie seem true involves playing multiple roles simultaneously, so it is a hard task and why few people can lie without revealing they are lying at the same time.<br />
<br />
[1] still think that is among the funniest things I've seen on the Internet, unreasonably accurate IMO<br />
<br />
My IRL BFF Jill's GIF assessment:<br />
<center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AJMfQur.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></center><br />
<br />
[2] That she is good in this movie actually maintains my hypothesis though, consider that is exactly the right portrayal for her character in the film. At the age of the character no one comes to mind whose responses are not mimicry in real life. Jojo's character is not a human being yet, she's still responding in a way she has seen other people respond in that same or similar situations.</div>

		<hr />
		
			About 108,000 young undocumented immigrants received three-year protections and U.S. work permits in a several-month period in late 2014 and early 2015. They hadn’t done anything wrong — they just applied for a government program in the same way hundreds of thousands of so-called Dreamers have done since the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program started in 2012. <br />
<br />
But the fact that they got those three-year permits, rather than the two-year permits distributed since 2012, could put them at risk of having their personal information — including names and addresses — released to state authorities. <br />
<br />
This would be as a result of a Thursday court order by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, who last year blocked President Barack Obama’s 2014 executive actions on immigration reform — namely, an expansion of DACA and a new program for parents called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court is currently considering whether those executive actions should be allowed to move forward. But in the meantime, Hanen, who is based in Brownsville, Texas, is railing from the bench over the Justice Department attorneys’ actions in his court, where the lawsuit from 26 states started. <br />
<br />
Hanen’s latest court order rebukes Justice Department attorneys for their conduct in proceedings for Obama’s 2014 executive actions. It also demands that the federal government hand over a list of certain DACA recipients in the 26 states that sued over Obama’s immigration programs. <br />
<br />
The list wouldn’t just be names — Hanen ordered the government to include the DACA recipients’ addresses, contact information and dates when their work permits were renewed or granted. Hanen also requested the recipients’ “A” numbers, which are used by immigration enforcement to identify undocumented immigrants.<br />
<br />
Hanen ordered the Justice Department to give him a sealed copy of this list by June 10, and said it would remain sealed until the Supreme Court issues a decision. At that point, though, he said states could request that the court release some or part of the list to authorities if they showed good cause that the information included would minimize or prevent harm in that state.<br />
<br />
The federal government already has all of this information, of course. The chief selling point of DACA and DAPA was that they would help federal immigration authorities identify undocumented immigrants with strong ties to the community who would not be priorities for deportation, so they could focus on removing other people instead. <br />
<br />
But Hanen’s order could put the list in the hands of state authorities who oppose Obama’s actions to protect undocumented immigrants. <br />
<br />
It’s not clear what the state authorities would do with that information. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) issued a statement Thursday applauding the broader order. A spokeswoman for Paxton declined to elaborate on whether the state sought that information or what it would do with it.<br />
<br />
Either way, it’s a frightening prospect for Dreamers, particularly as they prepare for the potential presidency of Republican Donald Trump, who has vowed not just to end DACA but to deport or drive out all undocumented immigrants.<br />
<br />
 “Judge Hanen knows that DACA beneficiaries have been thriving, yet he’s asking for the personal information of young people just to whip up fear,” Greisa Martinez, advocacy director of the group United We Dream, said in a statement. “It’s one more example of anti-immigrant extremists using the courts to advance the Republican hate agenda.” <br />
<br />
The backstory on who would be included and how the order came about is a bit complicated. Obama established DACA in 2012. In November 2014, he announced plans to create DAPA and expand DACA to a broader group of undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, set for implementation in the spring of 2015. He also said the government would grant three-year work permits, rather than the two-year permits granted under the 2012 iteration of DACA.  <br />
<br />
After that announcement, the government continued to issue DACA permits and to renew them for people who fit the requirements for the initial iteration of the program. And the permits it issued were for three years, rather than two. <br />
<br />
Therein lies the controversy. By the time Hanen issued a preliminary injunction on the 2014 executive actions in February 2015, the government had already granted about 108,000 three-year work permits to DACA recipients who fit the requirements of the 2012 program. (The 2012 version of the program was not part of the lawsuit, and is still in effect.) Hanen has accused the Justice Department of being deceptive by failing initially to state clearly that this aspect of the executive actions had already begun. <br />
<br />
He ordered the government to rescind those three-year permits. The government did not rescind the permits granted before the injunction date, but it did recall any issued in error since then. It is now only granting two-year permits, and only to people who were eligible for the original version of DACA.<br />
<br />
Hanen now wants a list of people who, as he puts it in the court order, received three-year permits during the period “in which the attorneys for the Justice Department promised that no benefits were being conferred.” Since this only applies to the 26 states that joined the anti-immigration action lawsuit, it’s not clear how many of the 108,000 Dreamers from the period in question would be included. <br />
<br />
United We Dream has launched a petition to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking her not to give the courts the undocumented young people’s information. <br />
<br />
The Justice Department on Friday declined to comment on the order for a list. A spokesman told reporters in a statement on Thursday that the department “strongly disagrees with the order,” but did not say whether it plans to appeal.

			<title>News Whitney Houston and the Holographic Hell to Come</title>

<br />

		<hr />
		
			In regards to leaked footage of a holographic Whitney Houston performing on The Voice, the Internet has done what it’s meant to do: ridicule. “It’s not right and it’s not okay” has been coined, as it needed to be. Whitty Hutton has been invoked. And the Houston estate has pulled the plug.<br />
<br />
“Holograms are new technology that take time to perfect, and we believe with artists of this iconic caliber, it must be perfect,” Pat Houston said yesterday. “Whitney’s legacy and her devoted fans deserve perfection. After closely viewing the performance, we decided the hologram was not ready to air.”<br />
<br />
The Voice premiere of the long-hyped holoHouston was meant to raise the curtain on a new era of entertainment, when living human performers are no longer needed to distract the masses. <b>But make no mistake: That era is still coming, or at least a lot of people are still working to make it so. 3D recreations of Selena and Notorious B.I.G. are reportedly on their way. The billionaire behind of one of the more ambitious hologram companies has talked about reforming the Beatles and even resurrecting Jesus again.</b> (Caveat: “Hologram” is a technically inaccurate term, but like the word “hoverboard,” it’s what we’re calling these things.)<br />
<br />
What’s interesting about the backlash to the Whitney footage is that it concerned the quality of the reproduction, not the fact it happened at all. If the creature belting “I’m Every Woman” next to Christina Aguilera had more resembled the actual woman who sang the song in 1992, the logic goes, applause and not jeers would have resulted. Is that right? I’ve previously expressed amusement about coming hologram trend, reasoning that this kind of nostalgic recreation isn’t, in the abstract, creepier than any other kind. But watching the scrapped Voice video that may or may not be circulating online, it’s hard not to feel deep dread about the day when this method is “perfected.”<br />
<br />
The performance begins as standard tribute, with Aguilera belting “I Have Nothing” as still images of Houston stand behind her. Then Aguilera says, “Ladies and gentlemen, Whitney Houston,” the curtain falls, and we see a stage farther in the back of the room with the dead diva sort of hovering on it. When Aguilera steps onto that second stage it feels like when Mike Teavee in Willie Wonka meets his fate.<br />
<br />
Why is Aguilera acting like the image next to her is a real person? What’s the point? The genius of a great pop star always lies, on some level, on their ability to make a moment unique—to imbue humanity into product. There is no chance of a hologram doing that until we have Ex Machina-level AI. What’s more, the tragic dimensions of Houston’s life, the sense that she was exploited and dehumanized by fame, can’t help but come to the fore in this context.<br />
<br />
But when technology progresses, it’s usually without anyone getting to vote on whether it’s a good idea that it does. The financial worth of nostalgia has been amply demonstrated. Whitney will return at some point, seeming like herself in all but the most important ways.<br />

			Oklahoma’s Republican-dominated legislature has filed a measure calling for President Barack Obama’s impeachment over his administration’s recommendations on accommodating transgender students, saying he overstepped his constitutional authority.<br />
<br />
Lawmakers in the socially conservative state are also expected to take up a measure as early as Friday that would allow students to claim a religious right to have separate but equal bathrooms and changing facilities to segregate them from transgender students.<br />
<br />
The bill introduced on Thursday night could force schools into costly construction, which would be difficult for them to complete after lawmakers significantly cut education funding to plug a $1.3 billion state budget shortfall.<br />
<br />
The impeachment resolution also introduced on Thursday night calls on the Oklahoma members of the U.S. House of Representatives to file articles of impeachment against Obama, the U.S. attorney general, the U.S. secretary of education and others over the letter.<br />
<br />
The Obama administration told U.S. public schools last week that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choice, upsetting Republicans and raising the likelihood of fights over federal funding and legal authority.<br />
<br />
The impeachment call seems to be on shaky ground since the letter offered non-binding guidance and did not have the force of law, legal experts told local media.<br />
<br />
State Representative John Bennett, a Republican, said in a statement the White House directive was “biblically wrong,” and a violation of state sovereignty.<br />
<br />
The Oklahoma bill would allow for segregation at school restrooms, athletic changing facilities and showers if a request is made to accommodate religious beliefs.<br />
<br />
It also allows the attorney general to file lawsuits to implement the changes.<br />
<br />
Troy Stevenson, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an LGBT advocacy group said the measure promoted fear-mongering and was out of place<br />
<br />
“In a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth,” he said in a statement. <br />
<br />
The measure was introduced just hours after lawmakers in the budget-challenged state set itself up for a bruising legal fight after approving a bill that would make abortions a felony punishable by up to three years in prison for doctors who perform them.<br />
<br />
Abortion rights groups have promised a court battle if Governor Mary Fallin, a anti-abortion Republican, approves the measure.

<br />
The reason I started a FW tank again was so that I would feel confident and familiar in the hobby while I put together my first reef tank, an aspect of the hobby that I know little, to nothing about. <br />
<br />
I truly knew less about it than I thought, because this book in the first chapter eloquently describes how naturally occurring reef systems in the wild originate, evolve, expire, and then create new reef systems. This is something that no website or forum (or previously read book) answered for me, Ironic as it were, that the argument against books in the knowledge base of internet resources boasts that the material in said books is out of date or impractical against moddrnization of the industry that encapsulates the hobby. <br />
<br />
This is a phenomenal book, and I am so happy with my purchase, that if anyone else is interested in starting even a Fish Only With Live Rock tank, I highly recommend it.</div>

It amazes me that after 16 years, they can still come up with new and interesting twists.  This was one of the best seasons in recent years IMO.<br />
<br />
New twists:<br />
super idol - combine two immunity idols and get an idol that you can play after the vote.  And the way it worked out this year, it turned into a huge backstab<br />
final reward - winner of the final reward got to vote a jury member off.  Huge twist.<br />
<br />
I think the winner deserved it.  And every year I say I'm not going to watch it any more, but every year I'm wrong :)</div>

How can a game that celebrates the greatest characters across all Blizzard properties have three dwarves and not one gnome? It can’t, so Heroes of the Storm now has a gnome, though technically she’s a dragon. It’s complicated.<br />
<br />
Chromie is now available in Blizzard’s MOBA, bringing the measured adorability of the gnome race to the Nexus, along with the time-bending powers of one of World of Warcraft’s most powerful bronze dragons. Chromie is actually Chronormu, the female bronzie dedicated to maintaining timelines and historical events. She’s a more sociable sort than most dragons, so she picked a form everyone can love.<br />
<br />
Everyone.<br />
<br />
Chromie is all about time blasts and sands of time and other time-related things. Time, time, time. <br />
<br />
The latest ranged assassin in Heroes of the Storm, Chromie might not technically be a gnome, but that doesn’t lessen the race. That an all-powerful dragon would choose such a form just goes to prove how amazing gnomes are. <br />
<br />
Yes, we’ll go with that.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Suddenly my computer will randomly stop displaying a signal.  The computer remains running.  It is a GeForce 960, it is a couple years old at this point.  It is a new issue, I was playing Far Cry 3 for a few hours, with no problems.  No signs of overheating as far as I could tell.  But then when I went to watch a movie(Nightmare Before Christmas, not that has anything to do with it.) it stopped displaying a signal.  It has been doing it randomly ever since.  If I try to boot up a game, it generally will stop displaying a signal.  I have taken the card out, and put it back in, it still does it. I just recently switched in a new motherboard, but it was running just fine, until that one day.  Any ideas?</div>

Dude, your team is a nightmare.  Just when they seem to be getting better organized even if their coach is really a DCoordinator, they fall apart again.</div>
