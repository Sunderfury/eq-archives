<br />
Of course, I had friends motivated enough to go farms spells from Guardian wurms in Skyfire, Kunark Dragons, etc. too so that might have influenced my thinking somewhat.<br />
<br />
Now that PoP has been around a while and Draught of Ro is worth about 100 pp tops, Sunstrike is near worthless unless you are fully geared in level 3 focus items and are masocistic enough to stop levelling at 60.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't pay for it, but it might be easier for you to get 20k than it is to get a copy of the spell, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

Its still the easiest to get of our three biggest nukes.  I paid 1000 adventure points (worth about 70k on Firiona Vie) for it and I thought the spell was well worth it.  Runes had treated me very badly and it never came up for sale in the bazaar, so /shrug.</div></div><hr />

I would have to agree. Before PoP I could not see spending any plat for any level 65 spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the confusion ... forget I said anything about adventure points and just think of it as 70k plat.  <br />
<br />
The explanation for that is that *only on the Firiona Vie server* you can buy, sell and trade adventure points and the going price is generally 7k plat per 100 points.  I was being overly specific because in my mind it cost 1000 adventure points since no plat changed hands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some encounters are yes, but the Mobs are ugly, the zones are Boring in layout, and there is absolutely no logic whatsoever to the mob placement.<br />
<br />
Just walk around in Ferubi. What the hell are all those monsters doing just standing around there in those Boring same lookalike corridors. You just Grind through Boring corridors with sometimes an interesting room to kill a few nameds to get the Smith Rondo event to pop to kill an interesting encounter in another Boring room to hope that a nice Offhand shield drops.<br />
<br />
KoD'Taz is also annoying. Lousy layout and Boring landscape. There simply isn't anything interesting shaped in those zones. Even South Karana looks better.</div></div><hr />

If they arent vendor they will be very very high for the first months so add that into the equation as well. Can you go til Dec without a big nuke?</div></div><hr />

Of course the elemental gloves are a whole new ballgame, but not obtainable by someone who needs help/advice in acquiring SoS.  65 spell runes are plentiful at that level.</div></div><hr />

why are ornate gloves no good?  i thought it was a constant mana reduction, where MP4 is random?</div></div><hr />

Ornate gloves (20%) &gt; mage summoned earring (15%) &gt; MP4 (10%)</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of these are random 1-X%, but your point is still valid.<br />
Gloves will average 10.5% Mana reduction, MP4 will average 5.5% Mana reduction.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to get SoS, and have both Ornate Gloves (for SoS) and MP4 (or better) for everything else. You will always get the best focus effect for the particular spell you are casting.<br />
<br />
FYI Elemental Gloves are 1-25%, so they average 13% Mana reduction (with MUCH better stats than Ornate gloves as well)</div></div><hr />
