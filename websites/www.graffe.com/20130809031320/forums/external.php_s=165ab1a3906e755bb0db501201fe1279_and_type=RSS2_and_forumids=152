			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've been making jerky with basically the same recipe since 1989.  If I remember right, it came from an old late-70s version of the recipe/camping book &quot;Roughing It Easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Since moving in with my fiancee, I've started to take liberties with what I'm creating.<br />
<br />
The first batch I made after my fiancee gifted me a Nesco dehydrator for Christmas was that standard recipe - basically soy sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire, garlic (powder), black pepper, liquid smoke (if desired.)<br />
<br />
It came out great - but we wanted something ... more.<br />
<br />
So when I picked up almost 12 lbs of London Broil (not usually ideal or first choice jerky meat, but it had fantastic fat marbling) and we had a weekend trip with 8+ hours' driving (one way) ahead of us, I decided to improvise.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/BatlFIU.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I ended up making 5 batches of jerky(pic)</a>.  The only thing I regret at the moment is that I eyeballed everything so cannot give exact measurements.<br />
<br />
Batches 1 and 5 (hidden in the back right, the top large square Lock'n'Lock, and another below it) were different variations of the original recipe.<br />
<br />
<b>The primary batch, approximately 4 lbs' meat, was:</b><br />
<br />
Soy Sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire, garlic and onion powder, a smidgen of paprika, and a tiny bit of wild blueberry honey.  We called this &quot;alt soy&quot; because it didn't follow the original recipe.<br />
<br />
<b>The fifth batch, around 3 lbs' meat, was:</b><br />
<br />
Soy sauce, pressed garlic, sliced garlic, brown sugar, liquid smoke, black pepper.  This was much closer to the &quot;original&quot; recipe so it's the &quot;reg soy&quot; version.<br />
<br />
The other three batches though were much more unconventional for us.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 2 - Spicy, which used the least amount of beef, due to my not liking spicy and not wanting to waste meat on a supreme screwup</b><br />
<br />
Soy sauce, worcestershire, and equal parts Louisiana Hot Sauce, juice from a jar of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giardiniera" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mixed Vegetable Giardiniera</a>, and juice from a jar of mild sliced banana peppers, plus a heaping quarter teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper, and maybe an eigth of a teaspoon of white pepper.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 3, which we called Sweet and Sour:</b><br />
<br />
Equal parts White Grape Juice (cheapy Wal-mart brand, oddly) and pickle juice (Mt. Olive Kosher Dill), garlic powder, onion powder, and a tiny bit of liquid smoke (just enough for color) and white pepper.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 4, which became Sweet and Spiced:</b><br />
<br />
Low-acid low-pulp Orange Juice, a good two tablespoons wild blueberry honey, LOTS of fresh cracked black pepper, white pepper, and only a little garlic and onion powder.<br />
<br />
Each batch was left to marinate for 24-28 hours, mixed/shaken several times, then dehydrated for 6-7 hours at 160 (°F), then 6-8 hours at 120 (°F) (sleep period, then work shift).<br />
<br />
Results of the various batches (out of order for emphasis):<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 1</b> - Alt Soy - we liked the stronger soy/meaty marinade flavor of this one<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 5</b> - Reg Soy - the garlic flavor was much more pronounced due to the fresh garlic.  Definitely not something to complain about<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 4</b> - Sweet n Spiced - very good.  The orange juice gave it an unexpected silkiness that played well with the spiced aura.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 2</b> - Spicy - it was good, but came out weaker than I expected.  I was actually able to eat it (when I can't usually handle spicy jerky) but it gives me a basis for which to craft a more spicy version for m'Lady later on.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 3</b> - Sweet and Sour - I don't know where to start with this.  This is the &quot;unexpected success&quot; to which the thread title refers.  This jerky tastes EXACTLY like a fresh-off-the-wrapper McDonald's Hamburger.  It's so crazy good that we are forcing ourselves to reserve it and eat it only a piece at a time so as not to run out too fast!<br />
<br />
If I'm able to recreate these, I'll make sure to keep track of actual measurement amounts for posting purposes.</div>
