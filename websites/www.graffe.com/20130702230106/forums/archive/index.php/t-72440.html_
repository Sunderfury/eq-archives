Light doesn't always make everything colorful. Some kinds of lights in different parts of the world (or lights at night) can drain the color off surfaces. <br />
<br />
It looks like a cartoon, now. <br />
<br />
I know Western RPGs are criticized for &quot;too much brown&quot; but give me a break.<br />
<br />
I'm keeping an eye on mods, and I am taking requests for (serious and lore-friendly) content mods, since it's a big niche to fill and I happen to be one of the people skilled enough to do them.</div></div><hr />

yeah it's a matter of taste, hence that mod also has de-saturate as a choice! :)<br />
I just love uber vibrance<br />
<br />
map mod (not a mod really just INI tweak) is, IMHO, one that the damn game should have as the DEFUALT setting, sheesh!<br />
despite what some folk say I adore the 3D map, as a DM and lover of geography and exploring it's awesome :)<br />
just needs the roads highlighted IMHO, now THAT would be a good mod, S-D,simply having soft glowing lines or such, showing roads on the map, set it so the road effect scales so it doesn't obscure the map as you zoom in close</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
According to the Bethesda forums, the game was patched today and you can no longer make the game LAA as the game won't launch with it, much like FONV does when trying to directly make the exe LAA. Kinda retarded the developers don't make the exes LAA by default, sucks that Steam doesn't like you messing with them. There is something for FONV that allowed it, but it worked by running some other exe and injecting the code into FONV while it was running or something instead of just using the simple 4GB patch.  <br />
<br />
That sucks for people wanting the better textures...</div></div><hr />

<br />
note that there seems to be a bug with Lydia, folk say she doesnt' gain stats etc when she levels up<br />
to fix it<br />
target her up close<br />
open the console (tilde key on PC)<br />
type:<br />
disable<br />
and hit enter<br />
<br />
then type<br />
enable<br />
and hit enter<br />
it resets her to your current level (so may need repeated?)<br />
I don't know if it may cause other issues though, caveat emperator!</div></div><hr />

 I found it better to undo this change to the Skyrim.ini file I posted earleir as it was making load times WAY longer in combination with the 4gb tweak<br />
<br />
so, undo this only if you use the LAA tweak or find load times get waaay to high, or use other forms of large addres aware tweaks<br />
<br />
<br />
Open skyrim.ini, and check for [Papyrus] section. If it's not present, just create one at the end of the file. <br />
Add iMinMemoryPageSize=100000 and iMaxMemoryPageSize=5000000 <br />

<br />
<br />
How it Works:<br />
It stores your character info in separate folders under the &quot;My Games\Skyrim&quot; folder in your &quot;My Documents&quot; folder. This allows you to switch easily between characters.<br />
<br />
Pre-installation:<br />
If you already have multiple characters in the &quot;Saves&quot; folder, then you will have to manually sort the save files into distinct folders before you run it. <br />
<br />
If you have to seperate your characters like this then make sure the last save is not an auto or quicksave just to be sure. I'd also recommend making a backup first.<br />
<br />
This task shouldn't be too difficult because the saves generally have the name of each character (except autosave and quick save).<br />
<br />
Once this is done, name the folders according to your character, but leave at least one character folder named &quot;Saves&quot;, this will be needed when the program first runs.</div></div><hr />

A lot of those changes illustrate what I hate about people implementing tweaks.  Other than Ambient Occlusion, and the further distance for detail, most of them make the game look worse, not better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I found a GREAT graphic mod<br />
<br />
SKYRIM ENHANCED SHADERS<br />
now, it come sin *two* flavours, please note this, they are nto compatible, only use one or other<br />
<br />
1st is HDR, this is one I recommend! it adds proper dynamic lighting/shadows, makes nights actually dark, caves lot of dakr areas etc<br />
looks awesome (alas of course since it's post process, normal screenshots cannot show it, sigh)<br />
Also lets you see your FPS (hit the * key on numeric keypad)<br />
http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=822<br />
<br />
<br />
AND it is compatible with my fave visual mod mod, FXAA Post Process Injector (with a little work, it shows you how ot add a line of text to file to enable this, and rename a .dll file)<br />
http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=131<br />
<br />
So now I get saturated bright colours and dynamic lighting, superb!<br />
Now I just need the damn FPS fixed, lol. Oh well, Xmas money = new vid card, sod it<br />
<br />
The second version of Skyrim Enhanced Shaders is kind of like FXAA Post Process Injector mod, allowing varied colour schemes but different and also dynmic in how they respond ot current lighting etc, the cinematic one looks lovely IMHO. One day I hope he cna combine the HDR and Cinematic mods<br />
<br />
<br />
Also got Skyrim HD textures mod<br />
http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=607<br />
really good moslty though he's made rugs too rough IMHO, but definate improvement.<br />
<br />
so currently with the patch f*ck up of FPS, and these mods, my frame rate slammed down to 10/per second on my 240GT card, lol!! not playable but looks amazing<br />
<br />
Oh also had the Enahnced Night Sky (blue version) for while which is nice, found full coloured one way too garish/flat looking<br />

Steam automatically downloads and applies the patch.  Sometimes it's not immediately applied but requires a restart of the Steam app.  But usually it is.</div></div><hr />

What happens next goes something like this:<br />
<br />
Guardsman herpaderps right in front of me while aiming his bow, takes a fireball to the backside.<br />
All Guardsmen: &quot;Stop, Dragonborn!&quot;<br />
All of the town's guardsmen ignore the 80-ton fire-breathing thunderlizard, and kill me in a hail of arrows before I can even lower my hands to try and yield.<br />

<br />
Not at all.  Imagine if your monitor was just a frame.  If you held the frame really close to your face, you would be able to see a huge angle to either side.  If you held the screen back a few feet, the angle you could see would be much smaller.  That is what causes problems with the FOV: When you're drastically outside of the distance your brain expects for the angle, it can cause headaches, or nausea.</div></div><hr />

I changed it to 90, which to me is much more comfortable on a widescreen monitor. But if you crank it up too much, you end up with something akin to tunnel vision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't imagine playing without at least the visible ore veins mods (for a character that has any need for blacksmithing, anyway). My brother plays Skyrim on the PS3, and was astounded when I told him I had actually found enough ore to get my smithing to 100.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eniarch</div><div class="date">February 9th, 2012, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never did any smithing besides the first couple of newbie tasks. As a mage, I never saw the point. Especially since I accidentally became Arch Mage early on and pretty much kept that robe until the end of the game (switched occasionally for the thieves guild armor for carrying capacity).Well, the most obvious case is for companion gear. Most mages are taking a heavier combat companion along, and being able to hand them a set of highly honed and improved gear does make a pronounced difference, IMO. Better bows give them better standoff capability, better armor means fewer reloads and less healing drains, better melee weapons give them the means to help out with overrunning hordes. Since the companions have adopted the FO3/NV equipment selection system, they'll equip and benefit from your output. (This also applies to enchanting, obviously.)<br />
<br />
Improved backup weapons (if you're not using daedric spells) and using improved armor (often boots/gauntlets/helm) to fill out an outfit of mage clothing can provide some benefits. (Less so, if you're taking Alteration perks that work only when not wearing armor items.) Often early on, I'm carrying a sharpened dagger or one-hand sword, and an improved bow, even though I'm a mage. (Mana's not infinite, and bows can sneak attack at range!) Later, the ability to improve enchanted weapons and armor can give you the ability to improve even fairly powerful items you want to use. (I spent time improving the bow I got during the DB assassination missions, frex.)<br />
<br />
Improved items sell for a little more money, and it's not hard to have large quantities of ore saved up if you stop into every mine you find and mine every ore vein you find (even if you won't use it). What's a companion for, if not to carry my pickaxe, woodcutter's axe, shovel, crowbar, and kitchen sink like a good little pack mule?<br />
<br />
Finally, there's the &quot;I'm going to take that dragon, drag it out of the sky, eat its soul and forge arms and armor from its body&quot; factor, which may or may not matter to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yaxa</div><div class="date">February 9th, 2012, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, all of that makes sense, but I never really needed any of that. I never even used a companion for more than a handful of quests besides the ones where you automatically get one.<br />
<br />
I'll probably adopt a radically different play style the second time, but that's unlikely to happen until they release some chunky DLC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eniarch</div><div class="date">February 9th, 2012, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, all of that makes sense, but I never really needed any of that.I honestly don't think any character needs it with the auto-scaling in place. There are plenty of options for alternatives to smithing/enchanting, like finding artifacts. It's just a question of whether it fits your character (or if you're a min-maxing little munchkin - guilty as charged, I am).<br />
<br />
Frankly, I found having to find ore tedious and ended up buying what I could, travelling to cities with a blacksmith in a circuit to buy out their stocks. I doubt very much that all of my resales even allowed me to break even. I too, am looking forward to some chunky DLC. <br />
<br />
But there's more that they could have done before launch and didn't. (http://kotaku.com/5883580/kinect+enabled-shouts-and-dragon-mounts-will-skyrims-game-jam-experiments-ever-see-the-light-of-day/gallery/1) I'd wager some of this stuff includes things you'd have liked to have seen pre-DLC (or as upgrades).</div></div><hr />

Holy Crap, he touted the skills interface as good design. /facepalm Maybe they should have wasted less time on the travesty that is the skills page and put in some of that other cool stuff he was talking about.

 <br />
There's Adult Show XXX, which I haven't really been interested in enough to try, and then there's Animated Prostitution - which I'm sure is a port of the same Fallout 3 and Fallout NV mods of the same name.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I think these mods are just too much. There have been mods that had good dialogue written for them that are actually quite sexy, but so many other mods are just complete pornographic schlock.</div></div><hr />

Whew...ok... maybe I won't try to kill any bears for a while. I'm pretty much a complete noob, but the best way to learn is to explore and try new things out! So let's go exploring! <br />
<br />
&lt;~10 hours of fun&gt;<br />

Hey, there's a hole in the ground over there. &quot;The sightless pit?&quot; That sounds interesting. Spoooooooon! Hmm, I won't be able to get out. That's ok though, for I am mighty and that goblin thing wasn't too hard. La la la --- Ooooh, Temple of Xrib. And... <br />

Whew, well, I managed to kill the goblin thing AND his weird earwig thing friend, but I had to use my summon scroll. Press on!<br />

HOLY CRAP 5 GOBLIN THINGS AT ONCE ARRRGH<br />

I've logged almost 140 hours and managed never to stumble across it. Lucy, I got some 'splorin' to do!</div></div><hr />

It's easy to miss... and it's been a while since I played Skyrim, but if I recall correctly it was in the Winterhold area... maybe east of there?  Not sure.  It's just a hole in the ground and I probably would have missed it if Lydia didn't say &quot;Oh look, a cave, wonder what's in there?&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

(I made it out; a friend explained how to use stealth to split groups; it probably took me ~1hr to sneak through everything!)</div></div><hr />
