Surgeons in Georgia claim to have replaced a man's cancer-ridden penis with one of his fingers in the first operation of its kind. 
 
The 50-year-old man had his penis amputated and replaced with a middle finger - complete with knuckles. 
 
Doctors say the seventeen-hour operation has been successful, and the man's two girlfriends are happy with the result.

<br />
Surgeons in Georgia claim to have replaced a man's cancer-ridden penis with one of his fingers in the first operation of its kind.<br />
<br />
The 50-year-old man had his penis amputated and replaced with a middle finger - complete with knuckles.<br />
<br />
Doctors say the seventeen-hour operation has been successful, and the man's two girlfriends are happy with the result.<br />
<br />
Twelve days after the operation the man was able to go to the toilet normally, although it was slightly longer before he could manage sex.<br />
<br />
Ivan Kusanov, head of the plastic surgery clinic in Tiflis, says surgeons managed to fit a tube down the middle of the finger so the man could urinate.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a pioneering operation,&quot; he told theGerman press.<br />
He added that, in the twelve months since the man went under the knife, he has proved the finger-penis &quot;works perfectly well as a sex organ&quot;.<br />
<br />
He said the 50-year-old reported &quot;both of his girlfriends are more than satisfied with the results&quot;.<br />
<br />
The ground-breaking procedure is to be patented, and Georgian men will be charged around £3,500 for the operation.<br />
<br />
Foreign patients will be expected to pay more.<br />
