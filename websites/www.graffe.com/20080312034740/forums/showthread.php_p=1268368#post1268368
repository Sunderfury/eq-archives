1. Ancient Port Warehouse<br />
The Ancient Port Warehouse is Vanguards premiere raiding dungeon. It is a massive underground complex with many unique encounters. Ancient Port Warehouse is intended for the high end raiders in Vanguard and will feature end game adventuring, crafting and diplomacy content. <br />
<br />
In order to gain access to the Ancient Port Warehouse, adventurers must first eliminate the threat that is posed by the emergence of one of the dragons servants sent to scout the lands above. Kipcel the gnome stands before the Ancient Port Warehouse with his plea, answer it and access will be yours.<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Nestled beneath the Port of Innovus, the Ancient Port Warehouse of Thestra is a marvel of engineering and ancient crystal technology. A brilliant gnome inventor, Professor Hopton, designed and built the Warehouse for the Cartheon Empire over a thousand years ago. The warehouse was thought destroyed in the cataclysm, and its vast sum of treasures lost. <br />
With the arrival of the undead Cartheon legions on Thestran soil, the warehouse has been rediscovered. The Cartheon senator, Demetrius, seeks a relic of unimaginable power he knows to be hidden within: The Argent Coil. Should this powerful relic fall into Cartheon hands, it is only a matter of time before the kingdoms of Thestra are crushed. Only a band of worthy heroes can hope to stop Demetrius before it is too late. The Cartheons, however, are not the only dangers lurking within. <br />
The warehouse itself is protected by an army of colossal metal guardians gone haywire. Adventurers will also need to contend with the sinister Professor Vercel and his Metalheads, gnome warriors equipped with the latest crystal powered armor suits. Fortunately, some respite can be found with the benevolent Children of Hopton, who stand opposed to Vercel and are engaged with him in a bloody civil war. <br />
If the heroes are to win the race for The Argent Coil then they will have to ally with the Children of Hopton and stand against Professor Vercel and Senator Demetrius. Only then can they repair the warehouses core processor and acquire Professor Hoptons lost treasure  the only known protection against the breath of the mighty dragon, Kotasoth. Kotasoth, the present keeper of The Argent Coil, is a plague ridden and malevolent beast that has grown powerful through centuries of sleep, and feasting on those foolish enough to tread into the lowest depths of the warehouse. It is only through Kotasoths defeat that the The Argent Coil can be recovered and its threat to the free races of Telon eliminated. <br />
<br />

<br />
2. Overland Raids<br />
To complement Ancient Port Warehouse, we have also added two overland (i.e. not in a dungeon) raid encounters. Jagund Wavebreaker and the Prime Warden of Nusibe. These are for high end adventuring players.<br />
<br />
Jagund Wavebreaker<br />
Location: Oceanwatch<br />
Lore:<br />
For almost a thousand years, Jagund, the Wavebreaker, has ruled the northern sea of Thestra.  No ship has passed without his allowance, and all have either paid their dues, or been offered as sacrifice to the depths.  Deadly sirens hunt the northern sea with impunity, offering up their spoils to Jagund as tribute in return for his protection.<br />
<br />
In the aftermath of the sacking of Targonor by the Cartheons, the sirens fell upon those ships foolish enough to flee into the northern sea.  Dozens of ships were lulled into the rocks and sunk, their crews carried off by the sirens while their treasures were heaped as offerings to Jagund.  Among the treasures was Vaisas Horn, a relic of great power.<br />
<br />
Vaisa, the spirit of the deep waters, had long ago gifted the Horn to the Sages Arcane to protect the humans ships from Siharis wrath. Finding the Horn amongst the wreckage of a Sages Arcane ship, Jagund came to realize it was he, not Sihari, who could control the sea.<br />
<br />
For twenty years the Horn was thought lost by the Sages Arcane, returned to the depths from whence it came.  Now, Jagunds possession of the Horn has come to the attention of the Sages.  The siren Licosea brings news of Jagunds newfound mastery over the seas, and the growing army of the deep at his command.  Jagund must be stopped and the Horn recovered, or the tides of war will sweep all of Thestra away.<br />
<br />
Prime Warden of Nusibe<br />
Location: Nusibe Necropolis<br />
Lore:<br />
In ages long forgotten beneath the sands of Qalia the Tehatamani Empire flourished.  Hidden between the brutal dark elves of Stiirhad and the ever-expanding Ahgramun Empire, the Tehatamani pharaohs ruled their people with wisdom and compassion.  To safeguard their beloved pharaoh, the priesthood selected the most faithful and devout of their ranks to fulfill a time honored tradition of being the prime warden of the Tehatamani.<br />
<br />
The chosen ones would give themselves to the empire, offering up their life to a ritual sacrifice where their soul would be removed from their body and placed within the stone form of the Prime Warden.  The chosen would serve in this form until the pharaohs death, at which point they would accompany the pharaoh to the afterlife.<br />
<br />
Most notable amongst the chosen is Soleq SuBaht, last of the Prime Wardens.  Soleq was chosen to be Prime Warden of Pharaoh Nusibe, but in his service he was forced to do terrible deeds.  He slaughtered Nusibes enemies and preyed upon the Tehatamani people when Nusibe grew displeased.  He was Nusibes wrath, and he was powerless to oppose his masters call.  Only in Nusibes assassination was Soleq released from his servitude.<br />
<br />
The Tehatamani, eager to never suffer such horror again, abolished the ritual of the Prime Warden, and even abandoned the title of pharaoh to put Nusibes reign of terror behind them.  But now, with the theft of the Xakrins Ark of Ages, Nusibe has returned, and for some inexplicable reason, so too has Prime Warden Soleq.  Nusibes reign of terror is about to begin anew, and this time, the long knives of assassins cannot end it.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Raid Features &amp; Functionality<br />
Raids allow players to form a group or groups of players into a larger entity to accomplish goals that would otherwise not be possible with a single group.  A raid provides tools and facilitates a raid leader in managing a group of players that is usually much larger than a single group. <br />
<br />
With this update, we have added our new raiding system to Vanguard, the details are as follows:<br />
<br />
Raid Creation<br />
A raid is created when the group leader converts their group into a raid by issuing a slash command, clicking on a button in the raid window, or by selecting the option from the list of group options. Raid size will be dependant upon the encounter but may be up to 24 players in a raid.<br />
<br />
Raid Dissolution<br />
A raid is dissolved and becomes a normal group when there is 6 or fewer players in the raid and the raid leader coverts it back to a group.  This can be done by issuing the same command or button press to create the raid.<br />
<br />
Joining / Leaving Raid<br />
Players are invited to the raid in the same manner that they are invited to a group. The player invited to the raid has the option to accept or to decline the invite.<br />
<br />
Players can leave the raid at any time by simply leaving the group.<br />
<br />
If the raid leader leaves the raid, raid leadership is assigned to another player in the raid.<br />
<br />
Raid Ranks<br />
There are three pre-defined ranks that players can have in a raid.<br />
<br />
Raid Leader<br />
The raid leader is essentially the group leader but is called the raid leader after the group reaches more than the max group size limit. The raid leader invites other raid to the raid. They have the ability to change the ranks of other players in the raid; changes loot options of the raid, remove people from the raid, and make another person in the raid the raid leader.<br />
<br />
Raid Assistant<br />
A raid assistant has additional privileges that allow him to assist the raid leader. The raid assistant can invite additional players to the raid, move players around in the raid interface, and issue raid alerts.<br />
<br />
Raid Member<br />
A raid member has the ability to speak in the raid chat channel.<br />
<br />
Raid Chat<br />
A raid chat channel is created when the number of players in the group exceeds the single group size limit. The raid leader and raid officer chat names will be colored differently to denote their importance. Players may use /raid or /ra to type in the raid chat channel. <br />
<br />
Raid Icons<br />
A raid assistant and leader will have the ability to denote NPCs or other players with icons above their heads for easy recognition by the raid.<br />
<br />
Raid Looting<br />
Raid looting options will be identical to group loot options and can only be modified by the raid leader.<br />
<br />
Raid Questing<br />
When in a raid, players will not be able to complete general solo or group quests. Players in the raid will only be able to advance and complete quests specifically designated as raid quests.<br />
<br />
Raid Experience<br />
Raids will be able to gain experience similar to normal size groups by killing NPCs.  <br />
<br />
Raid Alert Text<br />
The raid leader and officers will have the ability to send alert text to members in the raid. This will be done through a chat slash command. (/raidalert)  This text will display in the center of the screen for all players in the raid along with an alert sound.<br />
<br />
Raid Ready Check<br />
The raid leader and officers will have the ability to send a request to all players in the raid to see if they are ready to proceed.  Players will be presented with a popup box presenting the request with the option of selecting Yes or No.<br />
<br />
Lockout System<br />
The lockout system prevents players from engaging an NPC if they have recently killed that NPC and the lockout timer has not expired.  <br />
<br />
The list of lockout timers can be seen by doing a /lockouttimerlist or clicking on the button in the raid interface.<br />
<br />
Raid Engagement<br />
When a raid engages an NPC, that NPC is now owned by the raid preventing any one else from interfering with their raid encounter.<br />
Players outside of a raid will not be able to heal players in a raid that are engaged with a raid NPC.<br />
Players invited to a raid after a raid NPC is engaged will not be able to assist the raid until those NPC's are killed or reset.<br />
Raid NPCs will have a limit on the number of players that can engage it.  Raids should only be created of the size as to the limit of the number of players the NPC can support.  <br />
<br />
<br />
4. Khal Revamp<br />
Khal gets a lot of foot (and ship!) traffic, and with that many people moving through the same area at a time, things tend to slow down a little bit. With that in mind, weve gone through and not only greatly improved the visual look and style of Qalias premiere port city but also optimized the art assets it uses, so that in addition to looking better it should perform better as well. Be sure to swing by and check it out!<br />
<br />
5. Optimizations (Character Occlusion)<br />
As always, we continue to work on further optimizing the game to improve player performance. To that end, with this update, we are implementing character occlusion. This feature will prevent a character from processing any animation, skinning, or rendering in situations where all parts of the object arent visible. In short, that means that if something is behind a wall and you cant see it, you wont need to take a performance hit from it. This should boost performance significantly in situations where there are many NPCs and PCs in an area that also contains many objects that can block out the visibility of the NPCs and PCs<br />
<br />
To toggle character occlusion, simply go to the video tab in the settings menu and check the box next to Character Occlusion. <br />
<br />
6. New Player Housing<br />
Six new player housing islands are now available! <br />
<br />
Each has their own crafting center and flying mount rental station, as well as other common player housing island facilities.<br />
<br />
Raveosiers Haven  Located off of Eastpoint <br />
Bleys Bluff  Located off of Serpantbone Coast. <br />
Conners Retreat  Located off of Sundering Wastelands. <br />
Gullos Grotto  Located off of Tawar Galan. <br />
Isle of Mann  Located off of Minds Crown. <br />
Lillys Sanctuary  Located off of Silius Flats. <br />
<br />
<br />
7. Holiday Content<br />
Towns and cities alike within the world of Telon are heartily preparing for the Festival of Gloriann! Once a year during the wintery months, the tale of Atnas Claws and his spirit of giving imbue the cities with an aura of goodness. Towering trees adorned with lights can be seen glittering within the cities of Telon. <br />
<br />
Be on the look out for an abundance of gifts and goodies! Those who have been extra nice may find their treats granting them something extra special!<br />
<br />
Take a tour over the rooftops of Telon while riding on Randolph, the flying reindeer.<br />
<br />
You too, can help spread the spirit of Glorian by decorating your own house or Guild Hall with numerous festive items, from neatly wrapped gifts to smiley faced snowman. We're not giving it all away, of course. Sometimes the best gift you can give is one of surprise! So make sure to log into game next week, gather your gifts and continue to spread the spirit of Glorian throughout Telon! <br />

<br />
CODING<br />
GENERAL<br />
- Fixed a bug with endurance regen from items. Unlike energy and hit point regen, endurance regen from items was unintentionally occurring every second.<br />
- There have been some changes to pvp antigroup behavior. Pressing escape will no longer drop the player out of pvp combat. The new requirements to remove yourself from pvp combat is to move farther than 50m away from every player that is aggro on you (they are on your encounter display).<br />
- Corpses will now decay while the player is online.<br />
- Removed the perception check for the target of target.<br />
- The LFG and LFM flags now default to off every time you log in, and the LFG flag will also be turned off when you get a group. Please remember to turn your LFG (looking for group) flag on when looking for a group, and group leaders should turn on their LFM (looking for more) flag when they want more group members to join them.<br />
- Offensive target buffs &amp; debuffs have been separated into 2 new windows.There is now an option to select which offensive target windows you want to see.  This can be accessed by going to the Main Menu, then to Settings, then clicking the Customize Windows button at the bottom of the Settings Screen. There is a vertical and a horizontal version for each of the windows. There will be more options coming soon to this window to allow you more customization of your interface.<br />
- The player's particle throttle sliders will now save and load their previous settings properly.<br />
- Fix for some occurrences of NPC &quot;civil wars&quot;. Some NPC abilities were causing other NPCs to think they were healing the player, causing a civil war.<br />
- Reactions are no longer canceled by hitting other non-reactions, some bugs with defensive reactions where the icon would be lit or unlit at the wrong time also fixed. Reactions that are not shared across forms when switching forms will be cancelled, but shared reactions will remain.<br />
- Ships will now despawn after 24 hours if no one is on them and their owner isn't in the chunk.<br />
- You can now filter out adventuring, crafting, or diplomacy quests in the quest tracker using three new options. These new options can be found with the other quest tracker options by opening the quest log/journal and clicking the &quot;Auto-Track&quot; button.<br />
- Increased the number of quests you can have from 20 to 50.<br />
- Items you receive will now prefer to go into any specialized equipped containers that they fit in, provided there are empty slots. So, if you buy crafting utilities they will go into your utility bag, arrows will go into your quiver, and things you harvest will go into special harvesting packs, etc... Note that tools are excepted from this, and they will just go into your general inventory as normal due to BOE issues that would arise if they automatically went into your toolbelts.<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing shadows to draw in multiple passes. This was causing a substantial performance hit in high quality mode.<br />
- Sped up detailed shadows by not redrawing their texture when the shadow-casting character isn't viewable. Instead, the shadows will remain in the shape of the last-animated character's position.<br />
- Added a new optimization setting &quot;Character Occlusion&quot;. Enabling Character Occlusion will speed up scenes where there are many characters around the player, but few are visible (such as if there is a wall between your view and a group of characters). If no part of a character draws on your screen, it will stop animating, it will stop updating its shadows, and it will stop rendering.<br />
- The length of the guild description / recruitment notes has been doubled due to popular request.<br />
- Using a Mez may no longer result in a proc.<br />
- Diplomacy and Crafting quests now show &quot;(Diplomacy)&quot; or &quot;(Crafting)&quot; after the name of the quest to distinguish them from adventuring quests. Longer term we would like to do this with different icons, but this was a quick way to help players see the difference in the short term.<br />
- Stun effects on NPC's now set ability recovery timer as though it was a successful cast<br />
- There have been some changes to pvp antigroup behavior.  Pressing escape will no longer drop the player out of pvp combat.  The new requirements to remove yourself from pvp combat is to move farther than 50m away from every player that is aggro on you (they are on your encounter display).<br />
- The player's particle throttle sliders will now save and load their previous settings properly.<br />
- Fixed a graphics card memory leak.<br />
- Separated see invis and see stealth on NPCs.<br />
- Items will now display their Item Level when appropriate.<br />
- The length of the guild description / recruitment notes has been doubled due to popular request.<br />
- Using a Mez may no longer result in a proc.<br />
- Raised the flight ceiling for flying mounts.<br />
- Adjusted camera angles for flying mounts. This should help players take better screenshots of themselves flying around. <br />
<br />
CLIENT<br />
- Fixed a fairly frequent, longstanding client crash.<br />
- Increased autofollow range to 50meters. <br />
- Made it so autofollow no longer breaks when switching defensive targets. It will now always go off of the target you had when you issued the /follow command.<br />
- Fixed a performance issue with the client map<br />
- Fixed a login crash<br />
- The travel journal location tracking indicator on the compass now blinks when you select a new location.<br />
<br />
SERVER<br />
- Fixed a social server crash<br />
- Added dozens of server-side optimizations to reduce lag, a great deal of which is due to the help of our players on the Test Server! <br />
<br />
UI<br />
- Important for Custom UI's. VGUIHarvestingBonusYield.xml has been removed and its contents have been moved into VGUIHarvestingDisplay.xml.<br />
- There is a new option in the settings window to toggle Vertical Sync on/off<br />
- There is a new option in the settings window to toggle Triple Buffering on/off.<br />
- The location/quest tracking indicator on the compass no longer completely disappears when you are facing away from the location it is trying to guide you to.  It now just stops at the left or right edge to let you know which way you should turn to find it.<br />
- The travel journal location tracking indicator on the compass now blinks when you select a new location.<br />
- Implemented UI optimizations that should speed up performance on the UI all around.<br />
- Implemented UI window for the /claim command.
