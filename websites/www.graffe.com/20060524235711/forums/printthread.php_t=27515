		<div>Hi everyone.<br />
<br />
Ive been playing an ogre warrior lately. My RL friend has been playing a dwarf cleric. Last night before we logged off, we sat down and compared numbers like hps/AC with and without buffs to get an idea of exactly what stats we have in certain situations.<br />
<br />
Some strange things happened when we started comparing attack numbers. My friend (the cleric) has an attack score of 238 using his two handed staff. Using the sword that I normally use, I have an attack of about 226. Switching to a hammer (similar stats to my sword) I got an attack of about 175 or something. We considered that maybe two handed weapons get a bonus to attack, so I borrowed my friends staff, and using that I still had an attack of about 225. No matter what I did, my attack never went above 230. We even tried clicking on/off all the different buffs we use at different times and it didnt seem to change anything.<br />
<br />
This seems illogical does it not? Surely an ogre warrior should have a higher attack score than a dwarf cleric?<br />
<br />
Obviously there are other factors to be considered, so here they are. Im level 17 atm, the cleric is level 16. My strength is considerably higher, and my agility is marginally higher. My Hammer and sword skill both read 90/90 while the clerics skill reads 85/85. My &quot;weaponry&quot; skill reads 26/26 while the clerics skill reads 24/24.<br />
<br />
Putting this data togethor, It seems that I should have more bonuses since I seem to have higher stats in everything that should matter. Yet my attack is lower.... in the case of a hammer considerably lower.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain these observations to me? It just doesnt seem to make sense.<br />
<br />
Why am I so bad at attacking with a hammer?<br />
<br />
Why is a cleric better at attacking than me at all?</div>

		<div>Are you truly bad? Is he truly better? How do you 2 compare in an actual combat situation?<br />
<br />
 <br />
I ask because in EQ1, stats meant different things depending on class, so a 50 Wizard and a 50 Warrior with the same AC and attack rating would fare worlds apart in hand to hand combat.</div>

		<div>Thats a good point. I havent actually parsed our effectiveness etc. Even in EQ1 though, My wizard had a much lower attack score than an ogre warrior due to his higher strength, dexterity, weapon skill etc etc. This was in addition to the fact that even with the same attack scores I would have been less effective due to being a wizard.<br />
<br />
I mean its not that big of a deal to me. I can hold agro without much trouble even with my low damage output... damaging the mobs is not my job (especially since Im going to go guardian) but I would like to understand things.</div>

		<div>Yea I think we are all still trying to understand what goes on under the covers.<br />
<br />
 <br />
I was trying to make the point that we know in EQ1 that AC is not AC is not AC, the same may hold true for attack scores in EQ2, although one would think they would just adjust the numbers to reflect the &quot;reality&quot; of the situation.</div>
