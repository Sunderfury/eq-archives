</div>Just as one counter example would disprove &quot;never made this way&quot;? But &quot;the other side&quot; won't let go of that chestnut, will they?<br />
<br />
But let's make this about what it's really about. Dmitry, I understand that you're upset that religion doesn't get the same protection at Graffe's as things like sexual orientation. Religion is the original free speech issue, and that it was left out of rule 4 is very odd. If you wandered on over to &quot;Site And Forum Administration&quot;, and started the ball rolling as set out in <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?59137-How-to-change-posting-rules" target="_blank">http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthr...-posting-rules</a>. , I think you'd find that many people would support you. I would, and I was the one who started the &quot;Young Earth Creationism&quot; thread. But you cannot reasonably expect the mods to enforce rules that don't exist. The constant trolling makes it look like you have no actual point, but are rather a homophobe looking for rules-lawyer ways to spew hate. Propose the rule changes you want before everybody tunes you out.</blockquote>

</div>This still feels like an argument you want to be having with someone else. I readily admit self description never occurred to me. If you read any of the transgender threads you will see that I'm a very simple person and the whole identity issue is above my head.<br />
<br />
You have a tendency to link your arguments with things you know are offensive to rile people up and catch them off guard. In this case you are making use of the belief that people aren't born gay, and are simply pretending to be for one social reason or another.<br />
<br />
Buy if you ignore all the baggage and think about it logically, the presence of one choice implies that there must be another. If you can choose to be gay then you can choose to be straight, not everyone is capable of this, and those that are are defined with a certain word. <br />
<br />
Although if you want to get technical, this word isn't quite adequate either, but I can't choose to be gay any more than someone else can choose to be straight. Kudos for those that can, but their existence does not nullify the experiences of everyone else. It just means people are diverse and you cannot easily sort them between two binary categories.</blockquote>

I think choices do come into play and that they are influenced by a combination of genetics and environment.  Hard to separate the two from what we all end up becoming.  We never have to be slaves to our genetic make up. People successfully fight what their genes tell them they need to be all the time.  Thank goodness, because there are things people's genes tell them to do that are downright harmful to them and sometimes to others, not including being gay.  Environment versus heredity.  Both are equally strong factors in a person's life.<br />

</div>Yup. I've read studies like this before and it only strengthens the point: Men have no control over what they are turned on by - and women are sometimes so disconnected they don't even realise what turns them on; so given that your sexual orientation is determined by what turns you on rather than who you sleep with it's obviously even less of a choice for them.<br />
 <br />
(Of course, not that it's news to anyone who's ever been in a relationship that being turned on is a much more complicated process for women than for men - involving sometimes disconnected physical, emotional and intellectual drives. This study obviously only considered the physical side. <br />
<br />
Still, guys have much simpler knobs and switches than women (PI). If there's two lovers and the man is playing too much EQ and the woman wants sex, all she has to do is walk up to the computer, slowly take off all her clothes and announce she'll be in the bedroom. A guy doing the same thing with a woman playing too much EQ would get laughed at :p (Although she will sometimes also buy it!))</blockquote>

I've read studies like this before and it only strengthens the point: Men have no control over what they are turned on by - and women are sometimes so disconnected they don't even realise what turns them on; so given that your sexual orientation is determined by what turns you on rather than who you sleep with it's obviously even less of a choice for them.</div>

</div>I would simply say that women are stimulated differently than men.  They may not realize when their genitals are stimulated, and their genitals are equipped to be ready for many kinds of sexual activity whether there is a conscious desire or not.  What motivates the conscious desire is unknown.<br />

			Diamond is a tireless researcher. The study that led to her book has been going on for more than 10 years. During that time, she has followed the erotic attractions of nearly 100 young women who, at the start of her work, identified themselves as either lesbian or bisexual or refused a label. From her analysis of the many shifts they made between sexual identities and from their detailed descriptions of their erotic lives, <b>Diamond argues that for her participants, and quite possibly for women on the whole, desire is malleable, that it cannot be captured by asking women to categorize their attractions at any single point, that to do so is to apply a male paradigm of more fixed sexual orientation.</b> Among the women in her group who called themselves lesbian, to take one bit of the evidence she assembles to back her ideas, just one-third reported attraction solely to women as her research unfolded. And with the other two-thirds, the explanation for their periodic attraction to men was not a cultural pressure to conform but rather a genuine desire.

</div>Also, I don't think that these studies included self-identified male bisexuals.  I know they exist but have no idea whether they are straights or gays who simply act occasionally against their instincts.</blockquote>
