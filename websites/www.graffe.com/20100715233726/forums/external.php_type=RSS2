			Tinkerbell is getting ready to take flight at Disney in &quot;Tink,&quot; a live-action romantic comedy that has Elizabeth Banks attached to star and Adam Shankman, Jennifer Gibgot and McG guiding the pic's flightplan to the bigscreen as producers.<br />
<br />
Concept for the project, for which the deals are being wrapped up, plays with the mischievous nature of the Tinkerbell character. It was developed by Banks with Max Handelman, who co-runs the thesp's production shingle, Brownstone Prods., and Matt Smith of Offspring Entertainment. Offspring, the shingle run by Shankman and Gibgot, is based on the Disney lot. McG and Mary Viola will produce through their Wonderland Entertainment banner.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth Wright Shapiro, who helped develop the project, along with McG, will write the script.<br />
<br />
Credit Smith for getting so many filmmakers aflutter over &quot;Tink.&quot;<br />
<br />
The development exec initially worked with Banks and Handelman on the project while at Wonderland and continued to champion the pic after moving to Offspring.<br />
<br />
Shapiro and Banks have collaborated on projects in the past. They include &quot;Keiko,&quot; to which Banks is attached to direct. Shapiro will write and star in the pic. Scribe is also set to guest star in FX's &quot;The League&quot; and appear in Ruben Fleischer's &quot;30 Minutes or Less.&quot; Ted Hope and Anne Carrey's This Is That will produce &quot;Keiko.&quot; <br />
<br />
Scribe also penned &quot;Allies With Benefits,&quot; which Scott Free is set to produce. <br />
<br />
Project is the latest from Banks' shingle to land a home at a studio. <br />
<br />
Banks' Brownstone shingle most recently produced Disney's sci-fi thriller &quot;The Surrogates,&quot; with Mandeville Films. It also has &quot;Forever 21&quot; at DreamWorks and &quot;Pitch Perfect,&quot; at Universal.<br />
<br />
Banks stars in Paul Haggis' &quot;The Next Three Days,&quot; opposite Russell Crowe, and &quot;The Details,&quot; with Tobey Maguire. She is filming the comedy &quot;My Idiot Brother&quot; and will continue to guest on NBC's &quot;30 Rock.&quot;<br />
<br />
She is repped by UTA and Untitled Entertainment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tink&quot; becomes the second high-profile pic Offspring has set up in days, following a workplace laffer starring Zac Efron that it will produce at Warner Bros. and Efron's production shingle, Ninjas Runnin' Wild. It has &quot;Step Up 3D&quot; and &quot;Going the Distance&quot; bowing from Disney and New Line in August.

			An Iranian scientist who said he was kidnapped by the CIA has said he was subjected to extreme mental and physical torture by the Americans.<br />
<br />
Shahram Amiri, who has flown from the US to Tehran, also denied being heavily involved in Iran's nuclear programme.<br />
<br />
He disappeared last year and resurfaced this week in the Pakistani embassy in Washington asking to be repatriated.<br />
<br />
The US said he had been in the country &quot;of his own free will&quot; and denied he was tortured.<br />

<br />
Wearing a beige suit, a smiling Mr Amiri was greeted at Tehran's international airport early on Thursday morning by his tearful son and wife, along with other family members and Deputy Foreign Minister Hassan Qashqavi.<br />
<br />
Speaking at a news conference afterwards, he repeated his earlier claims that he had been abducted by US agents while undertaking the Hajj pilgrimage in the Saudi Arabian city of Medina.<br />
<br />
Mr Amiri said he was placed under intense pressure by his interrogators to co-operate in the first months following his alleged kidnapping.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was under the harshest mental and physical torture,&quot; he said, adding that Israeli agents had been present during the interrogations and that the CIA had offered him $50m (£32.8m) to remain in the US.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Americans wanted me to say that I defected to America of my own will to use me for revealing some false information about Iran's nuclear work. But with God's will, I resisted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Amiri offered no evidence, but said he would eventually.<br />

&quot;I have some documents proving that I've not been free in the United States and have always been under the control of armed agents of US intelligence services.&quot;<br />
<br />
He also denied he had been heavily involved in Iran's nuclear programme, saying he was a &quot;simple researcher who was working at a university&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not involved in any confidential jobs. I had no classified information.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had nothing to do with the Natanz and Fordo sites,&quot; he said, referring to Iran's two uranium enrichment plants.<br />
<br />
Unconfirmed reports that he worked for Iran's atomic energy organisation were &quot;a tool the US government brought up for political pressure&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mr Qashqavi thanked the scientist for his &quot;resistance to pressure&quot;.<br />
<br />
He rejected suggestions that Mr Amiri's return was linked to a possible deal to release three US hikers who have been detained in Iran since 2009.<br />
'Breakdown'<br />
<br />
In the US, unnamed officials and security sources said that Mr Amiri defected and was put into a programme similar to a witness-protection scheme.<br />
<br />
Later, he apparently became concerned for family members he had left behind, had a breakdown and decided to return to Iran, US reports claim.<br />
Shahram Amiri is greeted by his family at Tehran's airport (15 July 2010) Shahram Amiri was greeted at Tehran's airport by his tearful son and wife<br />
<br />
A US official told the BBC: &quot;He provided useful information to the United States. The Iranians now have him. In terms of win-loss, it's not even a close call.&quot;<br />
<br />
The official said Mr Amiri was not held in the US against his will, had lived there freely and had chosen freely to return to Iran. <br />
<br />
In its online edition, The Washington Post newspaper quoted unnamed officials saying Mr Amiri had been working for the CIA for more than a year and was paid $5m (£3.3m).<br />
<br />
In June, the Iranian government announced that it had handed evidence to the US that the scientist had been abducted.<br />
<br />
It came shortly after Mr Amiri appeared in two videos posted on the internet giving conflicting stories about how he had arrived in the US.<br />
<br />
He said in the first that he had been kidnapped by CIA and Saudi agents while on a pilgrimage. In the second message, he said he had gone to the US to improve his education and was living freely in Arizona.<br />
<br />
In a third message posted on the internet later that month, Mr Amiri said he had escaped from US custody and was on the run in Virginia.<br />
<br />
In an interview with Iranian state Press TV before he left the US, Mr Amiri said he was in Medina when three men in a van posing as fellow pilgrims offered him a ride.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I sat down, the man in back held a gun toward me and told me to keep quiet,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;They took me to a secret place and injected me, and when I woke up I saw myself in a huge airplane,&quot; and was taken to the US.<br />
<br />
The US state department repeatedly denied it had kidnapped him, but never said that he was not in the country.<br />
<br />
However on Tuesday, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acknowledged publicly for the first time that the scientist was indeed in the US.

Due to our pro-torture stance under Cheney/Bush there is no way to repudiate this. The fact we haven't 100% closed Guantanamo also leaves Obama complicit. I'd say I 75% believe this man's statement.</div>

Does this sound familiar to anyone?<br />
<br />
Right now our site does this huge &quot;Loading&quot; animation on each postback which I hate and which I'm trying to get replaced.  Just changing the cursor would be ideal IMHO.<br />
<br />
I've seen code that will display the hourglass, but that's not what I'm looking for - I want an actual AJAX &quot;loading&quot; animation next to the mouse pointer.<br />
<br />
Help?</div>

		<hr />
		
			The Georgia Guidestones is a large granite monument in Elbert County, Georgia, USA. A message comprising ten guides is inscribed on the structure in eight modern languages, and a shorter message is inscribed at the top of the structure in four ancient languages' scripts: Babylonian, Classical Greek, Sanskrit, and Egyptian hieroglyphs.<br />
<br />
The structure is sometimes referred to as an &quot;American Stonehenge.&quot;[1] The monument is almost 20 feet (6.1 m) tall if the buried support stones are included, exactly 18 feet (5.5 m) otherwise[2], and made from six granite slabs weighing more than 240,000 pounds (110,000 kg) in all.[3] One slab stands in the center, with four arranged around it. A capstone lies on top of the five slabs, which are astronomically aligned. An additional stone tablet, which is set in the ground a short distance to the west of the structure, provides some notes on the history and purpose of the Guidestones.<br />
<br />
In June 1979, an unknown person or persons under the pseudonym R. C. Christian hired Elberton Granite Finishing Company to build the structure.[3] One popular hypothesis is that the patron's pseudonym may be a tribute to the legendary 14th-century founder of Rosicrucianism, Christian Rosenkreuz.[3]<br />
<br />
[edit] Inscriptions<br />
A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, and Russian.<br />
<br />
1.Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.<br />
2.Guide reproduction wisely - improving fitness and diversity.<br />
3.Unite humanity with a living new language.<br />
4.Rule passion - faith - tradition - and all things with tempered reason.<br />
5.Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.<br />
6.Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.<br />
7.Avoid petty laws and useless officials.<br />
8.Balance personal rights with social duties.<br />
9.Prize truth - beauty - love - seeking harmony with the infinite.<br />
10.Be not a cancer on the earth - Leave room for nature - Leave room for nature.[4]<br />
[edit] Explanatory tablet<br />
 <br />
The explanatory tablet, immediately west of the edifice.A few feet to the west of the artifact, an additional granite ledger has been set level with the ground. This tablet identifies the structure and the languages used on it, lists various facts about the size, weight, and astronomical features of the stones, the date it was installed, and the sponsors of the project. It also speaks of a time capsule buried under the tablet, but the positions on the stone reserved for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and is to be opened are missing, so it is not clear whether the time capsule was ever put in place. Each side of the tablet is perpendicular to one of the cardinal directions, and is inscribed so that the northern edge is the &quot;top&quot; of the inscription.<br />
<br />
The complete text of the explanatory tablet is detailed below. The accompanying image shows the overall layout. The tablet is somewhat inconsistent with respect to punctuation, and also misspells &quot;pseudonym&quot;. The original spelling, punctuation, and line breaks in the text have been preserved in the transcription which follows.<br />
<br />
At the center of each tablet edge is a small circle, each containing a letter representing the appropriate compass direction (N, S, E, W).<br />
<br />
At the top center of the tablet is written:<br />
<br />
The Georgia Guidestones<br />
Center cluster erected March 22, 1980<br />
<br />
Immediately below this is the outline of a square, inside which is written:<br />
<br />
Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason<br />
<br />
Around the edges of the square are written the names of four ancient languages, one per edge. Starting from the top and proceeding clockwise, they are:<br />
<br />
Babylonian cuneiform<br />
Classical Greek<br />
Sanskrit<br />
Egyptian hieroglyphics<br />
On the left side of the tablet is the following column of text:<br />
<br />
Astronomic Features<br />
1. channel through stone<br />
indicates celestial pole.<br />
2. horizontal slot indicates<br />
annual travel of sun.<br />
3. sunbeam through capstone<br />

<br />
Time Capsule<br />

On<br />
To Be Opened on<br />
<br />
The words appear as shown under the time capsule heading; no dates are engraved.<br />
<br />
[edit] Physical data<br />
On the right side of the tablet is the following column of text:<br />
<br />
PHYSICAL DATA<br />
<br />

[edit] Astronomical features<br />
The four outer stones are oriented to mark the limits of the 18.6 year lunar declination cycle.[2] The center column features a hole through which the North Star can be seen regardless of time, as well as a slot that is aligned with the Sun's solstices and equinoxes. A 7/8&quot; aperture in the capstone allows a ray of sun to pass through at noon each day, shining a beam on the center stone indicating the day of the year.[3]<br />
<br />
[edit] Location<br />
34°13&#8242;55&#8243;N 82°53&#8242;40&#8243;W&#65279; / &#65279;34.231984°N 82.894506°W&#65279; / 34.231984; -82.894506<br />
<br />
The Georgia Guidestones are located on a hilltop in Elbert County, Georgia, approximately 90 miles (140 km) east of Atlanta, 45 miles (72 km) from Athens, and 9 miles (14 km) north of the center of Elberton. The stones are standing on a rise a short distance to the east of Georgia Highway 77 (Hartwell Highway), and are visible from that road. Small signs beside the highway indicate the turnoff for the Guidestones, which is identified by a street sign as &quot;Guidestones Rd.&quot; It is located on the highest point in Elbert County.<br />
<br />
[edit] Ownership<br />
Elbert County owns the Georgia Guidestones site. Robert C. Christian deeded the five acres to the county immediately upon purchase from Wayne Mullenix.[2] According to the Georgia Mountain Travel Association's detailed history: &quot;The Georgia Guidestones are located on the farm of Mildred and Wayne Mullenix...&quot;[5] The Elbert County land registration system shows what appears to be the Guidestones as County land purchased on October 1, 1979. [6][7]<br />
<br />
The monument was unveiled in March 1980, with the presence of 100 people.[8] Another account specifies the 22nd of March and said 400 people attended.[2][3]<br />
<br />
[edit] Reactions<br />
In his article, &quot;Decoding the Georgia Guidestones&quot;, Van Smith identifies three potential candidates as the true identity of R.C. Christian (Joe H. Fendley Sr., Dr. Francis Merchant, and Ted Turner). In the end, Smith concludes that Ted Turner is the most likely candidate for being R.C. Christian, stating, &quot;Our investigation into the identity of Robert C. Christian has uncovered highly persuasive yet circumstantial evidence linking Robert Edward “Ted” Turner to the very center of the Georgia Guidestones originators. This evidence is so strong that we believe Ted Turner probably was R.C. Christian. At the very least, Turner probably knows who R.C. Christian is.&quot; [2]<br />
<br />
Yoko Ono and others have praised the inscribed messages as &quot;a stirring call to rational thinking&quot;, while opponents have labeled them as the &quot;Ten Commandments of the Antichrist&quot;.[3]<br />
<br />
The Guidestones have become a subject of interest for conspiracy theorists. One of them, an activist named Mark Dice, demanded that the Guidestones &quot;be smashed into a million pieces, and then the rubble used for a construction project&quot;,[9] claiming that the Guidestones are of &quot;a deep Satanic origin,&quot; and that R. C. Christian, belongs to &quot;a Luciferian secret society&quot; related to the New World Order.[3] At the unveiling of the monument, a local minister proclaimed that he believed the monument was &quot;for sun worshipers, for cult worship and for devil worship&quot;.[8]<br />
<br />
Another popular conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones, in his 2008 documentary 'Endgame: Elite's Blueprint For Global Enslavement' highlights &quot;the message of the mysterious Georgia Guidestones, purportedly built by representatives of a secret society called the Rosicrucian Order, which call for a global religion, world courts, and for population levels to be maintained at around 500 million, over a 5.5 billion reduction from current levels. The stones infer that humans are a cancer upon the earth and should be culled in order to maintain balance with nature.&quot;[10]<br />
<br />
Researcher Van Smith claims to have uncovered numerological messages encoded within the proportions of the various Georgia Guidestones components that link the monument to the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world which opened in Dubai over thirty years after the Georgia Guidestones were designed. Smith presents evidence demonstrating that the opening date of the tower, the death of Dubai's emir, Sheik Maktoum bin Rashid al Maktoum, and the exact height of the Burj Khalifa can all be deduced directly from the proportions of the granite slabs.[11]<br />
<br />
In 2008, the stones were defaced with polyurethane paint and graffiti with slogans such as &quot;Death to the new world order.&quot;[12] Wired magazine called the defacement &quot;the first serious act of vandalism in the Guidestones' history&quot;.[3] More recently, in an apparent attempt to topple the monument, a large notch was cut from the top of the English language Guidestone near the 8&quot; long, 1&#8541;&quot; thick stainless steel dowel pin used to secure that slab to the capstone.[2]<br />
<br />
As of November 14, 2009 (2009 -11-14)[update], the stones bear a variety of graffiti. Elbert County is funding ongoing repair and has installed two video surveillance cameras at the site.[2]<br />

</div> interestingly weird. it must have cost a hell of a lot to build since it's solid granite. (1979, before water or other more exotic cutting methods were used. granite's one tough bitch, so rather expensive to carve.)<br />
so either there's some genuine weirdness out there or someone created a brilliant practical joke that may last millenia!<br />
<br />
hm, if I win the lottery, I will make a granite d20, 50' high inscribed with fertlity symbols, and any odd word I can find from &quot;Tsathoggua&quot; to &quot;Torcer&quot;! :grinyes:</div>

		<hr />
		
			   <b> (July 14) -- Officials in Utah fear that a group of anti-immigration activists may have taken matters into their own hands.</b><br />
<br />
An anonymous group of &quot;concerned citizens&quot; <b>sent a letter this week to newspapers in Utah containing more than 1,300 names of people it says are in the country illegally.</b> It also enclosed a similar letter it had sent to federal and state officials in April. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are enclosing a list of individuals who we strongly believe are in this country illegally and should be immediately deported,&quot; the April 4 letter reads. <br />
<br />
<b>Though the group says it is not violent, the letter includes sensitive information like Social Security numbers, phone numbers and even the due dates of pregnant women on the list, according to reports from multiple Utah news agencies who received the document. KSL Newsradio in Utah reports that nearly every name on the list is of Spanish origin. </b><br />
<br />
Republican Gov. Gary Herbert wants to know how the information was obtained, and he announced on Twitter that he'd directed Utah authorities to see if the list had been leaked illegally by a state employee.<br />
<br />
For its part, the group claims the list is &quot;the result of hard work by a large force of tax-paying citizens over the course of many months who live throughout the state of Utah.&quot; <br />
<br />
The list has not yet been verified, but at least one person on the list has said publicly that he is an illegal immigrant.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a reason why we came here to live, to at least have something better,&quot; Israel Perez told KSL on Tuesday. &quot;But people trying to kick us out, we be like dogs running around and putting us in a cage and sending us back somewhere we don't want.&quot; Perez said his parents brought him to the United States when he was 10 years old.<br />
<br />
In the wake of Arizona's tough new immigration law, the list has sparked fear among immigrants in Utah and raised questions about whether the already heated debate over immigration has taken a vigilante turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;My phone has been ringing nonstop since this morning with people finding out they're on the list,&quot; Tony Yapias, former director of the Utah Office of Hispanic Affairs, told The Associated Press. &quot;They're feeling terrorized. They're very scared.&quot;<br />
<br />
The letter's language -- which seemed to suggest that members of the group had spent time tracking suspected illegal immigrants in their day-to-day lives -- did not help.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our group observes these individuals in our neighborhoods, driving on our streets, working in our stores, attending our schools and entering our public welfare buildings,&quot; the group wrote.<br />
<br />
<b>A promise that the letter's authors would be &quot;listening and watching&quot; to make sure their fellow citizens turn in illegal immigrants didn't sit well with some Utah lawmakers, either.</b><br />
<br />
Democratic state Rep. Neil Hansen called the list makers cowards. &quot;Here's somebody accusing people of being illegals and yet they're not willing to put their name on this,&quot; he told ABC 4 Utah. &quot;It almost seems [like] cowardice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Utah Minutemen Project has denied any involvement in the list, but co-chairman Eli Cawley said he supports the group.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's probably against some privacy laws,&quot; Cawley told KSL. &quot;But I think in the interest of preserving our civilization, preserving our society and protecting the people of the state of Utah, I think that's a greater interest than protecting the privacy of some individuals.&quot;<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Excerpts from &quot;American White Trash&quot;, by Chance Derek Gregory<br />
<br />
What follows is an excerpt from my book, &quot;American White Trash&quot;, which is a chronicle of sorts, of growing up near the end of the world. This particular story isn't the beginning, though -- chronologically -- it takes place near the beginning of my life, when I was 4 or 5 years old, in Westminster, California. I am starting here, with this particular story, because -- well -- you guys know me. In actuality, the book begins more towards the middle, when I was in my early 20's. I have decided to start at the beginning with you guys, because you already know parts of what's coming, so it's not like I am luring you in with &quot;Lean On Me&quot;, before doing a bait n switch for &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot;. In any case, here is an excerpt from the middle of the book.<br />
<br />
I was 5 years old. I tell you this because it matters; 5 year old boys see and do things that are hard to relate to, unless you've been one. I was a fairly normal kid, though a bit more lonely than most. I had a mom and a sister, and we lived in a trailer park in the middle of the city of Westminster. I was the boy from the wrong side of the tracks, even then. The trailer park was on the south side of Hoover Street, across the tracks from school and church. We were poor, but I didn't really understand what that meant at the time. We lived in a doublewide, on a lot at the end of the last street on the north end of the park, down by the trash cans. There was an elementary school on the far side of the north wall, and I went to school there the year before. Something had changed over the summer, and my mom enrolled us in Westminster Christian Academy. I still don't know how she managed. She had two jobs and still qualified for food stamps.<br />
<br />
The year before was my Kindergarten year. We had moved since then, from a single wide, at the bottom of the same street. The old place was still &quot;home&quot; to me, if that makes any sense. I used to slide the aluminium panels under the front porch to the side and squeeze in. I had a fortress there, decorated in blankets and round pillows I had harvested from the dumpsters when I was 4. When we moved, abruptly, over a single weekend, that summer, I left all of that behind. It's probably still there; a spiders nest under a rickety porch.<br />
<br />
I had  left behind more than just my fortress of solitude. My prize possession had been a toy robot I found one day in a large dumpster, standing up, in the front right corner, as if placed there on purpose. I had never seen anything like it before, or since. It stood about a foot and a half tall, had articulated arms and legs, and a hollow, translucent chest cavity. There was a lift below the chest, which held a smaller robot, which rode up and down between the robots legs. This robot was the &quot;driver&quot;, I imagined, and he controlled the larger robot from the chest, rather than the head. I used to keep it under the porch with the rest of my scavenged toys and possessions. That was how I avoided answering too many questions about them. Years later, after the &quot;internet&quot;, I searched for a reference to this toy, but never found one. I'm sure it was made in Japan. It was 1974 in America and almost everything was, even then.<br />
<br />
I was a fairly rough and tumble kid. I wore &quot;toughskins&quot;, bought on sale at Fedco. The knees were double thick, and the seams were double stitched. Most of the time, I had patches on my knees because, like most boys, I tended to wear through there first. My shirts were western style collared shirts, and my hair was cut like a proper boy, parted on one side. I climbed trees whenever I could, because I loved to look at the sky, and I captured Black Widow spiders in tiny Mason jars and kept them hidden from my mom. Mom didn't approve of fort-making, tree-climbing, or spider-keeping. She was against boys, for the most part. I think I reminded her too much of my dad, who had left when I was 4.<br />
I was a latch key kid. I wore a chain around my neck like the ones soldiers use to keep their dog tags handy. I walked my sister home after school, and that was challenging. She was 2 years younger and didn't have a lot of stamina. We usually walked past the Catholic school, at the north end of the park in front of my school. It was about a mile, maybe a little more. We quickly learned to avoid all but one route home. The local Mexican kids didn't appreciate us walking through their territory. After 2 or 3 beatings, I learned to avoid &quot;their&quot; streets.<br />
<br />
My sister and I shared a bedroom and a single set of bunk-beds. I usually slept on the bottom bunk, because I still wet the bed, from time to time. One night, sometime between 3 and 4 in the morning, I woke up to a strange man, standing next to my bed. Even from my point of view, he was tiny. There was space between the top of his head and the edge of the upper bunk. He had small hands and a large head, covered in hair. I couldn't see his mouth, but his whiskers moved a bit when he spoke. &quot;Get up&quot;, he said.<br />
<br />
I tried. I really did. But I was held down, as if by a weight. I began to sweat, and tried to call out for my mom, but I couldn't speak. I looked away from the little man for a fraction of second, and when I turned back to him again, he was gone. I remember fighting against the weight to stand, and trying to put my feet  on the floor, but that's where the memory stops.<br />
<br />
Years later, when I was in my late 20's, my wife and I and our 2 children lived in Conyers, Georgia. One of the couples we had befriended were Cuban, and the woman -- Anna -- was very &quot;spiritual&quot;. She begged me to read her cards top her one evening, and I had had a few drinks, so I decided to entertain her. I had read Tarot cards for a living -- briefly, in my early 20's -- and I knew how to put on a show. Her question had to do with kids, and she asked if she was capable of having another child. I told her no, and that she would adopt instead. Things suddenly became quite tense, and she looked at me as if she was seeing me for the first time. When I asked her what was wrong, she said this:<br />
<br />
&quot;When you were reading my cards,  I saw a little old man, sitting on your shoulder.&quot;<br />
<br />
About a year ago, my wife received a friend request from Anna on Facebook. They had moved to Alabama, and Anna was working for the company that laid me off when we lived in Georgia. She casually remarked to my wife that she and her husband had tried for years to conceive a second child, but in the end -- they had adopted.<br />
<br />
It's a funny world, isn't it?<br />
<br />
(more later)</div>

			The NAACP has approved a resolution condemning what it calls &quot;racist elements&quot; within the Tea Party. The vote has sparked a war of words between the two groups, and NAACP leaders hope the move will help fire up its membership with midterm elections approaching.<br />

<br />
&quot;You must expel the bigots and racists in your ranks or take full responsibility for all of their actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Delegates at the convention unanimously approved a resolution echoing Jealous' words Tuesday night. It said that while the group believed in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in democracy, the Tea Party should repudiate bigoted statements, images and any racist leaders.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't recall the NAACP speaking out when George Bush was portrayed as curious George or as the Joker,&quot; said<br />
<br />
Mark Williams, a national spokesman for the Tea Party Express.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't recall the NAACP ever standing up and saying we need to civilize discourse when Republicans were in the White House,&quot; Williams added.<br />
<br />
A number of tea tarty leaders say they don't tolerate racist displays.<br />
<br />
Williams contends that it's actually the NAACP that's being bigoted.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're dealing with people who are professional race baiters, who make a very good living off this kind of thing. <b>They make more money off of race than any slave trader ever.</b> It's time groups like the NAACP went to the trash heap of history where they belong with all the other vile racist groups that emerged in our history,&quot; Williams said.<br />
<br />
Charges of racism against the Tea Party flared after African-American Congressmen said they were heckled, spat at and were called racial slurs by tea party supporters during a demonstration at the U.S. Capitol.<br />
<br />
People in the tea party movement have been holding rallies for more than a year now calling for limited government and protesting the Obama administration.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been leaving the president hanging,&quot; said Jamal Simmons, a Washington D.C.-based democratic strategist. &quot;The president's been out there pushing these real solid policies: health care, jobs, stimulus, education reform. Those of us who consider ourselves to be his allies, haven't been doing our part in being out there and pushing hard enough against his opponents. Explaining why we're for what the president is doing while they're saying what they're against.&quot;<br />
<br />
Polls show that black Americans still overwhelmingly support the president with approval ratings of about 90 percent. But many in 2008 were considered Obama voters who don't regularly show up to vote. So the resolution is part of a strategy to motivate potential voters to come out and vote in November.<br />
<br />
And so is a upcoming march in Washington that NAACP President Jealous rallied the troops for as the organization gets ready for the mid-term elections.<br />
<br />
&quot;The NAACP along with it allies and partners will show America that a solid majority of this nation is ready, willing and able to fight back to ensure that all the change we voted for is made a reality for all of our children,&quot; Jealous said.<br />
<br />
Madeline Taylor of Memphis, Tenn., said she's glad Jealous decided to take on the Tea Party. She's not perturbed that a Tea Party activist accused the NAACP of being racist.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're always accused of being racist when we stand up and speak for ourselves,&quot; Taylor said.<br />
<br />
The tea party resolution will go to the NAACP's National Board of Directors for a full vote in the fall.

			(July 13) -- Talk about a hangover.<br />
<br />
A man who had too much to drink is recovering today after he attempted to ride a 16-foot saltwater crocodile at a zoo in Australia and was bitten in the leg. <br />
<br />
The 36-year-old man broke into the wildlife park after he was thrown out of a bar. He tried to sit on one of the crocodiles, named Fatso, and give him a pat on the head. Police say Fatso didn't appreciate the gesture and bit him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fatso has taken offense to this and has spun around and bit this man on the right leg,&quot; Sgt. Roger Haynes of Broome said in a press conference.<br />
<br />
The man is lucky to be alive. <br />
<br />
&quot;Saltwater crocodiles ... once they get hold of you, are not renowned for letting you go,&quot; Haynes said, according to The Associated Press.<br />
<br />
The zoo's owner, Malcolm Douglas, said the cool weather may have saved the man's life. &quot;They're cold-blooded animals, so their reflexes slow down,&quot; Douglas told The Australian. &quot;If it had been a hot night, he would have been dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
After sustaining a nasty flesh wound, the man headed back to the bar where he had been kicked out before his reptilian romp. Mark Phillips, the bar's manager, told the BBC that the man returned to the pub that night with pieces of bark sticking out of his leg. He's expected to fully recover.
