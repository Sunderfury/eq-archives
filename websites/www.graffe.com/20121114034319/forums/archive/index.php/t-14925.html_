I don't understand and am pretty annoyed by it.<br />

I didn't notice this happening in Gates of Discord, so maybe it is peculiar to PoP/Plane of Time?<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aauminki</div><div class="date">February 29th, 2004, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't notice any more resists on WF than on SoS myself. We did Time saturday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hester Fizzlecaster</div><div class="date">March 1st, 2004, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's just a sucky RNG for you personally.  It can happen, as we all know the RNG quite often goes in streaks.  Plus, you would pay more attention to any resist you get than any spell you land...take those both together and I think you are maybe mistaken just a tad.  If you wish tho, you can always watch more closely next time and let us know if you see anything different.  My guess is that it's the same as Strike was previously. :) <br />
<br />
However, the resist rate in Discord heh... That leaves little to the imagination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axxius</div><div class="date">March 1st, 2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cleared Time since getting WF. It simply rocked. No difference in resists compared to SoS, but 7k+ crits sure are nice. I think you just got unlucky to be casting it while your druids were slacking on the fire debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zxarien</div><div class="date">March 1st, 2004, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at first i'd be inclined to agree, i got the spell a few days ago and was using it in the 2nd kod'taz trial and i could have sworn i had been resisted nearly 9/10 times. yet when i looked over the logs i think i was resisted outright only once or twice- it was without a druid/sham/magi/nec debuffs as well so it was to be expected there.<br />
i think it is probably as someone else stated, a little bit of the imagination combined with some bad rolls on the RNG<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elauriel</div><div class="date">March 1st, 2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I noticed it two nights in a row, so I have to wonder.  I do know we don't ever get mobs debuffed anymore, because our druids can't be bothered, but I can't figure out why SoS would land much more reliably on the same mobs int he same fights.  I mean it sounds super coincidental to say that White Fire was the spell having problems with the RNG while SoS was not.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I don't have enough data to say anything conclusively, especially because I think we only have one other wizard in guild with the spell, and we don't speak.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if it was just RNG luck, then it was very weird, biased luck, and it sucked.  I will try to acquire some mordata next time we do Time, and see if it happens again or something.</div></div><hr />

Keelhaul them.</div></div><hr />

All other classes are there to make us nuke more efficient. Nothing else matters! Druids better debuff, or we'll hang them by their pointy treehugger ears until the submit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zxarien</div><div class="date">March 2nd, 2004, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">make friends with the treehuggers and the bards! i just join the debuff channel and complain when my sotf click lands since it doesnt stack with either line</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiffe</div><div class="date">March 2nd, 2004, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, do they know that we know when they're slacking?<br />
<br />
&quot;No way!  I debuffed every mob in camp all night!&quot;<br />
&quot;Suuuuure you did.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Istari</div><div class="date">March 4th, 2004, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">post parses of WF vs SOS if you must raise this issue - the vast majority of misconceptions, in fact crippling to wizard knowledge, stem from that people look at their experiences without any measures of precision, drawing conclusions from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telegareth</div><div class="date">March 5th, 2004, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that slacking druids are the primary cause of resists on mobs in Time.  Just tag the mob with flux staff, if it lands, then they need to put hand of ro on it.<br />
<br />
Let them know that you need the debuff, they are probably trying to heal over the clerics instead of debuffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarinthus</div><div class="date">March 10th, 2004, 02:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you could get every wizard in your guild to non-stop spam Staff of Temperate flux on every single mob that comes into camp, and not nuke until it doesn't land. (beware bard debuffs that may fool you into thinking Hand of Ro is on!)<br />
<br />
Eventually, people who have all spell messages on will get annoyed with the 300+ &quot;Target looks uncomfortable&quot; every fight. And when you let your guild know what you're doing, they'll be forced to make the druids Hand of Ro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salamane</div><div class="date">March 10th, 2004, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having the 'Spell Awareness' leader ability is also nice for being able to conclusively see when the Druid's are slacking. A druid in my group tonight was bit stunned when I pointed out to her that I could see precisely when she was casting and what spells she was casting. Later I got some tells from other Druids enquiring about this ability and wondering just what the range of it was, etc. Muwahahaha...  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramzal</div><div class="date">March 20th, 2004, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I first scribed White Fire, I tested it on a fully time geared guild rogue, which i can NEVER get spells to hit hard, first cast hit him for 4k+, and brought him from 100-56%, the next 3 or 4 were resisted, and the last one did another 4k,  seems like in pvp it either gets resisted totally or hits really hard, so far from my testing. Must test more~!  =p</div></div><hr />
