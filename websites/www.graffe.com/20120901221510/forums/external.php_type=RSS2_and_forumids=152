			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Okay, I can't eat cottage cheese, sour cream, yogurt, or anything with an active dairy culture/acidophilus in it and mayonnaise, even the homemade fresh kind, makes me ill. Other than that, the sky's the limit.<br />
<br />
My wife got 50lb. of Yukon Gold potatoes for $5.<br />
<br />
I don't know how long these bad boys are going to last @ 60-65F in fairly dry conditions but I intend to eat as many as I can before they go bad.<br />
<br />
To that end, I'm hoping for a bunch of recipes with a fairly low Glycemic Index because eating 50 pounds of potatoes in just a few months probably isn't going to be good on even my non-diabetic self. (I've heard that pairing them with protein or fat causes the body to process the starch/sugar better, thereby allowing for consumption of higher GI foods without as much impact. Is this true?)<br />
<br />
I already really like German Potato Salad (Bacon, Onions, Potatoes, Vinegar, Oil, and a dash of sugar or heatable sweetener), I like baked potatoes with asstons of malt vinegar on them. I enjoy potatoes in my thai red curry and in just about any stir-fry in general, and mashed potatoes are always tasty, if a bit unhealthy due to the amount of cream and butter/oil  I prefer in them.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, I'm pretty much out of ideas, but especially vinegary recipes are highly welcome as I *really* enjoy vinegar with my potatoes.<br />
<br />
Anyone?</div>

<br />
A couple of days ago, I came across some folks who built their own wheel from some cleverly salvaged parts. I think I could likely scrounge the required bits, and probably hammer something together, but before I dive into that well I thouht it might be prudent to ask: Anyone here done something like this before and have pointers/advice I might want?</div>
