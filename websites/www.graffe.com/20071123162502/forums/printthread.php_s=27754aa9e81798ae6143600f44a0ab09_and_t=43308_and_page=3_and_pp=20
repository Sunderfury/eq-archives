				<div style="font-style:italic">The tiered system is kind of dissapointing on the DD side of things, though looks really nice on the new concussion.  <br />
I'd really like to see some qualititive difference between having the first tier and the third tier--slightly better resist check, more efficient, whatever.  ATM the only difference on any of the dd is they get 4% more damage and cost 4% more mana per tier.<br />
Truthfully, i can see myself having first or second tier of the DD spells and not caring to get the higher ones. What difference does it make besides being able to OOM yourself 8% faster and agro coming in 8% larger chunks, making it slightly harder to control?</div>

Devs on EQLive already responded to the whining about the tiered system, in the most comprehensive way. You don't need Tier 3 unless you are fighting raid level mobs (in which case you will definitely get Tier 3 spells). Tier 2 is designed to be on par with single-group content. Before TSS, you could not get your top spells at all unless you were raiding. Now you get a slightly less powerful form of them for free (Tier 1 is vendor sold), raiding or not. And if you group - you will get Tier 2 too.<br />
<br />
When you think about it and understand that you are getting major spells for free - there should be no complaining.</div>

There is no increase in efficiency, so if mana is a limiting factor, your better off having tier 1 spells for everything your not going to be casting when GoM procs, because you'll get slightly more GoM procs overall.<br />

If agro is a limiting factor, tier 1 spells are better because you get a slightly smoother scaling thats going to be a bit easier to avoid agro with.<br />

ATM, the only time that its worthwhile to have higher than tier 1 spells is if you plan on using it when GoM procs, or if neither mana or agro is a concern.<br />

That thinking would be like saying use Corona Flare over ACF.<br />
<br />
I have to say that sounds completely wrong.  The new spells coupled with new AAs (me being a player who will get most of the new AAs  in a week or three after the exp is released along with most of the T2 spells) should make it worthwile for you to get the max Tier possible.<br />
<br />
The new spells/AAs should make aggro problems a thing of the past.  So the more power for your mana should be obvious.  The average decent augged CoA enable wizzy will prob push about 13k average mana with the new levels.  Of course their will be augs for the 75 focus, nothing special, but something none the less.  Low mana issues should not really be a big deal.  The spells also seem to scale up nicely, with repect to mana vs damage. Not to mention in group situation you get a possible kill shot harvest.  So the bigger the nuke, the better chance to get the killshot perhaps thus giving you a chance for 500 more mana and so on.   Pesonally I feel everyone should get the max level of spell they can for all their spells.<br />
<br />
Thanks Qaman for both the AAs and the Spells.  TSS looks pretty impressive to say least imo.<br />
<br />
One thing did catch my attention about the expansion.  This new resist - Corruption, could you explain more about that or point me to a place that does please?<br />

Edit: Also heard we are getting AA reinbursed for the channelling stuff, this true too?</div>

<br />
Basically it is a whole new resist, working along the lines of Disease/Poison. You only have 15 resist in it to start out with. And gear with it will be pretty scarce for now. Spells that use it are tuned accordingly though. It also doesn't count for prismatic/chromatic checks. No players spells have it for a resist either.<br />

With worn focus 65 and new version of EF + manaweave focus + new crit AAs + Druid epic 2.0 + Ancient call of power we could crit as high as <b>47710.</b><br />

Bards aren't getting a new focus, they get something different that I got to play around with a bit, but not as much as I would have liked. Our flappies are picking up the slack for the bard focus though. And what the new end focus will be remains to be seen, remember even the top ones now will only be ~45% with level 75 spells.</div>

		<div>This looks like the best wizard upgrade in an expansion in awhile.  Still it doesn't bring us up to top level dps.  Currently on parses I am coming out a little above the bards on straight burns.  This might give me the chance to get up to monk level but rog, bsk and rng still leave me in the dust.  Last parse I think I did 44k damage while the top ranger did 145k.  Monks were around 58k.  I could probably squeeze more dps out by nuking harder, faster at the beginning of the fight and just trust the tanks to keep aggro.<br />

I have to say that while we don't get the snare upgrade the rest of the spells and AA look like an improvement over what we have now.</div>

As a raiding wizard, I find some rather large holes in your argument.  Specifically, you don't use all of these spells in a raid (telakisz is a glaring example, and I rarely.. scratch that - NEVER - use claw of vox in a raid setting).  It seems to me at least, the non raiding spells should have their efficiency increased.  And perhaps rather than a damage increase (or better - in ADDITION to a damage increase), the casting times on the 'raid' type spells should be reduced.</div>

The 0.01 fluctuation is probably an oversight and can be fixed. And it won't make any real difference.<br />
<br />
We got some spells that have no use on raids (or no use at all - like the lure rain) as a continuation of the existing PoP/OoW lines. Those are singular aberrations and don't affect the general picture.<br />

If you don't use Claw of Vox on raids today - that is probably because you have Chaos Flame (and please don't say you don't use that spell on raids) and there are no raid mobs that would be more resistant to fire than cold and require extra long time to kill. I currently don't cast ANY non-fire nukes except several casts that are required by design of 2 specific events (Suchun and Devlin). But it only means that raid designers have been lacking imagination. We still need nukes of all 3 types in case they start making events that require them.<br />
<br />
I agree that having spells with shorter casting times and better DPM would be nice, but that's just another dimension that doesn't have to be a part of the tiered spell system. SOE got a good thing started, and it will evolve with time. There is always more to want, but it's impossible to get everything at once.</div>

			<div><strong>Couple questions</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>These questions are to those who participated in the beta:<br />
<br />
1) Why were rarely to never used spells continued?   Did the devs not get this feedback, did they not believe the feedback, or do they believe these have use?<br />
<br />
2) I hear the new resist system got &quot;postponed&quot; at the last second.   Does this last second change help or hurt wizard DPS?     Was the spell design put in place with the new resist system in mind?   Were mob resists tweaked with the new resist system in mind?<br />
<br />
3) I have read Qaman's post on &quot;theoretical&quot; numbers for wizard DPS.    The question is: how do wizard fair relative to other DPS focused classes?    How do they do in encounters lasting less than a min, 1 - 3 min, 3 - 6 mins, and sustained?   I ask this because I read some results on the everquest forums and I am uncertain as to validity but I am concerned if it is even half true.</div>

		<div>There are a lot of spell lines and they get lots of feedback, most of what we kept was pretty decent, and some things are just going to be 'niche' type spells. Not always a bad thing, sometimes there are places where you can really use them. As long as they aren't the majority, I don't think it is a big worry.<br />
<br />
The numbers I posted aren't something anyone would have experienced in beta because they require equipment that wasn't available. You should be able to chain cast pretty much in the 1-6 minute range, after that it starts dropping off a lot.<br />
<br />
Since they were messing with the resist system a lot in beta, and still haven't finished with it, it is really hard to say how it will affect us except theoretically. Basically, it curves more so you should be able to hit things with high resists easier than before, but some things with lower resists will resist a bit more. Since they have been trying to adjust values on older content to keep it about the same and those values are still going live, right now some things may actually be easier to hit than they were before.<br />
<br />
Of course, this will apply to players as well, high resists won't really guarantee immunity anymore. But hard to say exactly how much impact atm.</div>

		<div>In regards to the efficiency of the spells I would say Tier2 should be more efficient.  Figure those are the &quot;Group&quot; spells.  Raiding spells are not about efficiency most of the time.  You are not usually looking for sustained DPS.  I don't know if the Devs looked at it the same way, but the grouping type spells should always be the more efficient spells even if they are not the biggest bang.<br />
<br />
The other question I had is if there was any discussion on Wizards getting a group version of fixed invis or a self invis AA?  Lev would be another that has some usefulness.  Not sure how much people would want that, but I find I am the best chance for invis in a lot of the groups I am in.  Group version even of non fixed would be really nice at times like running from the WoS port in to MPG without training anybody at the zone in.</div>

		<div>Oh btw, the Tier 1 spells are not entirely 'free'... They are actually quite pricey. With 390 CHA it will cost me 16k pp for the entire set of Tier 1 spells from the vendor (Jaelle Florica: -722, 1018 in Goru'kar Mesa). But then again, it's not nearly as bad as PoP scrolls and OoW runes went for.</div>
