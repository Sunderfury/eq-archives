			Nathanial Johnson had grown tired of the burglaries at his mobile home in the small town of Leroy, Ala., about 60 miles north of Mobile.<br />
<br />
So the 68-year-old decided to take matters into his own hands Friday night by springing a trap, Washington County Sheriff Richard Stringer told Fox affiliate WALA-TV.<br />
<br />
In an attempt to make it look like nobody was home, Johnson parked his vehicle at a neighbor’s home and returned to his abode and waited, according to Al.com.<br />
<br />
Sitting near his back door, Johnson told police, he turned the lights off and placed a car mirror near a window so he could see what was happening outside, according to WALA.<br />
<br />
Johnson told authorities that someone knocked on his front door before midnight, Al.com reported. Johnson did not answer and continued to wait as he heard the person move to the back door and break the lock, Al.com reported.<br />
<br />
Johnson told police that he confronted the person, prompting the suspected burglar to fall or jump off the back steps, Al.com reported.<br />
<br />
Johnson subdued the man once he was on the ground and tied his hands behind his back, police told Al.com. The man was later identified as 31-year-old Cleveland Jones Gully.<br />
<br />
Police said that after restraining Gully’s hands, Johnson placed duct tape over his mouth and tied the man to a tree using rudimentary materials — electrical wire, rope from a clothesline and masking tape.<br />
<br />
“He began to tie him to the tree still in the standing-up position,” Stringer told WALA, noting that Johnson used “multiple layers of masking tape that he had wrapped around his mouth and all the way around his head.”<br />
<br />
With the alleged intruder tied to a tree, Johnson told police, he returned to his neighbor’s house to alert police.<br />
<br />
Gully “was still alive at that point, and there was no indication that he was dying,” Stringer told Al.com.<br />
<br />
But when sheriff’s deputies arrived at Johnson’s home 10 minutes later, Stringer said, Gully was dead.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think he was intending to kill the intruder,” Stringer told WALA. “I think he wanted to capture him and have him arrested.”<br />
<br />
Stringer told AL.com that Gully — who lives nearby and had a reputation for breaking into homes — had cuts around his body from the wire used to tie him up but no other visible injuries. Johnson was not armed with a weapon at the time, Stringer said.<br />
<br />
Johnson’s niece, Simone Johnson, told WALA that Gully’s death has left many people in pain.<br />
<br />
“He doesn’t bother anybody,” she said, referring to her uncle. “He’ll help you if you need helping, so the family just hates what happened. I know the other guy. His family is hurting, too, but we are also and we hate that, and I hope that we can just get this resolved soon.”<br />
<br />
The alleged intruder’s uncle, Michael Gully, told WALA that he was shocked by the allegations leveled against his relative.<br />
<br />
“I was surprised that it happened,” he said. “He just wasn’t a violent person that I know of.”<br />
<br />
Stringer told WALA that Johnson is not facing criminal charges while authorities await the results of an autopsy that will determine the cause of Gully’s death.<br />
<br />
Police held him in custody for 72 hours, the station reported.<br />
<br />
“We will probably present it to the grand jury to see what they say about it,” he added.

			Stephen Cebula was wrapped up in the online adventures of “Heroes of the Storm” when he apparently decided to deliver a message to his foes.<br />
<br />
And that’s how the 28-year-old Sacramento gamer found himself facing federal charges Thursday of threatening to visit Blizzard Entertainment’s headquarters with an AK-47, according to a 33-page federal indictment.  <br />
<br />
In one threat, U.S. District Court records show, he wrote: “Careful Blizzard … I live in California and your headquarters is here in California … You keep silencing me in Heroes of the Storm and I may or may not pay you a visit with an AK 47 amongst some other ‘fun’ tools.”<br />
<br />
Cebula, who was arrested July 12, told investigators he sent threats to the Irvine-based company and other players through his Facebook account because he wanted “to scare” them, FBI Special Agent Brady Cowan wrote in a federal criminal complaint.<br />
<br />
Cebula said he looked up the gaming company’s address online and mentioned it in one of his threats “to give them a sinking feeling that they should be worried,” Cowan said.<br />
<br />
Prosecutor say Cebula also wrote: “You keep silencing people in heroes of the storm and someone who may live in California might be inclined to ‘cause a disturbance’ at your headquarters in California with an AK47 and a few other ‘opportunistic tools’ ... It would be a shame to [anger] the wrong person. Do you not agree blizzard?”<br />
<br />
Cebula told federal investigators the term “opportunistic tools” was designed to “let their minds wander” and the reference to using an AK-47 was “because it seemed like the scariest weapon,” Cowan said.<br />
<br />
If convicted, Cebula faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Since its set in Salt Lake City in 1873 and thus Mormons are characters and Church is part of the background etc<br />
Brigham Young is in the story too<br />
and after years of reading on him and more research, I cannot honestly put the man in as a &quot;benign character&quot;<br />
he was bad bastard! Sorry LDS folk, but the evidence is too much to ignore<br />
<br />
put an &quot;author's note&quot; in also dealing with interesting bit of history at a junction in the story when all this comes up:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Author's note: the Emma Mine Scandal really happened! Trying to pawn off a worn out mine as one loaded with silver to British investors caused an enormous furore. Some of the investors were ruined and helped play into a series of events such as the &quot;USA Coinage Act of 1873&quot; that lead to a world wide depression. $1.5 million then is worth about $150 million now, and actually, because of the way economics work, the amount of &quot;power&quot;, the effect that amount of money had was greater back then as there were less millionaires etc. So it nearly did trigger a very severe diplomatic break, even a war with the British Empire.<br />
<br />
While I have no issue with the Mormon faith, the historic facts do not paint Brigham Young well at all. Every religion has it's leaders who veered far from the path, people should be honest and admit such, we're all just Human. I'm not unjustly attacking Brigham's character, a mixed race person like the fictional Marienne would have very good reason to loathe him. Check the history, I'm actually veering towards a less malign take on the man than evidence suggests.<br />
<br />
The history of the Federal government's attacks on the Mormon faith are also clear, also it's lust for land, and all kinds of corruption, dirty tricks etc.<br />
<br />
So people do need to realize that while there were good individuals, the various &quot;sides&quot;, as usual throughout history in any country, culture or religion, were riddled with scumbags, &quot;jobs worthies&quot; and morons who wanted power and often got it, to everyone else's detriment. That's Human Nature
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Marienne is a mixed race female character from New Orleans who's' husband ended up getting killed in Salt Lake City by a non-Mormon in a racist attack (Brigham repeatedly castigated mixed race marriages and even said such people should be killed, so he made miscegenation a real tinderbox issue, hence Marienne would almost certainly loathe Brigham)<br />
<br />
this may break from the narrative, but I want to show some of the history and explain I'm not biased against Brigham portraying him as a racist, misogynist, political &quot;chancer&quot; who became rich because of his bullying and &quot;insider trading&quot; because that's what he WAS<br />
<br />
or should I just leave that author's note out ya think?</div>

			A teacher in Florida is suing the Miami-Dade County School Board for race discrimination after she was turned down for a position in the district’s Extended Foreign Language program because she does not speak a foreign language. ¡Ay! ¡Esta guera es loca!<br />
<br />
Tracy Rosner, a non-Spanish-speaking third grade teacher at Coral Reef Elementary in Palmetto Bay, Florida, requested to fill a language arts position that requires teachers to teach one hour of Spanish a day. According to her lawyers, Rosner felt that another instructor could assume responsibilities over the Spanish-teaching portion of the class, while she would focus on reading and writing. The Miami-Dade County School Board did not agree.<br />
<br />
After being passed over for the job, Rosner—who is white—filed a federal employment discrimination lawsuit against the board, with her lawyers claiming that she was turned down “because of her race and national origin as a Non-Hispanic individual who was not a fluent and native Spanish-speaker.” <br />
<br />
The Guardian reports:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			The lawsuit claims that because non-Spanish speakers are in the minority population of Miami-Dade County – where census data shows that about two-thirds of the area’s population are Latino or Hispanic – denying Rosner because she does not speak Spanish amounts to “employment discrimination on the basis of race and national origin.”
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Her lawyers told The Miami New Times in a statement that, “The EFL program has a one-hour Spanish component per day that can be taught by any teacher in the program, and not exclusively the English Reading and Comprehension teacher.” <br />
<br />
I can’t wait to sue the next job that requires proficiency in Excel when I do not—and WILL NOT—gain proficiency in Excel.
