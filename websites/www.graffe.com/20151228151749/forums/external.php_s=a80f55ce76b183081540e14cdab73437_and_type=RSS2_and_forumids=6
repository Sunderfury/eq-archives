		<hr />
		
			During 38 years as a Chicago firefighter, George Beary regularly heard the blare from the emergency sirens as he rode on the back of the firetruck.<br />
<br />
Since his retirement in 2005, Beary, the chairman of a committee of retired Chicago firefighters, said he suffers from tinnitus, a condition that causes ringing or buzzing in the ears.<br />
<br />
“There’s a constant ringing in the background,” said Beary, 72. “There’s not really anything you can do for it. It’s a real annoyance. I just try to have the TV higher than the ringing.”<br />
<br />
Beary, former vice president of Chicago Firefighters Union Local 2, is among about 4,400 current and former firefighters nationwide who are suing Federal Signal, an Oak Brook-based company that makes sirens, claiming it didn't do enough to make them safer for those on firetrucks. Since 1999, Beary said he and about 700 Chicago firefighters have filed suit. Some have been settled or ruled on, but the vast majority, about 500, are still open, Beary said.<br />
 <br />
Firefighters contend the company could have designed sirens in a way that directs the volume away from areas where firefighters sit in the engines, shielding them from sound blasts that lawyers say reach 120 decibels, roughly equivalent to a rock concert.<br />
<br />
Federal Signal argues that directing the sound defeats one of the main purposes of a siren — to warn motorists and pedestrians that a truck is coming. And it says it has long supported what many departments have advised their firefighters to do: wear ear protection.<br />
<br />
David Duffy, attorney for Federal Signal, said studies measuring the level of noise firefighters are exposed to during their work shifts, including sirens, is on average below 85 decibels.<br />
<br />
The lawsuits, which began surfacing more than a decade ago, have been in places such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, New Jersey and the Chicago area, said attorney Marc Bern, who's leading all of them. In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said juries have decided in favor of Federal Signal in most of the half-dozen or so suits that have gone to trial.<br />
<br />
The company also has settled in some cases without admitting any wrongdoing. The largest settlement, reached in 2011, required the company to pay $3.6 million to 1,069 firefighters for cases filed in Philadelphia.<br />
<br />
Bern said Federal Signal could have made the sirens with a shroud to warn those in its path instead of a more generalized blare.<br />
<br />
“Clearly, you don't have to have sound going all the way to the rear of the fire engine,” he said. “If you're driving behind a fire engine and you don't see a 50-foot-long, red ... engine with lights going on and off, there's really something wrong.”<br />
<br />
Chicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford said most, if not all, of the department’s firetrucks, are now equipped with an electronic siren with more directional output and less return to the vehicle’s cab compared with the older, mechanical models.<br />
<br />
Federal standards take into account the intensity of the sound and the duration. The higher the decibel level, the shorter the time workers can be exposed to it.<br />
<br />
Rick Neitzel, who studies noise and other exposures at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said the standards are geared to traditional jobs like manufacturing, not firefighting, where shifts can last longer and the exposure is intermittent but intense.<br />
<br />
“A lot of the questions now are: Is the current recommended level appropriate for exposure that a firefighter would have? And I would say we're not entirely sure,” he said.<br />
<br />
Dr. Lawrence Lustig, a hearing loss expert at Columbia University Medical Center, said people have different levels of susceptibility. Some research involving animals seems to imply that noise exposure in early years leads to more rapid age-related hearing loss, he said.<br />
<br />
Beary said he considers himself “lucky” compared with some of his fellow firefighters. At several retiree functions, he said he noticed others also had ailments after they were exposed to the prolonged whine of a fire rig’s siren.<br />
<br />
“I noticed the TVs in the firehouses were a lot louder than I was used to, because they couldn’t hear,” Beary said. “We knew they had some hearing loss, but they didn’t know what to attribute it to. I’d practically have to scream at them for many of them to hear me.”

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Anyone have any recommendations on dealing with a queasy stomach? My usual gotos are not working anymore. I've been more sick than I have been in my life this past week for no discernible reason and the only part of it has been an upset stomach despite not having done anything out of the ordinary. I went to the doctor after day three of throwing up every hour and he came up with nothing as far as a stomach virus or the sort. I still feel like shit though and can't get anything done as a result. I thought maybe someone at a meeting had some bug I caught but they feel fine. It is weird as hell because about an hour after that I started puking my guts out worse than I ever had since I had the flu in my teens. I can't keep a goddamn thing down. I don't have a fever or anything is the weird part.</div>

			A millionaire businessman has been found not guilty of rape after claiming he accidentally penetrated her when he tripped and fell.<br />
<br />
Ehsan Abdulaziz, 46, was initially accused of forcing himself on the 18-year-old as she slept on a couch at his London flat after a night of drinking.<br />
<br />
The Saudi property developer said he had already had sex with the young woman’s 24-year-old friend and it was possible his penis may have been poking out of his underwear when he tripped.<br />
<br />
The Mirror reported the group had met at an exclusive West End club last year where he entertained them before offering them a lift home.<br />
<br />
The 18-year-old claimed that after a number of drinks at Abdulaziz’s north London home, she went to sleep on the couch.<br />
<br />
She said she woke up to find him on top of her, forcing himself on her.<br />
<br />
“She woke up with the defendant kissing her and his penis in her vagina,” prosecutor Jonathan Davies told the Southwark Crown Court.<br />
<br />
“She said: ‘What are you doing?’ and he said ‘It’s fine’, indicating that her friend was asleep.<br />
<br />
“She got up to find her friend, tried to wake her but couldn’t, she then tried to get out of the flat as quickly as she could.”<br />
<br />
Abdulaziz said he had accidentally fallen on the teenager and that she tried to seduce him, and that was how his DNA got onto her vagina.<br />
<br />
“I’m fragile, I fell down but nothing ever happened, between me and this girl nothing ever happened,” he said.<br />
<br />
He also told the court it was possible he had semen on his hands after having sex with the young woman’s friend.<br />
<br />
<b>The jury acquitted Abdulaziz after just 30 minutes of deliberations. </b>

			FORT WORTH &#8212; A warrant has been issued for Ethan Couch, the &quot;affluenza&quot; teen who received probation for killing four people in a drunk driving crash two years ago.<br />
<br />
Multiple independent sources tell News 8 that Couch missed a check-in with his probation officer earlier this month. Sources say that court officers couldn't find Couch or his mother. His father reportedly said he didn't know where they were.<br />
<br />
Couch is serving 10 years of probation in the juvenile system, so records are protected. He received the sentence after lawyers contended he lived life as a rich kid whose parents gave him no boundaries or consequences. It was a case of &quot;affluenza,&quot; said a defense psychologist.<br />
<br />
District Judge Jean Boyd determined he would be better served in treatment programs outside the juvenile justice system. Couch spent time in treatment at the Vernon State hospital in West Texas and was released several months ago.<br />
<br />
Recently a cellphone video surfaced that appears to show Couch at a beer pong game with friends in October. The Tarrant County District Attorney's Office assigned investigators to look into the video.<br />
<br />
Prosecutors had already filed a motion to transfer Couch to adult court to finish his probation. <br />
<br />
A hearing on that motion has not yet been held. He turns 19 in April.<br />
<br />
Scott Brown and Wm. Reagan Wynn, Couch's lawyers, released a statement:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">

		<hr />
		
			We have recently learned that, for the last several days, the juvenile probation officer has been unable to make contact with Ethan or his mother with whom he has been residing. It is our understanding that the Court has issued a directive to apprehend to have Ethan detained because he is out of contact with his probation officer. We do not have any further information concerning this situation. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for us to publicly discuss this matter further at this time.

</div>It seems that affluenza rehab worked out well.  :rolleyes:</div>

<br />
Really. This is where the whole shared Universe thing officially went off the rails. All I can say is, if they can pull this off and have it make any sense whatsoever then they will have created the greatest feat in cinematic history. Hollywood people are just like politicians in a lot of ways. They get so wrapped up in their own little bubbles that they lose all perspective on reality and what would actually work on a large scale. While the GI Joe movies didn't do terrible, it's not like they were tearing up box office records either.<br />
<br />
Paramount would be better served by selling the rights for Star Trek to Disney so they can put them into the Star Wars universe.<br />

			The Texas plumber who is suing AutoNation for $1 million says his family received death threats after a pickup truck he traded in with the car dealer ultimately ended up in the hands of ISIS fighters in Syria. <br />
<br />
Mark Oberholtzer says he traded in his black, Ford F-250 pickup truck at AutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway in Houston and was told the dealership would remove the decals of his company logo from the truck on their own to avoid scratching the truck’s paint. <br />
<br />
<b>Months later, Oberholtzer says the truck began showing up in photographs posted on extremist Twitter feeds, with the logo and phone number of his Mark-1 Plumbing company still clearly visible. </b><br />
<br />
“My secretary called me and said, ‘You can’t believe this,’” Oberholtzer told ABC News. “I really at first thought it was just somebody playing with us.” <br />
<br />
“She was getting constant calls, threats, nothing about plumbing,” the Texas City, Texas, plumber said of his secretary. <br />
<br />
<b>The social media photos, which also began to pop up on Yelp, show the truck in action with ISIS militants firing an anti-aircraft gun with the Mark-1 Plumbing logo and company phone number clearly visible. </b><br />
<br />
Photos of the truck even made it into the final episode of “The Colbert Report” on Comedy Central. <br />
<br />
“A Texas plumber’s work truck showed up in Syria, although, pickup truck, desert, giant machine gun, that could still be Texas,” Colbert joked on the show. <br />
<br />
Using the website Carfax.com, the truck was tracked from an auction site in Houston to Mersin, Turkey and, finally, somewhere near Aleppo in Syria and in the hands of jihadists. <br />
<br />
Oberholtzer’s lawsuit against AutoNation, filed this month in Texas, seeks $1 million in damages, claiming “Mark-1’s revenues were lost and the company’s reputation … was irretrievably damaged.” <br />
<br />
“I don’t need this press and I don’t need the threats to my family,” said Oberholtzer, who was also questioned by FBI and Homeland Security officials after photos of his truck emerged online. <br />
<br />
AutoNation told ABC News the company set Oberholtzer’s truck out for auction as soon as it came in. <br />
<br />
“The truck came in on trade and was immediately sent to auction. The auctions in most accounts will prep the vehicles. We have the paperwork that shows the steps the vehicle took,&quot; AutoNation said in a statement. &quot;It is unfortunate that the customer has had to go through this.” <br />

I would like to know how to reach the universe in which these school administrators live, because I want to hang out in a realm of existence where Star Wars stuff apparently is real.</description>
