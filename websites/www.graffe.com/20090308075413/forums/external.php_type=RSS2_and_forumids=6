			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><i>Main point of this postessay: to share some reflections on American and Asian culture gained through a mundane experience.</i><br />
<br />
I had an interesting cross-cultural experience recently. I needed to explain a behavioral issue involving invoking the term &quot;conformity&quot; (super-idiotic things Chinese companies do, IS THIS CONTINENT A KINDERGARTEN??), when I realized I wasn't sure I knew the proper word. I decided to ask around among some really smart guys - 3 different Chinese grads of Princeton, Cornell, and Columbia, which word is proper in English. None of them knew. I could get them on board with the English, but nobody had a clue about the Chinese. I revoked their Ivy League diplomas on the spot. <br />
<br />
<i>Strange</i>. Asian culture is ruled by conformity. <br />
<br />
I took to the internet. After fishing around internet encyclopedias and academic journal database subscriptions, I found a few possibilities (&#36981;&#20174;&#65292;&#39034;&#20174;&#65292;&#22857;&#20174;&#65289; The Wikipedia/Baidu article on &quot;Authoritarianism&quot; cites conformism as an important element of dictatorships, apparently translated from English. Baidu has an article on &quot;The Theory of Social Confirmism&quot; - a communist primer on the free media's ability to inculcate people with the values of the bourgeoisie, partially mis-attributed to Paul Lazarsfeld.<br />
<br />
It struck me. Here I am in the society where conformity is not just something people do, it's the Second Commandment of China, just after &quot;Thou shalt honor thy mother and father.&quot;  It's like someone clipping a rosebush every day but never saying anything about &quot;rosebush&quot;, to the point of forgetting what the thing's called.<br />
<br />
That, I think, is one of the great things about America compared to Asia. Even as the corpses were piling up, nobody in China ever thought of questioning the idiotic shit they were conforming to. Peculiarly, histories of 19th-20th century China repeatedly use a contraction for &quot;conformist citizens&quot;  (&#39034;&#27665;) - conforming to the values of whoever has power; Confucians, Nationalists, Communists, and now Westernism. &quot;Conformist citizen&quot; is the usual explanation for massacre and mass starvation. All it takes is for one moron (Mao Zedong) to force his opinions on a nation of conformist sheep to have people burying all their rice in 20-foot deep &quot;growth wells&quot; and go on the wild, random rampages of the cultural revolution.<br />
<br />
That's where America and Europe(to a lesser extent) differ. It's individualistic. If the many are stupid bleating sheep, we voice an opinion. We disagree. We find a better way. America is the most individualistic and anti-conformist country in the world. Certainly, some people will try to gain authority or power over others by invoking social conformity. In China, this would work; it's good as mind control. In America, not so much. We understand &quot;conformism&quot; and can resist inappropriate forms of social control. While anyone with an objective willingly conforms to certain norms, we are also free do the right thing when necessary; we never became a fascist country, and good men opposed slavery and jim crow from the outset.</div>

Honeymoon In Hell<br />
Amid all the gloom, Obama gets high marks in the latest NEWSWEEK poll, with the GOP in the doghouse.<br />
<br />
Despite the tumbling economy, Barack Obama continues to enjoy a honeymoon with the American public in the face of the most trying crisis any newly inaugurated president has encountered since Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The GOP, meanwhile, is viewed by a majority of Americans as the party of &quot;no,&quot; without a plan of its own to fix the economy, and even rank-and-file Republicans are concerned about the party's direction, according to the first NEWSWEEK Poll taken since Obama assumed office.<br />
<br />
&quot;People give Obama credit for reaching out to Republicans, but they don't see Republicans reciprocating,&quot; says pollster Larry Hugick, whose firm conducted the survey. &quot;A surprising number said bipartisanship is more important than getting things done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall, 58 percent of Americans surveyed approve of the job Obama is doing, while 26 percent disapprove and one in six (16 percent) has no opinion. Although his approval ratings are down from levels seen a few weeks ago in other polls, 72 percent of Americans still say they have a favorable opinion of Obama—a higher rating than he received in NEWSWEEK Polls during the presidential campaign last year. The president's rating in this poll is consistent with estimates provided by other national media polls in the last week.<br />
<br />
On the most important issue of the day, the NEWSWEEK Poll shows that close to two thirds (65 percent) of the public say they are very or somewhat confident that Obama will be successful in turning the economy around. That's down just a little from the 71 percent who felt that way before he took office. Still, overall perceptions of the economy remain solidly negative, with 84 percent saying the national economy is in poor shape and just 3 percent viewing things positively.<br />
<br />
The public is also dubious about some of the president's programs. Majorities of Americans think too much has been spent so far to help rescue large banks in danger of failing and domestic auto companies facing bankruptcy. A somewhat surprising majority (56 percent) supports nationalizing large banks at risk of failing—a policy the Obama administration has shied away from. And fewer than half of those polled (49 percent) say they support Obama's proposal to allow the expiration of tax cuts for those with incomes above $250,000 at the end of next year. (Forty-two percent say they oppose ending these cuts.)<br />
<br />
Even so, faith in Obama personally has apparently carried over into optimism about the future. More than a third (37 percent) of the public expect economic conditions to improve in the next 12 months, compared with 29 percent who think things will be worse. Another big plus for the president's policies is that a huge majority of Americans (73 percent) favor his plan to remove most U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of next year.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem for the GOP, according to the poll, may be that 58 percent of Americans believe that Republicans who have opposed Obama's economic-rescue plans have no plan of their own for turning the economy around. With the Republicans having lost the White House and both houses of Congress, public identification with the party has dropped to a recent low point of 26 percent, after running at or near 30 percent for most of the last 15 years. That's the lowest level since the Watergate era and a striking loss of stature for the party, considering that self-described conservatives continue to outnumber liberals in the country by nearly two to one (39 percent vs. 20 percent).<br />
<br />
Many Republicans express concern about where their party is headed and whether GOP leaders in Congress are in touch with their constituents. Asked about the direction of their party, 45 percent of rank-and-file Republicans say it is moving in the right direction, while more than a third (35 percent) think it is going in the wrong direction. This is in sharp contrast to what a NEWSWEEK Poll found in 1999 after the Clinton impeachment hearings. At that time, 65 percent of Republicans said their party was headed in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Some of these results spring from discontent over Republican leadership; other survey respondents indicate the party is ideologically lost. More than half of Republicans today (52 percent) say they don't think GOP congressional leaders are in touch with what the average Republican thinks. While four in 10 Republicans (39 percent) think the GOP is about right in terms of ideology, another 38 percent believe it is not conservative enough, and only 20 percent think it is too conservative.<br />
<br />
Apart from Obama himself, however, the Democratic Party can hardly crow about these results. The public's general disdain for Congress—including the Democratic leadership—hasn't changed much since the Democrats took over in 2006. More people have an unfavorable opinion of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi than a favorable one (41 percent vs. 35 percent). Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid fares little better, with 28 percent viewing him unfavorably and 23 percent with a favorable opinion. One reason for Pelosi's and Reid's low numbers is that by a large margin—51 percent to 40 percent—Americans say they value bipartisanship in Washington over getting things done quickly. And the public doesn't see Democratic congressional leaders acting in a bipartisan manner nearly as much as Obama, who is given credit for trying: 71 percent feel that the president has made a reasonable effort to work with and listen to Republicans on Capitol Hill.<br />
<br />
The results are based on telephone interviews conducted March 4-5 with a nationally representative sample of 1,203 adults, age 18 and over. The overall margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.<br />

				Story Highlights<ul><li>Vince Weiguang Li will be hospitalized at a psychiatric facility</li>
<li>Ruling angers relatives of the victim, Tim McLean Jr., 22</li>
<li>&quot;This was justice,&quot; prosecutor tells Canadian television station</li>
</ul><br />
<b>(CNN) -- A man charged in the beheading death of his seatmate on a Greyhound Canada bus last summer is not criminally responsible because he is mentally ill, a judge ruled Thursday, said CNN affiliate CBC News.</b><br />
<br />
The ruling means that Vince Weiguang Li will be hospitalized at a psychiatric facility until he undergoes a review by Manitoba's Criminal Code Review Board in 90 days, CBC said.<br />
<br />
&quot;The goal of criminal law is to punish criminals, not persons who have a severe mental illness,&quot; Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench Judge John Scurfield wrote in the ruling, CBC reported.<br />
<br />
However, the ruling angered relatives of Tim McLean Jr., 22, who died on the bus July 30.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bottom line is, he is getting away with murder,&quot; Vana Smart, McLean's sister, told CBC. Watch how the verdict angers the victim's family »<br />
<br />
Prosecutors told reporters Thursday they had no choice but to ask the judge to find Li not criminally responsible.<br />
<br />
&quot;This was justice because the correct conclusion was reached,&quot; prosecutor Joyce Dalmyn said, according to CBC. &quot;Mr. Li is a schizophrenic. Mr. Li had a severe mental disease. Mr. Li, in my opinion and in the opinion of the psychiatrists, had no idea what he was doing was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
Li, 40, was charged with second-degree murder in McLean's death. A witness on the bus, which was headed from Edmonton, Alberta, to Winnipeg, Manitoba, said a passenger repeatedly stabbed and then decapitated McLean as horrified passengers watched. Just before his death, the victim had been sleeping with his head leaning against the window.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a blood-curdling scream. I was just reading my book and all of a sudden I heard it,&quot; Garnet Caton, who was sitting in front of the two men, told Canadian TV at the time. She said the knife-wielding man shouted at the other passengers to get off the bus, and they did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me and a trucker that stopped and the Greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that,&quot; Caton said. &quot;And when we all got up (to the door), we saw that the guy was cutting off the guy's head.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thirty-four passengers were on the bus. Police said at the time it was unclear what prompted the attack. Witnesses said Li's weapon was a large butcher knife.<br />
<br />
Li was arrested after an hours-long standoff, during which he remained in the bus with McLean's body. Police said he was seized after he broke a window and attempted to jump from the bus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Li is also a victim here,&quot; said Ruth Ann Craig of the Canadian Mental Health Association, according to CBC. &quot;What's going to happen to Mr. Li is not a cakewalk.&quot;<br />
<br />
He will be housed in a locked psychiatric ward, Craig said, while he undergoes assessment and treatment to determine whether he is a risk to himself or society.<br />
<br />
But Tim McLean's mother, Carol deDelley, said she will fight to change the law regarding these types of crimes. &quot;I'm going to do everything I can to make a change here,&quot; she said, CBC reported.<br />
<br />
McLean's father said he is also disappointed with the ruling.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've all lost a family member,&quot; he told CBC. &quot;This isn't the right result.&quot;

My aunt developed type1 aged 10, back then, it was about a death sentence, but the nascient NHS resulted in her getting insulin. 
Her grandson similarly developed it aged about 3, he damn near died, stupid doc just thought he had a flu-like bug and he was in a coma 3 hours later.

				A common virus may be the trigger for the development of many cases of diabetes, particularly in children, UK researchers have reported. <br />
<br />
Signs of enteroviruses were found in pancreatic tissue from 60% of children with type 1 diabetes, but in hardly any children without the disease. <br />
<br />
They also found that 40% of adults with type 2 diabetes had signs of the infection in insulin-producing cells. <br />
<br />
The study published in Diabetologia raises the possibility of a vaccine. <br />
<br />
Although genetics is known to play a fairly substantial role in a person's risk of developing diabetes, environmental factors must also be involved and the idea of a viral cause of diabetes has been considered for decades. <br />
<br />
  The next steps to identify the viruses and find out what they are doing to the infected beta cells will be hugely exciting and will take us a step closer to preventing type 1 diabetes <br />
<br />
Dr Iain Frame, Diabetes UK <br />
<br />
The latest study was made possible by a pathologist in Glasgow who for 25 years collected tissue samples from children across the UK who had died less than 12 months after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. <br />
<br />
Dr Alan Foulis believed that enteroviruses - a common family of viruses which cause symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea - would be present but until recently the technology was not sensitive enough to detect them. <br />
<br />
Along with colleagues from the south west-based Peninsula Medical School and the University of Brighton, he has now been able to look for evidence of the enteroviruses in tissue samples routinely taken during autopsy in 72 children and compare that with samples from 50 children without the condition. <br />
<br />
In those with diabetes who had signs of the virus, it was specifically found in the insulin-producing beta cells. <br />
<br />
Immune trigger <br />
<br />
The researchers suggest that, in children with a genetic predisposition to type 1 diabetes - an autoimmune disease in which beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed - enterovirus infection can trigger the immune reaction that kicks off the disease process. <br />
<br />
With type 2 diabetes - the type often linked to obesity in adults - the researchers speculate that the infection affects the ability of the cells to make insulin, which in combination with the greater demand for insulin in obese people, is enough to set off the disease. <br />
<br />
At the same time, a separate study, published in Science, by researchers at Cambridge University, found four rare mutations in a gene which reduce the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. <br />
<br />
It also backs the viral theory because the gene in question is involved in the immune response to infection with enteroviruses. <br />
<br />
  Type 1 diabetes is a life- threatening condition that requires a life-time of painful finger prick blood testing and insulin injections <br />
<br />
Karen Addington, JDRF <br />
<br />
There are 100 different strains of enterovirus, so although the results open the way for the development of a vaccine, researchers still have to pin down which types are involved. <br />
<br />
The study's author, Professor Noel Morgan from the Peninsula Medical School, said the results showed the underlying infection with enteroviruses was not a &quot;rare event&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;The next stages of research - to identify which enteroviruses are involved, how the beta-cells are changed by infection and the ultimate goal to develop an effective vaccine - will lead to findings which we hope will drastically reduce the number of people around the world who develop type 1 diabetes, and potentially type 2 diabetes as well,&quot; he added. <br />
<br />
Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Diabetes UK, said the study was &quot;a big step forward&quot; in understanding the potential triggers for the disease. <br />
<br />
&quot;We've known for some time that type 1 diabetes cannot be explained by genetics alone and that other, environmental triggers may also play a part. <br />
<br />
&quot;The next steps to identify the viruses and find out what they are doing to the infected beta cells will be hugely exciting and will take us a step closer to preventing Type 1 diabetes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Karen Addington, chief executive of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, who funded the research, said the findings were important as the incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing every year and there is currently no way to prevent it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Type 1 diabetes is a life- threatening condition that requires a life-time of painful finger prick blood testing and insulin injections,&quot; she pointed out.

<br />
By UK law this is highly illegal. You can request the police to do a background check on criminality as an employer, iirc, but not this crap.<br />
The UK government for decades told unions who had storng suspsicions such existed to prove it it existed and refused calls to add more legisilation or investigatiosn about this issue<br />
the Guardian newspaper began an investigation into it last year.<br />
<br />
Any bets such exist in the USA, too? ;)<br />

				Company sold workers' secret data  <br />
 <br />
The data allegedly included personal relationships and employment history <br />
The information watchdog has shut down a company which it says sold workers' confidential data, including union activities, to building firms. <br />
<br />
A raid on The Consulting Association in Droitwich, Worcs, revealed a serious breach of the Data Protection Act, the Information Commissioner's Office said. <br />
<br />
The ICO said a secret system was run for over 15 years enabling employers to unlawfully vet job applicants. <br />
<br />
Action is being considered against more than 40 firms who used the service. <br />
<br />
Past and present customers included Taylor Woodrow, Laing O'Rourke and Balfour Beatty, the ICO added. <br />
<br />
The Consulting Association's owner would also be prosecuted, it said. <br />
<br />
&quot;He should have been notified, registered with our office and he wasn't and that's a criminal offence and that's a clear prosecution,&quot; said deputy information commissioner David Smith. <br />
<br />
  The information commissioner will need to look into this further to see whether these practices are more widespread and take the appropriate action <br />
<br />
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson <br />
&quot;The construction companies that were his customers, we have to investigate and find out just what their involvement is. <br />
<br />
&quot;But what we're looking to do there is issue enforcement proceedings against those that were involved and that'll put them essentially on notice that if they get involved in this illegal trade again, then they will face prosecution.&quot; <br />
<br />
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said he was &quot;sorry the practices have taken place&quot; and welcomed the intervention of the information commissioner. <br />
<br />
&quot;He will need to look into this further to see whether these practices are more widespread and take the appropriate action, as he's already done in this case,&quot; the minister added. <br />
<br />
'Trouble stirrer' <br />
<br />
Not only was the database held without the workers' consent, but the existence of it was repeatedly denied. <br />
<br />
Following the raid on 23 February, investigators discovered that The Consulting Association's database contained the details of some 3,213 workers, the ICO said. <br />
<br />
Data included information concerning personal relationships, trade union activity and employment history, it added. <br />
<br />
Comments included &quot;lazy and a trouble stirrer&quot;, &quot;Ex shop steward. Definite problems. No Go&quot; and &quot;Communist Party&quot;. <br />
<br />
  Trading people's personal details in this way is unlawful and we are determined to stamp out this type of activity <br />
<br />
David Smith<br />
Deputy Information Commissioner <br />
Employers paid £3,000 as an annual fee, and £2.20 for individual details, the ICO said. <br />
<br />
Invoices to construction firms for up to £7,500 were also seized during the raid. <br />
<br />
The ICO said it had served an Enforcement Notice ordering The Consulting Association's owner to stop using the system, and expected the company to cease trading by the end of the week. <br />
<br />
It added that the owner had failed to notify the ICO as a data controller. <br />
<br />
Mr Smith said: &quot;Trading people's personal details in this way is unlawful and we are determined to stamp out this type of activity.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alan Ritchie, general secretary of building workers union Ucatt, said: &quot;Take one of the issues that we have in the construction industry: we have just under two people killed every week through bad health and safety practices and if a whistleblower then raises these issues, then obviously he has found his name on this list. <br />
<br />
&quot;He has never had the chance to challenge it. <br />
<br />
&quot;He has never been able to turn around and say, 'You are classing me as lazy. How can that be?'&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Make of this what you will.<br />
<br />
<b>All pension plans are done.</b>  Make peace with it.  That includes public and private plans.  If you plan on getting a pension, unplan it.  If you are getting a pension, plan on it stopping.<br />
<br />
It does not take an actuary to tell you pensions require a return on their investments to keep paying benefits.  Remember that if you lose 50% of your portfolio today, you must make a 100% return to undo that.  A 25% loss means a 34% return.  The actuarial present values of pensions are shit.  Absolute shit.<br />
<br />
<b>Annuities are done.</b>  And enough of them are insured to drive state insurance agencies into bankruptcy.<br />
<br />
<b>Insurance companies are done.</b>  For the same reasons as pension plans really.<br />
<br />
<b>FDIC will require funding, and a lot of it.  It will take precedence over Social security and Medicare.</b>  The Treasury will need to issue new bonds and other debt instruments.<br />
<br />
<b>Tax revenue will drop below $1 trillion.</b> - Unemployed people don't pay taxes.  The Federal government will need to cut its spending by 50% or more.  There's no way the $60 trillion in liabilities (probably much higher now after the markets took a dive in October) for SS and Medicare can ever be collected.  Make peace with that.  That means those systems are kaput.<br />
<br />
<b>401k and IRAs will be locked up or seized.</b>  I'm sure there will be some nice excuse to do it, but it is still wrong.  If you have any money in those accounts left, take the tax hit and TAKE IT OUT NOW.<br />
<br />
<b>S&amp;P500 will go below 400, DJIX will go below 4,000</b> - once again, as the credit market completely locks up*, any companies with debt will be presumed to have defaulted.<br />
<br />
<b>Unemployment (U-6) will reach 30%</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prepare.  You may now call me crazy and arrogant.  *shrug* Do your own research.  I suggest you put as much money into bullion (and coins), minimize how much you keep in Federal Reserve notes, get your 401k and IRAs out, and do some survival planning.  Maybe I'm paranoid.  Maybe I'm being ridiculous.  I'm in Canada and I am extremely concerned.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to prognosticate over the collapse of the US dollar because quite frankly it is rather complicated.  I just know that sooner or later it won't be able to keep afloat anymore.<br />
<br />
Obama's African-style economics (Zimbabwe style), and Bush before him, will do nothing by make some executives richer and encourage the collapse of the economy.<br />
<br />
<br />
*It now costs $2.25 million in the first year to insure $10 million of debt of GE Capital.  If you assume no recovery, that is a 1 in 5 probability of GE Capital going under; if you assume an 80% recovery that is a greater than 100% probability of GE Capital going under.</div>

<br />
WASHINGTON &#8212; CIA Director Leon Panetta says agency employees who took part in harsh interrogations of terrorism suspects are not in danger of being punished. <br />
<br />
Panetta delivered that message to CIA employees in an e-mail today, reiterating what he told Congress last month. He said then that he would oppose prosecutions of any CIA employee who adhered to their legal guidance on interrogations. <br />
<br />
He sent the message after the Senate Intelligence Committee announced its review of the CIA's interrogation and detention program under President George W. Bush. <br />
<br />
The committee will look at how the CIA decided whom to interrogate, whether it told Congress the truth about the program and whether it was legal. It will also try to determine whether the harsher methods the CIA used elicited valuable intelligence.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid.  I wasnt one of those kids who was bored in class and just slapped with the label.  I truly have ADHD issues.  I never took medicine for it because my stepdad was of the Tom Cruise mindset that medicine cant fix your brain.  I learned to deal with not being able to focus on one task for any length of time by doing multiple tasks at once a little at a time.  In school I would do homework by doing a few math problems, reading a page or 2 out of other textbooks, and just basically rotating through my homework.  I always got Cs and Ds and this is not an optional way to study but it was like torture trying to read through a whole chapter of anything or sit in one place long enough to do so.  When I joined the military you arent allowed ADHD medicine so I never brought it up there. <br />
<br />
To describe how it feels..its like my mind is running a 100mph and I have to be in constant motion.  I weave back and forth when I stand or sit, or tap my feet or drum on my legs.  My wife says my feet even tap when Im asleep.  Its almost unbearable to have a conversation with anyone longer than 15 minutes.  Distraction is my life.  Until today it seems.<br />
<br />
Last week I had a trig test and utterly bombed it.  I sat down and started to recall my special triangles.  At the same time I saw on my test that there was a triangle with a side of 4m.  I thought to myself that 4^2 is 16.  16 is the jersey number of Brett hull who played for my favorite hockey team.  Hull scored 82 goals in one season.  The only person to score more is Gretzky with 92.   In 92 I was living in Columbia, IL.  Thats how my mind goes sometimes.  Now I had all these numbers in my head and I was second guessing what the special triangles were now.  Is the triangle A1 B1 CSquare root 2, with angles of 90, pie/4, pie/4?  Where did I get 4?  or 16?  When this happens, everything becomes a blur and I go into panic mode which made it worse.  I probably couldnt have told you that a triangle has 3 sides at this point.  I was lost.<br />
<br />
I did like 4 problems on the test and turned it in.  I got a 36.  Its the lowest score Ive ever received on a test.  I put myself into a position of having to basically ace everything else to get by in this class.  I studied for this test for hours.  I went and saw my doctor because if that happens again, it could ruin everything.<br />
<br />
We talked about some stuff, she gave me some stuff to read about different medicine and Adderall seemed to sound like something that could help me.  I went back to her and we discussed it some more, and I got a prescription for it.  I was scared to take it for 2 days because I dont like medicine and one of the side effects is death.  lol.  I woke up this morning to study for a chem test I had and was having trouble again.  So many formulas getting mixed up with each other.  So I said fuck it and took one.<br />
<br />
I took a shower afterwards, got dressed and walked the dogs.  My dog took a dump which means I have to stand in one spot.  I usually rock back and forth while he does his business.  Not this time.  I stood perfectly still.  I couldnt believe it. lol.  Im 33 and Ive never, ever stood perfectly still.  I came inside and realized I felt really different.  I sat down and read two chapters of chemistry.  I redid all the homework problems.  I went to school and felt like I was on top of the world.  I couldnt stop smiling.  I aced my chem test.  I could close my eyes and see the homework problems.  Then I went to the library and totally finished a group project that we have in scientific writing class.  Totally focused.  My group members were pretty happy after I did it all myself.  lol.  I feel so good its amazing.  I think I have a happy hose inside my head thats just spraying happy everywhere.  I have a trig test tomorrow that Im looking forward to taking.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, theres a lot of railing about medicine for your brain on this board.  While its true there are probably lots of people on these drugs that dont need it, I think that some people really benefit.  I have never in my life enjoyed being at school like I did today.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry about the long post.  I know there are others on this board that have ADHD and Im curious if they have done anything about it, or if they havent.  Im also curious if anyone has taken Adderall and experienced what I have or had bad results.</div>
