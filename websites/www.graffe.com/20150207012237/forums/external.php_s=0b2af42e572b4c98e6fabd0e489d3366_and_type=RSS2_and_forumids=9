<br />
I'm not as tired as others are. Certainly there are people who will win pissing matches with me, but I'm not talking about them, and the person I'm worried about right now is me.<br />
<br />
Because I'm not well, I'm not good, I'm not even decent.<br />
<br />
I know there are people looking out for me in one way or another but I feel like I stepped out of a time machine to replace my 20-year old self at nearly 32. I can't do what that guy did, and that guy was very different and had a lot more to his name than I do.<br />
<br />
Yet, I'm that guy to everyone. It's like my 20's never happened, and not only does that upset me conceptually but it undersells what I've been through and what I've tried to do for myself.<br />
<br />
I know these people are being positive, but it's like they don't even know who I am or what I do or seem to know anything about me anymore. I'm parented by people as if I never worked, never increased my skills or walked around or experienced exactly what I have experienced. I can't get through to them, either. I probably never will...<br />
<br />
I'm tired of everyone. Just everyone. <br />
<br />
I was thinking...March is when I've been at my job in 6 months. It's cold, tiring, and I'm not paid much. My expenses are increasing, I see my career leaving the station, my connection to the university growing cold, my knowledge and expertise held up by what I can grab nearby when I'm doing petty work a computer should be doing.<br />
<br />
I'm worried I'm spinning my wheels even more. Going nowhere. I missed my money-making years, and it's time to take the man that wants to just make some friends and get a companion to just go home to and hug and take it home and forget the prospects of success, independence, escape from poverty.<br />
<br />
I'm still depressed. I'm still painfully alone, and my world is filled with people that only resent me, deride me, see me as the worst of my kind and the worst of people I'm not, and worst of all, they treat me like I'm their bratty child.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of everyone. <br />
<br />
I have everyone telling me what to do, and they all sound crazy. Uniformed, unaware of the problems both nearby and out there, threats, trends, the way the winds are blowing, and worst, they are telling me what to do without understanding or caring about what I want for myself. <br />
<br />
I'm really the only person I know that believes in myself while knowing the score, and right now, I need to figure out if I'm going big or going home, and it doesn't look like I'm going big because I'm so far behind, and I'm treated like I never left the gate.<br />
<br />
Maybe I didn't. Maybe it's time I just went home and made a home life for myself where I have friends I connect well with that are like me. Find a person that will love me and care about me and understand me that I can actually share things with instead of having to ignore or hold back on or try to just forget about.<br />
<br />
I just keep playing defense, keep getting myself through each day, each week, and I have 3 months until I feel like I need to get someplace and get off this 6 hours of commuting for scratch when I should really be trying to put my LIFE back together.<br />
<br />
I would love to be around new people that were more like me and not so old or completely different.<br />
<br />
My decisions are important, and know the decision I want to make will make everyone mad at me, but I don't see where I'm able to go anymore, I feel trapped and stuck, and I'm not going anywhere. I just want to make a home for myself somehow and be around better people.</div>
