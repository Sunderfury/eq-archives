<b>Shadow of the Necropolis</b>
</p>
<ul>
Floating above the Plaguelands, the necropolis known as Naxxramas serves as the seat of one of the Lich King's most powerful officers, the dreaded lich Kel'Thuzad. Horrors of the past and new terrors yet to be unleashed are gathering inside the necropolis as the Lich King's servants prepare their assault. The Scourge marches again...
<br />
Naxxramas is the new 40-man raid dungeon that will present even the most experienced and powerful players with an epic challenge.
</ul>
<p><br />
</p><p><br />
<b>General</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost to unlearn talents will now decay over time. This cost will be reduced by a rate of 5 gold per month to a minimum of 10 gold.
<li>Logging back in after a disconnect from the server has been greatly improved, and players should now rarely receive the message "A character with that name already exists."
<li>Temporary item buffs (e.g. poisons, sharpening stones and shaman weapon buffs) will persist through zoning or logging out.
<li>Fear: The calculations to determine if Fear effects should break due to receiving damage have been changed. The old calculation used the base damage of the ability. The new calculation uses the final amount of damage dealt, after all modifiers. In addition, the chance for a damage over time spell to break Fear is now significantly lower. Note that Fear continues to be roughly three times as likely to break on player targets as on non-player targets. In addition, Intimidating Shout now follows that player versus non-player distinction, while previously it did not.
<li>Periodic Healing: Spells which do periodic healing will now have their strength determined at the moment they are cast. Changing the amount of bonus healing you have during the duration of the periodic spell will have no impact on how much it heals for.
<li>Reflection: Effects which cause reflection will no longer reflect triggered effects separately from their base effects (e.g. Impact, Improved Shadow Bolt, Aftermath, etc.)
<li>Spell and Item Auras with Charges: These auras will now correctly remember their number of charges when you enter or leave an instance, change continents, or log out.
<li>All controlled units will now be titled based on the creature type. All beasts will be referred to as Pets, for example (no matter how they are controlled). Previously, there were several inconsistencies.
<li>Beneficial spells and abilities that target multiple units will no longer consume resources (i.e. mana, rage etc...) if they fail to affect anyone.
<li>Chain targeted spells and abilities (e.g. Multi-shot, Cleave, Chain Lightning) will no longer land if target cannot be seen by the caster due to stealth or invisibility.
<li>Character model transparency has been modified to fix an issue where PC's would appear to have a large hole in their model (be on the lookout!).

<li>Optimization code known as "M2Faster" is now enabled by default. M2Faster can improve performance in crowded scenes when "Vertex Animation Shaders" is turned on. This function can be turned off by setting M2Faster to "0" in the config.wtg.
	<ul>
	<li>Reduces the unique number of vertex shader permutations that we will choose to use in rendering
	<li>Sorts the drawing of items in the scene a little differently to reduce the number of times we re-program the vertex shader hardware.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>PVP</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In an effort to keep their armies better outfitted the Horde and Alliance have both taken it upon themselves to update their available rewards.
	<ul>
	<li>An updated set of armor rewards have been added to vendors for Honor ranks 7, 8, and 10.
	<li>The armor rewards for Honor ranks 12 and 13 have been increased in level and stat point allocation.
	<li>New rank 14 weapons have been added! In order to give casters the same diversity of selection that melee currently enjoy we have added new caster items that are available to be purchased by Grand Marshals and High Warlords.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Battlegrounds</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Alterac Valley
	<ul>
	<li>Most of the NPC guard units have been removed.
	<li>Players now drop more quest items.
	<li>Creatures that remain in Alterac Valley have had their hit points reduced.
	<li>The buff that is periodically cast by each faction's Captain has been changed to a flat 20% hit point buff.
	<li>Upgrading troops through armor scrap turn-ins will also now result in your team's General enabling a periodic buff to your melee and spell damage.
	</ul>
<li>This buff scales from 10% at the Seasoned unit level, 20% at the Veteran unit level, and 30% at the Champion unit level.
<li>Warsong Gulch	- Epic leggings have been added to the Warsong Outrider and Silverwing Sentinel supply officers for all armor types.  These items require Exalted status with their respective reputations.

</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Druids</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Innervate: This spell is now a base ability for all Druids, trainable at level 40. Any Druid who formerly had the Innervate talent now has the Swiftmend talent instead.
<li>Nature's Grace: You will no longer consume this effect when casting a spell which was made instant by Nature's Swiftness.
<li>Swiftmend: This new talent has been added to the Druid Restoration tree, replacing Innervate as the 31 point ultimate talent. It consumes a Rejuvenation or Regrowth aura to produce an instant heal.
<li>Enrage: Tooltip edited to clarify functionality.
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Hunters</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Counterattack (Survival Talent) - All ranks of this talent will now share the same cooldown.

<li>Scorpid Poison: Duration slightly lengthened.
<li>Changed the way hunter pet family armor bonuses and penalties are applied to allow the exact value from the Natural Armor talent to be applied correctly. This may result in a very slight loss of armor to some pets (less than a third of a percent).
<li>Improved Scorpid Sting: The aura from this Sting will now be removed (as intended) when a different Sting aura is placed on the victim.
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Mages</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Due to significant talent changes, mages will have all talent points refunded and can be respent. Training costs for all talent spell replacements have been significantly reduced. </b>

<li>Amplify Magic - Damage and healing bonus increased on ranks 2 through 4.

<li>Fire Ruby now has a sell value and can be disenchanted.
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Paladins</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Benediction: This talent will no longer incorrectly provide a double discount to Seal of Justice.
<li>Blessing of Light: It is no longer possible for a target to appear to have multiple ranks of Blessing of Light. These multiple auras had no beneficial effect, merely causing confusion. Problems with targeting the spell when the caster has Blessing of Light effect on them have also been fixed.
<li>Divine Favor: It is no longer possible to cast this immediately after a healing spell and "retroactively" make it a critical hit.
<li>Illumination: When several critical effect healing spells are cast very quickly, you will now receive the correct mana refund for each one.
<li>Judgement of Command: Now consumes a charge of the Zandalarian Hero Charm. In addition, when this spell is resisted it will no longer erroneously still do damage.
<li>Judgement of Righteousness: Now consumes a charge of the Zandalarian Hero Charm.
<li>Seal of Command: Clarified tooltip.
<li>Vengeance: Seal of Command critical hits can now trigger this ability.
<li>Vindication: This effect will no longer be absorbed by Grounding Totem.
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Priests</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightwell - Casting time reduced. Lightwell object increased in size to make it easier to click; relative click radius decreased slightly.

<li>Mind Control: If you cast Power Word: Shield while Mind Controlling a target, the Recently Shielded aura will now appear on the correct target instead of yourself.
<li>Spirit of Redemption: This spell has a number of fixes: Spirit of Redemption form now has casting animations. Priests prematurely leaving battlegrounds with this aura on will now receive the Deserter debuff (as intended); Priests in Spirit of Redemption form at the completion of a battleground will have the aura removed without dying; It will now work correctly with the Darkmoon Card Twisting Nether item, resurrecting you after Spirit of Redemption has run its course; If you should die underwater the Spirit of Redemption will no longer have a breath bar appear; the Warlock Drain Soul spell will terminate producing 1 shard when the Priest switches to Spirit of Redemption form; You will no longer have to wait 30 seconds for graveyard resurrection upon your first death while using Spirit of Redemption.
<li>Vampiric Embrace: This ability will no longer heal for damage caused when the target had no life remaining.
<li>Shadowguard: This Troll Priest racial spell now works with Vampiric Embrace, Blackout, and Shadow Weaving. In addition, the damage from Shadowguard will now consume charges of the Zandalarian Hero Charm's Unstable Power aura. The range on Shadowguard has been extended to hit anyone within vision range.
</ul>
<p><br />

<ul>
<li>Detect Traps is now a passive skill.

</ul>
<p><br />

</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadow Ward now has a new rank (Rank 4) available as item loot in dungeons. The amount of damage absorbed by this ward was increased substantially on all ranks.
<li>Soul Link: If your pet is banished, Soul Link will stop functioning until Banish wears off. In addition, Soul Link's tooltip has been clarified to indicate it only works with your imp, voidwalker, succubus, or felhunter.
<li>Curse of Agony: The damage from this spell will now continue even if the caster dies or leaves the area.
<li>Emberstorm: This talent will now correctly increase the damage the Warlock takes from Hellfire.
<li>Hellfire: Aftermath can now be triggered by this spell.
<li>Improved Shadow Bolt: Periodic damage spells and non-damaging spells will no longer consume charges of Shadow Vulnerability.
<li>Shadowburn: If you cast Drain Soul while this aura is on the victim, you will no longer receive two soul shards upon the victim's death.
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Shaman</b>
</p>
<ul>

<li><b>Due to significant talent changes, Shaman will have all talent points refunded and can be respent. Training costs for all talent spell replacements have been significantly reduced. </b>
<li>Anticipation: Now increases chance to dodge by 1-5%.

<li>Healing Stream Totem: This totem now receives increased healing from effects that increase the Shaman's healing.
<li>Lightning Bolt: Mana cost reduced approximately 17%.
<li>Lightning Shield: Some battleground power-up effects were consuming charges of Lightning Shield. They no longer cause charges to be consumed. The range on Lightning Shield has been extended to hit anyone within vision range.

<li>Searing Totem: This totem now receives increased damage from effects that increase the Shaman's spell damage.

</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Warriors</b>
</p>
<ul>

<li>Bloodrage - Fixed a bug that caused Bloodrage to cost twice the intended health.
<li>Flurry: The tooltip for this talent has been adjusted to indicate it only works on normal melee swings.
<li>Shield Slam: This ability has received a redesign. It now costs 20 rage to use and the damage it does is modified by your shield block value. However, the base damage has been reduced. It generates more threat per rage and more damage per rage than it did previously.
<li>Sweeping Strikes: This spell has a number of fixes: When used in conjunction with Execute and the second victim is below 20% health, they will be hit with the full Execute amount. If the second victim is not below 20% health, they will be hit with normal melee swing damage; If the ability you are using does not deal damage, it will not use a charge of Sweeping Strikes; The extra attack it generates when used with Whirlwind now has the correct damage range; The additional attacks generated by this ability will now properly take into account the armor of the second target.
</ul>
<p><br />
<b>Items</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Key rings have been added to the game.
	<ul>
	<li>Level 1-39 = 4 slots

	<li>Level 50-60 = 12 slots
	</ul>

	<li>Prison Cell Key
	<li>Crescent Key
	</ul>

	</ul>
<li>We have re-evaluated the mechanics of consumable items in the game and concluded that these should work in a more intuitive manner. As such, most items that can not be equipped with right click abilities have been streamlined into one of three categories. Using an item of a particular category will trigger a shared cooldown among all other items in the same category. The categories break down as follows with category cooldowns as listed.
	<ul>

	<li>Potions 2 minutes: This includes items such as Health Potion, Mana Potion, Invisibility Potion and Mighty Rage Potion.
	<li>Aggressive 1 minute: This includes items such as explosives, Really Sticky Glue and Discombobulator Ray.
	<li>Non-Aggresive 2 minutes: This includes items such as Healthstone, Night Dragon's Breath, Whipper Root Tuber and Target Dummy.
	</ul>
<li>Many items that can be equipped have had their cooldown category removed and will be controlled exclusively by the item's self cooldown. For example, the Gnomish Mind Control Cap should no longer trigger the cooldown of the Talisman of Arathor.
<li>We have re-evaluated the class specific quest rewards for both Zul'Gurub and Ahn'Qiraj Ruins. To bring them more in line with the effort required to attain them we have upgraded the superior items to epic quality.
<li>Updated the set bonus tool tip for The Elements and The Five Thunders set to better explain it's function

<li>The Gnomish Mind Control Cap may now only be used on targets that are not in combat.
<li>Deathdealer's Spaulders were unintentionally given higher stats than they should have had for an item of their level, this has been corrected.

<li>A number of items have had their stacking limits increased including leather, enchanting dust/shards and rogue poisons/reagents among others.
<li>Ashwood seeds can now be placed in herb bags.
<li>All food/drink can be eaten while silenced. Previously some food/drink could not be consumed when under the effect of a silence.
<li>The Mantle of the Timbermaw will now make the correct inventory sounds.
<li>The Spirit of Zandalar will no longer persist through death.

<li>Blade of Eternal Darkness: This item can now correctly trigger its effect from any harmful spell.
<li>Bloodfang Set Bonus: The damage effect from the 8-piece bonus on this set will no longer trigger on (and break) Gouge.

This is primarily to combat graveyard rushing in instances.
<li>Zul'Gurub
	<ul>

<li>Text that a raid leader sends to chat will now be displayed in a different color and will have the [Raid Leader] label.
<li>There is now a new raid warning chat channel available to raid leaders and assistants. Text that is sent to this channel will appear in the center of the screen for all players in the raid. The channel is called Raid Warning and text can be sent to it with "/rw"
<li>Raid leaders now have a Ready Check button on their raid interface. This can also be sent with /readycheck from the chat line. A Ready Check sends an "Are you ready?" window with Yes/No buttons to all players in the raid. The raid leader will get feedback in 30 seconds on all the players who were not ready or who did not respond.
<li>Players now have a Raid Info button on their raid interface that functions the same way /raidinfo worked before. 
This function will display a pane showing all of the raid instances that a player is saved to, rather than displaying it to the 
chat window.

	<ul>
	<li>You only get the reset all instances option if you are a party leader.

All players in the party/raid will see the selected symbol over the head of the target as well as on the portrait of that target.
<li>Players can now turn on the "Target of Target" in the Raid and Party section of the interface options. When this is turned on, anytime a player is in a party or raid, it will show the portrait and health of whatever your current target has targeted. You can click on that portrait to target that thing directly or if you have the spell glove up you can cast spells on the target of target without targeting it directly.

In addition when a party member is struck by one of these four types of negative effects, their portrait will pulse the appropriate color for 30 seconds or until the effect is removed.
<li>Using &lt;Shift&gt;B at the bank will now toggle open/closed all of your bags and all of your bank bags.
<li>When you are at the bank and your open bags would start to overlap with your bank pane, your bags will scale down to a smaller size so you can access all of your bags and the bank at the same time.
