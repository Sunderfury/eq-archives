The only time GoM increases your dps is if you are holding back on casting due to mana consumption.  If GoM allows you to cast a spell you normally wouldn't, then there is a small dps upgrade, but nowhere near 10%.</div>

		<div>Well, I don't have the best tanks on the server to nuke behind.  I suppose your mileage will vary, but I find Gift of Mana to be worthless on raids.<br />
<br />
90% of the time my nuking is limited by my aggro, not my mana.  Bigger crits are aggro-free damage, which is why I love them so much.  This may also explain why I rate Silent Casting and Hastened Mind Crash so highly.  I use both on raid targets to increase my damage.  I never run out of mana during raids.<br />
<br />
Gift of Mana is fairly useful in groups, if it goes off when the mob is near half life.  If it procs too early, the tank won't have enough aggro and you either have to use your GOM on an inferior spell, or nuke anyway knowing you'll probably get summoned and hit a few times.  It is also quite frustrating to have Gift of Mana go off on a killshot and then have nothing to nuke with your free spell.<br />
<br />
I should check my logs, but I seriously believe that I cast Ether Skin more often than any other spell while Gift of Mana is active.  Of course, if you solo a lot, Gift of Mana is certainly your best buy.<br />

		<div>Quesci - 10% of nukes are free, and most people use gom almost exclusively with EF while grouping, which adds way more dps than your baseline, so the total dps gain if you got every gom to EF would be well over 10%, I think they calculated it at 125 sustained dps (which is well over 10% over any length of time more like 25-30% of sustained).  However you can't always fire EF on gom, so I err'ed on the side of caution and said 10%, because it resonates with the amount of extra nukes gained.</div>

Varessa, 10% of the time you can cast Ether Flame instead of a lesser nuke.  *IF* EF is a full <b>100% more dps</b> than the lesser spell AND you can cast EF every time GoM procs, then you get a 10% overall increase in DPS.<br />
<br />
But by your calculations above, EF is only a 25-30% increase in DPS over baseline.  If 10% of the time you get a 30% increase, your overall increase is 3% (and that assumes you can cast EF <b>on every single GoM proc</b>).<br />
<br />
As Shoogie mentions, most of the time our casting is limited by aggro.  If GoM lands early, you might hold off on casting an EF to let the tank gain aggro.  If GoM goes off near when the mob dies, you have nothing to cast on and have to refresh a rune or something.<br />
<br />
If your casting is limited more by mana than by aggro, then GoM is a greater DPS increase.  Nevertheless, if there is a solid DPS increase of 2% I'd be surprised.  GoM is more of a mana preservation AA than DPS increase.<br />
<br />
We call GoM the wizard killer, because wizards are tempted to cast a big nuke when we really shouldn't, so in that case I guess you could say that your DPS increases -- until it bottoms out at 0 when you are summoned and killed because you needed to cast Ether Flame with the mob at 98%.</div>

Heh heh, you're right, I got the crits first!  I had forgotten about hastened mind crash, too.<br />
<br />
If you tend to solo AAs like I do, and then raid other times, Shoogie has the right list.  GoM is SO valuable soloing.</div>

		<div>I was speaking about sustained dps, and you're talking about instaneous dps. GoM + EF nets you a theoretical +125 sustained dps (when a 100% uptime baseline is like 250 dps).  I'll agree that on raids GoM doesn't add much.  I almost never change my pattern to use a GoM because I run the aggro line so close anyway -- but grouping GoM is pure wizardly bliss.<br />
<br />
Yes, to get full use out of GoM you have to run the ragged edge a bit, I have a hotkey I use when I'm firing a GoM at a full life mob to tell the tank to brute force the aggro a bit (I almost always group with knights), and I'm likely to use SC or MC just to get a bit more push out of GoM while grouping.  Its all about evolving your playstyle, and the playstyle of your group, to meet the needs of maximum DPS.  Before DoDh, we'd not have a mob in camp constantly, but post DoDh we run full burn 100% until enough people go OOM that we can't continue then we med.  <br />
<br />
From personal experience, my average total damage per hour while grouping almost doubled with Pyro3, MoF3, and GoM3+EF.</div>

For a raiding wizard, GoM is a minor mana preservation increase.<br />
For a soloing wizard, GoM is a decent mana preservation increase, allowing for greater DPS with inefficient, high damage spells.<br />
For a grouping wizard, results will vary from very minor to very significant based on the temperence of the group, the wizard, the nature of the mobs, the pull strategy, and the downtime.</div>
