		<div>I just had a GM come and dupe my char to verify this bug and was able to so he had to submit a bug to the Developers...<br />
<br />
Basically the problem is that Flashfire RKII, Cold Snap RKII (Though this doesn't effect Cloudburst Strike RKII) and Patient Harvest RKII all do not work in Icefall Glacier for me.  The spell gem is up when you zone into the zone, but if you try to cast it, all spell icons go dark and nothing happens... all other icons refresh except for any of the above.  You can click on them while they are dark and you get OOR messages or the like if they are OOR.. but if the mob is in range, all icons go dark again (Like it's casting) and then just come back on with nothing happening.<br />
<br />
The only zone this seems to be happening in is Icefall Glacier :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, just wanted to see if anyone else was having this problem<br />

Unfortunately that doesn't work :( The GM himself was able to confirm the bug (Though at the time I didn't realize that harvest was effected as well)</div>

		<div>Sounds like recast timers on your spells got messed up somehow (since all the spells mentioned have longer recasts), which would explain why a copy of your character would have the same problem. I have seen AA timers have a problem at times where they went to a negative value in some circumstances, which gave them a refresh time of weeks. I wonder if it is the same kind of problem, since (just guessing at how they store the values) a signed short storing tenths of seconds would result in about a 50ish minute refresh time.<br />
<br />
Did he replicate the bug on the copy or just verify that your timers weren't refreshing?</div>

He had the exact same bug on the copy of my character, so basically he was able to verify that the big was in fact a bug.<br />
<br />
I want to do a couple of quests that involve Icefall (Didn't realise you could do the bracer quest twice) but it's really annoying when 2 of my main spells (Flashfire and Harvest) don't work!! (I usually use Sothgars, Run away, cast flashfire while running then stop and cast Sothgar again etc etc while kiting)</div>
