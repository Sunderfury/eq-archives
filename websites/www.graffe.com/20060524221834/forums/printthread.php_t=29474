		<div>Well Iv been having a problem now with my quest book, in fact the problem is one one that I created but can't undo.  Here it goes, what happened was I was issued a Wholesaler task, I don't remember what it was but it said I finished it, I go to turn it in and I can't.  Nothing happens, Iv been to both the npc's in the crafting centers that I'm a member of and tried to turn in, But I can't, I probably along the way in a area where I was not playing allot sold them to a vendor or sold them at my house market, or maybe even destroyed them its hard to tell(As I started the quest back in November).  But the bottom line is I don't know what it was I was going to make or harvest.  So in a effort to restart my task's I send in a CS Ticket(petition) to have them aid with the problem, and id request that they just delete the quest for me, because for some odd reason I can't.  Why would I post here<br />
<br />
#1) Because every SOE CS Rep I talk to tells me to ask my fellow players for help, so I need one of you to delete this from my quest log or tell me what It is I need to make, because I forgot two months ago.(Probably cant right, so thank you SOE for nothing)<br />
#2) I think its very annoying the way this rep took my problem to handle, he simply responded though the ticket and never gave me a chance to add comments to his or to maybe make clear what it is that I wanted before he shut my door.  In fact to tell the truth this reminds me of the Support I get from HP from India and they suck.  Just the tone of the msg the open/close/solved and I got to get to the next 10,000 of these because I'm the only one SOE paid to handle ALL the tickets.<br />
<br />
Anyway take a look at this screen shot of his response.  SOE's support has gone down hill from the day they took it over from Variant.  And it looks like they want my money but don't want to help with my problem,s not to mention it was five hours before this one got answered and the one I placed in JUST after this still has not gone answered. (And thats over 15 hours) Thank god I'm not stuck in the ground or somthing. <br />
<br />
I love how he says he's sorry three times then makes no effor to help me, He rather just pass me off to the &quot;Players knowlage&quot;.<br />
<br />
On the left is my Quest Journal, I have the task selected that I am having problems with and note how I can't delete it, and it don't tell me anything about what the task was, so I can restart.  Then on the right is my coments sent into SOE, and a responce by GM Vivido<br />

		<div>You do realize that the support you get IS from India right? SOE outsourced all their GM services about 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
Wholesaler and workshop task quests requires you to have the material you gathered / crafted on you to hand in. You simply will have to restart the quests if you sold the items. It's made this way so you can't simply finish the task, sell off what you harvested, and get quick silver, gold from the quest while not handing out anything. Strange that you can't delete the quest though, just repetition and hope for a better GM.<br />
<br />
You also have to realize that this is the same GM team from Everquest that got outsourced to India. While the developers and Moorgard are much better then their EQ counterpart, the GM team is still the same old, same old. You think you had a weird response? Try explaining to the GM that your shard was locked in an expired instanced zone which were bugged at the time, and that he doesn't understand that a bug exists and kept repeating the same 2-3 lines about how you can click the door for the shard. Guildmate had to repetion to get a competent GM to summon the shard.</div>

		<div>You can switch tasks once every 24 hours or so before you &quot;complete&quot; the task.  After you completed the task I think your shit outa luck unless you know what you made and get that number of items on your person when you hail the NPC.  I've also /bugged that we are unable to delete tradeskill quests like that several times.  Do you have any clue what items you needed to make?   If so you need to keep those items on you when you hail the NPC to get the coin/credit.  Do you by chance keep logging on?  Might go back and look, though this might be very time consuming to sort out.<br />

I haven't gotten any of these tasks since I had a similar issue with them my self.</div>

<br />
If you paid for eq2players you can check your level on Nov.23, but assuming you started near launch you were most likely 10-19 and Tier 2.  Wholesalers want 15 of 1 of 6 items, you will need to buy (really cheap) or gather the possible items.  You can kill animals instead of harvesting nodes for pelts.<br />
<br />
Tier 1 : tin, lead, malachite, root, elm, sullied lq pelt<br />
Tier 2 : iron, electrum, turquoise, tuber, maple, sullied avg pelt<br />
<br />
Wholesaler Tasks aren't deletable to prevent people from being able to simply cycle the quest until they got the easiest task.  There is a 5 min delay for changing your task from the Wholesaler.  Obviously more than 5 min have elapsed and you can't change your task, this is an issue with changing Tiers, you have levelled to 22 (Tier 3) adventurer and this prevents the Wholesaler from deleting your Tier 1 or 2 gathering task.  Levelling as an artisan can also change your Tier if it's higher than your adventurer level.<br />
<br />
The GM you spoke to should be aware of the changing Tier issue and should have sent you a canned response on that topic, you probably know more than me about where to submit the complaint about poor CS if you want to call out the GM for his failure.<br />
<br />
The issues with this could be simplified by leaving open the Collect 15 ______ step and simply place a check mark beside it and then show the next step as return to wholesaler.  I've had the issue when running low on bag space and trying to remember which item I need to keep to complete the task and would be handy to know I need carbonite and can delete all my belladonna and sullied pelts.</div>

		<div>Looked at the SS again and it says you created all the items for the Wholesaler, that's the text for Workshop Tasks, not Wholesaler Tasks.  Most likely you just got the Quest before the Text was updated and it's indeed a Wholesaler Task and simply gathering the items will complete the quest and net you 3 or 12sp.<br />
<br />
I've never done a Workshop Task and have no idea if they were an either or quest along with Gathering Tasks initially.  If that is a crafting task you will need to get ahold of a useful GM to delete the quest or get lucky crafting low level items.  The only chance to find out what item you were crafting would be if you take a lot of SS, in which case you can check those and you would probably have a SS or 3 with the text of the task or inspecting a pair of burlap mitts you made for the quest long ago.<br />
<br />
I still wouldn't think it was crafting though, I couldn't really see any reason you would finish making your last crafting item and then leave without hailing the Wholesaler, but stranger things have happened.</div>
