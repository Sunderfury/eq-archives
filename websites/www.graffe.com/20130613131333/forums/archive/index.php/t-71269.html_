Has anyone heard of it? And / or can tell me anything about it?  Being able to stream is unusual since you cant maintain a ratio that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 lot of the good torrent shit you got to be on some waiting list to join a group and upload like crazy. really tho thats the safest one to join because the gov't most  likely cant track ya since it's a private torrent. :)</div></div><hr />

They call it &quot;streaming mode&quot;, but that's not perfectly accurate. Practically, it's the same thing, but at the end of the stream you also have the torrent.</div></div><hr />

lol.  My 7 year old daughter found a &quot;green koopa&quot; (Mario reference) for sale on the Internet somewhere today for ONE PENNY.  I told her it sounded too good to be true.  <br />
<br />
I told her that usually means it is.  <br />
<br />
And she asked, &quot;that usually means its TRUE?&quot;<br />
<br />
