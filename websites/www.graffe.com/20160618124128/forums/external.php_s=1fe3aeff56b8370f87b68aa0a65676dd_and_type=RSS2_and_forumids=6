<br />
Because evidently that's the only way you can respond to getting burned by a middle schooler. <br />
<br />
From the article:<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			In the meantime, as the science blog Respectful Insolence noted last week, the doxxing and “unmasking” efforts began in earnest. Let’s remember that this is, again, in response to a Facebook video made by a 12-year-old, in his backyard. <br />
<br />
But a virulent portion of the anti-vax movement is, as we wrote last year, comfortable harassing, threatening, and revealing the personal information of people they disagree with. That evidently extends to children; a blogger named Levi Quackenboss wrote two posts speculating that Arturo is “a hoax” and “a little catfish,” a “pawn” of his parents and/or the pharmaceutical industry: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
'So people, you’re not interacting with Marco. You’re not reading Marco. Even in the video, you’re not truly listening to Marco. His parents have made him into a pawn. They tell him what to believe and what to say, then edited it to make him look like a debate genius. Marco, as you think you know him, does not exist. The only true Marco on Facebook is the one talking about his love of little green lizards.'<br />
<br />
In her next post, she strongly insinuated that she had discovered all sorts of things about his family:<br />
<br />
<br />
'So who is Marco? I’m not going to post his full name out of respect for him and his parents as well as their safety, but they’ve been a little sloppy about making trails to it so they should clean that up.' <br />
<br />
<br />
The main *gasp* huge reveal, according to Quackenboss’ deranged pseudo-investigative deep-dive, appears to be that Arturo’s stepfather might be a doctor. That would explain why Arturo is interested in science. It still wouldn’t be proof that vaccines secretly cause autism.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Yup, 12 year old owns your discredited bullshit belief, time to bully him and his family! <br />
<br />
And of course this :<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			One of the underlying theories that’s emerging here is that Arturo was created as a puppet or a shill to oppose the movie Vaxxed, made by Andrew Wakefield, the former gastroenterologist who was the lead author on the now-debunked study linking vaccines and autism
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Because folks need MORE help disproving that specious piece of rubbish from proved charlatan and fraud Andrew Wakefield.</div>

<br />
Carl's jr chose a strange name for their new sandwich, &quot;the california classic,&quot; and i understand why. If they called it something a little more on the nose like, &quot;the doouble trouble&quot; or &quot;not the animal style burger,&quot; they might actually instigate a lawsuit. But for what it is worth, if there has never been a good in-n-out facsimile, there definitely is now. <br />
<br />
Im not an in n out addict, and their burgers are mostly just a treat because their service is so high scale that they will never get an order wrong. That and dipping their fries or cheeseburger in their chocolate shakes are something only someone who has had their fill of similar sensual conquests exhausted years ago. <br />
<br />
That being said, there are times when a double double sounds like a great idea, but the drive, and wait in line, does not. <br />
<br />
Carl's jr pulled it off. Not the shake, and definitely not the fries, but if in a pinch and desiring in n out, there is something that mosy of the country can now have. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah.hardee's.....  Southern weirdos.</div>

			A 22-year-old Dutch woman who was detained for three months in Qatar on suspicion of adultery after she reported being drugged and raped was given a one-year suspended sentence on Monday and will be allowed to return home, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said.<br />
<br />
The woman, identified only as Laura and described as being from the Dutch city of Utrecht, was held and prosecuted on charges of adultery and alcohol consumption. She has been fined about 750 euros, or nearly $850, and will be sent back to the Netherlands, said Daphne Kerremans, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Foreign Ministry.<br />
<br />
“The ambassador is with her now and is making sure that she can go home as soon as possible,” Ms. Kerremans said. “It was quite overwhelming for her.”<br />
<br />
News reports said the man Laura accused of sexually assaulting her had also been detained and had told Qatari authorities that the sex was consensual. They said the man, who has not been formally identified, had been punished with 140 lashes for illegal sex acts and public drunkenness.<br />
<br />
The woman’s lawyer, Brian Lokollo, told the Dutch news media that the woman had gone in March to a hotel in Doha where alcohol is permitted.<br />
<br />
She felt unwell soon after taking the first sip of a drink and realized that something was wrong, he said. The next morning, she awoke in an unfamiliar apartment and realized that she had been raped.<br />
<br />
After reporting the attack to the authorities in Qatar, Mr. Lokollo said, she was detained, according to The Associated Press.<br />
<br />
The case captured global attention over the weekend after the woman’s family spoke in the Dutch news media about her arrest, and reports of the accusations and imprisonment she faced drew a campaign on social media calling for her release.<br />
<br />
The decision by soccer organizers to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar brought increased scrutiny to the human rights record of the tiny, oil-rich nation, and the rape case added to those concerns.<br />
<br />
Among the concerns of rights groups are the treatment of women and the labor conditions of migrant workers helping to build the infrastructure for the games.<br />
<br />
The Dutch Embassy in Qatar said it had been helping the woman from the moment it learned of her arrest.<br />
<br />
“We have provided assistance to her since the first day of detention,” it said in a statement issued before the verdict. “For the sake of the defendant’s case, we will not make further comments at this point.”<br />
<br />
Although alcohol consumption is largely illegal in Qatar, it is legally available at some upmarket hotels. Adultery is illegal in the conservative Muslim country.<br />
<br />
In 2013, a Norwegian woman who was working in the United Arab Emirates received a 16-month prison sentence for illegal consumption of alcohol, unlawful sex and perjury after reporting to the police that she had been sexually assaulted by a colleague. She was eventually pardoned and allowed to leave the country to return home.

Fifty killed in Florida nightclub shooting, worst in U.S. history<br />
ORLANDO, FLA. | BY BARBARA LISTON<br />
<br />
A gunman killed 50 people at a packed gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida on Sunday and wounded 53 others before being killed by police in the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.<br />
<br />
The shooter was identified as Omar S. Mateen, a Florida resident who a senior FBI official said might have had leanings toward Islamic State militants. Officials called the rampage a &quot;terrorism incident,&quot; but cautioned that the suspected Islamist connection required further investigation.<br />
<br />
Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said the attack was the deadliest single U.S. shooting incident, eclipsing the 32 people killed in the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech university.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today we're dealing with something that we never imagined and is unimaginable,&quot; Dyer said, more than doubling an earlier estimate that about 20 bodies were found in the Pulse nightclub.<br />
<br />
A police officer working as a security guard inside the club, which has operated in downtown Orlando since 2004, exchanged fire with the suspect at about 2 a.m. EDT, police officials said.<br />
<br />
A hostage situation quickly developed, and three hours later SWAT team officers used armored cars to storm the club before shooting dead the gunman. It was unclear when the gunman killed the victims.<br />
<br />
One officer was injured after he was hit in his helmet while exchanging fire with the gunman, police said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we consider this an act of terrorism? Absolutely,&quot; said Danny Banks, special agent in charge of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. &quot;Whether that is domestic terrorist activity or an international one, that is something we will certainly get to the bottom of.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
&#8250; Islamic State-linked account posts photo purported to be Orlando nightclub shooter<br />
Asked if the FBI suspected the gunman might have had inclinations toward militant Islam, including a possible sympathy for Islamic State, Ronald Hopper, an assistant FBI agent in charge, told reporters: &quot;We do have suggestions that the individual may have leanings toward that particular ideology. But right now we can't say definitively.&quot;<br />
<br />
The FBI said it was still trying to pin down whether the mass shooting was a hate crime against gays or a terrorist act.<br />
<br />
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida told CNN he understood that the gunman had worked for a security company and so would have undergone some background checks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Over the next couple of days they're going to be looking to see where this individual was inspired to carry out this horrifying act of terrorism,&quot; Rubio said. &quot;I think we're going to be talking about a very different kind of case here soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
President Barack Obama ordered the federal government to provide any assistance needed to Florida police investigating the shooting, the White House said in a statement.<br />

<br />
The attacker was carrying an assault rifle and a handgun, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said. He was also carrying an unidentified &quot;device&quot;, Orlando Police Chief John Mina said earlier.<br />
<br />
Javer Antonetti, 53, told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper he was near the back of the dance club when he heard gunfire. &quot;There were so many (shots), at least 40 ... it was constant, like 'pow, pow, pow,',&quot; he said.<br />

Video footage showed police officers and civilians carrying some injured people away from the club and bending over others on the ground. Dozens of police cruisers, ambulances and other emergency vehicles could be seen in the area.<br />
<br />
Pulse, which was crowded for a Latin music night, describes itself on its website as more than &quot;just another gay club.&quot; One of the founders and owners, Barbara Poma, opened it more than a decade ago in an effort to keep alive the spirit of her brother, who died after battling HIV.<br />
<br />
The choice of target was especially heart-wrenching for members of the U.S. lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, LGBT advocacy group Equality Florida said in a statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gay clubs hold a significant place in LGBTQ history. They were often the only safe gathering place and this horrific act strikes directly at our sense of safety,&quot; the group said. &quot;We will await the details in tears of sadness and anger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Orlando has a population of 270,930 and is the home of the famed Disney World amusement park and many other tourist attractions that attracted 62 million visitors in 2014.<br />
<br />
It was the second deadly shooting at an Orlando night spot in as many nights. Late Friday, a man thought to be a deranged fan fatally shot singer Christina Grimmie, a former contestant on &quot;The Voice&quot;, as she was signing autographs after a concert. [L1N1930E6]<br />

<br />
It is true that women would still get raped, however their would be less indisputable evidence that the prisoner did get raped compared to having men around. And no false rape reports involving men and women.<br />
<br />
While DNA is fallible, it is going to be much harder to win that lawsuit in court, so having only women as COs and only women rapists as a result, the organization running the prison would be a lower risk of lawsuit and have a better chance of winning rape related lawsuits.</div>

			Stephen Colbert is having a bad week. I think it’s fair to say this is one of the worst weeks we’ve seen a late night talk show host have since the Conan O’Brien The Tonight Show fiasco in 2010. This is not to say things are just going swimmingly everywhere else – Trevor Noah is still experiencing lackluster ratings and has yet to turn his The Daily Show into a cultural force – but the strange series of events that has followed Colbert around this week is, well, unusual.<br />
<br />
Where to start…<br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Well, first, Colbert lost longtime producer Meredith Bennett, who had been with him since The Colbert Report. As Deadline reported, when new showrunner Chris Licht was hired, it was expressly stated this wouldn’t affect Bennett’s position – this turned out not to be true.<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Then James Corden goes on Howard Stern’s radio show and is asked about potentially replacing Colbert as the host of The Late Show. Corden handled this about as well as one can in a situation like that, saying, “never gonna happen,” but now that’s out there. It’s in people’s heads that this could be a possibility. Are there rumors that this has been discussed internally at CBS? Well, yes – which is probably why Stern brought it up in the first place. But substantiated rumors or not, now the host of The Late Late Show had to issue a denial. People only ask this kind of thing when blood is in the water. Would Seth Meyers be a good host of The Tonight Show? Yes. Are people asking him if he’s taking over for Jimmy Fallon anytime soon? They are not.<br />
<br />
If egos and network embarrassment weren’t a factor, switching Colbert and Corden actually makes some sense. Corden hosts the more carnival-type atmospheric show – which has a similar vibe to Fallon – which seems to work well in the 11:35 time slot (and on the internet). Not to mention that Corden is in Los Angeles and he wouldn’t have to directly compete with the New York City-based Fallon for guests, like Colbert does. (If you’ve paid attention to Colbert’s guests at all in the last few months, Colbert does not often win this battle with Fallon.)<br />
<br />
Colbert at 12:35 could allow Colbert to just be himself again and book the intellectuals that he likes to talk with. One of Colbert’s biggest problems is he just looks so damn uncomfortable playing the role of an 11:35 p.m. late night host. People say he was playing a character on The Colbert Report? The truth is, he’s playing a character right now, and he’s not very good at it.<br />
<br />
<b>3.</b> I had heard some rumors a few months ago that The Late Show was trying to figure out a way to incorporate executive producer Jon Stewart into the show. How far this idea actually got, I have no idea, but this was before Chris Licht was hired. And when I first heard this, it was still at a time when something like this would work without seeming desperate. Now, yeah, Colbert would get hammered for doing something like this. It would be seen as desperate.<br />
<br />
Then this past Monday, Jon Stewart winds up appearing on Samantha Bee’s Full Frontal. It’s a fun cameo. It doesn’t mean anything in terms of Colbert’s show, but it just has the appearance of Stewart kind of, sort of endorsing Bee’s show when Colbert is having this kind of week. Of course, again, that’s not what is happening. (And I will repeat, Stewart is an executive producer on The Late Show.) It’s just not the best timing.<br />
<br />
<b>4.</b> I think at this point it’s a safe bet to assume that David Letterman isn’t the biggest fan of Stephen Colbert’s Late Show. At the very least, he has no opinion. But David Letterman has never been the type of person to ever hold back when he wants to praise another comedian. For instance, we know exactly how he feels about Amy Schumer and Billy Eichner. When he’s ever asked about Colbert, he always says something along the lines of, “I had nothing to do with that.”<br />
<br />
<br />
A clip of an upcoming interview with Letterman by Tom Brokaw surfaced and Letterman expanded on this. We already knew Letterman had no input on his replacement, but added, unprompted, “And I don’t know why they didn’t give my show to a woman.” (The context of that quote is a little hard to convey, so I will add it was said in the tone of, “It makes no sense to me they didn’t give my show to a woman.”)<br />
<br />
Can Colbert recover from all this? I honestly don’t know the answer to that question. No one is questioning Colbert’s talent, but I do wonder if this is the best fit or avenue for his talent. He just seems a little lost. Right after Licht took over, some small changes were made to make the show immediately better, like ditching the cold open monologue. But I’ve been watching a lot lately and the same old problems persist: disjointed and dated comedy segments, and Colbert’s lack of interest in guests he doesn’t care about.<br />
<br />
I’m going to write something that’s going to sound like a dig, but it’s not meant to be and I will explain more after I write this next sentence: Colbert’s The Late Show reminds me a lot of Jay Leno’s The Tonight Show. Okay, now here’s where I try to explain this: Jay Leno was actually pretty good at hosting his version of The Tonight Show. Maybe I didn’t particularly like it and you didn’t particularly like it, but a lot of people liked it. Leno played to the heartland. (I am originally from the Midwest, so that is not a dig at our heartland.) And he was pretty good at appeasing that crowd. He didn’t offend anyone. He seemed like a nice enough guy (when he wasn’t conniving against other late night hosts) and he put on broad, lowbrow humor and people watched it. So be it.<br />
<br />
Stephen Colbert’s show is doing the same thing. A couple of weeks ago, Colbert stood on stage and read the story of the 2000 election as a bedtime story. It was basically a Leno joke. And it even ended with an innuendo that Colbert might end with a rhyming “cuss word,” but then he didn’t and the studio gasped and Colbert gave some weird grin in a, “can you believe I almost cussed?” kind of way. It was all really terrible.<br />
<br />
And that’s Colbert’s biggest problem: He wants to be an all encompassing “America’s Host” when that’s not at all what Colbert is. Colbert is smart and he’s divisive and he has opinions. Yeah, I get that old line, “Republicans watch television, too,” but the world doesn’t work like that anymore. You can still “play to everyone,” but it’s in the form of what Fallon and Corden do. Stephen Colbert dancing around the stage with Skrillex just seems off – and from the body language of Colbert, I bet he knows it’s off, too.<br />
<br />
I still hold out hope the “old Colbert” will come back before this presidential election is over, but my hope is slim. I don’t think that Colbert is coming back. Our political satire will rest squarely at the feet of Seth Meyers, Samantha Bee, and John Oliver. (I truly believe Oliver wanted his show to just be about shedding light on subjects that need it, but Oliver is now begrudgingly accepting his comedic pundit role, just because so few others are doing it well at this point.)<br />
<br />
But there’s Colbert, dancing around with Skrillex, trying to make everyone happy … but as long as this continues, no one is happy.

Will scroll down a bit to stop mouseover previews from revealing anything.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, here goes the spoiler thread.<br />
<br />
Will scroll down a bit to stop mouseover previews from revealing anything.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
My thoughts (sort of ramblish):<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
<br />
Needs more humor, other classes than warrior, and magic needs to be extremely commonplace - not just confined to a very select few.  <br />
<br />
Long:<br />
----<br />
Decent story - it works as the giant set-up cannon for the universe.<br />
The whole Fel-Medihv setup was neat, and you really felt him deteriorate through the movie.<br />
<br />
Personal theory: Medivh is Garonas father? Would also explain why he tried bringing the orcs to Azeroth, since he basically wanted to save his daughter from certain destruction.<br />
<br />
My biggest gripes:<br />
I really really wanted more of the WoW humor in there - Sooooooooo happy they used a sheep, though.<br />
But, really, the humor has always been permeating the games - from the exploding critters to the pissed-off soldiers/grunts when you clicked them. It was MISSING in a VERY big way.<br />
It was very seeeeeeeeerious seeeeeeerious world, and that's a damn shame.<br />
<br />
Veeeeeery harsh on the Green Jesus cliches. Yes yes, Thrall is our last hope, yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
That the collective war-council blankly accepts the whole: &quot;Yep, I got better, nothing to see here! - Now go march off into extremely dangerous territory, I'll meet you there, TATA! *poof*&quot;<br />
was a bit far fetched.<br />
<br />
---<br />
Extreme lack of dwarves/elves, plus the look of the elves were somewhat more Blood/Highelf than Night Elf, IMO.<br />
If you follow the games chronologically, the lack of other races does makes sense. <br />
<br />
Sad consequence: If the movie makes enough money to spawn sequels, I won't get my wish to see a WOTLK-movie until we're way into the 2020s. FeelsBadMan.<br />
<br />
And speaking of lack of things - I missed the following units from Warcraft I game:<br />
<br />
Archer / Spearman<br />
Catapults<br />
Cleric / Necrolytes<br />
Conjurer / Warlock<br />
Water Elemental / Daemons<br />
<br />
Basically, it was a mass of mounted and unmounted Warriors.<br />
<br />
In the movie, Magic was concentrated into an extremely few characters - very strange, since magic-wielding units were fairly commonplace in the first game.<br />
And if we cross into Vanilla WoW: Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock and Warrior as playable classes - six magic-wielding classes.<br />
Whatever magic was in the movie was extremely well-made, but if the movies REALLY end up in the WoW universe, magic needs to permeate everything and be extremely commonplace.<br />
<br />
I mean, after Callan died, my son and I turned to each other and said: &quot;REZ PLZ!&quot;. Magic is THAT common :)<br />
<br />
Overall, though, I'm pretty hopeful now - more so than when I went in to see the movie with my many many years WoW baggage.<br />
<br />
If the movie does well, we can get a stream of movies expanding on the Warcraft universe.<br />
It needs to survive until I can get my sweet, sweet WOTLK: The movie. Pleasedon'tfuckthatup!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>as said before, the &quot;Biosocial&quot; belief on illness, i.e. that many illnesses are psychosomatic, is a load of horseshit<br />
it *IS* modern day Eugenics, <br />
it's based on arrogance (to put Elites above peons who's &quot;<i>weak minds make them sick, proving they are untermensch</i>&quot;)<br />
to deny them welfare(so Elites don't have to pay tax)<br />
to deny spending on research and treatment (again to avoid tax and because the Elites don't care and want us to die off)<br />
to scare people by making a social bogeyman/pitfall to be afraid of<br />
<br />
Note the shit about stomach ulcers, SAME THING<br />
those bastards lied for decades about stomach ulcers being caused by stress, there was NEVER any evidence it was caused by stress and they fought to deny any research or publicity that it was actually caused by a bacterial infection<br />
SAME bastards used to routinely accuse women here in UK who had Multiple Sclerosis of being &quot;Hysterical&quot; and had them marked down as psychiatric patients and given wrongful drugs or even &quot;sectioned&quot; in mental wards<br />
<br />
I've been fighting for over 3 years to *STAY ALIVE* because of these EVIL BASTARDS<br />
to put it mildly I am *PISSED*<br />
but their crap, their &quot;Emperor's new Clothes&quot;, their deep links with government and sinister groups like Spiked/Living Marxism is increasingly being called into question by folk other than us patients<br />
this tissue of lies has being used as an excuse to push more &quot;austerity&quot; cuts<br />
it has lead to the deaths of THOUSANDS of people in the UK<br />

this is modern day &quot;witch hunting&quot; or whatever, we patients got branded as &quot;nuts&quot; for accusing this as unscientific and a conspiracy<br />

			‘Biopsychosocial’ basis for benefit cuts is ‘cavalier, unevidenced and misleading’ <br />
&#61670; 1  <br />
By John Pring  on  June 9, 2016   Benefits and Poverty <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The research that successive governments have relied on to justify slashing disability benefits over more than a decade is riddled with inconsistencies, misleading statements and “unevidenced” claims, according to three disabled academics.<br />
<br />
A new article by Professor Tom Shakespeare and Professor Nicholas Watson, and fellow academic Ola Abu Alghaib, concludes that the biopsychosocial model of health (BPS) “does not represent evidence-based policy”.<br />
<br />
The BPS under-pinned Labour’s out-of-work disability benefit employment and support allowance (ESA) and the work capability assessment (WCA), which has since been linked repeatedly to relapses, episodes of self-harm, and even suicides and other deaths, among those who have been assessed and found fit for work.<br />
<br />
BPS has also “played a key role” in the tightening of eligibility criteria for ESA and other disability benefits by the subsequent coalition and Tory governments, including the new personal independence payment and universal credit, even though there is “no coherent theory or evidence” behind it, say the three authors.<br />
<br />
The BPS was developed by Dr Gordon Waddell, an orthopaedic surgeon, and Professor Sir Mansel Aylward (pictured), who was chief medical officer for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) from 1995 to 2005.<br />
<br />
Key to the BPS model, say the three authors, is the idea that “it is the negative attitudes of many ESA recipients that prevent them from working, rather than their impairment or health condition”, essentially branding many benefit claimants “scroungers”.<br />
<br />
This allows supporters of BPS – including a string of Labour and Tory government ministers – to draw a distinction “between ‘real’ incapacity benefit claimants, with long-term and incurable health conditions, and ‘fake’ benefit claimants, with short-term illness”, with the model responsible for a “barely concealed” element of “victim-blaming”.<br />
<br />
Shakespeare, Watson and Abu Alghaib say that this distinction “drives media coverage and popular attitudes to disabled people”, by creating this supposed contrast between “the deserving and the undeserving poor”.<br />
<br />
They say BPS has been used to “underpin increasingly harsh and at times punitive measures targeted at disabled people” as the state tries to cut the number of people receiving ESA.<br />
<br />
Their article, Blaming The Victim, All Over Again: Waddell And Aylward’s Biopsychosocial (BPS) Model Of Disability, is published by the journal Critical Social Policy.<br />
<br />
It criticises the willingness of a succession of politicians, such as the welfare reform minister Lord Freud – who has described it in parliament as a “coherent theory” – to base their policies on the BPS.<br />
<br />
Alyward left DWP to head Cardiff University’s Centre for Psychosocial and Disability Research, which for four years was sponsored by the US disability insurance giant Unum, a company that once bragged that UK government policy on incapacity benefit reform was “being driven by our thinking”. <br />
<br />
The article says the centre has worked “extensively” for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).<br />
<br />
In one of their articles, Aylward and Waddell say: “As an oversimplification, capacity may be limited by a health condition, but performance is limited by how the person thinks and feels about their health condition.”<br />
<br />
But Shakespeare, Watson and Abu Alghaib say they have “carefully reviewed claims” made in the two publications, which they say reveals “a cavalier approach to scientific evidence”.<br />
<br />
They point to “inconsistencies” and “misleading statements”, and they say that the authors “rely on unevidenced assertions throughout their work”.<br />
<br />
They add: “Waddell and Aylward slide between general statements that are scientifically valid and specific statements that are matters of opinion or political prejudice.<br />
<br />
“They also tend to cite their own, non-peer reviewed papers extensively.”<br />
<br />
And they point to another quote from Aylward and Waddell, in which they say: “For most people with common health problems, decisions about being (un)fit for work, taking sickness absence or claiming benefits are conscious and rational decisions, free choices with full awareness and intent, for which they must take responsibility.”<br />
<br />
This, according to Shakespeare – who is professor of disability research at the University of East Anglia’s Norwich Medical School – and his colleagues brands such people “scroungers”.<br />
<br />
They say that, rather than “promoting the myth that large numbers of claimants are fraudulent”, the government should focus its attention on ensuring employers are “encouraged, supported, regulated and finally forced to give due consideration to disabled people as workers”.<br />
<br />
They conclude: “Society must accept that work is not always appropriate or possible, and that for many disabled people humane and supportive alternatives to work are needed.<br />
<br />
“These must not stigmatise those who are so supported, nor should non-working disabled people have to suffer poverty and social exclusion.”<br />
<br />
The article is the first academic examination of the BPS, and particularly of two key publications by Aylward and Waddell: The Scientific and Conceptual Basis of Incapacity Benefits (2005) and Models of Sickness and Disability: Applied to Common Health Problems (2010).<br />
<br />
Following the article’s publication, Watson – professor of disability research at the University of Glasgow, and director of the Centre for Disability Research – called for DWP to review the evidence used to drive its policies on out-of-work disability benefits.<br />
<br />
He told Disability News Service (DNS) that the BPS had “been used to drive the WCA”, and that the government now needs to examine “the evidence that they used to create their policies”.<br />
<br />
He added: “I would question very much the foundations that they are built on.”<br />
<br />
He pointed out that none of the articles they analyse in their article had been published in peer-reviewed publications – as theirs was – but instead had been self-published or published by “obscure publishing houses”.<br />
<br />
He said: “If they really wanted to make their case, they would submit their work to peer review.”<br />
<br />
A DWP spokeswoman said the department was not previously aware of the article before it was contacted by DNS, but she added: “We work with experts on disability issues and look at a wide range of evidence when developing policies that will affect disabled people, including the work and health green paper, and we will consider the points raised in this article.”<br />
<br />
DWP said the WCA had been developed in consultation with medical and other experts, including groups representing disabled people, and had been subject to five independent reviews.<br />
<br />
The department said the PIP assessment was also developed with the help of a wide range of experts, and had been subject to a public consultation and thorough testing, as well as an independent review after its introduction.<br />
<br />
And DWP said the authors were not correct to say that the government promotes “the myth that large numbers of claimants are fraudulent” and that “it is the negative attitudes of many ESA recipients that prevent them from working, rather than their health condition”. <br />
<br />
Alyward had declined to comment on the article by noon today (9 June), while DNS has so far been unable to contact Waddell.

</div>the government and the Right Wing press plus seriously sinister scum like &quot;Spiked&quot; and their corporate propaganda spin machine &quot;Science Media Centre&quot; are menace, they've been attacking folk like me with their shit for years.<br />
those outside this crap will of course have a hard time believing it<br />
but please remember the utter lies, scientific fraud and way Monsanto executives evaded prosecution for T-245/Agent Orange<br />
Note parallels with this Biosocial &quot;Push&quot; and Eugenics, it's the SAME crap<br />
Eugenics was <i>pushed </i>strongly purely as a tool for the powerful, so again they wrap it up in pseudoscience to make it seem &quot;reasonable&quot; to a modern audience.<br />
<br />
this shit would never be accepted in other fields of Science, but Medical science = money/power/control<br />
:/</div>
