<br />
<br />
(NBC) - In the 90s, as part of a campaign to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, parents were urged to place their babies on their backs when sleeping.<br />
 <br />
It was successful, but it had unintended consequences.<br />
 <br />
More babies are experiencing plagiocephaly - the misshaping of the head.<br />
 <br />
Six-month-old Kaydence Hershman is a bundle of joy, but early on, her parents noticed that something was not quite right.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Her head every week was becoming more and more misshaped,&quot; said her mother, Kristina Netherlain.<br />
 <br />
&quot;The symmetry in her face was changing very fast. Her jawline was flattening, this eye was getting smaller, this ear was coming forward.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Kaydence has flat head syndrome, also known as plagiocephaly.<br />
 <br />
The numbers have risen dramatically in part because parents are placing babies on their back when they sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS.<br />
 <br />
As a result, &quot;babies spend a significant more amount of time on their backs, causing this flathead shape,&quot;<br />
 said Katie Stalnaker, a clinician at Cranial Technologies.<br />
 <br />
She said if the problem gets worse and goes untreated, it could lead to other health issues down the line, such as, &quot;Jawline issues such as TMJ or underbite, eye and ear misalignment in addition to a concern of the airway passage potentially being shortened, causing sleep apnea or swallowing issues&quot;.<br />

I'll make a killing designing special harnesses you put the baby in, with  supporting straps in a radial pattern around the child, pulled tight enough to ensure movement is not possible.<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually, it looks like all you need are special pillows. Dang, and my plan was so perfect!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dramadon</div><div class="date">May 14th, 2011, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My daughter has this. The thing is, the flat head part of it is easily correctable and usually will fix itself within the first year. So, while it's slightly annoying, it's a lot easier to deal with a misshapen head than it is to deal with SIDS.<br />
<br />
Just so you know, she was diagnosed with plagiocephaly a month ago and has already shown considerable improvement. Basically, let your kid have as much supervised tummy time as possible and help them sit up a lot so they aren't constantly putting pressure on the same area. Worst case scenario they give your baby a hockey helmet to wear to prevent pressure on one place. Once the skull bones fuse together the risk for plagiocephaly goes away. Of course, if the baby's head is still funny shaped when this happens is when the other issues can start to become problems.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Bose-Einstein condensate research shows promise in this area. I think the biggest hurdle (after the small problem of &quot;dang, it seems we can't make much of this at once&quot;) will be the energy source.<br />
<br />
At least the energy source will not have to be as powerful as would be necessary to utilize B.E.C. to create a warp bubble....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, after the first test they did indoors in a concrete bunker, they had to spend days scraping the flattened goo and deformed melted prototype from the walls and ceilings where it impacted with a few thousand mph. For some reason, when they started it up, not only the planet, but the whole galaxy arm moved away from the test site.</div></div><hr />

Perfection would be gaining a repelling force of 1g.  since on earth just standing there you are subjected to 1g.  in theory a opposite force of 1g would allow neutral buoyancy in air.  hmm then apply to random large metal construct,  add propellers and bam you have a Final Fantasy style Airship!</div></div><hr />

Actually, as far as I understand it, Zero Gravity has some pretty serious side-effects on astronauts. Somehow it completely weakens their bones like severely advanced osteoporosis. That'd be even worse on an infant who's still developing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daph</div><div class="date">May 15th, 2011, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm glad my daughter was born back before the days of all these issues.  I had occasional glasses of wine, smoked, and when she was born fine, always placed her on her stomach to sleep.  When she was a newborn, the only way she would sleep any length of time at all was if her head was smooshed up against the corner of the bumper pads, on her stomach.  I tried putting her down on her back and all she did was scream.<br />
<br />
And that is not to say I'm advocating drinking alcohol while pregnant, or smoking either. Just stating a fact as it pertained to me and my baby...well, and my mom's four kids too...</div></div><hr />

Well that is constant zero gravity that does that,  sleeping is actually almost as bad for the bones.  but its not something we do constantly,  however people who are stuck in beds also get brittle bones.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately we have no control of gravity just yet so we cannot do experiments on weather or not sleeping in zero-g but going day to day at 1g would be better or worse.  we would need a new space station or a huge ring module on the current one that spins at 1g to ever test such a thing.</div></div><hr />

That explains so much!  Joking &lt;tease&gt;. :)</div></div><hr />
