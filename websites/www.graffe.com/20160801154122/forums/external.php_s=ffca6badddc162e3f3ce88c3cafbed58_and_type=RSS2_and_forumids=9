			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>unless I eat VERY slowly in teeny bits, I get like an &quot;air lock&quot; when eating, not like normal choking you can get when food goes wrong way, no this is painful as hell and you can't breath or spit it out (stomach and nerves are all to buggery and aint' working right)<br />
only way to break it is to drink liquid and try and gulp to break the &quot;lock&quot;<br />
then you blow chunks<br />
ridiculous how it happens with so little.<br />
<br />
so I forgot and chewed an apple like normal, most of way through it and....<br />
result choking to death can't breath  trying again and again to swallow juice to break the fucking lock<br />
finally managed it and <i>BWAAAAA! </i> <br />

<br />
then nearly choked normal way trying to inhale to draw the shit out of my nose....FUCK!!!<br />
<br />
hate hate FUCKING HATE this, probably gonna kill me one day<br />
Couple of times had to toss meself half out of bed to hang upside down to let it drain out (woke up acid reflux, choke, strangle, fuck fuck fuck)<br />
<br />
first &quot;good&quot; day had in weeks and got that, bah! <br />
if I ever find the joker who decided to screw me up like this I am SERIOUSLY gonna have words with him her, they or it<br />
deities, spirits, Matrix Programs or gremlins, they are gonna get FUCKED! see how they like a ball pein hammer rammed up their ass and doing the in-out like a fiddlers elbow with that and NO grease for them, sand and chilli sauce lube for the pricks! :grinyes:</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have 8 baked potatoes, Freshly baked, in an electric oven, in tin foil, since I've done for as long as I was old enough to operate a goddamned oven or some tin foil.<br />
<br />
I needed to use the potatoes before they went bad, so I was thinking &quot;Hey, I love baked potatoes, I'll bake them and then I can take them as leftovers to work.!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I thought:<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, when I was a kid we had not only mashed potatoes, but TWICE BAKED mashed potatoes! Those things were awesome!&quot;<br />
<br />
Boy, I wish I'd written that recipe down or saved it somewhere, but that's not a problem, I can find almost anything on the intarpipes!<br />
<br />
...or perhaps I can't?<br />
<br />
Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo &quot;twice baked potatoes&quot; and it doesn't matter if you hit -sour -cream or any other level of switches because what you get is:<br />
<br />
FOODIE FUCKING RESULTS INVOLVING KALE, BLEU CHEESE, OR FUCKING WATERCRESS GARNISH!<br />
<br />
Mind you, I can fucking punt by mashing my own potatoes and adding milk and cheese until things reach the right consistency, but 5 years ago, my search engine results would have turned up dozens of recipes that were PERFECTLY FUCKING GOOD if you just wanted to do something simple.<br />
<br />
Now?<br />
<br />
NoOoOoOoOoOoO.<br />
<br />
We can't have that.<br />
<br />
ATTENTION IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY!<br />
<br />
WE MUST ALL CRAFT OUR CUSTOM HEARTACHE IN SPECIAL WAYS TO REFLECT THAT WE&quot;RE SUPER SPECIAL!<br />
<br />
It's not just heartache! We're super special Sneaux-flakes! <br />
<br />
That's super cool because I added a dash of something into the equation that only just copied one recipe from a blog. That one special thing was only a comment, but it's on MY blog now!<br />
<br />
And just because I said &quot;sneaux-flake&quot;, with what you people call a dash or a hyphen, you can call it that if you want, but that's so *horribly* dated that it's like Emeril saying &quot;BAM!&quot; and that's not done anymore. It's a proper pause for emphasis, like Samuel Beam does in that one Iron and Wine song before starting the next phrase.<br />
<br />
Whatever happened to Betty Crocker recipe cards that involved simply reading instructions instead of paragraphs full of exposition on why you were inspired to come up with something and then giving an exposition on various levels of crap before you got to oven temperatures and tablespoons?<br />
<br />
I've been railing against tv shows involving &quot;cooks as rockstars&quot; for years, but this is precisely what we get when we do this.<br />
<br />
It's high school fucking chemistry experiments, you self-humping idjits.<br />
<br />
Stop pretending it's more.</div>
