		<div>Another preview of SoF went out today on Casters Realm:  www DOT castersrealm DOT com /index.php/everquest/permalink/eq_expansion_preview/<br />
<br />
[Please note that because I don't have 10 posts, I can't post a URL, so you have to fix the spacing and dots yourself]<br />
<br />
Things that were said is:<br />
<br />
&quot;this latest expansion gives us over 1000 AA points (broken up into 1/3rd new abilities and the rest enhancements on existing) to gather with a supplemental AA release in 6-9 months&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizard Revamp The way wizards work/cast has been completely redone, so expect some major Burnage from your pointy hats!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Melee Soloable mobs (mostly in Dragonscale Hills)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;where do I get my spells (ok maybe not! but still) These are the locations of your Tier 1 (of 3 tiers just like last expansion T1=Vendor, T2=Mob Dropped, T3=Raid) <br />
<br />
(76) Ellymil Cogswin located in Dragonscale Hills at 910, -530 <br />
(77) Kedem Teague located in the Loping Plains at -2320 , -520 (SE of bloodmoon keep zl) <br />
(78) Inizen Nogglezop in Fortress Mechanotus at 890, -1455 <br />
(79) Naene Ebonlocke in Hills of Shade at -63, 1477 <br />
(80) Seyan Ebonlocke in Hills of Shade at 980, -575 &quot;<br />
<br />
Obviously reading the entire preview provokes curiosity, but I guess I'll wait till the actual NDA is lifted.<br />

Shame shame!  I am sooooooo gonna report you!  <br />
<br />
You might as well post the other nasty surprises they have in store for us with SoF (since you're already screwed).<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the change you mentioned, why would they do that?  One of the devs had stated that the only instant that had any real negative reprecussion was cloudburst.  So making changes to the other 2 while allowing us to still chain cloudburst in the right situation was something I could live with.  But now it's worse than what we have now, and our old version was already nerfed once!</div>

Qaman likes the changes and has been rationalizing their impact. I personaly belive he is no longer suitable to be our CC but that again is a minority opinion.<br />
<br />
I am also of the mind that Instants are the future for our class. They are superior in every way to anything we had in past and are the most fun part of playing this class.<br />

SoF is death for instants, there are no numbers Prathun and Qaman can show me to make me like new spells.</div>

		<div>I don't understand why changes to our primary DPS modes are necessary if the development team is on record as acknowledging that there is a growing gap between melee and caster DPS. Especially changes that seem to be, from what's being said here, straight nerfs across the board. <br />
<br />
Not every wizard has the Veteran AAs or mana pool necessary to pump out the levels of DPS that a very small minority within our class can produce, and even they can only produce those numbers in specific circumstances or against specific mobs. Meanwhile, in the content that the rest of us that actually play this game are experiencing, we're watching in bewilderment as we get destroyed on DPS charts by rogues and zerkers, and sometimes even monks, with warriors creeping up behind. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, I don't understand the concept of nerfing a class based on the performance of the top 1%, especially in the face of the fact that high performance is constant for classes like Berserker, or melee in general, which receive a much better return for investment on things like their &quot;focus&quot; - Cleave, Imp Dodge, etc. which do not degrade over level increases - and have an easier time of pushing into top tier DPS roles. For a Berserker, it is seemingly as easy as putting together a couple groups to finish their laughably non-difficult 2.0, stacking on some +atk gear, and typing &quot;GG&quot;. <br />
<br />
If any of the changes, other than the beam change, that I have heard are going through actually do go through, someone at SoE deserves a hard kick in the junk, and our CC with him.</div>

The fault with instants was not instants, it was what was arount them. We simply had nothing else to use. So we used only instants.<br />
When WMS was fixed we were exited like WMS is such a great nuke and all of us used it extensively. Truth be told WMS is not such a great nuke but compared to what else was there it was light years away.<br />
It does not take great imagination to make wizards a very exciting and effective class with predifined goals. We are burst DPS, we ought to be called to unload large amount of dmg in a short timeframe. Instants are ideal for this and there is no reason to kill them. You just need to build around them.<br />
What bugs me the most is the arguments against instants, most notably how they scale too far. Wizards in fact have tools to scale damage over 1 to 2 min timeframe better than any class in game. Hello, thats exactly how it should be, we are supposed to be able to do that. What is the problem. What logic in saying we should not be ahead in 2 min parses over any class. in a 5 min fight most high DPS classes are ahead of us. We do not cry about that.<br />
Prathun is a wierdo. He has no clue what he wants. He does things at the whim. He has it in for us since April. Even though situation is totaly different today he is nerfing us as if it was April 2007.<br />
There are things to like in SoF on the spell side. Hey if you take a nuke and make it cast in half the time that can only be good. WMC and CI have 0.75 sec cast time, got to love that. Problem is, you now have some of what we should have had in TSS but you don't have instants. That's no good.<br />
He simply cannot see what the freaking game is all about from a perspective of the player. Why do I have too trade nukes this way. Why don't you fucking make me happy and give me both. If you think DPS is too high lets cut the numbres down to size. There is no reason you should make me chain instants only or not be able to chain them at all. There is a very simple way to find middle ground.</div>

I've basically tuned out from the topic since the intent of the wizard nerfvamp became clear. ,to stop us from doing damage on the run.<br />
<br />
<br />
Revamp is the BS smokescreen being blown up your asses to confuse us from the fact they are acting on their sole intent, to stop us from nuking on the run. <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree a lot with what Gavrillo is saying. Instants were a lot more to me than just great dps. IT enabled me to do a lot. I can kite summoning mobs now. I can tank raid trash and actually kill it before it kills me like this.<br />
<br />
Tell me im wrong, but i havent heard anything since they clearly stated their intent to stop us from nuking on the run many months ago, that anything more than that is happening to us.</div>

There will be instants, they are still instant, they even produce much higher dps.<br />
<br />
However, depending on the rank they will have 8.5, 8.25, 8 sec recast.<br />
<br />
There is also upgrade to CBS, it shares timer with other 2 nukes, but you can chain it every 3 sec as long as you don't use other instants. Trouble is it is 1537 mana. Think about it, this is outrage, 3.6 DPM is lower than any nuke we have. It means, in almost all situations, you are better off using Manaburn. Prathun is saying I don't want you using this!!!<br />
<br />
Kiting with 8.25 recast is a joke. We are going back to snare kiting without upgraded snare.</div>

		<div>I'm not really speaking specifically on the nerfs one way or the other. One thing I would like to address before that talk gets started, though, is that the changes to instants are indeed just that, nerfs. Some people have already started claiming instants weren't nerfed, &quot;they're just changed&quot;, but Prathun himself admitted as much in a letter to the community on the beta boards. <br />
<br />
What I'm referring to is more of the fact that a lot of the fundamental core of our class is being tinkered with to help compensate for abilities that neither the developer in charge of creating them nor the CC that's supposed to represent us had any foresight in designing, testing, or presenting. Whether or not you think that tinkering is detrimental or simply a &quot;change&quot; is another issue.</div>

<br />
As far as the instant nerfs, Prathun made it very clear that he DID hear our opinions on the matter -- he just didn't give a shit about them.  Some wizards may feel that if you don't get your way, you should just scream louder until you do, but a community rep that acted that way wouldn't be one for long.</div>

I have a lot of respect for Qaman, he has been our CC for many years, you have to give him due respect.<br />
<br />
For me Qaman's failure is his inability to sway Prathun on what is that wizards want. This is not about headline DPS this is about playing wizard and having fun.<br />
Qaman as I see it became Prathuns CC and not our CC. He passed Prathuns ideas and tried to sway us into accepting them.<br />
<br />
Prathun is a fickle beast, I understand that Q had to keep balance or he would not even get a response from Prathun. Thats all good, diplomacy is a subtle business but results are what matters.<br />

		<div>melees are sustaining 2.2 to 2.5k OVERNIGHT in the arena. this isn't with their discs or anything either. i think this is going to be the big problem for all casters this expansion because all we got are the spell upgrades and those are not upgraded enough for most.<br />
 <br />
as for the instants, yes the changes sucks nuts worse than the movie hard candy and wont be able to chain em anymore but overall  not losing to much damage compared to what was there before. main problem is it just isnt enough damage compared to melees. actually a bit concerned even warriors and bards might be  parsing closer to us this expansion lol. <br />
<br />
lastly i would expect to be hearing about spells for the months to come and probably end up waiting 6 months before anything is done about it. the spells are probably the worse set in the history of eq and prathun is to blame because he didn't do crap with spells sinse the start. that aside everything else looks pretty good.</div>

My question is, do any of you have a solid set of numbers?  It will be interesting to see how we stack up between TSS and SoF spells on raid mobs.  Granted, they may be higher but if other classes, such as beastlords, bards, warriors, etc close ground on the dps field, are we still going to be considered a &quot;dps class?&quot;</div>
