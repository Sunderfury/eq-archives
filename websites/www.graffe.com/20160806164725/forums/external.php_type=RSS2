			HAGATNA, Guam — A 95-year-old Catholic priest admitted to sexually abusing boys decades ago on Guam, and said he confessed his sins to other priests on the island at the time but none told him to specifically stop.<br />
<br />
Instead, the Rev. Louis Brouillard says in a telephone interview with The Associated Press they told him to do regular penance, such as saying Hail Mary prayers.<br />
<br />
Brouillard said he hasn't been defrocked, and lives in Pine City, Minnesota, on a small pension from the church in Guam. He said he offers daily prayers for the boys, and says he hopes they would forgive him.<br />
<br />
After Brouillard's confessions were first reported this week by the Pacific Daily News, Archbishop Savio Hon Tai-Fai conveyed his &quot;deepest apologies&quot; to the victims.

			Lily Tomlin made history yesterday when it was announced that she would be the first openly gay performer to receive the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award.<br />
<br />
Since its inception in 1962, the honor has been awarded to Hollywood legends such as Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor, Audrey Hepburn, Paul Newman, Julie Andrews, Sidney Poitier, Angela Lansbury and Carol Burnett. <br />
<br />
SAG-AFTRA President Gabrielle Carteris says the 76-year-old Tomlin is the perfect choice to join this cast of luminaries because she is “an extraordinary actress, as equally adept at narrative drama as in comedy roles.” <br />
<br />
“She has an ability to create diverse and distinct characters that are at once familiar, eccentric and oh so honest–in a way that illuminates life’s hidden corners,’ Carteris adds. <br />
<br />
“From Edith Ann to Frankie, her characters are wholly unique, and by exposing every nuance of human behavior, they widen our scope of understanding.” <br />
<br />
Tomlin’s career began when she was cast in the NBC sketch comedy show Laugh-In in 1970. There, she created a number of memorable characters, including crowd-favorite Ernestine, a nosy and condescending telephone operator (pictured above).<br />
<br />
From Laugh-In, she went on to make her mark in film (Nashville, 9 to 5, Prairie Home Companion and Grandma), on stage (The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe) and on TV in her current role as Frankie opposite Jane Fonda in Grace &amp; Frankie. <br />
<br />
Tomlin, who married her longtime partner Jane Wagner in 2013 after 45 years together, will be presented with the award at the 2016 ceremony in January 2017.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Loved the movie.  Best DC movie to date (not as awesome of a statement as it should be)<br />
<br />
I think they handled almost every single character very well.<br />
<br />
If there is a concern its that people who didn't have the exposure to comics wont get some of it, but my lovely lady really enjoyed the movie and she didn't know about any of it.  Her only real comment was I wish there was more Joker.<br />
<br />
The play between Harley and the Joker seemed to really nail the spirit and fun that I remember from Batman the Animated Series, without making the Joker a joke.  He did a superb job, very different than Heath, but he really felt like the Joker to me.<br />
<br />
Amanda Waller hit me like she did in the original run of of the comics.  Almost as Evil (if not more so) than the bad guys and tough enough to have a screaming argument with Batman.  She made a few mistakes that would be out of character for an experienced waller, but seemed legit for a person getting used to the idea of meta humans and how to deal with them.<br />
<br />
I really liked Captain Boomerang.  This may be the first movie where I thoroughly enjoyed that actor.  If any complaints pop up, its that he didn't get enough lines, but that can be said about everyone but 3 people.  Capt B suckering Slipnot into running for it made me happy.  I knew Slipnot wasn't long for the world just from the previews and honestly because he was slipnot.  I even expected him to be the &quot;we aren't bluffing guy&quot; but I was glad they let boomerang talk him into it.<br />
<br />
Killer Croc.  Wanted more of him, but seemed a good fit.  Wish he was bigger, but to do him like I'd probably want it would have been CGI and this probably made it better.  Full CGI characters are still a bit hard for me to &quot;believe&quot;  Honestly I've been a fan of Adebesi since OZ.<br />
<br />
Deadshot.  Technically a bad guy, but they used the Anti-hero version of him.  Its shocking they gave Will the starring role I know, but it was handled very well.  Maybe he was a bit too nice, but he was obviously the one that was center stage for showing that he was a Bad Guy vs an Evil Guy.  I highly suspect he will show up in some other movies as bit parts and future Suicide Sqauds will probably run like they did in the comics with him taking the role of Rick.<br />
<br />
Harley.  Awesome.  Again... very much the feel of Harley from the Animated show.  When she called him Mr. J the teenage boy in me was so happy.  It wasn't even a special event, just casually throwing it in.<br />
<br />
Rick Flagg.  Well, he was Rick Flagg.  He did what he was supposed to do.  He shines like he did in the comics.  Which in my opinion was a place holder until Deadshot takes over.<br />
<br />
Enchantress. I liked the dirtyish costume more than the ancient queenish looking costume.  Seemed a good version of what I remember, but she never really stood out from my comic book days.<br />
<br />
Diablo.  Really liked how he was handled the whole way through.  I liked him so much I was sad when he died.  I would hope they could figure out a way to bring him back, but probably not a good idea really.<br />
<br />
Batman was ok.  I liked the exchange between Bruce and Amanda at the end and it was the best use of him in the show.  I can't be disappointed in the other parts too much because it was more of a Stan Lee pop in , than a role.<br />
<br />
They blended the music into the movie really well.  And unless Harley had an ipod with a Joker mix that she could play I don't think they could have tied it more directly in, but the musical choices where very good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plot.  Notice how I havent talked about it much...  Well With all those characters there isnt a ton of room.  Basically Go get person X out of hell city or we blow off your head.  Hey this didnt work out like we thought.  Guess we have to actually STOP the EVIL (not BAD) guy or else we get blamed.  Yay we win!  This was very much a vehicle to get this many people in the movie, get them to say stuff we want to hear, and have a fun bad guy road trip movie.<br />
<br />
I hope everyone likes it as much as me.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>For the past year, chewing and cold have caused a fuckton of pain on my lower left molar.  My dentist thought it was a receding gum line and that my root was hypersensitive.  He tried a few surface fillings on the tooth to stop the pain (with no luck).  So he finally recommended a root canal - which is good since it turns out the tooth is cracked and has been for over a year.<br />
<br />
Now, the root canal SUCKED.  It was not the pain, it was the inability to breath with my head tilted that far back and my mouth wide open.  Rubber dam also did not help.  Could not breath through my mouth and I could feel my tongue blocking part of my airway (shocking considering I have sleep apnea).  60 minutes sitting in the chair with the Dr's hands and tools in my mouth with a bite block to keep my mouth open and feeling like I could only get 25% of the air I needed - GOOD TIMES....<br />
<br />
Then about 40 minutes in my left shoulder started to ache severely.  Something about sitting back in a chair that is not wide enough to support your shoulders.  Yeah, good times...<br />
<br />
All that being said, the actual root canal portion was relatively painless.  All the other crap made me wish I had asked for the tooth to be pulled</div>

			HOUSTON (KTRK) -- Houston police announced the arrest of two men accused of stealing about 30 Jeep and Dodge vehicles. Authorities say they did it by using a laptop computer.<br />
<br />
Police say they've been watching these guys for a while but were never able to catch them in the act stealing Jeeps - until last Friday.<br />
<br />
Police say Michael Arce and Jesse Zelaya stole more than 30 Jeeps in the Houston area over the last six months.<br />
<br />
And this is how they reportedly do it: Investigators say they hook up a laptop to the Jeep, with pirated software, simply turn on the SUV, and drive it off. In many cases, the Jeeps are unlocked, so they don't have to break in.<br />
<br />
Police finally found Arce and Zelaya, because back in April a person who had his Jeep stolen had surveillance video of the crime as it took place. That helped police big-time.<br />
<br />
Officers tracked down Arce and Zelaya, and started watching their every move -- and recording them.<br />
<br />
Then, last Friday, police say they caught the thieves stealing Jeeps in the Memorial area and arrested them. Arce, 24, is charged with felon in possession of a weapon, possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Zelaya, 22, is charged with unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.<br />
<br />
The scary part about all this - there's not much you can do to protect yourself from something like this.<br />
<br />
HPD Officer Jim Woods said, &quot;No matter what you do, you have to realize, somebody has the ability and the knowledge to steal your car. They're going to be able to take it. There's not a whole lot you can do about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Homeland Security launched their own investigation, and discovered since November 2015, more than 100 stolen Chrysler SUVs were stolen in this way, and driven across the border.<br />
<br />
It's possible these two arrested in Houston could be tied to a much larger operation.<br />
<br />
Fiat Chrysler confirms an internal investigation is underway after more than 100 of their vehicles were stolen in the Houston area.<br />
<br />
FCA spokesman Berj Alexanian explains that employees at Fiat Chrysler dealerships, independent repair facilities and locksmiths have access to databases that list the key codes that pair key fobs with the particular vehicles they open and start. The automakers believes some of those employees have sold their username and passwords to those databases to criminals.<br />
<br />
Those criminals then buy cheap generic key fobs, find a vehicle, break into it, find the vehicle's VIN number, log onto the database and boom -- they can reprogram the key fob, start the vehicle and drive away.<br />
<br />
Essentially, it is modern-day hot-wiring of a car. The automaker is asking owners to be sure their vehicles are in a secure location at night and are locked.<br />
<br />
The company issued this official statement: &quot;FCA US takes the safety and security of its customers seriously and incorporates security features in its vehicles that help to reduce the risk of unauthorized and unlawful access to vehicle systems and wireless communications.&quot;<br />
<br />
To date, FCA has NOT been able to identify any employees who may be selling their database access to criminals.

			Other than being the “transportation of the future,” hoverboards’ most notable feature is their propensity for bursting into flames spontaneously. That’s great if you’re a pyro, and less great if you like avoiding third-degree burns. Now, a brick-and-mortar purveyor of these flame-prone scooties has succumb to what most would assume was inevitable—it caught fire.<br />
<br />
You can watch gripping fate of this hoverboard store in Garfield, NJ, right here thanks to News 4 New York’s live chopper team. Currently, they think an overheated hoverboard exploded, which is almost certainly 100 percent what happened. The fire supposedly took just 10 to 15 minutes to get under control, there were no injuries.<br />
<br />
Honestly, this store has been playing with fire from day one.

			Muslim passengers who recently flew on both Delta and American Airlines say they were removed from flights after being told attendants were “uncomfortable” with them remaining onboard. The two women removed from American work for the federal government.<br />
<br />
In a lengthy note posted to Facebook and picked up by BuzzFeed, Niala Khalil said she and a friend were booted off a flight from Miami to D.C.:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Last night my friend and I were removed from American Airlines (AA) flight 2239 traveling from Miami International Airport (MIA) to Washington-Reagan National Airport (DCA) because the main crew airline attendant felt “unsafe” by our presence. Yup, the only two apparent Muslim girls on the plane got kicked off. Not sure if it was my friend’s statement “evil-eye” bracelet, the fact that I was watching a Pakistani drama on my iPhone, or our obvious Muslim last names that made him uncomfortable, but here’s the kicker, we both work for the United States Federal government.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Khalil is a producer and broadcaster for Voice of America, a news outlet funded by the U.S. government. (It was founded during World War II and is sometimes described as pro-U.S. government propaganda.) Her friend also works for the feds but didn’t want to be identified, Khalil told BuzzFeed. <br />
<br />
Khalil wrote that the incident began after the plane was kept on the ground for hours, delayed first by fueling issues and then by weather. A “white, male” passenger behind her and her friend started complaining to them about “the lack of customer care,” she says, at which point a male flight attendant walked by and told her friend she could leave if she didn’t like it:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Suddenly, a male flight attendant walking by singled out my friend and stated, “If you have a problem, you can get off the plane.” My friend replied, “I have no problem—I am simply stating facts. We were given one glass of water in 5 hours.” The attendant responded by once again threatening my friend, “Well, I can have you removed for instigating other passengers.” The flight attendant was not wearing his name badge and did not identify himself.<br />
<br />
Since I was wearing headphones (watching my Pakistani drama), I only realized something happened when my friend’s demeanor changed. She appeared shocked and visibly upset after the attendant walked away.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The women located another flight attendant and attempted to make a complaint, Khalil says. When they saw the male flight attendant again, they snapped a photo of him so the other crew member could identify him, which led to another bizarre encounter with a third attendant: <br />

			After she walked away, we saw him again and my friend took a picture so the female flight attendant could help identify him for us. A third flight attendant walked by and told us that by taking a picture, we were committing a “federal offense”. (Disclaimer: taking a photo of an airline crew member is not a federal offense, but apparently there is a publicly unknown AA policy that crew members can arbitrarily enforce with customers when a photo is taken without their consent.) The initial female flight attendant came back, asked us what happened, and we showed her the picture. She identified the male flight attendant as “Rog as in Roger” and then asked that we delete the picture. We immediately obliged and deliberately showed the flight attendant that we were deleting the picture. Thankfully, we still had the picture saved because it went to the “delete” folder.

</div>In the end, a “customer care” representative for the airline appeared, Khalil says, and the two of them were escorted off the plane and into the waiting arms of police after being told they were making the male flight attendant (identified as “Roger”) feel “unsafe.” But the women weren’t arrested, and Khalil says the AA rep “freely admitted that it was obvious that the flight attendant ‘exaggerated’ the incident.”<br />
<br />
Khalil says she and her friend were initially offered flight and meal vouchers, which somehow didn’t make up for the experience of being kicked off a plane for rather murky reasons. She said, too, that she only got American’s corporate customer service reps to call her back after BuzzFeed posted their story.<br />
<br />
Back in April, American booted Cenk Uygur from a flight, the host of The Young Turks and someone with an extremely sizable social media presence. Again, a flight attendant reportedly got “uncomfortable,” he said, after he complained about a delay of nearly four hours. In July, American denied it had kicked a 40-year-old Muslim engineer off a flight for discriminatory reasons, a story that was less widely picked up because the person involved wasn’t a public figure. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile over at Delta, the Council on American-Islamic Relations says a Muslim couple traveling to Paris were removed from a flight due to, again, an “uncomfortable” flight attendant. CAIR-Cincinnati says it’s filing a complaint against Delta with the U.S. Department of Transportation, and will hold a press conference on the incident Thursday afternoon.

After cutting $3.47 million from public defense in 2015, you now cite fiscal discipline as reason to again restrict MSPD's budget, this time by 8.5%. However, and despite claims that revenues are considerably less than expected, you did not restrict a single dollar from your own budget, and the average withhold from 12 of your executive agencies does not even add up to one half of one percent (.47%).<br />
<br />
...MSPD must hold a significant number of vacant positions open to have the necessary funds to make it through the fiscal year, a task which is exacerbated by a 12% increase in cases over the year prior. To avoid having to close one or more offices, the remaining option is to consider the use of Section 600.042.5, which gives the Director of the Public Defender System the authority to &quot;[d]elegate the legal representation of any person to any member of the state bar of Missouri.&quot;<br />
<br />
...it strikes me that I should begin with the one attorney in the state who not only created this problem, but is in a unique position to address it. <br />
<br />
Therefore, pursuant to Section 600.0642.5 and as Director of the Missouri State Public Defender System tasked with carrying out the state's obligation to ensure that poor people who face incarceration are afforded competent counsel in their defense, I hereby appoint you, Jeremiah W. (Jay) Nixon, Bar No. 29603, to enter your appearance as counsel of record in the attached case. <br />
<br />
Very truly yours, <br />
Michael Barrett<br />
Director</div>

			An American breakthrough might provide a new approach to fuel production and reducing carbon emissions.<br />
<br />
Researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) have developed a solar cell that can convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into a cheap and usable hydrocarbon fuel, using only sunlight.<br />
<br />
&quot;The new solar cell is not photovoltaic – it's photosynthetic,&quot; said Amin Salehi-Khojin, assistant professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at UIC and senior author on the study, in a statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Instead of producing energy in an unsustainable one-way route from fossil fuels to greenhouse gas, we can now reverse the process and recycle atmospheric carbon into fuel using sunlight.”<br />
<br />
The findings are reported in Science, and they showcase a technology that could produce fuel at a cost comparable to the current price of gasoline.<br />
<br />
The cell acts in a similar way to a leaf. While plants convert CO2 and light into oxygen and sugars, the solar cell produces Syngas, a portmanteau for synthetic gas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide that can either be burned directly or converted into diesel or other hydrocarbon fuels.<br />
<br />
The technological success was possible thanks to a nanoflake tungsten diselenide, a specially engineered catalyst which made the reaction 1,000 times faster and 20 times cheaper than using regular noble-metal catalysts.<br />
<br />
&quot;The new catalyst is more active; more able to break carbon dioxide's chemical bonds,&quot; said UIC postdoctoral researcher Mohammad Asadi, first author on the paper. The researchers have applied for a provisional patent for the technology.<br />
<br />
There are about 1.2 billion motor vehicles around the world, which includes everything from motorbikes to heavy duty trucks. Climate change is a clear and present threat to all of us, so we need to strive to move towards a renewable future but we need to be realistic on how to get there. Sustainable production of fuels, combined with better management of resources and energy efficiency, seems like a sound strategy to move beyond fossil fuels.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>We will need this type of technology if we don't want the Earth to be 10 degrees warmer in 150 years. So, I'm sure some oil company will buy the patent for this and then bury it.</div>

			Republican lawmakers are fuming over a bombshell report overnight that the U.S. government airlifted the equivalent of $400 million to Iran this past January – as four detained Americans were released by Tehran – and say the transaction has put more Americans at risk of being taken hostage.<br />
<br />
The cash transfer, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, was the first installment paid in a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a failed 1979 arms deal dating from just before the Iranian Revolution.<br />
<br />
The cash flown to Iran consisted of euros, Swiss francs, and other currencies because U.S. law forbids transacting American dollars with Iran. While the Obama administration denied the cash transfer was done to secure the release of the four Americans, GOP lawmakers said it was tantamount to “ransom.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Paying ransom to kidnappers puts Americans even more at risk,&quot; Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., said in a statement. &quot;While Americans were relieved by Iran’s overdue release of illegally imprisoned American hostages, the White House’s policy of appeasement has led Iran to illegally seize more American hostages.&quot;<br />
<br />
The four released Americans are Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian; Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. Marine; Christian pastor Saeed Abedini; and Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, whose case had not been publicized before the release.<br />
<br />
State Department spokesman John Kirby said their release was on an entirely separate track from the settlement payment and, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News, said any suggestion it was tied to ransom is “utterly false.”  <br />
<br />
“We just don’t pay ransom. … This was not ransom,” he said.  <br />
<br />
Kirby further said there was “no secret” about the payment.<br />
<br />
“It was their money,” Kirby told Fox News, noting the funds had been frozen and it “made no sense for us to continue to drag out their claim.” He argued the “compromise” struck with Iran worked to the “taxpayers’ benefit” because potentially billions more could have been on the line. <br />
<br />
In a written statement, Kirby said the negotiations over the Americans and over the settlement were even conducted &quot;by different teams on each side.&quot; He said: &quot;The funds that were transferred to Iran were related solely to the settlement of a long-standing claim at the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal at The Hague.&quot; <br />
<br />
However, the Journal says U.S. officials acknowledge that Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange said they wanted the cash to show they had gained something tangible.<br />
<br />
The Journal also reported that President Obama did not disclose the $400 million cash payment when he announced Jan. 17 that the arms deal dispute had been resolved. The administration has not disclosed how the $1.7 billion was paid, except to say it was not paid in dollars.<br />
<br />
“The logistics of this payment -- literally delivering a plane full of cash to evade U.S. law -- shows yet again the extraordinary lengths the Obama administration will go to accommodate Iran, all while hiding the facts from Congress and the American people,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., said in a statement. “Hundreds of millions in the pockets of a terrorist regime means a more dangerous region, period. And paying ransom only puts more American lives in jeopardy.”<br />
<br />
Since the cash was airlifted, Iran's Revolutionary Guard has arrested two more Iranian-Americans. Tehran also has detained dual-nationals from France, Canada and the U.K. in recent months.
