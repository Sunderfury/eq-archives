</div>THIS.  The only way out of this is to break them of it.  If they riot over cartoons, print more.  If they still riot take out a full page comic.  If they don't like a movie about Muhammed, make another one that's a gay porn film, if they still bitch, move on to bestiality.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, their entire culture needs to grow the fuck up and pull their heads out of their asses.</blockquote>

</div>I agree, and at the same time I note another problem.<br />
<br />
There is a large (and growing) portion of &quot;western civilization&quot; that thinks the Renaissance/Age of Enlightenment is the worst thing to happen since sliced bread.  This portion of the population is just as busy attempting to rewind western civilization to before the Age of Enlightenment (I'd say the reformation, except most of these are ultra-fanatical protestants, so that wouldn't work), and in so doing, destroy or convert anyone who does not share their particular flavor of ideology.</blockquote>
