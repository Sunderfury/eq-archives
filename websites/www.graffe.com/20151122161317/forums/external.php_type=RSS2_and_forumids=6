			Congress is expected to enact a new law that would allow the U.S. government to revoke passports from Americans who owe the IRS over $50,000.<br />
<br />
Under a provision buried within the 864-page highway-funding bill, H.R. 22, the State Department would have the authority to revoke or deny passports of Americans owing the IRS more than $50,000 in &quot;seriously delinquent&quot; federal taxes, including interest and penalties, which would be adjusted for inflation, reported The Wall Street Journal.<br />
<br />
The passport provision would usually only apply to people who have had a levy or lien filed against them by the IRS. Those who have already arranged a payment plan or are legally disputing a tax case would not likely be subject to the rule, according to CNN.<br />
<br />
The State Department could issue a passport in the case of a &quot;humanitarian&quot; emergency, but neither the State Department or the Treasury Department would elaborate while the legislation is pending, the WSJ said.<br />
<br />
The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the measure would bring in $398 million over the next decade.<br />
<br />
The highway-funding bill is currently before a conference committee and is expected to be passed in early December and take effect on Jan. 1.<br />
<br />
Critics of the measure claim there will be no judicial review and no due process if the passport revocation rule retains its current form.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't get to go in front of a judge first to have a fair and impartial hearing over whether or not the government's tax allegations are accurate. The language in the law is very clear: they can simply revoke your passport if you owe them money in their sole discretion,&quot; according to Soverign Man's Simon Black.<br />
<br />
Some of the most vulnerable to the provision are the nearly 8 million Americans who live abroad and need their passports for work visas, banking, and residency permits, and may not even be receiving tax notices from the IRS.<br />
<br />
Charles Bruce, a lawyer who advises the expatriate group American Citizens Abroad, highlighted a report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that found that the IRS sent 855,000 notices to U.S. citizens living abroad in 2014, but the tax agency's &quot;data systems aren't designed to accommodate the different styles of international addresses, which can cause notices to be undeliverable.&quot; The report added that &quot;current IRS processes for addressing international mail issues are ineffective or nonexistent.&quot;<br />
<br />
American Citizens Abroad wrote a letter to Congress earlier this month requesting a temporary stop on the passport revocation measure until hearings are held discussing implications that may arise, according to The Daily Caller.

			The Israeli government is considering filing a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization against the European Union, in response to the latter’s decision to mark Israeli products originating in the settlements at retail chains in Europe. A senior Israeli official told Ha’aretz that the push for a suit comes from Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan and Minister of Justice Ayelet Shaked. The move is opposed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Economy.<br />
<br />
Shaked and Erdan met recently to coordinate the promotion of their move in the cabinet. According to Ha’aretz, the two agreed on hiring a major international legal firm specializing in international trade to make a recommendation regarding the feasibility of a WTO suit and the chances of success.<br />
<br />
According to Ha’aretz, senior officials in the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of the Economy say that chances for the success of such a move against the EU are very low and may cause more harm than good. They argue the move could cause a counter-mobilization of Arab countries against Israel at the WTO, and to end up with a decision making the products from the settlements illegal according to international law, which would mean they must be seized, not only labeled. A Foreign Ministry official said the move was one of those things that you “know how to get into, but not how to get out.”<br />
<br />
International law professors Avi Bell of Bar Ilan University and Eugene Kontorovich of Northwestern University have written a position paper urging the filing of a lawsuit against the EU, and met with Shaked and Arden. Both have argued that one of the main principles of the WTO is no discrimination between member countries. Bell and Kontorovich say the EU decided to select products from the settlements for labeling, but isn’t labeling products from other conflict areas in the world where there is an occupation or a territorial dispute, such as the Moroccan Sahara products or products from the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, it has been reported that cosmetics company Ahava has manages to get around the labeling for the time being, arguing that although its main factory is located at Kibbutz Mitzpe Shalem in Judea, most of the raw materials come from the parts of the Dead Sea that are within 1949 Israel; also, it argues that not all its products are manufactured in that main factory.

			Princeton University's president, under pressure from African American student activists, said Thursday night that the school would begin a process to consider expunging the legacy of former President Woodrow Wilson from campus. <br />
<br />
The agreement - signed by Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber - ended a 32-hour sit-in at the president's office. <br />
<br />
Students with the Black Justice League entered Nassau Hall around noon Wednesday, calling for the Ivy League university to acknowledge racism within Wilson's legacy and take actions to improve cultural sensitivity on campus. <br />
<br />
The agreement comes as black students across the country have been rallying for improved race relations on college campuses, including a national day of protest Wednesday under the hashtag #StudentBlackOut. <br />
<br />
Wilson, a Southern Democrat who served as Princeton's president from 1902-1910, allowed his cabinet to re-segregate federal government departments and also forced civil servant applicants to include photographs, considered by African Americans at the time as a move to weed them out. <br />
<br />
&quot;We appreciate the willingness of the students to work with us to find a way forward for them, for us and for our community,&quot; Eisgruber said. &quot;We were able to assure them that their concerns would be raised and considered through appropriate processes.&quot; <br />
<br />
Eisgruber and two other Princeton leaders, Dean Jill Dolan and Vice President for Campus Life Rochelle Calhoun, agreed to a number of actions including a request to Princeton's board of trustees about removing Wilson's name from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, as well as to survey students about removing the name. <br />
<br />
The university leaders also agreed to initiate a request for the removal of a mural of Wilson from a school dining hall, to enhance cultural sensitivity training for faculty and to establish rooms on campus for &quot;cultural affinity groups.&quot; <br />
<br />
The students also secured immunity for those who occupied the president's office. <br />
<br />
Following news of the agreement, the university notified students via email that a &quot;non-specific bomb and firearm threat&quot; had been made in reference to the student protest.

			SOFIA/WARSAW - A bomb threat that turned out to be a hoax, made by a &quot;joking&quot; Polish passenger, forced an airliner flying from Warsaw to Egypt to make an emergency landing in Bulgaria on Thursday.<br />
<br />
The Airbus A320 of Polish Small Planet Airlines landed just before dawn in the Black Sea city of Burgas, where authorities said all 161 passengers and crew were evacuated safely.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no explosive device on board the airplane that made an emergency landing,&quot; the interior ministry said in a statement after conducting a second check of the plane.<br />
<br />
Prosecutors said a 67-year-old Pole had alerted crew about a possible bomb on board. He has been arrested and could face up to 15 years in jail.<br />
<br />
Earlier on Thursday the Polish airline said in a statement that the man had &quot;informed the cabin crew about the explosive he might be carrying. (He) ... later admitted it was a joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
A police spokeswoman said the passenger admitted having consumed alcohol.<br />
<br />
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boiko Borisov praised the security forces' reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;You saw how quickly our forces in Burgas acted after an absolutely false signal,&quot; he said. &quot;Such a big concern because of a drunken Pole ... but still it was a kind of training.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bulgaria has tightened controls at borders and airports since Friday's attacks in Paris in which 129 people died.<br />
<br />
The charter flight had been en route to the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Small Planet Airlines sent another aircraft to Burgas to enable passengers to complete their journey.

			In 2007, Stephanie Lenz uploaded to YouTube a 29-second video of her two small children parading around her kitchen to Prince&#8217;s song &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go Crazy.&#8221; It was quintessentially cute from the start and got cuter still along the way, especially when the mom asked her 13-month old son &#8220;what do you think of the music?,&#8221; which prompted him to bob up and down with joy on his little push toy. The video was an instant hit and still is, with over 1.3 million views.<br />
<br />
But Universal Studios saw nothing cute about it. <br />
<br />
Responsible for enforcing Prince&#8217;s copyrights, Universal, like other companies, searches YouTube on a regular basis for just such videos. When it came across Lenz&#8217;s &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go Crazy,&#8221; the company&#8217;s lawyer sent a &#8220;takedown notification&#8221; to YouTube. And YouTube did indeed take it down.<br />
<br />
But on Monday, Lenz took down Universal, winning an important ruling from a federal appeals court that has the potential to make companies think twice, or at least think a little harder, before issuing the takedown notifications allowed by a section of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.<br />
<br />
After the video&#8217;s removal, Lenz sued the company, claiming it had misrepresented its takedown privileges permitted under that law. Specifically, her lawyers said, the company did not stop to consider whether Lenz&#8217;s video amounted to &#8220;fair use&#8221; of Prince&#8217;s song, in which case it would not have been a copyright infringement and not subject to summary takedown.<br />
<br />
The fair use principle is an aspect of copyright law that allows use of a copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching and research. Fair use is what allows a critic, for example, to quote passages from a book or a literary scholar to include parts of a poem in a research paper that happens to be about that poem. It&#8217;s what also permits a newspaper to quote portions of books that make news without getting permission from the publisher.<br />
<br />
The case is an important one for the entertainment and publishing industries, especially with the advent of the Internet and social media, where people routinely appropriate background music for their videos, adding their own little touches along the way.<br />
<br />
Or, as in Lenz&#8217;s case, where they show their children frolicking to some popular song.<br />
<br />
Monday, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held for Lenz, saying that when Universal issued its takedown notice &#8212; asserting with certainty that Lenz was violating Prince&#8217;s copyright &#8212; it did not not consider whether her video was a fair use. If indeed it was a fair use, the company could not have had it removed.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Universal faces liability if it knowingly misrepresented in the takedown notification that it had formed a good faith belief the video was not authorized by the law, i.e., did not constitute fair use,&#8221; wrote Judge Richard C. Tallman for the majority. &#8220;Here, Lenz presented evidence that Universal did not form any subjective belief about the video&#8217;s fair use &#8212; one way or another &#8212; because it failed to consider fair use at all, and knew that it failed to do so.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;To be clear,&#8221; the panel said, &#8220;if a copyright holder ignores or neglects our unequivocal holding that it must consider fair use before sending a takedown notification, it is liable for damages.&#8221;<br />
<br />
This is not the end of the case, however. To determine whether she&#8217;s entitled to damages, she&#8217;ll have to go back to a trial court and show that Universal knowingly misrepresented its &#8220;good faith&#8221; belief that it had the right under the law to issue the takedown notice.<br />
<br />
Still, the ruling is problematic for the industry for a variety of reasons. As the court pointed out, companies scan thousands, even millions, of Internet postings for copyright infringement using algorithms rather than humans. The more subjective judgment, whether, say, a portion of a movie playing in the background while someone&#8217;s kids are playing in the foreground, may require more human intervention. On the other hand, the court suggested that an algorithm that proved itself capable of making such a determination might be sufficient.<br />
<br />
Ars Technica saw that as an ominous sign. &#8220;The majority&#8217;s near-endorsement of mass takedown routines is telling&#8221; and is &#8220;unlikely to change much about the millions of takedown notices now being sent each year to internet intermediaries.&#8221;<br />
<br />
A spokesman for the Recording Industry Association of America issued a statement on behalf of Universal: &#8220;We respectfully disagree with the court&#8217;s conclusion about the DMCA and the burden the court places upon copyright holders before sending takedown notices. But we are pleased that the Ninth Circuit made it clear that a court may not second guess a copyright owner&#8217;s good faith belief that the fair use does not excuse infringing conduct.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;I am hopeful we will have fewer improper takedown orders,&#8221; Corynne McSherry, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which represented Lenz, told the Los Angeles Times. &#8220;Copyright holders now are on notice they have to be more careful.&#8221;<br />
<br />
What does the ruling mean for the average YouTuber? It&#8217;s hard to tell. But reading its definition of &#8220;fair use,&#8221; taken directly from the law and the opinion, could provide some protective tips:<br />
<br />
It may be fair use when &#8220;for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include &#8212;<br />
<br />
<div style="margin-left:40px">(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;<br />
<br />
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;<br />
<br />
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and<br />
<br />
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</div><br />
Judge Milan D. Smith, Jr., concurred in part and dissented in part.<br />
<br />

This topic is rarely discussed here, but I don't mind hitting the third rail once in awhile, and I'd be interested in hearing some different perspectives about it.<br />

<b><font size="4">The Problem With Reincarnation</font></b><br />
<br />
In this post, I'd like to consider seriously the issue of reincarnation. Or perhaps I should say, the problem with reincarnation. Though I practice Buddhism, I don't actually believe in reincarnation. I suspect that my saying this will irk many of my Buddhist friends, who rightly consider the tenet of reincarnation central to Buddhism, as well as the indifference of anyone who doesn't believe in reincarnation and therefore has little interest in an essay that points out the problems with a theory they already discount. Though I therefore risk having an audience of no one, I think the discussion will be an interesting one, because the real question at the heart of reincarnation is one of identity.<br />
<br />
According to Wikipedia the percentage of people who believe in reincarnation ranges from 12 to 44% (link is external) depending on the country being surveyed (in the U.S. it's 20%). And, I freely admit, such a belief may not be wrong: psychiatrist Ian Stevenson has conducted more than 2,500 case studies over a period of 40 years of children who supposedly remembered past lives. He methodically documented each child's statements and then identified the deceased person the child identified with, and verified the facts of the deceased person's life that matched the child's memory. He also matched birthmarks and birth defects to wounds and scars on the deceased, verified by medical records such as autopsy photographs. While skeptics have argued his reports provide only anecdotal evidence, his data does seem to demand explanation.<br />
<br />
The problem with reincarnation as that explanation, however, is twofold: 1) we have, as of yet, no way to verify it prospectively in an objective manner, 2) we have no mechanism to explain how reincarnation might occur. Though reincarnation is indeed a central tenet of all sects of Buddhism, no sect of Buddhism posits the existence of a non-corporeal &quot;soul&quot;—an eternal, unchanging version of ourselves that's capable of living independently of a brain and a body. Rather, in Buddhism, the self is viewed as something that has no &quot;absolute&quot; existence, as something that changes constantly from moment to moment, as well as something that's capable of existing only within the confines of a physical brain.<br />
<br />
Yet something of us, Buddhism argues, continues from life to life, something that makes us uniquely us. The sect of Buddhism I practice argues this &quot;something&quot; is our karma: the sum of all the effects we ourselves have created within our lives (like unexploded mousetraps that will be triggered at some point in the future) as a result of all the things we've ever thought, said, and done—not just in the past of our current life, but in all the pasts of all our previous lives.<br />
<br />
And here is where I have a third problem with the Buddhist notion of reincarnation: how does the sum of all the effects I myself have created in the past add up to &quot;me&quot;? I can accept that all the things I've ever thought, said, and done (at least in this lifetime) have indeed, in some sense, created the person I am now. But do all my thoughts, words, and actions create my core essence—or arise from it?<br />
<br />
Which leads me to ask what I think, in one sense, is a more interesting question than the question of reincarnation: namely, what is my core essence? The sense of self I feel and have always felt has seemed constant throughout my life, which is why I feel as if I even have a core essence. But a moment's reflection reveals that what's really remained constant is the feeling of the sense of self itself, not the content of that sense. Am I even remotely the same person I was at five? At fifteen? Last week? A moment ago? In one sense, obviously yes. Something links the &quot;me&quot; that I am right now to the &quot;me&quot; that I was at five (and not, for example, to my wife as she was at five). But what is that something? My memory? I've long ago forgotten most of what happened to me at five. I remember being five, but not the entirety of even one day from that year (in fact, I don't remember the entirety of even one day from last week). If any content in my life remains constant, it's not due to my remembering it, to my consciously holding it fast in my working memory so as not to forget it and thus myself. It's because some things remain constant without my having to remember them or even think about them: essentially, my habits (which, are by definition, unconscious) and my beliefs (which, though they must be expressed in language, needn't be consciously apprehended to influence behavior). Given what we now know about the enormous size and power of the unconscious—about just how much of &quot;us&quot; lies beneath the surface of our conscious minds—we have to admit that the defining core of who we are may in fact be located mostly, if not entirely, beneath our awareness (our conscious minds being mostly spectators and interpreters of our unconscious selves).<br />
<br />
But what does even this mean? That our unconscious beliefs and habits define who we are? Does our conscious awareness, the values we're able to articulate to ourselves, have nothing to do with our identity? And what about our memories of who we've been? Without those, would not some essential part of the self be lost?<br />
<br />
Many Buddhists would argue the sense that we even have a self is an illusion, that despite our feeling that a unique something lies at the core of what we are, such a something doesn't, in fact, exist. And though I can't answer any of the questions above, I find myself sympathetic to this point of view. I suspect the only thing constant about us is our sense that something about us remains constant, and that who we are is comprised both of stable parts (personality, beliefs, attitudes, and so on) and unstable parts (retrievable memories, moods, interests, and so on)—and that to change any one of them (whether in the realm of the conscious or unconscious) is to change who we are in proportion to their relative stability (changing a belief, for example—like a belief in God—would represent a major change; changing a mood, on the other hand, merely a minor one).<br />
<br />
Certainly those of us who've gone through major upheaval in our lives or experienced an abrupt and enormous leap in maturity at some point often pause to look back and imagine ourselves as a fundamentally different person from who we once were. But perhaps our inclination to label ourselves as &quot;changed&quot; only when we notice a large enough difference between who we are and who we used to be ignores the truth that we're never not changing. Our lives are in constant motion, and to imagine that we could take a snapshot of them at any one point in time and somehow capture that which represents our essential selves strikes me as arguing that an actual snapshot of a flowing river represents its one true shape. So when people tell me they believe in reincarnation, the first question that comes to my mind isn't about what evidence they think argues for the possibility. Rather, it's this: just exactly what do they think gets reincarnated?<br />

</div>As for myself, I was raised devout Roman Catholic, drifted away at 18, am friendly with the term &quot;recovering Catholic&quot;  :p and remain pretty undecided and open-minded to everything from Atheism and Agnosticism to traditional Christianity and Eastern religions like the one discussed here.<br />
<br />
I guess what prompted me to post this thread was recently re-watching a television show on one of the History / Science / Discovery channels, which might be described by some as &quot;cheesy,&quot; (*shrugs* :p ) centered around a young boy that displayed frighteningly accurate information about a WWII pilot killed in action.  I make no claims as to its validity, but it was certainly interesting and apparently not so uncommon.<br />
<br />
Pretty cool perspectives from this blog imho, anyway.<br />

<b><font size="4">Decoding Daesh: Why is the new name for ISIS so hard to understand?</font></b><br />
By Alice Guthrie on 19/2/15<br />
<br />
<b>Arabic translator Alice Guthrie investigates 'Daesh', the new name for ISIS recently adopted by several world leaders because it delegitimises the group's activities. But how can a new name undermine a terrorist organisation? And why do the English-speaking media find the name so difficult to understand?</b><br />
<br />
Over the last few months, there has been a concerted effort by several senior global politicians to give a new name to the group known as ISIS, or Islamic State, IS or ISIL. That new name is ‘Daesh’. If you've followed coverage of this attempted official linguistic sea change, you'll have gathered that the new name, although it’s just an Arabic acronym equivalent to the English 'ISIS', apparently delegitimises the organisation, mocks them, and thus drives them to threaten taking violent retribution on anyone who uses it.<br />
<br />
But why does this acronym have this power, and what's so offensive about it? If your access to news media is only in English, you might still be none the wiser. You may have got the impression from this coverage that the exact meaning and connotations of the word cannot quite be fathomed by anyone – that this word is a nebulous drifter, never to be pinned down. Basically, the coverage seems to imply, it’s obscured by a veil, like so much else in the Arabo-Islamic world, and we can’t hope to get it spelled out for us. It’s far too Eastern and weird for that.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm an Arabic translator, so my work revolves around pinning down and spelling out Arabic words and explaining them in English, and I’m here to let you know that there’s nothing mysterious about this new acronym: it may be from a language quite different to English, and an Eastern one at that, but trust me: it can be explained.<br />
<br />
I’ve come across some wildly inaccurate blethering lately about the word’s significance and its signification: even if you don’t know any Arabic at all, you might have been surprised to read in your major liberal broadsheet that although this new name is a transliteration of the Arabic acronym equivalent to ISIS, there are ‘certain schools of thought’ as to what the name means, or that you are being offered analysis based on ‘rough translations’ of the words in the acronym. If you’re particularly observant, you may have asked yourself how one of the words in the Arabic acronym of 'Islamic State' in Iraq and Syria can also mean ‘to crush or trample underfoot’ (as a major UK broadsheet faithfully ‘explained’ recently) – perhaps pondering, over your cornflakes, which of the words is the one with this double meaning: ‘state’ or ‘Islamic’, ‘Iraq’ or ‘Syria’? And wondering why you haven’t ever heard tell of this strange phenomenon before? If you’re a linguist, you will have scoffed at repeated references to a word that seems to shift between being a noun and a verb according to how it’s ‘conjugated’, taking extravagant semiotic leaps along the way. Perhaps, getting the impression from all this that the Arabic language is such uncharted territory, you even got inspired to start learning it, and get stuck in at the East-West decoding coalface? Is this ringing any Orientalist bells? But it’s really not that complicated, and certainly not uncharted territory at all.<br />
<br />
The main misapprehensions about the word currently circulating in our media boil down to the following list:<br />
<br />
That daesh is an Arabic word in its own right (rather than an acronym) meaning ‘a group of bigots who impose their will on others’<br />
That it can be ‘differently conjugated’ to mean either the phrase above or ‘to trample and crush’<br />
That one of the words in the acronym also means ‘to trample or crush’<br />
That it is an insult or swearword in its own right<br />
That is has different meanings in the plural form<br />
Read around a bit, across several UK and US broadsheets, and you will quickly spot the same misinformation being repeated almost word for word: publications are either quoting each other as supposed reliable sources on the story, with acknowledgments, or simply repeating each other’s lines without explicitly referencing them. In most cases, the explanation is not only wrong, it doesn’t actually make sense. But why all this speculation? Why so much mystery? Why are phrases like ‘rough translation’ and ‘possibly linked to this word’ being used, making the story out to be as elusive and contested as many of the political developments on the ground in Syria? Clearly none of these journalists or their researchers have accessed an Arabic/English dictionary (there are many freely searchable online) nor – even easier – contacted an arabophone, to check these basic facts.<br />
<br />
So what does Daesh really mean? Well, D.A.E.SH is a transliteration of the Arabic acronym formed of the same words that make up I.S.I.S in English: 'Islamic State in Iraq and Syria', or '&#1604;&#1583;&#1608;&#1604;&#1577; &#1575;&#1604;&#1573;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;&#1610;&#1577; &#1601;&#1610; &#1575;&#1604;&#1593;&#1585;&#1575;&#1602; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1588;&#1575;&#1605;' ('al-dowla al-islaamiyya fii-il-i’raaq wa-ash-shaam'). That’s the full name chosen by the organisation, and – when used in full – it’s definitely how they want to be referred to. In Arabic, just like in English, that phrase consists of six words, four of which make it into the acronym (‘in’ and ‘and’ are omitted) : '&#1583;&#1608;&#1604;&#1577; dowla' (state) + '&#1573;&#1587;&#1604;&#1575;&#1605;&#1610;&#1577; islaamiyya' (Islamic) + '&#1593;&#1585;&#1575;&#1602; i’raaq' (Iraq) + '&#1588;&#1575;&#1605; shaam'. That last word, 'shaam', is variously used in Arabic to denote Damascus (in Syrian dialect) ‘Greater Syria’ / the Levant, or Syria – hence the US-preferred acronym ISIL, with the L standing for Levant. In Arabic there is a single letter for the sound 'sh', hence our transliteration of the acronym having five letters, not four. And the vowel which begins the word 'islaamiyya' becomes an 'a' sound when differently positioned in a word, hence the acronym being pronounced 'da’ish' when written in Arabic, and the 'a' coming over into our transliteration of the acronym. Of course the amazing Arabic letter '&#1593;' which begins the word for 'Iraq' is unpronounceable to an anglophone, and can’t be written in Latin letters, hence the use of an 'e' (or occasionally an ’e) in the transliteration.<br />
<br />
Still with me? Nothing mysterious there – or nothing that anyone who speaks Arabic wouldn’t be able to explain. It’s not a previously existing word in its own right. It does indeed now mean ‘tyrannical, despotic, murdering fundamentalists who claim to be Islamic and claim to be a state’ but only as a result of how it sounds (more on that in a minute) and as a result of the associations that quickly attach to a neologism, in the same way that they have attached to the word ISIS. So it’s not based on any previous – or mysterious, or quasi-mystical Eastern – meaning.<br />
<br />
And so if the word is basically 'ISIS', but in Arabic, why are the people it describes in such a fury about it? Because they hear it, quite rightly, as a challenge to their legitimacy: a dismissal of their aspirations to define Islamic practice, to be 'a state for all Muslims’ and – crucially – as a refusal to acknowledge and address them as such. They want to be addressed as exactly what they claim to be, by people so in awe of them that they use the pompous, long and delusional name created by the group, not some funny-sounding made-up word. And here is the very simple key point that has been overlooked in all the anglophone press coverage I’ve seen: in Arabic, acronyms are not anything like as widely used as they are in English, and so arabophones are not as used to hearing them as anglophones are. Thus, the creation and use of a title that stands out as a nonsense neologism for an organisation like this one is inherently funny, disrespectful, and ultimately threatening of the organisation’s status. Khaled al-Haj Salih, the Syrian activist who coined the term back in 2013, says that initially even many of his fellow activists, resisting Daesh alongside him, were shocked by the idea of an Arabic acronym, and he had to justify it to them by referencing the tradition of acronyms being used as names by Palestinian organisations (such as Fatah). So saturated in acronyms are we in English that we struggle to imagine this, but it’s true.<br />
<br />
All of this means that the name lends itself well to satire, and for the arabophones trying to resist Daesh, humour and satire are essential weapons in their nightmarish struggle. But the satirical weight of the word as a weapon, in the hands of the Syrian activists who have hewn it from the rock of their nightmare reality, does not just consist of the weirdness of acronyms. As well as being an acronym, it is also only one letter different from the word 'daes &#1583;&#1575;&#1593;&#1587;' , meaning someone or something that crushes or tramples. Of course that doesn’t mean, as many articles have claimed, that 'daesh' is 'another conjugation' of the verb ‘to crush or trample’, nor that that is 'a rough translation of one of the words in the acronym' – it’s simply one letter different from this other word. Imagine if the acronym of 'Islamic State in Iraq and Syria' spelt out ‘S.H.I.D’ in English: activists and critics would certainly seize the opportunity to refer to the organisation as ‘shit’ – but I think it’s safe to say that no serious foreign media outlet would claim that 'shit' was another conjugation of the verb 'shid', nor a rough translation of it. Of course, that analogy is an unfair one, given the hegemonic global linguistic position of English, not to mention the heightened currency of scatological words; but there is a serious point to be made here about the anglophone media’s tendency to give up before it’s begun understanding non-European languages.<br />
<br />
And obviously understanding things outside of English, and explaining them to each other via our (social)media hive mind is hugely important on many levels: in the broadest sense, it allows us to attempt to take our place as global citizens, and feeds our connection to other humans on planet Earth. Sadly, the story of the word 'Daesh' is neither the only nor even the worst example of anglophone media failing us in this regard. But there’s something specifically important in this particular story which is being overlooked as a result of all the lazy journalism around it: the use of this word is part of a multi-pronged, diverse range of efforts by Arabs and Muslims to reject the terrorists’ linguistic posturing, their pseudo-classical use of Arabic, their claims to Quranic authority and an absolute foundation in sacred scripture, as reflected in their pompous name. This ridiculous claim has of course been masterfully and witheringly deconstructed at the Islamic level, but at the secular level, satire is a crucial weapon in the fight against these maniacs: there is a fertile tradition of Syrian and satire as not only defiance but coping strategy, and which has been quite under-reported. In satirical Arabic media (and conversation) various diminutives of the word have also gone viral – elegantly diminishing their subject, belittling them, patronising and relegating them to a zone beyond any formal naming in a single sweep.<br />
<br />
Whether the word Daesh is insulting to its subject because it sounds ridiculous, or because it actually sounds sinister, depends slightly on who you ask. Some Syrians I’ve talked to rate the satirical value of the word very highly; for others, such as al-Haj Salih himself, however, the main weight of the word is not around humour, but around two very serious points he and others make. First of these is that both the shape of the word and the combination of letters in it are redolent of words from al-jahaliyya, the pre-Islamic dark ages or ‘age of ignorance’ that – as well as being a time rich in poetry and narrative heritage – has huge connotations of hideous barbarity in the popular imagination, being the realm of jinns and monsters and evil spirits and marauding freaks. This has also been overlooked in anglophone coverage, or been confused with an idea of the word having a previous set meaning in and of itself: as we know, it doesn’t. But given the connotations of this type of word, it sounds (to many an arabophone ear) very clearly like it must denote some crazed, bloodthirsty avatar belching back out from the guts of history. As al-Haj Salih very gently and firmly expresses to me by phone when I interview him for this piece, 'If an organisation wants to call itself ‘the light’, but in fact they are ‘the darkness’, would you comply and call them ‘the light’?' The second, and equally important, point that al-Haj Salih stresses to me is another take on why a neologism is insulting: it’s an obviously fictitious name, for an obviously fictional concept. Once again, the movement’s claim to legitimacy as a state and to rule is being rejected as nonsense, reflected in a fabricated nonsense name for them.<br />
<br />
So the insult picked up on by Daesh is not just that the name makes them sound little, silly, and powerless, but that it implies they are monsters, and that they are made-up.<br />
<br />
All of this is why some Syrian activists therefore see it as so important that use of the word 'Daesh' spreads, and have been working hard to make that happen – so effectively in fact, as we know, that the word has been taken on by several global heads of state and their associated media, who have a limited grasp of the specifics behind the term. Originally hailing from the city of Raqqa, Daesh’s current Syrian headquarters, al-Haj Salih says his main goal in making a new name for Daesh was to avoid people getting used to referring to a tyrannical and despotic movement as a ‘state’. Although he regretted his efforts when the word was used by Assad, and although he was the victim of death threats and assassination attempts in Raqqa (he is now based abroad), on the whole he has been pleased to see the word widely adopted by the Arabic media since summer 2013. In terms of its use by global heads of state and media, he feels that this is only natural, and right, as ‘The people who suffer most at the hands of Daesh should decide what they are called’.<br />
<br />
There is surely an interesting parallel between the refusal to use the name Daesh prefer, and our anglophone media’s misreading of the word itself – every article that recycles the same confused notions about the word denies the concrete meaning of Arabic, and relegates it to being a fluid and shifting language, inherently unintelligible.<br />
<br />
It was noted in the Arabic press that the Spanish Secretary of State for Security, Francisco Martínez, correctly explained the link between the words 'daesh' and 'daes' in November when he made a speech requesting that Spanish media adopt the new term, and it’s easy enough to find that explanation in the mainstream Spanish press. Although the French media is not entirely free of confusion around the word’s meaning and origins – with some press articles clearly based on the same misreading of one or two sources as their anglophone counterparts are, or throwing in bizarre new angles such as that 'Daesh' is pejorative 'in Lebanon'  – the crucial difference is that a quick search reveals articles in major French broadsheets that explain it without any problems. If other dominant European languages can get it right in their media, why can’t the anglophone media manage this little linguistic research task? Do we really live up to our stereotype of monolingual insularity this much, even at major broadsheet fact-checking level?<br />
<br />
It seems there might actually be a systemic unwillingness to explain, on the part of the mainstream anglophone media – or, at best, an assumption that these things will not be explicable. How else can one interpret this total disregard that has been shown for the easy research avenues available to anyone setting out to investigate the story of a name? There is a vast community of bilingual arabophone people in the anglophone world, not to mention all the academics and people like me with a good acquired command of Arabic, very easily found and contacted. Even if that somehow proved too difficult, what about all the resourceful tech-savvy young researchers capable of, well, copy-pasting words into an online dictionary? More worryingly, this cannot fail to raise questions about the attitude to ‘them’ all this might reflect: is there something uniquely challenging for our media about Arabs and Muslims? Would we accept this kind of journalistic linguistic fog about, say, Greece? Have you heard that Syriza is a ‘rough translation’ of a Greek verb meaning ‘to wrest back power from a neoliberal global economic conspiracy of elite cronyism and structural inequality, and start a programme of radical resource redistribution and social justice, while wondering whether you will soon be ousted by a CIA-sponsored coup’? Well, just take my word for it, it is.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Watched this film, thought it was good. I am curious though, is the film representative of how parents of teens behave nowadays? <br />
<br />
It's difficult to summarize but the main one I am curious about is that one of the parents has gone all out NSA on their child and promoting that to other parents (in their weird parent meetup group that's not exactly a social event nor required event) do the same. Is that a common parent thing to do nowadays? <br />
<br />
The parent in question monitors all of the child's electronic communications, actively bugs the child's bedroom and computing and communications equipment, and directly interferes with communications (deleting texts received from peers, deleting facebook messages). <br />
<br />
And the parent has the same ideas about pop culture that existed in the past except with pen and paper games instead of MMORPGs.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qSDMSYx.png" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
It had not occurred to me that kids already enrolled in college nowadays have no first hand memory of 9/11 happening and simply presume the security theater escalation and high level misdirection is the way it has always been until I was watching the movie and the kids in the classroom are given learn about 9/11 as a school assignment. <br />
<br />
That's such a keystone event in modern history on par with the 1948 Arab-Israeli War that I have no idea how kids nowadays can make any sense of things based on the context that they have gathered in upwards of 20 or so years. <br />
<br />
It has to be immensely absurd without that experience. What is more chilling to me though is that having grown up in an environment where things were always this way they most likely will never consider that it can be any other way.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So most of the black Friday ads are out now.  But unlike previous years where at least some of the ads were still for Friday (or separate ads for each day), they are nearly all for Thursday now, with nothing for Friday at all.<br />
<br />
I don't understand the shift to Thursday.  Most of the articles I've read from past years say it's not worth the cost, some companies even lose money making the change.<br />
<br />
I refuse to shop on Thanksgiving.  Besides the fact my day is already packed with two different family events, it's a rude practice and I do not need to save $50 bad enough to ditch my family whey they drove specifically to see me.<br />
<br />
On the flip side there's very few deals even worth doing it.  Like every year there's a couple good TV deals, but all the wife really wants is an xbox one and nearly every deal except DELL's you can already get online right now.<br />
<br />
I was never really a black Friday shopper to begin with, but it just seems like a useless over hyped event at this point.  Want to guess how many people will be trampled this year?  Not enough, that's how many.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Check this out if you haven't. It's a half-hour comedic drama with great writing and a fantastic cast. I love the butch(?) lesbian on the show. We are on the same page when it comes to date ideas. I love when she points out all the stupid shit the guys are doing trying to hustle up some women. The show is an excellent change of pace from the usual romantic tropes.<br />
<br />
Great season finale also, can't wait for the next season. There is a lot of great storylines in season one alone and the half-hour goes by fast. It might be my favorite show of the year.</div>

			With the help of 20 years’ worth of research and thousands of prehistoric shards of pottery, a large group of scientists have presented evidence that the deep relationship between humans and honeybees is far older than we thought — giving us just one more reason to care about the conservation of a species that we’ve relied on for thousands of years.<br />
<br />
Honeybees are a cornerstone of modern agriculture, valued both for their importance as pollinators and for the honey and wax they produce. Today, they’re considered a largely domesticated organism, commonly kept by humans in managed hives — but it wasn’t always this way. Like all domesticated creatures, honeybees  started out as wild animals. <br />
<br />
In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, a group of researchers find that the relationship between humans and honeybees goes back all the way to the Neolithic age, starting around 8,000 years ago. They figured this out by analyzing residue found in Neolithic pottery from Europe, the Middle East and North Africa to see if beeswax was present. Finding beeswax residue in pottery suggests that humans were exploiting bees to use their wax (and probably their honey, too).<br />
<br />
The paper includes pottery analyses from two decades of archaeological studies, said Melanie Roffet-Salque, a postdoctoral researcher specializing in archaeological chemistry at the University of Bristol and the paper’s lead author. These many years of research were largely led by Richard Evershed, a professor of biogeochemistry at the University of Bristol.<br />
<br />
The purpose of the research varied over the decades — sometimes the scientists would be focusing on finding other types of residues, such as milk — but they would always document any other substances they found on a potsherd, including beeswax. Eventually, they decided to take a look at all the accumulated years of beeswax evidence and see what kind of insights could be gleaned.<br />
<br />
“Sometimes in papers we would report one single evidence for beeswax in a site, which is fine — but then we thought thought it would be fine to collate everything together and just write a paper,” Roffet-Salque said.<br />
<br />
The researchers found beeswax in Neolithic pottery throughout Europe, in the Near East and in a small corner of North Africa. The oldest evidence comes from Anatolia, or Asia Minor, dating back to the seventh millennium BC. There was also abundant evidence in the Balkan peninsula, in parts of Central and Western Europe and in the corner of North Africa now occupied by Algeria. The pottery in question ranged from the seventh millennium to the third millennium BC.<br />
<br />
The indication that humans and honeybees have been associated for so long is not particularly surprising, said Mark Winston, a professor of apiculture and social insects at Simon Fraser University, who was not involved with the paper. But, he added, “it does demonstrate the close relationship that humans have had with honeybees for many thousands of years and suggests that the current crisis of honeybees is one that we should take very seriously, because it interferes with that close symbiotic relationship.”<br />
<br />
The honeybee has been a subject of concern for decades, now, thanks to mysterious widespread die-offs, the causes of which scientists are only beginning to understand. While disease and parasites have likely played a major role in the decline of the honeybee, human influence — including habitat destruction and pesticide use — are also thought to have been major contributors.<br />
<br />
But because of bees’ profound importance to modern agriculture, the public has largely rallied around efforts to preserve the species, and the White House even released a National Strategy to Preserve the Health of Honeybees and Other Pollinators earlier this year.<br />
<br />
Now, learning more about how long and pervasive the history of human reliance on the honeybee has been could provide even greater motivation for people to make sure that relationship continues to last.<br />
<br />
The paper also provides insight into the honeybee’s historic range, which has been poorly understood until now. <br />
<br />
“Honeybees have been quite invisible throughout the archaeological record because they’re so tiny and disappear very quickly,” Roffet-Salque said. But the pottery evidence shows clearly where honeybees existed during the Neolithic age — and it also provides some evidence as to where they didn’t.<br />
<br />
The researchers failed to find any beeswax in areas of Europe above the 57th parallel, which would include Scotland, parts of northern Scandinavia, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Because bee exploitation seemed to exist in other parts of Europe during the same time period, the most logical explanation is that bees simply didn’t occupy these northern areas.<br />
<br />
These results suggest that the 57th parallel represented “the natural ecological limit for bees at the time,” Roffet-Salque said. Since modern-day honeybees can now be found in areas above that line, this evidence suggests that bees have adjusted their historic range over the last 10,000 years, likely in response to climatic changes.<br />
<br />
“This information could prove very useful in understanding how climate change will affect populations of honey bees,” said Gene Robinson, director of the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology and the Illinois Bee Research Facility at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in an e-mail to The Post. (Robinson also was not involved with the paper). “We already know that warming temperatures are shrinking the ranges of closely related bumble bee species in Europe and North America.”<br />
<br />
But Winston says these results are not particularly surprising, either. “As climate changes, we should expect organisms like bees to increase in some places and decrease in others,” he said. But being aware of the potential for these climate-related changes is useful, as these shifts can have “major implications in some places for how agriculture is conducted,” he added.<br />
<br />
At the very least, the paper offers fresh insight into poorly understood aspects of the honeybee’s history and introduces a novel, albeit time-consuming, method of investigating these questions. And given the honeybee’s importance to modern agriculture and close association with human culture, the study can be considered an intriguing look back into both man and insect’s early history. <br />
<br />
According to Robinson, it’s “an exciting new European biogeographical narrative for the most beneficial insect on the planet.”
