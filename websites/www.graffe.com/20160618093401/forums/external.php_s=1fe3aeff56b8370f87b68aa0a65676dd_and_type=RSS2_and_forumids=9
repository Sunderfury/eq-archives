			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Black mom at zoo loses track of her toddler for 2 seconds, toddler gets into a gorilla pen. Gorilla is shot.  Black woman's entire family is pilloried, people start in on the dad who wasn't even there, CPS gets involved.  Suggestions are made that the gorilla's life was worth preserving, not the kid's life.<br />
<br />
White dad at Disney wades in with his kid where he's not supposed to be, kid gets killed by an alligator.  Four alligators are disposed of.  Huge outpouring of sympathy and support for the upper middle class white family whose kid was killed because he was taken somewhere he never should have been.<br />
<br />
Check your own FB activity, it's all right there.  And just so the point is made because someone out there is a shithead, I feel terribly for the family and the dad is known to me through some mutual business activity.  I hurt for them.  But we live in one fucked up society where one parent is repeatedly kicked while she's down and another is offered almost universal comfort and support.<br />
<br />
So yes it's there, even if you don't hear it spoken or aren't trying to be a bigot yourself. It's baked right into the cultural pie.</div>
