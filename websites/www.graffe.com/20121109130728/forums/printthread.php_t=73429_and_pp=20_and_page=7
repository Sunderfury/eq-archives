As for this one, she didn't really say much about the Charlie/Nate aspect, or really if she liked the show or not, so I don't have much of an answer.

The presence of an internet bothered me a little as well, and I appreciate Branaman's idea that &quot;it&quot; might be referring to something else. I sincerely hope that is true, but I don't think it is. Sending super secret messages every time the militia is in town seems like a colossally stupid idea. Eventually a militia leader is going to walk in on someone doing that, and no one will be surprised.<br />

</div>If we can presume that power is possible, at least a low amount of it, I am not too bothered by the existence of a communication network as you can set up radio based communications pretty easily and reach large distances with the right set up.  Amateur radio is pretty fun, highly recommend it.  It's  great emergency skill and not all that expensive to get into.  There's probably a local group in your area if you are in the US.  You don't need any super exotic electronics either.</blockquote>

			<div class="message">Of course you can, but can you mass produce them to the precision needed to keep automatic weapons from jamming up? Heck, there's actually an ammunition factory really close to where they are in Joliet. Of course, none of the assembly lines will work for it. It's already been established that these weapons still exist, they just aren't going to be used by your average joe. Muskets are crude and fashioning bullets for them is simple.</div>

</div>It depends on how you define mass produce.  Hornady Lock n' Load AP will let you load 500 rounds per hour.  I have a lower end system and my ammo works just fine in a semi auto rifle. <br />
<br />
As an average reloader I reload .308 .40 and .45 and I have enough powder, primers and bullets for a few thousand rounds easily sitting on my shelf.  As long as you keep your brass it doesn't cost that much to do.  I imagine someone who actually stockpiles the materials would have enough for tens of thousands of rounds easily. <br />

What really interested me was what happened in those 15 years.  The chaos, the restructering, the rebuilding, the power struggles etc.   In my opinion, they skipped the most interesting stuff that flashbacks just aren't going to be enough to cover.</blockquote>

			Dies The Fire takes place in post-apocalyptic Oregon, in a time when an unknown phenomenon permanently disables all forms of modern technology, electricity, and combustion, including computers, electronics, guns, car and jet engines, and batteries. People are forced to adapt to a world without technology, and rely on swords and crossbows for protection. Many people starve, while others rob, rape, and pillage. Many even turn to cannibalism. Due to the collapse of public order, some band together, forming small farming communities on the outskirts of cities, while urban areas fall to sword-wielding warlords.

</div>That makes perfect sense though. Of course an oppressive power would restrict the means of the populace to fight back. They definitely are going with an American Revolution motif though, which I have mixed feelings about. <br />
<br />
I actually wonder if they have multiple writers not communicating with each other, as they are doing a poor job demonstrating greys. In one scene you are shown a human and/or practical side to the militia, and then in the next they are the ultimate evil. Throw patriotism into the pot and I don't have much faith in that particular plot line.<br />
<br />
Although has anyone else noticed that the name of the show is &quot;evolution&quot; until the &quot;R&quot; light comes on? I wonder if there is going to be a secondary plot we haven't seen yet.</blockquote>

</div>I don't know, the way the series has developed it didn't seem logical for Carl to kill Shane. There wasn't a sense of conflict developing between them, in fact, it was probably the only &quot;good&quot; relationship Shane had. Rick killing Shane was just the inevitable conclusion to the deterioration of their relationship since the beginning of the series.</blockquote>
