			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Well, one MUD in particular: <a href="http://www.achaea.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands</a><br />
<br />
As one of the oldest MUDs out there it has a lot of history behind it, and the mechanics of gameplay are relatively smooth; it is still a MUD though, so of course some things are still a bit onerous. That said, I'd been hurting for a really deep roleplay experience for a while, and Achaea certainly delivers.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to give it a look, be it known that the players keep things very in character; this isn't a game to hang out in and chat about OOC stuff. Feel free to get in touch with Knucker (me) in game; I'm in the Carnivalis Institute for Jestering.<br />
<br />
Edit: Well... yes. I'll see myself out, then?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>MMO-Champ summary: <a href="http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3030-Patch-5-1-Live-This-Week" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/...Live-This-Week</a><br />
<br />
Quick summary of new stuff:<br />
<br />
-item upgrades are in. 1500 JPs for 8 ilvls on blues, 750 VPs for each of two 4 ilvl jumps for purples. Guy is beside transmog guys in whatever cities have transmog guys. For PvP gear, same deal, only 1500 Honor / 750 x 2 Conquest<br />
<br />
-new war stuff in Krasarang. Rep vendors have ilvl 496 gear: rings at Honored, trinket, belt, boots at Revered, mount at Exalted. There's capturable world PvP objectives there. Alliance has their base NE of the turtle beach; Horde, the far SW of the zone, again on the beach. Three new associated scenarios.<br />
<br />
-all MoP rep vendors have the new faction account flag item on them: buy the item (requires Revered), use it, and all rep gains with that reputation for all characters on that account are doubled.<br />
<br />
-new quests with Wrathion. Warlocks get a long quest line.<br />
<br />
-Brawler's Guild is in game. Good luck winning an invitation on the Black Market Auction House (10 put up every day). Rep vendor has at least one pet on it.<br />
<br />
-a ton of pet updates. Journal is now 650 entries.<br />
<br />
-you can enter old raid instances without being in a raid. This is to help with part of the big pet update: many old raid bosses now drop pets.<br />
<br />
-lesser charms are currency, not items<br />
<br />
-tons of new glyphs, presumably on the trainer<br />
<br />
-new cooking bag on Nam Ironpaw, costs Ironpaw Tokens to buy<br />
<br />

World of Warcraft PTR Patch 5.1.0<br />
<br />
    General<br />
<br />
        The Pandaren Campaign begins!<br />
<br />
            The conflict between the Horde and the Alliance has ignited a new series of daily quests along the shore of the Krasarang Wilds.<br />
            Players can visit their faction strongholds in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms to begin the quest to summon their war fleets to the continent of Pandaria. (Alliance players that couldn't previously complete the starting quests can now speak with Taradormi at Lion's Landing to travel the timeways and experience those quests... BACK IN TIME).<br />
            Players will both valiantly defend their faction’s outpost and assault the opposing faction's headquarters.<br />
            Two new Reputations have been added: Alliance players can earn reputation with Operation: Shieldwall, while Horde players will curry favor with the Dominance Offensive.<br />
            Players can follow the story of the Pandaren Campaign through a series of special quests tied to their reputation with the landing forces. Heroes assisting with the war effort will join key characters and faction leaders as the growing conflagration spreads across Pandaria... as well as other locations around Azeroth.<br />
            Players can slay rival NPCs and opposing faction players along the shore to earn commissions that can be spent to upgrade their faction's base.<br />
            Look for strategic objectives to capture, including graveyards and towers. Commissions can be spent to recruit guards that will help protect this captured territory!<br />
            Players who are truly dedicated to their faction can spend their commissions on an item that will give their fellows an extra reputation group quest for the day. Horde players can speak with Ongrom Black Tooth, while Alliance players can contact Proveditor Grantley for details.<br />
<br />
        Brawler's Guild<br />
<br />
            Underground fighting rings have sprung up in Stormwind and Orgrimmar that will give brawlers who have their mitts on an invitation a chance to earn bragging rights by testing their solo PvE mettle against some of the toughest creatures found in World of Warcraft.<br />
            Players will prove their skill, and increase their rank with the Brawler's Guild, as they win matches against some of the most difficult solo encounters in World of Warcraft.<br />
            Entry into the brawler’s guild is by invitation only.  Invitations can be found on the black market auction house, by invitation from somebody within the guild, and occasionally as drops from certain Horde and Alliance NPCs.<br />
            As their Brawler's Guild rank increases, players will unlock additional rewards and activities within the Brawler’s Guild.<br />
            Brawlers on a realm will gather together into the blood spattered ring to watch as their peers face down their own opponents. They can watch the battles in progress to learn from hardened Brawler's Guild veterans as they wait for their own turn to fight.<br />
            If this is your first night at Brawler's Guild, you have to fight.<br />
<br />
        Lesser Charms of Good Fortune no longer take up bag space, and are now recorded in the currency tab of the Character Sheet.<br />

            A new passive ability has been added: Tooth and Claw. This ability causes autoattacks to have a chance to empower the Druid's next Maul. Empowered Mauls reduce the damage dealt by the target's next autoattack. Guardian Druids obtain this ability at level 32.<br />

                Rain of Fire no longer requires Immolate to be present to generate Burning Embers.<br />
                Rain of Fire's damage over time will now hit every 1 second, down from 2 seconds. The damage animation for the damage over time effect will no longer always display.<br />
            Removed the ranged Melee attack from Demonology Warlocks in Metamorphosis form, and increased the damage of Doom by 25% to compensate.<br />
            Conflagrate now generates Burning Embers.<br />
            Demonic Gateway's duration has been increased to 20 15 minutes, and it will no longer despawn if the Warlock moves too far away. In addition, this ability can no longer be used in any capital city.<br />
            Glyphs<br />
                A new Minor Glyph has been added: Glyph of Gateway Attunement. This glyph will cause a Warlock's Demonic Gateway to transport them immediately when they step on it.<br />
<br />
        Warrior<br />
<br />
            Avatar no longer grants immunity to movement impairing effects, and instead now instantly breaks movement impairing effects. This ability also no longer generates addiitonal Rage while active. Its duration has increased to 24 seconds (was 20 seconds).<br />

             <br />
<br />

             <br />
    Pet Battles<br />
<br />
        A new item has been introduced that can be used to upgrade the quality of Battle Pets: Battle-stones.<br />
            Battle-stones are available in two basic types, general purpose Battle-stones that can be used to upgrade the quality of any pet, and family specific Battle-stones, which can only be used to upgrade pets of a specific pet family. Pets over level 15 upgraded in this way can lose up to two levels in the process.<br />
            Battle-stones are available in two qualities: Flawless Battle-stones can upgrade pets directly to Rare quality, while Polished Battle-stones will upgrade a pet to Uncommon quality.<br />
            Players will have a very small chance to obtain a general purpose and family specific Flawless Battle-stone after winning a match against wild pets; defeating higher level opponents increases the chances of obtaining a stone. Family specific Flawless-Battlestones will be of the same family as the pets that were defeated. These valuable items are not soulbound, and can be sold on the Auction House.<br />
            Family specific Flawless Battle-stones can be found in the Sack of Pet Supplies obtained from performing Pet Trainer quests, and are Bind on Pickup.<br />
            General purpose Polished Battle-stones can be purchased for 1000 Justice Points.<br />
        Pet Journal<br />
            The quality of each pet is now visible in its slot in the Pet Journal.<br />
            Pets can now be filtered by name, type, rarity and level, and filters will remain in place each time the Pet Journal is viewed.<br />
            It is now possible to search locations in the Pet Journal. For example, searching “Westfall” will display all the Battle Pets that can be found in Westfall.<br />
        Pet Battle music is now more appropriate for the type of match being fought.<br />
        Several new Pet Battle PvP areas have been added to the world.<br />
        Several classic Raid bosses now have a chance to drop new Battle Pets. The new pets can be obtained from bosses in Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, Ahn'Qiraj, and Naxxramas.<br />
        Abilities that have been used will now continue to cool down for pets when they are not the active pet in a battle.<br />
        Right clicking a pet's portrait will now offer the option to look it up in the Pet Journal.<br />
        Players can now keep up to 650 pets.<br />
        Battle Pet tooltips will now display whether a pet is owned, and how many pets of that type are owned.<br />
        Pet Quality is now displayed in battles, and will be visible on portraits, names and tooltips.<br />
        The level of battle pets in a zone can now be seen on the map, and it’s now possible to see the strength of wild pets relative to your team at a glance.<br />
        Backline pets now display debuffs affecting them as well as the remaining duration of these effects.<br />
        The experience multiplier obtained by all seven Grand Master pet trainers in Pandaria has been increased to x5 from x3.5.<br />
        The experience multiplier obtained by defeating Pet Trainers Julia Stevens, Old Macdonald, Zunta, and Dagra the Fierce has been reduced to x2.5 from x3.5.<br />
        Macros have been added that allow for summoning random pets and random favorite pets.<br />
        The achievement Taming the World now awards the Safari Hat, which increases pet experience gained from Pet Battles by 10%.<br />
        Pets previously removed from the Safari achievements have been added back to the criteria of those achievements now that they're back in the wild.<br />
        The I Choose You achievement has been added for defeating Zen Master Aki. The reward for this achievement is 3000 gold.<br />
        Players that defeat Aki the Chosen at the culmination of the Battle Pet quest lines can now follow a new line of Battle Pet quests and associated daily quests that allows players to battle against Pandaren spirits.<br />
        A new Master Pet Tamer offering daily quests has been added to the Darkmoon Faire. Completing quests for the new trainer will offer the chance to acquire a new pet: the Darkmoon Eye.<br />
        The Dragon Kite can now be used in Pet Battles.<br />
        The Imperial Silkworm and Imperial Moth pets can now be created by Tailors.<br />
        A number of pets that could previously only be found accompanying other pets into battle can now be found roaming the world.<br />

    Sunsong Ranch<br />
<br />
        A new Seed has been added: Portal Shards<br />
            A mage who fell on hard times back in Dalaran has found a new home on Pandaria. Barnaby Fletcher will occasionally visit Halfhill Market to peddle a new type of seed – and take advantage of the Tillers’ hospitality.<br />
            Portal Shards grow into consumable items which can be used to open a portal from Sunsong Ranch to a major faction city.<br />
        Seeds now stack to 50.<br />
        Runty crops now have a spell visual to help call attention to themselves.<br />
        Growing crops now display the duration until the crop is ready to harvest.<br />
        Characters who have earned the “Friends on the Farm” achievement will no longer find gifts while harvesting Cooking Ingredient crops – instead, they have a chance to find special seeds such as Magebulb, Enigma Seed, Songbell, and more.<br />
         <br />
    Raids, Dungeons and Scenarios<br />
<br />
        Non-boss enemies in Mogu'shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, and Terrace of Endless Spring now respawn much more slowly.<br />
        Raid groups are no longer necessary to enter pre-Mists of Pandara raid dungeons. Enemies in these raids that previously required more than one player to defeat are now more easily dealt with by players battling alone.<br />

                    Domination Point<br />
                    Dagger in the Dark<br />
            Scenarios now include Dungeon Finder queue features, including leaders, backfill, vote to kick, and deserter debuffs. Roles are still not required.<br />
             <br />
    PvP<br />
        The growing conflict between the Horde and the Alliance has spilled across the face of Azeroth: level 90 players can now queue for Wintergrasp and Tol Barad via the PvP tab to battle one another in these epic conflicts.<br />
        Arena matches now have a 25 minute time limit (was 45 minutes).<br />
        Rated Battlegrounds now share the same spell restrictions as Arenas.<br />
         <br />

             <br />
    UI<br />
        Justice, Valor, Honor and Conquest Point quartermasters are now signified by new minimap icons.<br />
        A new banner will appear when a player is subjected to an effect that causes them to lose control of their character. The effect that caused the loss of control and remaining duration will be displayed. Configuration options are available in the “Combat” section of the “Interface Options&quot; menu.<br />
        A search bar has been added to the mount section of the Mount and Pet Journal.<br />
        The Mount and Pet Journal remembers which tab you were last using.<br />
         <br />
    Bug Fixes<br />
        Swooping Plainshawks no longer use abilities from the Bird of Prey Hunter pet family.<br />
        Fixed an issue that could cause crops to fail to appear when players entered Sunsong Ranch while several hundred yards up in the air.<br />
        Players who have learned the Terrible Turnip pet can now continue to find Ominous Seeds when harvesting Cooking Ingredient crops.<br />
        Classes<br />
            The responsiveness of many abilities and effects has been improved, including: Renewing Mist, Halo, Rogue Poisons, Revealing Strike, Rime, Killing Machine, Maelstrom Weapon, Sudden Doom, Ultimatum, Scent of Blood, Crimson Scourge, and Sudden Death.<br />

            Hunters<br />
                The snare provided by Ice Trap is now more responsive when enemies enter or leave the area of effect, and its effective area more closely matches the visual effect.<br />
                Lock and Load will now activate correctly when Ice Trap is triggered by an immune target, as long as a susceptible target is within the area of effect.<br />
                Fixed several issues involving Trap Mastery, Entrapment, Glyph of Black ice, and Glyph of Ice Trap.<br />
                The Growl pet ability will no longer cause diminishing returns against bosses that are immune to its effect.<br />
                Glyph of Black Ice now correctly benefits from the increased duration provided by Trap Mastery.<br />
