		<div>Gonna lay out some base info, then some suggestions (some stolen from another thread).  Gonna keep it simple btw.<br />
<br />
All numbers are based on parses I've done. (burst 8 min fight, low resists, wizard staunch recovery, glyphs etc)<br />
<br />
Wizards best DPS spells=instants   (yeah, they were nerfed, it's not gonna change back, not gonna talk about it)<br />
<br />
Wizard DPS increases based on:  AA's, Level, Gear<br />
<br />
For the purpose of this, i'm going to assume max DPS aa's done, and level 75.<br />
<br />
Raiding wizard gains a larger mana pool and better focus items over a grouping wizard.<br />
<br />
Focus increase from a 35% to 65% meaning a ~15% increase (from 18% to 33% average)<br />
<br />
Mana pool is still finite, just takes longer till you need to med.  <br />
<br />
Casual wizard average dps ~450,  raiding wizard ~650<br />
<br />
Burst dps casual wizard ~1600, raiding wizard ~2k (raiding wizard can do it a bit longer)<br />
<br />
Casual rogue average dps ~500, raiding rogue ~1200<br />
<br />
Casual rogue burst dps ~1600, raiding rogue ~2800<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The problem is, melee get a larger increase in dps as they progress through an expansion.<br />
<br />
Solution, new focus items for casters.  From another post:<br />
<br />
&quot;gear. make it better so a dps caster can get some kind of dps upgrade every tier of progression and before someone brings up focus i like to point out  a 15% average focus lead over a casual, again casual, isn't going to cut it for giving casters the dps upgrade between tiers they need. can look at melees on some of the tools to add to make dps spells work better between progression tiers.<br />
ie;<br />
fero(damage focus multiplier or better average focus rolls)<br />
Cleave (crits)<br />
Accuracy(resists)<br />
Ce(spell proc rates and spell refresh-sort of think of what the sk epic was going to be changed to on that)<br />
Strikethrough(Reflects and partial resists striking through and landing fully)<br />
+backstab,+frenzy( + 75 damage added to a nuke)<br />
with smart itemization it wouldn't be that Tough to add and maintain effects like that too(just keep the effects on a corresponding focus), in any case  int casters need better effects because the focus system is so far behind in helping their dps!&quot;<br />
Why not have item focus that :<br />
<br />
Increases crit rate and/or damage<br />
<br />
reduces agro (more than just the epic)<br />
<br />
gives additional small nuke<br />
<br />
Reduces resist rate<br />
<br />
The problem isn't (mainly) that our spells are lacking, its that there are significantly more increases for a raiding melee dps than for a caster.  We come out balanced at the start of an expansion fairly well with our new spells, but melee dps ramps up significantly as you pass through it while caster dps shows only a relatively small improvement with items.<br />
<br />
I'd love to do 2k dps sustained, but being realistic, how about just making our gear scale at a rate closer to melee's as we progress through an expansion.  The increase in current foci alone does not maintain give us melee scaling and results in raiding wizards feeling shafted.  Most posts complaining about our dps are from those of us that see a wizard go through 35k+ mana in 6 minutes and get outdps'd by rogues/monks/bezerkers.  And if staunch isn't up, only exceptionally luck crit rate will keep us in the top 10 dps on a burst raid fight.<br />
