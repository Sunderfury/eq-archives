Odd thing is I actually have a week off work at the moment just like I have for previous expansions, but it's by pure coincidence and I'm messing around in GW2 instead...</blockquote>

</div>Same with me.  This is the first WOW launch I haven't been involved with and I'm not bothered by it.  Cataclysm was a terrible expansion and the whole premise behind Pandaria never interested me so I'm sitting it out.  While I might return to WOW someday, right now I have no desire to do so.<br />
<br />
I still keep up with Blizzard's WOW forums from time to time (I guess I'm a masochist) and I have to say that this seems to be the least inspiring expansion launch WOW has had.  While people are interested, there's nowhere near the hype that we saw prior to the other expansions.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">It has occurred to me that the long-time players that have left might have a barrier to nostalgia.<br />
<br />
One of the key aspects of each expansion has been the mechanical overhaul of the game. Talents, abilities, power levels, techniques - it all gets whacked and re-done. No small tweaks here, kiddos! This creates a jarring experience for someone who wasn't around to explore the changes when they were implemented, in a stable environment, i.e. the several-months-long end-of-expansion fun time.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, nostalgic returns to EverQuest (or almost any other MMO) will see some mechanical changes, but very few overhauls. It's possible to play the game in the same way you did so long ago. WoW, on the other hand, defeats that.<br />
<br />
Hm.<br />
<br />
Alternately, it could be &quot;like playing a new game.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the first expansion I haven't been playing at launch. I've been reading this thread, to see what's going on (Delores does great write-ups!), but I have no interest or time to play.</blockquote>

<br />
No launch issues for North America, aside from early lag in Pandaria and the &quot;chat in public channels is repeated five times&quot; bug. That bug was just fixed ten minutes before I camped.<br />
<br />
Zones are beautiful. Music is beautiful. There's so much to do it boggles the mind. There's lore items (which are attached to achievements) around every corner, it seems. Tons of story. There's crowding, but it's not too bad. I notice it more when a half-dozen people all happen to be herbalists and near me, but even then, the nodes have the same spawn forcing mechanic as mobs do. I've stood in one place and harvested the same node three times in a row as it kept repopping.<br />
<br />
On all the alts, I got the panda tabard, uncapped all tradeskills, handed in those two dailies, used up old mats (the skill raises came surprisingly fast, even on green combines - hooray guild perk). That took one hour. Then I caged those extra pets, and put them on the AH - that took two hours. 700 pets, roughly. I'd sold 4600 g worth of them before I'd even finished listing them all, and as of when I logged I'm somewhere north of 30,000 g. Then I checked out pet battles, got my first rare quality pet, and realized I'm likely hooked on that. Then I created the new pandaren monk (and got the name I wanted - Pawlina), got her to 11, sent most of the stored crap to her once she was in Stormwind, and raised almost all her skills to whatever the cap is for a level 11 character (I think Cooking is only at 280). The Pandaren newbie zone is awesome - great flavour, beautiful, they handle the Alliance/Horde thing fairly well, and it really felt like one big story from start to finish. I then did a round of cooking/fishing dailies on all the alts. Then D went to Pandaria, and got 86. And here we are. And I'm tired, and I'm crashing. In terms of progress, the front runners in the race to 90 were 87 at around the seven hour mark, and almost all of the profession firsts had been taken (mining and herbalism went in the first half hour). Night!</blockquote>
