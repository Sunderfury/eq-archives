				EFRAT, West Bank (AP) — Plans to expand a West Bank settlement by up to 2,500 homes drew Palestinian condemnation Monday and presented an early test for President Barack Obama, whose Mideast envoy is well known for opposing such construction.<br />
<br />
Israel opened the way for possible expansion of the Efrat settlement by taking control of a nearby West Bank hill of 423 acres. The rocky plot was recently designated state land and is part of a master plan that envisions the settlement growing from 9,000 to 30,000 residents, Efrat Mayor Oded Revivi said.<br />
<br />
Israeli officials said any new construction would require several years more of planning and stages of approval.<br />
<br />
The outgoing government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said it reserves the right to keep building in large West Bank settlement blocs that it wants to annex as part of a final peace deal with the Palestinians. Efrat is in one of those blocs.<br />
<br />
The composition of Israel's next government is not clear yet, because last week's elections were inconclusive. However, right-wing parties are given a better chance to form a ruling coalition, with hard-line leader Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister.<br />
<br />
Speaking to U.S. Jewish leaders Monday, the two contenders for leading the new Israeli government expressed their differences over the Palestinian issue.<br />
<br />
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, whose centrist Kadima party won 28 of the 120 seats in parliament, said Israel must withdraw from &quot;parts of the Land of Israel,&quot; a reference to the West Bank, in a peace deal.<br />
<br />
Netanyahu, whose hawkish Likud won 27 seats, said he does not want to govern Palestinians but insisted on Israeli control of borders, airspace and electronic communications.<br />
<br />
Netanyahu supports settlement expansion and has derided peace talks with the Palestinians as a waste of time, saying he would focus instead on trying to improve the Palestinian economy. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called Netanyahu's approach unacceptable, and his aides said recently that peace talks can resume only if settlement construction is halted.<br />
<br />
&quot;We oppose settlement activity in principle, and if the settlement activity doesn't stop, any meetings (with the Israelis) will be worthless,&quot; Abbas said Monday.<br />
<br />
Settlement expansion is likely to create friction not only with the Palestinians, but with Obama, whose Mideast envoy, George Mitchell, has long pushed for a freeze on the expansion of Jewish settlements.<br />
<br />
Still, settlements have grown steadily, including during the past year of U.S.-backed peace talks that ended without results.<br />
<br />
Nearly 290,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements today, or 95,000 more than in May 2001, when Mitchell led a U.S. fact-finding mission to the West Bank to find ways of ending several months of Israeli-Palestinian violence and resuming peace talks.<br />
<br />
At the time, Mitchell called on Palestinian authorities to rein in militants involved in deadly bombings and shootings against Israelis, and he said Israel must freeze all settlement construction.<br />
<br />
The newly designated state land, called &quot;Eitam Hill&quot; by settlers, is more than 2 kilometers (a mile) north of Efrat and just east of a cluster of Palestinian towns and villages, with biblical Bethlehem at the center.<br />
<br />
Abdel Rahman al-Haj, a Palestinian plumber in Bethlehem, said that he owns 5.5 acres (2 hectares) between Efrat and Eitam Hill and that intruders with bulldozers had repeatedly tried to clear a dirt road across his land since last month, in an apparent attempt to create access to Eitam Hill. The dirt road was clearly visible during a visit Monday.<br />
<br />
Al-Haj said he filed a complaint with the Israeli police and obtained a stop-work order from Israel's Civil Administration, the branch of the Israeli military that deals with West Bank land use. Civil Administration officials had no immediate comment on the case.<br />
<br />
Revivi, the Efrat mayor, said he was unaware of bulldozers clearing al-Haj's land. &quot;Everything is done in accordance with what the government is allowing us to do,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
However, Efrat municipal engineer Moshe Ben Elisha wrote in a recent edition of the settlement's newspaper, Efraton, that &quot;efforts are currently under way to create continuity between Olive Hill (an area of Efrat) and Eitam Hill.&quot; He did not elaborate.<br />
<br />
Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights group involved in the case, said Monday that over the years Israel's government has assigned almost all areas designated as state land to settlements. Yesh Din said that is a violation of international law, which requires an occupying power to act for the benefit of the local population.<br />
<br />
&quot;Declaring these huge amounts of land as `state land,' as done by the Civil Administration, is only for expanding the settlement and not for the local Palestinian population,&quot; Yesh Din said.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As some of you may know I have been unemployed now for roughly 3 months, not counting the short 1 week stint as a cable installer. Today I applied for an Operations Support Rep position with Comcast. I have to say that my luck with Comcast has not been great in the I'm looking for a job arena. I've been shot down a few times now. Anywho I submitted my app today and got a phone call from an HR person at Comcast about 2 hours or so after submitting app. Unfortunately I was elbow deep in cookie dough with my 7 year old and the call came in as unavailable so I let it go to voicemail. I returned the call as soon as I could and got the HR persons voicemail, I left a message. I really want and need this job, so I would greatly appreciate any positive thoughts you could send my way.</div>

<br />
<b>Rye Bread</b><br />
<br />
To make two round loaves.<br />
<br />
1/4 cup honey<br />
1/4 cup molasses<br />
2 tablespoons fat source (e.g. butter, margarine, olive oil)<br />
2 tablespoons caraway seeds<br />
2 teaspoons salt<br />
1 cup boiling water<br />
<br />
Put all those together in a bowl and stir until the honey dissolves. Let cool until lukewarm.<br />
<br />
<i>You don't need to measure the molasses or the honey too precisely. I kinda glob it in until it looks rightish. You may want less or more salt depending on altitude, the gluten content of your flour, and the freshness of yeast.</i><br />
<br />
3/4 cup of warm water<br />
2 packages or 4 1/2 teaspoons active yeast (not the instant kind you use in bread machines)<br />
<br />
Dissolve the yeast into the water in the bowl you are going to mix in. Ideally the bowl should not be cold.<br />
<br />
<i>Again, you may need more or less yeast depending on the factors above and how much salt you put in. Basically sugars (the honey and molasses in this case) and gluten (in the flour) feed yeast, salt retards it. If your loaves don't rise enough or the bread is denser than you want, you need to reduce the salt, increase the sugars or gluten, or increase the yeast.</i><br />
<br />
Add the honey etc mixture from above to the bowl. (Make sure it has had time to cool -- if the water is still boiling you will kill the yeast.)<br />
<br />
2 cups rye flour<br />
3-4 cups bread or all-purpose flour (can be white, brown, multigrain)<br />
<br />
Add the rye flour and a cup of the other and mix -- if you are using a stand mixer you may need to push the stuff off the sides at some point with a spatula.<br />
<br />
Slowly add the remaining flour until the dough comes away from the edge of the bowl (i.e. is no longer sticky, but still hangs together as a ball). If you get it too dry you can add a little extra water. Then knead thoroughly.<br />
<br />
<i>If you are doing this with a stand mixer knead for about 2 minutes, probably 5 or so with dough hooks on a hand mixer. 10-15 by hand.<br />
<br />
The difference between bread flour and all-purpose flour is that bread flour has extra gluten, which feeds yeast.</i><br />
<br />
Grease a bowl with butter or margarine (I put the dough on the counter and just grease the bowl I used to mix in -- if you can't do this then your dough was too wet or too dry), and then put the dough in, rotating so the whole ball gets greased a little. Cover the bowl and let rise until double the size, which should take about an hour.<br />
<br />
<i>Dough needs to rise in a warm place. I actually put the bowl on a wire shelf right over the hot air register. </i><br />
<br />
Punch down and shape into two round loaves. Put on baking sheets (either greased or covered with baking paper) and cover. Let rise until doubled in bulk -- about 45 min to an hour.<br />
<br />
Bake at 350 F for about 30-45 min (check it at 30), or if you have a convection oven, at 400 F for about 20-25 min.<br />
<br />
With a non-convection oven you may want to cover the loaves with tin foil for the last 10 minutes to prevent the crust from becoming too brown.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic"> LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A one-of-a-kind bicycle belonging to U.S. cycling legend Lance Armstrong was stolen from a team truck in California just hours after he rode it Saturday on the first day of a nine-day race.<br />
<br />
Cancer survivor and seven-time Tour de France champion Armstrong is racing in the Amgen Tour of California this week as he attempts another comeback after retiring from the sport in 2005.<br />
<br />
Armstrong's first comeback came in 1998, two years after he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. Doctors gave him a less than 50 percent chance of survival.<br />
<br />
Armstrong announced the bike theft on his Twitter account Sunday morning and posted a photograph.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is only one like it in the world therefore hard to pawn it off. Reward being offered,&quot; he wrote.<br />
<br />
The bicycle that was stolen is not the one Armstrong rides every day during the race. The stolen bike is used only for time trials, a race in which cyclists ride individually at staggered intervals over a set distance and try to get the best time.<br />
<br />
The thieves took four bicycles from a truck Armstrong's Astana team had parked behind a hotel in Sacramento. The other three bicycles belonged to team members Janez Brajkovic, Steve Morabito and Yaroslav Popovych, Astana said.<br />
<br />
Armstrong, 37, won the Tour de France, considered the premier bicycle race in the world, a record seven times from 1999-2005.<br />
<br />
The 750-mile Amgen Tour of California ends Sunday. It is the second major race in which Armstrong has participated since announcing his comeback in September.<br />
<br />
He raced last month in the Tour Down Under in Australia, finishing 29th.<br />
<br />
Armstrong said he is aiming for another Tour de France victory this summer and was not expected to contend in the Australian race, which he used to gauge his fitness level after more than three years out of the saddle.</div>

				Anti-terror tactics 'weaken law'  <br />
 <br />
The law experts said many anti-terror measures breached human rights <br />
The UK and the US have &quot;actively undermined&quot; international law in the way they fight terrorism, a report by judges and lawyers has said. <br />
<br />
The independent International Commission of Jurists carried out a three-year global study. <br />
<br />
It concluded that many measures introduced to fight terrorism were illegal and counter-productive. <br />
<br />
It called for justice systems to be strengthened and warned that temporary measures should not become permanent. <br />
<br />
The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) is a non-governmental organisation which promotes the observance of the rule of law and the legal protection of human rights. <br />
<br />
After a painstaking study carried out over three years in several countries, the panel of eminent lawyers and judges concluded that the framework of international law that existed before the 9/11 attacks on the US was robust and effective. <br />
<br />
Lack of safeguards <br />
<br />
But now, it said, it was being actively undermined by many states and liberal democracies like the US and the UK. <br />
<br />
The report remarks upon the extent to which undemocratic regimes with poor human rights records have referred to counter-terror practices of countries like the US to justify their own abusive policies. <br />
<br />
  Many governments... have allowed themselves to be rushed into hasty responses to terrorism that have undermined cherished values and violated human rights <br />
<br />
Arthur Chaskelson<br />
Panel chairman <br />
<br />
The report will make uncomfortable reading for many in governments on both sides of the Atlantic, says BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner. <br />
<br />
The panel said the legal systems put in place after World War II were &quot;well-equipped to handle current terror threats&quot;. <br />
<br />
It said countries should use civilian legal systems to try suspects and &quot;not resort to ad-hoc tribunals or military courts to try terror suspects&quot;. <br />
<br />
The report's authors expressed concern at the lack of adequate safeguards in the use of control orders, the weakness of diplomatic assurances in relation to deportations and &quot;excessive detention without charge&quot;. <br />
<br />
Public protection <br />
<br />
Britain's pre-trial detention time limit of 28 days is one of the longest in the world. <br />
<br />
The British Home Office said the UK faced a severe threat from terrorism. <br />
<br />
 INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF JURISTS <br />
Promotes understanding and observance of international law and principles that advance human rights <br />
Founded in Berlin in 1952<br />
Comprised of up to 60 lawyers, including senior judges, attorneys and academics<br />

<br />
&quot;We recognise clearly our obligations to protect the public from terrorist atrocities whilst upholding our firm commitment to human rights and civil liberties,&quot; it said in a statement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our policies strike that balance, with new legislation facing rigorous scrutiny through external consultation and in Parliament as well as being subject to the Human Rights Act, which the UK government enacted.&quot; <br />
<br />
The ICJ report recommended an urgent review of counter-terrorism laws and policies to prevent serious and permanent damage to fundamental human rights principles. <br />
<br />
Fear of terrorism <br />
<br />
The panel reviewed counter-terrorism measures in over 40 countries, and heard from government officials, victims of terror attacks, and from people detained on suspicion of terrorism. <br />
<br />
It found that many states have used the fear of terrorism to introduce measures which are illegal such as torture, detention without trial, and enforced disappearance. <br />
<br />
Some of the world's top international law experts served on the ICJ panel, including Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and former United Nations human rights commissioner, and Arthur Chaskelson, former president of the constitutional court of south Africa. <br />
<br />
 FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE <br />
<br />
<br />
More from BBC World Service <br />
<br />
Mr Chaskelson, chairman of the panel, said: &quot;In the course of this inquiry, we have been shocked by the extent of the damage done over the past seven years by excessive or abusive counter-terrorism measures in a wide range of countries around the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Many governments, ignoring the lessons of history, have allowed themselves to be rushed into hasty responses to terrorism that have undermined cherished values and violated human rights. <br />
<br />
&quot;The result is a serious threat to the integrity of the international human rights legal framework.&quot; <br />
<br />
The report also called on the US administration of President Barack Obama to repeal any policies that were instigated under the &quot;'war on terror' paradigm&quot; that were inconsistent with international human rights law. <br />
<br />
&quot;In particular, it should renounce the use of torture and other proscribed interrogation techniques, extraordinary renditions, and secret and prolonged detention without charge or trial,&quot; the report recommended. <br />
<br />
It added that the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay should be closed in a &quot;human rights compliant manner&quot;, with inmates either released or charged. <br />
<br />
President Obama ordered the closure of Guantanamo Bay within hours of becoming president last month, as well as ordering a review of military trials for terror suspects and a ban on harsh interrogation methods

				Is it a crime to take pictures?  <br />
<br />
By Victoria Bone <br />
BBC News  <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Photographers staged a mass photo call in protest at the law<br />
<br />
<br />
From today, anyone taking a photograph of a police officer could be deemed to have committed a criminal offence. <br />
<br />
That is because of a new law - Section 76 of the Counter Terrorism Act - which has come into force. <br />
<br />
It permits the arrest of anyone found &quot;eliciting, publishing or communicating information&quot; relating to members of the armed forces, intelligence services and police officers, which is &quot;likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism&quot;. <br />
<br />
That means anyone taking a picture of one of those people could face a fine or a prison sentence of up to 10 years, if a link to terrorism is proved. <br />
<br />
The law has angered photographers, both professional and amateur, who fear it could exacerbate the harassment they already sometimes face. <br />
<br />
On Monday, a group is gathering outside New Scotland Yard for a &quot;mass picture-taking session&quot; in protest. <br />
<br />
The event is organised by the National Union of Journalists. It insists the right to take pictures in public places is &quot;a precious freedom&quot; that must be safeguarded. <br />
<br />
NUJ organiser John Toner said: &quot;Police officers are in news pictures at all sorts of events - football matches, carnivals, state processions - so the union wants to make it clear that taking their pictures is not the act of a criminal.&quot;   The problems we can see arising are with junior officers using the legislation to overcome situations they find uncomfortable <br />
<br />
Neil Turner <br />
British Press Photographers' Association<br />
<br />
<br />
Innocent photographer or terrorist? <br />
<br />
'Suspicious circumstances' <br />
<br />
The British Journal of Photography recently reported an incident involving a photographer in Cleveland who was stopped by a police officer while taking pictures of ships. <br />
<br />
He was asked if he was connected to terrorism, which he wasn't, and told his details would be kept on file. <br />
<br />
A Cleveland police spokeswoman told the journal that &quot;in order to verify a person's actions as being entirely innocent,&quot; anyone in &quot;suspicious circumstances&quot; could be asked to explain themselves. <br />
<br />
Photojournalist Marc Vallée is among those angry at the law. He specialises in covering protests and fears for the implications of Section 76. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alarm bells really are ringing,&quot; he told the BBC News website. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know some of it sounds a bit funny. Train spotters being stopped for taking pictures, that sort of thing, but I've spoken to people who've been on their own, at night and they're surrounded by several officers. It can be intimidating. <br />
<br />
&quot;It may be that officers are just doing their best with a bad law, but if that's the case, they need guidance to tell them, 'Stop harassing photographers.'&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr Vallée also pointed out that members of the Royal Family were part of the Armed Forces. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are we going to be stopped from photographing them?&quot; he said.  <br />
Photographers say they are frequently being stopped and searched <br />
<br />
'Outrageous' <br />
<br />
The NUJ said some police officers wrongly believed they had the right to delete photographers' images. <br />
<br />
Other critics, meanwhile, fear the new law could inhibit their right to peaceful, democratic protest. <br />
<br />
Leo Murray is a spokesman for climate change campaign group Plane Stupid. His members film any direct action they take. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's outrageous,&quot; he told the BBC News website. &quot;It's yet another in a long line of measures designed to erode people's civil liberties. <br />
<br />
&quot;Being able to film the police has completely changed the way they are able to police our protests. It's made us much, much safer and the risks of a violent confrontation have almost disappeared. <br />
<br />
&quot;If we couldn't film they could act with impunity, they could just mete out violence with the confidence that nobody would find out. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's absolutely no way we are going to observe this ban. If they try to bring charges against us we will fight them in the courts.&quot; <br />
<br />
In a statement, Number 10 said that while there were no legal restrictions on taking pictures in public places, &quot;the law applies to photographers as it does to anybody else&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;So there may be situations in which the taking of photographs may cause or lead to public order situations, inflame an already tense situation, or raise security considerations,&quot; it said. <br />
<br />
Photographers could therefore be asked to &quot;move on&quot; for the safety of themselves or others. <br />
<br />
&quot;Each situation will be different and it would be an operational matter for the police officer concerned as to what action should be taken,&quot; the statement added. <br />
<br />
Junior officers <br />
<br />
This discretion, however, is what some feel is the key problem with the law.  <br />
Critics fear the new law could stop them photographing legitimate protests <br />
<br />
Neil Turner, vice chairman of the British Press Photographers' Association, said he believed there was no intention among senior ranks of the police to prevent legitimate photography. <br />
<br />
&quot;The problems that we can see arising are with junior officers using the legislation to overcome situations that they find uncomfortable or where they make judgements about photography and don't know how to apply the legislation on the ground,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;We firmly expect that there will be inappropriate uses of the act and that someone will end up in front of a judge before there is some clarity and before the purpose of the act is properly defined.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Metropolitan Police insisted the law was intended to protect counter-terrorism officers and any prosecution would have to be in the public interest. <br />
<br />
&quot;For the offence to be committed, the information would have to raise a reasonable suspicion that it was intended to be used to provide practical assistance to terrorists,&quot; it said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Taking photographs of police officers would not, except in very exceptional circumstances, be caught by this offence.&quot;

<br />
<b>Proposals for number and responsibilities of mods</b><br />
<br />
The moderators elected on the last cycle were as follows:<br />
<br />
General Moderators:<br />
Grindel<br />
Luxum<br />
Mdar<br />
Lysandor<br />
Merrick<br />
Voca<br />
<br />
Game Moderators:<br />
WoW: Maledict<br />
Conan: Lysandor, Wjjapl<br />
Eve: Zumino, Xan<br />
EQ: Edimas, Cinexa, Daisea<br />
<br />
I stepped down when the admin duties fell to me. Luxum has resigned and Wjjapl lost his position when the Conan forums were merged back into general game forums. Current moderators will not automatically be considered for re-election, but may of course stand.<br />
<br />
My proposal is to elect this cycle 5 General moderators (responsible for all non-game forums) and 5 Game moderators (responsible for all game forums -- both game specific and the general other games forums). This would reduce the total number of moderators compared to last time by 3.<br />
<br />
Also, for the six month term these moderators are being elected for we will close the private moderator forum as an experiment, since many members of the board have argued strenuously in favour of this. The report forum will remain private.<br />
<br />
<b>Proposed procedure</b><br />
<br />
<i>Step 1: Call for candidates.</i> Candidates have one week to declare candidacy for the moderator positions. (I've started this because we are behind, but the time period can be discussed. My rationale for one week is that moderators need to be frequent board readers.<br />
<br />
Posters should feel free to start &quot;nomination threads&quot; for desired candidates, but no one who does not post themselves the Call for Candidates thread will actually be put forward for elections.<br />
<br />
<i>Step 2: Campaign.</i> A thread for discussion of each candidate will be started. Candidates are encouraged to provide a paragraph telling us why they should be elected. I am proposing a two week period -- is this too short?<br />
<br />
<i>Step 3: Voting</i> Now the controversial bit. Here is my proposal. Two polls, one for the Game moderator candidates and one for the General moderator candidates. The five candidates with the most votes at the end of the voting period will be considered elected.<br />
<br />
If there are only 5 or fewer candidates for either category then there will be a yes/no vote for each candidate and candidates receiving 50% yes votes will be considered elected. <br />
<br />
The downside of using the poll facility is that due to limitations on the board software you will need to accept the joint word of the technical admins (Nadiar, Ludarian, Camrael) with respect to double voting and other violations of the rules.<br />
<br />
I am also proposing a 2 week voting period.<br />
<br />
Discuss away!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Somewhat belatedly (again my apologies) I am calling for people willing to stand as candidates for moderator positions.<br />
<br />
Elected moderators will serve for six months. They may stand for re-election.<br />
<br />
Moderators operate to enforce the rules of the board, and to advise the administration if the rules or the moderation guidelines are in their view impeding the health of board. However rule changes can only be made by the board as a whole.<br />
<br />
Candidates should be sure to read the board rule set and the moderation guidelines. They should be aware that they are not an advisory board for Graffes (arguably we should have such a board and I am contemplating how to organize it.) Moderators should be on the boards frequently --- at least once a day.<br />
<br />
Currently we have general moderators and game specific board moderators. I am proposing -- please see other thread for discussion -- to this time around have general moderators and game moderators, rather than EQ or WoW moderators.<br />
<br />
<i>Finally, potential candidates should be aware that for the six months of their term we will be experimenting with having no private moderator forum. The report forum will remain private.</i> This is an experiment only, but it is something the board membership has consistently requested and I believe that as admin I have a responsibility to test it out.<br />
<br />
The moderators elected on the last cycle were as follows:<br />
<br />
General Moderators:<br />
Grindel<br />
Luxum<br />
Mdar<br />
Lysandor<br />
Merrick<br />
<br />
Game Moderators:<br />
WoW: Maledict<br />
Conan: Lysandor, Wjjapl<br />

EQ: Edimas, Cinexa, Daisea<br />
<br />
Luxum has resigned and Wjjapl lost his position when the Conan forums were merged back into general game forums. Current moderators will NOT automatically be considered for re-election.<br />
<br />
<b>Anyone wanting to stand for election this cycle must post in this thread within the next week.</b><br />
<br />
This thread will be heavily moderated -- any posts which are not announcing candidacy for moderator positions will be deleted. I will start a second thread for discussion of process, and any questions you may have. Once the slate of candidates are in place, there will be threads for candidate discussion as well.</div>
