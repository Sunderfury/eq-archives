Arnold said although in the industrial world bottled water is often no healthier than tap water, it can end up costing 10,000 times more.<br />
<br />
&quot;At as much as 2.50 dollars per liter (10 dollars per gallon), bottled water costs more than gasoline,&quot; the study says.<br />
<br />
<br />
---snip---<br />
<br />
<br />
The study warned that the rapid growth in the industry has also ironically led to water shortages in some areas, including India where bottling of Dasani water and other drinks by the Coca-Cola company has caused shortages in more than 50 villages.<br />
<br />
It said that while consumers tend to link bottled water with healthy living, tap water can be just as healthy and is subject to more stringent regulations than bottled water in many regions, including Europe and the United States.<br />
<br />
&quot;In fact, roughly 40 percent of bottled water begins as tap water,&quot; the study says. &quot;Often the only difference is added minerals that have no marked health benefits.<br />

Throwing out a maximum cost when an average would have been more informative made the author look like a biased asshole, especially because under normal circumstances the &quot;water&quot; that is sold at that price is actually sold for the minerals in it.

Aye, LA tap is the worst thing ever.  I'm not even sure if you can consider it to be water.  Up in nothern california were i grew up with had some of the best rated water in California and i was good friends with the guys son who ran all the water treatmant plants so i pretty much grew up on tap and im doing just fine....kinda...well considering that maybe you should drink bottled :)<br />

<br />
Regardless of the study, the bottled water industry is still fairly viable.  You can't always have your water filter on hand.  When you go out for lunch or on a drive or are at the gym, sometimes it's just a lot easier to pay for a bottle of  water.  It might not be better than tap water like people are led to believe, but it's a helluva a lot better than some alternatives.</div></div><hr />

I don't drink bottled water because I believe it's healthier than tap water, I drink it because it tastes better than Atlanta tap water that has traveled through pipes that are over 60 years old and unfiltered.<br />

I find this hard to believe since Dasani water is nothing more then purified tap water with minerals added.  Why would Coca-cola go through the expense of shipping tap water across oceans when they can use tap water from their local US plants and purify that for the same quality product at a cheaper cost?<br />
<br />
Also, nowhere on the Dasani bottles that I have purchased did it ever say product of India.  When you import a product, don't you have to state the country of origin?</div></div><hr />

Well I've been using the same fiji bottle for about seven months or so without changing and I've never been sick.  In fact, I survived whatever infected my family over Christmas while drinking from that bottle.  I usually refill the same bottle with britta filtered water until I lose the bottle.  I've had people tell me before that you shouldn't reuse them, but until I personally encounter a problem, I see no reason to stop.</div></div><hr />

Actually, if they are filled and emptied often, kept in a cool, dark environment, never cleaned with something course like a scouring pad (micro scratches give a place for bacteria to grow), and always kept upside down so water can fully drain out when empty should be fine.  The BOD of bottled water is very low and if handled properly should not grow very much.  But, if the container looks damaged or scratched or the water looks or smells funny then you should recycle the container and get a new one.<br />
<br />
That being said, there is always a possibility so I would agree with you and recommend though that they should be sanitized once in a while.  One tablespoon of household bleach (chlorine) per gallon of water for 20 minutes will kill almost all germs.  Then just drain, rinse, and refill.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And you Americans are cute thinking 60 y/o pipes are old :D I dont think the age has a direct affect on the taste. <br />
60 y/o pipes can impart a taste due to sentiment buildup and or material corrosion.  This is more of a concern for America then it is for Europe.  In America all non-military government projects are given to the lowest bidder using the cheapest material rather then the one who has the most quality using quality material.<br />
<br />
I remember reading a report about a study on tap water vs. bottled water and came to the conclusion that tap water, although it tastes far worse then bottled water, is much safer to drink and healthier for you.</div></div><hr />

I think the longest I've ever re-used a bottle for is around 8 months, and no, I never wash them and my stomach is never upset.<br />

If you are using the same bottle for 8 months without even a wash and dont get sick, that isnt proof that that is a great idea, but I take back the fibber accusation. I think you know deep down it is pretty unwise though :p<br />
<br />
<br />
I've had people tell me before that you shouldn't reuse them, but until I personally encounter a problem, I see no reason to stop.I've never crashed my car so I wont bother with a seatbelt! Because you cant see bacteria they dont exist for you? Honest, but unwise ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides the fact that 60 year old pipes are going to be made of a different material than what's used now....My point was that Europe has much older water pipes and much better tasting water, apparently. I think we spend more money on water reprocessing than you are willing to though. It still remains hundreds (thousands?) of times cheaper than bottled water however.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, we are spoiled and I like it that way.Unfortunately (for us), it's standards like this - that we have all become used to one way or another - that makes it so much cheaper for businesses to outsource or move abroad altogether. <br />
<br />
Sadly we are probably all going to have to reduce our energy consumption per head significantly over the next couple of centuries to prevent dangerous global warming, and possibly our resource consumption per head if population rises too much more. Let's hope technology can still rise fast enough to continue a net rise in standard of living overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are lots of things that 60 year old pipes can have coating the inside.  Iron, biofilm and mineral deposits can build up over time.  Many cities will flush their water system every few years to help reduce this build up.<br />
<br />
Today, we use a vinyl pipe to run our water through.  It lasts longer, is easier to install, and has less problems with build up than the iron pipes of the old days.  Oh, and it allows water to flow more freely allowing a savings on pumping.</div></div><hr />

Sure, but chloride? That'd only build up inside if it was added to the water in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
calcium oxide and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH<br />
FeCl3 to help remove particulate matter<br />
sodium hypochlorite to preserve the quality of the water and kill anything left over.<br />
<br />
And of course there's ozonation, sand filters and in some cases, carbon filtration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMG Yuck:wtf:! Might as well be drinking from the toilet since that will have less bacteria. And you prefer that to drinking from the tap?<br />

A study of water bottles at a Calgary elementary school found bacteria in kids' bottles that would prompt health officials to issue boil-water advisories, had the samples come from a tap. Researchers discovered bacterial contamination in about a third of the samples collected from kids' water bottles at the school. Some samples even showed evidence of fecal coliforms.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The fact is, a lot of these compounds have not really been studied in terms of their human health effects,&quot; said Margrit von Braun, a University of Idaho professor. Single-use soft-drink and water bottles are commonly made of a plastic called polyethylene terephthalate (PET) which, while considered safe for its intended use, was found to break down over time. &quot;The longer you used it, the more stuff ended up in the water,&quot; said von Braun.<br />
<br />
One of the toxins that frequently appeared in water samples from the reused bottles was DEHA, a carcinogen regulated in drinking water because it has been found to cause weight loss, liver problems, or possible reproductive difficulties. It is also suspected that DEHA can cause cancer in humans.<br />
<br />
As for tap water, the quality of the water heavily depends on if your city is near a fresh source of water or not. Toronto's water is actually quite drinkable despite the water coming from Lake Ontario (most people couldn't tell the difference with a blind taste test, and actually prefered the tap water to bottled), while the water from a town like Guelph which is more mainland tastes like mud and not good quality. In comparison, the water in New Brunswick in my hometown is better then both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was in Egypt a few months back, I loved having bottled water available, because I did not grew up in egypt therefore I did not adapt to the local germs in the water. Those germs did get me in the end of my stay though, and I spent the first few days at home pissing through the pooper.</div></div><hr />

Drinking out of your parents' stillsuits sounds very familial but still kind of icky :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, no.  Toilet water, unless heavy treated with a chloride tablet, has a much higher count of bacteria such as Ecoli.<br />
<br />
I never said I prefer drinking that over water from the tap so I have no idea where you got that from.  Oh, and don't forget that studies have shown that your toothbrush has Ecoli on it as well.  So . . . OMG Yuck :wtf: you brush with that!<br />

I've very strongly felt that the purification of our lifestyles is reducing the  effectiveness of our immune systems.  All the anti-bacteria soaps, detergents, gels and wipes that are on the market is absurd.  As is being concerned about re-using your water bottle repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Now, I do change the bottle out, just not very often.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you to an extent - our bodies are evolved to be in a microbiological enviroment, and removing bacteria completely, even the slightly harmful bacteria, isnt the best thing you can do. Your immune system, like every biological system, becomes weak through lack of use - or not developed at all even. I doubly agree with you that children should not be insulated from dirt (although being breastfed is an overwhelmingly powerful factor too). I think drinking from the same bottle for months pushes that principle recklessly far though.<br />
<br />
The other aspect you are ignoring is that our bodies are not evolved to cope with ingesting many man-made chemicals, which reach higher and higher levels over time. You are rightly cautious over high levels of artificial cleaning agents but not high levels of anything else! From that same article:<br />
<br />
<br />
BPA is believed to be an endocrine disruptor, a compound that confuses the endocrine systems of humans and animals. Endocrine disruptors have been found to mimic sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone, for example, potentially interfering with development and reproduction. In animal studies, BPA has been shown to contribute to an increase in breast and prostate cancers, reduced sperm production and chromosome damage, which can result in miscarriages. A 2003 study by a researcher at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine found that very low doses of BPA damaged the egg cells of female mice. (The mice lived in polycarbonate cages and drank from polycarbonate water bottles that had been washed and reused.)<br />
<br />
Now this isnt all 'nature is good, artificial is bad'. All advances have benefits outweighing their disadvantages (..else they'd be called... retreats(?)  :p ) But all advances have tradeoffs, and whilest there is no point being hysterical, and we all have to die of something, there is no sense being reckless either.</div></div><hr />

LOL  well, when I live in a polycarbonate house and drink solely from re-used polycarbonate bottles I'll begin to get concerned.<br />

I agree with you here.  I think our differences lie in where we draw the line between being hysterical and being reckless.</div></div><hr />
