</div>Yes but that is only going to work once or twice.  It sounds like Ike wants more of a perpetual process.<br />
<br />
For something like this to work quickly the only real method I see is to get it pushed onto them from above.  This method will likely work but will also guarantee the whole IT team will be your sworn enemy and you will either have to fight them on everything (you need new hardware? we'll get right on that! *circular file*) or they will be looking for opportunities to screw you over (or both).<br />
<br />
Have you and your manager sat down with IT management and the head admin to discuss what you are trying to do and see if you can get them to facilitate it?</blockquote>

If SOX compliance is a big deal for your company the separation of duties policies may be there explicitly to clarify chains of accountability-- often explicitly preventing software developers from having any write-access at all to production systems.<br />

</div>Generally speaking, operations first priority is keeping the engines running.  If you have a web application that generates revenue for the company, downtime translates pretty directly into lost revenue.  From an ops perspective, release cycles and change controls are in place to reduce costly downtime (or the risk of it).  They're also in place to help ensure accountability rests with people of the right pay grade and that institutional ops knowledge is preserved as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Why is the deployment process so long and tedious?  Where is the bottleneck?  Where is there bloat?  How much downtime is required for a particular change?  <br />
<br />
Are there other cost reasons why it is the way it is?  What's preventing an A/B deployment model or something similar?  <br />
<br />
How stable does the application tend to be after a release?  How often have developers introduced bugs that cause webservers to crash nightly at 2:00 AM, requiring the admins to wake up and restart the services?  If devs have a reputation for forgetting to turn off debug flags or allowing other crap into production then there may be a lot of extra QA and review processes required to certify the code into production.  Because in some cases, even when it was bad code that caused the site to go down and impact revenue, the downtime still counts against Operations uptime SLAs.</blockquote>

<br />
For example, code updates that do not require a database schema change might incur far less risk.  You might be able to have a weekly morning maintenance window for those changes.  Especially if those are the easiest portion for the operations team to automate.  Ruthlessly cut any changes that don't belong in that window.</blockquote>

</div>I agree except for the absolutely toxic attitude of circumventing the sysadmin and categorizing them as people who just get in the way and get grumpy about having to answer service calls.<br />
<br />
Operations care about the customer too, they just care about different things.  They measure in nines of uptime rather than whether the cool new feature makes it in before an arbitrary business deadline.  Production downtime is kind of like a forest fire except with piles of money instead of trees.<br />
<br />
Do you guys remember how fucking awesome Everquest was by 2000 or so?  When WoW came out, people basically accepted weekly downtime as a matter of course.  With EQ, people could stay logged in for MONTHS at a time.  That's a huge tell that there was a solid relationship between developers and system administrators.</blockquote>

</div>Not really.  Once you get so big, it's just a matter of scale and bandwidth, your processes and design remains pretty much the same.</blockquote>

</div>I agree. The framework you need for 400k people has to be very, very scalable. Thus, the processes will be very similar to the n million users.<br />
<br />
My point was this: Even when you're used to running a large system, you're going to run into unforeseen issues if you scale it up by a factor of 20 (30 when WoW was at its peak). <br />
It's impossible to predict everything when the scaling is that large.</blockquote>

</div>If you review a history of EVE-Online you can really see this,   Because it is one realm they have had 50k+ users on one server.  For them at least they ended up having to run the game's databases off something called a RAM-SAN which is apparently an industrial grade SSD.</blockquote>
