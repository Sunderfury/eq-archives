<br />
There isn't really a &quot;better&quot; between good and evil (or Qeynos and Freeport, respectively). No one can tell you which is better, because it all comes down to personal preference. That said, it never hurts to get more information to help you make that decision.<br />
<br />
First, I would choose a race that you like. Depending on the race you choose, that may determine whether you can start in Qeynos or Freeport. If you select a neutral race, the next step is decide whether you want to follow Antonia Bayle in Qeynos or Lucan D'Lere in Freeport. Note that if you choose to follow the leader from a city your race cannot start in, do not despair! You can betray your city and join the opposition via a betrayal quest in your early to mid teens.<br />
<br />
At the risk of making the decision even harder for you, I'll close with some lore about each:<br />
<br />
<b>Antonia Bayle - Ruler of Qeynos</b><br />
<br />
Antonia Bayle is ruler of the kingdom of Qeynos. Born with the name Shirrana on a small island isolated for centuries by cataclysms, she had no idea that she was descended from the ruling house of Qeynos. When the cataclysms subsided and word reached her island that the Bayle family had been wiped out by disaster, the guardians of the young woman's secret finally revealed the truth of her destiny. Shirrana went to Qeynos with letters that proved her ancestry, and she began the process of learning how to be a leader. After several years of training, she assumed the title of Antonia and took the throne; she has led her city for over seven years.<br />
<br />
Though only in her late 20s, Antonia Bayle is already an accomplished leader. Possessing an enigmatic charm and an undeniable beauty, she immediately commands the attention of all who see her. But she is far from just a pretty face; she proved soon after her arrival in Qeynos that she has a natural gift to inspire her people and make wise decisions regarding their future. She speaks from the heart and motivates her subjects to believe in their ability to achieve great things.<br />
<br />
Antonia cares little for the accumulation of personal power, putting all of her time and energy toward the benefit of her city. To her, the past is simply prologue; she encourages her subjects to put aside old rivalries for the good of the future. She constantly emphasizes accomplishments over failures, believing strongly that people must move past their mistakes and learn to improve the lives of everyone around them.<br />
<br />
In keeping with the tradition that no ruler of Qeynos should ever be called king (or queen), Antonia sees herself as a representative of her people. Though she does not shun her royal lineage, she portrays herself as a fellow citizen who faces the same challenges as the average person. Her speeches appeal to commoner and aristocrat alike, making clear that all people have a responsibility to one another, regardless of station. When speaking of the accomplishments of her people, she emphasizes that a victory for one is a victory for all. Antonia understands her people's need for faith, and so she encourages religious freedom. Though she advocates no specific deity herself, she sees any belief in a benign god to be a positive thing that can inspire people to do the right thing.<br />
<br />
When speaking of the rival city of Freeport, Antonia is careful to direct her animosity at its leader, not its people. She openly despises Lucan D'Lere, who has attempted to deceive and mislead her multiple times in the past. She will portray him as the liar and manipulator that he is, but rarely depicts the people of Freeport as anything other than misguided. If a former follower of D'Lere renounces his evil ways and proves to have a desire to work toward the greater good, Antonia will accept him gladly and count such a conversion as a victory for Qeynos. She wants to see Lucan fall so that all citizens of Freeport have the opportunity to accept a new path, but she is wary of a costly war between the cities.<br />
<br />
Though kind and giving by nature, Antonia Bayle is extremely willful and does not back down from what she knows to be the right thing to do. While open to compromise in many areas, she will not negotiate her belief in justice. She is a formidable ruler who has earned the respect of those around her by being that rare combination of idealist and pragmatist, believing a better future is possible only through hard work and unity - as well as the judicious use of force.<br />
<br />
<b>Lucan D'Lere - Overlord of Freeport</b><br />
<br />
Lucan D'Lere is the evil Overlord of the city of Freeport. He rules Freeport from his levitating fortress called Twilight Citadel, keeping order with an iron fist and unbending will. His origins and background are clouded in secrecy and lore; those who tell tales do not often last long enough to be heard again. Some say Lucan appears in public wearing dark, foreboding armor. Others say he came from unusual places to command his post. No clearer information is known.<br />
<br />
Lucan is a seasoned, battle-hardened commander of a great army. His face is deeply scarred, suggesting an age greater than Lucan lets on. He is an extremely charismatic individual; his stride is that of a confident and strong ruler, and his voice is rich and deep - audiences are mesmerized when he speaks fluidly and demonstratively. Lucan's sole focus is maintaining and expanding his personal power. He believes the way to do this is to make himself appear indispensable to his people. Indeed, his people cannot avoid his influence. Lucan makes it so, and has created Freeport as his domain for enforcing his influence upon the various races that make their home there.<br />
<br />
In his speeches, Lucan will often rewrite history to portray himself as the key figure in epic battles and crucial decisions that have benefited the city of Freeport. He constantly reiterates that he is responsible for keeping his kingdom safe, and that only through his rule can the people prosper.<br />
<br />
Unlike most human dictators, Lucan does not need for his people to love him. He demands their respect and total obedience, but any aspect of his personality that needed approval or affection has long since withered away. Lucan will appeal to his people's patriotism, their greed and their fears, but he will never seek to play upon positive emotions. He is only interested in using the population's strength to further his own agenda. While he praises the efforts of his subjects, he always frames their contributions as having only been possible through the security that his rule provides.<br />
<br />
Though he tolerates those who practice most religions, Lucan will downplay the role of the ancient gods whenever possible. He has taken advantage of their absence to paint them as weak and false beings who were never really gods at all. Lucan has no qualms about portraying himself as a divine being far more worthy of worship.<br />
<br />
Similarly, D'Lere will take every opportunity possible to insult and degrade the rival city of Qeynos and its leader, Antonia Bayle. He will portray her as weak, incompetent and corrupt, playing up the sometimes sordid history of the Bayle family. Though he stops short of declaring open warfare, his goal is to crush Qeynos economically and politically, leaving the city ripe for his influence. He has not, however, ruled out the use of force in the future if it proves necessary.<br />
<br />
Lucan is an expert at incorporating just enough truth in what he says to make it seem believable while weaving elaborate lies designed to bind his subjects to his will. D'Lere never opens his mouth without planning exactly what he is going to say. He inspires loyalty through fear, never showing any sign of weakness. But it is the forceful and insistent manner in which he speaks that captivates the crowd and helps make him a brutally effective leader. His favorite phrase (often used to punctuate speeches) is &quot;Strength in unity; unity in Lucan!&quot;<br />
