I recently filled out a screening form from Microsoft for an SDET position in Denmark, and I found the screening questions to be pretty fun. Specifically, this one:<br />
<br />
Write me a function that receives three integer inputs for lengths of the sides of a triangle and returns one of four values to determine the triangle type (1 = scalene, 2 = isoceles, 3 = equilateral, 4 = error). Generate test cases for the function, assuming another developer coded the function.<br />
<br />
This was my pseudo-code response:<br />
<br />
<br />
func isResultValid(int typeValue)<br />
   if typeValue (&gt;3 or &lt;1) return (false) else return (true);<br />
<br />
func compareTriangleSides(int leftSide, int rightSide, int oppositeSide)<br />
   int typeValue = 0;<br />
   if args {<br />
      if ((left == right) and (right == opposite)) typeValue = 3 else<br />
      if ((left == right) or (left == opposite) or (right == opposite)) typeValue = 2 else <br />
      typeValue = 1<br />
   }<br />
return (isResultValid (typeValue) ? typeValue : 4)<br />
<br />
What test cases would you come up with for this one? I came up with a bounds check for overloading, three bad data checks (one and all 0 values, non ints) and three good data checks for each triagle type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about a test with negative values?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should make sure it can be a triangle.  The longest side has to be shorter than the two shortest sides added together.<br />
<br />
validate the data (all real positive integers, outer bound of variable size, etc).<br />
validate that it can possibly be a triangle<br />
<br />
I would have taken the numbers as an array, since its just one triangle, and then you can sort it.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Not true for Equaliteral where all sides are the same length. Other than that I like the array idea and sorting, it means your function can take arguments in any order (think triangle orientation), rather than &quot;left&quot;, &quot;opposite&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Also, for me as an interviewer giving such tests, I'm 60% interested in the solution 40% interested in your coding style. Is it readable? Does it demonstrate interesting solutions? Is it efficent? etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonas</div><div class="date">August 12th, 2010, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, unfortunately, I'm a very amature code writer, I did think about using a collection, but this was just as easy for such a simple method. I do agree that it should have some validation to prove that it can be a triangle.<br />
<br />
What I meant by &quot;three good data&quot; was that I would test with data that matched each triangle type to verify the logic actually works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elasto</div><div class="date">August 12th, 2010, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Without wiki'ing anything, would a test to see if the sides form a valid triangle be to work out the angles between the sides and check they sum to 180? You'd need some margin or error for when it summed to 179.99998 of course<br />
<br />
(Assuming the triangle is based in Euclidean space, of course...)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, given that the triangle has integer sides, I'm sure there's only a limited number of patterns for that - the old 3/4/5 and 5/12/13 types as well as 1/1/1 etc. But I'd have to research for that. For example, I'm suspicious that it might not actually be possible to have an isosceles triangle with integer sides.</div></div><hr />

Oh, oops, I was writing it my media center system, and rewrote it a couple times, since the first few times I was trying pseudo-code.  I missed the &quot;shorter than or equal to&quot;</div></div><hr />

Take 2 lines of the same integer length and imagine they are hinged together. Swivel the lines about until the distance between the other 2 ends is an integer.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
No, he's correct, you misread.  He is saying, where a= longest side, a cannot be larger than b+c or you would end up with 3 parallel lines, not a triangle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">August 13th, 2010, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These questions all tend to be about elegance. Yeah, yeah, ironically MS is testing to see if you can write short elegant code.<br />
<br />
As such, the only way to 'win' is to have the questions ahead of time really as they'll assume you do sadly and every single one of them is a logic trap in some form. (Google is no better by the way.) Then comment the crap out of the standard answers and go from there. Protip: recursion and Case or For logic tends to score better even though it is in theory pseudocode and even worse though they rarely compile to advantage.</div></div><hr />

He is saying, where a= longest side, a cannot be larger than b+c or you would end up with 3 parallel lines, not a triangle. To avoid any &quot;equilateral doesn't have a longest side&quot; arguments, any side must be shorter than the other two sides added together. It is just that you only have to check the longest side in practice.</div></div><hr />
