		<blockquote class="restore">There is apparently a temporary mystic forge recipe that A.net implemented to get rid of excess of certain materials (namely lumber). You take two stacks of 250 of a material, a mystic coin, and a glob of ecto. You get a mystic chest, which contains a mystic component, a tonic, and a trophy you vendor for varying amounts (10 or 20 silver - 2 gold is what I've read). <br />
<br />
You combine 4 common mystic components for a mystic node. You then combine the mystic node, two rare components, and 50 mystic coins, to get...wait for it...<br />
<br />
A permanent portable Mystic Forge.<br />
<br />
Not mind blowing or anything, but extremely convenient. The fact it is a temporary recipe annoys me though. I did not rush to 80, I don't know if I will be able to make this while it still works. I already missed out on easy gems, and a few other things. <br />

</div>Well shit, I had no idea what you were talking about. I just thought of speculating on mystic coins today, and came to post about it. The most any one person can get a month is something like 50, but many recipes in the mystic forge need at least 50. Why the hell is anyone selling these at all? <br />
<br />
The fact I did not think of it sooner makes me sick. I suppose I can hardly blame me, as it's hard to find information on this game, and for the longest time I haven't known what half of this stuff was for. Seems like every worthwhile piece of information has been from reddit, and I don't read reddit, so bah to that. I tried once when I realized this, but it seems to be something you have to basically read all day to find the good stuff. When I tried all I saw was the same useless garbage you would find on any random forum.<br />
<br />
Anyway I missed out on getting them for the price of dirt, but they still only sell for 2 silver. I can't imagine this price not raising even higher as more people get to 80 and realize what the dang things are for. Ugh, I'm getting irritated just thinking about it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if it's any consolation to myself, you yourself are late on the low level mats thing. Apparently Pint knows something you don't! Because of the recipe I mentioned above, low level materials have been selling for more than usual. Copper Ore is sticking to about 20 copper each, but green wood and butter jumped from 2-3 copper to 10-12. I've been happily selling it all on my alts all week without even realizing what the hell was going on.</blockquote>

</div>It's attainable if you have about 3 gold. The components are all on sale on the TP, as well as the ingredients needed to make them. I thought stuff like ecto would be pretty expensive, but it's not. It costs about 60-75 silver to make a chest for a random chance at a piece.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I got lucky on my very first shot and got the rarest piece (which sells for 1.4-1.6 gold). Why is this unfortunate? Because it gave me an unreasonable expectation on how easy the rest would be. I then proceeded to blow 3 gold getting nothing but the common pieces and worthless transformation potions. Extremely irritating, it will cost me 2 gold to finish it by buying the last piece. This basically cancels out the abyss dye I got lucky and sold, grrr.<br />
<br />
So yeah, buy the dang pieces and skip the gambling part of it all.<br />
<br />
I still don't get why people are selling the coins, or how there are so many to sell.</blockquote>

So, for a change of pace, I did my first dungeon run yesterday: did AC Story mode<br />
<br />
I realized that I have no friggin' clue what a Guardian's role in a group is.  I ended up just running around dying a lot and trying to spam damage with my Greatsword or Sword/Torch combo.<br />
<br />
Can someone give me some tips on what a Guardian should be doing in a dungeon group?  Or point me to a page that lists some tips?</blockquote>

<br />
Bombs are looking more interesting than they used to. I discovered that I can enable auto-attack on Bomb 1 by ctrl-rclicking, which helps. As soon as I'm 60, I'm gonna try out the trait that makes bombs heal (and a bunch of other cool sounding traits!)</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I've Google'd for some tips, but it's hard to weed out the people selling crap guides from the people with any actual advice.  YouTube has lots of different build videos, but they are mainly from Beta/Stress Tests or high level dungeon runs with skills I don't have yet.<br />
<br />
I have tried posting on the GW2 forums, asking for input, but for some reason I can't log in there.  I get a log in screen, enter my stuff, it goes to a Terms of Service acceptance screen.  I click 'agree' and hit continue and get an error about an invalid token or some crap.  Been that way for a couple of weeks.  I have emailed support about it, and they escalated it to a senior support person, but haven't heard anything yet.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Now, I don't know if at level 80 people have found the absolute optimum builds or what have you, but in my experience there is no specific role any one class needs to be filling. You have a wide variety of abilities you can choose to use at your own discretion. Certain encounters will want you to use certain kinds of abilities (say conditional removal or aoe), but generally do want you want. It's not going to be like WoW where everything is orderly and predictable.<br />
<br />
So the basics that every class does: do damage, identify moves that need to be dodged, rez people who didn't dodge. :D I don't know much about the class itself, it looks like they are good at buffing and removing conditions though. That wall that blocks projectiles would be good on certain fights though. Blocks in general are good if you time them right. I like to switch from bow to greatsword, charge in, execute a block, then dodge back out and switch to bow. I didn't do it on purpose, but the last time I did this I blocked an attack on a downed person, and they had time to get up and get out of the way.<br />
<br />
The reason why are you are dying is because 1) it's still unfamiliar to you, 2) the game is simply designed that way. You are expected to die, even if you know what you are doing. A couple of us helped some guildies in AC story the other day, two 80s and a 50 (me), and each of us still got downed several times despite knowing what we were doing.</blockquote>
