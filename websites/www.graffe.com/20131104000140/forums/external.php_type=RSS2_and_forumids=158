Ever, Jane (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/30564009/ever-jane-the-virtual-world-of-jane-austen) 
 
Just a few hundred grand more and they can have a player economy!</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Not sure if anyone here was ever a big fan of the Quake series, but someone mentioned to me the website quakelive.com (or is it org?) And I clicked on the link and wow. It's old school quake arena, but with really easy to use interface, graphics, you name it - and it integrates somehow into your browser, so you can play it on virtually any device; a couple people I know actually play it on mac!<br />
<br />
I always sucked at the game, and I'm definitely no better, but its a very quick and easy way to jump into some deathmatch FPS battle on the game that really did it right the first time(s). Mindless, virtually mission free and nonstop blasting. A welcome relief for 15 to 20 minutes without getting heavily involved in anything that truly matters.</div>

I recently returned to EverQuest and I am having a blast.  Currently level 70 gnome wizard on the Vox server.  Graffe's used to be the place for Wizard information.  Are there any old archived posts around?  I have been filtering this forum on EverQuest it seems lacking in the information department.<br />

Thanks for your time,<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm curious if anyone else has been hitting the moba scene.  At 1st i was watching some of those twitch  streams and wondering why it's so popular. After playing  it casually for the last few months i can see why. it's a great game to just pop in, have some social interaction and play for 40 mins of your time. Not really like wow that's going to be a 2-3 hour long commitment and getting nothing done. of course end up wanting to play 3 or 4 matches so evens out lol. :)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Fun game.  I really enjoy the wacky Japanese critters and game sensibilities.  In the end I could not get used to the way their circles on the ground work.  (You can be long out of the circle and the shit still hits you).  I also sort of ran out of stuff to do.  For what it's worth, I recommend the game to anyone that likes themepark games.  <br />
<br />
Zaes' crew is awesome and was really fun to play with.  <br />
<br />
On to the next one... hmnn maybe back to GW2 (circles at least work there) or maybe back to Secret World to see if they fixed that game.</div>
