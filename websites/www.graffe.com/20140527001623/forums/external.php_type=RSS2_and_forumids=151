			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>All: We've had an issue with Apache (the service that served you websites) for the past few weeks where it fails less than gracefully.  A few times it has happened I've been online and noted it failed and had it restored within 10-15 minutes.  This weekend it was down from 5am to 9am, because I was asleep.  <br />
<br />
Troubleshooting is hampered because Apache uses all of the RAM and CPU on the system and I can't get into it so I can take a look.<br />
<br />
I've replaced it with nginx, which runs way more efficiently than Apache.  I didn't build us on nginx originally because 1) I didn't want to change too much at the same time 2) I hadn't adminned nginx, and wasn't confident in my ability to troubleshoot it.<br />
<br />
If you see anything weird, please let me know so I can fix it.</div>
