I'd already downloaded a bootleg copy of the whole thing off of newsgroups ages ago.  It's just not worth the cash.  It was barely worth the bandwidth I'd dedicated to getting it.</div></div><hr />

Beware that what you are seeing isn't her part with a pre and post shot done with some other scrawny blonde chick who actually knows how to do porn.  When they first were released they combined them with other scenes to lengthen the movies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Her parents (dad) inherited the money from the Hilton fortune, and truly the apple couldn't have fallen firther from the tree. <br />
<br />
Her family are those type of idiots that always seem to land on their feet. I have seen her father and mother give an interview and they don't seem to be very interesting people either.<br />
<br />
That video is a flaming pile of crap, and nothing will change that.<br />
<br />
She has the body of a 14 year old boy, and Rick Solomon has zero talent, small penis, and appears to have zero charisma as well.<br />
<br />
That's what I call a failure to communicate.</div></div><hr />

I guess &quot;Reality Sex&quot; would be the new trend.  The other famous ones, Bret Micheals and Pam Anderson and Tommy Lee with Pam were full of stuff that didn't look scripted for mass consumption.  The Paris Hilton video seems believable too since she's so bad in bed and acts like such a dumb, spoiled bimbo.</div></div><hr />

I've seen the parents do interviews too. They seem so proud that their daughter has gone from socialite bimbo in real life to socialite bimbo on tv.</div></div><hr />

Taking personal attacks across posts are we?<br />
Dude, take a deep breathe man, you're losing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Personal attacks are not allowed. <br />
Debate the post, not the poster.  Personal attacks are taken seriously and will be dealt with using whatever action is needed.  If you think you are being attacked you should ask yourself why it is an attack.  If it simply disagrees with your post and tells you that you are wrong, this is not an attack. <br />
Violent personal attacks and threats will result in a suspension or permanent banning, depending on the situation. <br />
&quot;Your post is quite idiotic.&quot; - Not a personal attack. <br />
&quot;You are an idiot.&quot; - Mild personal attack, generally not a problem. <br />
&quot;You are a f##king idiot... I wish death on you and a pox on your family!&quot; - Violent personal attack. Big problem</div></div><hr />
