			<div class="message">I have a problem with remakes.  There are approximately fifty kajillion great scripts waiting to be read sitting in some huge pile in Hollywood, and the executives go and look at it while they snort coke off a hooker's tits and think &quot;I wonder if we've done a Partridge Family remake yet...&quot;</div>

	</div>
</div>So a couple weeks ago I rented the &quot;new&quot; 21 Jump Street with Jonah Hill in it. It was hilarious, would watch again.<br />
<br />
Anyway, at one point early in the movie, the plot is described to the main characters by their chief as, &quot;We're reviving a canceled undercover project from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and they've run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle shit from the past and hope that nobody will notice.&quot;<br />

			<div class="message">NO, because Robocop was about a man who survived a cybernetic transformation - foisted on him to prevent his death and serve corporate interest - because he believed in protecting the innocent and serving the law and order. He found himself between his corporate saviors and the law and police, and eventually sides with doing what's right. HE IS NOT THE PUNISHER. He is not Judge Dredd. He's not even Adam Jensen. He is Lawful shiny fucking GOOD and is a goddamn hero. <br />
<br />
Just one look at that suit and I already can tell it's going to suck so bad, be so far from the original murphy, that it makes my asshole chap just thinking about it. <br />
<br />
Fuck these remakes. I don't know what philisophical bugg my generation has up its ass where it can't fucking stand even ONE good guy --<br />
<br />
Fuck you people Ned Stark was amazing -  my favorite fucking character, you douchebags can Eat a Dick.<br />
<br />
-- because we're so wrapped up in ambiguous moralities and ideas of justice and blah blah blah that we just fucking SEETHE seeing someone trying really fucking hard to do good and get even madder when thy actually start to succeed. Eat me. You're FUCKING with robocop, and it's gonna be terrible.</div>

</div>&quot;The Thing&quot; wasn't a remake, though, it was a more respectful adaptation of the original Campbell short story, &quot;Who Goes There.&quot;  The original bore little resemblance really.  And then the recent movie was a prequel to the Eighties one, and a very solidly written one at that.  &quot;Ocean's Eleven&quot; was WAY better with the Rat Pack in it in the original film, and &quot;Little Shop&quot; was a musical adaptation, which brought originality to the remake.</blockquote>

</div>I can see why. When my buddy hears about an original movie, he usually waits to hear what the critics think before deciding whether to go or not. Yet when Regurgitated_Superhero_Movie05 comes out, we're going, period. There's big risks in going original, and unless you have a lot of discipline with the budget any failures will cost a studio millions of dollars.<br />
<br />
As for the Robocop suit - meh. I'm waiting for the trailer before I decide if it looks bad or not, since there could be all sorts of CGI stuff added. There's only been one still photo recently where I took one look and knew the show would suck - Adrianne Palicki as Wonder Woman.</blockquote>
