<br />
Recently upgraded my boot drive on the home pc, and the only way I could find to make the new SSD the primary boot disk (as opposed to booting off it and windows insisting in using files on the old mechanical drive also) was to unmount the original boot drive in Computer Management - this had the (oops moment) effect of deleting the data partition.<br />
<br />
Whilst there is nothing mega important on the drive (all my important docs/pics are on a NAS), I would like to get some stuff off the drive (mainly game saves tbh).<br />
<br />
any thoughts on a decent tool to recover the data?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I don't want to go into the details, but a while back my computer crapped out. So, I sent it to the person who built it and waited, and waited, and waited. Well, ultimately I had to take the computer back before it was properly fixed. He told me that I was going to have to switch it to &quot;RAID&quot; as soon as I turned it on because he was diagnosing it. Sounds easy enough. I plug everything in, turn on the computer and....I get no video. I switch the cord to the motherboard video spot and still I get nothing. Ok, well, I can't do anything if I can't see what's happening on the computer. So, I shut the computer down. I turn the computer back on and now, the computer turns on for about 15 seconds and then shuts off. It reboots on it's own and does the same thing. It will continue to start up and shut down on it's own indefinitely. The only way I can get it to stop is to turn off the power. As it reboots some of the fans on the towers will not work and then they will work. It is fairly random.<br />
<br />
So, is my motherboard fucked or is this something that can be fixed?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>How extensive is being able to specify layouts and dimensions of information frames with modern web tools?  E.g. can I get as much fine control over the web UI as I can on a local application?  It looks like very media rich sites and complex layouts are possible, but I'm unaware of how specific I can be on how the individual sections are presented and what their area will be.  I am wanting to use webkit + some other glue as a UI for a desktop app so that it is more portable is why I ask.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>constantly updating itself every start up<br />
and then yesterday it went FUBAR and actually buggered up my internet connection! <br />
I figured that out as Steam kept booting saying couldn't connect and then I couldn't connect <i>any </i>webpages or services<br />
so by uninstalling Steam and oh joys it thus deleted all games, too!! assholes!! and could connect ot net again<br />
<br />
so, turned off &quot;steam start on boot&quot;, but it started happening soon as I rebooted my PC and started steam again manually, pissing me off no end<br />
a regedit thing helped but then Steam update again and started it messing it all again, FUCK!<br />
<br />
Origin works fine, it's jsut some Steam bullshit<br />
<br />
feels like first 6 months of steam all over again when it it was an atrocious piece of shit :/<br />
anyone got any suggestions, fixes, similar problem? sigh</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Alright, <br />
<br />
To start with I've gone through the Windows 7 support forums on Microsoft's site.<br />
<br />
Not sure WTF happened.<br />
<br />
No icons, of any kind, on the desktop.<br />
<br />
But they are still present in the desktop folder.<br />
<br />
I cannot add anything to the desktop (as an icon).  Nothing appears, but the file does appear in the desktop folder, just not actually on the desktop.<br />
<br />
I've double (triple, Quadruple!) checked that the &quot;display icon&quot; option is checked.<br />
I've tried hard boots, I've tried a system restore (to Monday).  Run a virus scan.<br />
Problem persists in safe mode.<br />
I've got nothing.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div>
