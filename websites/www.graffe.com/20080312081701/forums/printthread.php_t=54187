		<div>Good point, Mr N. Although, to be fair, the mother in this case isn't choosing to die, she is just choosing to refuse medical treatment. She hopes, of course, not to die.<br />
<br />
I note that in Ireland, a mother's wish not to have a transfusion was overruled by the courts on the grounds that &quot;the right of the newborn baby to have a family life overrules the mother's right to refuse treatment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Makes sense to me.<br />

				<div>Originally Posted by <strong>http://www.ajwrb.org/basics/abstain.shtml</strong></div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">Many Jehovah's Witnesses sincerely believe that it is a gross sin to accept a blood transfusion, since the Bible states that we must &quot;abstain from blood.&quot; (Acts 15:29) It is quite understandable that many are confused by the position taken by the Watchtower Society (WTS)  with respect to the various blood components or blood products like albumin, (Erythropoietins), vaccines, immunoglobulins, and hemophiliac treatments. It does not seem possible to explain why it is a violation of God's law to accept plasma, platelets, red and white cells when all of the fractions of these are permitted by the WTS. These contradictions have caused a number of elders and Hospital Liaison Committee Members to quietly resign. <br />
Additionally, the trend in recent years has been to allow more and more blood products. The June 15, 2000 Watchtower, Questions From Readers article opened the door to the use of hemoglobin since it is fractionated from red blood cells. This coupled with the WTS statement to the European Commission on Human Rights that their are no &quot;controls or sanctions&quot; for a Witness who accepts blood and that minors may not carry &quot;Advance Medical Directives&quot; prohibiting blood transfusions are significant indications that the WTS may significantly modify their blood policy or abandon it altogether at some point in the future. Additionally, in April of 2000 the WTS admitted that it was no longer disfellowshipping members who accepted blood or prohibited blood components.</div>

I'm reminded of a parable that I learned in church that I heard several times when I was growing up.<br />
<br />
 A man was drowning and he was praying for God to rescue him. A boat came along to rescue the drowning man. When the captain offered him his hand the drowning man said. &quot;No thanks. I am waiting for God to come and save me&quot;.<br />
 The drowning man was becoming weaker and another boat approached. &quot;Excuse me sir but do you need help?&quot; - Again the reply was &quot;No. I believe God will come and rescue me.&quot; Not long after the third boat's offer of help the man drowned.<br />
 When the man reached the pearly gates he asked God why he had abandoned him in his hour of need. &quot;I came three times to your aid but you refused each time&quot;.<br />
<br />
The moral of the parable? <br />
When someone comes along to help you out of a nasty situation dont ignore that help. If only the drowned man had not been so stubborn he would have been saved.<br />
<br />
Blood transfusions? The miracle might have been there right under their noses. But they refused to take the hand that was offered to them. <br />
<br />
If only these people were not so short sighted.</div>

		<div>I'm going to try to stay out of this one, except to say that I think folks are jumping to &quot;evil and cruel belief&quot; from &quot;unreasonable belief&quot; rather eagerly. There are things that none of us would do to survive (even for our kids), and this woman's inclusion of blood transfusion in that list doesn't make her &quot;cruel.&quot; <br />
<br />
Do we even know that she would have lived if she had accepted it? <br />
<br />
For the record, I believe it may be unreasonable, but I surely wouldn't vilify the woman for upholding her religious beliefs. One of my biggest fears growing up was that I would be forced to accept a BT. There were stories going around about doctors who would ignore your wishes and force it. It was terrifying. I think some of you may not be thinking about this objectively.<br />
<br />
(As an aside: I'd be very careful getting JW doctrinal information from any online source other than the WTS website. There is a lot of misinformation out there, as evidenced by the rumors that have been circulated lately.)</div>
