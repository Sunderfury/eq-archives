<br />
Pyromancy - 3 Ranks - Prereq: Level 78/79/80 - Cost: 9/10/12<br />
While active, the wizard focuses his mastery over fire to cause <b>any level 65 or higher</b> fire-based direct damage spell they cast to have a chance to cause the targeted creature to burst into flames, taking continual damage and becomes more susceptible to further fire-based attacks. Additional ranks increase the effectiveness of the ability and the chance for it to occur.<br />

15% chance to proc<br />
<b>Works on level 60 to 80 spells</b><br />

		<div>Ok, I have a question.<br />
<br />
Given that there are so many awesome looking AAs, is the general consensus still to level up to 80 and then get the AAs?  If so, I'm going to have to be really stingy on what I pick up with the initial 30 AAs!<br />
<br />
What are some popular theories on 'must have from the get-go' AAs?  All the agro-reduction stuff looks really nice (SCS 4-6 &amp; Hastened Silent Casting and to some extent Mind Crash 4-6) - but it doesn't seem like they will be necessary for the grind and I can live without them the first couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
What's going to help me grind to 80 and the AAs the most?  I'm thinking that I can do without a 10th spell gem or the AA invis for now (wrong? well 3 points for the AA invis sounds well worth it), and my current game plan is to power level to 80 but stop at 77 to pick up 9 points for the upgraded flappy, how does that sound?<br />
<br />
So with my initial 30 points I'd get:<br />
<br />
1) Harvest of Druzzil 2 (6 points)<br />
2) GoERM (9 points)<br />
3) Spell Casting Fury Mastery 11 (7 points)<br />
4) Spell Casting Fury Mastery 12 (9 points, so I'd have to get one more AA point)<br />
<br />
(Or, I can just get Harvest of Druzzil and 4 ranks of Quickened Harvest of Druzzil to make it a 4 minute 1.5k mana regen which sounds pretty nice... hehe)<br />
<br />
Thoughts? : )<br />

The best AAs are:<br />

Spell Casting Fury Mastery and Destructive Fury<br />

This is a very nice upgrade, it adds 13% to damage, you cannot not like that.<br />
<br />
The must haves:<br />
<br />
Gift of Exquisite Radiant Mana <br />
Harvest of Druzzil <br />
Mnemonic Retention<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety<br />
New Familiars - 35%!!!<br />
<br />
There are few others but most of the rest is fluff<br />

Mancy type AAs still do nothing for raiders and do not stack with MR. Lots of AAs.</div>

		<div>Thanks Gavrilo!  When you say best/must-have, in your opinion do you level to 80 first and then pick up the 'must haves', or pick up must-haves before moving on?<br />
<br />
My guild is taking the first week of SoF off from raiding, so I'm not going to need SCS4-6 until after that.  And I'm not sure how long it takes to level in SoF when I only have about 3-4 hours each weeknight to level (and presumably all day Saturday/Sunday) : )<br />

Can't wait can't wait can't wait can't wait : O<br />
