		<blockquote class="restore">I was excited that they were releasing the street fighter games on pc during the summer sale on steam. I'd pirated a previous version once before and it worked somewhat well on my lackluster pc that met the minimum requirements. The listed requirements for the purchased version were mostly similar and well within range.<br />
<br />
I have very fond memories of growing up and trading controllers with my friends on the neighborhood super nintendo so we could invent new ways of doing things in street figther 2. Then again in turbo edition<br />
<br />
<br />
Not so this load of extra installs and verification.<br />
<br />
I spent my scant monetary allowance on your repeated susurrant promises and you gave me windows live and so many reboots that I'm not sure whether you're speaking honestly or just faking it for the sake of the audience.<br />
<br />
I really despise spending money on duds that I don't have tha ability to fix up easily.<br />
It's a betrayal of bank.</blockquote>

These game companies act like blushing brides who give you half the combination to the locks on their chastity belts, and make it so you have to ask their fathers to dial in the other half every time you want to bang their daughters.

Anyways - sadface that your compy chokes out when playing. I don't really like the netplay screens, but meh. I don't even play this game. waste of 40 bucks maybe, since I'm more about new-school fighters.<br />
<br />
GFWL not really a great platform - it always seems invasive and hard to navigate.</blockquote>

</div>Nah.<br />
I picked up a used laptop that has the same processor speed as my desktop only it's dual core.<br />
<br />
One core runs the game just like it should be run, the other core is all GFWL, taking up almost 100%.<br />
I think it's literally monitoring every microsecond of the game to ensure no online cheating goes on, kinda like diablo 3 tries to do.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">capcom builds their games on pc then down scales em to the consoles. one of the few companies that do it probably the only reason we get fighters occasionally for the pc <br />
<br />
also the reason most companies use GFWL is it makes the port easier to do for i think online games. im not a fan of it but it doesnt effect my pc any and get  achivments <br />
<br />
lastly street fighter ae runs fine on my pc and i cut down on my xbox use by 50% because of it. i'll tell you though i had a lot of stuttering issues with darksiders 2. i tried a few programs(except afterburner) and some guy on a forum found 3 nivida settings that fixed most of the issue. ports these days are often not 100% for every system.  :)</blockquote>
