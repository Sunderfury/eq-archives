		<div>I am sure parses will come, most guilds are taking a break from raiding to let people level and such.<br />
<br />
It will take a little time to sort out the numbers. For high end raider question becomes how far can our high DPS strats be extend . If they prove too expensive to be usefull in most situations you will see a lot of unhappy wizards.<br />
<br />
We are limited by 3 nukes and if we have to step away from that DPS takes a dive.<br />
<br />
We also come off TSS/TBS where wizards ruled, we have very high expectations and for good reason.<br />
<br />
From Beta chatter I can tell you that rogs and necros are looking for substantial upgrade to DPS. I thought that our 4k burn strat (60 sec fights) was great untill necros told me they can burn for 4k now. This is all very much preliminary and I am not sure who is putting what in numbers.<br />
<br />
I am disapointed with SoF, I think it is a bad expansion for wizards. I am taking a little break atm and I will not be much help. So I am watching you all for clues.</div>

		<div>dont have any good parses for beta raids because the spells changed around 3 days to launch. prathun didn't add stuff like decent resist checks to ecs, tss <br />
spell revamp(many thought he wasn't even going to do that), and instant resources till about last Friday.<br />
<br />
 also solteris focus effects didn't change till about  month ago so further offsets the parses. speaking of focus, the new ones were rolling almost max most of the time  too which messed up allot of  parses while that bug was in. so most parses before last friday are pretty much botched.</div>

<br />
Parse of the clear to Beltron from Harfange. Another mostly useless parse, but the interesting bit is 1) I beat le pallies! (top 5 is 1 wizard, 4 pallies) 2) It's sustainable dmg, I ended clear with 70 pct mana. <br />
<br />
As mentioned, I have subpar focus gear, so add another 20-25ish pct to the overall dmg and I'm guessing you are where lvl 75 spells can now take you with CI/Soth/FF, EC on GoRM, bard playing new pyrotech+aria and aura.<br />
<br />
All in all, from the clear above and a group I had yesterday, I'd say sustained dps is around 2k for TSS geared toons at lvl 75. Dunno if that's more, less or same as before revamp?</div>

You're time on the parse comes out to 8.2 minutes for the 1350dps shown.  Varakx time comes out to 9.9 minutes.   Need to know what the actual total time was, instead of just what Yalp picked up for each person.<br />

At best, using 10 minutes for total time, your damage comes out to 1100 total, and I'd guess probably a bit lower than that in the 1000-1050ish range probably unless Varakx didn't have any downtime at all between mobs.<br />

The parse is shit, yes, main point is that it's sustainable. No matter what it evens out at, I did more dmg than the paladins, who usually rule on the undead clears (and place near top in boss fights, usually), and could have kept going. Improvement. Substantial even.<br />

If you are trying to support changes to our spells this is not going to help your cause. <br />

If you like what SoF brought your class you can argue that Prathun is a genius or that this is your preference and it suits you better. Simple fact is that most of wizards, those that like and dislike this change, will not use sustain metrics as an argument.</div>

Actually, there's already been plenty of people claiming it to be higher dps, I'm missing the parses though. I personally haven't done a burn fight yet, since the change. When I do, I'm more than likely to be parsing it, and since I'll post one such to guild, might as well post it here as well.<br />
<br />
However many wizards cry over the loss of their instants, doesn't change the fact that we had a spell revamp. People should be showing us why it sucks, not claiming it repeatedly on a messageboard with acid rich bile dripping from their posts. Alot of us weren't in beta, we cannot see all the proof/parses that was posted there.</div>

There is not much I can say that will change your mind. I have written a lot of stuff and I have explained at nauseam what bothers me about the changes and how and why they have been implemented. You have looked at few posts that give you numbers that are situational and called me angry and resentful.

Here's another one liner just for you:<br />
<br />
lol@Gavrilo<br />
<br />
@Kela, read the part where I said that the important bit was that I could sustain it :p Pallies = AFK dmg and they've been topping parses on clears easily since we started FC, which is why I liked the fact that I moved past them. I wasn't comparing the dmg to anyone else on the clear. I know they werne't doing their best, it's a given, it's a clear :p But again, pallies = AFK dmg.<br />

November parse post-SoF: 1967 dps<br />
<br />
In all fairness, I only parse myself.  I only do this to tweak my casting and assure myself that I am &quot;being all I can be&quot;.  So far, there are not enough points on this one encounter I chose to highlight to make an issue about dps being affected - except for one thing.  There is a parse posted by the guild on this fight, so not only do I get to see my own parses - I get to see how it compares to others in the guild.<br />
<br />
My dps went from being top, or first, to 5th.  While my parse remained essentially the same, with maybe some drop (again, not enough points to ascertain) - several others boosted parse dramatically.  I am happy for the zerkers and rogues who got this boost, it makes our guild that much stronger.  I am not happy that anyone could beat a wizard on burst dps - it is our role.<br />
<br />
For reference, parses include maximum use of wands, early parses included an AA harvest, where you see the parses jump includes use of a Kiss.  Pre-nerf parses ended with me just reaching, or very close to being oom.  The post nerf parse, I used the Kiss, and ended the fight with 42% mana.  This is a fairly long fight for burst dps - and it amazes me while saddening me that wizards can't make use of a full bar of mana + boosts, because this means - we are not the burst dps the class was designed for.  Since it is early yet in this expansion's release, expect our dps to drop even more dramatically compared to melee gains once people have factions done and enter zones with higher end gear.  Our new spells and our new AAs will in no way match the gains experienced by melee, sorry to say.  Before the next release (next year), expect to see wizards being mid-range dps at best in comparison to all other classes.<br />
<br />
Any of you remember GoD?  Tipt?  Being excluded because we were not considered &quot;useful&quot; or &quot;essential&quot;?  I never want to see that again, but there is a lot of potential of seeing us fall off consideration for groups, missions, due to becoming less desired over any other class LFG.  The true damage of this nerf is yet to be felt, but it's coming.</div>

				First of all I can't figure out why the forums won't allow my EQ players's sig... other people have it, tells me mine is too large.<br />
<br />
Anyways... RF is a lovely gem. With Envenomed Blades + Frenzied, its a deadly combination for outputting some massive damage.<br />
<br />
On a recent parse for orc in event 3 Solteris, just after getting level 80 and have rank 3 of RF and rank 1 of Envenomed Blades, I put out 4769 dps. Prior to the goodies SoF brought us, with same gear as I have currently mind you, I was pushing at around 3k max dps. Now I am not very high end geared really, no solt weps, just Ember and cudgel from TSS, so I don't do huge damage anyways, but for me and I think for anyone, thats a NICE increase. Other rogue in my guild managed 6.2k dps as well...<br />
<br />
Happy hunting with this one rogues!

Im not too concerned with the casting changes, but im struggling to see how we're going to keep up?<br />
The above isn't an awful lot of info, we dont know what the rogs did or didnt use, but the poster was seeing a 60% increase just for hitting 80 and a few AAs. Though sustained wont see that much as alot is to do with their new aa disc.<br />

		<div>I've done two full days of raiding now and have already shared my experiences with Qaman, Gavrillo, and a few others - but figure I can add some food for thought.<br />
<br />
I come from the guild that's not super uber.  We're the furthest progression on our server, but we're not high on dps classes (only 2ish berserkers, 4ish rogues), and we traditionally conquored end game content based on survivability above all else.  Our parses look absolutely nothing like what the top dogs out there post.  Pre-SoF, 2700 DPS on a 3ish to 3 1/2 minute Solt 2 orc run will always win the top slot.  My personal best with 7th + Kiss was 2900 dps (without Glyph).<br />
<br />
Wizards are almost always grouped together with a Bard (but as I don't play a bard or understand what they're doing, no clue on the gimpyness or l33t-ness of the bard).  Once upon a time MR was always on, but lately we only have ~2 enchanters show up a raid and there's not enough to go around.<br />
<br />
My choice of spells at the moment are MAGIC because the only useful Rk II I have is Tangleweave Energy 2, and Cloudburst Bolt is Level 77 so I figure it's ok.  My casting cycle when 7th year is up is to chain CBB/CBS.  Use CBB/CBS accordingly when GoERM/GoRM pops up, with priority for GoERM going on CBB (even if I have to wait .5 second) of course, and obviously only cast CBS if I get a GoRM off another CBS. Once 7th is down, I switch between Tangleweave 2 and CBB 1 with using EI when GoERM goes off.  If I miscalculate mana, I go to TW2 and WMS2, and adapt GoERM/GoRMs accordingly.  I have TSS focuses (x to level 75).  [Critiques on my casting cycles pleasE?]<br />
<br />
I have 7th &amp; Kiss, top rogue does not have 7th.  2 other wizards has 7th, not sure about other rogues.<br />
<br />
Ok end background info.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Saturday - Solteris.<br />
<br />
Solt 1 - didn't bother analyze the parse anymore as it's trivial.  I remember glancing over it and Christine went Pal Wiz Wiz Wiz Wiz or something like that.  The paladin part befuddled me a bit, but what can ya do about undeads.  Our melee dps don't get to dps to their heart's content so it's not like this was surprising.<br />
<br />
Solt 2 - Orc went down to like 156 seconds or something like that.  Parse went <br />
<br />
Wiz <br />
Rogue <br />
Rogue <br />
Rogue <br />
Beast <br />
Rogue <br />
Wiz <br />
Rogue <br />
Wiz <br />
Wiz<br />
<br />
Only total damage was posted for this and I don't remember the #, but I think the dps translates to like 3300 dps for the top.  The fact that we had no berserkers at this raid bothered me a bit as melees would have had much more dps, but what's more disturbing is that on all previous runs pre-SoF it went Wiz Wiz Zerker Wiz Wiz Zerker Rogue Beast Wiz Rogue Rogue Rogue (we have an EXCEPTIONAL Beastlord) and now it seems our wizards as a class is getting it handed to us versus the Rogues.  <br />
<br />
I somewhat expect this to put a long story short I don't feel it's a fair competitive playing field until we get some new focuses and our useful Rank 2s, which benefits us on a relative level far more than melees.   So I'm ok with losing at this point (ideally casters lose right now until they get R2 &amp; Focuses and then they pull ahead and then Melees get SoF weapons and then we can see the real test).<br />
<br />
Aprosis parse was like Melee Melee Melee Wiz Melee Melee Melee Wiz Melee Melee or something like that, but I think that's largely because our casters only burn 100-&gt;73 and 40-&gt;0.<br />
<br />
As Kela says Solt 3 is the anti-wizard event so I'm not bothered by the parse on that one. : )  For dignity's sake, let's not get into it.<br />
<br />
So far, so good.  Slightly gloomy, but not as dark as others have been saying.<br />
<br />
Sunday - Bloodmoon Keep<br />
<br />
Bloodmoon Keep 6 Event 1<br />
<br />
Not the most magic friendly mob but I went with the same cycle anyway since we're still in experimental mode.<br />
<br />
Parse went:<br />
<br />
Wiz/Rogue (on one parse he beat me by 3k, on another parse I beat him by 3k, we'll call it even)<br />
Rogue<br />
Rogue<br />
Rogue<br />
Beast<br />
Wiz<br />
Wiz<br />
....<br />
<br />
The list starts getting kind of odd towards the end, with a Magician moving up a few slots to knock down some Rangers/Monks.<br />
<br />
Again I'm very distrubed as this was a zerker-less event and I'm using 7th year while the top rogue wasn't.  And the fact is I have to wait 4 hours before I can do the same DPS and he will be ready by the next boss.  In an all else equal scenario, I'd have lost big if he had 7th.  Maybe I'll try fire next time other wizards reported fire landed just fine.<br />
<br />
Bloodmoon Keep 6 Event 2:<br />
<br />
I was coordinating the balance, and shifting targets constantly, so I did not even bother looking at the parse.  Actually, I don't even remember one posted.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I did not check the parses on Bloodmoon Keep 7 because I was too tired.  But the top rogue told me that I was top dps on the final mob - none of us used any major discs.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
So... what's my conclusion?  I'm slightly more optimistic than I was before.  Time will tell but off the bat we definitely took a plunge as a class.  It's time to temporarily accept Rogue as the top consistent burn dps and see what the future tuning/spell upgrades/focus upgrades will do for us to put us back at a fair competitive field.<br />
<br />
Hope this info helps in some way.<br />

After we spoke I got numbers from my own guild. I was not there but on Orc, all rogs came on top with 550-650k total on 120 sec fight. Not 1 Solteris weapon but all have TSS weapons. Zerker came in at 470k, he is still using 2.5 so he will get up there soon. Wiz were not even close. Top rog may have used 7th but most of the 6 there do not even have it.</div>

(on the other hand, our dps class consists at Orc that day consisted of 5 Rogues, 0 Berserkers, 5 Wizards, and misc other ones.  It's not your typical 2+ Zerker 7+ Rogue X Wizards, etc.  I don't know if comparing guild to guild's dps is apples to apples, from Day 1 I've been more concerned with how our wizards stack versus our guild, as the dps I do in the end is only a function of my total damage, guild's total damage, and how that effects overall length of fight).  Our fights are longer than any other guilds I know of that can clear Solt 2.</div>

(by the way, I crunched the #s with I think it was Qaman pre-SoF?  Possibly with another notable math-type wizard from here.  With a parse I had and the guild's dps, it was tough for thereoretical dps on Solt 2 orc for me to get over 2900 DPS.  It's not possible for me to do much more DPS pre-SoF when I'm already chaining two instants none stop and using Kiss and never running out of mana during the orc phase.  If my guild's dps doesn't increase, my doesn't).  I'd not say if it's with ease.  I'm sure we all understand that a wizard in a massive dps guild will inherently get his/her dps boosted solely by the decrease of time in the event.  That's why it's relative DPS that makes a difference, not actual.  Comparing my dps to say Kela's dps and my would be laughable (maybe cuz I'm gimp).  Comparing my dps to the highest rogue's dps and comparing Kela's dps to her highest rogue, would reveal better information.<br />

		<div>Welp, finally managed to attend a few semi-worthy parse fights this saturday. Three Brothers and Grenwald. Oh, hi, Gav og Kela, yes, Three Brothers isn't ideal, but numbers were cross checked with rogue parsing and they matched :) And Grenwald himself is a burn-fight for us, supposing that's standard for others as well at that point.<br />

Zerker  335063  1159,39<br />
Ranger 327866  1170,95<br />
<br />
My my, that is some crappy formating, but female is calling from bed, so will have to make it quick :p<br />
<br />
Bottom zerker in first parse didn't use any discs, didn't ask why. Rogue that shows up in Grenwald was at Three Brothers as well, but FD/stunned alot of the time, appearently :p<br />
<br />
Anyway... worth noting... all say for top wizard (in both parses) were level 80. Said wizard was 78 and using rk. III TSS spells only with ~14k buffed mana pool, no vet AA or other tricks used and Vamp Fire only (Got arms from Grenwald though, woo woo). Wasn't an ideal parse, seeing as I got a call midway through Three Brothers and noticed I'd forgotten to mem WMS :p And during Grenwald I messed up at least once (fizzled EC, wtb fix), when chatting :p Said chat also causing me to start a lil late with mana-dumping, meaning I ended fight with ~30m.<br />
<br />
Okay, more calls, most go :p</div>

<br />
My concern is now more concentrated on my dps without said nifty tricks because well, that's more like 90% of the encounters each day.<br />

		<div>Rogs are obliterating everyone, it is likely they will get the axe sooner or later. Zerkers are lagging behind but still do better than us with good weapons. Monks are going to be closer to us or even better once they get newer weapons. For some reason Necros are not parsing well. I have a feeling they have similar issues like us in that current mana pools cannot support current spells.</div>

		<div>as a  formal rogue i think their current dps is about where it should be, well except for bursting but thats been a running problem since gates when the old spell dev screwed everything up unlinking discs. just find it funny nerfs are called when someone finds something their ahead at like being able to do a quest fast with porting or being able to inv past stuff or being able to nuke while running. main problem is devs should be helping the classes that are behind and they been falling short of that for a long long time. :)</div>

Nerfing isn't bad, unless it's uncalled for. If 6-7k dps per dps toon is what it takes for a full raid to beat SoF encounters, fair enough that the dps is up there. If it takes 5k dps per dps toon, I do not agree that nerfing 6-7k dps toons isn't warranted (I'd even hope it was done). On the other hand, if other dps toons can't produce the 5k required, they should be beefed up... not because someone else can do 6-7k, but because the content is meant for them to be doing 5k. <br />
<br />
Yes yes, amazingly messy :p I get my point though!</div>

That sounds about right in terms of how far ahead rogues can get.  I think the margin might be a little bit smaller if a glyph is used (which nobody is using right now).<br />
<br />
Non 7th year OBLITERATING 7th year isn't okay with me.  I realize that 7th year doesn't do nearly as much for rogues as it does for other classes but if we can't even compare to them when using it, balance is drastically wrong.<br />
<br />
This is just THE BEGINNING.  We will get a small upgrade when all of our rank 3s are obtained.  We may even get a little kick out of these heroic stats.....but rogues (and berserkers) may as well have a mile head start on us since they'll be getting bigger upgrades as time passes.<br />
<br />
I'm not interested in nerfing other classes, what I AM interested in is staying competitive with them.  This is why I've gotten so upset when people start praising these new spell changes like they've given us some sort of huge gift.</div>

I haven't had time to follow all the talk lately, but it seems to me that people generally agree (or at least fear) that we'll get screwed in the end. That doesn't mean, to me at least, that we aren't allowed to enjoy the revamped spells and maybe even utter some form of fondness for it. I like them better than what we had before. I'm not saying they solved our problems, at least it doesn't appear that way for upper end wizards, but to me they were a step in the right direction. <br />
<br />
I probably think this, because I've always been in favor of a discs driven system, rather than a entirely spell-based system (as we have now). I'd rather they fixed PD (both the bug and the suckiness) and gave us one or two other discs, than see them simply retune the spells. But it seems dps discs just isn't supposed to be in the wizard repetoire.</div>

		<div>In my opinion people are lumping together two issues that should be completely separate.  Obviously we can't compare them directly with parses but calculations at least show that the new system is approximately equal to the old for burst and is better for sustained.  The real problem is that our spells have not been sufficiently upgraded to match melee upgrades.  Do you think our spells would have been upgraded more if we hadn't gotten the new system? I certainly don't.</div>

		<div>How will you pull out 6k DPS DC? Thats 48k dmagae over 8 second cycle. That's minimum what is needed to be on par with rog atm. Their damage is more or less equaly spread over those 8 sec, yours comes in chunks. You will generate much higher agro. There is no way we can get there just thru bigger nukes. We need more than 1 or 2 nukes in that timeframe and we need base damage to stay relatively low. We either need bigger crits or better chance to crit or both, only disk will do that.</div>
