			<description><![CDATA[Any chance we can get the thread "Watch Free Birds Online And Download Bad Grandpa Movie" nuked from the General Games section?  It looks like you dealt with the spammer but my OCD is kicking in hardcore when I see that subforum has unread messages. 
 
Thanks!]]></description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This has been going on for a while, since we did the last major forum migration (year? two years? ago).<br />
<br />
Define page as X posts, where X is 50 for me (I think).<br />
<br />
When a page loads, the link or anchor jumps to the appropriate place. Usually, this is &quot;first unread post&quot; for the links that I click.<br />
<br />
While the page is rendering/loading, the anchor point is -lost- as the browser jumps up and down as images are loaded. Then, at the end, the page realigns so the anchor is at the top of the page...<br />
<br />
Unless there is someone blocked on the page, then the difference in page length is subtracted (?) from the anchor location, scrolling the page to somewhere else. As you might expect, multiple posts on a single page from a blocked user causes the anchor point to be largely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
This is a nuisance for two reasons:<br />
1 - someone I have intentionally and selectively ignored is now impacting my browsing (damnit! *shakes fist*), and they didn't even have to take action :hammer::hammer: and<br />
2 - using the forums in a &quot;read newest unread&quot; method is more or less ruined, because the page jumps off to who-knows-where.<br />
<br />
Is this something we can affect with the site code, or is this buried in some functional interpretation that we don't have access to?<br />
<br />
The result is reproduced in the browsers I've tried (Chrome, Firefox, IE) on the desktop, all current/up-to-date.<br />
<br />
Viewing the forums through tapatalk does not seem to create this issue, that I can tell.</div>
