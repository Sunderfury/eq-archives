Got no traction from the Render team in the form of help to start debugging it. They only said &quot;just go find out when it broke&quot; (yea thanks assholes!). Fine... I did some research, first known report was pre-thanksgiving. We get +1000 code checkins a day plus a few times that in the form of asset changes (art, fx, animations etc). <br />
<br />
I took a wild stab 2 weeks back and wala, visible objects! Ok, thats not so bad, thats a window of 8 days... hmmm wait, thats 8ish thousand code checkins. So I scroll around in the history midway between those two dates, looking for things that look render related. Rebase, pull matching content... THIRTY MINUTES of building later I test. Broken. Ok repeat going back to another older checkin, rebase, pull matching content, build... THIRTY MINUTES of building, test ... GodDamnit still broken. <br />
<br />
SonOfABitch. Did that for 6 hours... FINALLY Tracked that POS bug down to a rediculously stupid chunk of code someone pushedup. I was wound pretty tight by this point so I'm sure my email to him came across rather scathing. Such a waste of time... grrrr!</div>
