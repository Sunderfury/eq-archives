And this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_privacy#United_States" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Right To Privacy</a><br />

<br />
So, you have lots and lots of methane bubbles and cavitation from them imploding and reforming all the time, ie, micro-shocks<br />
And it's the incredible pressure and cold that keeps those gasses dissolved and the clathrates solid.<br />

Remember those lakes that, &quot;over turned&quot;?<br />

if you have enough of an upwelling, it will be kind of like, oh grabbing a bed sheet in the middle and lifting it up, you'll end up sucking up a huge area as the ocean is in &quot;layers&quot; in effect, and as you lift one area <i>up</i>....<br />

Profile of an immigration campaign creating a climate of fear<br />
<br />
<br />
The Guardian, Tuesday 6 August 2013 21.00 BST	<br />
<br />
<br />
Home Office 'Go home' van <br />

<br />
<br />
We are writing to express our concern about recent government initiatives against irregular immigration (Report, 3 August). The most recent of these include the &quot;Go Home&quot; van campaign, which echoes the National Front graffiti slogans in the 1970s; and the immigration raids on tube stations in poor, mixed urban areas, which, according to Doreen Lawrence and eyewitness accounts, have involved racial profiling.<br />
<br />
Proposals to require tourists from six Asian and African countries to pay a £3,000 bond; to charge non-EU migrants for healthcare; and to require private landlords to check the immigration status of prospective tenants also open the door to discrimination and abuse. These initiatives, combined with their promotion through inflammatory language on Twitter, represent an increasing politicisation of Home Office policy, where fears about immigration are exploited for a hoped-for electoral gain, while creating a climate of fear for migrants and people of colour.<br />
<br />
We condemn and demand the withdrawal of these ill-thought-out and reactionary initiatives. We believe they may incite racism and intolerance and reverse the progress that has been made by previous generations towards equality. It is with great urgency that we ask the government to review its approach to immigration policy. We also call on others to join us in this condemnation of current government policy.<br />

<br />
 While there is a need for more accurate figures on immigration and its effects, there is a more urgent prior need for some sort of consensus on what figures are relevant, and what accuracy they need to mean anything. Without that, alarmists and extremists on the both sides will continue to cherry-pick the data, exaggerate the significance of those figures that suit them and play down the significance of those that do not (Editorial, 2 August). Time frames will be chosen, factors included and excluded, to bias the figures towards a desired result.<br />
<br />
I talk of sides, and here lies the hurdle. The debate is left too much to the extremes. There are xenophobes and scapegoaters on one side, and on the other those who hold that anything short of no controls at all is to be xenophobic. The hysteria of each feeds the other's fears. Reasonable people are cowed into silence. We need to redraw the battle lines for the goal of a sane discussion.<br />
Christopher Padley<br />
Lincoln<br />
<br />
<br />
 Why does the government have such a manic hostility to migrants and yet appoint mainly migrants to senior positions? It has appointed a Canadian as governor of the Bank of England, a New Zealander who failed his accountancy exams as head of the publicly owned RBS, an Australian lobbyist as head of Tory electoral strategy and an American as his deputy. Does Mr Cameron know the meaning of hypocrisy? And if no British banker is good enough for those senior positions, why are they paid so much? <br />

			Immigrant spot checks: Equality watchdog investigatesImmigration raids on 1 August 2013 Immigration enforcement officers arrested 139 suspected illegal immigrants on Thursday Continue reading the main story <br />

<br />
Immigration spot checks at railway stations across the country are to be investigated by the equality watchdog for possible unlawful discrimination.<br />
<br />
This follows reported complaints that the checks, carried out on Thursday, targeted people based on ethnicity.<br />
<br />
The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would examine the powers used and their &quot;justification&quot;. <br />
<br />
Immigration Minister Mark Harper denied the checks used racial profiling. He said they were based on intelligence.<br />
<br />
A spokesman for the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said it would also &quot;ask questions about the extent to which the Home Office complied with its public sector equality duty&quot; when vans were sent around London encouraging illegal immigrants to &quot;go home&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rick Jones, of charity Refugee Action, said: &quot;Where's the evidence that creating this hostile environment actually works and will create the environment where people will engage with the government and go home?&quot;<br />
<br />
He added: &quot;We need to treat people with respect and dignity and not vilify people.&quot;<br />
<br />
As well as the spot checks at transport hubs, there were raids on workplaces on Thursday.<br />
<br />
A Home Office spokesman said there were a total of 160 arrests, 21 of which were at stations in London. <br />
<br />
The other 139 suspected illegal immigrants and rogue employers were arrested at locations across the country including London, Durham, Manchester, Wales and Somerset.<br />
<br />
'Reasonable suspicion'<br />
 <br />
The Home Office said there had been 228 immigration street operations since 2008 and there were 9,000 arrests in the past year for suspected immigration abuse.<br />
<br />
An EHRC spokesman said it was writing to the Home Office about the checks at transport hubs.<br />
<br />
He said the EHRC &quot;will be examining the powers used and the justification for them, in order to assess whether unlawful discrimination took place&quot;. <br />
<br />
Doreen Lawrence, who was confirmed this week as a Labour peer, said: &quot;I'm sure there's illegal immigrants from all countries, but why would you focus that on people of colour, and I think racial profiling is coming into it.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Mr Harper said the operations had been &quot;based on intelligence and reasonable suspicion&quot;.<br />
<br />
Home Office van bearing the slogan &quot;In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest&quot; There had been strong criticism of the vans telling illegal immigrants to &quot;go home&quot; <br />
&quot;We don't just stop people at random,&quot; he said, describing the series of arrests as &quot;lawful and proportionate&quot;.<br />
<br />
He later said the street operations &quot;involved immigration officers talking to people in the local area and, where there was a reason to do so, asking questions in relation to immigration status&quot;. <br />
<br />
He added: &quot;Although we do not often run these kinds of operations, it is not a new way of working. We have used these tactics effectively over many years.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Harper said he was confident immigration officers had complied with guidance, which says they must not stop people based on their race and colour but must have &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that someone has committed an immigration offence.<br />
<br />
The guidance says street operations are designed to &quot;target immigration offenders where intelligence has shown that they are gathered at specific locations at certain times&quot;.<br />
<br />
Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said he had written to the home secretary questioning the basis on which the arrests were made. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is in everyone's interest to combat illegal immigration but profiling is not acceptable and should not be happening under any circumstances,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Operations need to be intelligence-led, not based on ethnicity.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Home Office's own guidance says that an immigration officer can only stop somebody if they have intelligence to say that that person may be an illegal immigrant, said Mr Bryant.<br />
<br />
Mr Bryant said the government had released the figure of 160 arrests to look tough on immigration, but he said Home Secretary Theresa May had &quot;refused so far&quot; to say how many people were stopped. <br />
<br />
UKIP leader Nigel Farage, whose party wants less immigration into the UK, said the government was &quot;panicking&quot; and trying to &quot;sort the problem out in an overly fast and heavy handed manner&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it feels as if what is basically happening is that they are going to some parts of the country and stopping every person with a black face, then that is totally unacceptable,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
The Unite union said earlier it was seeking legal advice about whether the &quot;go home&quot; vans had &quot;incited racial hatred&quot;. <br />
<br />
General Secretary Len McCluskey said: &quot;This is a vile act by a government that demeans its office by scrabbling around in the gutter with these stunts. This must not be rolled out nationwide, as some have suggested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Labour peer Lord Lipsey has reported the posters to the Advertising Standards Authority.<br />
<br />
The BBC revealed on Thursday how two-thirds of fines imposed on employers of illegal workers had been uncollected in the past five years, with only £25m of the £80m of fines issued collected<br />

			Barrister criticised for calling child abuse victim 'predatory'Snaresbrook Crown Court  The case was heard at Snaresbrook Crown Court <br />
The Crown Prosecution Service has criticised one of its own barristers for referring to a 13-year-old sex abuse victim as &quot;predatory&quot;.<br />
<br />
Robert Colover QC also called the girl &quot;sexually experienced&quot;. The CPS said his language had been &quot;inappropriate&quot;.<br />
<br />
Neil Wilson, 41, admitted abusing the girl at his home in Romford, London, and was given a suspended jail term.<br />
<br />
The Attorney General's Office said the sentence had been drawn to its attention as &quot;possibly unduly lenient&quot;.<br />
<br />
The police were alerted to the actions of Wilson, who now lives in York, after his victim had told a friend. Images of child sex abuse were also found on Wilson's computer.<br />
<br />
Wilson later admitted two counts of making extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child.<br />
<br />
Mr Colover, who was representing the CPS at Wilson's sentencing hearing at London's Snaresbrook Crown Court on Monday, said: &quot;The girl is predatory in all her actions and she is sexually experienced.&quot;<br />
<br />
The judge, Nigel Peters, said that when deciding Wilson's punishment, he had taken into account the prosecution's comments that the girl looked and behaved older than she was. Wilson's eight-month jail term was suspended for two years.<br />
<br />
Speaking about Mr Colover's remarks, a CPS spokesman said: &quot;The language used by prosecution counsel was inappropriate.<br />
<br />
&quot;The transgressor in this case was the defendant and he bears responsibility for his criminal acts.&quot; <br />
<br />
Online petition<br />
 <br />
In a statement, the Attorney General's Office said: &quot;The case has been drawn to the attention of this office as a possibly unduly lenient sentence.<br />
<br />
&quot;This means it'll be considered by a law officer (the Attorney or Solicitor General) who will decide whether it should be referred to the Court of Appeal under the unduly lenient sentence scheme.&quot;<br />
<br />
It said a decision would be announced once files relating to the case had been considered.<br />
<br />
Alison Worsley, of children's charity Barnardo's, said: &quot;It is plain wrong to imply in any way that the experiences of sexually exploited children are something they bring on themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is difficult to imagine the torment experienced by the vulnerable victims of crimes such as these.&quot;<br />
<br />
She added: &quot;It takes immense bravery for these young people to relive their ordeal in a court of law and we must not forget that it is the abuser who is guilty and not the victim.&quot;<br />
<br />
More than 4,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the CPS to investigate the language used by Mr Colover.<br />
<br />
The petition, which was started by a woman named Jo who described herself as a &quot;survivor of childhood sexual abuse&quot;, stated: &quot;It's unacceptable that the crown prosecutor - the person who this young girl was relying on to help get her justice - used this kind of language in court. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's a sad fact that this kind of attitude is commonplace within society and the legal establishment. We need to make a stand and send a clear message: It's never the child's fault.&quot;

Brandon M. Toy: Resignation Letter from a Soldier<br />
<br />
<br />
Brandon Toy resigned his job working for US defense contractor General Dynamics as an Engineering Project Manager building Stryker armored fighting vehicles on July 16, 2013. Previously, Brandon served in the Michigan Army National Guard as a Multiple Launch Rocket System Fire Direction Specialist, Team Leader and Vehicle Commander. He was deployed as a military policeman to Baghdad, Iraq in 2004 - 2005.<br />
<br />
I hereby resign in protest effective immediately.<br />
<br />
I have served the post-911 Military Industrial complex for 10 years, first as a soldier in Baghdad, and now as a defense contractor.<br />
<br />
I have always believed that if every foot soldier threw down his rifle war would end. I hereby throw mine down.At the time of my enlistment, I believed in the cause. I was ignorant, naïve, and misled. The narrative, professed by the state, and echoed by the mainstream press, has proven false and criminal. We have become what I thought we were fighting against.<br />
<br />
Recent revelations by fearless journalists of war crimes including counterinsurgency dirty wars, drone terrorism, the suspension of due process, torture, mass surveillance, and widespread regulatory capture have shed light on the true nature of the current US Government. I encourage you to read more about these topics at the links I have provided below.<br />
<br />
Some will say that I am being irresponsible, impractical, and irrational. Others will insist that I am crazy. I have come to believe that the true insanity is doing nothing. As long as we sit in comfort, turning a blind eye to the injustices of the world, nothing will change. It is even worse to play an active part, protesting all along that I am not the true criminal.<br />
<br />
I was only a foot soldier, and am now a low level clerk. However, I have always believed that if every foot soldier threw down his rifle war would end. I hereby throw mine down.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />

<br />
  <b>August 6 Content Release Notes</b><br />
<br />
 <b>LIVING WORLD</b><br />
<b>Queens Jubilee</b><br />
A celebration to commemorate ten years of Queen Jennahs rule is about  to kick off in Divinitys Reach! The queen has commissioned a new  gladiatorial arena for the occasionthe Crown Pavilionas a shining  symbol of her peoples endurance. Take a hot air balloon ride with  dignitaries from across Tyria to the capital of the Krytan nation, and  be there for the opening ceremony. Join in the festivities and compete  in ceremonial combat in Her Majestys honor!<br />
 <b>Hot Air Balloons</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">The queens court has sent out hot air balloons to transport celebrants! Look for balloon towers all over Tyria.</li><li style="">Ascend to the top of a balloon tower to claim a royal gift before embarking on the journey to Divinitys Reach.</li><li style="">Watch for all-new dynamic events as the balloon pilots may need help keeping everything running smoothly.</li><li style="">A special hot air balloon souvenir will be given to players who are festive enough to visit 30 towers.</li></ul><br />
 <b>The Crown Pavilion</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">The arts district in Divinitys Reach that was destroyed by the  Great Collapse has been rebuilt into the Crown Pavilion, a grand arena  that will host Krytas biggest events.</li><li style="">Enter the Queens Gauntlet to battle mighty representations of humanitys most vicious enemies.</li><li style="">Visit the emissaries from six major nations of Tyria. A unique set  of boons to improve magic find and combat stats will be available to  those who wish to represent the emissaries.</li><li style="">Earn Watchwork Sprockets, a new trophy from the Watchknights, to  purchase rewards from the emissaries.

 <b>The Queens Gauntlet</b><br />
 <br />

Tickets  drop regularly from creatures in the Crown Pavilion and around the  world. Players may also purchase tickets from the emissaries in the  Crown Pavilion.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Opening Ceremony</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Witness the unveiling of the Crown Pavilion in a brand new Living  World story instance featuring familiar faces such as Queen Jennah,  Logan Thackeray, Countess Anise, Lord Faren, Rox, and Braham.</li><li style="">Rumors are running high that the queen will be taking volunteers  for the inaugural contest with the Watchknights. Theres no telling who  might show up!</li><li style="">Enter the instanced area simply by visiting the Crown Pavilion for the first time.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Beacons of Kryta</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Find torchbearers around Divinitys Reach to activate a special time-limited race to light several beacons around the city.</li><li style="">Successfully complete all four torch runs to earn the Flames of  Kryta, a permanent item that can be used to illuminate the players path  through darkness.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Achievements</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">A rotation of Living World achievements has been added to the Daily Achievement category.</li><li style="">Completing the Queens Jubilee meta-achievement awards the player a  Mini Watchknight. Completing this meta-achievement requires players to  complete 18 achievements from either the Queens Jubilee category or the  jubilee-related dailies.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Exotic Drop</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Play Queens Jubilee content for a chance at the exotic Watchwork Portal Device recipe.</li><li style="">The recipe requires a level 400 artificer. It requires 5 Orichalcum  Ingots, 1 Master Tuning Crystal, 1 Charged Lodestone, and 75 Watchwork  Sprockets.</li><li style="">The Watchwork Portal Device is a one-time use consumable that  allows players to create a portal between two points. It cannot be used  in conjunction with the mesmers portal.</li></ul><br />

 *Improved Effects Culling<br />
*<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>went there with my East Coast folks last week, was really good time, though my legs were killing me, omg! :P  (was very hot day thankfully so I wasn't so bad but going DOWN stairs is a killer for me and castles have lots of stairs, gah! :P)<br />
<br />
can't post attachments for some damn reason, sigh, got few nice pics of the castle and folks<br />
anyway well worth a visit if you love history, fantasy etc :)~<br />
I think they should film some &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; scenes there!<br />
<br />
has huge number of amazing tapestries, you can appreciate why ye old time Vikings, pirates etc stole such because they took years to make and were very expensive<br />
<br />
<br />
the main building has incredibly ornate ceilings, as it was a royal palace for the &quot;James&quot; (Stewart) kings<br />
most ceilings have wonderful carved wooden busts of people and mythical creatures<br />
<br />
Pics from Flickr, not my own<br />

some great pics there of the castle and the tapestries<br />
<br />
note, the national animal for Scotland is...the Unicorn :P Hence it's so prominent on tapestries, and heraldry<br />
very appropriate, IMHO. Ok, so I'm a mad Celt at heart :grinyes:<br />

			In Celtic Mythology the Unicorn of Scotland symbolized innocence and purity, healing powers, joy and even life itself. It was also seen as a symbol of masculinity and power. Two sides of the same coin as it were, a blend of male virility and female nurturing - perhaps the perfect mix! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other countries and cultures also recognized the Unicorn and believed in its' incredible powers. <br />
<br />
It was thought of as a wild, freedom-loving creature. Fierce, bold, proud and intelligent. Impossible to capture alive, except if lured into an ambush by a virgin - another reference perhaps to the Virgin Mary connection.

</div>obviously, the truth is, Unicorns really did exist, but we shagged them out of existence, leaving us with sheep! :sorc:<br />

			<center><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Arial"><b>Statement by Vice President Neelie Kroes &quot;on the consequences of living in an age of total information&quot;</b></span></font></center><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><i>Made after the meeting of European Cloud Partnership Board, Tallin, Estonia.</i></span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">We live in an age of total information. It is a data revolution.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Whatever you call it, it has many consequences. And it encompasses an enormous range of policy issues, inside the Digital Agenda portfolio, and outside it. Policies from open data to data protection; from cybersecurity to spying.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">This revolution goes to the heart of the work of the European Cloud Partnership.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Cloud computing helps us benefit from the data revolution and is a gift to our economy. But it depends on two things, more than anything else:</span></font><br />
<ul><li style="">Efficiency through scale. and</li><li style="">Trust that the data is stored securely.</li></ul><br />
<font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">First, if cloud services are denied scale, they become more expensive.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">For example, if individual countries work disjointedly on separate national clouds, then the potential is lost. In this game, ambition cant stop at borders. And this means the European Union has a critical role to play: creating scale, and forging co-operative links. This is about giving customers more reasons to use cloud services and helping cloud services reach maximum scale. This is why we were agreeing on EU-wide specifications today for cloud procurement.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Second, we need trust. In some cases, of course, it may be legitimate for authorities to access, to some degree, information held online; child protection and terrorism are good examples. Such access must be based on transparent rule of law, and is the exception to the rule.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">I want to talk about normal day-to-day business.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">If businesses or governments think they might be spied on, they will have less reason to trust the cloud, and it will be cloud providers who ultimately miss out.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">Why would you pay someone else to hold your commercial or other secrets, if you suspect or know they are being shared against your wishes? Front or back door  it doesnt matter  any smart person doesnt want the information shared at all. Customers will act rationally, and providers will miss out on a great opportunity.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">In this case it is often American providers that will miss out, because they are often the leaders in cloud services. Which brings me to another interesting consequence of recent allegations. Particularly allegations about US government surveillance concerning European partners and allies.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">If European cloud customers cannot trust the United States government or their assurances, then maybe they won't trust US cloud providers either. That is my guess. And if I am right then there are multi-billion euro consequences for American companies.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">If I were an American cloud provider, I would be quite frustrated with my government right now. I do not have an agenda here: I am committed to open markets, to liberal values, and the opportunities of new digital innovations. Yet even I am thinking twice about whether there is such a thing as a level playing field when it comes to the cloud.</span></font><font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">So I am saying two things:</span></font><br />
<ul><li style="">Concerns about cloud security can easily push European policy makers into putting security guarantees ahead of open markets; with consequences for American companies.</li><li style="">Privacy is not only a fundamental right, it can also be a competitive advantage. Companies focused on privacy need to start coming forward into the light and help them do that. That would be a smart company indeed. And 2013 is the year. That includes European companies who should take advantage of interest to provide services with better privacy protection.</li></ul><br />
<font color="#000000"><span style="font-family: Verdana">The cloud has a lot of potential. But potential doesnt count for much in an atmosphere of distrust. European cloud users and, American cloud providers and policy makers need to think carefully about that.<br />

<font color="#333333"><span style="font-family: Arial">&quot;It's literally like cooking any other burger I've experienced before, a nice and pleasant aroma but very subtle at this stage,&quot; added McGeown.</span></font><br />
