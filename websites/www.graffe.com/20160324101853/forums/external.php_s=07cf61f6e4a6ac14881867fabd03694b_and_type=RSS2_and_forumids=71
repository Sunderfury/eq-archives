			Delve deeper into the world of Overwatch, Blizzard’s upcoming team-based shooter, with its new animated short: Recall. Then play FREE during the Open Beta May 5-9: xbox.com/overwatch<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Recall&quot;&quot; tells the story of Winston—a genetically engineered gorilla and brilliant scientist who longs for the days of heroism to return. In this episode, we explore Winston's thoughts and memories as he wrestles with the decision to recall the agents of Overwatch, all while the forces of Talon stage an attack on his laboratory in the abandoned Watchpoint: Gibraltar.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>March is surprisingly subdued this year. It feels like this is the Spring month that typically has the biggest releases, as companies try to take advantage of the way their fiscal years are calculated. As far as consumer hype goes, I suppose this is offset a bit by the fact that this is the month in which the retail version of the Oculus Rift finally launches. I've been meaning to make a thread comparing all the various options, but for starters the Rift launches first, will be $600, and has high requirements, including requiring a plethora of available USB ports.<br />
<br />
As far as actual games go, I think that despite relative apathy compared to its announcement, <b>The Division</b> is the biggest game this month. What I played of the beta seemed perfectly fine, and releasing in a period with little competition might make it alluring, but the longevity of its content has yet to be proven. The only other &quot;AAA&quot; multiplatform title due this month is the first episode in the new <b>Hitman</b> game. The fact this is being broken up into small chunks will probably dampen potential enthusiasm, but it's still worth keeping an eye on.<br />
<br />
Wii U life support continues on with an HD port of <b>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</b>, as well as a Pokemon fighting game. Twilight Princess was a perfectly fine Zelda game that happened to also mark what was probably the beginning of Zelda fatigue. I'm not sure if it is as worthy of the HD treatment as Wind Waker was, but Nintendo needed a stop gap while they continue to work on the newest game. Even Nintendo shares my concern, as they offset this by making it tie into the new game, and giving you rewards if you buy both (and the amiibo).<br />
<br />
The PS4 gets a couple more jrpg ports, as well as a port of <b>Heavy Rain</b> for anyone who missed it the first time. Press X to Jason. The Xone and the PC both get the new season of Killer Instinct, which I assume is more characters.<br />
<br />
Handhelds have a somewhat bleak month. The 3DS is getting its version of <b>Hyrule Warriors</b>, the Zelda beat 'em up, and the Vita is getting another Wizardry style dungeon crawling jrpg from the same people who made the last few. Edit: Apparently this game, <b>Stranger of Sword City</b>, was actually a 360 game that is getting ported to both the Vita and the Xone. Crazy. I've heard nothing about this, and only recognize its lineage because of the art style.<br />

			The Conduit developer High Voltage is making a collectible card game for Oculus Rift called Dragon Front.<br />
<br />
The upcoming CCG will feature competitive leaderboards and multiple factions with their own unique card attributes. The full game will contain 280 characters, 80 encampments, and over 100 spells across 250 cards. <br />
<br />
&quot;In Dragon Front, players are pitted against each other based on skill level and watch their units come to life on the battlefield as they command the action,&quot; Oculus said of this upcoming title. &quot;There's also a champion system where each team can summon legendary boss units to the fight and turn the battle in their favour.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dragon Front is gunning for a release this spring. Here's its debut trailer demonstrating how its card-combat operates in VR:<br />

<br />
Received an email from Kickstarter with projects they are promoting and came across this one.  I've only read what was on the Kickstarter page, watched the 2 videos and listened to the 2 music files, but based on that this game looks very cool.  Before I pledge to get a copy, however, does anyone know anymore about it other than what's on the Kickstarter page?</div>
