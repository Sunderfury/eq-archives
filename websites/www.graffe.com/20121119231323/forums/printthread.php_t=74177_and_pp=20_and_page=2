</div>Both games are excellent. I find myself wishing that they shared more in common with each other. For example: I wish that GW2 had climbable surfaces, ladders, and hardcore investigation missions. Conversely -- I wish that TSW had jumping puzzles, heart-type quest events and a crafting system that makes sense.<br />
<br />
Plus, you know, I die LESS often in TSW, which makes it a tiny bit more relaxing. *chuckle*</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Its not just the level down system, its that paired with the dynamic events that makes lower level content worthwhile.  In other games, you do a zone, and you run out of quests and move on at around the right level you are supposed to.  If you come back all you have are 2-3 quests you missed the first time and a bunch of mobs and nothing else.  The content is essentially dead now, except for a little nostalgia or if I want to level up an alt.  If I go back to the newbie zones in this game, even if I did it, I can still do long and cool event chains all the time like the frozen maw, or the shadow behemoth and have a little challenge to boot.</blockquote>

</div>Blizzard is a piece of a large multinational conglomerate whose sole purpose is to make money.  When WoW and the &quot;WoW customer service dynamic&quot; are no longer profitable, then they will try to change.  Unfortunately for them, innovation is only possible when you encourage it all along.  They will of course fade even more than they have.  <br />
<br />
WoW's last two expansions have been less innovative and not as well received.  D3 sold well but no one thinks it will have the staying power of its predecessors.  <br />

Doing the same thing over and over eventually bores your audience.</blockquote>

</div>I disagree. There is a rather large number of people who will only accept doing the same thing over and over. I call them mmo players.<br />
<br />
I kid, I kid. But seriously, the best selling games all sell to the same people, who sometimes don't play anything else. Blizzard may be victims of their own success, but they aren't failing because people crave innovation.<br />

Hell, the reason why half the people who hated Diablo 3 hated it was because it was <b>too different</b>. They wanted Diablo 2 with better graphics.</blockquote>

<br />
In D2 people grinded multiple characters the same class for different specs, and boss rushed to get items to trade. <br />
<br />
In D3 you're just farming trash for gold against mobs that are still hard and losing large chunks of the hard earned cash in repairs. <br />
