There are a ton of similarities between being a Guild Leader in a MMORPG and being a project maintainer, completely thankless job nearly always. The amount of shit that is necessary to put up with is absurd. I think the most exceptional example is either the PHP mailing list. It's like a really aggressive, hostile instance of bikeshedding except the people rarely can actually build the bikeshed they are being belligerent over. It's worth keeping a product closed simply to avoid dealing with the clusterfuck.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This game recently came to my attention and I decided to try it out. I didn't particularly like it myself, but I think there are aspects of it that might make it something you guys would want to know about, and thus the thread.<br />
<br />
Mobile gaming is a big thing right now, and with declining profits in traditional spaces, a large number of Japanese developers have been resorting to experimenting with mobile games in order to survive, much to the dismay of traditional gamers yearning for new entries in their favorite IPs. I don't want to get too offtopic here, just to say that Square is no exception.<br />
<br />
Record Breaker is the newest entry in a series of such projects. It's a free to play game, and while supposedly not as egregious as most, it has many of the things you would expect from such a game. You have stamina that must be recharged over time before you can do more battles, you can buy chances for loot, etc.<br />
<br />
The format and story of the game is that you exist in a world that chronicles fictional adventures from other universes, and preserves them as paintings in a special magical museum. These paintings thus inspire peace in that world itself. The paintings begin to disappear, and it's your job to bring them back by &quot;reliving&quot; those moments.<br />
<br />
As you can probably guess, those fictional universes are all from numbered Final Fantasy games. The tutorial has you &quot;reliving&quot; the first Mako generator battle in FF7. What this really means, and why I keep putting it in quotations, is that you fight battles themed to that game and that plot. You don't replay the actual sequences themselves. When you are done you get a screenshot of the original game and some sort of text blurb referencing it.<br />
<br />
So it's classic 8-16 bit Final Fantasy ATB combat. Meters fill, then you can select commands. It's actually simplified a great deal (attack, defend, two magic spells, special) and in my opinion is a little brainless, but it serves a purpose which I will get to in a bit. Each painting tends to consist of a few rounds of battle, and sometimes a boss, all relevant to the game in question. <br />
<br />
For completing a painting, you are awarded points based on how well you did, and earn a variety of rewards, from weapons and armor, to new party members. Aside from the main character, party members are all from their respective Final Fantasy games, and you can set up your party composition however you want (although the game did inform me that using characters in their own specific worlds gives stat bonuses).<br />
<br />
<br />
So the reason why I am making a thread about this at all is for the nostalgia. The sprites and the music in particular are great for this reason. While if you want something meatier there are arguably better options, this provides an adaptation of ATB combat that doesn't have to be particularly time consuming.<br />
<br />
I am sure there are some of you that like old rpgs, but don't have the time to get into newer ones. This is essentially a classic Final Fantasy game that you can play in ten minute chunks. <br />
<br />
It's available both for ios and Android. I won't be playing any more of it myself, but if any of you do feel free to share your likes or dislikes.</div>

			In 2013, then-15-year-old Anthony Stokes was dying and desperately needed a heart transplant that he couldn’t get because, according to doctors, he had “a history of noncompliance.”<br />
<br />
Stokes’s family suspected that his low grades and a history of trouble with the law gave doctors reason to believe that he would not be willing to take his medicine or show up at subsequent doctor’s visits. The Georgia teen’s story sparked outrage, and the hospital quickly reversed its decision, giving him priority on the transplant list.<br />
<br />
But two years later, after he received a transplant, Stokes’s “second chance” has come to an abrupt end.<br />
<br />
Tuesday afternoon, Stokes died after a stolen vehicle he was driving jumped a curb, hit a pedestrian and collided with a pole in a car chase with police, according to WSBTV.<br />
<br />
The pedestrian was hospitalized for her injuries, and Stokes’s car was nearly split in half by the sign, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.<br />
<br />
Police said he had to be cut out of the Honda by first responders and rushed to a hospital, where he died around 9:00 p.m.  on Tuesday night.<br />
<br />
“He lost control and there was a long set of skid marks,” Roswell Police Department spokeswoman Lisa Holland told WXIA.<br />
<br />
According to Holland, Stokes was driving a car that matched the description of one used by a person suspected of breaking into an elderly woman’s home. The chase began after officers responding to her 911 call attempted to pull Stokes over, according to WXIA. <br />
<br />
“We haven’t really connected that he was the person who did the burglary,” she said, according to the Journal-Constitution. “He may have been running from something else.”<br />
<br />
But Holland told the Washington Post on Wednesday afternoon that Stokes is a suspect in the burglary, which involved an 81-year old woman. The suspect allegedly broke into the woman’s home and fired a a gun at her but nothing was stolen from the home.<br />
<br />
“She was an 81 years old inside the house and he surprised her and I think she surprised him too because he shot at her,” Holland said.<br />
<br />
When Stokes was first diagnosed, he was initially given less than a year to live without a transplant, according to the Journal-Constitution:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">

	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Anthony suffers from dilated cardiomyopathy, in which the heart’s main pumping chamber, the left ventricle, fails to pump enough blood. The condition is generally treated with medications or devices such as pacemakers before a transplant is considered.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>But a heart transplant procedure requires strict adherence to a medicinal regimen and careful monitoring to prevent the body from rejecting the new heart. Doctors also evaluate whether patients have the support they would need to aid in the recovery process after surgery, experts told CNN.<br />
<br />
It is unclear what exactly caused doctors to change their assessment of Stokes two years ago, but he told WSBTV that he viewed the opportunity as a chance to start over.<br />
<br />
The transplant allowed him to “live a second chance. Get a second chance and do things I want to do,” he said.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>If March was a flood of new game releases, April is pretty barren in comparison. Even the deluge of PS3 Japanese games has slowed to a trickle. There are certainly a few things to look forward to, but most of us will likely find this time better spent playing the things we bought last month.<br />
<br />
There is really only one big new release coming this month, and that's <b>Mortal Kombat X</b>. You should already know if this is the sort of thing that appeals to you or not. The gratuitous violence is being fully embraced, with some of the most disgusting fatalities yet. Whether you like going :wtf: or want to be a cool kid that pretends it doesn't bother you, your bases are covered.<br />
<br />
The Double Fine kickstarted adventure game <b>Broken Age</b> is also set to be finally finished this month, with Sony platforms getting ports of the complete package. I assume those of us with part 1 get part 2 for free, but haven't been following development that closely to say for sure.<br />
<br />
The 3DS is getting a decent month, with a port of <b>Xenoblade</b> being the main attraction. It's very important to know that you need the new 3DS sku (literally named &quot;New 3DS&quot; in stores) to be able to play it, as it has a faster cpu.<br />
<br />
Sony platforms in general are getting a lot of ports of games from other platforms as part of their Spring sale I mentioned last month. The only fully original game for the PS4 this month is <b>Omega Quintet</b>, a jrpg from Compile Heart, also known as the B(or C?) team of jrpgs. Be aware that the game is idol themed, so unless you are into that stuff, you might want to just pick up Type 0 from last month instead. FYI: idols = teen pop stars that sing and dance. <br />
<br />
Both new platforms (PS4 and Xone) are getting ports of <b>Dark Souls 2</b>. I do not know if they fixed the lighting engine. It might be interesting to see how this is, but I get the feeling it's mostly going to appeal to xbox users who can't play Bloodborne.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, as far as I am aware <b>Mighty No 9</b> is supposed to come out this month, but being a digital game, I'll believe it when I see it. This is the spiritual successor to Megaman that was kickstarted awhile back. It should be pretty good.<br />
<br />

			(Reuters) - A 4-year-old Pennsylvania girl surprised a driver and passengers when she boarded a public bus alone in the middle of the night on a quest for a sugary slushy, transportation officials said on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Surveillance footage shows the pint-sized girl with blonde hair, bundled up in all purple, boarding a Philadelphia bus at 3 a.m. local time on Friday and sit down by herself as a handful of passengers look curiously toward her.<br />
<br />
The girl, who appeared cheerful as she stretched and dangled her boots off of her seat, told bus riders that she wanted to get a slushie, Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority spokeswoman Kristin Geiger said.<br />
<br />
Upon noticing the child, the bus driver pulled over, called his control center and waited for police to arrive, Geiger said. The girl was taken unharmed to a nearby hospital, where she was reunited with her parents.<br />
<br />
Driver Harlan Jenifer, who Geiger described as an exemplary employee, told reporters that he was &quot;shocked&quot; to see the girl riding solo. <br />
<br />
The parents of the girl said they did not know that their daughter had slipped out the back door in search of her favorite beverage at a nearby convenience store, the local ABC News-affiliate reported.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will take you to buy a slushie,&quot; mother Jaclyn Mager told her daughter, who asked again for the drink, in an interview with the local television station. &quot;But... promise me next time you'll wait for me, okay?&quot;

<br />
This describes me mostly. I am up for communicating, talking about anything, but not interested in having my time wasted with dickery and likely to come off as stuck up unless I am making an effort to mingle; that's not a diss to you I am just likely spaced out thinking about problems and/or off my face and the walls are melting. The only other thing I would like is if it had banned topic and a level of intimacy with strangers I am okay with: mensa meetings have something similar to this.<br />
<br />
Ideally something like what it already is then:<br />
<br />
- Not interested in banal small talk (such as the weather which I can look up in &lt; .1 seconds with more authoritative information)<br />
- Politics, ever<br />
- Qualitative circle jerks outside of philosophy<br />
<br />
- Most interested in talking about<b></b>:<br />
Math, Philosophy, Mythology, Literature, System Design, Coffee, Nootropics, Security, Program Analysis, Farming, Control Systems, Cults, and why Gwern.net rocks the casbah<br />
<br />
- Lets keep it to hand shakes maximum, no exceptions*; bubble decreases the more we know one another, don't cough or sneeze on me and wash your hands cause Jesus and germs are everywhere. <br />
- I am not interested in a romantic relationship with you, no exceptions. <br />
<br />
* Unless we are fucking, don't touch me past the palm and your palm or chest bumps if we are bros/sisters!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm not sure how many people are left who care about anime on this forum, and anyone who does should already know about this one, but I (late to the party) just got around to watching this and thought it was amazing enough to deserve a thread.<br />
<br />
One sentence sell on this anime: it's from the people who made Gurren Lagann. It came out and blew up over the internet about a year ago, i think, but I ignored it for a few reasons, including not liking the weird fan servicey character designs. Well shame on me for doubting these guys, because the show is fantastic. <br />
<br />
I'll also go ahead and say that there are many styles of anime that can appeal to different people's tastes, but this is not the kind I would recommend to people who don't already like anime. Like Gurren Lagann, you will appreciate it more the more you have been exposed to other anime, specifically of the genre it represents. <br />
<br />
Where Gurren Lagann was both a parody and a celebration of giant robot anime, Kill la Kill is a parody and a celebration of transformation warrior anime, for lack of a better genre label. It's all about shows where the characters power up and transform into ridiculous outfits to battle each other. As I said, I reacted negatively to these designs, but after having given it a chance realize that it's part of the genius of their take on the genre.<br />
<br />
I don't want to give too much credit to the explanations, as bullshitting contrived justifications for fanservice by itself isn't remarkable in the least, I think it's the how itself that makes the show special. Most of the time it seems less like an attempt to be alluring and more like a joke instead. It is also gender neutral, as one of the central male characters has a habit of getting more and more naked the longer he monologues, culminating in a couple purple lens flare effects that can change position for the sake of comedy. Of course, it could be said that I only find it mild because of how ridiculous and blatant it is in other anime these days, but most of it still seems fairly benign to me. <br />
<br />
That's not the only convention of the genre that the show parodies. Another example is how every transformation or special attack is accompanied by large red kanji characters that sometimes become physical objects in the world itself, complete with their own shadows. It's great.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what is the show itself about? Ryuko returns home to find her father brutally murdered and goes on a quest to find the killer. She finds herself at an academy run by a dictator named Satsuki who looks down on human beings in general. The academy itself produces school uniforms made of a special material that enhances the wearer's abilities, and Ryuko finds she is no match for them, only to discover a similar power her father left behind for her. She also befriends the school slacker, who contributes to a fair amout of the comedic relief of the show, and 90% of all internet gifs of the show. She's a goofball and it's great.<br />
<br />
The show deals in themes related to clothing and the &quot;sin&quot; of nakedness. It's also got some of the stylish music and fight scenes you would expect.<br />
<br />
So in short, if you liked Gurren Lagann then you should watch this. If you haven't seen Gurren Lagann, you should watch that, then watch this. <br />
<br />
I watched it in Japanese, but here is the English trailer, along with one of my favorite character themes. One of the things I like about anime is the way specific music can be overlaid with exposition to make a scene seem more dramatic, and this was the best one for that. Be careful of spoilers if you open these in youtube itself though.<br />

<br />
<br />
On a side note, I don't watch tv anymore, but checked out Adult Swim at a relative's house and was amazed at how much anime they had on. It was technically Toonami, but I remember getting new anime on the network used to be so rare that they would make fun of it in their commercial breaks.<br />
<br />
They had Kill la Kill, Deadman Wonderland (good for few episodes, but doesn't really go anywhere), Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online, a new Inuyasha, Naruto, etc. I think I would personally still just recommend streaming that stuff, as I don't see any point in watching something in three months that you can watch in one week, but I was still impressed.</div>
