		<blockquote class="restore">Firstly you can't take the test in linux as you must run &quot;Repondus Lockdown Browser&quot; to take the test.  This prevents you from opening another tab and googling the answer.   This is a great anti cheating tool so long as students don't have textbooks, phones, or friends.  Actually searching the internet wouldn't help anyway because the answers to the questions are randomly pulled out of someones asshole.  You might actually have a better chance of cheating with a ouija board or a set of dice.  Try this one on for size motherfuckers<br />
<br />
1) The answer to the next question will be decided by<br />
<br />
A) The result of a dice roll<br />
B) generator.nextInt( n );<br />
C) The cup size of the last chick I slept with<br />
D) The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mechanical turk</a><br />
<br />
Out of the last exam 7 out of 50 questions were dead wrong.  Ex.  An example of safe computing: Right answer C: telnet NO NO NO NO<br />
<br />
The goddamn book describes telnet as &quot;an internal threat&quot; to secure computing bitches!</blockquote>

My school uses blackboard for their online shit and to prevent cheating on quizzes makes the student go to campus for exams by proctor, which just means you use the school's computer with no books.</blockquote>

</div>You mean education that actually makes an effort to educate rather than just suck up student loan money and feeding it into the paychecks of the senor administration of the university while throwing the teaching staff peanuts?<br />

		<blockquote class="restore">Cheating is pretty rampant in college; I don't think it is really a big deal though that that is the case though as what is primarily cheated on is not worth a ton of points and you still have to study a lot to pass exams and do well on projects.  I think cheating ( at least in engineering) is primarily motivated by time efficiency rather than an inability to do the work or incompetence.  The volume of work required is obscene between reports and tests and projects and homework and quizzes, then on top of that organization and club requirements, developing and maintaining social networks for future career purposes.  It's very strenuous and stressful.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">As an aside, I much prefer classes that are designed around projects and fewer exams and that have ungraded HW.  Regular quizzes that are mainly geared towards tracking attendance are great too.  A lot of classes first testing of student's knowledge is graded though and as a result encourages cheating to maintain high scores and get easy points that ultimately inflate class averages.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Usually the classes I took (aside from Senior design projects) did not have projects required of the class unless you took honors classes, which nearly always did.  They were great for increasing my grasp of the course as we applied the techniques learned to a realized design.  The honors physics classes used more advanced mathematics too.  For example, physics I/II used vector calculus instead of just already derived equations in 2 dimensions.</blockquote>
