			Nintendo says Super Mario in-browser game 'illegal'<br />
<br />
A browser-based re-creation of the popular Super Mario Brothers console game has fallen foul of Nintendo's copyright lawyers, The Washington Post has reported.<br />
<br />
College student Josh Goldberg created the Full Screen Mario site in HTML 5 so people could play the game in a web browser rather than on a games console.<br />
<br />
But Nintendo has asked him to remove the content saying it infringes its &quot;intellectual property rights&quot;.<br />
<br />
The game is still operational.<br />
<br />
Mr Goldberg, who admitted he did not get permission from Nintendo to re-create the game, said he began the project in October 2012 as a computer programming exercise.<br />
<br />
He &quot;didn't care&quot; about copyright issues because he &quot;didn't think it would be a big project&quot;, he told the newspaper.<br />
<br />
But after little initial interest the game is now receiving 300,000 unique visitors a day, Mr Goldberg claims, after Boing Boing's Cory Doctorow blogged about it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Mr Goldberg, the site's popularity also brought it to the attention of Nintendo's lawyers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nintendo's like Disney - it will not tolerate their characters being used on anything,&quot; said Keza MacDonald, UK games editor for IGN.com, the video game and entertainment site.<br />
<br />
&quot;Earlier this year Nintendo stopped people posting footage of their games on YouTube, so this behaviour sounds entirely consistent.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the site's home page the site declares: &quot;Mario, Super Mario Brothers, and all associated games and media are property of Nintendo and/or Nintendo of America Inc., and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws.&quot;<br />
<br />
Super Mario Brothers was copyrighted by Nintendo in 1985, but under US law, corporate copyright lasts for 95 years.

</div>Once again a big IP owner misses the point and shoots first.   I really see nothing wrong with this unless the guy starts to directly make a profit off the code itself.  I think Nintendo should be praising for keeping the game that created Nintendo itself on people's minds.   After all it was SMB that sold the NES.</blockquote>

</div>What ads? I don't see any. And who gives a shit if he's making money off this. <br />
<br />
Copyright law is broken. If the duration of a copyright was 15 years, and then into the public domain goes the work. Instead, every time Mickey Mouse is about to become public property, Congress extends the duration of a copyright. Extending copyright is actual stealing; it is stealing from the public domain. Maybe piracy is a good thing.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">The real issue here is trademarks, which you have to defend or risk losing. As much as I hate Nintendo for going after projects like this, the fact of the matter is that this guy could have easily replicated the mechanics of SMB and then assembled a game with original artwork and levels. Of course, that wouldn't have gotten him the attention (good and bad) that using a property like Mario did...</blockquote>
