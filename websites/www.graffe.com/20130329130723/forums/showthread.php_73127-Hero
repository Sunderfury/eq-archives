							I've been digging through some old files and have come across a few writing assignments and other bits and pieces that I compiled during my time in college.  <br />
<br />
One such piece was the short fiction story that I wrote for a Creative Writing course.  The professor was one of those super-egotistical guys who wrote something good once and never let anyone forget what an awesome writer he was, but as far as I could tell he wasn't writing shit anymore.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I figured that instead of writing something fun and imaginative, I needed to write something heavy and pretentious in order to satisfy this git of a teacher.  After all, all the examples he gave us were pieces like Hemingway's &quot;Kilimanjaro,&quot; and other pieces where the author was basically jacking off into the reader's eyes.  So here's my example of that genre, the pretentious short story of super heavy literary heaviness.  Enjoy!

							&quot;So,&quot;  she said, &quot;when one of the stewin' rabbits got loose, I was <br />
huntin' around the camp for it, and I finally caught it hidin' in the <br />
flour sack.  I locked it up, and went back to makin' breakfast.  For a <br />
treat, I whipped up a batch o' plain muffins.  While I was warshin' up, <br />
one of the loggers stuck his head in and tole me they was the best <br />
raisin muffins he'd ever had.  'Cept, I never put no raisins in 'em.  <br />
That was the rabbit's doin'.&quot;  Eleanor's  chuckle was two dry sticks <br />
rubbing together.  She took a hit off of her cigarette.<br />
     Bill smiled, wishing the old bitch would shut up and get their <br />
food.  He smelled the rich meat of the steaks frying on the greasy <br />
grill, and his mouth watered.  Lisa was still laughing, the silly <br />
little fool, with that raucous hyena's laugh of hers.  Miserable bitch <br />
looked like shit these days.  You had to turn the lights off just to <br />
get it up with the burnt-out skank hag anymore.<br />
     &quot;'Course, that ain't nearly as funny as the time my youngest had a <br />
bee fly up his pants leg...&quot;  Eleanor said.<br />
     Damn bitches fuckin' damn damn shit damn damn....<br />
<br />
<br />
     Pat and Kate reached the turnoff from the main highway just <br />
as the sun touched the peaks of the mountains across the canyon.  Pat <br />
drove down into the dim shadows at the end of a cloudy day.  Though the <br />
car was hot and stuffy, the twilight was cold.  Kate was asleep, her <br />
head nestled against Pat's shoulder.  She stirred in her sleep and said <br />
something incomprehensible.<br />
     As Pat drove deeper into the canyon, the light grew dimmer.  He <br />
switched on the headlights.  Snowflakes swirled before the headlights, <br />
not many but growing in number quickly until they became a gray curtain <br />
around the car.  Pat slowed down and looked for a place to park.  He <br />
came upon a roadside diner, and pulled into the tiny parking lot.  Kate <br />
woke up and yawned, asking sleepily &quot;Are we there yet?&quot;<br />
     The parking lot of the old diner was empty, apart from a pair of <br />
four-wheel-drive trucks.  An electric sign, missing a letter, flashed <br />
the message &quot;G od Eats.&quot;  An orange neon sign in the window advertised <br />
the fact that Budweiser was sold there.  A snowblower engine could be <br />
heard winding up around the back.<br />
     &quot;Not yet,&quot; he answered, &quot;We're stopping for a bite to eat.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Mm.  If God eats here, the food just has to be good.  Let's bring <br />
in my suitcase, I feel like I've been sleeping in these clothes.&quot;<br />
     &quot;I can't imagine why.  I'd better change too.  I have a wet spot <br />
on my shoulder where you were drooling.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Be happy women still drool over you.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Could you help an old man with the suitcases?&quot;<br />
     &quot;I suppose I should be rested up enough by now, considering I lost <br />
consciousness somewhere in Utah.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Well, don't expect me to drive back and help you look for it.&quot;<br />
     The snowblower shut down, and echoes rounded the valley.<br />
     When they opened the car doors the chill air swept through their <br />
clothing and through meat to strike bone.  They grabbed a couple of <br />
suitcases from the back seat and hustled into the diner.<br />
     Dingy yellow plastic made up most of the inside of the diner: <br />
seats patched with duct tape, formica tabletops, roses in empty beer <br />
bottles, and grayed linoleum.  Beer signs on the walls showed blue <br />
mountain streams, the &quot;water&quot; seeming to flow endlessly over electric <br />
waterfalls.  Along one wall, a row of trophies stared down with <br />
sightless eyes at the short bar and stained pool table.  A jukebox <br />
stood next to the bar, softly playing a country music song.  The dim <br />
lighting came from naked 60-watt bulbs in ceiling fixtures.<br />
     The wind blew against the door and windows behind them, but the <br />
diner was cozy and warm.  A smell of broiled beef and deep-fried <br />
potatoes filled the room, and the sound of Hank Williams singing &quot;Your <br />
Cheatin' Heart&quot; could be heard over the sounds of dishes being washed <br />
and cutlery clattering against plates.<br />
     A middle-aged couple sat in one of the booths, eating steak and <br />
french fries.  The man had thinning black hair and a thick neck covered <br />
with gun-metal stubble where no razor could ever get at it.  The woman <br />
had long blonde hair and a nervous expression.  They looked up as Pat <br />
and Kate came in, and the man raised his voice and called out:  <br />
&quot;Eleanor, you got a couple more customers here!&quot;<br />
     An elderly lady came out through the open kitchen door, wiping her <br />
hands on a dishtowel.<br />
     &quot;You folks just set yourselves down anywheres you like,&quot;  she said <br />
in a surprisingly deep baritone, grabbing a menu from the rack beside <br />
the cash register. &quot;I'll take your order right away.  I was just tryin' <br />
to clear a path to my trailer out back, and the dang 'blower ran outta <br />
gas!  What brings you folks out on an evenin' like this?&quot;<br />
     &quot;We were driving by when the snow started.  Lucky for us you're <br />
open.  Kate, you ready to order?&quot;<br />
     &quot;I'll have whatever these folks are having, it smells real good.  <br />
Excuse me just a minute.&quot;  Kate grabbed a suitcase and headed for the <br />
door marked &quot;Ladies.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Make that two of whatever these folks are having,&quot; Pat smiled at <br />
Eleanor, &quot;One medium and one medium rare.&quot;<br />
     &quot;You got it, that'll be about fifteen minutes.&quot;  Eleanor went to <br />
the kitchen and came back with place settings and poured two glasses of <br />
water.  As she went back into the kitchen, the man looked back at Pat <br />
and smiled with his mouth.<br />
     &quot;You live in Nueva City?  Nice town.  Nice and quiet.  Mostly <br />
loggers out this way.  What kinda work you do?&quot;<br />
     &quot;I write spy thrillers.  You know, the Cliff Benson series.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Never heard of it.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Yeah, well, it's pretty big back East.&quot;<br />
     &quot;A writer, eh?  Well, it takes all kinds.  By the way, my name is <br />
Bill, and this here is Lisa.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Pleased to meet you.  My name is Pat Kelly, and the woman in the <br />
bathroom is my wife, Kate.  She'd be pleased to meet you too, I'm <br />
sure.&quot;<br />
     &quot;I'd sure be pleased to meet her, that's for sure.&quot;  Bill made two <br />
quick turns of his wrist for emphasis.<br />
     &quot;Uh... Do you folks live up here, or are you visiting?&quot;  Pat asked <br />
quietly.<br />
     &quot;We come up every year for the fishing.  Lisa just loves to fish, <br />
don't you honey?&quot;<br />
     &quot;'Scuse me.&quot;  Lisa edged out of the booth and headed for the <br />
ladies room with a tight expression around her mouth.<br />
     &quot;Women.  Spend all the damn time in the bathroom.&quot;  Bill observed.  <br />
Pat acknowledged with the slightest of nods.<br />
     Bill looked Pat over.  Not quite as young as he looks, he thought.  <br />
Closer to my age.  Kind of homely-looking with all those freckles, <br />
probably looks like Howdy Doody without that eyepatch.  Wonder how he <br />
lost the arm...<br />
     &quot;Pat.  You mind if I ask you a question?&quot;    <br />
     &quot;Ask away.&quot;<br />
     &quot;How'd you lose your arm and eye?&quot;<br />
     &quot;It's pretty simple,&quot; he replied, &quot;I lost them in Vietnam.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Yeah?  I was in 'Nam too.  Hey!  Want to see the fish I caught?  <br />
They're in my truck.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Sure.  Let me get my coat on.&quot;<br />
     The two men put on their coats and went out to the parking lot.  <br />
The snow was still falling.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Kate was brushing her hair in the bathroom when a knock came from <br />
the door.<br />
     &quot;Come in.&quot;  She turned, and the young woman with long blonde hair <br />
came in and shut the door.  She looked like she was ready to cry, and <br />
Kate asked &quot;Are you okay, honey?&quot;<br />
     The tears started to come then, against the woman's will, <br />
squeezing past her self-control as little hot bullets of despair.<br />
     &quot;I've tried so hard to get that man to love me, and all I've <br />
accomplished is that I'm beginning to hate him.&quot;<br />
     Kate resigned herself to the dreary role of Bathroom Counselor, <br />
and put her arm around the woman's shoulders.<br />
     &quot;Now, it can't be as bad as all that...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
          Bill pulled back the tarp on the nearest of the two pickups, <br />
and motioned Pat to come and look.  In the bed of the pickup was a <br />
basket full of dry ice and dead fish.<br />
     Bill opened the unlocked door of the truck, and pulled a hunting <br />
rifle from the rack.<br />
     &quot;Thirty-ought-six,&quot; he said proudly. &quot;Blow a hole through an <br />
elephant the size of my fist.&quot;<br />
     Pat said, through teeth clenched with cold, &quot;I think I heard <br />
something in that ditch across the road.  Sounds like a kid crying.&quot;<br />
     &quot;I'll take a look.&quot;  Bill walked across the road, still carrying <br />
the rifle, and peered into the ditch.       &quot;Nope, nothing in here but <br />
snow.&quot;<br />
     At that moment a deer came running down the road, a three-point <br />
buck galloping stiff-legged on tiptoes.  Bill raised the rifle to his <br />
shoulder, sighted, fired, missed.  The buck scrambled down the slopes <br />
into the dark before the echoes had died.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Eleanor finished filling the tank of the snowblower, then put the <br />
cap back loosely on the gas can.  She dragged the heavy snowblower out <br />
the back door, knocking over the gas can in the process.  The clear, <br />
slightly pink fluid gushed over the kitchen floor.  As she came back in <br />
from the cold, Eleanor slipped on the wet floor, dropping her <br />
cigarette.<br />
<br />
<br />
     &quot;He's just gotten worse every year since he got home from <br />
Vietnam,&quot;  said Lisa.  &quot;He doesn't have any friends except his army <br />
buddies, and he's gotten so rude and mean that nobody wants anything to <br />
do with us.  Was your husband in the war?  If he was, I bet that's what <br />
they're talking about right now.&quot;<br />
     &quot;No, Pat wasn't in the war.  He wasn't eligible for the service <br />
because he lost an arm and an eye in a traffic accident when he was <br />
nine.  He wanted to go real bad, too, to be with his brother in the <br />
Marines.  His brother never came back, though.  Hey, do you smell <br />
something?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
     &quot;Missed the sonofabitch!&quot; howled Bill.<br />
     &quot;Do you leave your gun loaded in an unlocked truck all the time?&quot; <br />
asked Pat.<br />
     &quot;My weapon is always loaded.  Say, what branch of the service were <br />
you in?&quot;<br />
     &quot;Uh, the Marines.&quot;<br />
     &quot;What outfit?&quot;<br />
     &quot;I don't like to talk about the war.&quot;<br />
     &quot;Okay.  Lisa don't like it much when I talk about the war either, <br />
or when I get my army buddies to come over for poker.  I'd trade her in <br />
for a newer model, but we been married twenty-two years last July, and <br />
you know what they mean when they say Semper Fidelis.&quot;<br />
     &quot;No, what?&quot;<br />
     &quot;I knew it!  You weren't in no Marines at all!  No marine would <br />
call a rifle a gun, and Semper Fidelis is the Corps' motto.  You lyin' <br />
sack of shit!&quot;<br />
     &quot;Where do you think I lost my arm?  You think I lost my eye <br />
because I left the spoon in my coffee?&quot;<br />
     Pat turned towards the diner, away from Bill.  Then the diner <br />
exploded.  The explosion knocked both Pat and Bill down, but both of <br />
them got up again immediately.<br />
     &quot;Lisa!  Oh my god, Lisa!&quot;  Bill yelled, looking wildly around him <br />
as if help could come out of the shadows.  <br />
     Pat ran past Bill, into the burning diner, but the door to the <br />
ladies room was barred by a collapsed beam, and screams came from <br />
within.  He looked around, and saw a fire extinguisher, an axe, and an <br />
alarm switch behind a sheet of glass.  He smashed the glass, pulled the <br />
switch, and grabbed the axe with his hand.  He swung at the beam until <br />
it broke in two, and he dug the axe into the severed beam and dragged <br />
it away from the door.  The door opened, and Kate and Lisa came out.  <br />
They ran to the front door and were out, while Pat searched for <br />
Eleanor.  The heat from the fire, mostly in the back of the diner, <br />
increased, so Pat ran out the front door just as the roof fell in.<br />
<br />
<br />
     Bill stood in the snow and watched the diner burn.  He thought of <br />
Vietnam, again, remembering his first week there, the week of his <br />
eighteenth birthday.  After the drop, his first, they had pulled back <br />
some.  Bill hadn't fired the machine gun even once.  He looked back <br />
over his shoulder to make some wisecrack about milk runs, when the <br />
rocket hit.<br />
     The chopper spun in, while Bill hung on and screamed at the top of <br />
his lungs.  He didn't remember the crash itself;  he remembered waking <br />
up afterwards, a bag full of sharp broken sticks and unbearable agony.  <br />
The goddamn chopper was on fire!  He crawled out through a crack in the <br />
fuselage, and was trying to get as much distance as possible between <br />
him and the chopper when the pilot woke up.  He could hear the screams, <br />
so much like a baby in pain.<br />
     Twenty hours later, he was found and rescued.  Eight weeks <br />
afterwards he was on the Cambodian border, fighting a dirty war against <br />
a bunch of skinny kids.<br />
     &quot;Bill...&quot;  He turned and Lisa was standing there, shivering.  <br />
&quot;What's the matter?&quot;<br />
     &quot;Nothing matters any more except us.&quot;  He wrapped his arms around <br />
her and held her against the cold.  Snow fell across their embrace and <br />
melted away.  They were still holding each other when the fire trucks <br />
came up the road.<br />
<br />
<br />
     In the fire station, Pat and Kate sat close and shared warmth, <br />
waiting for their statements to be typed, so they could sign them and <br />
be on their way.  Bill and Lisa had escaped this chore by slipping into <br />
their truck and driving away while the firemen were busy hosing down <br />
the embers.  The fire department suspected that Eleanor had left a can <br />
of gasoline near the water heater.  All that was left of Eleanor and <br />
the Good Eats Diner was a blackened mess by the side of the road and <br />
some paperwork downtown.  No more stories and hot black coffee.
