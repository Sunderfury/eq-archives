Long story short, Capcom has had trouble lately, and found itself with no game in development to coincide with the 25th anniversary of Megaman. At EVO 2012, a fan showed someone at Capcom a project he was working on, and the Capcom guy was so impressed he convinced the company to help fund and finish the game. This amuses me because it is the exact opposite of what normally occurs with fan projects.<br />
<br />
The game is Street Fighter X Megman, a crossover game in the old 8bit Megaman style with Street Fighter characters as the &quot;robot villains&quot; at the end of stages. It will be a free PC download on December 17th. <br />
<br />
Here's the trailer, the Street Fighter characters in Megaman art style are adorable.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I completely forgot about this, and by amusing coincidence turned my television on right when this was coming on. (I don't watch much television) Regardless of how you feel about the awards themselves, these are always a good way to see new trailers of upcoming games.<br />
<br />
Not really a big night in that regard this year, the two best things on display were a story and gameplay trailer of The Last of Us, which was amazing, and the announcement (via cinematic trailer) of Dark Souls 2.<br />
<br />
Already announced games they showed more of: South Park, Castlevania Lord of Shadow 2, Tomb Raider, Bioshock Infinite, Gears of War (a prequel from the looks of it), and new Assassin's Creed 3 stuff which looked to be a huge spoiler so I didn't watch all of it.<br />
<br />
As for the show itself, they streamlined it a bit again, got rid of some of the stuff that didn't work last year and added a few other things that didn't work. :p One thing I liked were these skits where they made Samuel Jackson (the host) a character in various videogames. The humor was about as forced as you would expect, but I liked the Walking Dead and Minecraft ones.<br />
<br />
Many of the winners surprised me, as they were largely from the list of games that usually go overlooked in favor of the big budget monsters. Most surprising was game of the year, which went to The Walking Dead. Now, I liked that game, but I didn't get the impression it was a big deal in the gaming industry. I sort of wonder if viewers got to vote, and a lot of the viewers were fans of the TV show but had never even played the game. I don't want to take away their accomplishment, it just did not fit the norm for winners of this award.<br />
<br />
Edit: I'm having internet troubles, and it doesn't look like GameTrailers has videos for each specific trailer yet (odd that), so not going to post links at this time. If nothing else, look up the footage for The Last of Us. I may post it sometime later if no one else has by then.</div>

			<i>Over the last month, both game publishers and gaming communities alike were surprised to find their GameSpy multiplayer support suddenly disabled by </i><a href="http://www.glu.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>GLU Mobile</i></a><i>, who </i><a href="http://gamepolitics.com/2012/08/02/ign-unloads-gamespy-glu-mobile-27-million" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>purchased</i></a><i> GameSpy from IGN this August.  Many games, including Neverwinter Nights 1 &amp; 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator X, Swat 4, Sniper Elite, Hidden and Dangerous 2, Wings of War, Star Wars: Battlefront are no longer able to find (and in some cases even host) multiplayer games.  <br />
<br />
While games like Neverwinter Nights are still able to directly connect to servers if players know the IP address, less-fortunate gamers expressed outrage on GLU Mobile's 'Powered by GameSpy' </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/gamespytech" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Facebook page</i></a><i>. In an </i><a href="http://sniperelitev2.com/Forum/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=2062" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>open letter</i></a><i> to their Sniper Elite gaming community today, UK game developer </i><a href="http://www.rebellion.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><i>Rebellion</i></a><i> explained it was helpless to change the situation:<br />
<br />
 </i><div style="margin-left:80px"><i>'A few weeks ago, the online multiplayer servers for Sniper Elite were suddenly switched off by Glu, the third-party service we had been paying to maintain them. This decision by Glu was not taken in consultation with us and was beyond our control.  We have been talking to them since to try and get the servers turned back on. We have been informed that in order to do so would cost us tens of thousands of pounds a year  far in excess of how much we were paying previously.  We also do not have the option to take the multiplayer to a different provider. Because the game relies on Glu and Gamespy's middleware, the entire multiplayer aspect of the game would have to be redeveloped by us, again, at the cost of many tens of thousands of pounds.'</i>   </div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It's a little soon to be hyping 2013, so I figured I would make a thread reflecting on 2012 instead. I originally thought it would be a good way to close the 2012 thread, but decided to make a new thread instead.<br />
<br />
2012 was a decent year, but not an amazing one. Two new systems launched, and several good games were released, but to my knowledge there wasn't that one amazing spark that set the world on fire. Of course, with Diablo 3 and Guild Wars 2 sucking up all my free time, it's possible I just missed it, but I don't think I've seen the same level of hype for anything the same way I did for Skyrim, Batman, and Red Dead in years past.<br />
<br />
For those that give in to their pessimistic natures, 2012 might actually be the year of disappointments, but I think the good balanced out the bad.<br />
<br />
So having said all that, here's the discussion part of the thread: What was your favorite game from 2012?<br />
<br />
I think mine was probably Ghost Trick. This is sort of cheating, as it was actually a 2011 game, but I didn't play it until it got ported to the iPhone this year. It's a very simple combination of unique puzzle gameplay and interestingly weird story.<br />
<br />
Out of all the games I didn't find time for, I'm expecting to like Dishonored and Xcom the most, although even then I don't know if they will match the surprised satisfaction I had with Ghost Trick.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A friend of mine was talking to me the other day about some of her favorite classic RPGs.  She'd recently bought an X-Box, and discovered Skyrim isn't remotely close to her liking.  While her favorite part of games like Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger were exploring and talking to people, she finds Skyrim to be far TOO open-ended.  She'd prefer not to even be able to pick up items she doesn't need.  She also doesn't like consequence-based story systems where you take reputation hits or faction hits and whatnot based on semi-arbitrary actions and stupid multiple-choice dialogs.  In that same vein, job systems like FFV aren't too appealing either.  Whatever nerd/left-brain mentality I have that makes me love unlocking skills of every single job she just finds frustrating.  Finally, as a single adult, games that require an enormous time investment are also not that fun, although I'm sure this last one is semi-negotiable.<br />
<br />
She played some of FFVII when it came out, I think, but not enough to really have a strong opinion one way or the other.<br />
<br />
She also said she bought FFXIII-2 but hasn't tried playing it yet.  We don't know if she'll like it or not.<br />
<br />
Either way, what are the spiritual successors to the classic SNES Final Fantasy games?  Story-based, plot-driven, character-driven games more than blank slate WRPG sandbox games.<br />
<br />
(X-Box, Wii, Mac are the available systems, I think.)</div>

Completely re-designed black and red case, what appears to be a top-loading disc drive, no Wifi* and no support for GameCube games or controllers (though the more recent regular Wii bundles had ditched that already).<br />
<br />
<i>* A lot of sites are reporting &quot;no internet support&quot;, but it's not explicitly stated if the Wii Mini also dropped support for USB Ethernet adapters.</i><br />
<br />
With a release date of December 7th, I can't help but wonder how many disappointed children will be finding this under the tree instead of the Wii U they probably wanted.</div>

The two most notable titles for this month are Far Cry 3 and Hawken, the latter being a free to play Mech fps that got a lot of attention at E3.<br />
<br />
December is a good month to take a breather and finish up older games, or catch up on what you missed.<br />
<br />
I just picked up Xcom and Dishonored myself. A friend also got tired of listening to me explain how I didn't have time for Skyrim and sent me a copy himself.<br />
<br />
What about you guys? What will you be playing?<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh right, and this technically isn't a December release but I didn't know about it until now, so this is where I'm posting it.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if any of you played 9 Doors 9 Persons 9 Hours after all my hyping it up, but a sequel for it came out on the 3DS and Vita. The last one was a bit of a hybrid between an adventure/puzzle game and a graphic novel, with choices taking you down different branches in the plot as you try to unravel a mystery.</div>

			Last night after the midnight release of the new Nintendo Wii U gaming console, we did what any self respecting hardware fan would do: we tore it apart.  That's right, while live on our PC Perspective Live! page, we opened up a pair of Wii U consoles, played a couple of games on the Deluxe while we took a tri-wing screwdriver to the second.  Inside we found some interesting hardware (and a lot more screws) and at the conclusion of the 5+ hour marathon, we had a reassembled system with only a handful of leftover screws!<br />
 <br />
If you missed the show last night we have archived the entire video on our YouTube channel (embedded below) as well as the photos we took during the event in their full resolution glory.  There isn't much to discuss about the teardown other than what we said in the video but I am going to leave a few comments after each set of four images.<br />
 <br />
OH!  And if you missed the live event and want to be apart of another one, we are going to be holding a Hitman: Absolution Game Stream on our Live Page sponsored by AMD with giveaways like Radeon graphics cards and LOTS of game keys!  Stop by again and see us on <a href="http://pcper.com/live" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://pcper.com/live</a> on Tuesday the 20th at 8pm ET.<br />
