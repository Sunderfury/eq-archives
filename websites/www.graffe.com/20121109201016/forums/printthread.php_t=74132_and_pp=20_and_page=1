		<blockquote class="restore"><b>Website:</b><a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftlgame.com/</a><br />
Available for purchase from: Website (includes a Steam key) for Win/Mac/Linux, Steam for Win/Mac, or GoG for Windows only, I think.<br />
Price: $10, 10% off for the launch weekend (for the math-challenged, that's $9).<br />
<br />
This is a snazzy game with an interesting history. The developers (2 guys) decided to use the brand-new (at the time) Kickstarter website to fund the last quarter of their game. They asked for a modest amount - I think like $10k? - but received a massive amount more - like $250k? They did not expand the game, except to add high-quality music. The graphics became more refined, and they had the budget to polish a lot more of the features than their original expectation. The beta was resounding, and Tycho from Penny-Arcade gave <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/2012/09/14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a great review here</a>. (Also, see the <a href="http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/two-men-200000-and-a-successful-kickstarter-how-ftl-did-everything-right" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PAR</a>.)<br />
<br />
I bought the game yesterday (Friday, launch day), and I've enjoyed it immensely. It really is the mix of Star Trek and Star Control I/II that I was hoping for. Easy to access, lots of replayability, but still challenging and intuitive.<br />
<br />
The price is right, DRM is absent, and these guys are serious about continuing to make games in this vein. Check it out, support this type of awesome game development!</blockquote>

</div>That's a fair point, but that's not what you spend your time doing, anyway. This is a strategy/resource management game, wrapped in a sci-fi/spaceship theme. Think of this as playing Baldur's Gate or Fallout, with each jump putting you in a pause-able scenario (combat or otherwise).</blockquote>

Made me want to get it. Seemed like one of those addictive fun games. To hell with Nebulas and their burning suns! Permadeath is fun though, makes it quite intense even though it is &quot;simplistic&quot;.<br />
EDIT: I found it is worth the money. Great timesink to have as each playthrough is different. Though all end the same with a No... no ... noooo, not... fire... stop... no... NOOO. awww.</blockquote>

</div>Just got to the &quot;boss&quot; mothership. Played on easy which is hard enough.<br />
<br />
Certainly not a boss you can beat by skipping quickly ahead. The whole &quot;attack weapons and grind them down with lasers&quot; doesn't work so well on a ship with multiple weapon parts. My last standing crewmember was my engineer who got upgraded to captain in the last levels. Got 2200ish points. <br />
<br />
At around the 5th or 6th jump to another system you unlock a new ship. Looking at the achievements, it might actually be very difficult to achieve 6 different races as crew members. I have only seen human, rock, mantis, engi, z something. Never gotten them in the same playthrough though. Not sure what the 6th race is.<br />
<br />
Only thing I wish is that there were a few more hints as to how to &quot;unlock&quot; things. Rushing towards the end is certainly pointless as I just experienced.</blockquote>

And, like the Wizard of Yendor, the &quot;end game&quot; is always the same encounter, but the context of that encounter depends entirely on your playthrough: what enhancements you have, your crew's expertise, the condition of your ship, etc.<br />
<br />
After a dozen playthroughs, I've tried a variety of offensive and defensive approaches, as well as exploratory and streamlined exploration. There are a lot of variables here :) I would not call this game shallow. Randomized for multiple re-experiencings, sure, but not shallow! :)</blockquote>

<br />
Last night, I ended up with poor circumstances that led to most of my crew kidnapped/blown-up/eaten by giant spiders. With just my pilot left, in sector 7 (where things are tough), I managed to fight off a ship:<br />
- with 3 levels of shields, despite my weapons only being half-available;<br />
- that sent 2 boarders to my ship;<br />
- that was chain-fire-beaming all of my important stuff.<br />
<br />
It's times like this that enhanced O2 generation is important and relevant. My generators were only running for 10-15 seconds at a time, before they were set on fire again. I barely won the fight, jumped to the next sector, and blew up while reading the dialogue.<br />
It never pays to leave the fires burning. I would call that a Pyrrhic Victory.<br />
<br />
I also managed to unlock two more ships in a single play-through. The randomization of the missions is pretty awesome. I'm always finding something *new*, or at least a new answer to a previously-seen problem/scenario.<br />
<br />
I still haven't beaten the final boss, despite having read some spoilers.</blockquote>

Was in the Red Tail (Kestrel Layout B)<br />

I though I had a good chance as I had a pretty solid ship layout --<br />
2 Burst lasers, 1 Hull smasher laser, Ion Bomb.<br />
<br />
3 levels of shields, Power was maxxed.<br />
Defense Drone 2.<br />

Cloaking/Teleport maxxed.  Med bay at 2<br />

I was hammering away at the first stage boss - had his missiles offline &amp; crew member dead through laser fire.  Decided things were taking to long &amp; he no longer had enough firepower to breach my shields &amp; do any damage so I pulled my pilot &amp; shield tech (both Human) &amp; transported them over to another room to both kill crew &amp; get his laser offline.  Well, they did it.  Unfortunately when they took the laser offline the boss had had enough - blew apart/FTL'ed out.  <br />
<br />
My crew now consists of 1 Zoltan &amp; 2 Engis.  <br />
<br />
Had to move one to the pilot seat obviously - It was not an ideal setting - but try try again.  I was one jump away from a repair facility &amp; had 75% hull left anyways - so I jumped to repair - then moved to engage the boss again.  <br />
<br />
This time things didn't go smoothly - my plan was to lockdown his drone bay with Ion bombs - Take the missiles out with the laser weapons &amp; just pound the piss out of him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1 failed, his first volley of missiles hit into my weapon bay, his anti-ship drones, &amp; lasers took down shields and knocked out my O2 system - and his boarding drone landed in my Engine compartment.  So I had a Zolton &amp; Engi trying to repel the boarding drone.  Lasers firing at his missiles still.  I reroute power to the ion bomb losing my hull laser.   His drone in my engine compartment reactivates.  Now I no longer have enough firepower to both penetrate his shields and do damage to the weapons array after.  and that &quot;Power Surge&quot; shit sucks asss.  Survived the first by cloaking through it.  but now, I can't get his weapons offline.  Take a missile to my cloak &amp; he surges again blasting my little bitty ship to smithereens.  <br />
<br />
If I wouldn't have lost my Mantis/Rockman boarding party earlier I might have had a chance.  As it was -- well, The Rebels won...   Again...  Oh well, maybe someday I'll actually make it to the 3rd stage.

First couple tries BRUTAL.  The Bulwark starts with 2 Missile launchers(NO Energy weapons), 3 rockmen for crew.<br />
<br />
First try; I got creamed: starved for ammo, starved for scrap, starved for fuel.  Only made it to sector 3.  <br />
<br />
2nd try, a little better.<br />

3rd try.  Bye bye flagship.  <div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">

<br />
So, I started up on the 3rd try.  Was rationing my missiles, managed to pick up a Transporter early on.  but then lost 1 of my crewmen in a random action (damned spiders).  So, two rockmen, My tactics actually became abandoning the Bulwark in favor of boarding.  Then I found a Firebomb.  Things became easy.  And I started picking up crew, better weapons blah blah blah, life is good.  <br />
<br />
Final weapons were 2 Ion Blast 2's, Pike Beam, Firebomb(had enough power to run both Ion's &amp; either beam or Bomb).  Anti-Ship Drone 1, Defense Drone 2, &amp; Hull repair drone 2 that I swapped in between combats.  <br />
<br />
basic tactics:  Both Ion's open fire on weapons (once shields are down and weapons locked down switch one to other system Shields usually) - If Medbay firebomb it -- Beam in 2 Rockman boarding team.  If no medbay firebomb some other 2 slot room like the Bridge.  Very rarely did I have to pull out my Rockmen due to low health.  and when I did their guys started running scared &amp; the fires ran rampant.<br />
<br />
On the boss - both Ion blasts went to autofireing 1 on Engine, 1 on Cloak.  Rockmen beamed into the Missile weapon for boarding action.  Then the Ion, then the Heavy laser.  at that Point I Firebombed the medbay - beamed my 2 rockmen in.  Interestingly, they left me alone -So  I firebombed the cloak, That got their attention.   worked my way through the blast doors.  took out door controls, and started killing their guys.  (did have to evac once to heal).  Left the guy manning the Beam weapon alive (per spoiler - crew carries from phase to phase.).  Easiest phase 1 I've ever done.  Shut down the Firebomb and sliced &amp; Diced with the Pike Beam.<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 2:  My boarders went directly to the drone bay - Ion weapons went to rapid fire against The missiles &amp; lasers. Their boarding drone landed in my weapons bay being manned by a Mantis &amp; Engi.   After the drone bay was knocked out got my boarding crew out, Pike beam fired up, along with Anti-Ship drone.  I did have to activate the Hull Repair drone during the Power Surge.  (did not manage to find a cloak for sale when I had the scrap to buy it).<br />
<br />
Phase 3:  Nothing to it.  No crew left onboard the flagship - Boarded to take out the weapons, Ion's fireing against the shields, Pike beam sliced em, anti-ship drone fired away.  <br />
<br />
Go FEDERATION!

I've been trying out the stealth ship - it starts with no shields! Definitely a challenge, but learning new tactics is fun :)</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I got crazy lucky on one playthrough and unlocked both the stealth ship and another. The stealth ship is *not* easy to use. The weapons are weak, and no shields, but it does start with cloaking ability. You can buy shields, but it's expensive - 150 scrap. The layout of the ship is rather nice, for what that's worth.<br />
<br />
I've used the Bulwark a few times, and it's definitely built to be a &quot;tank&quot; as opposed to a nimble fighter. I stacked mine with all the missile weapons I could find, ignored shields on the opposition, and scavenged for missiles whenever I could. It worked out well, but, of course, I was destroyed by the end boss ;)<br />
<br />
Most of my games aren't built to get to the end-game and beat the boss. Not yet, at least - I'm still exploring various combinations of the game. I fear that once I figure out a technique to win, I'll build all my ships to do that, and most of the fun will be sucked out. I still like the randomness of what you can find in the sectors (a la Nethack).</blockquote>
