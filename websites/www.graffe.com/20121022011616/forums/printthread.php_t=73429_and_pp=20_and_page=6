			<div class="message">Fair enough. I didn't see any cows there (doesn't mean there aren't any). Wood would have been easy enough to get a hold of. Ok, you have some diesel fuel. Let's assume you have access to a diesel vehicle. Now what? It's not like driving somewhere else is going allow you to escape your circumstances. Even with this technique they wouldn't be able to produce enough to run an army for any period of time. They had a pretty good setup where they were, relatively speaking. <br />
<br />
I would like to know what happened to the other houses though. Were they torn apart for lumber to stay warm or was the area just burned? Maybe the plane crashes destroyed the neighborhood and that one little cul-de-sac managed to survive the fire. It's not really important to the story, I know, but it's just one of those things.</div>

</div>It isn't about driving somewhere.  Without a tractor, one person can grow enough food for ~1.2 people.  With even an early 40s tractor, one man can grow enough for hundreds of people.</blockquote>

</div>Of course you can, but can you mass produce them to the precision needed to keep automatic weapons from jamming up? Heck, there's actually an ammunition factory really close to where they are in Joliet. Of course, none of the assembly lines will work for it. It's already been established that these weapons still exist, they just aren't going to be used by your average joe. Muskets are crude and fashioning bullets for them is simple.</blockquote>

</div>Depends on what the `it´ was they were referring to. Probably not that battery powered computer or the suppression field generating jewelbox thingy since that would have been obvious. Maybe something a much more intriguing like a device-node that generates the suppression field for that area.</blockquote>

But none of this matters after reaching the end of the show.

</div>I can't speak to the other stuff because I haven't seen the pilot yet, but in Minnesota, even FIVE years without electricity and a functioning infrastructure would almost completely destroy our state's road system in the twin cities at least.<br />
<br />
They spend a large portion of the year patching or resurfacing the major roads EVERY YEAR.<br />
<br />
The combination of cold shifting the roads for anywhere between 1/3 and 3/4 of the year depending on the year followed by hot, humid summers, also every year lead to things like a 2-lane-wide chunk of Interstate 94's concrete EXPLODING SKYWARD this summer after we had too many 100+ degree days. Anywhere that's not cement sees either cracking and shifting of the crushed pressurized rock or asphalt over the course of the seasonal changes, which in a single year can make some fairly impressive holes/cracks/gaps.</blockquote>

The presence of an internet bothered me a little as well, and I appreciate Branaman's idea that &quot;it&quot; might be referring to something else. I sincerely hope that is true, but I don't think it is. Sending super secret messages every time the militia is in town seems like a colossally stupid idea. Eventually a militia leader is going to walk in on someone doing that, and no one will be surprised.<br />

There's no way they are ditching that plot line by the way. They want a Twilight/Hunger Games crossover effect so bad it hurts. I'm serious, the stilted writing is giving me literal pains, he just awkwardly saves her once again in a situation he was responsible for. Sooo dreamy.<br />

Edit: Out of curiosity, what did your daughter think about it?</blockquote>

			<div class="message">I can't speak to the other stuff because I haven't seen the pilot yet, but in Minnesota, even FIVE years without electricity and a functioning infrastructure would almost completely destroy our state's road system in the twin cities at least.<br />
<br />
They spend a large portion of the year patching or resurfacing the major roads EVERY YEAR.<br />
<br />
The combination of cold shifting the roads for anywhere between 1/3 and 3/4 of the year depending on the year followed by hot, humid summers, also every year lead to things like a 2-lane-wide chunk of Interstate 94's concrete EXPLODING SKYWARD this summer after we had too many 100+ degree days. Anywhere that's not cement sees either cracking and shifting of the crushed pressurized rock or asphalt over the course of the seasonal changes, which in a single year can make some fairly impressive holes/cracks/gaps.</div>

</div>No, not just made the roads unusable. They're gone. Most of the greater Chicago area is grassland in the show. For instance, the only sign of O'Hare is one plane (which is in remarkably good condition for a world in which all of the roads have reverted to soil) and a really poor matte painting of a control tower in the background.</blockquote>
