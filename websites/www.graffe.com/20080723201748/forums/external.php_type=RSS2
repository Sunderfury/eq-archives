This week’s update will be a smaller maintenance one in order for us to tidy up a couple of the issues while we work on the next larger update which is currently being tested and hopefully will be ready for the live servers next week.<br />
<br />
Our tech team is hard at work to investigate about memory leaks (like for example the issue with your map going gray) and they have made inroads on those issues, and we have found and resolved a couple with this weeks update. This is of course a process that does not end now - on the contrary. The team will keep on working hard to find the leaks that are still there so we can expect more of them to be resolved in updates to come. Finding such memory leaks is quite a tricky thing but we are making progress and the tech team is keeping the focus on this issue.<br />
<br />
Also fixed should be the issues from last week was the behavior of caster pets as some of them were in fact quite passive after they had been summoned. Our developers have found the source of that issue and the fix for this is getting tested by QA so this week's update should resolve this issue.<br />
Updated Information: <br />
Unfortunately the pet fix has slipped out due to an issue with the fix that requires it to be looked into a little more. So it should hopefully be in next weeks update.<br />
<br />
Lastly with this week’s update we wanted to give you all the opportunity to revise your feat points given the recent changes to the abilities and feat trees. What we have done is that the counter of how many times a character has reset his feats will be set to zero so the next reset will be viewed as being the first one in terms of money it will cost, as if you had never reset any feats before. <br />
<br />
<br />
As we mentioned at the top, the update planned for next week should include some additions and changes that our community has been looking forward to (beside the usual fixes and updates). <br />
<br />
Instance Changes<br />
<br />
There are for example changes to the Pyramid of the Ancients dungeon which include wide improvements of the encounters and dangers that can be found in the pyramid. We really think that this will make it an interesting dungeon and should provide a real challenge for solo players.<br />
<br />
Next up is Toirdebach’s Tomb in The Fields of the Dead. This group instance has been tweaked so that the mob levels are more in keeping with the level of the Fields of the Dead. We have also been through and amended the placement of mobs in the dungeon so that the balance between ranged and melee opponents should be much fairer to groups trying to tackle this ancient evil!<br />
<br />
Resource Zone Updates<br />
<br />
The resource and building zones (Lacheish Plains, Purple Lotus Swamp and Poitain) have had a thorough repopulation based on player feedback as to what resources were problematic. New resource nodes and many new camps have been added to these zones to help the avid tradeskillers amongst you find what you need. Be warned though venturing too far off the beaten path may result in you finding yourself face to face with some dangerous foes who won’t take kindly to you trying to harvest from them!<br />
<br />
<br />
These fixes will be made available on the Testlive server later this week. So if you are interested in checking out these changes beforehand make sure you connect to the Testlive servers.<br />
<br />
Please bear in mind that all these updates will of course be tested in detail before we decide whether they can be made available for the live servers. But we will keep you up to date about the latest status.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can discuss this news in the forums right here.</div>

<br />
The invitation process is easy. You need to log-in to your account pages (<a href="https://register.ageofconan.com" target="_blank">https://register.ageofconan.com</a>), and choose “Buddy program”. Follow the on-screen instructions, and then write a personal message to your friends if you so desire.<br />
<br />
We recommend that you lend your install DVDs to your buddy to get him or her ready to play as fast as possible. Alternatively your buddy will be offered a $2,99/€2,99 client download with 3 additional days of playtime to cover the download time.<br />
<br />
While this offer is only for Collector’s Edition accounts for now, we will soon open up for the Buddy key found in the standard retail box as well.</div>

</div>Sucky for those of us who bought retail, looks like we got the shaft.  not sure why they wouldn't open all buddy keys.</div>

				P2P-Next partners include the BBC, Delft University of Technology, the European Broadcasting Union, Lancaster University, Markenfilm, Pioneer and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, intend to develop a Europe-wide &quot;next-generation&quot; internet television distribution system, based on P2P and social interaction.

</div>There was a larger article in the Norwegian newspaper, but I just googled an English source, <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/87182_p2p_next_live_bittorrent_streaming/" target="_blank">http://www.circleid.com/posts/87182_...ent_streaming/</a><br />
<br />
Reason I am posting this is because we've had several threads earlier about torrent traffic, and how some tele-companies are slowing/not accepting bit torrent traffic. But with this in the works, how would that go about? The Norwegian news sort of angled this towards being the nightmare come reality for movie/music organizations who try to make it out like bit torrent is making their artists turn into starving children from Africa.<br />
<br />
The system the P2P TV is set to utelize is something they call Give-To-Get, <a href="http://www.tribler.org/Give-To-Get" target="_blank">http://www.tribler.org/Give-To-Get</a> <br />
<br />
With this being implemented I don't see how Europe now can go the route of the American companies who slow bit-torrent traffic.</div>

				<a href="http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Real-Ghostbusters-Time-Life-Complete-Series/9711" target="_blank">Tvshowsondvd.com </a>reports that Time-Life is going to distribute a massive 26-disc DVD collection of the 1986 cartoon series The Real Ghostbusters.<br />
<br />
Based on the hit 1984 movie, the show follows the continuing adventures of Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston as they rid every paranormal spook in New York City.<br />
<br />

<br />
We're doing London, Paris, Rome, Naples, Capri, Rome again and then Madrid all in 21 days.  Staying at some wicked hotels, doing some shopping, a little sight-seeing and our two best men are joining us for the end of the trip from Naples onwards.<br />
<br />
I grew up dirt poor on a little farm in mid-west Canada so the fact that my first trip overseas comes at age 36 means I'm pretty excited about the whole thing!<br />
<br />
Talk to you all when I'm back!<br />
<br />
p.s. wedding was fabulous, new job is better than I expected and actually interesting enough to keep me mostly off Graffes during the day :)<br />
<br />
hugs,<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Firstly, It WILL have high sales. This is a historical event in gaming. Forget Halo or Final fantasy whatever for &quot;most anticipated game&quot;. Those are in the running of &quot;issue to Issue&quot; when this one is &quot;of the CENTURY. &quot;<br />
<br />
Secondly: <br />
<br />
They've had fourteen years. If they don't have epic gameplay that matches the level of concepts in the last two trailers we've seen, I think the gaming industry is creatively doomed, and my Mission becomes that much more clear in the industry. The consistency seems to be in big ideas, and hopefully they are implemented well. <br />
<br />
But it's Duke: I expect Kickass weapons, Lots of Gibbing, and lots of naughtyness and jokes at other games....they've also had ten years to make fun of others.</div>

				Hello Hellgaters,<br />
<br />
I know everyone is looking for an announcement, and we'd love to make one -- but right now, many things are in flux and we don't have all the information yet. As soon as we do, we'll post here on the forums, on the website, and anywhere else we can find you.<br />
<br />
In the short term, please do not worry. The game is up, the servers are not going away in the short term and any major changes to status will be communicated in advance.<br />
<br />
I'd like to ask for your patience as we try to figure it all out and chart a new course. We value your community, your commitment, and your passion for Hellgate and we will make sure that any solution that we architect will support all of you as best as we are able.<br />
<br />
Thanks again. We hope to have a real announcement shortly.<br />
