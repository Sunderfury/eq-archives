PD is not an aa to increase crit rates ? And all along thats what I thought it was.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, do you actually subscribe to the masochistic mindset that a burst discipline should lower your total damage output? Because that is what pd does atm. That is the double standard that no other class who has a burst discipline endures. <br />
<br />
In every other case a burst discipline increases your dps temporarily while having that extra damage ADD to the damage that would have occured if no disc was used. <br />
<br />
<br />
PD otoh, lowers our total damage by a large amount while offering us a mere 40% greater chance to crit. The above suggestion is completely justified.</div>

Yes innate, and the 2.0 has a &quot;Chance&quot; for 8 last I checked, it doesn't always or maybe even most of the time end up being lower than 8. If i'm in error, please show otherwise i'm simply going on what i've picked up.<br />

Of course I do, I also realize that Vishimtar cloak is 50%, and Vampiric Fire is 60%. What i'm talking about is the added damage that Ro's/Eci's/Druzzil's greater familiar also adds, so instead of having to switch between currently 4 diffrent familiar's. It could all be jumbled into 1, as a prismatic and instead of the current 25% we currently get off of 1 spell focus familiar. We would get 50%, which in my opinion would give us the edge again in burst parses.<br />

That's the idea, while I would like to see a permanant version of it. That would indeed be a bit overpowering in my opinion, but I would be happy with a version of it without a penalty to further extend our use in burn fights even without a timer reduction. But the timer reduction would be nice, maybe time between fights increases even more in Deathkneel and Demiplane of Blood. But right now in Anguish the averege time for my guild between bosses is about 25 minutes roughly.<br />

Not in the least, how fast do we burn thru 3500 mana even with the best mana preservation items availble? Keep in my mind not every Wizard out there has my 13.6k or your 14k(buffed lead aa's etc?). So thier return would be less for say a casual or lower end Wizard raider.<br />

Makes me happy in the pants just thinking about it. It's okay though, the rogues,berserkers and monks will pass us 5-10 minutes later on long fights. Which most of the high end fights are from what i've gathered. Past Demiplane of Blood.<br />

Yeah it is, would be nice now wouldn't it. As long as it proc'd more often than not, I would be happy with it. In it's current form for me at least, it lowers my DPS not increases it. And is for the most part for me at least, nothing more than a spell to make spell crit eyecandy with. Sometimes it'll proc 3 times in a row (Rarley), and most of the time i'll use it 5-6 times before I see a proc.<br />

		<div>Ok, I only skimmed the thread but I'll throw in my 2 cents, and as a bonus I'll give the devs an idea of where I am and my guild's progression in an attempt to give them a better idea of where I am coming from.<br />
Level: 70<br />
AA: ~400<br />
Guild Progression: Working through CoA named but have not gotten to MataMuram yet, Killed Yar'Lir, can clear all of Tacvi<br />
<br />
1.  I want an upgrade to Improved Invis.  Self target only, an AA that can match the apilities of Rogue's Shroud of Stealth.  Short reuse timer say 15 mins.  Could also make it snare ME for balance.  Make it long duration too say 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
2. I like the idea of a MGB type AA that lets me TL an entire raid to any TL spell I have.  Could even make it take the same number of portal stones as the number of people in range.  Would provide some kind of limitation to it.<br />
<br />
3. I want a MUCH upgraded Mind Crash.  Shorter reuse timer, more agro reduction, even faster cast time.<br />
<br />
4. Along the same lines I would like to see an AA (with a long reuse timer say 72 mins) that lets me &quot;mega&quot; Mind Crash a mob and remove ALL agro it has on me.  So if I get agro running somewhere I have the option of rooting/snaring it and wiping me off it's agro list totally.  This would obviously help in a raid, maybe too much, so you could limit it to only work on a mob that has NOT been damaged by anyone.<br />
<br />
5.  Ability to take a group to my Secondary bind point like Teleport Bind to primary bind point.</div>

That's all I can think of for now.  My last plea would be to not take these ideas and hand them out to other classes after we come up with them.  Like spell haste given to clerics, mana flare given to enchanters, group mana regeneration kicker given to enchanters (PoR aura is the group familiar idea presented here months ago).  All those other classes already have much more to offer to a group already than we do.  Please don't take the utility that could be given to wizards and farm it away to other classes again.</div>

		<div>I didn't mean to be insulting, but all of those suggestions were pretty much unreasonable.  Only &quot;Hastened Prolonged destruction, reduces the the reuse to 36 minutes at the top rank&quot; is something that could be implemented, and that is without the &quot;Mastery&quot; AA.<br />
<br />
They already said that new AAs are going to be based on the Gates model, small increases for a high cost.  Don't think of 50%.  Think of five levels of 1% boost each, for 10 AAs per level.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm sure we'll see some of that as part of the level increase.  A new familiar would make sense.  More mana, and hp of course.</div>

		<div>I have readen many nice things in these posts.<br />
<br />
My whishes :<br />
<br />
<b>1) Please give us diversity ! </b><br />
<br />
In the past, when we had to choose between alternatives, it has usually been a waste (specialization: we all took the same, Gods : you see what I mean , faction : we don t care but maybe cov/geant long ago, DoN side : even evil classes are on &quot;good&quot; side mostly).<br />
<br />
But I still like the idea of diversity for a given class. I would like to see a choice between lines of AA, balanced enough so not all players take the same one.<br />
Some ideas : not sure about the content, just examples :<br />
<br />
Line &quot;efficiency&quot; :<br />
- less mana cost // decap evocation<br />
- less resist<br />
- an AA with free mana low DD (1000 damage) with low reuse time<br />
<br />
Line &quot;damages&quot; :<br />
- bonus on DD<br />
- bonus on critik rate<br />
- an AA with free mana high DD (5000 damage) with long reuse time<br />
<br />
Line &quot;subltlety&quot; :<br />
- less agro (must be noticeable)<br />
- fixed IvU or rogue's like sos<br />
- an AA with free mana dot <br />
<br />
A hard long boring quest would allow a change of choice after you made one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>2) Mana burn/blaze</b><br />
<br />
Wizard still like the flashy big boum :)<br />
<br />

		<div>I see mainly 3 pillars that need work for Wizards: Mana Regen, Hate reduction and Damage output.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen:<br />
<br />
- Fix the orignal Harvest versions or create a new version e.g. Harvest of Ro (3/6/9) 500/750/1000 mana, recast 5 minutes, cast time 10 sec, no stun component<br />
- Upgrade our Familiars with Mana regen - Devoted Familiar should be upped to 15 Mana per tick if not even 18 - the Foci Familiars should be upped to 8 mana per tick<br />
<br />
Hate reduction:<br />
<br />
2 possibilities...<br />
a.) A new Concussion (name idea: &quot;Oblivion&quot;) spell which should decrease hate by 1000 else same cast time and mana cost as AGC (2 secs / 25 mana)<br />
or...<br />
b.) Lower the reuse of Mind Crash significantly down to 9 minutes - something like &quot;Advanced Hastened Mind Crash&quot; (6/9/12), lowers the reuse time of the Hastened Mind Crash by further 25% per rank.<br />
This would have more impact on long duration fights where you build up significant aggro overtime<br />
<br />
- Fix the Silent Casting at last level from random to a certain guaranteed Hate reduction in the range of at least 70%+<br />
<br />
I personally would prefer a new Concussion spell overall since it would have generally more impact and utility<br />
<br />
Damage Output:<br />
<br />
- &quot;Advanced Quick Damage&quot; (3/6/9), Lowers the casting time of all your damage spells by 5%,10% and 15%<br />
- &quot;Prismatic Focus&quot; (5/10), lowers the resist modifier on all your damage spells by 50 and 100<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
- Up the damage of Mana Weave and Gelidin Comet to same base damage as Corona Flare. This would give us more of a freedom which to use<br />
- &quot;Freeze&quot; (3/6/9), same as Pyromancy just for Cold based spells<br />
- As for new damage spell in the next expansion &quot;Frost Strike&quot; (or whatever name) with around same base damage as Ether Flame<br />
<br />
<br />
General Utility<br />
<br />
- &quot;Project Teleport&quot; (10), after activation your next Translocate spell will send all players in range to the destination of your Translocate, same mods as regular Teleport<br />
- Spell:Second Recall Teleport, sends all players in range to your Secondary Bind spot, same mods as regular Teleport<br />
<br />
<br />
So as summary for the upcomming expansion:<br />
New Spells: Oblivion, Frost Strike, Second Recall Teleport<br />
New AAs: Harvest of Ro, Advanced Quick Damage, Prismatic Focus, Freeze, Project Teleport<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp on the matter.<br />

		<div>two things i really liked about wow that eq is missing... instacast nukes, they were not the big bang fireworks, but if you needed something dead NOW you could tap that spell and bam, instant damage.  second, our blink spell (i.e. shadow step line) was directional in the way you were facing.  BIG difference.  that was always in my lineup, very useful and often used.  the recast for both the instanukes and blink were longer than other spells but they were there when you needed them.</div>

		<div><b>Spellcasting Overhaste</b><br />
A one minute duration group buff which acts to supplement the current line of cleric spellhaste spells.<br />
It would work to do so by reducing the recast timer by a percentage (25%) for spells <i>where recast timer is less than 180</i>.<br />
<br />
A buff like this is great for two reasons. It would be highly coveted by wizards wanting to do better burst dps. And it would also be highly coveted by all casters, healers, knights, caster dps as well. <br />
<br />
So this gives us utility and yet remains focused on improving our damage capability.<br />
<br />
Standard recast is 2.25 secs. with 25% recast lowered that comes down to 1.6875secs. Heals come sooner. Dps goes up.<br />
<br />
DPS on Ancient Core Fire chained.<br />
If someone's regular setup has them casting acf in 5.5 secs unfocused <br />
With  0% recast reduction, we're getting 525 dps.<br />
With 20% recast reduction, that's up to 558 dps.<br />
With 25% recast reduction, that's up to 566 dps.</div>

		<div>An idea I had, reposted from a discussion in another topic thread:<br />
<br />
How about a Wizard gets a nuke that does 500 DD. When cast, it places a buff in the target's buff box that indicates &quot;Level One&quot; of that spell. Next time the Wizard casts the same DD spell, it does 1K DD, and the buff is overwritten with a buff indicating &quot;Level Two&quot; of that spell. If the target has the Level Two icon and is hit by the same spell, it does 2K DD and the buff is overwritten with a &quot;Level Three&quot; icon. Put in five levels, and the spell would do up to 16K per nuke, but no crit capacity or focus will work (like the old dragon/giantbane nukes). Or four levels for up to 8K per nuke, but with the normal crit/focus capacity. At max level, the buff would become ablative, meaning it would fade after being nuked with that same spell.<br />
<br />
That would allow Wizards to nuke for high damage, low mana on raids, but without infinite stackability, since they would not each get their own buff icon, but would be overwriting for each other on a single buff icon. It would take a single Wizard multiple casts to ramp the buff up, and the final buff icon would not be over-writable, but would fade after being hit with again at max level, requiring another ramp-up. Raiding Wizards would like doing loads of DPS for low mana costs, and grouping Wizards would like doing large nukes for moderate mana costs (the nuke itself, which would do 500 DD at Level Zero, would be around 250 mana per cast, which would become as efficient as CoF at Level One, subsequent levels would bring the mana cost down well below that of CoV). In group settings, the more hitpoints/longer fight times per mob, better this nuke would be. In raid settings, the Wizzies could coordinate to use the tactic of timing their nukes so that they ramped the level up to maximum as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
That would give Wizzies a finitely-stackable instant DD line that could be high-damage/high-efficiency, but would not be immediately overpowering, and the finite stackability would favor raiding parties with five Wizards per raid, though fewer or more Wizards would still be able to use it, just not at peak efficiency. That would make Wizards desirable but not in large numbers like the current DD model.</div>

		<div>This whole thread sounds alot like disciplines.<br />
<br />
Wait, I know people hate seeing disciplines attached to casters.  So let's just call them, caster specializations, er maybe that's taken already.  NM, it'll never sell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Timer 1: offensive abiliities  (increase dps!)<br />
Timer 2: defensive abilities  (Mana conservation, less dps)<br />
Timer 3: avoidance abilities (deaggro, lower aggro)<br />
Timer 4: misc healing / pulling abilities (or mana regen!!)<br />
<br />
<br />

				Here's an idea for a future spell line:<br />
<br />
A &quot;Damage Sword&quot; in the same vein of Damage Shields.<br />
<br />
Where Mages are the masters of the DS and even &quot;burst&quot; DSs out there for Druids and Mages, they can keep that field. Even clerics with their reverse damage shield where the mob takes damage for every swing it makes. Why not have us reflect the cleric, like we have many times in the past? (The whole destruction/healing mirror).<br />
<br />
I would like to see a new line for wizards where the mob takes damage for every swing made against it. (At least, I'm fairly sure this doesn't exist yet.)<br />
<br />
Call the spell something like &quot;Burn Armor&quot;, &quot;Festering Fire&quot; or &quot;Burden of Lightning&quot;. *shrug*<br />
Have it cost perhaps... 100-200 mana.<br />
And then every time a successful melee hit is made against the mob, it takes an extra 2-5+ damage or whatever is deemed proper. It wouldn't stack up like other DSs though, so only one on the mob at a time.<br />
<br />
This would give the grouping wizard utility, the soloing wizard wouldn't be helped much if at all and the raiding wizard would still be able to focus soley on nuking with one wizard designated for this spell. Could also make it retro-active and give it to lower level wizards in a smaller form if they pull a Luclin and add it in like familiars.<br />
<br />
And of course, it would be aggro free like DSs, still keeping in the &quot;detrimental&quot; form of the wizard and something new without stepping on any toes.<br />
<br />
Just an idea.

I should have put that in this thread (rather than <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=40527&amp;page=3" target="_blank">that</a> one) in the first place.  Ah well.<br />
<br />
Also just to be noted, it isn't a reverse damage shield.  Those trigger when the mob successfully hits a PC, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
Clerics also have a version where players are healed when they hit a mob, so why not a wizard version that does a &quot;Damage Sword&quot; (or whatever you want to call it) where it is almost as if it a small nuke (though in DS format) when they hit a mob?</div>

		<div>I always liked the idea of a Planar Pocket AA, the idea that its a wizzie DA that phases the wiz out of existence and into another plane for some short duration.  They could give it some downside like inherent blindness if they must but I think it would be a very handy tool for wizzies who feel the aggro coming and I like the idea as far as lore of wizzies goes.</div>
