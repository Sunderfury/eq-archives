I understand that high levels were blowing through it for the easy 20s but at this point now it's not even worthwhile to do a lot of story modes because you will end up losing more gold then you start with because of repair costs being higher then what you can earn.</blockquote>

</div>That's funny. I've enjoyed both the dungeons I've done, but CM by far felt like the better balanced low level dungeon. It's no surprise people were speed running it for money and experience, and thus no surprise to me it got nerfed. It seemed to be unnaturally popular. <br />

</div>This is just stupid though. There's got to be a way to discourage the path of least resistance types without hurting those doing it at the starting level range.<br />
<br />
You guys mentioned diminishing returns, is that the base of the nerf? Because they already did that with events and honestly I don't think that's a huge deal. It just means you can't sit there and grind something. But diminishing returns combined with lower returns in the first place is stupid.<br />
