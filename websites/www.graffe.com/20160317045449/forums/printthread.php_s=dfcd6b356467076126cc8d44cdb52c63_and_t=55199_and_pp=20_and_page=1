</div>Yes, but in fact, what they decided was that the website would focus on the latest, breaking stuff — in other words, dot-com would be the repository of hard news — and the newspaper would have analyses and features. Murdoch has said he wants to change that, to some extent, so the newspaper has more newsy stuff and the website has more &quot;oomph,&quot; if you will.</blockquote>
