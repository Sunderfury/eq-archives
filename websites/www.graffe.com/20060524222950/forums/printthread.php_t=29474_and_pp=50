		<div>Well Iv been having a problem now with my quest book, in fact the problem is one one that I created but can't undo.  Here it goes, what happened was I was issued a Wholesaler task, I don't remember what it was but it said I finished it, I go to turn it in and I can't.  Nothing happens, Iv been to both the npc's in the crafting centers that I'm a member of and tried to turn in, But I can't, I probably along the way in a area where I was not playing allot sold them to a vendor or sold them at my house market, or maybe even destroyed them its hard to tell(As I started the quest back in November).  But the bottom line is I don't know what it was I was going to make or harvest.  So in a effort to restart my task's I send in a CS Ticket(petition) to have them aid with the problem, and id request that they just delete the quest for me, because for some odd reason I can't.  Why would I post here<br />
<br />
#1) Because every SOE CS Rep I talk to tells me to ask my fellow players for help, so I need one of you to delete this from my quest log or tell me what It is I need to make, because I forgot two months ago.(Probably cant right, so thank you SOE for nothing)<br />
#2) I think its very annoying the way this rep took my problem to handle, he simply responded though the ticket and never gave me a chance to add comments to his or to maybe make clear what it is that I wanted before he shut my door.  In fact to tell the truth this reminds me of the Support I get from HP from India and they suck.  Just the tone of the msg the open/close/solved and I got to get to the next 10,000 of these because I'm the only one SOE paid to handle ALL the tickets.<br />
<br />
Anyway take a look at this screen shot of his response.  SOE's support has gone down hill from the day they took it over from Variant.  And it looks like they want my money but don't want to help with my problem,s not to mention it was five hours before this one got answered and the one I placed in JUST after this still has not gone answered. (And thats over 15 hours) Thank god I'm not stuck in the ground or somthing. <br />
<br />
I love how he says he's sorry three times then makes no effor to help me, He rather just pass me off to the &quot;Players knowlage&quot;.<br />
<br />
On the left is my Quest Journal, I have the task selected that I am having problems with and note how I can't delete it, and it don't tell me anything about what the task was, so I can restart.  Then on the right is my coments sent into SOE, and a responce by GM Vivido<br />

		<div>You do realize that the support you get IS from India right? SOE outsourced all their GM services about 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
Wholesaler and workshop task quests requires you to have the material you gathered / crafted on you to hand in. You simply will have to restart the quests if you sold the items. It's made this way so you can't simply finish the task, sell off what you harvested, and get quick silver, gold from the quest while not handing out anything. Strange that you can't delete the quest though, just repetition and hope for a better GM.<br />
<br />
You also have to realize that this is the same GM team from Everquest that got outsourced to India. While the developers and Moorgard are much better then their EQ counterpart, the GM team is still the same old, same old. You think you had a weird response? Try explaining to the GM that your shard was locked in an expired instanced zone which were bugged at the time, and that he doesn't understand that a bug exists and kept repeating the same 2-3 lines about how you can click the door for the shard. Guildmate had to repetion to get a competent GM to summon the shard.</div>

		<div>You can switch tasks once every 24 hours or so before you &quot;complete&quot; the task.  After you completed the task I think your shit outa luck unless you know what you made and get that number of items on your person when you hail the NPC.  I've also /bugged that we are unable to delete tradeskill quests like that several times.  Do you have any clue what items you needed to make?   If so you need to keep those items on you when you hail the NPC to get the coin/credit.  Do you by chance keep logging on?  Might go back and look, though this might be very time consuming to sort out.<br />

<br />
If you paid for eq2players you can check your level on Nov.23, but assuming you started near launch you were most likely 10-19 and Tier 2.  Wholesalers want 15 of 1 of 6 items, you will need to buy (really cheap) or gather the possible items.  You can kill animals instead of harvesting nodes for pelts.<br />
<br />
Tier 1 : tin, lead, malachite, root, elm, sullied lq pelt<br />
Tier 2 : iron, electrum, turquoise, tuber, maple, sullied avg pelt<br />
<br />
Wholesaler Tasks aren't deletable to prevent people from being able to simply cycle the quest until they got the easiest task.  There is a 5 min delay for changing your task from the Wholesaler.  Obviously more than 5 min have elapsed and you can't change your task, this is an issue with changing Tiers, you have levelled to 22 (Tier 3) adventurer and this prevents the Wholesaler from deleting your Tier 1 or 2 gathering task.  Levelling as an artisan can also change your Tier if it's higher than your adventurer level.<br />
<br />
The GM you spoke to should be aware of the changing Tier issue and should have sent you a canned response on that topic, you probably know more than me about where to submit the complaint about poor CS if you want to call out the GM for his failure.<br />
<br />
The issues with this could be simplified by leaving open the Collect 15 ______ step and simply place a check mark beside it and then show the next step as return to wholesaler.  I've had the issue when running low on bag space and trying to remember which item I need to keep to complete the task and would be handy to know I need carbonite and can delete all my belladonna and sullied pelts.</div>

		<div>Looked at the SS again and it says you created all the items for the Wholesaler, that's the text for Workshop Tasks, not Wholesaler Tasks.  Most likely you just got the Quest before the Text was updated and it's indeed a Wholesaler Task and simply gathering the items will complete the quest and net you 3 or 12sp.<br />
<br />
I've never done a Workshop Task and have no idea if they were an either or quest along with Gathering Tasks initially.  If that is a crafting task you will need to get ahold of a useful GM to delete the quest or get lucky crafting low level items.  The only chance to find out what item you were crafting would be if you take a lot of SS, in which case you can check those and you would probably have a SS or 3 with the text of the task or inspecting a pair of burlap mitts you made for the quest long ago.<br />
<br />
I still wouldn't think it was crafting though, I couldn't really see any reason you would finish making your last crafting item and then leave without hailing the Wholesaler, but stranger things have happened.</div>

		<div>The first line of GM response is almost certainly outsourced, and they seem to <i>always</i> respond with a canned message on the general topic, without any regard to the text of your petition where you explicity say you did all the things they are now suggesting you do. If you are lucky, you can get further action on the second round where they actually pay attention to you, and if you are really lucky, you get one of the local GM's who actually can do something for you. It's just like insurance companies, they try to filter out all the stupid petitions by adding a few levels of automatic responses. Trouble is, it makes it difficult for legit concerns to get through in a timely way...which I can't help but think is also deliberate. People just say, &quot;the heck with it,&quot; and don't follow through, so there is less for them to have to worry about.<br />
<br />
Which all boils down to lousy customer service, in my view. You shouldn't have to work so hard to get proper attention, even if you are being stupid and your case has no merit (which isn't what is going on here, to be perfectly clear). You are a paying customer, and due at least common courtesy and proper attention - not an ill-considered canned response.</div>

<br />
Just the other day we had a bad pull, evaced and a group member had left a shard but did not die, it was strange...anyway there was no shard for him to retreive so he petitioned and it was given back to him in 45min...<br />
<br />
If you guys are gonna complain about CS, EQ2 is not the game for doing it.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with EQ2's Customer service.  I don't care if they operate out of Iran, the job is getting done as of right now.<br />
<br />
In the case of glinlor's ticket, it looks to me like he got the quest updates from harvesting but sold or destroyed the items before talking to the wholesaler.  If that's the case all you have to do is buy some from the broker and you should be good to go.</div>

		<div>I think the real key would be to simply re-petition w/ a more descriptive overview of the problem and why you can't finish or delete or get a new TS Task.<br />
<br />
If you do an updated petition, you will also likely get a different CS rep, and in ANY customer service organization there is always the one guy who is horrid.<br />
<br />
Just give more detail like exactally what the problem is.  (like what you did on this board)<br />
<br />
I bet you they fix it if they can.  Also, did you actually follow their advice and /bug it?  It may be that the way the system is that CS reps cannot modify quests, if such it true, /bug may be the only way to get it fixed.<br />
<br />
A great example is that there was a bug awhile ago that if you auto banked something from the bank it would disapear.  I /bugged it.  About 2 weeks later, I found a bunch of the stuff I had lost in my overflow slot.  About 2 months later I found a couple more things :).<br />
<br />
Give it a good /bug that is very descriptive on how exactally to reproduce your problem and do the same on a petition.<br />
<br />
I agree w/ someone else who said &quot;i love how the description of your problem which you gave to us was quite detailed and informative...nothing at all like the CS ticket you turned in...&quot;<br />
<br />
Reading what you posted in your ticket I would interpret that you simply do not understand how to finish the quest.  Passing you off to getting help from your players is exactally what I would do.  It isn't a CS reps job to walk you through a quest.  &quot;I can't figure out how to do step X&quot;.  Now I understand by your post here that understanding how to finish the quest isn't the problem.  But by what is said in your ticket, I would have responded just as they did.</div>

Hey fanboy, that was my 3rd petition.  They have a history of the past ones, anyway they should have responded to me.  I was online, I saw the ticket update and I could not add to anything further, in fact when I made that I was fully expecting a responce, not what you see in that screen shot, further more I was never given the chance to talk to them.   And don't even get me started on the 5+ hours ot took to answer it.  AND furthemore they keep telling me to ask my fellow players.  So, if you have all the info now you tell me what to do. I'll be waiting So if you want to make smart ass comments you better have all your ducks in a line and stop asumeing that I did post all the history with the CS here.  They had all this info and more, they know everything that I said here.   And that was the last responce I got, right now Iv had a CS ticket in for three days and I missed the GM two times, one responded while I was at work in vendor mode and the other responded at 11:40pm when I was in bed, again in vendor mode.  So, this is still open although the two trys to back in touch with me are nice</div>

		<div>You should be able to reasonably estimate what tier level the collection quest was from, you just have to know what lvl your wholeseller society was back in novemeber.  After that you can just go and buy 15 of each type of common harvest from that tier.  I suspect its prob tier 1 components so your best bet would be to buy 15 iron lead machalite and whichever the tier 1 wood is again I forget.  I agree you shouldn't have to do that  and its easily fixed by putting the item name in the message telling you to go back to your wholeseller.</div>

Sure, i'll tell you what to do:<br />
Pay attention to what you're doing while you're in game.<br />
<br />
If you hadn't disposed of whatever it was your wholesaler wanted, you wouldn't be having this problem, now would you? I mean, c'mon, the quest tells you explicitly that the wholesaler wants you to bring back X number of items, common sense would tell you that you would have to have X number of items with you when you returned to the wholesaler to collect your reward. Did you really expect to receive a reward without turning in the required items?<br />
<br />
So here you are, the venerable Glinlor, crying waaah, waaah, waaah because you weren't paying attention to what you were doing, and you mucked things up.<br />

		<div>The second Tier of wholesaler tasks ask you to CREATE something . They don't actually mention that you have to bring them back. They are not gathering quests once you change to the second wholesaler society. It is not really possible to buy 15 of every thing he could ask you to create.<br />
<br />
The suggestion of mentoring won't work. Mentoring affects your adventurer level not your tradeskiller level. <br />
<br />
All that said the wholesaler tasks are not a big deal. Just ignore it until you get to the next level society and you can get new quests from them. <br />

In Everquest at one point they had a Email your GM thing. I always got better service that way. Do they have that in EQ2?</div>

Do you remember what you ate for dinner back on November 12th of 2004?  I don't think so, and in all that crap you posted you never once said anything useful, unless you simply could not resist the chance to try and flame me and you did a poor job of that as well. Anyway when I came back after some time of being away from the game I probably did sell them not knowing or remembering what they were for.  And anyway I never said It wasn't my fault did I? I made that point very clear, what I needed help with was fixing the problem, and my <b>original post was not really about my problem so much as the lack of help I was getting from SOE support to help me solve my problem</b>.   <br />
