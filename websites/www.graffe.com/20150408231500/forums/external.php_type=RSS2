			WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (CBSNewYork/AP) &#8212;  A woman convicted of killing her 5-year-old son by poisoning him with a lethal dose of salt was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison Wednesday morning.<br />
<br />
Lacey Spears, 27, of Scottsville, Kentucky, was found guilty last month of second-degree murder in the 2014 death of Garnett-Paul Spears at a suburban New York hospital.<br />
<br />
When asked by the judge whether she she&#8217;d like to say anything before sentencing, Spears replied, &#8220;No sir.&#8221; She displayed no emotion at the moment of sentencing.<br />
<br />
Prosecutors said Spears fed her son large amounts of salt through a gastrointestinal feeding tube, causing brain swelling, seizures and death. They believe she administered the salt at their home in Rockland County, as well as in his room at Nyack Hospital in Nyack after he was admitted for seizures. He died Jan. 23, 2014, after being transferred to Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla.<br />
<br />
The boy had a special feeding tube in his abdomen that was left over from an illness he had in infancy, which provided Spears with the ability to sicken her son at their home in Chestnut Ridge and then fatally poison him during subsequent hospital stays, prosecutors said.<br />
<br />
Prosecutors alleged Spears purposely sickened the boy to gain attention on social media and called her &#8220;a calculated child killer.&#8221; Her actions were &#8220;nothing short of torture,&#8221; one prosecutor said. &#8220;The motive is bizarre, the motive is scary, but it exists.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The defense tried to blame the hospital, saying the boy was dehydrated while in its care. One defense lawyer said there was &#8220;no direct evidence&#8221; of a crime.<br />
<br />
Spears did not testify at the trial.<br />
<br />
At Wednesday&#8217;s sentencing, prosecutors sought the the maximum sentenced, 25 years to life. The minimum sentence was 15 to life.<br />
<br />
Acting state Supreme Court Justice Robert Neary split the difference. He said Spears&#8217; crime was &#8220;unfathomable in its cruelty&#8221; and brought her son &#8220;five years of torment and pain.&#8221; But he said he was not imposing the maximum 25 years to life because &#8220;one does not have to be a psychiatrist to realize you suffer from Munchausen by proxy.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&#8220;By not imposing the maximum sentence, I&#8217;m combining punishment with something that you really did not exhibit towards your son, namely mercy,&#8221; Neary said.<br />
<br />
Munchausen by proxy is a disorder in which, in some cases, caretakers purposely but secretly harm children and then enjoy the attention and sympathy they receive.<br />
<br />
Spears&#8217; attorneys had refused to raise the disorder as a defense, and both sides agreed not to mention it at trial.<br />
<br />
Her attorneys balked at the mention of mental illness and immediately filed an appeal after the sentencing, CBS2&#8217;s Lou Young reported.<br />
<br />
&#8220;We&#8217;re not pleased, certainly in light of the fact that we asked for the minimum sentence and certainly in light of the fact that Lacey maintains her innocence,&#8221; defense attorney David Sachs said.<br />
<br />
Defense lawyer Stephen Riebling said it was odd for the judge to bring the disorder up because Spears &#8220;hasn&#8217;t been diagnosed with any mental illness.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Spears, an Alabama native, was living with her son in Chestnut Ridge, New York, when he died. She moved to Kentucky afterward and was living there when she was arrested.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Garnett Spears should be in school today and he&#8217;s not because his mother murdered him,&#8221; prosecutor Doreen Lloyd said at sentencing.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Throughout his short life, Garnett Spears was forced to suffer through repeated hospitalizations, unneeded surgical procedures and ultimately poisoning with salt, all at the hands of the one person who should have been his ultimate protector: his mother,&#8221; Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore said in a statement. &#8220;Using the child&#8217;s &#8216;illnesses&#8217; to self aggrandize herself, Lacey Spears&#8217; actions directly lead to her son&#8217;s tortured death.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Spears could be eligible for parole in 19 years, getting credit for the one year she&#8217;s already served behind bars.

			Germany’s economy minister branded Greece’s demand for €278.7 billion in reparations from the second World War as “stupid“ on Tuesday, while the German opposition said Berlin should repay a forced loan dating from the Nazi occupation.<br />
<br />
Greece’s deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas made the demand on Monday, seizing on an emotional issue in a country where many blame Germany, their biggest creditor, for the tough austerity measures and record high unemployment connected with two international bailouts totalling €240 billion.<br />
<br />
Germany’s vice chancellor and economy minister Sigmar Gabriel called the demand “stupid”, saying Greece ultimately had an interest in squeezing a bit of leeway out of its euro zone partners to help Athens overcome its debt crisis.<br />
<br />
“And this leeway has absolutely nothing to do with World War Two or reparation payments,“ said Mr Gabriel, who leads the Social Democrats (SPD), junior partner in the ruling coalition with chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party.<br />
<br />
Berlin is keen to draw a line under the reparations issue and officials have previously argued that Germany has honoured its obligations, including a 115-million deutschemark payment made to Greece in 1960.<br />
<br />
A spokeswoman for the finance ministry said on Tuesday that the government‘s position was unchanged.<br />
<br />
Eckhardt Rehberg, a budget expert for the CDU, accused Athens of deliberately mixing the debt crisis and reform requirements imposed by Greece‘s international creditors with the issue of reparations and compensation.<br />
<br />
“For me the figure of €278.7 billion of supposed war debts is neither comprehensible nor sound,” he told Reuters. “The issue of reparations has, for us, been dealt with both from a political and a legal perspective.”<br />
<br />
But Greece’s demand for Germany to repay a forced wartime loan amounting to €10.3 billion found support from the German opposition, with members of the Greens and the far-left Linke party saying Berlin should cough up.<br />
<br />
Both Manuel Sarrazin, a European policy expert for the Greens, and Annette Groth, a member of the leftist Linke party and chairman of a German-Greek parliamentary group, said that Berlin should repay a so-called occupation loan that Nazi Germany forced the Bank of Greece to make in 1942.<br />
<br />
Berlin and Athens should “jointly and amicably” take any other claims to the International Court of Justice, Mr Sarrazin said.<br />
<br />
Ms Groth went further, saying: “If you look at Greece‘s debt and the European Central Bank’s bond purchases every month, it puts the figure of €278.7 billion into perspective.”<br />
<br />
She said the German government should, at the very least, talk to Athens about how it came up with that figure.<br />
<br />
“The German government’s categorical ‘Nein’ certainly cannot be allowed to stand. That‘s disgraceful 70 years after the end of the war,” Ms Groth said.<br />
<br />
Mr Gabriel did say that Germany needed to keep asking itself whether it had done enough in connection with the second World War.<br />
<br />
He said that while the “Treaty on the Final Settlement with respect to Germany” signed in September 1990 by the then-West Germany and East Germany with the four second World War allies had put a “formal end” to the reparations debate, Germany could not – for the foreseeable future – draw a line under its responsibilities that arose from the second World War.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have a deilema on what kind of laptop to choose.  Basically, because I am in school and got a scholarship this year I'm able to get a laptop and deduct it from my taxes.  It's important to note that I'm going to school for computer programming.  (I'm actually 38 and have prior programming experience but I'm going for the official degree now).<br />
<br />
Because I'm going for programming, higher resolutions are important to me.  I use a 2600 resolution monitor for every day work and I've found it invaluable when writing code.  Trying to transition to 1300 or even 1080p is not pleasant.  However it's also for school, so portability can be important as well.  Although I don't know how often I'll take it to school since most classrooms have computers already and I take most of my non programming classes online at home.<br />
<br />
For many reasons I wont go into I've narrowed down my choices to two options, both Lenovos.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y50-uhd/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops...eries/y50-uhd/</a> (the 1399.99 model)<br />
The first one is basically a gaming laptop that fails as a gaming laptop but excels at everything else.  This one is great for obvious reasons.  Fast processor, lots of ram, good video card.  It will handle programming, multitasking, video editing ect.  The downside is that it's bigger to carry around and 2lbs heavier than the other one. but it's still only 5.29lbs and 0.9 inches thick. not unreasonably heavy or thick. (Yes, i know it's not a true 4k screen as well, but I'm ok with that.)<br />
<br />
<a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops...ies/x1-carbon/</a><br />
This one is basically a large ultraportable.  Regardless of resolution I think a 12 or 13&quot; ultraportable would be annoying to write code on or do lots of reading.  So this is a balance between the two at 14&quot;.  The problem is that the last one in the series got terrible reviews (that they claim this one fixed). And even if those items are fixed it's roughly 1/3 to 1/4 the processing power of the first one.<br />
<br />
Basically my dilemma comes down to the fact I want an ultraportable, or at least something light weight and smaller but expect I'll regret the limited processing power as I do use it for much more than just programming.<br />
<br />
I did also look at the Yoga 3 pro. and while it looks awesome it seems to be getting mixed reviews.  You're basically overpaying for average hardware.<br />
<br />
It's also important to note that I've already purchased the first one, it arrives today.  But there's just that nagging feeling I'm making the wrong decision.<br />
<br />
Anyone have an opinion?</div>

<br />
<br />
 <br />
The BioMed Central Web site. (The Washington Post) <br />
<br />
A major publisher of scholarly medical and science articles has retracted 43 papers because of “fabricated” peer reviews amid signs of a broader fake peer review racket affecting many more publications.<br />
<br />
The publisher is BioMed Central, based in the United Kingdom, which puts out 277 peer-reviewed journals. A partial list of the retracted articles suggests most of them were written by scholars at universities in China, including China Medical University, Sichuan University, Shandong University and Jiaotong University Medical School. But Jigisha Patel, associate editorial director for research integrity at BioMed Central, said it’s not “a China problem. We get a lot of robust research of China. We see this as a broader problem of how scientists are judged.”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Committee on Publication Ethics, a multidisciplinary group that includes more than 9,000 journal editors, issued a statement suggesting a much broader potential problem. The committee, it said, “has become aware of systematic, inappropriate attempts to manipulate the peer review processes of several journals across different publishers.” Those journals are now reviewing manuscripts to determine how many may need to be retracted, it said.<br />
<br />
Peer review is the vetting process designed to guarantee the integrity of scholarly articles by having experts read them and approve or disapprove them for publication. With researchers increasingly desperate for recognition, citations and professional advancement, the whole peer-review system has come under scrutiny in recent years for a host of flaws and irregularities, ranging from lackadaisical reviewing to cronyism to outright fraud.<br />
<br />
Last year, in one of the most publicized scandals, the Journal of Vibration and Control, in the field of acoustics, retracted 60 articles at one time due to what it called a “peer review and citation ring” in which the reviews, mostly from scholars in Taiwan, were submitted by people using fake names.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I don't know if this has been discussed here yet but I just finished the second book of this series and wow, is it good. It's been a while since I've picked up a book that I found this hard to put down. If you don't know, the story takes place in an intra-solar system society where travel is between planets and asteroids. No FTL and inertial physics play a big role. The whole time I was reading this I kept thinking how well it would translate to a TV series so I started looking around and low and behold, Scyfy picked it up and made a series out of it. Not only did they order it, it is finished and will be coming out sometime this year. I looked at the trailer and it looks like they did a really good job with it, like Battlestar Galactica quality on the show.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>If anyone's interested, I published a 2nd book today.  It's not part of the &quot;Trials&quot; series; its a bit of silliness that started as a joke and I followed through on it.  It's a spoof on Oz, but the story digresses...a lot.  Dawthy Pale loses her beloved dog Utoh when Elmira Goolch kills him with a hoe for digging in her garden.  Dawthy goes to Oz, the Land of the Dead, or aka The Land Down Under, to get him back, and along the way meets the Straw Golem, the Tin Maiden (tin man meets iron maiden), and a werelion, along with the Lich of the West and a Wizard....<br />
<br />
The name of it is Undead Oz, and I included illustrations this time.<br />

			     A reporter  asked Karl-Anthony Towns a question about Frank Kaminsky during  Kentucky's press conference after its Final Four loss to Wisconsin, and  Andrew Harrison appeared to mutter a snide remark under his breath.<br />
<br />
 He's frustrated, he's heartbroken, and he probably never would've said this if he thought anybody could hear him. But still. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2015/3/25/8293577/wisconsins-nigel-hayes-accidentally-reveals-his-secret-crush-to-a" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Those mics are very, very sensitive!</a><br />
   Harrison apologized on Twitter early Sunday morning and said he called Kaminsky to wish him luck in the final.<br />

			A world leader offered an Easter video message over the weekend filled with affirmations directed toward the Christian church that could come off sounding a bit strange to some — only because such words don’t seem to be stated in such overt ways on such public stages much at all these days.<br />
<br />
The central theme of this leader’s two-minute-and-25-second address was that his nation is “a Christian country.”<br />
<br />
So who offered the inspirational message?<br />
<br />
British Prime Minister David Cameron.<br />
<br />
“Easter is a time for Christians to celebrate the ultimate triumph of life over death in the resurrection of Jesus,” Cameron began. “And for all of us, it’s a time to reflect on the part that Christianity plays in our national life.”<br />
<br />
“The church is not just a collection of beautiful, old buildings; it is a living, active force doing great works right across our country,” he continued, noting how the church helps the homeless, the addicted, the suffering and the grieving.<br />
<br />
“Across Britain, Christians don’t just talk about ‘loving thy neighbor’, they live it out in faith schools, in prisons, in community groups,” Cameron noted. “And it’s for all these reasons that we should feel proud to say, ‘This is a Christian country.’ Yes, we’re a nation that embraces, welcomes and accepts all faiths and none, but we are still a Christian country.”<br />
<br />
Cameron also urged his fellow citizens to speak out about the persecution of Christians around the world.<br />
<br />

How the case against him unraveled.</a><br />

			Anthony Ray Hinton was one of Alabama’s longest-serving death row inmates, having spent more than half his life incarcerated. Now, after 30 years of saying he is innocent in the murder of two men, the 58-year-old Hinton walked out of an Alabama jail on Friday, finally a free man.<br />
<br />
“The sun does shine,” Hinton said on Friday after his release, according to AL.com<br />
<br />
Hinton’s freedom came down to the same four bullets that put him in jail to begin with.<br />
<br />
““I shouldn’t have (sat) on death row for 30 years,” he told reports according to CNN. “All they had to do was to test the gun.”<br />
<br />
“Everybody that played a part in sending me to death row, you will answer to God,” he added.<br />
<br />
He was convicted of two separate killings of restaurant workers — the Feb. 25, 1985, slaying of John Davidson, and the July 2, 1985, killing of Thomas Vason — even though there were no eyewitnesses linking Hinton to the crimes, no fingerprints linking him to the scene, and no other physical evidence except for the questionable link between a set of bullets and a gun found in Hinton’s home.<br />
<br />
For years, Hinton’s lawyers have questioned whether the bullets could be conclusively linked to the weapon. The gun belonged to Hinton’s mother, with whom he shared a home.<br />
<br />
Subsequent tests of the only physical evidence in the case raised serious doubts about whether the weapon in Hinton’s home had fired those bullets — and it even called into question whether the bullets were all fired from the same gun.<br />
<br />
The ballistic evidence combined with eyewitness testimony from someone who was present at a similar crime that Hinton was never charged with comprised the entirety of the state’s case against him.<br />
<br />
Hinton’s breakthrough came last year when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that his constitutional right to a fair trial had been violated. The high court overturned his conviction after finding that Hinton’s defense attorney at the time had hired an “expert” witness — a trained civil engineer Andrew Payne Jr. — whom the attorney viewed as “inadequate” because he didn’t think he was allowed to spend more than $1,000 to hire a more qualified one.<br />
<br />
It was easy for prosecutors to discredit Hinton’s defense expert: Payne had one eye and could hardly see through the forensic microscope, and he had limited experience evaluating ballistic evidence for trials.<br />
<br />
After the Supreme Court decision and a ruling by the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, Hinton was granted a new trial. Prosecutors scrambled to find long-lost evidence and rouse witnesses — some of whom might have died.<br />
<br />
Hinton’s lawyers with the Equal Justice Initiative asked Jefferson County Circuit Court Judge Laura Petro to dismiss the case.<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, two Alabama prosecutors – Chief Deputy Jefferson County District Attorney John Bowers and Assistant District Attorney Mike Anderton — filed a motion to drop the charges against Hinton after three experts weren’t able to link the bullets to the weapon. Petro dismissed the case and ordered Hinton freed.<br />
<br />
“There’s no closure one way or the other,” Bowers said, according to AL.com. “The experts did not say it did come from the pistol or that it didn’t come from the pistol.”<br />
<br />
“It’s never happened in all my years of prosecution,” he added.<br />
<br />
Hinton’s lawyers with EJI have long contended that their client was yet another example of a wrongfully convicted black man sentenced to death for a crime he didn’t commit. Hinton passed a polygraph test, but it was never admitted into evidence. And time and time again, despite witnesses testifying that they couldn’t link the bullets to Hinton, Alabama refused to re-consider his case.<br />
<br />
“Race, poverty, inadequate legal assistance, and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice,” Hinton’s appellate attorney at EJI Bryan Stevenson said in a statement. “I can’t think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to Anthony Ray Hinton.”
