One more comment, aren't you glad we aren't Mages?  It looks like they have the next generation Duck (http://everquest.station.sony.com/omensofwar/images/epics/EW_2.0_MAGICIAN_solo.jpg)  staff.  AFLACK!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gemdiver</div><div class="date">September 3rd, 2004, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of my biggest concerns was that they would lose the whole &quot;four&quot; concept (and all the lore that goes with it - 4 spires - 4 wizards - etc -, and I for one are glad to see they are keeping a design similar to the original.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ellocopato</div><div class="date">September 3rd, 2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wonder if the 1.5 epics will be similar as well</div></div><hr />

I think the druid one looks more like our old one...  at least in shape.</div></div><hr />
