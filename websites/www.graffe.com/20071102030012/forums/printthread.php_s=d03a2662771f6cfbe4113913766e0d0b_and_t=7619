		<div>Radcliffe isn't whiny enough to be Shinji Ikari.  Shinji is an emotionally unstable teenager who is constantly looking for support and help from other people to live his life.  In those few lucid moments that he actually has some self esteem he really shines, but otherwise he's normally whiny and sullen.<br />
<br />
Of course I found Shinji's whining to be highly annoying at times.  Maybe Daniel Radcliffe and insert some more personality into the character that was lacking in the series. :)</div>

		<div>If they use the personality of the character as a hard template for casting the actor, we're going to end up with live-action NGE starring Jake Lloyd.<br />
<br />
About the only things Daniel Radcliffe would have going for him in this part are his age and his hair, which is, of course, enough for the internet rumor hounds to sink their teeth into it. I find it extremely unlikely that Radcliffe will even be seriously considered for the part, seeing as he has a couple of big drawbacks, not the least of which being his commitment to the Harry Potter films.<br />
<br />
Any rumors circulating about casting now are almost pointless, considering all we've seen is a press release and some concept art from WETA. There isn't even a director yet, let alone serious effort towards casting.<br />
<br />
When the time comes, more than likely we will see a stable of lesser-known or first-time actors involved in this project, which is anything but bad, considering what Lord of the Rings became.</div>

I'd be really curious though as to who would play Rei, considering what her character is like and her relationship to Gendo.</div>

		<div>How about getting a Japanese kid?  <br />
<br />
I agree that Radcliffe's quiet and &quot;brooding&quot; Harry Potter is at least something like Shinji, but the idea of an English kid playing Shinji just seems odd to me.  Only slightly odder then making a live action movie of hte reatest Anime series ever that could not possibly live up to the brilliance of the Anime.</div>

Being a &quot;dubbie&quot; myself, I would have to disagree with the &quot;characters who are clearly Japanese&quot;. They're drawn to be (or at least appear) caucasian, and when you see them with their voices in the dub, they're more or less Americanized. Though, with Eva, I suppose there is a host of Japanese culture references, even in the dub.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer to see a mixed international cast myself, but for me, Shinji isn't one of the characters that would go over too well as a non-caucasian.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, the only given for this project so far is that the special effects will be worth the name of the series. WETA won't disappoint, though the rest of the film still might.</div>

		<div>Well, certainly alot of Anime characters are &quot;Americanized.&quot; Shinji though is CLEARLY Japanese, and his personalaty only makes sense in that cultural reference.  The &quot;national&quot; elements in NGE are integral to the plot (i.e., Asuke is German, the UN, spys from the Japansese Goverment, the Americans F up EVA 4, etc).  I think casting him as anything but Japane, se would really take away from the character.....</div>

When you look at Shinji by himself, you could say that, but compare him to Asuka.  When you do that, he's clearly Japanese in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Anime characters just have big eyes because when they started doing it, they were copying American cartoons, and they had big eyes, therefore, Anime characters had big eyes.  Big eyes in anime doesn't mean caucasian.<br />
<br />
Too bad Wynona Rider it too old to be considered for Rei, seems like she's werk for that.  But, I am of the mindset that live action Evangelion would suck, especially if crammed into 2 hour time frame.</div>

Too old for Rei perhaps, but not for Yui.<br />

		<div>Japanese anime adds european characteristics to their characters, but they remain idealized asians for the most part. Its similar to the fact that cosmetics and chemical peel procedures are very popular in darker skinned parts of the world, as people try to look more white.<br />
<br />
In any event, Shinji seems fairly Japanese to me.<br />
<br />
If it was up to me, I would stick to leaving it in the anime format.</div>
