		<blockquote class="restore">Sorry haven't seen the OP video, but kind of agree with Philo<br />
men are like dogs, we exert dominance, onne sorted things are more stable<br />
women are often very snappy/bitchy about it over long time.<br />
<br />
note I am NOT talking about &quot;well adjusted happy people&quot; here.<br />
<br />
Female violence has gone through the roof here. &quot;ladette&quot; culture has thrown up issues women and others perhaps didn't think about, emancipation to be stupid, violent, shag happy bastards....just like men.<br />
not so fun when you get your face ripped half off with a broken bottle, become sterile from STDs, or jailed for knifing someone<br />
<br />
i was brought up to be courteous ot women, sure as heck not hurt 'em <br />
my dad's issue was insane berserk rage that would just blow up *snaps fingers* over anything that stressed him and he'd wreck ANYTHING nearby, object or perosn (some kind of psychotic break or something I dunno, NOT like losing yer temper), but he was never ever <i>intentionally </i>cruel or hurtful...quite sad really as he's very kind person...seen ASSLOADS of wife beaters etc (fear jealousy insecurity, fear is often at root of it leadign to need to dominate), dad is...unusual<br />
<br />
back on track..so even though yer brought up to be courteous to women...holy shit sorry but sometimes you have GOT to hit 'em when they start violence, same as a guy, last damn thing you want, but omfg...woman seriously tries ot batter or knife you...tough, will try and be less brtual, but hey, I'm not gonna get hospitalized just cause a woman thinks SHE can hurt me and I *have* to take it and not fight back, f' her. Slaps are one thing, real batterings/weapons are another thing entirely.<br />
<br />
sometimes think women don't realize the true consequences of violence? having been less experienced with such?? folk don't appreciate how damn easy it is to hurt someone. <br />
So they start it and...afterwards some are shocked by the result<br />
<br />
to give example here, young woman was getting married, her aunt was drunk, arguement, and next thing you know, bride and her mother slashed ot ribbons, large chunk of the bride's face sort of fell off like a flap over her face (if get what I mean)...ye gods.<br />
<br />
what folk don' t get is LIVING with that shit afterwards, if it's done in genuine self defence, ok, it still screws you up though, but if you do not have that mental &quot;I have legitimate excuse&quot;...I don't know how folk could handle it<br />
but I've seen MANY folk over the years seriously messed up with the *mental effects of having commited unwarranted violence*<br />
one gangster I knew ended up in psycho ward cause such is NOT natural and has devestating effects on the psyche, many try to drown it out with drink<br />
<br />
anyway, empowerment of women (now seen video segment)<br />
To an <i>extent </i>I agree.<br />
it's more about, IMHO, education and stability<br />
empowered women = stability, = less children, = more time for each child's care and so on.<br />
it helps, but  women sure as hell cna be violent as men and need to freakin' grow up and accept if they wanna be like men and act like that, thn they need to do the jail time, get beaten up you name it if they are going to act like STUPID men.<br />
<br />
many men do these stupid things cause they are *screwed up*, not cause men are inherently bastards</blockquote>

</div>I remember back in high school how one dude basically stalked another dude for their last two school years.  Every time the big dude spotted the small dude anyplace a teacher wasn't around, he'd walk up and start kicking his ass.  I remember seeing the big guy one morning walk up to the little guy at the smoker's quad (we used to have a spot in high schools where kids could smoke, I shit you not) from behind and rabbit-punch the little guy in the back of the head while he was talking to someone else.  Poor little guy went down into a fetal position while the big guy kicked him in the spine and kidneys.  All of this was because the little guy had once made a single smart-assed remark.  He apologized immediately and multiple times after that.  But the big dude just wanted to kill or annihilate the little dude after that, and would seriously try to harm him until pulled off by the nearest teachers.<br />
<br />
I NEVER saw that level of either violence or lack of forgiveness in girls, not the entire time I was in school, but I saw it happen multiple times with boys.  Boys can be incredibly vicious on every possible level, whereas the girls usually just make up rumors about each other and shun each other.  I know who I'd rather have getting on my case.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Some stats and figures from my line of work and area.<br />
<br />
80 to 90% of all domestic violence is committed by men against women. When you look at repeat high risk cases, that figure rises to 95% or so.<br />
<br />
80%+ of robberies are committed by men. <br />
<br />
90% of knife crime committed by men. <br />
<br />
95% of gun crime committed by men. <br />
<br />
Murders - of the 8 homicides last year in my area, 100% committed by men. <br />
<br />
Even when you drill down to the 'lesser' violent crimes (Assault with injury etc.), you are still looking at an 75%+ rate of male suspects. <br />
<br />
Violence is predominantly a crime committed by men - and outside of DV, generally against men as well. Young men in particular make up the majority of victims and offenders for these crimes.</blockquote>

At my school (a) that level of assault would have been a police matter and (b) he'd likely have been suspended on the first occasion and expelled on the second (assuming witnesses came forward).<br />

		<blockquote class="restore">In my experience, women and men are both capable of violence. The difference, if there is on, is the level at which men and women respond with violence. I've found that while men tend to get violent faster and at a lesser level of anger if you will, it generally takes longer and more anger for a woman to respond violently. This is based on my observations while bouncing, where men would swing at the slightest  provocation while women tended to not respond violently until much angrier. At least in my experience this meant no one wanted to break up a fight between two women because it was a much more violent and vicious engagement then two drunk mooks swinging at one another. <br />

<br />
1) Guys are smarter about it and don't do their fighting at school. Although, right after school across the street is a common practice.<br />
2) Girl fights are more likely to start because of something that happened on facebook. The girls don't see each other until they come to school and then they fight about it.<br />

Either way, girls are just as likely to get in fights as guys.</blockquote>
