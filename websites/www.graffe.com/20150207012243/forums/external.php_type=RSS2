			A US senator has suggested that restaurants should not have to make their employees wash their hands after toilet visits.<br />
<br />
Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, made the comments on Monday during a speech criticising business regulations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let them decide&quot; such issues, the newly elected lawmaker said.<br />
<br />
His argument was that restaurants which did not require workers to wash their hands would quickly go out of business.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I think it's good to illustrate the point, that that's the sort of mentality we need to have to reduce the regulatory burden on this country,&quot; Mr Tillis said.<br />
<br />
He suggested that restaurants that did not require hand washing would have to alert customers with prominently displayed signs - itself a regulation.<br />
<br />
Mr Tillis stood by his comments when interviewed later at the US Capitol.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes there are regulations that maybe we want to set a direction, but then let those who are regulated decide whether or not it makes sense,&quot; Mr Tillis told the Associated Press news agency.<br />
<br />
&quot;They might pay a huge price,&quot; he said, but &quot;they get to make that decision versus government.&quot;<br />
<br />
The comments come as some Republican presidential hopefuls have questioned vaccine regulations amid a measles outbreak.<br />
<br />
At least two hopefuls have said parents are justified in sometimes having their children avoid vaccinations generally required for attending schoo
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>There is an LOL cat for this somewhere.<br />
<br />
What is with this insanity lately from the GOP in general where they pick at every minor regulation and claim we do not need them because the free market will sort it out?   Have they not seen oh lets just say the pollution in China?  that is what happens when you let the free market sort things out.</div>

<br />

		<hr />
		
			<b>TOKYO — In Japan, where conformity takes precedence over individuality, one of the most important values is to avoid “meiwaku” — causing trouble for others. And sympathy aside, the two Japanese purportedly slain by the Islamic State group are now widely viewed as troublemakers. </b><br />
<br />
So is Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Many Japanese feel that if the hostages had not ignored warnings against travel to Syria, or if Abe had not showcased Tokyo’s support for the multinational coalition against the Islamic State militants, Japan wouldn’t have been exposed to this new sense of insecurity and unwelcomed attention from Islamic extremists.<br />
<br />
“To be honest, they caused tremendous trouble to the Japanese government and to the Japanese people. In the old days, their parents would have had to commit hara-kiri (ritual suicide) to apologize,” said Taeko Sakamoto, a 64-year-old part-time worker, after first expressing sympathy over the deaths of Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa.<br />
<br />
Sakamoto also sees Abe as part of the problem, for not being more mindful of the risks at a time when he had already been pushing to expand Japan’s military role, which is limited to its own self-defense under the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution after its defeat in World War II.<br />
<br />
“I don’t want Mr. Abe to do anything else that may be seen as provocation, because that’s what would put us at a greater risk,” Sakamoto said.<br />
<br />
Japan until recently had not become directly involved in the violence surrounding Islamic State militants, who now control about a third of Syria and neighboring Iraq. Days after Abe announced during a Middle East trip last month that Japan would give $200 million in non-military aid to support the fight against Islamic State, the militants demanded a $200 million ransom for the two hostages.<br />
<br />
The hostage crisis came to a grisly end with news Sunday that Goto, a journalist, had been beheaded by the extremists. The killing of Yukawa was announced earlier.<br />
<br />
In the video posted on militant websites that purportedly shows Goto’s slaying, a man says, “Abe, because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war, this knife will not only slaughter Kenji, but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found. So let the nightmare for Japan begin.”<br />
<br />
Abe has been adamant about his commitment to fight terrorism as part of an international effort. On Thursday, Japan’s lower house, the more powerful of the two parliamentary chambers, unanimously endorsed a resolution condemning the Islamic State group’s “beyond dastardly act of terrorism” against the two Japanese nationals.<br />
<br />
In the resolution, Japan also vowed to expand humanitarian support for the Middle East and Africa, and to strengthen anti-terrorism efforts with the international community.<br />
<br />
Japan’s tensions with other countries have been largely limited to its neighbors China and South Korea. The Middle East is an unfamiliar, distant, dangerous place.<br />
<br />
“That’s where the two men dared to go and that’s probably why many people see them causing trouble,” said Koichi Nakano, international politics professor at Sophia University in Tokyo.<br />
<br />
The public’s response to the hostages was chilly from the beginning. Few seemed to sympathize with Yukawa, a 42-year-old gun aficionado and adventurer who was taken hostage in August. Media attention toward his case quickly faded and he was largely forgotten until Jan. 20, when militants made their ransom demand in a video that showed Yukawa and Goto in orange gowns and kneeling beside a masked militant.<br />
<br />
Goto’s reputation as a veteran journalist whose reports focused on children and refugees in war-torn areas won him more sympathy and small rallies by his friends and other supporters. According to his wife and others who had spoken with him, Goto had gone to Syria late last year to try to save Yukawa.<br />
<br />
Still, to address the “meiwaku” problem, both victims’ families apologized repeatedly to the government and the people for “the trouble” their sons caused, even after they died.<br />
<br />
Just two days after Abe’s office put a national flag at half-staff to mourn for the pair, a senior member of his ruling party cast Goto as a troublemaker, not a tragic hero.<br />
<br />
Masahiko Komura, vice president of the Liberal Democratic Party, said Wednesday that Goto ignored the government’s repeated warnings against his trip to Syria.<br />
<br />
“I must say that was reckless courage, not true courage, no matter how high his aspirations might have been,” Komura told reporters, reminding them not to cause trouble by following Goto’s path.<br />
<br />
Criticizing the dead in public is extremely rare in Japan, and Komura’s comment reflects how individuals are expected to act in line with the national interest.<br />
<br />
When three young Japanese were taken hostage in Iraq and later freed in 2004, they faced nationwide bashing as troublemakers. They had to cover their own medical examinations and part of their chartered flights home.<br />
<br />
Some critics accuse the government of promoting the “self-responsibility” idea as a way to shirk its own responsibility to protect Japanese citizens.<br />
<br />
“It’s a dangerous trend and we must watch,” said Taku Sakamoto, a journalist and Middle East expert.<br />
<br />
While Abe, his party’s lawmakers and other nationalists say the terrorist threat justifies Abe’s push for a tougher military posture, others say it is exactly that sort of policy that is putting Japan at greater risk of attack.<br />
<br />
“The hostage crisis is causing a tremendous impact on Japanese society, and has polarized views about which direction Japan should go in terms of national security,” said Nakano, the professor. “In a way, people saw what could happen under Abe’s security policy.”<br />
<br />
Some Japanese, like Toshihiko Ozeki, a 67-year-old pensioner, say Japan should be strong enough to defend itself, and that he supports Abe’s push to expand Japan’s defense role.<br />
<br />
“Mr. Abe has gone a bit too far, trying to make Japan look tough,” said a 55-year-old man who would provide only his family name, Arai, because he is afraid of being targeted by the Islamic militants. “We don’t want to be seen in that image, and we don’t want to have anything to do with combat.”

I don't post about humble bundles often, but think this one might be big enough that someone might want to know about it. Humble bundle is the site where you pick your own price, and get games based on the pricing tier you chose. The money can either go to the developers or a charity. Right now their bundle is on Star Wars games.<br />
<br />
For $1 you get:<br />
<br />
Knights of the Old Republic<br />
Dark Forces<br />
Jedi Knight III: Jedi Academy<br />
<br />
If you meet the average donation you get:<br />
<br />
Knights of the Old Republic 2<br />
Battlefront 2<br />
Republic Commando<br />
<br />
For $12 you get:<br />
Empire at War<br />
The Force Unleashed<br />
The Force Unleashed 2<br />
<br />
Right now the average is about $12. This is unusual. A lot of people must be going for the highest tier, I guess for The Force Unleashed.<br />
<br />
If you don't have these games it is pretty great bundle. The historical low prices for all these games combined is somewhere around 35-40 dollars. I pretty much have everything but Empire at War so it isn't that attractive to me, but someone who hasn't purchased as many games could benefit.</div>

Not that I buy the imported stuff but its not like id see this as dilution.    I do find it funny that I could buy a Cuban Cigar now but it seems Cabury from the UK is now illegal.<br />

I wonder if LBB could sidestep the ruling by moving to Canada and then selling to the shops as a Canadian operation and exploit the free trade agreements.</div>

			Techland's new PC patch for zombie survival shooter Dying Light has restricted the ability to mod the game.<br />
<br />
The patch notes for update 1.2.1 state that the fix was implemented to &quot;block cheating by changing the game's data files&quot;.<br />
<br />
But the mod files themselves have been targeted, too.<br />
<br />
Fans had managed to disable the game's always-active film grain via a small 523-byte file, which was then shared via sites such as MediaFire and TinyUpload.<br />
<br />
That file is now unavailable - it has been removed due to a anti-piracy claim by the Electronic Software Association (ESA) using the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).<br />
<br />
Reddit users discovered the DMCA ruling and quickly spread word of the find. But it is unclear whether the claim originates from developer Techland or publisher Warner Bros - or both.<br />
<br />
Previous Techland title Dead Island supported an extensive array of mods - the studio's upcoming demon hack-and-slash game Hellraid was originally born out of a Dead Island gun mod.<br />
<br />
We've contacted Techland for more information.

			Tolkien lore led a Texas boy to suspension after he brought his “one ring” to school.<br />
<br />
Kermit Elementary School officials called it a threat when the 9-year-old boy, Aiden Steward, in a playful act of make-believe, told a classmate he could make him disappear with a ring forged in fictional Middle Earth’s Mount Doom.<br />
<br />
“It sounded unbelievable,” the boy’s father, Jason Steward, told the Daily News. He insists his son “didn’t mean anything by it.”<br />
<br />
The Stewards had just watched “The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies” days earlier, inspiring Aiden’s imagination and leading him to proclaim that he had in his possession the one ring to rule them all.<br />
<br />
“Kids act out movies that they see. When I watched Superman as a kid, I went outside and tried to fly,” Steward said.<br />
<br />
Aiden claimed Thursday he could put a ring on his friend's head and make him invisible like Bilbo Baggins, who stole Gollum’s &quot;precious&quot; in J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy series “The Lord of the Rings.”<br />
<br />
<b>“I assure you my son lacks the magical powers necessary to threaten his friend’s existence,” the boy's father later wrote in an email. &quot;If he did, I'm sure he'd bring him right back.&quot;</b><br />
<br />
Principal Roxanne Greer declined to comment on the fourth-grader’s suspension, citing confidentiality policies, according to the Odessa American, who first reported Aiden’s troubles Friday.<br />
<br />
The family moved to the Kermit Independent School District only six months ago, but it’s been nothing but headaches for Aiden. He’s already been suspended three times this school year.<br />
<br />
Two of the disciplinary actions this year were in-school suspensions for referring to a classmate as black and bringing his favorite book to school: &quot;The Big Book of Knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
“He loves that book. They were studying the solar system and he took it to school. He thought his teacher would be impressed,” Steward said.<br />
<br />
But the teacher learned the popular children’s encyclopedia had a section on pregnancy, depicting a pregnant woman in an illustration, he explained.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It looks like February is going to be a good month for gaming. It isn't quite as packed as I thought it was going to be a week or two ago, but there are still a lot of games to choose from.<br />
<br />
I'm awarding the title of biggest game of the month to <b>Evolve</b>. Evolve is an asynchronous co-op/pvp game made by the people who created Left 4 Dead, in which four players play as human hunters, with different class and weapon loadouts, and one player plays as a monster that evolves into more powerful forms over the course of the match. These developers have already proven they know how to make very fun multiplayer games, and while the structure might actually hurt longevity for some people, it is nevertheless the title with the widest appeal and the most likely to generate significant hype.<br />
<br />
Next up would be the PS4 exclusive <b>The Order: 1886</b>. When this was first shown most people, including Sony supporters, were skeptical. That might actually be a bit of an understatement, as people were concerned the developers would lean too heavily on cutscenes over gameplay, but as more and more actual gameplay has been shown I've seen this opinion gradually give ground. I'm still a bit skeptical myself, but we will see soon how it stacks up.<br />
<br />
We are also getting a new Resident Evil this month in the form of <b>Resident Evil Revelations 2</b>. Now this is a bit of an interesting one, as it is going to be released in an episodic format, but unlike most games with this business model, the content is apparently already done and will simply be released weekly. This being Capcom, you would assume they are just doing this to bleed you for more money, but even the most expensive version costs $40, not $60 like you might expect. Although it does have microtransactions. They are supposedly of the non-required type for people who want to pay for shortcuts, but who knows how obnoxious they will be.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is also a good month for handhelds, the 3DS in particular. The new version of it comes out this month, erroneously named <b>&quot;the New 3DS&quot;</b> by Nintendo (I'm not even kidding). If you already have a 3DS it isn't a substantial upgrade. Bigger screen, bettery battery, better 3D tracking, faster processor (so faster load times), and a tiny substitute for a right analogue stick. The timing is set to coincide with the re-release of <b>The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</b> on 3DS, as well as <b>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</b>. <br />
<br />
I can't speak for Monster Hunter, but Majora's Mask is a very interesting game. I would recommend it to anyone who likes 3D Zelda but missed this one (arguably easy to do), or for people who like weird concepts that challenge conventional gameplay design. The concept of Majora's Mask is that you have 3 days to save the world before the moon crashes into the world, at which point the cycle starts over. Being a sorta-sequel to Ocarina of Time, you can also play songs to start the cycle over yourself. You retain progress in certain areas, so each cycle isn't done completely from scratch. The npcs of the world also have a schedule, so certain parts of that 72 hour cycle contain special events and particular times and places. The secondary mechanic of Majora's Mask is the power of equipping different masks for different effects. It gets a little weird, and I don't remember how well this part holds up.<br />
<br />
Both the Vita and the PS3, meanwhile, continues to get weird stuff out of Japan, if that's your thing. I honestly don't know anything about this month's selection, except to say I've seem light buzz for <b>htoL#NiQ: The Firefly Diaries</b> (Hotaru no Nikki) due to it's cute art style. The Wii U is getting <b>Kirby and the Rainbow Curse</b>. It's another game in the style of Canvas Curse (you draw a path for kirby to follow) that will probably be ignored. It also has a cute art style though, using a sort of claymation look.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, on PCs we have a remastered collection of the <b>Homeworld</b> games. Supposedly a new Total War is also coming out, but I've seen absolutely no one talking about it. Honestly, PC games are just as hard to keep track of as indie games lately. They don't get talked about and then suddenly they are out. Every week Steam has a stream of new games I've never even heard of being released. Apparently Fahrenheit (Indigo Prophecy) just got re-released, for example.<br />
