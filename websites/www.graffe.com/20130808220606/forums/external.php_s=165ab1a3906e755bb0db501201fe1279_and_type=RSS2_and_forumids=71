			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I hope you all enjoyed the summer doldrums, because they are most definitely over now. Finish off what you can from the Steam Sale, because the gaming floodgates are opening. I think August might actually be more packed with new releases than it normally is, as I am at a bit of a loss at how to format this. There are just so many new games that deserve attention.<br />
<br />
I'll start off with a nod to Danenel, who has been working tirelessly on <b>Disney's Infinity</b>. It sort of looks like an extension of what they did with Toy Story 3's toybox mode (which I believe he also worked on) combined with the ability to expand on your content using physical toys that has made Skylanders so popular (do you ever get sick of that comparison? :D).<br />
<br />
After that the game with probably the most mainstream appeal this month is going to be <b>Saints Row IV</b>. This series is fully divorced from being a copy of GTA by this point, and while it will probably be another divisive game, the people who like it seem to really like it. If you want to play something that is batshit crazy and &quot;steals&quot; all the best ideas from every other popular game or movie in existence, play that game. <br />
<br />
The biggest game for this particular crowd will be <b>The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</b>. We already have several threads about it in fact! They saw the success of the strategy game and turned a sort of tepid fps into what many of us wanted the first Mass Effect to be: a deep and engaging squad based third person shooter. Fair warning though: I'm hearing that while they nailed what makes XCOM, XCOM, that the development was so long and troubled that the final product is lacking in polish in a few areas. Graphics and cutscenes are apparently underwhelming for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for a couple of more niche titles I think people should know about<b></b>:<br />
<br />
<b>Killer is Dead</b> is the next Suda 51 game and is a bit of a spiritual successor to Killer 7. For those that don't know, Suda 51 is the pseudonym of a Japanese developer known for wacky but interesting gameplay ideas but kind of cumbersome and awkward gameplay. His past games include Lollipop Chainsaw and No More Heroes. This new game is getting decent hype, and will be suitably absurd from what I've seen. <br />
<br />
<b>Dragon's Crown</b> is a new side-scrolling brawler from Vanillaware, usually known for beautiful graphics and sort of shallow action rpg gameplay (Odin Sphere, Muramasa). This is another divisive game thanks to it's art direction. I will admit I hate it myself, but I think I hate the way people are acting even more. The art director basically said generic fantasy would be boring, so let's make it ridiculous and people will talk about it, and so they did. Anyway, the game itself is getting good reviews and seems to be the culmination of everything that was ever good about classic 90's brawlers like Golden Axe and such.<br />
<br />
Edit: I can't believe I forgot, <b>Tales of Xillia</b> also comes out this month for the PS3. &quot;Tales of&quot; games are jrpgs featuring action combat and competently executed tropes from the jrpg genre. They seldom hit the heights of more popular titles, but they usually avoid the lows as well. I'm hearing the combat in this one isn't as good as Graces f from a couple years ago, but that the story and characters are better. The sequel has already been confirmed for localizatoin, I believe for next year.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Wii U finally gets its first Nintendo developed &quot;killer app&quot; in the form of <b>Pikmin 3</b>. Much later than they promised but I'm hearing good things. Handhelds in general have a pretty lackluster month, but Nintendo also has a new <b>Mario and Luigi </b>rpg for the 3DS.<br />
<br />
While it is coming out on other systems, I think the biggest game for PCs this month is arguably <b>Payday 2.</b> The original Payday was sort of a proof of concept: get three of your friends together and play a heist movie together. It's an amazingly good idea that didn't come together perfectly well. I'm playing it now, and it's quite fun but also quite obviously an experiment that didn't quite come together. The sequel purportedly fixes all that, and unless it is being overhyped sounds like what the first game was trying to be.<br />
<br />
PCs are also getting a few ports of older games, including <b>Lords of Shadow</b>, and is one of the many platforms the <b>DuckTales</b> remake is coming out on.<br />
<br />
To see the full list, including things I didn't mention, click on the spoiler tag below. And as always, if I overlooked something that you think people might find interesting, let us know! I see something called<b> Europa Universalis IV </b>for PC in release lists, but have no idea what it is. I never never heard anyone talk about it on any site I go to.<br />
<br />
I will also apologize for not having a clue how much of this is coming out in Europe this month. It's harder when there are this many titles to keep track of. This only occurred to me because I haven't seen any indication as to whether or not you are getting Xillia. It does look like Europe is finally getting Etrian Odyssey 4 for the 3DS though.<br />

			It&#8217;s finally happened. Activision-Blizzard has bought out the  majority of its shares from Vivendi, leaving Bobby Kotick as the CEO of a  basement-dwelling bedroom-coding indie studio. Will <a href="http://www.callofduty.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Call Of Duty: Sepia Ops</a>  claim next year&#8217;s IGF Grand Prize? Can the next WarCraft&#8217;s block-based  image change see it taking on the might of independent mega-hit <a href="https://minecraft.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Minecraft</a>?  Will Spryro return as a pixellated retro-dragon, starring in a  side-scrolling puzzle-platformer about pacifism, divorce and the decline  of the LP in an age of easily consumable digital music? Yes, yes, yes.<br />
<br />
  Nathan points out that this news may make it acceptable for people to  admit how much they love Skylanders. I don&#8217;t know a great deal about  that, but I do know about all the numbers involved in the deal because I  am good at reading press releases.<br />
 The company itself has spent around $5.83 billion to reclaim 429  million shares that were held by Vivendi following the 2008 merger  between the companies. Kotick will stay on as president and CEO, and  along with chairman Brian Kelly, he led a separate purchase of 172  million shares for $2.34 billion. A lot of money has changed hands &#8211; or  accounts, I guess, since I doubt they actually handed it over in a large  stack. Imagine if they had though &#8211; a picture of Kotick sliding two and  a half billion dollars across a table toward some men in suits. The  internet would generate enough of its accursed memes to keep reddit  afloat for six hundred years.<br />
 <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/23640708-f59e-11e2-94e9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2a90tVh6c" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Financial Times</a>  points out that &#8220;the agreement came soon after Vivendi gained new  powers to force Activision to take on debt and pay out a sizeable  dividend&#8221;. Sounds like a good reason to cut the cord.<br />
 At some point after completing the transaction, Kotick morphed into a  PowerPoint presentation and projected these words into the sky:<br />
 &#8220;We should emerge even stronger, an independent company with a  best-in-class franchise portfolio, and the focus and flexibility to  drive long-term shareholder value and expand our leadership position as  one of the world&#8217;s most important entertainment companies.&#8221;<br />
 There was also mention of &#8220;attractive financing markets&#8221;, at which  point everybody in the room made their excuses and headed straight for  the coldest of corporate showers.

</div>I am sure they raised most of that money from outside investors.  it will hopefully shake up those studios and force them to be better quicker developers.</div>

<br />
Hmm guess I'll buy it. One of my biggest problems with Civ 5 has been the way the end game always comes down to a few civs using the conquer and tech victory method every time. Sounds like they fixed it &quot;Gameplay updates help balance different play styles&quot; so the various civs play to their strengths and perhaps go for diplo victories or cultural victories; and more than 3 civs are alive in the end, so d/l'ing now.</div>
