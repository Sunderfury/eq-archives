I prefer a thin crust, floppy like the New York style and cooked enough to get the cheese golden brown.  -Not a fan of the thick, under-cooked pan (Chicago style) pizza.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit of a fanatic, and with the frequent traveling I do, its common for me to browse reviews at Yelp and Trip Advisor, etc. to find decent local places.<br />
<br />
There's clearly a divide in pizza tastes across this country judging from the comments.  Many crack me up.<br />
<br />
When I see comments like, &quot;Ewww it was so greasy I had to mop it up with a napkin first,&quot; I just shake my head.  You're doing it wrong lol.  Saying a pizza is too greasy is like saying the grass is too green!  :p<br />
<br />
Pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and peppers are among my favorite toppings.  -Jalopeno's when I'm feeling courageous.<br />
<br />
Another thing I've noticed is the lack of banana peppers as a topping in some parts of the country.  They're a staple in Ohio where I'm from and most of the Midwest that I've seen, but I'm always surprised to see them unavailable in other locations around the country.<br />
<br />
What sayeth you?</div>
