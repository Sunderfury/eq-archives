			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have what I think are a mix of difficult through god level difficulty searches/research recon challenges.<br />
<br />
a) I remember reading some time ago, maybe a year or two ago, that modern hosiery/silk socks sucks and get runners etc. easily, which wearing women's knee highs (come up below the calf for me more or less as a man with big feet compared to most women [1]) I can confirm regardless of brand as being true. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, it is claimed that in the 1970s that such hosiery for whatever reason was effectively indestructible and was extremely resistant towards developing runners and essentially never happened on its own, some effort such as being caught on a corner had to happen for them to tear.<br />
<br />
Mission: find out what the difference between modern textiles/sewing stich used results in this change. Phrased another way, determine what 1970s hosiery was made out with respect to material used and also what stich technique was commonly used for those.<br />
<br />
These two reddit threads may provide inspiration for whatever invocation you discover: <br />
<br />
i) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2oqz8r/what_brands_of_pantyhose_have_you_found_to_keep/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashi...found_to_keep/</a><br />
<br />
ii) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sewing/comments/1qgngk/im_looking_for_interesting_weaves_of_nylon_such/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/sewing/comm...of_nylon_such/</a><br />
<br />
Bonus Mission: locate some vendor who still makes hosiery that way, ideally for socks. Etsy and similar vendor sites are acceptable. <br />
<br />
b) find some combination of search terms and special operators to locate the c-- home page WITHOUT using c minus minus instead. Google does not index the token &quot;--&quot; so it interpets that search as a search for the C programming language. Restrictions: you cannot use c minus minus and you cannot restrict the search to a web page that you know only refers to c minus minus utilizing the site: or in: or inurl: operators or some equivalent I am unaware of.<br />
<br />
c) find a search engine which does not try and be clever about interpeting search terms by automagically also searching for similar words at the same time or automagically correcting my search term if it is spelled incorrectly according to the automagical algorithm the search engine uses. It is acceptable if there is simply some way to tell the search engine to not do this rather than the search engine always not being clever.<br />
<br />
d) Find a search engine which has reverse video search capabilities and still exists rather than being vaporware or dissolved. This may not exist.<br />
<br />
d) Find a search engine which is competent at subimage searching rather than just searching for the full image. The search enginne should realize that subsection of the image refers also to the full image rather than being something unrelated or unique itself. This may not exist.<br />
<br />
e) Find some Internet archival software that is open source and anyone can contribute to with respect to being themselves a crawler for that page. I am looking for something that is equivalent to archive.org that is resilient to nation state actors and cease and desist orders. This may not exist.<br />
<br />
f) Find a wikipedia like site that as a rule, does not delete articles ever no matter the dubious notoriety of those pages or merit in existing.<br />
<br />
g) Find a place on the net which documents clothing history such that it also acts as a database for all clothing to have been made available to the public. Something like a magazine archive but for all clothes.<br />
<br />
h) It is my observation as a life long pervert that inexplicably Japanese porn stars have much better breast implants than US or UK porn stars. Why? <br />
<br />
[1] Yes I wear women's hosiery as they are thinner when wearing dress shoes. Come at me bro. Also women's thigh highs are perfectly sized when worn with boxer briefs, I don't have any overlap in materials compared to when I am wearing long johns, so it is a better outcome/design.</div>

			BEIJING — China is exploring a new way to grapple with its mounting pile of bad corporate debt, though its top central banker sought on Saturday to dispel worries that the plan would simply shift the burden to other parts of the country’s vast economy.<br />
<br />
Under the tentative proposal, Chinese officials would allow banks saddled with growing quantities of bad loans to sell that debt to investors, said Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China. The goal is to help alleviate one of the major drags on China’s economy, the world’s second largest after the United States’ and a major driver of global growth.<br />
<br />
But Mr. Zhou and a deputy central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, said they would take steps to make sure the effort did not create the kind of risk-laden financial products that played a major role in the 2008 global financial crisis. The effort would be modest, regulators would monitor it closely, and mom-and-pop investors would be kept out, they said.<br />
<br />
“There’s no need to exaggerate,” Mr. Zhou said at a news conference held as part of China’s annual legislative session in Beijing. “There’s not certainty that this would be a very big market.”<br />
<br />
China’s corporate debt has ballooned in recent years during a broader lending-and-spending binge, led by the Chinese government in an attempt to keep the country’s economy humming. China’s total debt now stands at about 2.5 years’ economic output, a level that has raised worries among economists. Much of that is corporate debt, prompting many economists to warn that those loans pose a threat to China’s economic health.<br />
<br />
That lending spree has also led to a major surplus of Chinese steel factories, glassworks and other industrial facilities, dragging down China’s economic performance to its slowest rate in 25 years and casting a pall over the broader global outlook.<br />
<br />
On paper, China’s banks have some of the world’s lowest loan default rates. But economists inside and outside the country say many banks — in a practice known as “extend and pretend” — do not force companies to pay up or restructure, putting off the problem. That raises concerns that China’s big banks could have considerable amounts of bad loans on their books.<br />
<br />
The program sketched by the officials on Saturday followed reports in recent days that as the economy slows, some Chinese companies failing to pay back loans would be given reprieves because the banks would be allowed to convert that debt into shares of those companies. But the central bank officials did not directly address that proposal. On Thursday, a heavily indebted Chinese shipbuilding company revealed that it would issue equity to creditors instead of repaying $2.17 billion of outstanding loans.<br />
<br />
Some experts are skeptical that such a program would resolve the problem. “Using shares to pay overdue loans could help banks temporarily shore up their balance sheets, but it could cause greater difficulties down the road,” said Ning Zhu, a finance professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance.<br />
 <br />
Mr. Zhou indicated that under the proposal described on Saturday, the bad debt would be sold to institutional investors rather than being held by the banks. China already allows this practice — known as securitization — so banks and other financial institutions can sell off existing loans, freeing up capital for new business. But the central bankers’ latest comments suggested that the practice was being refined to focus on nonperforming loans.<br />
<br />
“Banks are positive about securitization,” Mr. Zhou said. “If some assets can be packaged and sold off, they can adjust their balance sheets.” He said that because the loans sold off would be troubled, they would fetch prices below their face value.<br />
<br />
Mr. Zhou and Mr. Pan stressed that the program would be modest at first and absorb lessons from the 2008 financial crisis. China’s new debt products would be kept simple, Mr. Pan said.<br />
<br />
“This is just a pilot,” Mr. Pan said. “We’ve selected a small number of major financial institutions with quite high management standards to develop trials, and the credit involved in the initial trials is not large.”<br />
<br />
Shang Fulin, the head of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said at a separate news conference on Saturday that the trial effort to sell off bad debt was needed to ensure that more bank loans flowed into supporting the real economy, rather than turning over old loans.<br />
<br />
“Our total volume of loans is quite adequate, but the speed of turnover of loans has been falling year after year,” Mr. Shang said.

			People squawking on their phones on public transportation is annoying as hell. That’s why one Chicago man allegedly took it upon himself to jam fellow commuters’ cell phone signals as part of a morning ritual that lasted months. Now he’s a charged felon in jail, being held for a $10,000 bail.<br />
<br />
Dennis Nicholl, 63, is accused of jamming mobile phone signals aboard the Red Line train in Chicago—a habit that one fellow Red Line commuter claims has been happening since 2014. It’s because people talking on trains annoy Nicholl, his lawyer says.<br />
<br />
Nicholl had allegedly operated an object that the Chicago Sun-Times describes as “an object that had five antennas” and that was “shipped from overseas.” Nicholls knew the gizmo was illegal. Police say passengers had been complaining about cell phone service on the train for months (Nicholl takes the Red Line to work everyday), and that one concerned passenger had even dialed 911. That’s when the cops got involved. <br />
<br />
Cops started working with the Chicago Transit Authority and the Federal Communications Commission, the Chicago Tribune reports, working off a tip they received months ago, as well as a submitted photo of Nicholl holding the black electronic jammer.<br />
<br />
After setting up plainclothes surveillance on the train, an undercover officer on Tuesday recognized Nicholl from his photo and sat near him. The cop used a personal cell phone to try to make a call, and it was immediately dropped. That’s when Nicholl was arrested.<br />
<br />
Today, Nicholl appeared in court, where the judge called him “the cell phone police.” He is being charged with a felony: one count of “count of unlawful interference with a public utility,” the Sun-Times reports.<br />
<br />
Apparently, Nicholl pulled a similar stunt back in 2009, but was only charged for a misdemeanor that time, and that jammer was confiscated and destroyed. People are debating whether he’s a hero or a villain. I’d be pissed if my phone ever got jammed—but hey, if something keeps other people from chattering obnoxiously or texting-and-walking, I guess I wouldn’t complain.

			In 2011, [China] ran a $276.5 billion trade surplus with the United States. This “accomplishment” stems largely from the fact that China is practicing economic mercantilism on an unprecedented scale. China seeks not merely competitive advantage, but absolute advantage. In other words, China’s strategy is to win in virtually all industries, especially advanced technology products and services. One may argue that all countries do this and assert it is the essence of competition. But China’s policies represent a departure from traditional competition and international trade norms. Autarky, not trade, defines China’s goal. As such China’s economic strategy consists of two main objectives: 1) develop and support all industries that can expand exports, especially higher value-added ones, and reduce imports; 2) and do this in a way that ensures that Chinese-owned firms win. It is time for policymakers in the United States and other countries to begin responding to today’s reality for <b>Chinese mercantilism represents a fundamental threat to not only the U.S. economy, but to the entire system of market and rules-based globalization.</b>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The whole idea behind globalization is that maybe your country loses some specific manufacturing jobs.  But the world economy as a whole grows, you adapt and find new jobs and in the end everyone is better off.<br />
<br />
Sure, capitalists are able to profit from arbitrage opportunities presented by vastly different labor markets by winning the race to sell out their employees the fastest.  Mark Zuckerberg desperately wants to get in on this exploitation gravy train and sell out his rank&amp;file software engineers for H1B temps.  But ultimately, the effects of this kind of cruel greed are fairly limited and once traitorous sellouts take their cut, the economy will eventually benefit by greater overall growth.  All those offshore laborers stealing jobs will be new markets for new products, etc.<br />
<br />
But countries don't always play by the rules (even the US).  China is playing particularly unfairly.  The paper reviews a whole list of Chinese practices designed to give China absolute supremacy in the world economy by ensuring their labor is always cheaper than anyone else's and that the balance of trade always favors them dramatically.<br />

			The theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer reduce revenues going to innovators, making it more difficult for them to reinvest in R&amp;D. The manipulation of standards and other import restrictions balkanizes global markets, keeping them smaller than they otherwise would be, thereby raising global production costs. Further integration of global supply chains that link the United States and China could be good for both nations but not if Chinese policies continue to be based on absolute advantage and mercantilism. In this case, the results will be more of the same: the loss of U.S. industrial and high-tech output, and the jobs and GDP growth that go with it.

			China’s goal of absolute advantage through innovation mercantilism runs counter to the effective functioning of the global trading system, which is grounded in the notion of <b>competitive advantage: nations finding what they are good at or can be good at and exporting products and services in these areas to pay for the imports of goods and services they are not as good at producing.  Running an integrated global trading system that maximizes global economic welfare is impossible when the second-largest economy rejects the fundamental premise.</b>

			In contrast to American economic policy, Chinese economic policy is not about maximizing short-term consumer welfare through free markets. Rather it is about maximizing long-term producer welfare and achieving autarky. And it’s a particular kind of producer welfare where the owner of the factors of production is the Chinese Communist Party. As such, the focus on producer welfare is tied not just to a particular theory of economic growth but to direct self-interest of the Chinese government and officials in it.<br />
<br />
To maximize producer welfare, China has put in place an array of mercantilist policies whose principal focus is on helping the home economy in an unfair manner at the expense of the global economy. <b>For Chinese mercantilists, it is not enough to compete to make a better product. Instead, they seek destroy the competition and make the only product.</b>

			While virtually all governments have crafted economic development policies to boost competitive advantage, China has developed the most comprehensive set of policies, with most of them violating the spirit, if not the letter of the law of the WTO. The second is their focus on Chinese firms, rather than Chinese establishments (e.g., Chinese factories and offices owned by Chinese or foreign firms). Most governments provide incentives to any establishment within their borders, regardless of its nationality. For Chinese leaders, at least since after 2006, Chinese firms are the key. Chinese mercantilist policies champion Chinese firms in two ways: the first is through policies designed to unfairly spur exports and reduce imports that help Chinese firms but also foreign firms in China. These policies include currency manipulation, relative high tariffs (three times higher than U.S. tariffs); and tax incentives for exports. The second is through policies designed to help Chinese firms while discriminating against foreign establishments in China. These policies take numerous forms including discriminatory government procurement; controls on foreign purchases designed to force technology transfer to China; land grants and rent subsidies to Chinese-owned firms; preferential loans from banks; tax incentives for Chinese-owned firms; cash subsidies; benefits to state-owned enterprises; generous export financing; government-sanctioned monopolies; a weak and discriminatory patent system; joint-venture requirements; forced technology transfer; intellectual property theft; cyber-espionage to steal intellectual property (IP); domestic technology standards; direct discrimination against foreign firms; limits on imports and sales by foreign firms; onerous regulatory certification requirements; and limiting exports of critical materials in order to deny foreign firms key inputs.

			This report analyzes the logic and factual basis for each of these justifications and asserts that none of them withstand close scrutiny.

			On one side are the analysts who look at China’s heavy-handed statist practices, its lack of respect for intellectual property, and its massive subsidies of particular technologies and argue that there is no way for this model to be successful, and therefore America does not need to worry. In fact, it is increasingly in vogue to argue that “China is about to fail.” The advice? Just be patient. No need to do anything. Proponents of this view believe as an article of faith that the Washington Consensus is the only real playbook for economic prosperity. Any nation misguided enough to follow an alternative model, especially one as distorted as the Beijing consensus, must by definition fail. Moreover, if the Chinese government is misguided enough to subsidize its exports, American consumers are the better off for it.<br />
But this school of thought ignores the fact that the Beijing consensus model has shown success; an economy growing at more than 10 percent per year for a decade is not failure. And even if China’s policies will mean its economic stagnation in the long term, they certainly inflict lasting damage to the U.S. and other countries, both in the short term and the long term.  Moreover, the standard for judging the threat from Chinese mercantilism is not whether China will succeed in dominating the industries America is good at, but rather whether Chinese mercantilist policies per se will harm the U.S. economy. On that basis, there should be no doubt.

			“Protectionists” are right in that it is important to ramp up the pressure on China to get it to start playing by the rules. But the notion that America can’t be competitive against China, even if the latter plays by the rules, is wrong, as is the notion that global integration with China can’t be in America’s and the world’s interests. America doesn’t need to close its borders to be a vibrant competitor. It must, however, require that other nations, especially large ones, like China, play by the rules.

</div>And speaking of playing by the rules, that means not encouraging your citizens to border jump into the the neighboring country and then sending remittances back home -- <a href="http://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/remittances-totaled-oil-income/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remittances sent home by Mexicans working outside the country surpassed petroleum revenues in 2015 for the first time.</a><br />

			The most important question for the United States is what its overall strategic goal should be vis-à-vis strategic trade engagement with China. To date, that engagement has largely been what can be described as “whack a mole.” The United States expends resources to identify, respond to, and combat particular instances of Chinese mercantilism. Even if it wins such battles, all too often the damage has already been done. <b>The whack-a-mole strategy ultimately will be unsuccessful going forward because the Chinese government has shown that it can erect new mercantilist policies faster than the United States can get it to remove old ones. As a result, a new strategy needs to be grounded in a results-oriented trade regime. America and the broader community of free-trading nations, should hold China to specific goals. One is the significant reduction of its global trade surplus. China also needs to be held accountable for specific, quantifiable commitments to reduce levels of intellectual property piracy, use of global rather than domestic technology standards, and abandoning requirements for joint ventures and forced tech transfer, among other steps toward fair trade.</b>

</div>The paper is really long... at this point it starts going into more details.  Here's one last snippet about IP:<br />

<div class="bbcode_container">

	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			China, like many developing nations, frequently asserts that intellectual property controls are a form of Western imperialism designed to keep them poor. One Chinese official complained that they have to pay too much for foreign intellectual property and that this is a legitimate reason for the move to dramatically increase the number of created-in-China technologies. As Dan Breznitz states, Chinese officials and corporate leaders “agree that Chinese companies should not have to pay for the right to use a technology that every economic actor is required to use.”203 But this misses three points. First, China has almost $3 trillion in foreign exchange earnings from chronic trade surpluses that it could use to purchase foreign IP. Because of its stage of development, China’s economy specializes in cost-based production. Because of their stage of development, Europe, Japan and the United States specialize in innovation and IP-based production. By refusing to pay for IP, the Chinese are refusing to cede competitive advantage in anything. Second, if China doesn’t want to import IP, what does it want to buy from developed nations? After all, Western nations like the United States have invested trillions of dollars to develop IP. (The answer of course, is that they want to buy very little).

The Republicans are trying to one-up each other in being divisive and making racist, sexist, xenophobic remarks, but the Democrats have been having a real debate about the issues. I'm glad that our Democratic candidates are both out there talking about who will do more to hold the big banks accountable and level the playing field for America's working families. I haven't said yet who I'm supporting because I think that debate is important and at this point don't want to tip the scales.

			A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/opinion/sunday/the-return-of-the-diy-abortion.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">piece recently published in the New York Times</a> has charted a direct relationship between limiting abortion clinic access and self-induced abortions. It looks like the latter has seen a significant increase since 2011, when 24 states legislated 92 provisions with an aim to obstruct access to abortion-related services.<br />
<br />
While the article says it is difficult to collect survey data due to the stigmas attached to the subject (“people may not feel comfortable sharing the truth in a survey”), data derived from Google searches gave a concise picture of “the hidden demand for self-induced abortion” that bears a striking similarity to a pre-Roe v. Wade America:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			 “In 2015, in the United States, there were about 119,000 searchers for the exact phrase ‘how to have a miscarriage.’ There were also searchers for other variants—’how to self abort’—and for particular methods. Over all, there were more than 700,000 Google searches looking into self-induced abortions in 2015.<br />
<br />
For comparison, there were some 3.4 million searches for abortion clinics and, according to estimates by the Guttmacher Institute, there are around one million legal abortions a year.”
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>To recap: the number of people who looked up D.I.Y. abortions on the Internet is almost as many as the number of people who actually had abortions.<br />
<br />
The piece also breaks down other search terms involving methodology, including “tens of thousands of searches looking into abortion by herbs like parsley or vitamin C,” roughly 4,000 searches for play-by-play instructions for hanger abortions, and a few hundred for “bleaching one’s uterus and punching one’s stomach.”<br />
<br />
So where are these self-induced abortions taking place? There seems to be a correlation between states with the more restrictions in place to curb abortion clinic access—the highest number of Google searches were found in Mississippi, which has only one abortion clinic to its name, and “eight of the 10 states with highest search rates for self-induced abortions are considered...to be hostile or very hostile to abortion.”<br />
<br />
Even more devastating were results garnered from another survey in Texas, which revealed that 4.1% of women in the state either knew or were almost sure that their best friend had attempted a D.I.Y. abortion. Yet another study recorded that 34% of Americans, “either [women or] the potential father”—did not tell anyone else about their or their partner’s abortion. The stats illustrate a bleak vista of an unforgiving culture of shame and self-blame—a result of restricted access to services they need.<br />
<br />
In the end, the article found a definitive cause-and-effect: Limiting access to abortion clinics: it doesn’t stave off the rate of abortions in the U.S., but only increases the number of illegal abortions year to year.

		<hr />
		
			Turkey's biggest newspaper, Zaman, has published an edition carrying pro-government articles, two days after being taken over by authorities.<br />
<br />
On Friday, a court ruled that Zaman, previously linked to an opponent of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, should now be run by administrators.<br />
<br />
Its last edition under old ownership on Saturday said Turkey's press had seen one of its &quot;darkest days&quot;.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a newspaper set up by former Zaman staff was launched on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Police raided Zaman's Istanbul offices late on Friday hours after a court ruling placed it under state control, but managers were still able to get Saturday's edition to print.<br />
<br />
No reason was given by the court for the decision.<br />
<br />
Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the takeover was &quot;legal, not political&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is out of the question for either me or any of my colleagues to interfere in this process,&quot; he said in a television interview.<br />
<br />
Water cannon and tear gas were used against some 500 Zaman supporters gathered in front of its headquarters on Saturday.<br />
<br />
Zaman journalists who arrived to work on Saturday said their access to internal servers had been denied. Its editor-in-chief Abdulhamit Bilici and a leading columnist were also fired.<br />
<br />
The front page of Sunday's edition of Zaman, the first under new ownership, bears an image of Mr Erdogan and the headline &quot;Historic excitement about the bridge&quot;. The articles says Mr Erdogan is to lay the last part of a third bridge across the Bosphorus that is close to completion.<br />
<br />
One report in Turkey last year said the bridge may bear Mr Erdogan's name.<br />
<br />
The edition was met with scepticism by journalists who used to write for Zaman, which has a readership of 650,000.<br />
<br />
Some former Zaman staff produced a new newspaper named Yarina Bakis, or Look to Tomorrow, on Sunday.<br />
<br />
Its front page showed an image of tear gas being fired outside Zaman's headquarters on Saturday, with the headline: &quot;Water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets are not enough: Throw him out!&quot;<br />
<br />
The newspaper said &quot;Throw him out&quot; was uttered by a policeman who ordered a journalist at the protest to be removed.<br />
<br />
It is unclear how the new newspaper was published at short notice, and where it was printed.<br />
<br />
The Twitter feed that used to belong to Zaman now redirects automatically to that of Yarina Bakis.<br />
<br />
Zaman's website is now inaccessible, but has a holding message promising there will soon be &quot;unbiased coverage for our readers&quot;.<br />
<br />
The paper was closely linked to the Hizmet movement of influential US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, which Turkey says is a &quot;terrorist&quot; group aiming to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government.<br />
<br />
Mr Gulen was once an ally of Mr Erdogan but the two fell out. Many Hizmet supporters have been arrested.<br />
<br />
BBC Turkish correspondent Rengin Arslan, in Istanbul, said some online commentators were attacking supporters of Mr Gulen and Zaman for ignoring instances in which voices critical of his party had themselves been punished.<br />
<br />
The European Union's response has been to issue weak statements of concern, the BBC's Mark Lowen says.<br />
<br />
It is accused of acting softly on Turkey as it needs the country's support in managing the refugee crisis.<br />
<br />
The government in Ankara has come under increasing international criticism over its treatment of journalists.<br />
<br />
The EU's diplomatic service said that Turkey &quot;needs to respect and promote high democratic standards and practices, including freedom of the media&quot;, while the US described the move as &quot;troubling&quot;.

			<b>Early this morning, TMZ reported that a buried knife had been recovered from the O.J. Simpson estate by a construction worker at some point between 1998, when the house was demolished, and “several years ago.” The construction worker turned it over to an LAPD officer who was on the street, who turned out to be working private security for a movie shoot, and kept the knife for himself. </b><br />
<br />
In incredible timing for the renewed media attention on the O.J. Simpson murder trial via both Ryan Murphy’s new show and a forthcoming ESPN documentary, this twice-buried knife was brought to light only very recently: by TMZ’s account, the cop retired, then contacted a friend in the LAPD’s Robbery Homicide Division, asking for the case number for the Simpson/Goldman murder, so he could engrave it on the frame he was purchasing for this O.J. knife.<br />
<br />
By 10 a.m., the LAPD had confirmed the story to NBC4, and at 12:30 p.m., they held a press conference. Andrew Neiman, a police captain in the media relations division, gave a few more details: most notably, that they will not be releasing the name of the officer who had the knife in his possession, who reportedly believed that the O.J. case was closed. (As no conviction had been secured, it technically remained, and remains, open.)<br />
<br />
“As I explained at the beginning,” Neiman said, “any case that we don’t have a conviction on all of the charges or we’re not able to prove to our satisfaction that we’ve proved the facts of the case, remains an open case.”<br />
<br />
He also specified that he “shouldn’t be calling it the O.J. Simpson case. This is the Nicole Brown case. This is a double homicide that is still open and ongoing.” Investigators in Robbery Homicide are treating it “as we would all evidence, so it has been submitted to our lab. They are going to study and examine it for all forensics, including serology and DNA and hair samples, and that is ongoing as we speak.”<br />
<br />
The first question he took was from a reporter who asked about his reaction, upon hearing that an LAPD officer had withheld evidence in what “many would call the biggest murder trial in L.A. history.” Neiman said, “I was really surprised. I would think that an LAPD officer—if this story is accurate, as we’re being told—would know that any time you come in contact with evidence, that you should and shall submit that to investigators. I don’t know why that didn’t happen, or if that’s entirely accurate, or if this whole story is bogus from the get-go.”<br />
<br />
When asked about whether or not the officer could be called up for obstruction of justice, Neiman said, “I don’t know that. We will look into potentiality of any criminal charges that may be involved here.”<br />
<br />
Neiman also specified that the cop retired in the late ‘90s, not more recently, as TMZ’s story implied. “It was brought to our attention that this retired officer had an item that was believed to or alleged to be possibly taken or recovered from the Rockingham estate back in the ’90s. Once we learned about that, we followed up.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know how the contact was made,” he added.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Immersive virtual reality headsets have been something people have been trying to make for decades now, and in the span of the next month consumer versions will finally be available. It's always been kind of a pipe dream, but improvements in technology have finally created headsets with a high enough resolution, frame rate, and low enough input lag to make a decent experience. While the barrier to entry is kind of high, I thought it might be fun to have a thread laying down the options in case anyone does decide to become an early adopter and try it. There's no rush, however, as this stuff is probably the future in the same way smartphones were the future once.<br />
<br />
The two major players are Oculus Rift, owned by Facebook, and the HTC Vive, in cooperation with Valve. They have similar capabilities with slight changes in the execution. The Oculus Rift launches on March 29th, while the Vive launches April 5th. The Rift launches at $600, while the Vive launches at $800. This is somewhat offset by the fact that the Vive is launching with it's special motion controllers, while the Rift comes with an Xbox One controller and the motion controllers not becoming available until later in the year. These special controllers are what enable hand tracking within a game while still giving a high level of control over the experience.<br />
<br />
System requirements are similar for both. You need an Nvidia GTX 970/Radeon R9 290 gpu, an Intel i5-4590 or better cpu, and 4-8 gigs of RAM. The Rift seems to require more USB ports, while the Vive requires a large room, as it uses lasers for motion tracking. I'm unsure if the Rift has anything like this, but the Vive also apparently syncs with your smart phone, and has a front facing camera, both designed to reduce the amount of isolation you get from putting on a VR headset.<br />
<br />
I'm unsure of the full extent of games and app support for the various platforms but the Rift launches with Lucky's Tale and Eve Valkyrie, while the Vive launches with Fantastic Contraption and Job Simulator.<br />
<br />
<br />
The third player is Sony with their Playstation VR, which won't launch until later this year. The technologies seem similar, and will run off of a PS4 instead of a PC, but details like price haven't been worked out yet.<br />
<br />
If you want VR on the cheap, you have a couple other options (which have actually been available for awhile). Google Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR. Both utilize your phone (Gear VR requiring a Samsung Galaxy), and both can be had for less than $100. As the equipment is less sophisticated and not built specifically for VR, the experience is not ideal, but it's a cheap way to try VR without the high cost.<br />

<br />
Now, I haven't actually been following this stuff that closely myself, but last year most of the games seemed more like tech demos and I was dubious as to what kind of support these systems would have at launch. A little googling has surprised me with how much is going to be available. These links include commentary and Youtube clips. As I haven't watched them all myself, I may post a few if any look particularly interesting later. I also encourage everyone else to post anything that looks interesting to them (Ackar posted a neat card game/rts in <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?78509-The-Conduit-developer-is-making-a-CCG-for-Oculus-Rift" target="_blank">Other Games</a> last week, for example).<br />

<br />
<br />
And finally, the only thing more fun than trying VR is watching someone else try VR. Simultaneously, the one thing that pushes support for new technology forward faster than video games is porn. So I leave you with a hilarious and NSFW (for subject matter and language, the video itself is censored) video of people reacting to trying VR porn for the first time. Not to derail the thread with that stuff already, but man it's funny. Be warned that this may lead you down a rabbit hole that is more scary than funny, but still funny.<br />
