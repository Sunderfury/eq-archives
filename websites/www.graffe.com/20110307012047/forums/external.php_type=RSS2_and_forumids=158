			Update - 12:33PM PST: Very soon happens to be Today! Players can have their first look at the premiere update for Rift today (Saturday 3/5/11) starting @ 2:00PM PST!<br />
<br />
We’re already hard at work on Rift’s first major update and soon we will need your help! We will be temporarily opening the Alpha test shard for all players with an active subscription very soon, here you will be able to have a firsthand look at all the new content and improvements we have in the wings.<br />
<br />
Alpha will only be open during certain periods so be sure to check it out and give your feedback when you can! Of course, being a test shard means that at times things will not go as planned – expect bugs, bumps, and frequent maintenance.<br />
<br />
While you can’t copy your characters, those who played on Alpha before headstart will find their characters are still available. Lastly, try to avoid sharing spoilers across the forums; many players enjoy learning and discovering the game on their own, we appreciate your understanding.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help and feedback, we’re making Rift better together – have fun!<br />
<br />
Start patching today –<a href="http://update2.triongames.com/patcher/public/alpha/rift-alpha.exe" target="_blank"> Download the Alpha Client</a><br />
<br />
If you still have your client installed from pre-headstart Alpha testing, don't re-download the game. Simply launch Alpha and patch up!<br />
<br />
You’ll find the latest notes in the patcher!

<div>Straight up - I love Rift. It's the best MMO to be released since WoW, and it's occupying way too much of my timer. But it's not perfect, and there are just a few simple things that could be changed to improve it.<br />
<br />
i) Stop any level mob knock you off your mount. It's incredibly infuriating and nonsense that my level 30 character will still get trampled on as he tries to cross Freemarch. It's just not fun being dismounted all the time by grey mobs. <br />
<br />
ii) Get rid of the stacking debuff from fleeing a fight / trying to run past a mob. This is a DREADFUL idea, and means I have to kill grey mobs for no purpose when dismounted. I honestly have no idea why this is in the game, other than to slow you down and piss you off. <br />
<br />
iii) Add in more graveyards. There just aren't enough - in any zone I've been in. Corpse runs are not fun once they take over a minute. I understand there may be a n issue with graveyward zerging a rift boss, but to be frank - that's happening anyway. Don't penalise everyone for it. <br />
<br />
iv) Add in more transportation. The zones need multiple portculum hubs between the outposts. Even Freemarch is cursed by having the planar goods saleperson in Kings Retreat and the bulk of the zone a mile to the south. (The Guardian starting zone has a portculum in it for exactly this reason - not sure why King's retreat doesn't have the same quest and gateway). Right now, the lack of transportation means that invasions often go wrong because no-one can reach the mobs in time, and it prevents players from getting too fights and content. (It's also a real pain doing your crafting dailies if your current adventuring area isn't near the portculum for that zone). <br />
<br />
v) Give players much more control over their buff &amp; debuff bars. As a rogue, I have 4 60 second buffs I need to keep running, plus a 20 second protection buff whilst tanking and a 30 second shield buff. There is no way for me to spot these other than manually track them in my buff bar - which is nigh on impossible given all the buffs we have. If you have a bard in your group, it's just flat out nightmare-ish. We need to be able to set it so we only see our own buffs in the buff bar, we need to be able to set it so short duration buffs (1 minute or less) can go elsewhere on the screen. <br />
<br />
And just for me - please fix the teleporting under the world bug as a Riftstalker. Its the best rogue class any MMO has ever introduced with that talent spec, and I love every minute playing it, but it's unbelievably annoying and frustrtaing to have to run back from the graveyard every so often because you were fighting on a slope, or the moon is half gibeous or whatever causes it.</div>

<div>Just found an empty wardstone.  I used my wardstone ability.... poof the wardstone comes to life and a guy runs in saying.. we need to make this a base... he puts up a little tent.... lo and behold he has a daily quest.  I do the daily and come back... he give me a planar shard thingy (nice blue level shard) and then builds a fancy tent and puts up two flags at the wardstone.  <br />
<br />
Now the base is permanent.  (Well unless it gets overrun by a rift spawn or taken out in pvp).<br />
<br />
How fucking cool IS this game?!!!<br />

<div>I have a few questions if anyone doesn't mind answering.<br />
<br />
How are the system requirements?  I have an Athlon 64 x2 4600+, GeForce 8600 GTS, and 4gb of ram.  I've read that the minimum requirements are extremely low, like a dual core 2ghz and an old GeForce FX 5900, but in my experience minimum reqs are never actually playable.  I don't have to be able to run the game with everything turned up to the max, but I don't want it all turned all the way down either.  I need to be able to play with enough textures that you can make out facial features, a playable rendering distance, and reasonably little machine lag.  So any of you playing with an older rig have any insight on how the game might play for me?<br />
<br />
How much group content is there?<br />
<br />
How is the group content for leveling?  For an example of what I mean, in Everquest 2, xp in group dungeons was excellent pre-kunark.  I especially loved the Kingdom of Sky expansion because it had big long quest lines that took place almost entirely in group dungeons.  Leveling from 60-70 in KoS in eq2 was probably the most fun progressing I've had in an MMO.  By contrast I hated that with Kunark, it seemed all heroic content gave very minimal xp as compared to solo quests.  I have much less experience with WoW, but it 'felt' to be this way as well.  Very solo quest oriented when it came to leveling.  This was also my experience with Aion, Warhammer Online, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I've been avoiding new games for a while because I won't be able to upgrade my PC anytime soon, but with the seemingly low system reqs for Rift, I might give it a try.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading.<br />

<br />
The Iron Tombs are the best newbie dungeon I have ever done.  Perfectly balanced and cool event/bosses.  Wonderful atmosphere.  Tanking is a bit rough for me so far as I am still playing with my spec and have not had too many chances to tank in the past few years. <br />
<br />
Rift events, particularly in a good guild, are a total blast.  I love working with some random people to free a town from an invasion base.  It's just cool that the world changes and you have to unchange it.  <br />
<br />
This is a great game.</div>

<div>Hey there.<br />
<br />
I found this excellent tutorial for setting up ACT with a Rift plugin:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forums.riftgame.com/showthread.php?45549-Advanced-Combat-Tracker-(DPS-Meter-Spell-Timer-etc.)-with-Rift.-ReadItIWorkedHard." target="_blank">Setup post - long</a>.<br />
<br />
For those of you that haven't dabbled in EQ2, ACT is a combat log parser on steroids. You can set up various triggers, see your damage in neat charts, configure timers etc. etc.<br />
It does a LOT of things - but mostly it provides a handy DPS overlay meter and parsing tool.<br />
<br />
I am by no means a proponent of &quot;the meter&quot; - I'm the raid leader who screams at the meter-focused numbnuts to move out of the fire.<br />
It is, however, a good way of analyzing your own performance and whatnot - figure out what your miss percentages are and so forth.<br />
<br />
It is also pretty handy for tracking some buffs and cooldowns - Riftstalkers, for example, have three defensive buffs that absolutely need to be up 24/7. <br />
One of them (Phantom Blow) is pretty easy to loose track of in combat since the in-game visual is pretty small, and you don't want 6% damage reduction to drop off - ever :D<br />
You can set up an ACT timer to track it - it only does static-sized buff tracking, so buffs with variable length are a no-go.<br />
Edit: It doesn't actually track buffs - it just starts the timer whenever it sees something predefined come up in the combat logs.  <br />
<br />
There is no EULA breakage - ACT is a stand-alone program that every EQ2 raid guild uses to parse combat logs. ALL it does is read the combatlog.txt in your Rift directory - NOTHING else.<br />
As one guy put it - you can even run it with the game turned off, and it'd work :)</div>
