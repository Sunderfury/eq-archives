				The Orwell Prize is delighted to announce that, to mark the 70th anniversary of the diaries, each diary entry will be published on this blog exactly seventy years after it was written, allowing you to follow Orwell’s recuperation in Morocco, his return to the UK, and his opinions on the descent of Europe into war in real time. The diaries end in 1942, three years into the conflict.

</div>This strikes me as a really interesting idea -- Posthumous blogging from a great writer and observer of humanity.  Why wouldn't a daily dose of Orwell's observations be just as compelling and interesting as less noteworthy modern-day bloggers?<br />

Will he allow comments?  If so, how will he deal with trolls?</div>

<br />
I also notice there is a new direction with how things are being shown to us. There must be a new director. Fights are different, animations for each character's specialty are better. It's all very much a better series now. They are trying new things and it's very exciting to watch. At the center - there are interesting issues in Bleach, and usually you gotta dig for em. <br />
<br />
New episode will be out today. just saw 181. Nice to see Soifon in action again: She's grown on me like a fungus since the first arc. I think I like her - I used to hate her guts.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the fact this arc is completely non-canonical means that they never intended to fill any of the captain's seats. Soul society IS a Hobbesian nightmare.</div>

&quot;A Whole Lotta Ugly&quot; in Church Shooting<br />
<br />
The pastor of the now too-well-known Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church occasionally wrote columns for the local newspaper, the Knoxville News-Sentinel. Last March, he wrote one entitled &quot;Tolerance,&quot; in which he compared past intolerance of interracial couples to today's intolerance of gay couples.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the movie 'Hairspray,'&quot; Rev. Chris Buice wrote, &quot;the character Mabelle warns a newly formed interracial couple, 'You two better brace yourselves for a whole lotta ugly comin' at you from a never-ending parade of stupid.' We forget that it was not that long ago that the law forbade such relationships, even while some prominent segregationist politicians engaged in them. Today, a gay couple might encounter harassment and derision for simply holding hands in a public park.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>Sunday morning, a whole lotta ugly entered the church's sanctuary in the form of a man who was angry about &quot;the liberal movement&quot; and its tolerance for gay couples, among other things. The man started firing a shotgun he bought from a pawnshop. <u>He killed two people and injured seven others before he was wrestled to the floor and later arrested and charged with first-degree murder.</u></b><br />
<br />
So now we can add liberals to the list of enemy combatants in America's culture war.<br />
<br />
According to the News-Sentinel, Knoxville police department investigator Steve Still wrote in the search warrant that <b>Jim David Adkisson, the man who was arrested in the rampage, went to the church &quot;because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country, and that he felt that the Democrats had tied his country's hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in America with the aid of major media outlets.&quot;</b><br />
<br />
<b>Adkisson, who had served in the military, said &quot;that because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement he would then target those that had voted them in office,&quot; the search warrant states. Among the items seized from Adkisson's house were three books: &quot;<u>The O'Reilly Factor</u>,&quot; by television commentator Bill O'Reilly; &quot;Liberalism is a Mental Disorder,&quot; by radio personality <u>Michael Savage; and &quot;Let Freedom Ring,&quot; by political pundit Sean Hannity.</u></b><br />
<br />
The Unitarian Universalist Association might be the most liberal denomination in the country. Most members consider themselves part of a post-Christian religion that draws wisdom from all religions and philosophies. There is no central creed, but the denomination promotes a set of principles that includes a belief in &quot;the inherent worth and dignity of every person.&quot;<br />
<br />
David Gushee and Rachel Laser used a similar phrase earlier this month when they called on Barack Obama and John McCain &quot;to bring a just end&quot; to the culture wars.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gay and lesbian issues, like abortion, have also been tearing the nation apart,&quot; Gushee, an evangelical and professor at Mercer University, and Laser, a program director for the progressive think tank called Third Way, wrote in a guest column for On Faith.<br />
<br />
&quot;But on these issues too we can find a shared common value and shared path forward. That shared value is human dignity. We can all agree that all human beings are created in Godâ€™s image and have and deserve an innate human dignity - even those with whom one differs or disagrees. We can all agree that honoring this human dignity is a high moral and religious calling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Senators McCain and Obama,&quot; they concluded, &quot;each of you has great potential to model a new type of leadership. Each of you has the power to heal the country and carve a new path forward through our shared common values. We humbly submit our joint prayer that you, Senators McCain and Obama, help bring a just end to the culture wars.&quot;<br />
<br />
That would help, but it's not their job to end the culture war. We all started it. We're all responsible for what we say, write and do that increases hostility towards liberals or conservatives or any group of people whose beliefs differ from ours.<br />
<br />
Obviously, there was a lot more going on inside the Knoxville shooter's head, heart and soul than hatred of liberals. Police said his ex-wife once was a member of that church, that he was having trouble finding a job, and that his food stamps had been cut.<br />
<br />
Angry, hateful and deranged people kill Amish school girls and Virginia college students and shoppers at a Nebraska mall. They kill Christians, Jews and Muslims, atheists and humanists, conservative and liberals, Republicans and Democrats, unitarians and trinitarians.<br />
<br />
But there's a whole lotta ugly out there, coming at us from a never-ending parade of stupid. It doesn't need any encouragement.

				Nintendo has just announced that it and 54 game software companies are filing a lawsuit with the Tokyo District Court against companies that import &quot;R4 Revolution for DS&quot;-type devices, using the Unfair Competition Prevention Law as the legal grounding. Nintendo is asking for the cease of marketing, sales and importation of these Chinese-made devices. The R4 allows easy software piracy by fitting right into the DS's cartridge slot. Data is stored on a Micro SD and downloaded from websites via a flash drive, and the R4 has a small slot that the Micro SD card goes into. In a statement released today, Nintendo announced that these R4 devices &quot;allow illegal uploading from the internet&quot;, adding that &quot;it is causing severe damage to our company and software makers, and this is something that we cannot possibly overlook.&quot; In conclusion, Nintendo adds that such devices hurts the growth of the entire game industry and steps must be taken regarding the legality of R4 carts. It's important to note that this legal injunction is for Japan only.<br />
<br />
Back in November 2007, Nintendo announced that it was &quot;keeping a close eye on the products and studying them.&quot; Earlier this spring, Nintendo apparently pressured Akihabara retailers to stop carrying the popular R4 carts.<br />

				Drugs swoops 'have little impact'  <br />
 <br />
Drug dealers are &quot;extremely resilient&quot;, the report says <br />
Police are fighting a losing battle against drugs crime, with seizures having little impact on reducing supply or demand, research has suggested. <br />
<br />
The UK Drug Policy Commission said despite the large sums of money spent tackling the problem, traditional police tactics were not working. <br />
<br />
It said the £5.3bn British drugs market was too &quot;fluid&quot; for law enforcement agencies to cut supply. <br />
<br />
It added more should be done to reduce the effects of drugs on communities. <br />
<br />
A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;The government agrees that enforcement in isolation is not effective.&quot; <br />
<br />
BBC home editor Mark Easton said the report was a &quot;very bleak assessment of where we are in what some people call the war on drugs&quot;. <br />
<br />
The report, titled Tackling Drug Networks and Distribution Networks in the UK, concluded that although the amount of Class A drugs seized between 1996 and 2005 doubled, the market had proved to be &quot;extremely resilient&quot;. <br />
<br />
This was despite 12% of the heroin and 9% of the cocaine in Britain being impounded during the same period, and despite the convictions of dealers and traffickers. <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
The independent think-tank said dealers were able to adapt quickly to interruptions in supply, for instance by reducing purity, enabling them to maintain their profit margins. <br />
<br />
The report estimated that between 60% and 80% of drugs would need to be seized to put major traffickers out of business - yet crackdowns on such a scale have never been achieved in the UK. <br />
<br />
  It is very difficult to show that increasing drug seizures actually leads to less drug-related harm <br />
<br />
David Blakey <br />
UK Drug Policy Commission<br />
<br />
<br />
More women used as drug mules<br />
Send us your comments<br />
Differing views on drugs world <br />
It went so far as to warn that police crackdowns could have a negative effect on the problem. <br />
<br />
They could threaten public safety and health by &quot;altering the drug users' behaviour and potentially… setting up violent drug gang conflicts as police move dealers from one area to another&quot;, said our correspondent. <br />
<br />
Instead, the study's authors suggested the government concentrated on the &quot;collateral damage&quot; of the trade - sex markets, gangs, human trafficking, corruption, drug-related crime and anti-social behaviour. <br />
<br />
They added that resources should be focused on disrupting &quot;street-level markets&quot; and tackling violence and intimidation in communities. <br />
<br />
The criminal justice costs of class A drugs alone are estimated at £4bn a year. <br />
<br />
Tim McSweeney, one of the report's authors, said: &quot;We were struck by just how little evidence there is to show that the hundreds of millions of pounds spent on UK enforcement each year has made a sustainable impact.&quot; <br />
<br />
Former police chief constable David Blakey, of the UK Drug Policy Commission, said enforcement agencies tended to be judged by the amount they had managed to capture.  FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME <br />
<br />
<br />
More from Today programme <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a pity as it is very difficult to show that increasing drug seizures actually leads to less drug-related harm,&quot; he added. <br />
<br />
But he later said asking whether the money spent on enforcement was wasted was &quot;more of a moot question&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is against the law and the law needs to be enforced so whether or not we are actually driving drugs down and making drugs disappear - which I think would be asking too much of any country - there is an element of law enforcement which should and must continue,&quot; he told the BBC. <br />
<br />
Brian Paddick, a former deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme part of the problem was the performance targets set for police forces. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is no incentive at the moment for chief constables to tackle drug crime. All the performance indicators against which police forces are measured are based on reduction of acquisitive crime.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Home Office said seizures were only part of the government's approach, with intervention programmes getting 1,000 offenders into drug treatment each week. <br />
<br />
&quot;Many of the report's recommendations are already being implemented,&quot; the spokesperson added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our drugs strategy encompasses enforcement, prevention, education and treatment.&quot;

McCain backs off his no-new-tax pledge <br />
New comments cause criticism from anti-tax groups<br />
The Associated Press<br />
updated 9:17 p.m. CT, Tues., July. 29, 2008<br />
WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate  John McCain's signal that he may be open to a higher payroll tax for Social Security, despite previous vows not to raise taxes of any kind, is drawing sharp rebukes from conservatives. <br />
<br />
McCain's shift has come in stages, catching some Republicans by surprise. Speaking with reporters on his campaign bus on July 9, he cited a need to shore up Social Security. &quot;I cannot tell you what I would do, except to put everything on the table,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
He went a step farther Sunday on ABC's &quot;This Week,&quot; in response to a question about payroll tax increases. <br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing that's off the table. I have my positions, and I'll articulate them. But nothing's off the table,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I don't want tax increases. But that doesn't mean that anything is off the table.&quot; <br />
<br />
That comment drew a strong response from the Club for Growth, a Washington anti-tax group. McCain's comments, the group said in a letter to the Arizona senator, are &quot;shocking because you have been adamant in your opposition to raising taxes under any circumstances.&quot; <br />
<br />
During a town-hall meeting in Sparks, Nev., McCain insisted anew Tuesday that he would not raise taxes if elected. <br />
<br />
He frequently has promised not to raise taxes. <br />
<br />
At a July 7 town-hall meeting in Denver, he said voters faced a stark choice between him and Democrat Barack Obama. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sen. Obama will raise your taxes,&quot; McCain said. &quot;I won't.&quot; <br />
<br />
In a March 16 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, McCain said he would cut taxes where possible, and not raise them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mean none?&quot; Hannity asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;None,&quot; McCain replied. <br />
<br />
<br />
Both candidates have said Social Security's funding formula needs to be changed to ensure the program's long-term viability. Obama has called for imposing a new payroll tax on incomes above $250,000. Currently, only incomes up to $102,000 are subject to the 12.4 percent payroll tax, which employers and employees split evenly. <br />
<br />
When Obama announced his plan June 13, McCain's top economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, told reporters that as president McCain would not consider a payroll tax increase &quot;under any imaginable circumstance.&quot; <br />
<br />
McCain has made no specific proposals for Social Security, refusing to rule in or out anything to strengthen the benefit program for retirees and the disabled. Both candidates have said that, if elected, they would try to work out details with Republican and Democratic lawmakers. <br />
<br />
Asked for an explanation of McCain's latest comments, campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds said the Arizona senator &quot;has a clear and demonstrated record of opposing tax increases. John McCain is going to cut taxes&quot; and improve government discipline, he said. <br />
<br />
Promises never to raise taxes have bedeviled past Republican officeholders. Before being elected president in 1988, George H.W. Bush said, &quot;Read my lips, no new taxes.&quot; But facing severe budget problems, he reneged on the promise. Some conservative groups never forgave him. <br />

<br />
Is it likely that they'll pony up the 50 mil to continue the war ??<br />
<br />
Should I consider temporarily retiring my Caldari toon and starting, say, an Amarr or Minmatar, far from the griefer's ops area ?<br />

Suggestions and advice most welcome.  My current corp is now effectively paralyzed. . . (and I've moved operations: they found us where we were holed up in Autaris. . .)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Alright, go ahead and get all the &quot;Wipe it and install XP&quot; comments out of your system. I'll wait.<br />
<br />
Done? Awesome.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm trying to lower Vista's memory footprint, since it seems to be a bottleneck on what is otherwise a more powerful machine then my desktop is. Does anyone know of a confirmed list of services (similar to the ones available for XP) that can be safely disabled/set to manual, in order to lower the resources the OS uses? I'd appreciate any help I can get, since I don't want to willy-nilly disable services.<br />
<br />
And for the &quot;Wipe it and install XP&quot; crowd, I'm waiting to get some income so I can get a new version of XP =P Although if I can get Vista running on a diet, I may just keep it to poke at DX10 compatible games.</div>
