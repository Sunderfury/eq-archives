</div>This guy, this guy gets it.  <br />
<br />
I've been burned too many times not to have learned my lesson.  <br />
<br />
All backups all the time with as much redundancy as reasonable has been engrained into my psyche.<br />
<br />
Arq (<a href="http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.haystacksoftware.com/arq/</a>) is my favorite backup software implementation thus far.  <br />
<br />
Only downside is that it is OS X only, so I can't use it on any of my other systems.  <br />
<br />
It's very well done though.  <br />
<br />
Arq complements time machine exceptionally.<br />
<br />
Tarsnap (<a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.tarsnap.com/</a>) is an excellent multi-platform option, however it seems like it will be super expensive and it is a one man shop so very exposed to falling apart if the guy running it dies, seems super nice though (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5767116" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5767116</a>) and a super nerd.<br />
<br />
I don't use thumb drives anymore as I've been burned too many times when I've lost them, usually whilst on a death march and not paying all that much attention.  <br />
<br />
I use Amazon's Cloud Drive ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000796931" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.htm...cId=1000796931</a> ) for moving small files around instead.  <br />
<br />
I was using Dropbox, but they always have some tragic fuck up periodically so I have no confidence in them.  <br />
<br />
Then I tried using Google Drive after that, but I try to avoid Google's products anymore aside from their Open Source software and e-mail.  <br />
<br />
The lack of quality support and fragile state it was in when I last tried it turned me off from the project.  <br />
<br />
Amazon's Cloud Drive has been nice, there isn't a Linux or BSD client though, but since I only use Linux in a VM and have no use for it in the context of BSD that is okay.<br />
<br />
I have all of my most important project related files backed up to github and use git for them as I do all of my projects and papers in Emacs w/ git or a Jetbrains product w/ git.<br />
<br />
I realize now I don't have my servers backed up in any way....  <br />
<br />
That would make for a shitty recovery.</blockquote>

</div>Did you start out being genius with backups or were you scarred terribly like myself before smartening up about backups? Are you backing up in a significantly different geography so that natural disasters impact is mitigated? It would suck to lose all of that stuff if your town got hammered by a natural disaster unfortunately.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Scared and recognition that I was being stupid.<br />
<br />
So I used to have a single external hard drive that I copied files to.  That was my backup.  Once upon a time, long ago in college - a dumbass roomate put a boot sector virus on my pc (by booting off an infected floppy), and it hammered all my files, and that found it's way to my backups.  Then about ten years later - I was looking through some of my wedding pictures and I noticed a separate incident had corrupted a couple of the files.  Since I was copying over the files, my backups had corrupted versions as well.<br />
<br />
It was at that point I realized I needed to smarten up if I really cared about my digital files.  I'd say I took baby steps over the years, eventually arriving where I am now.  I'm sure it'll continue to evolve.  First it was a raid array with incremental backups, but then I got worried about things like a fire, or a lightning strike, etc.  So the alternating backups sneaker net to work started happening.<br />
<br />
The only thing I'm not covered from is a complete and total disaster that wipes out a whole town.  I'm ok with that risk for the moment.  I believe eventually, I'll get a new NAS (I'd like the 5 bay model TBH - or I'll build a freenas machine), and if I do - I'll most certainly set my old synology NAS up at my father in law's house, and replicate the photos and videos over the net to that machine 3000 miles away.<br />
<br />
My latest fear is hard drive reliability.  I'm using green drives in the NAS for the low power consumption - but I wish now I was using raid ready red drives.  I'm worried about the large data read/writes, and a raid array rebuild failing due to a read error.  I think I'm good with my external backups - but I'm kicking myself for not buying the reliable drives.  Live and learn.<br />
<br />
I think it all comes down to people evaluating what their digital files are worth to them - and many people fail to contemplate how upset they'd be if they lost them.  I'm willing to put forth a little time and money to make sure I'm covered in the event of a failure  /shrug</blockquote>

</div>It doesn't matter really, outside of using an external cloud service, and even then only if you value privacy a lot.  Of course, if you have sensitive data on it like from work or personal finance infos that changes things.  I use encryption mainly so that if someone steals my gear I can have peace of mind still.  I'm not too concerned about the SWAT jacking my porn too much.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I have been trying out an Airport Time Capsule for the past week or so.  It is /okay/, however I am not a big fan of it if you can manage your own router + nas readily.  The router portion of the time capsule is especially poor as it offers little in the way of configuration.  The only good thing I have to say about it really is that it has 802.11ac instead of just 802.11n.  I would much rather get that in a less restrictive router though. If you absolutely must have an Airport Time Capsule, use it in bridge mode and have a more configurable router elsewhere.  It is one of the worser Apple devices I've tried out. If you have no idea what you are doing when it comes to networking or you are especially disinterested in spending any time dicking around with such it may be for you, otherwise I would avoid it even if you are pretty integrated with Apple's ecosystem (like me).</blockquote>
