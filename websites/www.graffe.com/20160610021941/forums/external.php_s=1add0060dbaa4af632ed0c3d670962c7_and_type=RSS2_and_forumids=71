			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>June is a bit of a dull month for releases, especially compared to last month. There was actually a fair bit of faff that I wasn't sure if I should even list in the spoiler tag, let alone mention in this post itself. Console ports of PC indie games, for example. If I overlooked something that people might want to hear about, let us know!<br />
<br />
The biggest game this month is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOe3ik_RViE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Mirror's Edge: Catalyst</b></a>, or at least it is the game with the most potential. The first game was an experiment in non-traditional game design: a first person runner/platformer that emphasized movement and avoiding conflict, rather than shooting your way out of situations. It was a hard sell, and performed poorly as a result. Years of being a cult classic that few people actually enjoyed seems to have encouraged EA to try again. As practically the only AAA game this month, it will be interesting to see if it does any better this time.<br />
<br />
Aside from that there isn't too much, though this is a decent month if you you like Japanese rpgs. We've got two fairly big ones this month (though not the biggest). First up, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG0U77AA0X4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness</b></a>. I sort of find the art style to be incredibly garish, but these games tend to have pretty interesting combat systems. Here's hoping the everything else isn't as obnoxious this time.<br />
<br />
The Wii U is also getting a fairly major release with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpVhoHMcRD8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Toyko Mirage Sessions #FE</b></a>. This is actually the Fire Emblem X Shin Megami Tensei (the world Persona is derived from) crossover. Potential fans were originally disappointed when the crossover ended up being some weird pop idol rpg, with the Fire Emblem characters essentially being Persona summons for the main characters. The game has also been deemed too niche to be worth an English dub, yet Nintendo is going through the trouble of changing other things about the localization, inciting nerd outrage across the internet (par for the course with Nintendo localizations). Regardless, it is being made by Atlus and should be good if you don't die from embarrassment while playing it.<br />
<br />
Rounding up the Japanese role-playing games this month are a port/remake of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h7_RuKZ-Y8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Odin Sphere</b></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqzYVolKua8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Atelier Sophie</b></a>, the next entry in a long line of rpgs that focus on crafting as much as combat.<br />
<br />
Handhelds get a couple of interesting releases this month. The 3DS gets <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg5H6p3Mfo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Kirby: Planet Robobot</b></a>, and both the 3DS and the Vita get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etz9m5RApxo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Zero Time Dilemma</b></a>, the final entry in the Zero Escape (9 Persons 9 Hours 9 Doors, Virtue's Last Reward) series. I've mentioned these before. They are mystery/puzzle adventure games. A number of people are kidnapped, put in a dungeon, and have to solve puzzles to escape, while trying to figure out who the killer is. These games usually force the player into uncomfortable moral dilemmas. Do you condemn someone to save yourself, or risk letting them do the same to you?<br />
<br />
This particular entry in the series has left behind it's visual novel roots, and instead has voiced cutscenes, in an attempt to reach a larger audience, though I wonder if they have the budget to do it effectively. Each game also has a different hook, and this one is trying to duplicate television mystery shows. You choose a scene with no context as to when it takes place in the story (the characters themselves don't know either). As you play through the game and solve the mysteries, you gradually put together the timeline of events. This particular entry in the series is also being released on PC but I've seen no mention of ports of the older games. While each game is relatively stand alone, there is a thread that connects the games together, especially in this one judging by the cast.<br />
<br />
Finally, if you aren't interested in any of these Japanese games, the PC is getting a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGTMxjL1ED0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Hearts of Iron</b></a> grand strategy game, a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0IJqIzO_YM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lego Star Wars (Force Awakens)</b></a> is out on everything, and a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egw4K8to9d0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Sherlock Holmes</b></a> mystery adventure game is coming out on PC/PS4/X1. I played the previous in this series and it was fairly decent.<br />

Anyone else playing this?  It's pre-release but my kid fell in love with it after playing the 1 hour free trial, so I bought it (with Xbox cash that was earned with points, so no biggie).  It's pretty interesting and feels like it could have MineCraftian potential with some work and polish.</div>

How can a game that celebrates the greatest characters across all Blizzard properties have three dwarves and not one gnome? It cant, so Heroes of the Storm now has a gnome, though technically shes a dragon. Its complicated.<br />
<br />
Chromie is now available in Blizzards MOBA, bringing the measured adorability of the gnome race to the Nexus, along with the time-bending powers of one of World of Warcrafts most powerful bronze dragons. Chromie is actually Chronormu, the female bronzie dedicated to maintaining timelines and historical events. Shes a more sociable sort than most dragons, so she picked a form everyone can love.<br />
<br />
Everyone.<br />
<br />
Chromie is all about time blasts and sands of time and other time-related things. Time, time, time. <br />
<br />
The latest ranged assassin in Heroes of the Storm, Chromie might not technically be a gnome, but that doesnt lessen the race. That an all-powerful dragon would choose such a form just goes to prove how amazing gnomes are. <br />
<br />
Yes, well go with that.

			 Its been nearly six years since there was a new, proper Civilization game. Thats changing later this year, with the newly announced Civilization VI.<br />
<br />
Heres the official trailer for the game, due to arrive on October 21 on PC:<br />
<br />

<iframe class="restrain" title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qvBf6WBatk0?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<br />
In the new game, cities now physically expand on the map, units can be combined into a single tile, and there are new multiplayer modes designed for players to finish a game in a single session. (That last one is smart!)<br />
<br />
It seems like Civilization VI will make a big emphasis on expanding diplomacy , with the developers promising changes that play out over the course of the game, from primitive first interactions where conflict is a fact of life, to late game alliances and negotiations.<br />
<br />
If youve never played a Civilization game beforelike, say, meyou might be daunted by the series, but Firaxis Games is promising Civilization VI will include a new slate of tutorials designed to ramp in new players. That said, they also made a point that veterans will have ample opportunity to tweak the game to their liking, hopefully removing any worries its being nerfed.<br />
<br />
Theres also a digital deluxe edition that offers a discount on four DLC packs that will add new maps, scenarios, civilizations and leaders.
