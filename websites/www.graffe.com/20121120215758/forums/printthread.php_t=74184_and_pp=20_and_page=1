			<b>THE US military has designated Julian Assange and WikiLeaks as enemies of the United States - the same legal category as the al-Qaeda terrorist network and the Taliban insurgency.</b><br />
<br />
Declassified US Air Force counter-intelligence documents, released under US freedom-of-information laws, reveal that military personnel who contact WikiLeaks or WikiLeaks supporters may be at risk of being charged with &quot;communicating with the enemy&quot;, a military crime that carries a maximum sentence of death.<br />
<br />
The documents, some originally classified &quot;Secret/NoForn&quot; - not releasable to non-US nationals - record a probe by the air force's Office of Special Investigations into a cyber systems analyst based in Britain who allegedly expressed support for WikiLeaks and attended pro-Assange demonstrations in London.<br />
<br />
The counter-intelligence investigation focused on whether the analyst, who had a top-secret security clearance and access to the US military's Secret Internet Protocol Router network, had disclosed classified or sensitive information to WikiLeaks supporters, described as an &quot;anti-US and/or anti-military group&quot;.<br />
<br />
The suspected offence was &quot;communicating with the enemy, 104-D&quot;, an article in the US Uniform Code of Military Justice that prohibits military personnel from &quot;communicating, corresponding or holding intercourse with the enemy&quot;.<br />
<br />
The analyst's access to classified information was suspended. However, the investigators closed the case without laying charges. The analyst denied leaking information.<br />
<br />
Mr Assange remains holed up in Ecuador's embassy in London. He was granted diplomatic asylum on the grounds that if extradited to Sweden to be questioned about sexual assault allegations, he would be at risk of extradition to the US to face espionage or conspiracy charges arising from the leaking of hundreds of thousands of secret US military and diplomatic reports.<br />
<br />
<b>US Vice-President Joe Biden labelled Mr Assange a &quot;high-tech terrorist&quot; in December 2010 and US congressional leaders have called for him to be charged with espionage.</b><br />
<br />
Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee - both once involved in presidential campaigns - have both urged that Mr Assange be &quot;hunted down&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mr Assange's US attorney, Michael Ratner, said the designation of WikiLeaks as an &quot;enemy&quot; had serious implications for the WikiLeaks publisher if he were to be extradited to the US, including possible military detention.<br />
<br />
US Army private Bradley Manning faces a court martial charged with aiding the enemy - identified as al-Qaeda - by transmitting information that, published by WikiLeaks, became available to the enemy.<br />
<br />
Mr Ratner said that under US law it would most likely have been considered criminal for the US Air Force analyst to communicate classified material to journalists and publishers, but those journalists and publishers would not have been considered the enemy or prosecuted.<br />
<br />
&quot;However, in the FOI documents there is no allegation of any actual communication for publication that would aid an enemy of the United States such as al-Qaeda, nor are there allegations that WikiLeaks published such information,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost the entire set of documents is concerned with the analyst's communications with people close to and supporters of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, with the worry that she would disclose classified documents to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks are the 'enemy'. An enemy is dealt with under the laws of war, which could include killing, capturing, detaining without trial, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Australian government has repeatedly denied knowledge of any US intention to charge Mr Assange or seek his extradition.<br />
<br />
However, Australian diplomatic cables released to Fairfax Media under freedom-of-information laws over the past 18 months have confirmed the continuation of an &quot;unprecedented&quot; US Justice Department espionage investigation targeting Mr Assange and WikiLeaks.<br />
<br />
The Australian diplomatic reports canvassed the possibility that the US may eventually seek Mr Assange's extradition on conspiracy or information-theft-related offences to avoid extradition problems arising from the nature of espionage as a political offence and the free-speech protections in the US constitution.<br />
<br />
Mr Assange is scheduled this morning to speak by video link to a meeting on his asylum case on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The meeting will be attended by Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino.<br />
<br />
In a separate FOI decision yesterday, the Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed that the release of Australian diplomatic cables about WikiLeaks and Mr Assange had been the subject of extensive consultation with the US.<br />

</div>Yup. Absolutely true. It's how China and other countries justify blocking a free flow of information on the net and in the media, and how they justify throwing people in jail merely for passing on information.<br />
<br />
One might have hoped the US would take a different view on the sanctity of free speech - noting that Assange wasn't the one to steal the information he merely published it - but given how people are now dying having spent a decade being tortured in US jails without charge or trial it's not all that surprising. <br />

</div>It's important to note how the US defines an enemy combatant when they launch a drone strike: Anyone it hits must have been guilty:<br />

			Obama embraced a disputed method for counting civilian casualties. &#8230; It in effect counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants, according to several administration officials, unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent. <br />
<br />
Counterterrorism officials insist this approach is one of simple logic: people in an area of known terrorist activity, or found with a top Qaeda operative, are probably up to no good. &#8220;Al Qaeda is an insular, paranoid organization&#8212;innocent neighbors don&#8217;t hitchhike rides in the back of trucks headed for the border with guns and bombs,&#8221; said one official. <br />
<br />
This counting method may partly explain the official claims of extraordinarily low collateral deaths. In a speech last year Mr. Brennan, Mr. Obama&#8217;s trusted adviser, said that not a single noncombatant had been killed in a year of strikes. And in a recent interview, a senior administration official said that the number of civilians killed in drone strikes in Pakistan under Mr. Obama was in the &#8220;single digits&#8221;&#8212;and that independent counts of scores or hundreds of civilian deaths unwittingly draw on false propaganda claims by militants.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Especially bad given that Obama has been fond of ordering 'double taps' - where they bomb an area and then bomb it again a few minutes later to kill anyone going to the aid of the injured (sound familiar as a tactic?) Only a terrorist would go to the aid of an injured terrorist after all, right?<br />
<br />
This article is an eye-opener if you haven't read it before: <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2012/05/obama_s_drone_war_the_kill_list_leaves_out_the_real_story_.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_a...al_story_.html</a><br />

			New Zealand's spy agency illegally carried out surveillance on Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom, an official report shows, prompting an apology from the prime minister and dealing a possible blow to US efforts to extradite him.<br />
<br />
Washington wants the 38-year-old German national, also known as Kim Schmitz, to be sent to the US to face charges of internet piracy and breaking copyright laws.<br />
<br />
The report, published on Thursday by the Inspector-General of Intelligence, the watchdog for New Zealand spy agencies, found the Government Communications and Security Bureau (GCSB) had spied on Dotcom, despite a law prohibiting it from snooping on New Zealand citizens and residents. The flamboyant Dotcom attained New Zealand permanent resident status in 2010.<br />
<br />
The prime minister, John Key, said: &quot;It is the GCSB's responsibility to act within the law, and it is hugely disappointing that in this case its actions fell outside the law&quot;, adding the incident was caused by &quot;basic errors&quot;. He apologised to Dotcom and all New Zealanders, saying they were entitled to be protected by the law but it had failed them.<br />
<br />
New Zealand police asked the GCSB to keep track of Dotcom and his colleagues before a raid in late January on his rented country estate near Auckland, in which computers and hard drives, artwork, and cars were confiscated.<br />
<br />
The illegal surveillance may deal another blow to the US extradition case after a New Zealand court ruled in June that search warrants used in the raid on Dotcom's home were illegal. The raid followed a request by the FBI for the arrest of Dotcom for leading a group that netted $175m (£108m) since 2005 by allegedly copying and distributing music, films and other copyrighted content without authorisation.<br />
<br />
Dotcom maintains that the Megaupload site was merely an online storage facility, and has accused Hollywood of lobbying the US government to prosecute him.<br />
<br />
American authorities are appealing against a New Zealand court decision that Dotcom should be allowed to see the evidence on which the extradition hearing will be based.<br />
<br />
The extradition hearing has been delayed until March.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Ok, so the illegal spying and illegal search warrants aren't the US's fault, they are at the feet of the NZ authorities - although it's refreshing that the PM personally apologised for his own citizens being spied on - would Bush or Obama ever publicly apologise for US agencies spying on one of their own citizens? No, the bit that struck me here was how the US are appealing against a court judgement that the accused should be allowed to see the evidence against him. <br />
<br />
Isn't it disappointing that, once again, a principle that America ought to be trumpeting - shouting from the rooftops - they are once again seeking to squash as soon as it is convenient.</blockquote>

yeah, rigging bombs to kill those coming to victim's aid, OR in places where survivors will run to, is a classic, evil tactic long decried by the UK amongst others, like the Omagh Bombing and many in Iraq.<br />

USA's crap is just like Vietnam again. They may win the battles by whacking terrorist leaders, but will lose the war by igniting the whole damn region!<br />
folk dont' want to learn.they want ot  win votes, they want absolute control at any cost, rattle their bomb-penises at each other, etc.<br />
Blech.<br />
<br />
Again, Assagne maybe an attention seeking asshole, but he is NOT a murdering terrorist, not a scumbag selling his nation's secrets for cash<br />
he/wikileaks have exposed seriosu wrong doing, hypocrisy and stupidity.<br />
all this shows the level of petty viciousness and psychotic demand for absolute control that exists, and I hope folk finally get how gawd damn dangerous that is and where it inevitably will lead.</blockquote>

read awesome novel trilogy STARK'S WAR<br />
US army end up being direct tools of the corporations, who want the army ot invade the moon and take it away from the Asians/Europeans who've went there to get aorund the American  control of resources<br />
all the sensible officers left or got booted out years ago, the Marines almost eliminated down to just a few ocmpanies ot guard the politicians/Capitol hill etc, so now they have politically appointed numbnuts running the military who demand soldiers move each step EXACTLY to the plan, literally each step and watch them through helm cams. Think about it, tiem delay, making them move to exact entimetre to simulated 3d bettle plans that are totally useless. <br />
and they have ammo limits because you know, ammo means taxes and taxes are bad for business!<br />
can't recommend it highly enough, you can really see it happening :P<br />
<br />
(and the UK/kindle verison has awesome cover artwork, original US cover is like 25th century rambo :P)<br />
