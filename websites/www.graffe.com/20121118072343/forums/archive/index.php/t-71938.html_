Since I'm guessing you knew about that, what are the criteria you need that the Apple Store doesn't fulfill? Is Paypal a requirement or just how you were doing things previously?<br />
<br />
(edit -- I should add that if paypal is a requirement and you have paypal coming out of your checking account, as an equivalent method go to the &quot;financing&quot; tab in the apple store once you're checking out and have filled out shipping info, select &quot;Bill Me later&quot; and go with that option. As per billmelater.com (https://www.billmelater.com/help/index.xhtml#topic2), you can pay using your banks online bill pay service.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't do that unless you're comfortable waiting an excessively long time (weeks longer than listed amazon shipping time) to receive the card. Ordering from the iTunes seller via amazon gets you an artificial delay.</div></div><hr />

I guess I should have been more specific. I'm in Europe and the only way to top off a US iTunes account is with US gift cards. Apple won't sell those to me directly, neither will most US retailers with an online store. I'm looking for sellers who will email me the code from the gift card rather than physically shipping the card. Paypal is a requirement for me to use my debit account rather than a credit card.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Ah!<br />
<br />
Try PC Game Supply (http://www.pcgamesupply.com/buygames/itunes-gift-cards-online-email/). They recently signed a 2 year contract with Akamai in order to show up EVERYWHERE on the web and they're using verisign (signs that point to them being a fairly large corporation) *and* they look to be a legitimate business from what I can tell via google (http://ratepoint.com/seereviews/24096). They take paypal and return codes. They appear to have a region option but I'm not sure if that's just selecting the card's region or if it has to do with the purchaser's region as well.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Ah. I didn't notice that part. I suppose it's POSSIBLE that they buy them bulk and get them cheaper. I can't imagine grocery stores carrying them in the impulse buy section if they didn't get them at less than face value and can therefore make money off of them.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
O_o<br />
<br />
Why would you need to &quot;activate&quot; a piece of plastic with a code on the back?<br />
Is this some anti-theft protection so they can't just &quot;walk&quot; off the racks like gift cards do?</div></div><hr />

Exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yaxa</div><div class="date">September 5th, 2011, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PC Game Supply actually charges a $4.99 activation fee, so that would explain why they can sell the cards below face value.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Apparently the activation fee differs depending on the face value of the card. A $25 card has a $4.99 fee, a $50 card has a $9.99 fee.</div></div><hr />
