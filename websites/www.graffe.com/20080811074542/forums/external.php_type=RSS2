<br />
Hayes was found dead Sunday at age 65.<br />
<br />
 Relatives found Hayes, 65, unconscious in his home next to a still-running treadmill, said Steve Shular, a spokesman for the Shelby County Sheriff's Department. <br />
<br />
Paramedics attempted to revive him and took him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after 2 p.m., the sheriff's department said.<br />
<br />
No foul play is suspected, the agency said in a written statement.<br />
<br />
Hayes was a longtime songwriter and arranger for Stax Records in Memphis, playing in the studio's backup band and crafting tunes for artists such as Otis Redding and Sam and Dave in the 1960s. <br />
<br />
He released his first solo album in 1967, and his 1969 follow-up, &quot;Hot Buttered Soul,&quot; became a platinum hit.<br />
<br />
In 1971, the theme from &quot;Shaft&quot; topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks and won an Academy Award for best original theme song. The song and the movie score also won Grammy awards for best original score and movie theme.<br />
<br />
Hayes won a third Grammy for pop instrumental performance with the title track to his 1972 &quot;Black Moses&quot; album.<br />
<br />
From the late 1990s through 2006, Hayes provided the voice of &quot;Chef&quot; for Comedy Central's raunchy animated series &quot;South Park,&quot; as well as numerous songs. <br />
<br />
The role introduced him to a new generation of fans, but he left after the show lampooned his own religion, the Church of Scientology.<br />
<br />
He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.</div>

				 Fresh from his trip to Moscow, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is brandishing his new batch of freshly delivered Suhkoi fighters. According to AFP, Chavez said the Su-30s should be a deterrent to the U.S. Navy:<br />
<br />
    &quot;Any gringo ship that sails into brown waters (river waters) will itself turn brown and go to the bottom, because they'll not get through,&quot; Chavez said. <br />
<br />
The U.S. Navy recently reactivated the Fourth Fleet, which is responsible for patrolling the Caribbean. Chavez, in the meantime, has been bulking the military with an extended shopping spree of Russian-made arms. Chavez has repeatedly said that the arms build-up is for defensive purposes; namely to deter what he believes could be a planned U.S. military invasion.<br />
<br />
Back in June, the Venezuelan Sukhois test fired air-to-surface missiles in an exercise called &quot;Patria Socialista&quot; (Socialist Motherland) 2008.

				Chavez's Arms Shopping Spree<br />
By Sharon Weinberger EmailJune 25, 2007 | 1:10:00 PMCategories: Politricks  <br />
<br />
Chavezconfbests04 Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, who fancies himself to be President Bush's nemesis, is leaving Tuesday for a tour that's expected to include some heavy duty arms shopping, with stops planned in <b>Russia</b>, <b>Belarus </b>and <b><i>Iran</i></b>.<br />
<br />
    It&#8217;s reported the Venezuelan President is looking to buy a number of submarines from Russia and possibly an air defense system from Belarus.<br />
<br />
    During the trip, Chavez says he hopes to put the &#8220;finishing touches&#8221; on an agreement to walk away with an integrated air defense system, equipped with a range of 200-300-kilometers.<br />
<br />
Venezuela has already agreed to a number of pricey purchases from Russia worth some $3 billion, including Mi-24 helicopters, Su-30 fighters. and 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles. Over the weekend, Chavez told soldiers: &quot;We are strengthening Venezuela's military power precisely to avoid imperial aggressions and assure peace, not to attack anybody.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's almost as good as my favorite Chavez quote: &#8220;We have detected with intelligence reports plans of a supposed invasion, one that would never happen. But we have to denounce it.&#8221;

Chavez is a MADMAN and here goes Putin selling off his countries stockpiles to him, while starting war with Georgia. Not to mention the monopoly Venezuela has on Western Oil.<br />
<br />
Am I not seeing something correctly here? Tell me I'm the delusional one here because something is NOT adding up. :banghead:</div>

				NBC went to a lot of trouble in order to get major Olympic events like swimming and gymnastics on the air live in primetime in the United States. Now, after getting their wish, the Peacock Network is inexplicably showing those events on tape delay on the west coast.  <br />
<br />
Because the time difference from Beijing to the United States wouldn't allow NBC to air live coverage of events from China, swimming and gymnastics finals were moved to the morning in Beijing. The network paid $894 million to broadcast these Olympics and didn't want a redo of 2000, when every major event in Sydney was shown on tape delay (it's no coincidence that the ratings for those Games were the lowest in history).<br />
<br />
But after enduring months of tough negotiations with the IOC to get the events moved, NBC is doing exactly what they tried to avoid: showing events on tape. Tonight's swimming finals with Michael Phelps, Dara Torres and Katie Hoff were not shown live in the Mountain or Pacific time zones, nor will they be shown for the entirety of the competition. NBC will instead run the east coast feed three hours later; at 8:00 p.m. PT. So, at the moment (midnight on the east coast), viewers on the other side of the country still haven't seen Phelps shatter his own world record in the 400-meter individual medley. <br />
<br />
This is a baffling decision by NBC. It's hard to recall any other occasion when a sporting event has been shown live in one half of the country, but not the other. It's unheard of. Sure, some sporting events start at weird times on the west coast, but that's the norm and people adapt. Like earthquakes, wildfires and actors-turned-governors, it's just how things are. That's why bars have breakfast buffets and bloody mary specials during football season for 10:00 a.m. kickoffs. If live mid-day weekend telecasts are good enough for the NFL and college football, why not the Olympics? <br />
<br />
If the network plans on continuing the delay of the west coast feed, they're subjecting themselves to viewer backlash, poor ratings and upset advertisers. Essentially, NBC strong-armed the IOC into changing around a bulk of the Olympic schedule in order to broadcast live events in two time zones. Great business decision, guys. Why not just push Jay Leno out the door too while you're at it. (Oh, wait.)

</div>the live issue to me is minor, although stupid.  what i find horrible is the lack of real coverage. nbc seems to only care about showing prime time shows.  it's not about covering the olympics.<br />
<br />
if they cared about the events they'd be showing uninterupted coverage. and their adds could be in the corner of the screen.  or they could do a picture in picture kind of deal.  they'd have secondary channels showing everything live all day, 24 hours a day.  and they could keep nbc prime time for highlights, showing alot of events in a short time without all the fluffy commentary.<br />
<br />
they also should have done all the feel good athelete back stories before the olympics started so that people would go into the events already having that knowledge.  or be able to skip it if they already know / dont care.  leaving more time for actual event coverage.<br />
<br />
nbc's policy of sole coverage, without sharing, even on the web, and time delays is why ratings suck. and even after last time's &quot;lowest ratings ever&quot;, they keep everything the same. how brain dead do you need to be?<br />
<br />
my other gripe is more of a regional issue. in dayton ohio time warner has no contract with the local nbc affiliate to broadcast in hd. so for the last 8 years, and 2 summer, 2 winter olympics, we have not had any hd coverage. simply deplorable, irresponsable, and disgusting.  it makes me glad that nbc doesnt show hardly any college football of teams i care about.<br />
<br />
so, are you guys happy with the coverage? i for one am working alot of hours and have little time to watch. but i find it hard to care anyway.<br />
<br />
please keep the politics to yourself though. this is not the thread for that.</div>

David Brooks: Lord of the Memes<br />
By David Brooks<br />
Friday, August 8, 2008<br />
Dear Dr. Kierkegaard,<br />
<br />
All my life I've been a successful pseudo-intellectual, sprinkling quotations from Kafka, Epictetus and Derrida into my conversations, impressing dates and making my friends feel mentally inferior. But over the last few years, it's stopped working. People just look at me blankly. My artificially inflated self-esteem is on the wane. What happened?<br />
<br />
Existential in Exeter<br />
<br />
Dear Existential,<br />
<br />
It pains me to see so many people being pseudo-intellectual in the wrong way. It desecrates the memory of the great poseurs of the past. And it is all the more frustrating because your error is so simple and yet so fundamental.<br />
<br />
You have failed to keep pace with the current code of intellectual one-upsmanship. You have failed to appreciate that over the past few years, there has been a tectonic shift in the basis of good taste.<br />
<br />
You must remember that there have been three epochs of intellectual affectation. The first, lasting from approximately 1400 to 1965, was the great age of snobbery. Cultural artifacts existed in a hierarchy, with opera and fine art at the top, and stripping at the bottom. The social climbing pseud merely had to familiarize himself with the forms at the top of the hierarchy and febrile acolytes would perch at his feet.<br />
<br />
In 1960, for example, he merely had to follow the code of high modernism. He would master some impenetrably difficult work of art from T.S. Eliot or Ezra Pound and then brood contemplatively at parties about Lionel Trilling's misinterpretation of it. A successful date might consist of going to a reading of &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; contemplating the hollowness of the human condition and then going home to drink Russian vodka and suck on the gas pipe.<br />
<br />
This code died sometime in the late 1960s and was replaced by the code of the Higher Eclectica. The old hierarchy of the arts was dismissed as hopelessly reactionary. Instead, any cultural artifact produced by a member of a colonially oppressed out-group was deemed artistically and intellectually superior.<br />
<br />
During this period, status rewards went to the ostentatious cultural omnivores - those who could publicly savor an infinite range of historically hegemonized cultural products. It was necessary to have a record collection that contained &quot;a little bit of everything&quot; (except heavy metal): bluegrass, rap, world music, salsa and Gregorian chant. It was useful to decorate one's living room with African or Thai religious totems - any religion so long as it was one you could not conceivably believe in.<br />
<br />
But on or about June 29, 2007, human character changed. That, of course, was the release date of the first iPhone.<br />
<br />
On that date, media displaced culture. As commenters on The American Scene blog have pointed out, the means of transmission replaced the content of culture as the center of historical excitement and as the marker of social status.<br />
<br />
Now the global thought-leader is defined less by what culture he enjoys than by the smartphone, social bookmarking site, social network and e-mail provider he uses to store and transmit it. (In this era, MySpace is the new leisure suit and an AOL e-mail address is a scarlet letter of techno-shame.)<br />
<br />
Today, Kindle can change the world, but nobody expects much from a mere novel. The brain overshadows the mind. Design overshadows art.<br />
<br />
This transition has produced some new status rules. In the first place, prestige has shifted from the producer of art to the aggregator and the appraiser. Inventors, artists and writers come and go, but buzz is forever. Maximum status goes to the Gladwellian heroes who occupy the convergence points of the Internet infosystem - Web sites like Pitchfork for music, Gizmodo for gadgets, Bookforum for ideas, etc.<br />
<br />
These tastemakers surf the obscure niches of the culture market bringing back fashion-forward nuggets of coolness for their throngs of grateful disciples.<br />
<br />
Second, in order to cement your status in the cultural elite, you want to be already sick of everything no one else has even heard of.<br />
<br />
When you first come across some obscure cultural artifact - an unknown indie band, organic skate sneakers or wireless headphones from Finland - you will want to erupt with ecstatic enthusiasm. This will highlight the importance of your cultural discovery, the fineness of your discerning taste, and your early adopter insiderness for having found it before anyone else.<br />
<br />
Then, a few weeks later, after the object is slightly better known, you will dismiss all the hype with a gesture of putrid disgust. This will demonstrate your lofty superiority to the sluggish masses. It will show how far ahead of the crowd you are and how distantly you have already ventured into the future.<br />
<br />
If you can do this, becoming not only an early adopter, but an early discarder, you will realize greater status rewards than you ever imagined. Remember, cultural epochs come and go, but one-upsmanship is forever.

So I discovered a document while shredding ancient things that made me wonder about average IQ in Kindergarten students along with the validity of the Vane Kindergarten Test. (God, did they experiment on me or something?) <br />
<br />
After finding out the test was found to be judged badly, I encountered the posted article. <br />
<br />

				Recent studies on sexual activity among adolescents and young adults show that being an &quot;average Joe&quot; may have benefits outside of the classroom.<br />
<br />
The studies show that female and male adolescents with an IQ score either below 70 or above 110 are more likely to be virgins.<br />
<br />
Adolescents with IQ scores ranging from 70 to 110 had the lowest probability of virginity, according to two researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The average IQ score is 90 to 110.<br />
<br />
Mariah Mantsun Cheng, a research associate, and J. Richard Udry, professor of maternal and child health and sociology, both from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, conducted the study. They discovered that 39.8 percent of boys with an average IQ score have had sex while 29.2 percent of boys with an IQ above 110 have had sex.<br />
<br />
They also found that 63.3 percent of adolescent men and 81.6 percent of women with IQ scores below average have never had sex and most have had fewer experiences of romantic attraction.<br />
Another study in Gene Expression Magazine entitled &quot;Intercourse and Intelligence&quot; confirms this data, citing research that shows a bell-shaped relationship between IQ scores and sex.<br />
<br />
According to the research, an adolescent with an IQ score of 100 was 1.5 to 5 times more likely to have had intercourse than an adolescent with an above average score of about 120 to 130.<br />
<br />
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) along with nationwide university studies support this research.<br />
<br />
The CDC states that by age 19, 80 percent of men and 75 percent of women lose their virginity. According to a survey held by Counterpoint Magazine at Wellesley College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 60 percent of undergraduates at Wellesley are virgins and 47 percent of undergraduates at MIT are currently virgins.<br />
<br />
The study at Wellesley also broke the research down by majors. It found that no studio art majors were virgins while 72 percent of biology majors and 83 percent of biochemistry and math majors were virgins.<br />
<br />
Cheng said the research also indicated that boys with lower IQ scores are more likely to be attracted to the same sex compared with average boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;While the majority of adolescents with lower cognitive abilities have not had sex,&quot; Cheng said, &quot;among those who are sexually active, especially for girls, are much less likely to use contraceptives, having a higher risk of pregnancy as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cheng and Udry's study is an ongoing longitudinal study that began in 1994.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are the same people in the study now as there were when it began in 1994,&quot; Udry added.

</div>Firstly, LOL at studio art. <br />
<br />
Secondly, &quot;Virginity&quot; is used like it's a Disease! God! WE HAVE TO GET RID OF IT! WE MUST FIND AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AND CURE FOR VIRGINITY!<br />
<br />
Thirdly, there's GOT to be something missing here. The data gives what it gives but something here bothers me. Like the fact I probably have an IQ of over 140 or something. I'm NOT-screwed! :O</div>

			<description>Just heard from his wife - he is in the hospital currently getting prepped for surgery to remove his appendix. Lys will be in the hospital tonight and tomorrow, on bed rest for 6 days and light duty for 6 weeks or so. While not life threatening, thoughts/prayers/positive energy is appreciated.</description>

				The build up of naval forces in the Gulf will be one of the largest multi-national naval armadas since the First and Second Gulf Wars. The intent is to create a US/EU naval blockade (which is an Act of War under international law) around Iran (with supporting air and land elements) to prevent the shipment of benzene and certain other refined oil products headed to Iranian ports. Iran has limited domestic oil refining capacity and imports 40% of its benzene. Cutting off benzene and other key products would cripple the Iranian economy. The neo-cons are counting on such a blockade launching a war with Iran.

What will this do for the price of oil?<br />

Will Congress get involved if it looks like this is just a precursor to start trouble??</div>
