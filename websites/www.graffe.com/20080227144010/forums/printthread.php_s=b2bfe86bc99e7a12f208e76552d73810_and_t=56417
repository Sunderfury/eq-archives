		<div>For Information:<br />
<br />
We are hoping to get an update 4 build to test tomorrow. While this update has many fixes in it here are some of the larger additions and changes.<br />
<br />
Vanguard Update 4<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Flying Mounts<br />
Riftway Revamp<br />
Character Optimizations / Helmets<br />
Overland Raid<br />
Class Updates<br />
Veteran Rewards<br />
Refund Point Revamp<br />
Misc.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Flying Mounts<br />
<br />
With Update 4 we have added the first two permanent flying mounts into Vanguard. Griffons and wyverns are now available for players to attain. Head to Southwatch to begin the griffon quest and to Ancient Port Warehouse for the wyvern.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Riftway Revamp<br />
<br />
Also featured in Update 4 is a revamp to the riftway system. At level 10, once arriving at the first outpost after the newbie experience, the player will encounter the first riftway stone. These riftways are placed within all similarly leveled outposts, and are available immediately as options for travel. In addition, there will be a quest-giver at each riftway with ‘region introduction quests', giving an overview of what content is to be found in each region as well as a delivery quest to visit a main quest giver in that region located near the riftway.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
Riftway locations are represented on the map. When moused over they will show an outpost name, region name, and level range. If the riftway is available to the player it will show up in color, and if not then it will be grey. When an available riftway location is clicked and the player has the requisite number of riftway shards, the shards are consumed and the player is teleported to that location.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cost<br />
<br />
Riftways will be tiered and color coded by level range and each tier will take a different amount of coin to travel. This will ensure that lower level players should always be able to afford to get to where they need to go while at the same time not trivializing the cost for higher level players.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Character Optimizations / Helmets<br />
<br />
These two updates go hand in hand, because one allows us to do the other. First, we have done a lot of optimizations to player characters. By eliminating some of the extra bones that only affected minor, barely visible things in places such as the face we were able to add visible helmets - which would have otherwise been interfered with by those extra bones. The end result is slightly less customization in the facial area (but nothing drastic), better performance for the character models and brand new visible helmets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Overland Raid<br />
<br />
Many years after being driven into hiding by his murderous brothers, Fengrot Foulbreath has emerged from his slumber beneath the stagnant waters of Thelaseen. Although diminutive compared to his brothers, Fengrot makes up for this by being twice as cruel and ill-tempered as any of the other Sons of Torsheim. Having made a pact with Krigus, spirit of disease and decay, Fengrot hopes to use the spirit's power to destroy his most hated enemy - his brother, Torkald Who Mourns.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fengrot is an overland raid target appropriate for 18 well equipped, high level players.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Class Updates<br />
<br />
With GU4 the Druid, Necromancer, and Dread Knight class adjustments go live. The Shaman Patron quest change also goes live. Here are the details for each area and information on what we would like to test.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
The druid's dps has been increased and the class focus has shifted toward using Phenomena much more often than previously. We want the class to function by using Phenomena roughly 30-40% of their casts. We accommodated this by lowering phenomena costs over all and by reducing the level and refresh time of Hierophant's Boon.<br />
<br />
The main goal of testing the druid is to find if the new dps is satisfactory and if players feel that the use of Phenomena is acceptable and reaches our goal. Also players should be looking to see if there are any bugs or if there is anything that is on test that does not match the patch notes. Feedback regarding these changes should be given to the Druid class lead or posted on the forums.<br />
<br />
Necromancer<br />
<br />
The main focus of the necromancer adjustments was to fix bugs, focus the abilities and to make the selection between Wraith and Lich meaningful. We accomplished this by fixing bugs (obviously) and adding two new abilities to the class. Each choice has been given a unique ability. This unique ability grants bonuses to the strength of that form. For example the Wraith ability, Ghastly Revenge, makes all direct damage spells the necro has stronger when used.<br />
<br />
The main goal for testing these changes is to make sure that the bug fixes worked properly, there are no new bugs and that the buffs granted by the new abilities are substantial enough to make the choice interesting. Feedback on these changes should be given to the Necromancer class lead or posted on the forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dread Knight<br />
<br />
Along with warrior and paladin changes, the dread knight was given a weapon preference. Dread Knights have had several adjustments to allow them to tank while wielding a 2 handed weapon. This will grant them higher dps and increased threat generation while tanking. Bug fixes and ability focusing were minor focuses during this pass.<br />
<br />
When testing be sure to note tanking stats such as hate, mitigation and block value to make sure that you can still successfully fill your role. Also, be sure that the abilities changed reflect the patch notes correctly. Feedback on these changes should be given to the Dread Knight class lead or posted on the forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
The shaman patron quests have been redone and an option to deselect a patron and select a new one is now available.<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
<br />
Yes the paladin changes are there as well. Sorry did not mean to leave that note out.<br />
<br />
Please focus on completing this quest, unselecting and reselecting your patron. We would also like feedback on the quest usability and prices of the respec totems. Feedback on these changes should be given to the Shaman class lead or posted on the forums.<br />
<br />
6. Veteran Rewards<br />
<br />
Veteran Rewards have been added to the /claim window. Rewards include titles, special items (such as vanity pets) and a set of furniture to place inside your house. Veteran rewards are available for players who have had active accounts for six months or more. Additional rewards are available every two months after that. Enjoy!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
7. Refund Point Revamp<br />
<br />
Refund points are now purchasable from adventuring and crafting trainers. Each point now refunds all of your allocated points up to your current level. Your first refund is free, all refunds after that increase in price. To help with allocation we have added a max button to the attribute section of the character sheet.<br />
<br />

8. Misc<br />
<br />
Bug Fixing<br />
<br />
A good deal of time this update, especially for the programming department, has been spent fixing bugs. We tried to target issues that fell into one of two categories. First we obviously wanted to make sure any game breaking issues or bugs were fixed but after that we tried to focus on getting rid of as many small, annoying bugs as possible. Usability is a big focus, and we want to make sure the play experience is as seamless for players as possible. A full list of our bug fixes can be found below.<br />
<br />
Harvesting<br />
<br />
All harvesting nodes now use a tier specific labeling on their names and a consistent look regardless of rarity. They way they spawn has not been adjusted. The new display names are as follows<br />

<br />
Green Rifts: 25 Copper<br />
<br />
Blue Rifts: 2.5 Silver<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Item/NPC changes<br />
<br />

<br />
All quest rewards have had a bump up in power.<br />
<br />
All attuning dusts are now available for purchase on exotic goods vendors.<br />
<br />
All named and bosses with placeholders will now spawn more often.<br />
<br />
All named drops are now BOP and no longer deconstructable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please when you see this on test take some time to try out these changes and give us some feedback. We will try to update test as much as possible before the update is ready to go live. We would also like to schedule some focus testing next week, I will post details once we know when.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A note on bugs:<br />
<br />
We have fixed several bugs with this update I cannot begin to list all fixes as this is not meant to be a set of patch notes. It is more a list of things we want people to look at on test and give feedback.<br />
<br />
To placate some of you here are some fixes off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
Tehatamani spawnign issues fixed.<br />
<br />
Craigwind shrines issues fixed.<br />
<br />
Hegnarian spawn issues fixed and some adjustments to resolve bottleneck issues.<br />
<br />
Ceros island content has been adjusted.<br />
<br />
Legendary crafted item levels fixed.<br />
<br />
Sigil droprate has been increased slightly.<br />
<br />
Anything else I will have to look through when I get into the office on Tuesday.</div>

		<div>When are the Sorc Changes going in? It's been like 2 months and now it seems we're forgotton. Druids were just brought up recently and they're going live before us? <br />
<br />
 And some other things... Named drops BoP and not deconned? What? So they are now either a huge upgrade for someone or else complete trash? How does that make sense? We're already letting a lot of APW gear &quot;rot&quot;. I understand that they're trying to combat farming, but this is only going to lead to more boredom once your guild advances through APW. <br />
<br />
 Why the change to the harvesting node names? Was it really that difficult for someone to figure out or ask what tier something was? Man, this game is easy enough, I just don't understand any reason to dumb it down any more than it already is. <br />

		<div>renaming the nodes does NOT make the game too easy.  The BOP does however  make it slightly harder because now you can't decon and get ultra rare items as often.  renaming the nodes will not make any impact as you are still having to look for those nodes.. the name will do nothing but make it take 1 second2 to realize what tier a harvesting node is rather than 7 seconds. Which makes it easier for new come'ers to recognize what they can and can't harvest.  That does hardly anything because anyone can look online in 2 minutes and learn the names of the nodes which appear in each tier.  To remember it for a bit lets say 5 minutes including look up time.  So all that does is saves a few new comers 5 minutes of thier time looking online.. or saves them getting it from OOC.</div>

If it goes in like I'm told it now exists on test, this is an outright lie, unless you take &quot;nothing drastic&quot; to mean &quot;instead of six pages of sliders, you now have 4 stock faces with no sliders at all.&quot; Everyone I have talked to who has tried it is completely incensed on how dramatically it changed their character, and how much everyone looks the same, and how horrible looking all the choices are. It would seem quite a few are angry enough to cancel their account over it. It is also possible the ones I have heard discussing it were exaggerating the case, so I've put in to copy my character to test to see for myself. These are generally reliable people though.<br />
<br />
I am hoping this is just a &quot;first pass&quot; and will have more customization added before it goes live, but I must confess I'm not real optimistic.</div>

pretty sad to me I spent a lot of time on some of the faces i chose.  but cosmetically its not enough to make me leave.<br />

all gear has been greatly upgraded (minus apw) which includes RI stuff, lucent stuff, and it is much closer to raid gear now (sad but true)<br />

I dont think so. At release the game was... hm... very &quot;userunfriendly&quot;. <br />
Sure there are things i dont like (the update of the faces are too extrem). But the core of the game is still the same. (and its good)<br />
<br />
There are only 20k-30k subscriptions for Vanguard and so the dev-Team is really small. <br />
<br />
There is no other MMORPG that is like Vanguard coming. <br />
<br />
AoC? Its extrem causal. Fast Leveling, ultrasmall dungeons and the fighting system is not the &quot;revolution&quot; as the devs shouted. Its more easy then Vanguard... (and many many big bugs still in the beta)<br />
<br />
Warhammer Online? PvP with WoW graphics. <br />
<br />
Aion? There is no raidcontent yet.. and there are no information for raidcontent yet.. there are really few &quot;real&quot; information aber Aion..<br />
<br />
So im sticking with Vanguard. There is no other mmorpg which would be able to fill the hole if would stop playing Vanguard...</div>

		<div>As jades has said NO SORCEROR content or update till next patch. We are the hardest as we are the most screwed up and most effort to change our abilities or add to them has been met with coding failure so far.<br />
<br />
As for the character customization changes, i really do not care if they will indeed boost up performance for the benefit of using higher configuration settings for the overal environment detail. As the developers ahd stated these changes had to be done for both performance and the use of helmets so that ears or jaws would not stick out from helmets.<br />
<br />
Riftway system is ok for the pve aspect and i think i like it more epsecially if we get the flying mount Still hope tha t the end quest is not to kill the apw dragon as it has been rumoured cause that would simly freak me off and cancell right away). The one thing i really did not like and would yet beg J<b><font size="5">ades to validate</font></b> for me is the fact that the developers have made a coding error by forcing anyone who casts to get dismounted. You see you cannot use invi when you are on a horse so you cannot run about invisible on your mount.<br />
<br />
It says also that ALL attuning crystals are purchasable from the exotic vendor guy, hope this includes then attuning crystals of health which ar as rare as protection crystals.... <br />
The rest of the resonating crystals should be drops from mobs according to people.<br />
<br />
The real reason that keep me still in this game ( i have cancelled twice so far only to revoke it because of jades words) is the fact that after at least 8 months of having totally fucke up with the sorceror as a class in pvp i MIGHT still get some revamp. I lalso MIGHT still not be a 2 buff mage in raids with no other presence other than that of a &quot;cowering&quot; dpser who will give up his real dps power for the sake of health armour so as not to die so often and pray that aggro management from MT will keep him alive.<br />
<br />
Personally jades i expect developers to give word within a month of what is going to happen to sorcerors in the future, pvp or pve. I have not  pvped on sorceror intensely anyway for over 8 months other than the guild duels we hold so often to know the other classes in pvp. But as even emilia has said fuck pvp &quot;for now&quot;. No word even on the pve aspects other than those forms which are not so important in my opinion they way they have been designed.<br />
<br />
I have been criticised on boards for my &quot;rough&quot; posts on how fucked up we are as a class, how screwed up developers and coding are and yet i see people cancelling for reasons other than gameplay. <br />
<br />
And one more observation, which i hope will not be taken wrongly as people here so often do. I have seen developers posting quite so often on other class boards but never here. That proves to me how they are cowering for what they have to done to this class. <br />
<br />
So back to test server to see things more indepth, and chill out. We are the best paying (not paid) beta testers in the history of online mmorpgs.</div>

		<div>a lot of mid-ranged yellow items have had a significant to almost ridiculous boost in their stats, lucent faction rewards as well, swamp faction gear have had a negligible boost as well.<br />
<br />
Attuning crystals of all sort can now be bought indeed at exotic goods vendors dirt cheap, that included attuning crystals of health and new crafting items i had not seen in game before . For example making a focus required attuning of power and sorcery crystal. No there are attuning for fire ice etc etc etc. So i guess there are a whole lot new crafting weapons introduced. <br />
<br />
Druids get some really neat new features, new pets, new instant heal, new illusion that makes them look like an ant and necros, I read on a post can even fear in pvp.<br />
<br />
I honestly do not believe after all the posts and contradictions and disagreements i have seen on forums here that you guys will simply cancel subscription over a matter i really think is sooo trivial. Above ALL the people who post on these forums i should have been the one to fly off the handle cause for another 2 months i will be hiding from pvp even more, drooling over the new skills and abilities necros druids paladins and shamans have got. I , of all people am now even more intrigued as to what developers hold for us in the next update. <br />
<br />
So get a grip of yourself and as so many people have suggested enjoy the game even if you still are a pathetic sorceror who can only buff 2 skills in the raid , die first aggro, got straight to group 4 when fighting the winged %$^%$%^ in the skypirates cause you MISS even with more than 400 total accuracy and get raped in pvp all the time by ALL OTHER CLASSES :PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP</div>

For once John Alex i FINALLY agree with you lol.... i think your manner in PRESENTING this is questionable ... but i do agree... even though we sorcs are screwed... we are WAY BETTER off than we were Back and before the server merge.  I ended up getting to 45 in march. I leveled really fast doing mostly repetitive missives and stuff JUST for levels because my guild was rushing us to level before summer time.  So i didn't get to explore telon the way i wanted to.  And every time i fired a couple shots i was getting agro, having a monster WARP to me and one shot me.  Now things are different and a sorc is soo much fun to play again that in order to relive what i missed i created another sorc alt to level and play... I just really do have soo much fun playing it... The alternative games out there are not very promiseing.  And i have been to most except the EQ games which i am not very interested in because of what i hear and its just way to time consuming.  EQ2 sounds interesting though but i dont really like the graphics.  Anyways... I want to stick vanguard out.. its the ONLY game in which the OTHER classes other than sorcs are interesting enough for me to play.</div>

		<div>Let me just be clear, I have not stopped playing because of the vast improvements to perfomance or the bug fixes.<br />
<br />
What has pushed me (and pushed me, and pushed me, time and time again) are the compleate overhauls to the games core features and systems in an atempt to gain apeal to more players.<br />
If they just focused on fixing the bugs, improving perfomance and adding content instead of re-vamping existing content over and over then they could re-launch the game and get a stable player base.<br />
<br />
As it is they have &quot;polished&quot; core systems so much that they bear no resemblance to the game I was promised and fell in love with. Its not any one thing, or even this GU as a whole, but this GU, after so many before just fails to deliver.<br />
<br />
From my perspective if there still tweaking the roles of crafted vs group vs raid gear like this, with a sledge hammer, after this amount of time, then there the stuff that trully matters to me, like breathing some life into a pretty but lifeless world, will not be addressed for years to come.<br />
<br />
No ill feelings to the dev team, or any players, rather best of luck. <br />
I've been patient and waited a year for SOE to back up its commitment to this game, but I'm just not seeing it forthcomming. If they were serious about finishing the game they would have invested in it rather than seek imediate return on investment by culling the staff back to the skelleton crew that currently maintains it.<br />

				<div>Originally Posted by <strong>Daeanor</strong></div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">If it goes in like I'm told it now exists on test, this is an outright lie, unless you take &quot;nothing drastic&quot; to mean &quot;instead of six pages of sliders, you now have 4 stock faces with no sliders at all.&quot; Everyone I have talked to who has tried it is completely incensed on how dramatically it changed their character, and how much everyone looks the same, and how horrible looking all the choices are. It would seem quite a few are angry enough to cancel their account over it. It is also possible the ones I have heard discussing it were exaggerating the case, so I've put in to copy my character to test to see for myself. These are generally reliable people though.<br />
<br />
I am hoping this is just a &quot;first pass&quot; and will have more customization added before it goes live, but I must confess I'm not real optimistic.</div>

This sounds disturbing.  The description made it sound like it was just some barely noticeable facial bones however if there are devasting reductions in customization the game will be moving backward in that regard.  <br />
<br />
Many of the GU 4 Updates sound allright but the speed at which the game is reforming itself is so slow that it is jeopardizing any chances for achieving the capacity to release expansions or conduct game updates that would bring about what could have been.  The fixes really needed to be present almost at the start or have been implemented much faster.  The size of the developer team interfered with this though.</div>

		<div>Well i also look at the bright/lame side of things..... I go everywhere around hunting sorcerors psi paladins dks and warriors form the other enemy guilds that are on our kos list and the bard simply rocks there. I even tried to psychologically analyze this behaviour of mine but what the hell , i got an easy answer... it is addictive and it is fun. There is nothing else to do right now other than hunt in island of madness or harvest or do endless apw..... even now i get bored by that. <br />
<br />
As i said it is anticipation of the things to come that keeps me in this game apart from the awesome and jaw-dropping graphics of this game. All my greek friends just fled the game a long time ago and went back to wow ( bleah bleah). <br />
<br />
I had a look at warhammer and it seems a bit wowish to me. Not bad graphics but basic and very cartoonlike. A lot of the changes that i saw on the test server , i finally resolved, are indeed AWESOME ..... no more attuning of health stuoid farming, no more lining up for domination on island of madness for crystals, no more decon failure ( i could seriously grasp silius by the neck and stranggle him over and over again for that painful shit of decon failure). <br />
<br />
But finally and above all no matter how i whine and no matter how many times i have cancelled subscription i finally decided that the guild i am in on sartok (law) is an awesome guild wiht really nice people, there is still some basic pvp going on that keeps interest alive and FINALLY ( i like repeating myself sometimes) it is ANTICIPATION for the things to come. <br />
<br />
I know jades has been silent for quite some time. I learnt from other class leads the sad truth about class leads being ignored invariably by developers, even them being in the dark about upcoming changes, but i am a stubborn mule asshole myself who will stick around with the last hope of seeing  the disaster or revolution of sorcerors. I will stay for the last straw and whine and whine. In any case we expect the changes to come in 2 month..... no game ahead in those 2 months for me<br />
<br />
I have even a good solution for you guys that worked fine for me and i swear it was awesome as an experience ........... start questing again even now at lvl 50. For about 4 days i found out i have not seen even 1/50th of the vast world vanguard has.......... Went to dungeons i have never been before ( got *&amp;*&amp;* pawned even at lvl 50 %#$#%^#$ noob sorc) but i enjoyed it....... my xp bar is at 60% on the red now :PPPPP</div>

		<div>To tell you the truth, I seriously think something is coming for us. I can't tell you when, because I don't know, but that's what I feel.<br />
<br />
I've done some dps tests with Avair today.<br />
And, I can't tell you why, but I seriously feel he has something planned for us.<br />
(Actualy, there is something planned)<br />
<br />
He want to wait until he gets something more solid, something pre-made, not only on paper, before announcing me what is his plans.<br />
<br />
And... even if we have been in the shadow for a long period, devs are doing realy good jobs. They are not alot and when comes the time for them to listen to us, classlead, they realy do. (They have many class to care about, and for the numbers they are, wow, I'm surprised)<br />
<br />
I trust in Avair. He knows we aren't the top dps class atm and that we should, and he will do everything to make it happen in a futur that is more close then u can imagine :P<br />
<br />
His goal: give us a better combat system, raise our non-CV spells and not making us spam Chaos Volley.<br />
How?<br />
I don't know, he doesn't wanted to tell me :P. But I'll give you more info when I'll get more.</div>
