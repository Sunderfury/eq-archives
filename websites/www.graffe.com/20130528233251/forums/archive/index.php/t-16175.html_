The women put their hands on their legs, gyrate their way down, shake their rear and then do a couple of side turns. Really ... all they're missing is a pole.</div></div><hr />

Hah... sweet. Next thing you know they'll make up an animation enabling males and females to give their mates lapdances. <br />
<br />
Though from the sound of it, I guess if the Night Elf female were standing closely in front of a male who were sitting, it's just as good.  :D</div></div><hr />

It's exactly the same as the orc dance, which I don't understand why. Dwarves deserve their own unique dance -- maybe falling over in drunken stupor or something, dammit!</div></div><hr />

I liked the dance myself and I can't wait to see the female version now that you guys mention what it looks like.</div></div><hr />

Dances like the one you describe with the night elf female = gasoline.<br />

Sigh.  Well, WoW just went down a couple notches in my book.  It was inevitable.  Still, the good still seems to outweigh the bad.  Hope nothing more crops up that turns me off of the game.</div></div><hr />

All the other male dances I've seen for other races were amusing or fun. Wouldn't worry too much about it. ;)</div></div><hr />

Other than that, yeah, they're all good.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the gnome one fits their personality SO well. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Graffe's gnome community partially inspired it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/dance<br />
/dance1<br />
/dance2<br />
/dance3<br />
/dance4<br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
This could be applied to any emote I guess, not sure what it would take to implement, just adding an idea to the rapidly growing pile. =)<br />

Just for a bit of RP'ing variety =)<br />

They'd probably listen to metal or industrial, so Dwarves need to headbang.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxyn</div><div class="date">April 8th, 2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally i think they should make all dances available to all races.<br />
Otherwise there'll be too many players complaining that their character isn't represented by their race's dance animation.<br />
<br />
as for whether the NE female dance is a stripper dance... i dunno.  If it is, its the most tame stripper dance ever.  Not to mention nowhere near as bad as even the dancing in GTA.  And have you been to a run-of-the-mill dance club lately?  The NE's are pretty tame compared to what's 'hip with the kids'.  <br />
<br />
Strippers could learn a thing or two from what teenagers consider casual.</div></div><hr />
