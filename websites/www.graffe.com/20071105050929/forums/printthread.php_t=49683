		<div>Heya! As promised I am posting the full list that I have come up with and not excludeing anything, there are also a few new changes I know of coming out  these are things I'm going to call spoilers :P. I am not going to post ALL of the details (because admit it, it is more fun for you to figure out things for yourself don'tcha think? ;) ), But I will post enough information so that you know what is being done with the class while the devs are looking at it, so *hopefully* everyone is as happy as possible.<br />
<br />
For starters,<br />
<br />
[Disclaimer] Keep in mind, I got like 3 PMs from people making sure stuff was on here, so if somehow, some &quot;major bug or issue&quot; didn't make it on here, then you really can't go &quot;OMFG YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING&quot; as I gave you the perfect chance to make sure this &quot;major bug or issue&quot; would make it on this list. [/Disclaimer]<br />
<br />
Also, on an added note, I don't respond to flames :P)<br />
<br />
<b>Grimore&#8217;s List of Sorcerer Issues (In No particular order)</b><br />
<br />
1. Rings &#8211; Upon dropping group and sometimes when chunking, the buff the rings give will normally drop, making us have to unequip and reequip the ring.<br />
<br />
2. Manashards &#8211; The one-hour recast time is a bit extreme and makes the spell not very efficient, making the recast 15m or 30m would make the spell a lot more useful<br />
<br />
3. Counter Spelling &#8211; With the current system it is extremely difficult to know what your offensive target is casting, which makes knowing whether to reflect or nullify a spell guesswork mostly (meaning you have to judge by spell cast icons). Making the icons either say the name of the spell, or something that will allow players to know if the spell is a nuke buff or heal, would making Countering a lot more efficient and effective. Additionally, Couter Spelling does not work in PVP (so I am told) this defiantly needs to be corrected.<br />
<br />
4. Flame Spear and Meteor Storm &#8211; casting time on both of these spells is too long, cutting it down to 4 seconds would make them both more efficient, additionally the recasts on them are also a bit extreme too, cutting flame spear down the same as Char&#8217;s and making Meteor storms no more then 20 seconds, would make both spells much more efficient and useful. Also, reducing the mana cost of Meteor Storm by half (making it 500-600 Mana cost) would make the spell more cost efficient as well.<br />
<br />
5. Amplification Spells &#8211; Reducing the recast time of all of these spells to 2 or 3 minutes would make them much more effect and efficient, and also allow a bit more of a DPS pick-up.<br />
<br />
6. Chromatic Barrier &#8211; Currently, there is almost no point to this spell, the resistance doesn&#8217;t do to terribly much as a whole, and the reflection portion of the spell rarely (if ever) works. From a PVE stand point, the spell needs a bit of a boost, from a PVP standpoint the spell needs a big fix.<br />
<br />
7. Mirror/Nullifying Wards &#8211; They are fairly inefficient right now, reducing the mana cost would make these spells a lot more effective, and used a lot more often.<br />
<br />
8. Color Spray &#8211; The effect appears to be blocked by angles, or other invisible obstacles (for example, If you are on a step below your mob on some stairs, and the mob is up a bit, the spray will miss the mob, even though the mob is technically in range, and is being directly looked at). Additionally, if the graphic could represent the area of effect better, it would give a better idea of what does and doesn&#8217;t get hit.<br />
<br />
9. AoE spells in General &#8211; A tool of some sort that will display what mobs the spell will hit would be extremely helpful in judging distances between mobs and if spells will land on them.<br />
<br />
10. Finishers &#8211; When a player is &#8220;too fast&#8221; on trying to cast a finisher, the finishers will actually &#8220;gray out&#8221; and then will not be castable. This is the most common with Mimic.<br />
<br />
11. Fire DoT &#8211; Besides the fact that I Don&#8217;t believe that DoTs fit the Sorc Class, The DoTs cancel each other out at times, and the DoT on Char appears to be higher then that of incinerate, they either need to stack, or Incinerate&#8217;s DoT needs to be boosted in damage.<br />
<br />
12. Chaos Volley - When the spell is resisted it still harms the caster, not sure if this is intended, but several people will agree that this should probably not happen. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now, that is my list *as of now* at around 8 CST Friday evening I am going to compile that list, along with feedback from you guys about the list (and maybe some added things if they come to my attention) and then ship off the completed list. <br />
<br />
This doesn't mean these are the *only* things wrong with the class, these are simply alot of the things that are buggy the crap out of people, and things that really need to be changed for the better.<br />
<br />
ADDITIONALLY, YOU WILL NOTICE SOME OF THIS STUFF HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE (like the flame spear thing), The Devs have seen this incomplete list, as well as a list from Quellian and have already started reviewing the Sorcerer class (as of Wednesday). This leads to the next section of this post.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Fun Stuff that is in the process of coming out or changing. <u>(Keep in mind this is what I have been told, I am not sure if any of this is subject to change, consider this your disclaimer. I was told this is stuff that is going to happen, but you guys have been around long enough to know nothing is offically set in stone until it is live)</u><br />
<br />
We are getting 2 new nukes, 1 Fire nuke and 1 Cold Nuke. One is going to be a high damage slight slower casting time spell with a chance for a passive effect. The other is going to be a PVPer's New friend, a quick casting low damage spell, with a very nice effect that deals with mobs/people casting.<br />
<br />
Wards are being turned into a group wide spell with a 6 second casting time, as far as I know everything else on them is remaining them same.<br />
<br />
Flame Spear is changing, You've probably already seen the patch notes from test.<br />
<br />
A few buffs are being added for different purposes for things such as (but not limited to) Evocation, and Spell Identification.<br />
<br />
An &quot;anti-magic&quot; aura is being given to us, I'll let you use your imagination on what that will do ;)<br />
<br />
&quot;Second Finisher Chains&quot; are being added, these are going to work something like: <div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Quote:</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
So there you are, that is my list as promised, and a few spoilers on upcoming changes, as promised. Please post feedback or any questions here so they can be addressed, please refrain from saying the world is coming to an end or anything of the sort :P. Also, please please please, If you think I missed something that desperately needs to be addressed in my last, by all means  please let me know.<br />
<br />
(PS: I'm not that good at posting big things like this :P and the list was originally scribbles on a notepad, so I hope everything came out sounding alright lol)<br />

<br />
Invis - Graphics sometimes break when zoning, inconsistancy of duration time, I know this is intended, but it's annoying as hell. I would rather have a lesser duration but it last.<br />
<br />
Levitate Ring - This is prob more for all classes, but I know trying to run up stairs is a nightmare. Which I must say doesn't really bother me personally, easy solution, just take off the ring, but I had seen it posted elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I will keep it short, thanks for the list and info, I just added these from what I had seen on another site. I think the list above is definately more important than what I added.<br />

THAT is really really nice and definitly a step in the right direction!<br />
<br />
On the contrary I am a bit dubious on the +Evo buff, since a dev stated recently that +Evo does basically nothing above cap. And which sorcerer isn't at cap in evocation ? A +accuracy would be most welcome though.<br />
<br />
Now just need (but that probably won't happen before a long time, if only it happens one day), a mechanism ala virtue points/blood union with associated spells. And some more situational nuke (execute...)</div>

		<div>One cool thing to add would be actually spell combinations , just like disciples have. They call them endowments. You cast 3 or so spells in certain order to create the endowment effect. Now discs have atleast heal and such, but we should have different style of effects. Perhaps self only, single defensive target or offensive target. <br />
<br />
This would make us want to cast other spells too to get the effects.</div>

I made Avair aware of the issues involving the Countering System and PVP, he already knew it was having problems but I just let him know that players are getting really really annoyed by it. Any further feedback you can give on this subject would also be appreciated :). (Keep in mind I don't play on PVP, so any bugs about PVP that I need to make known to the devs is going to come straight from forum feedback basically.)<br />
<br />
Being able to AoE yourself is kinda amuseing :P but yea probably a bug. hehe.</div>

		<div>Excellent stuff Grim, as you know I was one of the ones that PM'd you and my biggest concern was the pvp countering.<br />
<br />
We should fear sword and bow in this game being a caster, and this is in part true with our class nemesis being rangers, rogues can kill us in the time it takes me to drag my mouse over to the quickbar to try and do something about it, and dreadknights have a nasty habit of keeping you close just when you dont want to be...but others casters seem to be able to kill us VERY quickly also right now.<br />
<br />
However, the above list got my interest with the abilities that let us control spellcasters.  We don't have pets and good buffs or indeed heals, so controlling enemy spellcasters sounds a very intersting idea with the anti magic aura!  Any help we get with spell identification will be more than welcome for me, but add to this other spells and abilities and I don't think you'll see people asking for silence back - the flavour will return to the class!<br />
<br />
In pvp, spell ID does not fire (EVER) and spell effects are very very difficult to manually recognise.  The spell works fine in pve but both could do with clearer icons or a description.  For example the undead around Spires Keep use our Energy Rift icon for healing, other mobs ingame use it as an offensive spell!!  Pretty unfair even if you wanted to make it hard and put more emphasis on a skilled player.  (and let's not get into a D&amp;D type debate about harm type spell healing undead please lol) :D<br />

PS - Chromatic barrier could be the key here imo.  Buff this protection spells power and make it a hard choice between this and flame barrier.  Right now it's a no brainer.  I tried sleeping another sorcerer a few days ago and didn't get slept myself, it just absorbed it.  If reflections worked...wow.<br />
<br />
On another note, I've also been concerned in the past about the Taqmir's line...it's hardly ever used now in pve and is extinct in pvp.  Anyone trying to stand still casting for that long will lose 99 times out of 100!  So, the recent changes on the test server right now for me are no good...it's not the energy cost of the spell that's the problem.  It's the damage against cast time ratio that's wrong.  This has been made better for flame spear with the 4s cast time...is the same to be done to Taqmirs?  I &lt;3 Taqmir's :D<br />
<br />
Great job on all that you've done.</div>

Also with Chaos Volley the dmg you take from feedback does not reset when you change mobs it continues to go up but the dmg to mob is reset.  Also the dmg to a single mob seems to reset back down randomly when trying to ramp up dmg.  And of course the workaround to bypass the cooldown should be fixed as well.</div>

		<div>re: AoE'ing yourself on AEs that are target-based and not PB... this makes perfect sense (being hit by the blast from your own fireball if you're too close) and I would not be surprised if it were intentional. It's the way it worked in EQ, also, by the way, with pillars, rains, etc there - it was just less noticeable because the ranges were much smaller on those abilities.<br />
<br />
Any and all efforts that go towards making counters work better in PvP make me all happy inside - even though I'm not a sorc this time around, it's something that is really annoying for all the countering classes.</div>

		<div>Yes I would have to agree on that, the time it takes to cast Taq is not equal to the damage at all ( not when you can spam CV and drop them in the time it takes to cast two or three Taqs ).  I still use Taq, but just in areas where I know I may run into a mana shortage or just to mix things up.  If we are going to get a better time on mana shards, then why use Tag at all even in those situations.  With two shards on different cool down timers, Taq would never be used for mana conservation.  <br />
A faster cast time would allow you to use it more often and still have the same amount of time for mana regn, but give you the added time to cast something else that may delay the mob while you get your regn time.<br />
<br />
Woot to any effort in counterspelling in PVP.  this would balance us out so well with other casters that as stated already can heal.  as well as having the wards working correctly.  would have ppl second guessing casting anything on a Sorc in PVP ( at least the first shot to clear the Ward )</div>

		<div>I could actually see the current form of taq with lowered mana cost implemented being useful for grinding in the near future.<br />
<br />
I believe it has been stated before taq has an increase chance to crit. If the increase is really significant, along with the change to our finishers (both a second one, and decreased cost), our best dps/mana ratio combo could be taq + finisher + second finisher. An awesome and deadly combo for killing low-med health mobs. (CV not going to cap out).<br />
<br />
Obviously, for high health mobs CV is going to superior. <br />
<br />
Now going along with what I said, and taking an idea from another post...how about making it so Taq's Barrage upgrade does hit multiple times, and any of the bolts can &quot;crit&quot; triggering our finishers. <br />
<br />
That change along with the lowered mana costs / second finisher would CERTAINLY make taq useful. Especially with a good set of crit gear, and taq's passive crit increase.</div>

I spent some time fighting all father with a powersuit on (uber HP) and used the workaround, cv4 was effectively capped at like 15622, and wouldn't increase in returns past that mark.</div>
