			Abelson: Well, [Python vs. Scheme/Lisp] is all superficial. The main thing is 6.01 is not a course about programming. It&#8217;s not a course about software. It&#8217;s not even a course about computers. The main change was that we said the first course in the department should be a much broader course about what&#8217;s going on in the department. That&#8217;s hard for the programming people to understand.<br />
<br />
6.001 was really a course in software. It&#8217;s how you think about software, how you think about programming. In the new department structure, 6.01 is specifically not that and it&#8217;s not that intentionally. Now, that might or might not have been a good choice, but what we said is, we are going to switch. Before, when you entered the department what you got was a very deep course in thinking about the structure of programming and computer science&#8212;abstraction and modularity.<br />
We said, we are not going to do that anymore. Instead we&#8217;re going to show the breadth of the department. That&#8217;s the basic choice. We&#8217;re going to talk about programming, we&#8217;re going to talk about circuit theory, we&#8217;re going to talk about signal processing, and we&#8217;re going to talk about probabilistic reasoning.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s just a different course. We could have done it in Scheme and I sort of wish we had. And for random reasons we didn&#8217;t. But the thing that ties it together&#8212;if you had fifteen seconds to describe the whole course&#8212;it&#8217;s still about abstraction and modularity. The beginning of that course is not very different from the beginning of 6.001 other than you do it in Python. But at that point, where you&#8217;re not building interpreters yet, you can pretty much do this stuff in Python. You have to contend with Python&#8217;s broken notion of lambda but other than that it&#8217;s not really that different.

		<blockquote class="restore">The SICP book and The Little Schemer books, while being exceptional   texts for CS concepts, were also very useful on groking emacs lisp and   being able to quickly port over some plugins and concepts from VIM that I   was use to.  I think it is freaking cool that an entire other editor  can be implemented on top of a 40 year+ old and evolved platform  utilizing mainly pre-existing lisp functions and it amazingly actually  works and isn't slow at all.  <br />
<br />
That is really impressive IMO,  especially considering that it is all volunteers who made both  platforms.  There is a recent book out that makes a game just using  common lisp, which is funny, but it's common lisp so yeah... that will  be low on the hobby list.  It would have been significantly cooler if  instead clojure was used instead of the much maligned common lisp but  what can you do.<br />
<br />
I always have an emacs session going on my  computer now, even when not writing any programs.  I use it for notes  and brain storming and GTD (org mode), slides (beamer in org), papers,  (latex with auctex, preview, yasnippets, autocomplete which is just  stupifyingly efficient at the task, although the default keybinds feel  like you are playing a fighter game with some of the chording used in  sequence &quot;C-c C-p C-b&quot; in one case) interacting with a version control  system (git in my case).<br />
<br />
Being able to quickly go into an  environment that is proficient for even new languages while being able  to use already learned tools in addition to the new modes is extremely  great.  I can use the same editor for python, haskell, scheme,  octave/matlab, clojure, vhdl, c, and c++ all of which are well done,  especially haskell thanks to the genius of the haskell devs.  The C and  c++ environment is great too if you use clang (a mode can utilize clang  that actually understands your code instead of having to resort to  something like ctags for autocompletion).  Emacs is often overlooked for  those, which is a shame. <br />
<br />
Emac's is an app that will be around  forever and is great at many assorted things, so the investment is  paying off even after only about 4 months or so of usage.  I only wish  there was an easier way to transition into its more advanced usage and  customization however.  Emacs is allegedly poor for java though, so I  use Intellij for that as it was recommended by my friend and people who  use it are high on it while eclipse gets ragged on constantly even by  its own users.  Intellij is open source still though, and respected in  industry.  One advantage Emacs has on the windows platform over VIM is  that it is much nicer due to having a good shell with eshell, while VIM  outside a linux/unix environment does not have as much power (although  it has great synergy with that environment as a toolchain).<br />
<br />
I wish I could use org on my phone but android's the only one which can.  The app for iOS was abandoned (nooo).<br />
<br />
Some  people even use emacs as an email and IM client and news feed (I don't  personally as that seems overly hardcore and obtuse).  One feature that  would be worth paying for someone to finally implement would be  transitioning emacs to a multi-threaded design finally, something that  has been discussed for literally a decade.  Emacs implementing a more  modern lisp would likely improve the amount of interest normal people  have in it as a modern environment, but I am a fan of deprecating  features instead of keeping both a modern and legacy concept around and  improving them like I mentioned in another post.  It's something I  appreciate about Apple's ecosystem is that they are not afraid to retire  support of hardware after only a few years time and abandoning no  longer important features such as dealing wiith dvd/cd drives anymore to  make the devices slimmer and more durable as well.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Oh, I highly recommend using homebrew to get emacs on OS X after trying out both emacs for os x and emacs modified.  The reason I like it is that you can also install auctex through homebrew, and that version is more recent than the ones available through any of the package resources and because it is being install through homebrew updating it is merely a matter of doing &quot;brew update&quot; rather than having to mess with going to a website and hoping it doesn't mess up a config file setting.  One nice thing that emacs for os x had was support for the mouse gestures, at least the swiping ones, so you could swipe through buffers using it, which was pretty convenient even though buffer management is pretty fast on its own.<br />
<br />
Auctex's preview feature was a massive pain in the dick to get working initially due to some weirdness on how OS X handles environment variables in gui applications.  The solution is not hard, but finding it on the net was.  If I had the presence of mind to install from homebrew I would have realized the solution much sooner as it is all mentioned in the print out.  Homebrew has the most up to date version of emacs as well as you can compile from head.  The most recent other emacs packages are only on 24.2.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">After using VIM for about a year or more now and emacs for about 5  months or so, I think emacs, like touch typing, should be a basic life  skill taught in classrooms.  I realize that sounds absurd, but let me  make an argument for why that is the case.<br />
<br />
Programming is  incredibly useful for anyone who is a computer user these days, and  without a doubt it is as essential to being an efficient worker as  communicating well in the lingua franca.  Most programs feature some  kind of scripting available to them, and exploiting the power of the  programs is done through these languages.  In my mind I primarily am  thinking of how impactful Excel is.  Even artists should know how to  program, perhaps especially artists.  Video and photo editors make great  use of such things, and being able to use these features takes the  skill level from basic to masterful.  I think the argument for  programming as a basic life skill is sound for the modern worker.<br />
<br />
So,  why emacs then?  Emacs lisp happens to be the way improving the  platform, and essential for using it well, having a background in  programming helps greatly in this endeavor.  Where emacs is useful for  everyone though is in its value as a GTD method.  Org mode is incredibly  powerful and easy to dive into, and is really a transformational tool  in being efficient.  It is great for brain storming, note taking,  managing tasks and appointments.  It is a selling point for many people  who don't even need the other features of emacs.  Aside from org mode,  emacs makes a fantastic environment for those interested in other  aspects of computing, especially programmers.  Its chief advantage is  how all previous experience is a transferrable skill to any knew  language taken up by the programmer, especially new or esoteric  languages.  From c/c++ (with clang as the compiler) to python, perl, go,  haskell, SML, scheme, common lisp (especially any lisp it is the best  IDE), etc.  You get the point.  Emacs is effective for all but Java  essentially.  It is serviceable for that, but the other options like  Intellij's IDEA are extremely effective and what I use for that.  Emacs  shines when it comes to web design as well due to its genius features  that allow it to communicate with external programs, which leads to  being able to dynamically update the webpage and get a live preview of  the resulting product, making it extremely efficient and potent, and  time is money as experience bears out.<br />
<br />
Emacs is also great for  interfacing with version control systems, which while primarily used by  programmers are useful for everyone who is managing documents or other  texts, such as authors and scientists.  VCS is widely applicable due to  that, comparable to org mode in its wide ranging utility for the common  man.<br />
<br />
Emacs is also a life skill that will pay off.  Emacs has  been around since the creation of the universe, which speaks  exceptionally for its staying power.  Like vi, its legacy will be built  upon until the heat death of the universe.  I am very glad that I took  the time to learn the platform and look forward to becoming even more  masterful in its usage.  It's one of those things that is not only a  fantastic tool, but one that can give an edge over those using less  powerful and efficient tools.  There is a vim koan  (<a href="http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/vim-koans/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/vim-koans/</a>) regarding honing ones skills  instead of being satisfied with being a hard worker instead of a smart  worker, which is the take away from all of this really.<br />
<br />
I must  say that while useful, keeping 3 different enormous environments in my  head is nontrivial.  VIM and emacs are easy due to using evil in emacs  that retains my vim skills through still using it, but intellij is a  different beast, definitely a killer app though and it is both cross  platform and open source, the latter of which is important as it means  that any efforts to improve it will be around for as long as one wishes  and there is no danger of the owner deciding to just kill everything off  or make using those extensions impossible, which recent events like  that of which happened with twitter or people whose app functionality  was effectively killed off by Apple making their own copy a default app.</blockquote>

That's the next language I want to learn.  I will also contend that anyone who feels like Lisp's reduction of syntax via parenthesis nesting is automatically disqualified from evaluating language features.  Why? Any modern editor makes the depth that is currently being edited obvious.  If we were stuck in notepad with no syntax highlighting it would be a different matter.  I'm referring to this: <br />

</div>I don't think Damien knows what he is talking about at all.  The HN discussion is here: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5099861" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5099861</a><br />

Contrast the criticisms by the people in the article with Evan Miller: <a href="http://www.evanmiller.org/why-i-program-in-erlang.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.evanmiller.org/why-i-program-in-erlang.html</a>  He praises the data structure/algorithm implementations that Erlang uses, where as the people in the other article lament it.  I think this is a case of Erlang being substantially different than any other language in use, much like the difference between the ML languages, or Lisp. The HN discussion of the 2nd article is here: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4715823" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4715823d</a><br />
<br />
Further, criticizing a language for its syntax, bizarre or not is strange considering how insignificant the time it takes to absorb the small breadth of syntax programming languages of and how much overlap there is in the concepts such that the jump from one language to another decreases proportional the amount of knowledge already known about the paradigms in a similar language.</blockquote>
