<a href="http://thechurchofentertainmenthedonism.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://thechurchofentertainmenthedonism.bandcamp.com/</a><br />
<br />
My record is up now on bandcamp. Listening / streaming from the site itself is FREE, and downloads may be purchased in multiple formats for just $7 (or more). I made 3 sales yesterday, and I am hoping to beat that today. My goal is to make enough money from the bandcamp site downloads to pay for a limited edition pressing of the record on vinyl, by Christmas.<br />
<br />
If you have been following my musical journey over the last year or so, and have enjoyed my music, I recommend buying the complete record and burning it to disk. Rock n roll just sounds better in the car, or coming through a good stereo.<br />

Thanks for reading!<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote class="blogcontent restore">Tzakapotek Jones was born near the end of the 1960&#8242;s, so he missed out on most of the fun. Very little is known of his early life, though some have speculated that he is in fact, a ‘walk in” from another time or dimension.<br />
<br />
Jones says he spent part of the 70&#8242;s and most of the 80&#8242;s studying with the best Guru’s on Americas West Coast where he dabbled in Scientology, spent a weekend locked in a hotel ballroom with Werner Erhard, and slept through “possibly hundreds” of sermons at the Crystal Cathedral in Orange County, CA.<br />
<br />
Tzakapotek Jones is the founder of the Church of Entertainment Hedonism; a non-religious cult based on the satirization of dead celebrities (also known as “celebritards”) the number “5&#8243; (or “X”) and <i>water</i>. Jones is the author of several works, including “Keys: An Occult History”, “Thee Apokotheria Esoteria”, numerous songs and poems, and the “Dark Faery: Bumblebee” series of children’s books.<br />
<br />
Jones was ordained by the Universal Life Church of Modesto California in 2002, holds a Doctorate in Universal Metaphysics, a Masters Degree in Solar Magick and an Associates Degree in Horticultural Science.  He is currently pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Physics and Philosophy, but progress is slow, as he is a complete slack-ass.<br />
<br />
Tzakapotek Jones writes and advocates for the “New Discordians for World War 5&#8243;, The “John X-Land Died for Your Sins Society” and The Penultimate Group.</blockquote>

It starts small, in a single town, and grows organically. Our credo: If you were "in" before, you are "out" now. Anti-Party has three simple goals.

<br />
It starts small, in a single town, and grows organically. Our credo: If you were &quot;in&quot; before, you are &quot;out&quot; now. Anti-Party has three simple goals.<br />
<br />
1) No soft money or corporate sponsorship of political campaigns, at the local, state or Federal level.<br />
<br />
2) Hard Two-Term limits on every elected office.<br />
<br />
3) Line Item Veto for both State Governors and Presidents.<br />
<br />
Until these goals are reached, through the legislative branches of government, we will focus our energies on defeating incumbency, by supporting the likely upstart candidate in every election. We will ignore the partisans; they are unimportant. All we need is 12-15% of voting independents and we can swing ANY election. <br />
<br />
Your platform means nothing. Your promises, your values, your ideals, your beliefs and your patriotism are irrelevant. We will support the democratic candidate in one town, while supporting the republican in another. Liberal versus conservative, Republican versus Democrat, left versus right, are meaningless diversions, and of no true value or concern until the three objectives are reached.</blockquote>

			<description>I have a mantra I use to stay in a good mood daily, and it’s “always be looking” or “able.” The principal is pretty easy to grasp, even for adults, and I have used it with my kids with great success since last fall.

<br />
The idea is that you try to remain in an “able” state, meaning, you are always looking for a way to help out around the house (especially with mom!). The concept can be further refined, of course. You might always be looking for a solution to a problem, or you might seek to create something. You may decide to satisfy your curiosity, through study of a particular subject, formally or informally.<br />
<br />
The important thing is that you remain in an &quot;able&quot; state of mind. If you struggle with the blues occasionally, you can also watch less TV.<br />
