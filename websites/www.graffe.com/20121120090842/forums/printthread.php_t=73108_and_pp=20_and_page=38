</div>They did remove breadcrumbs in most instances.  People apparently complained about how linear the Cata zones were.  Now you can hop around and do each sub-part in just about any order. <br />
<br />
 I missed one set in the wildlands (whatever the zone south of valley of the four winds is).  I just looked to see what part of my map I hadn't explored and walked into the missing area.  This doesn't help if you explored the whole area, but it is how I narrowed it down.  You might also try WoWHead for whatever piece you are missing.</blockquote>

The 450 chestguard that required honored with Klaxxi - that made perfect sense, since you could start on Klaxxi quests at level 89.</blockquote>

Perhaps they feel that players won't jump right into the tough content?<br />

Speaking of Golden Lotus, where are they? The day I hit 90 I got lucky and managed to score my third one when I was within sight of Halfhill, so I got my trinket. But it looks like damned-near everything I want to do keys off having these things, and they're nowhere to be found. Guess I know what the devs want me to do with all my motes.

</div>I should count up how many motes total I've gained from doing all the quests in Pandaria and over 25 dailies per day since the moment I hit 90. I bet the number is small and sad. I was happy to see that my blacksmith could make blue weapons for my alts as intermediate weapons, but after seeing they had a mote cost I realized I'll never, ever make them. And I'm soooo thrilled that, after the devs took epic gems out of the hands of the casuals last expansion, they've decided to restrict rare quality gems, too.<br />

</div>You get a fair number of VPs from the dailies, too, and you have to do most of them for the rep anyways. I should come close to the weekly cap each week just from doing Anglers, Tillers, Order of the Cloud Serpent, Loremasters, Golden Lotus, and Klaxxi. I don't know how useful these reps will be, given that most of the items on them have associated JP/VP costs and grinding those up is a major pain, but we'll see. I'm tempted to do the Nether Ray Fry/Pengu/Tiny Sporebat trick with the Tiny Goldfish I can now buy off the Angler vendor (buy pet, learn pet, have other alt cage pet for sale, boom - you now have a pet with no rep requirement for customers who don't want to/can't get Anglers rep).<br />
<br />
Note what the common theme is for all of this stuff? Rep grinds that depend on other rep grinds, or where you get much less than the standard 250 rep per quest. Crafted items that require stupidly rare mats (as rare as the original Black Lotus), or a material that requires you to either mass-kill mobs or devote your Tillers farm to them (you can get one mote per plot per day). Basic tradeskill stuff is easy to find, but advanced stuff requires loads of farming, farming you'll need to do to keep up with the discovery-based recipe system that many professions now have. Points rewards (Valor and Justice) nerfed significantly. The next time someone says to the devs &quot;We want more things to do&quot;, could they please make sure they spell out exactly what it is they want to do? Because right now a lot of this is just the same things we did before, but with the rewards significantly slashed so it takes longer.<br />
<br />
And now, a positive note to end the post. I logged onto my Horde DK today to clear her mailbox, so stuff didn't expire. While I was on her I noticed that I could see battle pets in Orgrimmar, so I figured what the hell, let's capture some. Then I noticed that all the battle pet achievements are account-wide. So now I'm a very happy camper, because my Alliance alts never need set foot inside a PvP-flagged area to get all the achievements. I also very quickly realized that my Horde DK will serve a very useful purpose by leveling through the high-70's at the Argent Tourney. It's neat - I can buy a pet on one server, learn it, cage the pet on any other server and on any faction thanks to the magic of Death Knights, sell it there, and use that gold to buy any pet I want for the collection. My buddy was thrilled when I told him about this, since he's always wanted a way to send gold between his main and his alts (he server moved his main ages ago to raid, his nine level 85 alts stayed behind). I wonder how much people on PvP servers would be willing to pay for something like Pengu, where they could skip farming the rep, or the 1500 g Firelands pets?</blockquote>

</div>The drop rate is atrocious, but this is true. For the record, I never saw a Lotus from one of these, and I farmed up enough desecrated herbs to start my Inscriptionist off. (I was also able to buy them cheap on the AH before the other Inscriptionists caught on.)<br />

	</div>
</div>Thank you for pointing this out, because it got me thinking about the grocery quest. The sacks of stuff Nam Ironpaw sells contain either five of a dropped material, or 25 of a farmed material. Depending on what prices are like on your server, there may be an arbitrage advantage to, say, buying 20 Wildfowl Breasts on the AH and turning them into 25 Juicycrunch Carrots for resale. Something for me to investigate when I have time.<br />

	</div>
</div>You can only create three Greater Charms per week. You can only bank ten Greater Charms, period, although you can store up as many Lesser Charms as you have bank space. Doing a full set of dailies for rep you get many more Lesser Charms than you can convert into Greater Charms in a week (for me, right now it's over twice as many). I think people will be able to sit on the Charms they get from getting all the reps to Exalted for a very long time, even if they're using them actively.<br />

Question: does anyone know of an add-on that allows one to copy-paste text in game? Example of what I mean: I see a useful TomTom macro on a website that allows one to set up all spawn points for an item as waypoints. I'd like to be able to copy the text directly from the post and paste it into my macro window. Or if I find a good site that explains something, I'd like to be able to copy the address and paste it into chat to send to a friend. Ideas?</blockquote>

</div>Isn't that the way it is every expansion?  The first good top level weapon you get is from the arena.</blockquote>

For copying text out of game you need a mod. I recommend Prat. <br />

			<div class="message">Question: does anyone know of an add-on that allows one to copy-paste text in game? Example of what I mean: I see a useful TomTom macro on a website that allows one to set up all spawn points for an item as waypoints. I'd like to be able to copy the text directly from the post and paste it into my macro window. Or if I find a good site that explains something, I'd like to be able to copy the address and paste it into chat to send to a friend. Ideas?</div>
