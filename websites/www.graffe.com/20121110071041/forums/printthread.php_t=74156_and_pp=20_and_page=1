Maybe I am just getting Senile in my old age (all of 44), but isn't overhauling Medicare a core goal of the GOP?  Well Medicare, Social Security, and other entitlement programs.  <br />
<br />
Some of the stuff I have read indicates the cost to Seniors goes up under Ryans plan.  I guess the arguement is that today's Seniors will see no change in their entitlement, but the anyone else better be ready to work for another decade.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">As I understand it, Ryan's plan grandfathers in everyone currently 55 and over. Benefits and cost don't change for anyone in that group.<br />
<br />
For everyone else, the straight coverage is replaced with a credit that they can use to purchase insurance, either with Medicare or with a private company. The caveat is the credit will not scale the way Medicare currently does or with how health insurance costs have historically risen, leaving people to pay a difference that will steadily increase over time. This is how the plan saves money.<br />
<br />
The <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-said-president-obama-funneled-716-billio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Republicans' reasoning</u></a> for how Obamacare will destroy Medicare is a &quot;cut&quot; of $716b. This money is primarily saved by the elimination of Medicare Advantage, which is a government subsidy provided to private insurers that was intended to reduce costs by fostering competition. It hasn't worked, and the money Obamacare is &quot;cutting&quot; is also part of Ryan's Path to Prosperity plan, a fact he conveniently forgets to mention.<br />
<br />
Neither side is faultless on this front. There's a reason why FactCheck has <a href="http://factcheck.org/2012/08/a-campaign-full-of-mediscare/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>called out both sides</u></a> on trying to use &quot;Mediscare&quot; on the stump.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Ryan's plan ties the vouchers with GDP.  However healthcare costs have risen at something like 4x the rate of GDP over the last 20 years.  So at the start, Ryan's plan would not make much difference aside making private business profit.  However anyone using it would quickly find themselves in a position of it only covering part of their costs.  And that percent would decrease over time as health care costs quickly out paced the voucher payout.<br />
<br />
And that's the best case scenario from what I can tell.  Worst case is that private companies, looking increase profits, don't offer the same coverage medicare does.  Basically these policies don't exist yet, so it's assumption.  But the odds of you getting equal coverage from private insurers for the amount of money the government currently spends (and you'd get in voucher form) is fairly low.  Odds are that a majority of people on medicare would be forced into less coverage because they couldn't afford more.<br />
<br />
The bottom line being that within 10 years of Ryan's plan going into effect the Republicans would be shouting at how medicare is worthless because it barely covers any costs and it should be abolished as a government policy.  After all, wouldn't you be better off if your taxes were lowered from not having to pay into medicare anymore?  It's not even covering your costs anymore.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Also, the Ryan plan puts the doughnut hole back in place for current seniors, costing millions to seniors.<br />
<br />
Part of the cuts in Obama's ACA come in spending rate reductions by hospitals because they will have a larger pool of insured people, so less patient bills that never get paid and are absorbed elsewhere.  There are no additional cost to seniors, and the ACA gives 6 more years of life to Medicare without costing the taxpayers any more. <br />
<br />
Why we don't have UHC is beyond me.  We pay twice as much per capita of the most expensive UHC system, Canada, and we have 50+ Million uninsured.  With our population around 300 million, that mean that 1 in 6 people aren't covered, so everyone's cost go up so that hospitals can cover for the fact that 1/6 people who come through their door wont be paying for their services.  Would any industry stay in business long with odds like that?  or would they just make it so expensive to cover those costs.  Go to an emergency room on any given night.  Count how many people wont be paying.  Then think about how many of them wouldn't be there at all if they had proper preventative care.  Which cost more?  More people die every year in this country because they don't have proper health insurance than we lost in during the entire wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and 911 combined.  Wrap your head around that next time the Republicans say they want to privatize SSI and Medicare.</blockquote>
