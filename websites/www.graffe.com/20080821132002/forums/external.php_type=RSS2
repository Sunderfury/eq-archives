The stage has 4 banks of lights than can be lowered onto the stage.  3 sets are LED screens and one set are LED lights in a moveable spotlight configuration.  With the LED screens lowered, its able to create a 3-D environment.  One scene had the band playing an instrumental in the desert.  If you get the chance and enjoy NIN, do yourself a favor and see this awesome show.  He also played for over 2 hours tonight so he really brought it.  Money well spent.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I recently went to get a visa for mainland China and was given a special surprise.<br />
<br />
After just 4 days of processing time (it's usually 2 months) I got a very peculiar visa for China. Although I didn't have a valid Chinese visa at the time, they regarded the new visa as &quot;redundant&quot;, in that while they added a new visa, it is affixed with the note, &quot;Refer to other Chinese visa.&quot; Which other Chinese visa!?<br />
<br />
The Taiwan visa, apparently! This comes with a slight perk, too - instead of getting some lousy 30 or 90 day single-entry visa or something, I have an Everlasting Visa.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what to make of it. Is this the bizarre logical conclusion of the One China Policy?</div>

				The Labor Department reported Tuesday that wholesale prices shot up 1.2 percent in July, pushed higher by rising costs for energy and a variety of other products from motor vehicles to plastic goods.<br />
<br />
The increase was more than twice the 0.5 percent gain that economists expected and left prices rising over the past 12 months by 9.8 percent. That marked the biggest annual increase since the 12 months ending in June 1981, a period when the Federal Reserve was driving interest rates to the highest levels since the 1861-1865 U.S. Civil War in an effort to combat a decade-long bout of inflation.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I am finding that I feel better and am more motivated to do job search related activities if I am outside of my home.  I suspect this is because home is &quot;the goofing off place&quot; and not the &quot;work place.&quot;  There is a Slutbucks very near our apartment, and since we have top tier AT&amp;T DSL, we get free AT&amp;T WiFi there (I'm actually writing this while sitting in Slutbucks).  However, one can only go to Slutbucks so many times, before it starts to wear on you.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for suggestions for places to go to get out of the house and hopefully get something productive done.  Obviously, depending on what I am doing, access to wifi is preferred/required, which is one limiting factor I am finding in my quest for a productive place.<br />
<br />
Also, I would like to take this opportunity to point out that looking for a job sucks major donkey balls.  No, strike that, it sucks more than that.  Whatever is worse than sucking major donkey balls, job hunting is that.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I liked this one on okcupid, thanks to Dmitry for introducing me to this site through the Brutally Honest Personality Test!<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.helloquizzy.com/results/the-perception-personality-image-test/?fromCGI=1&amp;var_HumanityToNature=0&amp;var_BackgroundToForeground=1&amp;var_DetailsToBigPicture=3&amp;var_ColorToShape=4" target="_blank">http://www.helloquizzy.com/results/t...ColorToShape=4</a><br />
<br />
The above was my result from the test, the idea for this one is that you get a set of pictures to look at and then you respond to what you were most and least drawn to on it. The first couple pictures didn't quite work for me, but after that I liked the test. I would have preferred if there were &quot;the light&quot; and &quot;the dark&quot; on some of the answer options, as I often consider contrast zones rather than explicit objects in a scene.<br />
<br />
Fun anyway!</div>
