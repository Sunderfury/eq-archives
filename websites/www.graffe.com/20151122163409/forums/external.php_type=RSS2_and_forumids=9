<br />
What I do does NOT FUCKING TRANSLATE into skills that apparently every homeowner must possess.<br />
<br />
I can find the weakness in any network system on the planet (find, mind you, I'm not capable of exploiting all of them) in a matter of hours, but I CANNOT FIND THE GODDAMNED ALUMINUM CLIPS TO REMOVE THE LOWER HOOD ON MY WHIRLPOOL DRIER.<br />
<br />
Two hours with screwdrivers and socket wrenches and flashlights and I can MOSTLY access the drum on the fucker, but I can't pull it completely apart so I can inspect it.<br />
<br />
I HATE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY A CLOTHES DRIER.<br />
<br />
WHY DOES &quot;BEING A GROWN UP&quot; COME WITH SO MANY LINE ITEMS?<br />
<br />
FUUUUUUUUUUCK.<br />
<br />
I wish my HOA didn't have a rule against clotheslines, because I'd hang that shit out until it started sleeting (and it looks to be a mild winter).<br />
<br />
It's the last appliance in the house to have a major issue (everything else has been replaced) but it's ridiculous how necessary a clothes drier is.<br />
<br />
We had a busted toilet (the only one in the house) and got through it.<br />
<br />
We had a busted water heater and got through it.<br />
<br />
We had a busted refrigerator/freezer and got through it.<br />
<br />
We had a busted washer (clothes) and got through it by washing shit in the bathtub BECAUSE WE COULD THROW IT IN THE DRIER AFTERWARDS.<br />
<br />
I've been hanging shit up to dry in the basement and steam ironing it in the bathroom before going to work in the morning for over a week now.<br />
<br />
My wife said &quot;fuck this&quot; some time ago and bundles her laundry in the car, with the kid, and treks all the way to her parent's house so she can have clean bras.<br />
<br />
It's probably a belt busted somewhere in the drier.<br />
<br />
Or maybe a motor issue.<br />
<br />
Or the felt that insulates the drum from moving.<br />
<br />
Or SOMETHING.<br />
<br />
BUT I CAN'T TELL BECAUSE I KNOW JACK FUCK ALL ABOUT APPLIANCE REPAIR AND THE TECHNICIANS CHARGE AN ARM AND A LEG TO EVEN *LOOK* AT IT.<br />
<br />
Where's my goddamned &quot;adult&quot; manual?<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I am so angry with the world i could scream all day long....i have a 3 year old child with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a muscle wasting condition which means he will permamnently be in a wheelchair by 10 and die somewhere between teens and mid twenties having spent all of his life strugling to walk move and later to breathe. am on forum for families with this horrific condition but everyone in same boat dont want to always be moaning. Spend my days looking into his gorgeous big brown eyes knowing his future and planting a smile on my face when all i want to do is scream an cry pick him up and run and run and run.......<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>It was the 16th of October when I read a post from a buddy of mine on facebook with pictures of a dude which looked familiar to me. I read the text sort of jumbled, and the pictures were all taken in at the same time as I read the words, &quot;passed away&quot; and tried to make it form right in my head. <br />
<br />
I remember the pause when I realized that John had died, and the sudden urge to find out what happened. <br />
<br />
Today, the members of the final iteration of the Rocky Horror picture show came together and performed the songs which John played the roll of Eddie and Dr. Scott in his memorial, and really blew the roof off the place. The keyboardist got a bass player and a drummer together in order to put it in. I grabbed my horn and picked it up for the first time in 2 years. Felt as familiar as a finger in my nose. <br />
<br />
I get really frustrated when stuff like this happens. I feel like I didn't reach out enough, and because I tapered off at the end by not participating. By getting distracted by my own things in life, I wasn't there enough to catch something like this. I feel like I could have been part of the reason he wouldn't have done this. But then I heard from so many people who felt exactly the same. Like their conversation was so recent with him, they feel almost like they were part of it. Or could have been there to stop it. <br />
<br />
I talked to the same buddy of mine who said me up to speed with all of this who said that he was always planning to take himself out before he was feeble. And unfortunately, he was getting there. Slowly, but surely. And even though no one else thought so, he thought even more so than anyone else. <br />
<br />
All i'm going to say here is, if you ever have a chance to see Avenue Q,  the Rocky Horror Picture show, Hamlet has No Legs (or any of the Has No Legs) productions. See them. The Has No Legs productions are primarily out of phoenix now, but they're fantastic.</div>
