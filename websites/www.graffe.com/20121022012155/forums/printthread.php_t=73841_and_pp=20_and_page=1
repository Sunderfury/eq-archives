<br />
I have no evidence that they actually did anything on the server.<br />
<br />
The exploit they used was with a flawed version of vBulletin which we have since patched (unfortunately I don't keep logs of when I complete upgrades, so I'm not sure how long we were vulnerable).<br />
<br />
<br />
They had permissions to create additional files, but not update, overwrite, or delete files.  This means that I have a copy of any file they created, and I haven't found a single file that appears to have enabled them to access the database.  The files they would have had access to are all attachments, as well as the configuration for Graffes.  Private Messages, Posts, Usernames and Passwords are not contained in files, they are contained in the database.<br />
<br />
<br />
In spite of my belief that only the Graffe.com passwords have been compromised, please update your passwords anywhere you used the same password as on Graffe.com, and recognize that <br />
<br />
<br />
I apologize for the horrible failure on my part, and I'll try to clarify any questions in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?73841-Nadiar-Fucked-Up&amp;p=1749510#post1749510&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.</div>

Ugh, I feel mildly sick now.  Researching additional information.<br />
<br />
The backdoor they installed was Locus7shell.</blockquote>
