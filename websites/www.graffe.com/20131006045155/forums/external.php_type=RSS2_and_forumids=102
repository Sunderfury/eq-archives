<br />
If I am Wolfram or Mathworks I am increasingly uncomfortable about my capacity to be relevant and very concerned. IPython (with supporting libraries) is already very good and replicates a large swathe of Mathematica's and Matlab's functionality. And, recently IPython gained interop with Julia (a numerical computing language like Octave/Matlab), which is gaining traction amongst engineers despite being relatively immature and it is extremely promising and incomparably better designed than Matlab (the PL) already (not that that is hard to do). So, it's nice to see MS providing some grant money for further IPython work as it's already an important and very useful bit of technology that keeps getting better. <br />
<br />
Mathematica has less overlap with current IPython features than Matlab though as excluding Mathematica's very nice document export functions, I am not aware of a way to embed an interactive demo within an IPython notebook like one can with Mathematica which is immensely useful in some demo situations. But, there may be a way to do that as easily, and I am just not aware of it. Google did not turn anything up though. Assuming that assertion is correct, I would be surprised if it did not make its way into IPython in the future as IPython is already in use by instructors who could take advantage of such a feature.</div>

To clarify, does any know of an IDE/Language/tool that allows someone to view a program's entire state at time t(0) + 1 and then alter the state such that the program state is the same as it was at time t(0)? Even more ideally, if the program crashes everything about the program's state is saved such that one can see what the program's state was that cause before it crashed. Even more ideally, I could patch the running program without restarting it.</div>

Most plans now have unlimited talk and text for the same amount. I'd like to upgrade to a smartphone.<br />
<br />
Sadly, they all seem to be loaded with bloatware and don't function nearly as well as my Nexus 7. I'd like to find an android phone I can enjoy as much as my tablet, but I'm not sure what my expectation for performance should be if the &quot;openness&quot; of the phone is in question.<br />
<br />
Any tips for finding a good android smartphone? I don't plan on heavy use, but having something slightly more portable than the tablet for text information would be nice.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I recently got a Logitech Wireless headset/microphone to use to make some training videos.  Windows 7 installed it fine and it works.  However, it disabled my speakers when it installed and now the only way to get the speakers to work is by uninstalling the headset.  I only use the headset a couple times a week, but that's a pain to have to uninstall/reinstall it all the time.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to make them work together somehow?  I've looked on Logitech's site and done some Googling, but can't come up with anyone having the same problem.  Is there something I can do to troubleshoot the problem?  Could there be a port conflict or something?</div>

<br />
If you are familiar with the LLVM project, the idea is similar except for a language abstraction for code analysis/tool development. Instead of having to write both the backend to the compiler and the front end for interacting with it for each platform (OS &amp; architecture) and how it is interacted with for every ecosystem, separate those via an intermediate language. The result is an order's of magnitude deduplication of efforts for the tools themselves and every language does not have different levels of maturity for code analysis.<br />

  Each IDE becomes a &quot;thin&quot; client. Every IDE supports M languages out of the box.<br />
  <i>Side benefits:</i> Eclipse will start faster (less tooling support needed). Consistency across cross-language calls. <br />
  Crucially, consistent tools make it easier to switch languages. Devs  would then be more likely to use the best language for the job. IDE  authors can focus on presentation and editing. This leads to more  configurability, scriptability, accessibility in languages.</div>

</div>This is by far the most interesting project being worked on in computing since the genome project to me, and it will make transferring between languages much nicer as there will be greater homogeneity with how its tools are interacted with and how much intelligence I can expect with them. I really wish that Google would make it available so that people outside Google could work on it, hopefully they will eventually and this does not become another killed project. <br />
<br />
Consider how documentation is created within source code is not consistent between languages, as a result multiple semantics have to be kept in mind if you interact with ones that do not use the same ones. Haskell uses Haddock and C (and others) uses Doxygen for instance. It's madness and wastes valuable man hours.<br />
<br />
As an example, if this project is successful one could change between Java and Rust with no parity in toolchain maturity once the backend for Rust with Grok was implemented, and the toolchain available to interact with a language is at least (and to me a lot more important) than the language itself when deciding what to use for a task. <br />
<br />
It has important implications for refactoring and automatic and intelligent code updating as well, which would be a huge boon for working with very old code base with non-static language standards or just changing &quot;rules&quot; for the project's code, such as if you have a person that is militant about 80 char width lines or an angry e-mail/desk visit will ensue. Even keeping formatting consistent is not something that is consistent across languages when there should really be a one tool to rule them all to do so that understands the code itself. Gofmt is an example of such a tool but it is specific to Go. Quickcheck is another example; that is of huge benefit but is most well done in Haskell, a tool which would benefit everyone.</div>

<br />
A common convention in Rails is to map out configurations into yaml files based on what your environment your in.  I am currently looking at a configuration that is something along the following lines.<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Code:</div>
	<hr /><code class="bbcode_code">BackgroundJobs: &amp;jobs<br />
&nbsp;  JobOne:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data_store: &quot;database.primary&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; priority: &quot;high&quot;<br />
&nbsp;  JobTwo:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data_store: &quot;database.primary&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; priority: &quot;medium&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev:<br />
&nbsp;  &lt;&lt;: *jobs<br />
<br />
Test:<br />
&nbsp;  &lt;&lt;: *jobs</code><hr />
</div>Now, the catch is I'd like to be able to specify a different priority in test for job two.  I tried something straight forward:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Code:</div>
	<hr /><code class="bbcode_code">BackgroundJobs: &amp;jobs<br />
&nbsp;  JobOne:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data_store: &quot;database.primary&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; priority: &quot;high&quot;<br />
&nbsp;  JobTwo:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data_store: &quot;database.primary&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; priority: &quot;medium&quot;<br />
<br />
Dev:<br />
&nbsp;  &lt;&lt;: *jobs<br />
<br />
Test:<br />
&nbsp;  &lt;&lt;: *jobs<br />
&nbsp;  JobTwo:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; priority: &quot;high&quot;</code><hr />
</div>But this just overwrites JobTwo entirely for test and I lose the data_store attribute.  The actual configurations for the jobs are large enough that I would like to avoid having to repeat the entire configuration just to change one attribute.  Likewise, there are enough jobs that I'd like to avoid flooding Dev and Test with a bunch of &quot;&lt;&lt;* jobConfiguration[X]&quot; stuff.  Anyone with any ideas how I can accomplish this?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Has anyone else used TuneUp?<br />
<br />
Basically, when the iPod classic first came out, a good friend of mine got one as a christmas gift - back when they were around the $200+ price range. I thought such an investment for an mp3 player was ridiculous, I think I'd purchased one or two of those simple USB Memory sticks with a play button and a couple other controls on it for ~$20. At the time, I thought it was all that was necessary, weighing an ability to recharge and not having to change batteries manually as amenities that just weren't worth it.<br />
<br />
However, I was quite amazed at the iTunes ability to sort and categorize different mp3 naming norms. Beastie_Boys-Intergalactic and Beastie Boys - Intergalactic were placed into similar directories, and mp3s were organized rather well. <br />
<br />
I decided to buy an iPod classic of my own about 3 years ago. I was not impressed with so many redundant directories, so I did some searching and discovered TuneUp. I still wasn't especially impressed, but I decided to purchase the program with a lifetime version and was quite satisfied with the results. THey were slow, but it was still easier than going through 40 or 50 gigs of mp3s myself. I also liked that it could play videos, at the time. The iPad had not yet really made a reason to spend so much money as a video player, to me, and I figured it would be a passing fad. <br />
<br />
Day in and Day out, my hard-labor based job went by so much easier with some headphones and a charged iPod. I Loved how long the battery lasted, but still, I had the same problem from the get go - so many duplicate and redundant entries. I was too lazy to really sit down with the TUneUp program. <br />
<br />
NOW, finally, the TuneUp program has a single button for doing all of the 3 features (delete redundant files, grab correct file information, analyze sound against a song database) and am very impressed. It still is nowhere near perfect, but the purchase price of $30 3 years ago has continued to appreciate. <br />
<br />
What is the best program on the market that does this? I&quot;ll go ahead and put it out there that I have mp3s from years of collection back during the napster era that total a tremendous amount more than what I've purchased over iTunes. <br />
<br />
I would use my phone as my mp3 device, but it really is a waste of space, in my opinion - photos, video, and general app data is so much worth while in the big picture, and Pandora is more than adequate for when i want to listen to new music through my headphones. <br />
<br />
Any recommendations for an alternative?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've been using DTrace some lately, and it has absolutely blown me away in its intelligence and utility. <br />
<br />
It is like I have unlocked a way to communicate directly with and grok the Matrix, and is a game changing utility for debugging and profiling software on par with Valgrind in its game changing usefulness. <br />
<br />
The need for using print statements or debugging flags is a thing of the past and it is a joy to use.<br />
<br />
The big time bonus is that unlike Valgrind, DTrace is useful in every language and can be used provided someone takes the time to add bindings to DTrace within that language, so it exists for Java, all the C families, etc.<br />
<br />
As an example, such exists for Erlang despite neither Sun or Oracle originally targeting that and while abandoned now a modest attempt exists for Haskell (notably this would be very useful to complete as Haskell is constantly blamed for having shitty debugging tools).<br />
<br />
It was originally a Solaris only utility, but it has been ported to FreeBSD, QNX, OS X (with some slight gimping because Apple is a soup nazi and hate fun), and for the most part by Oracle to their own non-free version of Linux.  <br />
<br />
For licensing reasons including this in the Linux kernel directly allegedly would be incompatible with the open source license that Sun (or was it Oracle) released Solaris and its userland tools like DTrace too, so for that reason Linux has something similar but not as great in the form of SystemTap.  <br />
<br />
However, here is the interesting bit. Despite the shackles would be licenses and patents would place on implementing DTrace in Linux, one can do so in a 1:1 way without violating the various mechanisms Oracle has placed upon the software through some trickery about how it is loaded. A work in progress of DTrace on Linux that will allow usage of it outside of Oracle's Linux distro is here: <a href="https://github.com/dtrace4linux/linux" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/dtrace4linux/linux</a><br />
<br />
Now, I say all of that to ask this: DTrace is an amazing bit of software, and it is game changing at all levels of programming and pretty much all languages; however, despite this instead of throwing significant weight behind fully realizing DTrace on Linux through helping out the developer working towards having it fully ported over for usage with all other Linux distros work continues to focus on the less useful, less performant SytemTap. <br />
<br />
While SystemTap has a nicer license for libre software enthusiasts, a large swathe of Linux users and Linux using companies give zero fucks about such things and are happy to utilize all possible software based on its technical merits alone, and there are a lot of corporations which pay for developers to work on the Linux kernel for things they need, which is awesome and everything but it is a means to an end rather than a philosophical bent for them.<br />
<br />
The question is, why does Red Hat and others continue to work on SystemTap rather than reaching parity with DTrace on Linux? The one advantage something other than DTrace could have is not using a new programming language specific to the tool and only used for Solaris derived tools (it is called D but it's not the same as the D language that Walter Bright created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28disambiguation%29#Computing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_%28d...n%29#Computing</a>), but other than that everything is gravy.<br />
<br />
I would like to see an embedded DSL in Python or some other wide spread language used for it instead of having to grok yet-another-language to utilize yet-another-tool. D is not hard, I just try to be as lazy as possible and avoid relearning the same functions over and over, which is why I largely trend towards cross platform (and ideally open source) tools as much as possible regardless of their initial time cost. Plus keeping yet-another-language in my head is an obnoxious redundancy that I would like to eliminate.<br />
<br />
I also wish ZFS (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS</a>) would be more widely used, especially that Apple would switch to it over their own proprietary and less well designed FS. ZFS makes a lot of really brilliant decisions is why I would like this and HFS+ is about as awesome as Windows 3.1 in comparison. Interestingly they had a WIP version of this but abandoned it for no apparent reason, possibly they got in a dick measuring match with Oracle over it though, who knows with them.<br />
<br />
Basically, Solaris has/had some really cool shit in it despite its relatively short lived hoorah and is another example of technical merit being insufficient for market relevance in IT, aggressively stealing that cool shit so it can be used across multiple platforms for great justice would be stellar. <br />
<br />
In my ideal universe where I am a billionaire pilanthropist I would buy Nuance, Hex-Ray, Lispworks, Vitanuova, and Oracle and make Lispworks' IDE, ARM, IDA Pro (nothing like this exists outside of Hex Ray that is as expansive in scope afaik), Solaris and its associated tools like DTrace, Dragon Naturally Speaking, and Inferno OS available under a libre license and push Plan 9/Inferno OS like mad as it is brilliantly executed and takes the UNIX paradigm of composable tools with an everything is a file concept to its logical conclusion. Alas I do not have magical fantasy to reality instantaneous dust, but those technologies are fucking sweet.</div>

It is sad that the battery on my laptop last longer than Android, Firefox OS, or iOS smart phones now. In particular, I would like a smart phone that had 24+ hours of battery life, was comfortable to hold (the iPhone 5 is basically a razor blade with how thin it is and its small width), had an excellent camera, and focused on privacy and security as its #1 focus similar to how OpenBSD is ran with a much more nuanced privilege model than what Android or iOS has, and used open hardware.  On OpenBSD I have a lot of control over what privileges an application has; there's no reason that should not be on par to that elsewhere in the world. The battery life and security focus is the main concern though.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>For the past couple of months, I've had an issue on my home desktop.  Whenever I click an icon to launch something, or double-click to open a file, the focus does not go to that window.  The program launches and just flashes on the task bar until I Alt-Tab over to it.  This is Win7 x64 Ultimate Edition<br />
<br />
I've Google'd the problem and everything I've seen so far says to change a registry setting regarding window foreground timeout, but that did not help.<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced this problem?  How did you fix it?</div>
