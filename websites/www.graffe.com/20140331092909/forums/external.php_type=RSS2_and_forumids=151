			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>About 2 hours ago from time of posting, graffe.com was being hit by a lot of connections simultaneously.  Not sure if it was directed at us, or was directed at the network we're on (Linode.  Which I think is much more likely).

No evidence that any exploits were found and used.</div>
