			German Chancellor Angela Merkel has cleared the way for the prosecution of German comedian Jan Böhmermann, whose poem mocking Turkey's president has become the centerpiece of a clash between Germany's free-speech traditions and the government's efforts to safeguard its important relations with Turkey.<br />
<br />
In a press conference Friday, Merkel emphasized that it will now be up to German courts to decide whether Böhmermann is guilty of insulting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.<br />
<br />
&quot;In a country under the rule of law it is not up to the government to decide,&quot; Merkel said. &quot;Prosecutors and courts should weight personal rights against the freedom of press and art.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although Böhmermann could face several years in jail if convicted, lawyers familiar with similar cases expect that the comedian would have to pay a fine, if at all.<br />
<br />
The stakes are potentially higher for Merkel.<br />
<br />
Criticism of her reaction to the incident had mounted ahead of the announcement. Opponents have said the chancellor made a glaring misstep earlier by calling the poem &quot;deliberately offending&quot; — a comment interpreted by some as support for Erdogan who has been accused of cracking down on press freedom in Turkey.<br />
<br />
Not allowing the charges to proceed could have jeopardized a refugee deal with Turkey, which was recently negotiated. Turkish officials had publicly pressured Merkel to allow the charges. Earlier this week, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said that the poem was an insult against all Turks.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is why the Republic of Turkey demands that this impertinent man is immediately punished for insulting a president, within the scope of German law,&quot; Kurtulmus said. He went on to call the poem a &quot;serious crime against humanity&quot; that had &quot;crossed all lines of indecency.&quot;<br />
<br />
In her statement Friday, Merkel tried to appease critics by announcing that she would seek to repeal the controversial German law against insulting heads of state.<br />
<br />
Merkel was forced to decide on the matter after the Turkish president had officially filed charges against Böhmermann at the beginning of this week.<br />
<br />
The mock poem in question aired during a segment of ZDF Television's Neo Magazin Royale show last week. Some of the lines included accusations of bestiality and other unsavory things.

I mentioned this concept to my family, and now - a good while later - they're suddenly hell-bent on trying it.<br />

		<hr />
		
			As Republicans in Congress push legislation that would gut the Federal Communications Commission's authority to enforce net neutrality rules, the White House today issued a policy statement threatening a veto.<br />
<br />
&quot;If the president were presented with H.R. 2666 [the bill number] his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill,&quot; the statement said.<br />
<br />
The bill is titled the No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act and was approved by the Energy and Commerce Committee over objections from Democrats last month. The bill would strip the FCC of authority to set broadband rates or review whether a rate is reasonable, and it's controversial mainly because it defines &quot;rate regulation&quot; so broadly that it could prevent the FCC from enforcing net neutrality rules against blocking and throttling. It could also limit the FCC's authority to prevent ISPs from applying data caps in discriminatory ways.<br />
<br />
The House Rules Committee voted yesterday to send the bill to the House floor this week for votes on Democratic amendments designed to preserve FCC authority, Politico reported.<br />
<br />
Even if it passes the House and Senate, the rate regulation proposal isn't likely to become law because of the president's veto power. From telephone service to broadband access, US laws for nearly a century have prevented communications companies from exploiting gatekeeper power, the White House policy statement said. But this bill &quot;would undermine key provisions&quot; in the net neutrality order that prevent abuses, it said.<br />
<br />
The bill would &quot;restrict the FCC's ability to take enforcement actions to protect consumers on issues where the FCC has received numerous consumer complaints... hamstring the FCC's public interest authority to review transactions... [and] limit the Commission's ability to address new practices and adapt its rules for a dynamic, fast-changing online marketplace,&quot; the White House said.<br />
<br />
Republicans argue that even the &quot;potential&quot; of rate regulation &quot;discourages investment and unique pricing structures or service plans.&quot; Verizon, meanwhile, just decided to expand its FiOS fiber construction for the first time in several years, bolstering FCC Chairman Wheeler's contention that the passage of net neutrality rules last year hasn't harmed network investment.<br />
<br />
Dozens of advocacy groups wrote to House leaders in both parties on Tuesday urging them to reject the bill.<br />
<br />
Separately, Republican lawmakers held a hearing Wednesday on a bill that would cut the budget of an FCC program that helps poor people buy phone and Internet service.

			Fort Worth, Texas  • A judge on Wednesday ordered a Texas teenager who used an &quot;affluenza&quot; defense in a fatal drunken-driving wreck to serve nearly two years in jail, a surprising sanction that far exceeds the several months in jail that prosecutors initially said they would pursue.<br />
<br />
Ethan Couch, who was appearing in adult court for the first time after he turned 19 on Monday, received 180 days for each of the four deaths in the June 2013 crash.<br />
<br />
Initially, state District Judge Wayne Salvant said he would not immediately rule on how much longer Couch, already in custody since he was arrested in Mexico last year, would spend in the Tarrant County Jail. But he reconsidered his ruling after prosecutors convinced him that Couch should be sentenced not to 120 days in jail for the crash, but to 180 days for each of four counts of intoxication manslaughter under a separate part of Texas code.<br />
<br />
Couch had always faced the prospect of adult jail time as part of his probation once his case had moved out of the juvenile system. Prosecutors didn't ask the judge to declare Couch had violated his juvenile probation by fleeing to Mexico with his mother, or to consider it in his ruling.<br />
<br />
Each 180-day term will be served consecutively, Salvant ordered. Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson said Wednesday that it was not clear if that would include the time Couch has already spent in jail.<br />
<br />
Prosecutors declined to comment afterward on their strategy, citing a gag order Salvant has issued in the case. For months, they had indicated they wouldn't be able to get more than a few months in jail for Couch, though they said he might face decades in prison if he violated his probation as an adult.<br />
<br />
But as the hearing Wednesday neared an end, prosecutors said they wanted Salvant to consider a section under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure that allows a judge to give a defendant facing probation for a felony crime up to 180 days. Prosecutors asked Salvant to issue a &quot;stacked&quot; sentence, running each of the four punishments consecutively.<br />
<br />
Salvant agreed over the objections of Reagan Wynn, one of Couch's attorneys. But he said he would give both sides two weeks to file any response to his sentence, suggesting that he might reconsider.<br />
<br />
The initial sentence of 10 years of probation that Couch received in juvenile court outraged prosecutors and relatives of the victims, which include one teenager who was paralyzed and uses a wheelchair.<br />
<br />
The new jail time surprised Greg Coontz, a lawyer who represented one person killed in the crash and another who was injured. Coontz said it was good news that Couch received more punishment, but he questioned whether it was enough to rehabilitate Couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;In some ways, it's kind of ironic that at this point he gets so much more time than he did initially,&quot; Coontz said. &quot;It almost seems like it worked backward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Couch lost control of his family's pickup truck after he and his friends had played beer pong and drank beer that some of them had stolen from a Wal-Mart. He veered into a crowd of people helping the driver of a disabled vehicle on the side of the road. Authorities later estimated that he was going 70 mph in a 40 mph zone.<br />
<br />
The crash fatally injured the stranded motorist, a youth minister who stopped to help her and a mother and daughter who came out of their nearby home.<br />
<br />
Couch was found to have had a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit for adult drivers.<br />
<br />
Couch ended up in trouble again last year after a cellphone video showed him at what appeared to be a party with alcohol. Drinking alcohol is a violation of Couch's probation. Shortly after the video surfaced, Couch and his mother, Tonya, fled to Mexico.<br />
<br />
The two were apprehended in a Mexican resort city in December and sent back to the United States. Couch has been in custody since.<br />
<br />
It was not Couch's first run-in with the law. At 15, Couch was given two citations after a police officer found him behind the wheel of a pickup truck next to a half-naked girl, with an open vodka bottle on the backseat floor.<br />
<br />
Ethan's father, Fred, runs a roofing and construction company and has faced lawsuits over a $100,000 debt and allegations of sexual harassment. Tonya Couch is charged with hindering the apprehension of a felon for helping Ethan flee to Mexico.<br />
<br />
Miller, the psychologist who suggested Couch had &quot;affluenza,&quot; blamed Couch's parents at his sentencing for having &quot;taught him a system that's 180 degrees from rational. If you hurt someone, say you're sorry. In that family, if you hurt someone, send some money.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fred Couch attended Wednesday's hearing. He did not respond to questions as he left the courthouse.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have been a bad computer person.  My last PC builds were in December 2005 and January 2006.  These were Vista machines that were shortly updated to 7 and now to Win10.  They are old, loud, and having various issues at this point.<br />
<br />
My issue is that I've been out of the loop so long I am not sure what to look for anymore.  I don't need an ultra high-end system, but I'm not at a point where I have to do a PC on a budget.  I would be looking at 2 (for me and for wife).  I am certainly looking at quiet being very high on my list of things I am looking for.  I don't see us upgrading on a 2-3 year cycle ever again, so I want something good enough I don't have to jack with it for a while outside of maybe a harddrive or ram.  My wife doesn't get beyond WoW, so we aren't talking a monster for requirements (our current machines don't actually hit minimum for next WoW release).  I've got various Steam games at this point that don't really run on my machine (FF13 games specifically, but sure there are others and will be in the coming future)<br />
<br />
I have hit various build sites to see what is going on.  I seem to be pushing close to $3k which just doesn't seem right.  I am obviously over killing in some areas.<br />
<br />
Could the more knowledgeable types see below for general guidance?  I would probably post more specifics as I get closer to an actual build, but for now I am just a bit over my head as far as knowing what I need to look for.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Processor:  I am assuming I need/want i7 something.  I see up to 4.0 gHz, but not sure if that is needed.<br />
<br />
Motherboard:  not a clue where to start here.  Each build site seems to have their own set of boards to select from.  I've never really had any preference here.<br />
<br />
Ram:  assuming 16 for a new build today minimum and prefer 32?  This is an easy &amp; cheap upgrade at a later date, so not sure where in the priorities it should be.<br />
<br />
Video:  this is the biggest who knows for me.  I prefer to stay with nVidia since their driver support tends to be rock solid versus my (outdated) experience with ATI.  I don't know if 2 or 4 GB is where I should be.  Pricing here gets nutty quickly.  Again, quiet is important, but not if it means getting a non-future proof card.  It seems like the GeForce 970-ish line is where I should be?  The 980 price just seems to jump too much for what I am thinking?  Guessing I don't need SLI, but really open to more advice here.<br />
<br />
Harddrives:  Everyone/everything seems to say that SSD is the alpha and omega of everything.  I've always kept my OS and my own stuff separate.  Two SSDs seems to break the bank.  I also tend to have a variety of things installed.  I know I'd need at least a 500GB and prefer a 1 TB for the SSD to go along with my 4TB internal drive (new or can move my old one; fairly indifferent here).  Do I need to split the SSD into OS and game installs?  Given that I haven't done the reinstall OS regularly bit in a very long time I am afraid I might be projecting old needs into my current thinking.<br />
<br />
Case:  I have a normal tower now.  It is loud.  Quiet is my game here I think.  Even if I can't get quiet on the video card the case should be able to mitigate a bunch of it.  It isn't like I overclock and go nutty.  I am just tired of it sounding like an airport in the computer room between our two, 10 year old machines.  <br />
<br />
Power Supply:  I saw PS that didn't have cords flowing out of them.  It looks like you now plug into the PS and the other stuff directly?  That looks kindof neat.  It might make cable management a bit easier.  I don't have much opinion here either other than quiet, but with enough to run what I need (current machine has 3 physical hard drives in it, although I have an old smaller drive I'd eliminate in a future machine).</div>

			A rat the size of a toddler has been captured by stunned pest control experts after terrorising residents in Grimsby. <br />
<br />
THESE pictures reveal a new breed of super rat has emerged, after a giant rodent was discovered at a private property in the UK.<br />
<br />
The huge creature measuring 60 centimetres was caught by S.W.A.T Total Pest Control in Grimsby after one of their technicians, Spencer Harris, was called to a house to deal with reports of vermin running across the patio.<br />
<br />
Despite a recent surge in “fake” pictures of giant rats, S.W.A.T’s Jeff Sullivan said this beast was the “real deal” amid fears that a “plague” of super rats could develop due to a mild winter.<br />
<br />
“A lot of people take photos of rats at various angles to make it look larger than it actually is, but this is exactly as you see it,” Mr Sullivan said.<br />
<br />
“I have been doing pest control for a considerable amount of time and this is the biggest we have ever caught.<br />
<br />
“You read and hear so many stories about super rats but we could not believe this one.”<br />
<br />
Based in Skegness, Lincs., S.W.A.T Pest Control confirmed it has definitely seen a trend of larger rodents appearing.<br />
<br />
“Rats definitely seem to be getting bigger and it is worrying that they are getting this large,” Mr Sullivan said.<br />
Jeff Sullivan says it’s the biggest rat he has ever seen. Picture: Snapper<br />

<br />
“A dog is not going to take them on. I’d certainly be concerned if my dog came face to face with that rat. And if there is one male rat of that size, there will be a female one too.”<br />
<br />
The rat was recently caught at a house in Humberston, North East Lincs. Mr Sullivan said he believed it had a “free run” eating very high protein food.<br />
<br />
“Another key factor is rats like eating a lot of maize products, as they are enriched with vitamin K which works as an antidote to rat poison,” he said.<br />
<br />
“Maize is often grown in fields which makes sense in this instance. It’s the size of the teeth that are a concern as well.”<br />
<br />
<b>He said the size of the rat was unusual.</b><br />
<br />
“I just take this as a day-to-day job but every now and then you get something unusual and this is a very large rat,” he said.<br />
<br />
“You hear a lot of stories - fishermen’s tales if you will, people saying it’s bigger than their dog and that sort of thing - but we trapped this and we caught it.<br />
<br />
“It’s definitely real.”<br />
<br />
A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council, who no longer provide pest control, advised anyone with concerns about rats or other vermin to contact a reputable pest control service.

			Cuba is running low on beer.<br />
<br />
Visiting tourists have been drinking up the beer supply and the country's main manufacturer, Bucanero, is having issues keeping up, according to the Costa Rica Star.<br />
<br />
This year, the company will produce 19 million cases of its beer — the brands include Cacique, Mayabe, Bucanero and Cristal, Cuba's most popular beer — and will import 3 million cases of Dominican Republic beer, Presidente.<br />
<br />
Along with thirsty visitors, Bucanero has also had issues with shipping delays of brewing malt from the Czech Republic, all leading to less beer for sale.<br />
 <br />
To keep up with the drinking crowds, Bucanero will need to build a new plant in Cuba, Reuters reported.<br />
<br />
Also causing an increase in demand are privately owned cafes and restaurants that are competing with state-run bars for the beer supply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Private bars can go out and find supplies where they can,&quot; a manager of a state-run bar told Reuters. &quot;I can only sell what the government gives me.&quot;  When that bar ran out of beer, Reuters reported, a privately run operation upstairs from the bar had its own supply of beers to sell.<br />
<br />
The number of tourists have increased over the past years with Cuba welcoming a record 3.5 million visitors in 2015, according to Reuters. American travelers to Cuba have also increased, with 161,000 tourists visiting the country after the last of the U.S. travel restrictions on Cuba were lifted.

			Putin Gets His Own Army<br />
April 10, 2016 8:00 AM EST<br />
By<br />
Leonid Bershidsky<br />
<br />
President Vladimir Putin has overhauled Russia's law-enforcement operations to create a domestic army that ultimately would answer to him personally, not to one of the government ministers. It was the clearest demonstration in years of the Russian leader's concern about preserving his power.<br />
<br />
Vladimir Putin<br />
<br />
On April 5, Putin submitted a bill to the Russian parliament that carved out a National Guard from the Interior Ministry's Interior Troops. The Interior Ministry is essentially the police force; the 170,000-strong Interior Troops are the crack riot police and counterinsurgency units. During Putin's first two presidential terms, they bore the brunt of the fighting in the formerly secessionist region of Chechnya, and they have dispersed many unsanctioned rallies. <br />
<br />
In addition to the Interior Troops, all of the ministry's elite units, nicknamed &quot;cosmonauts&quot; by opposition activists for their round helmets and &quot;Star Wars&quot;-like gear, will also be included in Putin's army, with the potential for further expansion. Immediately, the number of National Guard personnel will exceed 15 percent of the Russian armed forces that are supposed to deal with external threats. <br />
<br />
This powerful, well-trained force will operate outside the ministry under the command of Viktor Zolotov, a long-time Putin associate, whom the president appointed head of his personal bodyguard immediately after moving into the Kremlin in 2000. Like many Putin friends in government service, he is far wealthier than his official income could ever allow, and he is far more personally loyal to the president than Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev. Zolotov will report directly to Putin. <br />
<br />
As the political scientist Tatyana Stanovaya wrote for the Russian Carnegie Center, regardless of whether the interior minister is a close associate of Putin's, or even one of his judo sparring partners, &quot;at a hypothetically possible moment of high tension, his hand will tremble when orders must be followed. Zolotov enjoys maximum protection from such hesitation. Putin -- and Zolotov as an extension of Putin -- will have no more intermediaries.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the same way, the National Guard's loyalty is more certain than that of the Defense Ministry, run by the popular -- and, reportedly, increasingly independent -- Sergei Shoigu.<br />
<br />
The new National Guard has its own intelligence service and thus investigative powers. It also has been granted authority to issue firearm licenses to private individuals and security firms -- almost 10 million people, from hunters to elite bodyguards. The National Guard also has been granted the right to fire without warning &quot;in special cases&quot; and to not introduce themselves when making an arrest.  <br />
<br />
The Interior Ministry will be severely weakened by the reform. Whenever it needs muscle, it will have to ask Zolotov. As a consolation prize, Kolokoltsev, not a member of Putin's inner circle, gets the 27,000 employees of the Federal Service for the Control of Narcotics and most of the former Federal Migration Service, which issues passports. The ministry is handed all the routine police work, and it loses its status as the Kremlin's most powerful protector.<br />
<br />
Putin last reshuffled the &quot;power ministries&quot; in 2003, mostly to bring them closer in line with the Soviet institutions of his youth. The new moves appear to be more significant, both because Russia's ruler is personally taking control of an army and because of the timing. Parliamentary elections will be held in September -- though it won't be a significant  event because the resulting legislature will likely rubber-stamp Kremlin decisions just as the current one has, but if the vote is as blatantly rigged as it was in 2011, protests could break out again. Although pollsters still report high levels of support for Putin after the military actions in Ukraine and Syria, Russians also are under stress because of a continuing economic slump. According to the Russian Central Bank, the country's economic output shrank about 1 percent in the first quarter of 2016, compared with a year earlier. <br />
<br />
Putin, who appears to believe that the U.S. and its Western allies are out not just to destabilize his regime but to bring about Russia's break-up, is taking no chances. He clearly is timing the reorganization to be completed well ahead of the election. By the time of the presidential election in 2018, the National Guard will have ironed  out its kinks. It will have all the powers and functions necessary to counteract a putative Western plot and do away with any overly loud or violent dissent.<br />
<br />
Once again, instead of opening up and liberalizing, the embattled Putin regime is closing in on itself, and the man sitting on top of it is taking on more and more direct powers. The National Guard is a manifestation of Putin's mistrust of Russia's remaining institutions: He feels more confident surrounded by old friends and in control of a large fighting force.

			North Korea says it has successfully tested an engine designed for an intercontinental ballistic missile.<br />
<br />
The new type of engine would &quot;guarantee&quot; the ability to launch a nuclear strike on the US mainland, the KCNA news agency said.<br />
<br />
The test was conducted at the country's long-range missile launch site near its west coast.<br />
<br />
It is the latest in a series of tests and launches carried out by the isolated nation.<br />
<br />
Can South Korea defend itself?<br />
<br />
Dealing with the North: Carrots or sticks?<br />
<br />
How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme?<br />
<br />
Leader Kim Jong-un supervised the test, state media reported, during which &quot;the engine spewed out huge flames with a deafening boom&quot;.<br />
<br />
The country would now be able to &quot;keep any cesspool of evils in the earth including the US mainland within our striking range,&quot; Mr Kim was quoted as saying.<br />
<br />
In March, North Korea said it had developed nuclear warheads small enough to fit on ballistic missiles.<br />
<br />
However, experts cast doubt on the claims.<br />
<br />
March also saw North Korea threaten &quot;indiscriminate&quot; nuclear strikes on the US and South Korea as they held big joint military drills, which the north sees as a rehearsal for an eventual invasion.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the US has imposed new sanctions on North Korea following a nuclear test in January and a satellite launch in February, which was widely seen as a test of banned missile technology.<br />
<br />
The US has also held talks with South Korea aimed at deploying a US missile defence system to the Korean peninsula, a move strongly opposed by North Korea, Russia and China.<br />
<br />
Beijing says the Thaad anti-missile system compromises its security and would undermine its nuclear deterrent.<br />
