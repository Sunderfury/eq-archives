<br />
I don't know much about it, all I've seen so far is that they are claiming to have listened to complaints surrounding the second game and intend to address what people did not like about it. <br />
<br />
Wiki claims the game will take place in Orlais, and revolve around a civil war between mages and templar. The game will feature a new protagonist.<br />
<br />
I've seen it mentioned that two of the Bioware teams are working on it, but with the way EA whores out that name lately I've got no idea what that even means. I still retain the right to hope that the game will be competent, at the least.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh right, and it is going to be using the Frostbite 2 engine, which seems to be the go to engine for EA lately. This is the engine that was developed for Battlefield, and allows for destructive environments.</blockquote>

I do think taking a dark souls, leaderboard, Dragons dogma bots, or spetator mode (THAT IS OPTIONAL!) would be cool but i wouldnt go past that. if ya must maybe a hoard mode. co-op sorry but resident evil 5 put me off of that as it really streamlined the singleplayer game a lot.</blockquote>

</div>at the worst end of the spectrum would be them pulling an ME3 and requiring you to use Multiplayer and an app limited to a single mobile ecosystem to get the absolute best ending.</blockquote>

</div>Ha, I watched that a few weeks ago, too, and had pretty much the same reaction.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of rumors that Cassandra will be a companion in DA3.</blockquote>
