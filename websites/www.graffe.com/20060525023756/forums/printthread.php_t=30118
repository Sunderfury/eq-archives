		<div>Hi all... My question *or concern* is that why do wizards and some other classes not have an epic yet...<br />
<br />
Some people are saying wizards have one and that if you buy those quest books that &quot;Sage Indus Saurion&quot; has and complete them all... you get your epic or the main epic quest <br />
<br />
See thing is i see that the 3 epics that are out for some classes *do not know if there is more than 3* actually cant be used by caster types.<br />
<br />
But some good caster items are as a reward for casters for parts of it *I.E. a staff that is in the &quot;dusty stone&quot; quest for what i think is the &quot;ghoulbane&quot; epic quest. brings me to think that.. Did Casters get left out or is it that each epic out of those 3 also give casters a caster type epic...<br />
<br />
This has been in my head for a bit.. <br />
<br />
but, if there really is a caster type epic for casters then where can i start it and at what lvl of combat</div>

One day you will have revenge with Heritage items much better suited to casters than melee.  The lower level Heritages do include several weapons and not much Mage bias but your time will come.  The Heritage weapons aren't all that Epic though, just the best weapons that most people are likely to have at a number of levels.</div>

		<div>EQ1 didn't add epics until the Kunark expansion. Personally, I don't think epics would quite fit with EQ2 at all becaue of the heavy dependency on raiding to get them. But if they do put them in, it will likely be in an expansion as well. That said, they also aren't likely to be class specific, as <i>nothing</i> is in EQ2, it's all skill-based.</div>

<br />

<br />

<br />
This is the quest for the Serrated Bone Dirk. It is given by Leelav Yekl on the beach near the docks (to left if facing out from docks) in the Enchanted Lands. <br />
<br />

The guy who posted the screenshot of the Prismatic was complaining that his other weapon (Vicious Sai) was outdamaging his &quot;Epic&quot; Prismatic, although for the difficulty of the quest Prismatics probably should be the best weapons in the current game, same as Epics were during Kunark.<br />
<br />
Ghoulbane, Yak, SBD, SBH and PGT are Heritage quests that are among the most complex and time consuming and/or difficult quests at their level so are generally excellent at the level you can equip them, but in time the player will want to upgrade them.</div>
