		<div><b>Wizard - List Update scheduled for 08/05/05</b><br />
 <br />
1) Short to Medium term damage - <font color="DarkRed">Some changes with direct damage spells went live with the April 20th update.</font><br />
<br />
Wizards are currently falling further and further behind in these areas, areas that they should actually excel given the major limitations on their damage potential. In reality, any class that isn't mana based should not even come close, and yet, many do, often exceeding the class by more than a minor amount. This is just exacerbated by the current trend of making fights last longer again, which actually only hurts classes that have built in limits on their damage, Wizards being the one that is probably the most affected by it. And this is without even taking into account mob abilities that affect casters to an even greater extent (high resists, mana drains, and even total immunities to spell damage).<br />
 <br />
2) Long term damage -  <font color="DarkRed">Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.</font><br />
<br />
While Wizards tend to be be more focused on short term damage, they do suffer a lot when it comes to long term damage in groups because their damage is all mana based. This tends to mean that classes that come very close to or even exceed them in short term damage just destroy them when it comes to long term damage because they have no such limitations. Some ideas may be help with mana regen in places where this is a problem, or an extended line of spells that address this problem (lower dps, but higher efficiency).<br />
<br />
 <br />
3) Manaburn - <font color="DarkRed">Changes to manaburn are in the works, these changes are nearly finalized design wise however we will need to wait on coding for full implementation.</font><br />
<br />
A Wizard can currently spend their entire mana bar to do a little over 9k damage in 5 seconds - leaving the wizard completely helpless and out of mana afterwards. At the same time Ancient Strike of Chaos - our best fire-based nuke can crit for over 8k using less than 1 bubble of mana and taking 1 more second to cost. The damage cap on manaburn should be removed (with the exception of PvP), and it should be returned to its pre-nerf state.<br />
 <br />
4) Aggro problems - <font color="DarkRed">Changes to the way aggro is gained through spells is being considered with part #1 of the Class Re-Envision Process.</font><br />
<br />
As spell damage goes up, aggro also increases. And so does mob damage output. So the penalty for gaining aggro for any reason can often be almost instant death. Currently Maelin's legs are the only real method used for aggro control at the high end, and they put Wizards roughly where they should be in terms of overall damage, while allowing some capability to maybe escape death when the MT goes down. But as spell damage goes up, they will become more of a limiter on how much dps rises because aggro is still going to be the main limitation, which would essentially leave Wizards in the same spot (concussion is a fixed amount, it doesn't scale in the manner that Evade can if you get too high on the list and there is no version of Wizard 'Escape'). Going back to spell based Concussion doesn't really solve the overall problem, it just increases the chance that Wizards will die when the MT does while likely lowering overall dps.<br />
<br />
5) Resists -<font color="DarkRed"> Currently being discussed</font><br />
<br />
Wizards were supposed to be able to have an innately better chance of landing spells than any other class because all of our damage is based on mana, and resists affect both our short term and our long term damage (a resist, unlike a miss, is not something you can recover in the long term because it has a cost, the mana you used is already spent and did nothing but increase your aggro). When the resist change went in, this was basically handled under the new system by giving some of our spells a resist modifier, but not all. Magic spells, for example, do not share the resist modifier that fire and cold spells get. Also, as you level and go further into the high end of an expansion, the resists also tend to get worse. It would be nice to Look into whether or not the resist modifiers on the current spells are where they should be and seeing if the penalty for being resisted is perhaps too high as well. Magic based spells should get the resist adjustment the other spells have as well.<br />
 <br />
6) Low/Mid Level Wizard Damage - <font color="DarkRed">Currently being discussed, This will most likely be considered as part of the class Re-Envision process.</font><br />
<br />
While melee have every expansion gained numerous new weapons available at the lower levels that are markedly better in dealing out damage, casters have essentially remained static, casting the same spells they have always cast since the beginning. Slightly larger mana pools and minimally better mana regen hasn't really helped this too much. This has led to a situation where they are outdamaged in both the long and short term by melee, especially Wizards because there is no pet damage to fall back on (which can be helped with newer 'trash' weapons or pet only weapons in much the same way as melee). Suggestion would be to perhaps revisit the spell lines of lower and midrange casters to give some updated spells, perhaps available off harder encounters of those levels to alleviate the situation.<br />
<br />
7) AA Issues<br />
- Frenzied Devastation -While the last change upped the efficiency of the ability, it still seems like it loses efficiency on average at the base level. If you add in the fact that focus items aren't even considered in the equation, this ability definitely loses comparative efficiency, the better your focus items, the worse off you are. It would actually be nice if this actually gained slightly in efficiency as you got more levels simply because it currently on par with similar melee abilities to gain DPS which don't seem to have the same problems. <font color="DarkRed">Currently being discussed</font><br />
- Ward of Destruction - The damage done by the spell even at the max level is extremely low and the static nature of it also makes the damage output even less reliable.  <font color="DarkRed">Currently being evaluated.  Rashere is currently looking into ways to make this AA more useful. </font> <br />
- Familiars - Should be more of a reason to use the GoD familiars, currently they are only used on short fights where you don't have a Bard because of the lack of mana regen and resists as well as the fact they are only dedicated to one resist type. It would also be nice if the other AA familiars were changed to the same 1 minute recast and instant cast as these. - <font color="DarkRed">Currently being discussed </font> <br />
- Strong Root – Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn’t overwrite it. - <font color="DarkRed">Currently being discussed</font><br />
 <br />
8) Stuns -<font color="DarkRed"> NEW</font><br />
<br />
Stuns currently seems to be less than they should be, at least compared to how they used to work. One of the current problems is that they cap to low to be as useful as they could be, and a side effect of the cap is that it leaves a gap in being able to use stuns while you are leveling up at some points. Would be nice to see the level cap raised so that you can at least attempt to stun yellow mobs when you are at the max level. Raising the current cap on the higher level stuns by 2-3 levels would make them more useful in groups as well as fix the gap problem.<br />
<br />
9) Concussion being affected by Spell Casting Subtely <font color="DarkRed">New, however there is a fix in the works, however the fix requires coding changes.  Unfortunately at this time there are other coding issues that have higher priority. </font> <br />
<br />
Currently Concussion is being affected by SCS, lowering its effectiveness by 20% if you have SCS 3. Given that aggro is one of the limiters on a Wizardability to do damage (not to mention the thing that determines whether you are going to live or not in a lot of situations) and that Concussion is one of the extremely few tools Wizards get to manage it, this is something that needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
10) Teleporting issues - <font color="DarkRed">Currently being discussed</font><br />
<br />
Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind for Teleport and Evacuate spells <br />
The base time and mana cost on some port spells seems rather excessive (Knowledge Portal as a level 39 spell for 600 mana and 24 seconds being one of these, porting to Hate, a higher level spell, is only 300 mana and 10 seconds). <br />
Some method of removing the requirement for fragments being used for translocates. Removing the reagant requirements from Hate/Sky with the same method would also be appreciated. <br />
More useful locations that aren't 1 zone or less away from PoK. Community suggestions on new port locations - <br />
Riftseekers<br />
Western Wastes<br />
Plane of Traquility<br />
Chardok – Near Chardock B<br />
Dragon Necropolis<br />
Dranik’s Scar<br />
Timorous Deep<br />
Crypt of Nadox<br />
Lake Rathe - <font color="DarkRed">With the announcement of a portal to the Arean being added to the Plane of Knowledge we may want to remove this location.</font><br />
Umbral Plains – Near the Maiden’s Eye zone line<br />
Ocean of Tears <br />
Decession - Make Decession a bit more 'raid' friendly by either allowing it to work on anyone in a raid or giving a short timer TL box when cast on someone outside of your group (it needs to retain the no box ability inside your group in either case). <br />

		<div>Agro problems -- I'm losing more and more confidence in the integrity of the Devs. They CAN implement a higher version of concussion which WILL wean players off of the concussion pants. The spell should be MUCH better then Ancient Greater Concussion. One second cast time and like 1000 agro reduction. This needs to be implemented in the next expansion. Spell Casting Subtlety is OVERDUE for an upgrade in AA's this needs to be implemented in the next expansion. You can make it require so many different AA's and have it be level 70 only. The more levels, spells and AA's we have the more that the earlier expansions will be broken. Stop holding back our class.<br />
<br />
Resists - They need to go both ways. That means that if whatever (Magic, Fire, Ice) the mob is casting we should be the MOST likely to resist it as a class. We should resist it where melee that are not beings of magic get hit by it. Want to talk about class re-envision. Why do melee not worry as much about AE's? Because they have the extra HP to deal with it and can wait longer with the same resists for a heal. I have to stop and re-rune to help survive the next AE. We need to be ultra resistant to these attacks.<br />
<br />
AA Issues - We are developing so many useless AA's its unfair. How does origin help us? I suggested a fix for this early on (change to instant-cast), when I returned to the game. We have more Spell Damage AA's then any other magic class, we should have more magic resistance AA's then any other class.<br />
<br />
Teleport - Need a new AA for making so that the next TL you cast can be an AE version with a box too. Need AT LEAST gate spells to anywhere those Magus can send people. Let them drop us right into the middle of the Magus camps. I don't agree with having Teleport or gate locations to dungeons. How many of those do we have? None, because Cazic really isn’t a dungeon it's a temple.<br />

		<div>I agree with the concussion spell... but let's make it easier to get a hold of, or a very large percent of the wizard population will not be any better off.

A collection quest throughout various DoN zones, NO RAIDS.  While I understand that raiding is a huge part of the game... it should not be the ONLY way to get the things we need to survive.</div>

Could it be possible that wizards would eventually get a skill that when a spell is resisted they use up only a smaller part of the mana versus the spell landing for any amount of damage?

Of course, we would still have the penalty for casting the spell in terms of agro.</div>

Think this is the problem.  It shows up in issue number 1 and 2.  But basically the wizard class is dps with a few minor things.  Untill this addressed we are talking about what shade of lipstick to put on the pig for the beauty contest.  Yea mana burn sucks, yea ports are in bad spots, yea there are huge issue with aggro, yea elemental flappies dont stack with stuff.  <br />
<br />
Untill Overall DPS is balanced, most will say heck get a warrior for the wiz spot he can off tank better and has similar dps.<br />

Do we as the Wizard community think there is anything else that has been resolved on this list with the recent expansion?</div>

<i>Strong Root &#8211; Shorten recast timer and make it so Greater Fetter doesn&#8217;t overwrite it. - Currently being discussed</i><br />
<br />
Whoever put that into the list seriously needs to delete their wizard.  I'm really annoyed that we lost out on actually getting necessary fixes because this year old and never useful AA.</div>

		<div>Actually, that particular item was one of the holdovers from the original one that was the result of a vote held here long ago. The list was the last one before they stopped using them. I'll probably unsticky it at some point.<br />
<br />
In any case, it would be hard to see how we actually lost out on anything because of it since if the one AA that affects it was removed from the expansion, there wouldn't have been a replacement for it.</div>

		<div>I still disagree.  Idea seeking dev reading the wizard class issues list without that &quot;issue&quot; on it, would have read and possibly worked on something else that actually is needed instead.  An absolutely 100% useless AA being removed even at the SLIGHT chance that something useful may have replaced it, is worth it in my opinion.  Perhaps the dev whos &quot;bright&quot; idea it was to put the root crud AA fix in might have lingered on the previous point and put in an actual fix to having all the multiflavored familiars.</div>

Also, in the meantime, please do unsticky the top 10/issues lists, they are old and in need of serious revision.</div>
