The line up through Bazil Thredd was beautifully done, but there are so many unanswered questions that I would hate to see butchered in the way the Eranikus line was. <br />
<br />
Yes, I am still bitter about that. :) Months and months of checking Umbranse for more information after every patch, and he gets randomly put in as a token NPC fight and saved by an NPC being protected by a raid that had absolutely nothing to do with his soul in the gem.</div>

Yes. If you haven't gone back to that troll since ZG went in, go back. The quest line is complete and fun -- congrats, players, you unleashed Hakkar on the world! :evil:<br />
<br />
I think of the Defias/Missing Diplomat line as being one thing. We do need it wrapped up, although I think the best time to do it would have been as part of the Onyxia key quest.<br />
<br />
I'm more interested in Uldum being opened as a free add-on dungeon. The dwarf storyline starts in Dun Morogh, lets us know the world is in danger, we get to Ulduman, find out where the troggs are from, find out the Titans are returning and ... and ... and ...<br />
<br />
Of course, even before that, we need to find out where Admiral Proudmoore's fleet went. It's sure taking a long time to circle and map Kalimdor. Either there needs to be a GM event of them bombarding Orgrimmar finally, or we need to see a shipwreck. The unused southern 3/4 of the Isle of Dread would be a good spot for it.</div>

Scythe - won't be fixed because they screwed it up very early on in the game and didn't expect people to come back to it. (Much like they forgot about the Greymane wall... :) ). It was *clearly* suppossed to end up in Arugals hands, the storylines match up, then bang it ends without warning.<br />

		<div>Ringo sums it up nicely. I did the Trias bit with Clara's Apples (Incedentally, the cheese guy is the most awesome NPC ever) but didn't really feel like it was resolved.<br />
<br />
The scythe can't be abandoned because the dark riders from Deadwind Pass were after it! Meaning there ought to be some sort of connection in Kharazhan, only I'd bet there won't be. :(<br />
<br />
Eranikus' quest was &quot;finished&quot; by the AQ40 quest line the same way that a sex partner &quot;finishes you&quot; by getting up and telling you not to hit the sheets. It was completely unconnected, having him magically being saved by his faith in Elune (!!!) and the intervention of an NPC is not a cool quest, at best it's foreplay for the people at the ultra-high-end.</div>

		<div>There is no connection in Karazhan with the scythe in any way. This is because, to be frank - they fucked up the quest line. <br />
 Clearly, at some point, alliance players were meant to have a series of quest lines linking the scythe to Arugal and then have them go into Shadowfang Keep to kill him and recover it. Along the way, this got scrapped for whatever reasons, and the tie-ins for the quest line abandoned. <br />
<br />
Tieing it up now would require a lot of re-jiggling of existing quest lines, and also would have had no relevance for any Horde players or any alliance players who missed that obscure quest line. So I don't think it will ever get resolved at any point, primarily because they messed up the quest lines and fixing them wouldn't be worth the effort or the cost. <br />
<br />
There is absolutely no doubt that Arugal was suppossed to end up with the scythe - the Horde quest lines make it very clear that Arugal suddenly got hold of a very powerful magical artifact which he used to summon all the Worgen into Silverpine and curse Pyrewood village, and that he has virtually 0 magical power on his own. It clearly just got missed when they were finishing up the game, and so, like many things, has just gone on to become a folk lore legend for us quest obssessed people who follow these things... :)</div>

I just think logistically it's very hard to do that quest line any justice for the players who are on it. It's been built up so much now, that just having it drop off a random Karazhan boss would be pretty pointless. And the problem is, anything more complex than that and theyhave to go back and add in a Horde questline mentioning it - and probably a more obvious alliance quest line... :)<br />
<br />
I think they will just leave it hanging as &quot;one of the mysterys of World of Warcraft&quot;, just because the time needed to make it worthwhile and explain all the plot holes is too much and too complex - remember, they *will* have to fill in the Horde missing sides, you can't just have it turn up in Karazhan. The entire story behind Arugal needs explaining as well.</div>

You didn't answer the question: In what way was it forgotten about? Gilneas isn't open yet. What do you want them to do? Have quests involving urinating on the walls and putting graffiti on the wall? Maybe getting a trampoline and trying to jump over the wall?<br />
<br />
When Gilneas opens, there will be quests and events relating to Gilneas. Until then, this is like complaining that they forgot about Northrend.<br />

<br />
I'm not using this as a demonstration about them being crap or anything, I'm just saying - there's a *lot* of early quest lines, like the Scythe of Elune, Arugal, the Greymane Wall stuff that has been abandoned. Some of it will be easier to go back too, like the Greymane Wall. Other bits of it are going to be a lot harder (The Scythe). In summary - they aren't perfect, and they do forget about areas and quest lines, and sometimes it doesn't signify anything other than just a forgotten quest line.</div>

What is there to conclude? All the quests talked about were that the Lordaeron refugees at the Greymane Wall were being denied entry into Gilneas. I&#8217;m not sure there needs to be any more explaining than that, since Gilneas was always an isolationist nation and it seceded from the Alliance. And I don&#8217;t remember anyone in the Sepulcher wondering what&#8217;s happening in Gilneas either.</div>
