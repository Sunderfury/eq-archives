			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>God damn it Google, get your shit together.  <br />
<br />
First they decide to store everyones' network info in the clear, which is a massively incompetent [1]; next we find out that Google's entropy pool is broke in a fundamental way, an issue which affects all apps which use Google's entropy pool. [2, 3, 4]<br />
<br />
Two months ago we find out that Google (Apple, FB, Yahoo, and Microsoft) are all sharing data with the NSA, which is incredibly disconcerting and ensures US business suffers as international and domestic companies cannot rely on their services, regardless of societal impacts beyond economics. [5, 6, 7, 8]<br />
<br />
Google in particular is significant, perhaps more so than the others as there is a great deal of benefit to using their services, and affects me a great deal for various reasons.<br />
<br />
I won't be surprised if using those services becomes results in non-compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley, which would be obscenely ironic. [9]<br />
<br />
Previously, Google nearly dropped XMPP support for Google talk, and then reinstated it. [10]<br />
<br />
Publicly they claimed it was an accident resulting from an anti-spam measure though. [11]<br />
<br />
However, Google is moving away from federated support towards Google Talk which is merging with Google Hangouts.  [12]<br />
<br />
Personally, I agree with that move as it was personally something which caused me to get the iPhone 5 as I found the situation very confusing*, however greater integration of services offered does not entail creating a walled garden; they could still utilize open protocols to do so instead of betraying their past behaviors.   <br />
<br />
And, you can no longer restrict automatic archiving of chats; I still would not have used the service for secure communications, but it is telling of Google's shifting philosophy away from a hacker culture. [13]<br />
<br />
Further, Google has not updates their related help documentation to reflect that distinction. [14]<br />
<br />
And, despite *no* engineering reason to limit user's usage of upload bandwidth, instead of acting as a paradigm shifting innovative-company, Google has chosen to act in the same fashion as other ISPs and cripple user's ability to use their own and paid for Internet access based on an increasingly ambiguous distinction between what is a server and what is not. [15] <br />
<br />
Despite all of this, the main frustration is Google's rampant killing off of innovative or essential services, which while potentially positive for their accountants and suits, ends up reducing how likely Google will continue to support services whose API developers and transitively users' are reliant upon.<br />
<br />
It is sufficiently prevalent to the extent that I am incredibly wary of using any Google service or product that I cannot change out for a competing offering easily, even when that service is possibly nicer to work with or has synergy with other areas.<br />
<br />
Product cancellations are prevalent to the extent that Gwern took the time to compile and extrapolate past and future cancellations, and the Guardian estimates that Google Keep will be around for slightly less than four years. [16, 17]<br />
<br />
And, the suits killed what was potentially the biggest shift in computing and a boon for productivity by killing off Google Wave (now Apache Wave), they also could have provided information information security by controlling the service end to end. [18]<br />
<br />
The reason Google Wave would have been such a huge change in what was possible for user's to accomplish is that it had the potential to implement an entirely interactive environment where every object's functions could be utilized in concert, bringing UNIX's command line utilities to GUI applications, including online applications.<br />
<br />
Currently, that concept does not exist uniformly across an environment; the closest is OS X and that is only limited, and is nonexistent on OS X outside of Carbon and Cocoa apps.<br />
<br />
Such concepts are already implemented with the Wave extensions called Robots and Gadgets. [19]<br />
<br />
The only environment to ever realize that idea fully were the Lisp machines which exposed *every* function to the user, which is a side effect of Lisp being homoiconic**. [20]<br />
<br />
Homoiconicity allows the function's code to be manipulated both as data and instructions, and the Lisp machine OS was entirely transformable and composable because of the Lisp environment being fully interactive and modifiable, even the Lisp syntax itself. [21] <br />
<br />
Being a Lisp is not prerequisite for having those features, but it is very rare for a language to have both properties.<br />
<br />
There is no greater failure in computing in terms of its impact on our capacity to get things accomplished efficiently across the entire user base than the failure to have a uniformly composable environment.<br />
<br />
That Windows has become and has been for decades the most popular computing PC OS is a great detriment because of that, and it is even worse so than UNIX because its CLI userspace is incredibly incompetent in every imaginable way.  <br />
<br />
UNIX is really shitty in many respects, but Windows has managed to be even more daft despite its overwhelming amount of resources available for research and innovation.<br />
<br />
I cannot tell express to you in words how frustrating that there is no environment which realizes those ideas fully. <br />
<br />
I am so fucking tired of having to resort to command line tools and emacs just to get shit done without having to do what a computer, a machine which specializes in doing tedious shit repeatedly, manually.<br />
<br />
Put another way, computing is currently designed such that the most useful resource on the planet is doing already solved tasks over and over and over again, something which the greatest machine in the world is shitty at, even when an example of that machine manages to not seek out a rope and chair during a tedious, mind destroying death march.<br />
<br />
That is unfathomably idiotic design and a currently inescapable failure of imagination.<br />
<br />
And that is why Google Wave was such an obscenely promising project and a gut wrenching cancellation.<br />
<br />
Google Wave was widely considered a solution in search of a problem, and messaged as such.<br />
<br />
In reality,  Google Wave entailed a method for realizing a reduction in complexity, both of the implementation of abstractions and the route to realizing a task for humans.  <br />
<br />
I offer the following argument for why Google Wave (or  a similarly scriptable and composable environment) reduces complexity: consider the case of the many communication apps users' interact with daily. <br />
<br />
Social Networks where user's consume information (ads, posts, pictures, videos, games), write (responses to their social network), and print (publish) data.  The specific implementations of this are largely closed and have nonuniform methods of interaction to accomplish the previously mentioned occupations.  <br />
<br />
This insanity is seen on Facebook, Youtube, Google+, Twitter, Instagram, Pintrest, etc.<br />
<br />
E-mail, Instant Messaging, Online Chat Rooms, Video Conferencing, and Text Messages all have this attribute.  <br />
<br />
Even within the same operating system with the same toolkit this terrible heterogeneous UX occurs, and the downsides apply not just to communication but all of our computing interactions; communication is but one case of this.  <br />
<br />
A side effect is that interacting with such tools requires learning how to manipulate it in every instance and it is never intuitive as past experience does not transfer.  <br />
<br />
Even updates of the same application cause relearning of already know application behavior, a case of which is every update of Microsoft Office.  <br />
<br />
There are latent downsides to all of the above in many cases, but I won't go into them as the argument is very nuanced and boring.<br />
<br />
Google Wave had the capacity to fix this UX hellscape by integrating all facets of communication and more generally within the same application, and because it was a web UI it would have been entirely cross platform, making historical warts with various OS implementations an irrelevant edge case.<br />
<br />
Perhaps like Rob Pike a user vehemently disagrees with the merging of all related tools into the same interface, sourcing feature creep and sluggishness as a motivation for this belief. [22]<br />
<br />
Despite there being many cases of this occurring in the wild, such fear is unfounded in reality.<br />
<br />
It is a property of the majority of implementations that such attributes emerge, meaning that there is hope for moving past a world where such choices have to be made.<br />
<br />
A particular counterexample which demonstrates that we can have our cake and eat it too is how workflows are composed in Plan 9. <br />
<br />
In Plan 9, the UNIX philosophy is fully realized and so is the idealism of NeXTstep: the filesystem and protocol for sending and receiving both local and remote data was implemented such that applications can read from existing information sources and act upon that information, either by allowing an existing window to view that in real time or perform an operation on that data, such as in the case of a window exposing shell output to a user via a virtual view or an IDE exploiting generic tools that each solve a particular problem.  <br />
<br />
The effect of this idea is that the cost associated with implementing a desired feature was merely exploiting already provided tools, so a text editor could focus on only targeting text editing, not having everything and the kitchen sink because rolling your own solution or having to roll a new front end for that tool was necessary. <br />
<br />
In Plan 9 that idea exists with the Acme editor. [23]<br />
<br />
Observe how this solves many problems in one step in development a truly endless amount of composition in the environment as the only step between my desire for a feature and having that is attaching that tool to my interface via a generic, uniform method for doing so.<br />
<br />
An immediate impact in the real world is that exploiting a cluster of computing resources or local resources is entirely transparent and seamless instead of a property that requires app specific implementation to achieve.<br />
<br />
The idea of cloud computing is laughably benign in this case as it becomes a matter of obviousness due to Plan 9 being designed from the start to exploit concurrency across networks.<br />
<br />
Google has enough resources and mind share to pull off a uniform and composable UX, yet in none of its devices does it attempt to do so.  <br />
<br />
None of its environments provide uniform methods of composition across all of its applications, and that is a tragedy as Google has the capacity to benefit from history and do things right, freeing us from this bourgeoisie imprisonment by our own tools.<br />
<br />
The point being that despite all of our computing interactions abstractly falling into either reading, evaluating, or printing, none of our computing environments reflect that, and it is to the detriment of everyone as it makes our interactions less effective and more difficult to determine how to achieve in the long run.<br />

* I do get how it all comes together *now*, despite the disparate services for messaging, but at the time I was stupefied about how to do so without having to get an unlimited text plan and not being able to FaceTime on my phone, which is something that is important for myself.<br />
<br />
Even though I made a great deal of effort to try and wrap my head around how I could interact with most of my social network still, I was not able to do so with confidence about a year ago; I was going to trudge forward still, but the wait time for the latest Nexus was a couple of months at the time, and I wanted a new phone right away, so waiting that long was not something that I was interested in.<br />
<br />
I looked at the Samsung Galaxy S4 (?) or S3 maybe, whichever one was the latest circa October '12, and I did not like it in practice, despite it being attractive to me as a development platform and access to more of the Google ecosystem, which is why I ultimately went with the iPhone 5 despite initially feeling that it was not a good enough update to warrant the out of contract price.<br />
<br />
** I find it hard to believe that Mathematica is homoiconic, but many sources support that claim. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mathematica+homoiconic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mathematica+homoiconic</a><br />
<br />
An interesting historical note is that Stephen Wolfram eschewed an already existing symbolic programming language implementation only to essentially rebuild it in C after UNIX hit the scenes.<br />
<br />
&quot;A big early decision was what language SMP should be written in. Macsyma was written in LISP, and lots of people said LISP was the only possibility. <br />
<br />
But a young physics graduate student named Rob Pike convinced me that C was the 'language of the future', and the right choice. <br />
<br />
(Rob went on to do all sorts of things, like invent the Go language.) And so it was that early in 1980, the first lines of C code for SMP were written. <br />

(Rob went on to do all sorts of things, like invent the Go language.) And so it was that early in 1980, the first lines of C code for SMP were written.Before SMP, Id written lots of code for systems like Macsyma, and Id realized that something I was always trying to do was to say,'if I have an expression that looks like this, I want to transform it into one that looks like this'. <br />
<br />
So in designing SMP, transformation rules for families of symbolic expressions represented by patterns became one of the central ideas. It wasnt nearly as clean as in Mathematica, and there were definitely some funky and far-out ideas. But a lot of the core elements were already there.&quot; <br />

<br />
This is the stupidest fucking thing I have ever read from Wolfram. <br />
<br />
Why? Lisp specializes in symbolic manipulation, and is the lingua franca of such computing at that time, and not to disparage C (I can if you want me to go into that rant though), but C is a fucking horrible decision for this and the implementation of SMP (the language he made in C for his purposes) effectively reimplements the features Lisp already had and less competently, and  code transformations are something Lisp is obscenely good at doing, especially by 1980.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, implementing the necessary components to generate a Lisp is incredibly trivial, and amazingly was initially described on one sheet of paper by John McCarthy; read Lisp in Small Pieces sometime if you want to have a go at it.  It is a thus far timeless CS text. <br />

<br />
Lisp's focus on symbolic computations and code transformations are some of the reasons Lisp was the de facto language for AI research up until the late 1990s, where AI became horribly stagnant and did not make much progress. <br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>WTFF = What The Flying Fuck<br />
<br />
Two weeks ago, the guy my mom works part-time bookkeepping for gets a call from Verizon.  His wife answers.  They want to install &quot;a battery backup&quot; for their phone line.  Wife says &quot;okay.&quot;<br />
She tells hubby what will be done, and he says &quot;NO WAY, cancel.&quot;  She cancels the tech visit an hour later.<br />
<br />
3 days later, a bunch of FIOS trucks show up outside their house and start hanging fiber to string over to their house.  They get sent away.  <br />
<br />
How does &quot;battery backup for the copper-land-line phone&quot; turn into &quot;install FIOS&quot;!?<br />
<br />
Last Wednesday, the primary phone line at my mom's house died.  I verified this by testing additional phones, jacks, cables, and replacing jacks, connecting directly to the punch-down block in the basement, and even opened the customer-serviceable box outside the house and could only get a dial tone from one of the two phone line connections.<br />
<br />
I call Verizon for support and tell both first-line receptionist and second-line tech what I did and they schedule a tech for today.<br />
<br />
Mom gets a call from a tech at 8am today saying that the fiber run for FIOS for the house will be installed today.<br />
<br />
Wait, what?<br />
<br />
She says &quot;NO, we wanted copper line repair.&quot;  The tech hangs up with her, and she gets a call back from dispatch 10 minutes later.  Thankfully, I was actually at the house (replacing my alternator) at this point so I talked to the person on the phone and said:<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what you have in your notes. I can give you my service ticket number from 8/10.  But all I wanted was a copper land-line examination and repair.  There was NEVER anything said about fiber runs or FIOS install.  I just want my primary copper phone - my POTS line - to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
The line was dead silent (fucking iPhone on Verizon, but that's another rant entirely) before the guy finally said &quot;Let me look up your previous ticket&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then he says &quot;Oh, it looks like you have a copper landline problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, thanks, assmunch, I KNOW THAT.<br />
<br />
But how the FUCK is Verizon taking a &quot;copper repair order&quot; and turning it into a &quot;run fiber for FIOS&quot; order?</div>
