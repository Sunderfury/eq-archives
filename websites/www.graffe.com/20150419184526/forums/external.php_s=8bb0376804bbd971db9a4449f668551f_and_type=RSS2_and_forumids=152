I have wanted one of these for years. For most guys, its one of their first tools, others, their very first big purchase. For me, I've been dancing around, getting every other tool out there, before this one, and working with what I've got.<br />
<br />
Best part is that it is cordless. I got it to do finish carpentry and moulding/baseboards, so its portability doesn't necessitate a full size mitre table like a 10&quot;. <br />
<br />
Always wanted one of these. THis would have been a god send, back when I was building my own aquarium stands. The things I learned to do with a circular saw have become trivial in the 10 minutes I've used this. That experience certainly helped speed up some cuts, though.</div>

<br />
I gave little more than a shit about the scraping of the fender, because it is a work truck, but function over form, I was pissed to high hell that I was missing a mirror (I do prefer to park backwards in parking spaces), and until I put a new mirror on the flimsy frame that was left, i was all fucked in the way I drove (6 months?). For the past year and a half, I had an aversion to going on dirt roads (which I love) because if I either a) drove faster than 50 miles per hour or b) took a bump in the road, the damn mirror would be reflecting the ground, and I'd have to go through the chore of getting it just right again while driving, or pull over, altogether, to do it agian. <br />
<br />
When I had my insurance company look it over, they gave me a ridiculous number, just for the mirror (it was around $300) and they weren't even going to REPLACE the mirror. <br />
<br />
Well, Fuck that shit. i finally bought the mirror from amazon for $60, and replaced it this morning. <br />
