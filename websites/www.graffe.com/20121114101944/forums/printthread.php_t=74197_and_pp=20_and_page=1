</div>I can't speak to how realistic the sub, and life on it, are, but you would think that by now they would know a bit about it and get it right, or at least close.  To be honest I'm wondering how much it will be about the sub, it looks like it may be more about the island they find and the stuff going on there as a sub-plot.  I do hope the sub plays a big part in the series, though.<br />
<br />
So what did you think about the Hunt For Red October movie?  Was the sub totally unrealistic?  Granted it was a Russian sub, but it seems to me a sub is a sub.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">The Hunt for Red October did a decent job with the USS Dallas - probably because they filmed it on the USS Miami (both are 688-Los Angeles class attack subs). No worries there. The Soviet sub, Red October, was fictional, but most of the depictions there were reasonable. The stuff with the nuclear power was terrible, however, and didn't even make sense.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just bitter because, as a nuke, everything about the power systems is easily public knowledge, but the government *insists* it's all confidential. So, we never get to see or hear how critical an effective engineering space is to a submarine's mission. Just think about how often you saw Scotty or LaForge in Star Trek...<br />
<br />
Anyway, if they do beach/moor the sub near an island, it's very likely they'd continue to use the ship's power system to fuel their little town/city/settlement/whatever. The reactor on an Ohio-class boomer can power a city of 100,000, easily.<br />
<br />
I'll keep my eyes open for a chance to check out the pilot.</blockquote>

</div>It was my experience that the men and women will individually conduct themselves with the highest integrity and regard for their shipmates - except not. Each patrol was a 3-month bully/snark-fest, and there will be a lot of hurt women in that environment. Even surface ships have an issue - subs are that much more confined. :(<br />

</div>I have no doubt that the woman would do so, but there are 100+ male crewmembers and odds are that at least a handful of them will be douchebags and behave as such. It only takes one idiot, when you have 100+ men confined in a testosterone tube with only 1 woman it's just a matter of time before it goes bad.</blockquote>

</div>Maybe it can provoke a change of attitude towards bullying in general in the services. Is bullying a healthy thing for <i>anyone </i>- man or woman - to undergo - on a sub or anywhere else?<br />
<br />
But, heck, I think bullying should be taken extremely seriously even in schools. Imo, by the time people turn adult they should have grown out of it - and, if they haven't, leadership in whatever field we're talking about should be telling them to adjust their attitude or get the hell out.</blockquote>
