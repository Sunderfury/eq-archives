<br />
Needless to say, I'm pretty unhappy with this, as it makes the Frost tree the weakest PvP tree, and seriously lowers frost DPS on trash mobs.  It also makes Ice Lance a useless toy, since now you'll never get it off on a Frost Bite (by the time the proc shows up, you're usually already halfway done casting another Ice Bolt).<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note: Its on PTR, none of the CM's are talking about it, and its not in the patch messages.  It *could* be a bug, but it really seems like a nerf to something that is only overpowered when you get a huge burst of luck.</div></div><hr />

Instead of nerfing Frost Nova, they should reduce Shatter.<br />

I can't think of any other ability that increases a critical hit by a full 50%.</div></div><hr />

So you're better off casting Frost Bolt again instead of Ice Lance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maledict</div><div class="date">March 2nd, 2007, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nadiar - if you cast icelance as soon as you cast frostbolt on a frozen target, both will hit at the same time and count as hitting a frozen target for the purposes of damage &amp; shatter. Given that, when ice speced, this usually meant 5K damage on a taget in 2.5 seconds, I don't think it's that bad. Certainly when soloing &amp; grinding, the frozen effect ALWAYS broke after doing that. Doesn't matter our distance to the target or anything like that, it works every time as it's a timing issue. So this wont affect solo play at all or group play.<br />
<br />
It is however, a substantial nerf to frost in pvp - but from what I have seen, that might have been needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are more, but the armory stopped working while I was looking.  Those are the top two Mages on Battlegroup Bloodlust (considered the best PvP group, but we can't verify that until we do cross group tournements or something).  When I was looking yesterday, pretty much all of the top 10 PvP have the same spec, with only 1-2 tiny changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The change affects Frost Nova. Frozen targets were never intended to be frozen after a critical. However, the usage of Ice Lance made it very noticable that being frozen was persisting through being crit, whereas normal damage had a chance to break the state. By insuring that a crit will break the frozen state, back to back crits from Ice Lance won't be occurring and such spikes in damage disappear.<br />
<br />
I don't see how it makes Shatter useless, as you are still gaining higher chance of a crit, you just can't two-shot somebody with a zero second cooldown attack.<br />
<br />
This makes shatter completely fucking useless.  Its like a weak version of combustion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reality</div><div class="date">March 3rd, 2007, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">saw something like that coming, lots of ice lance whining on the official wow boards ;)<br />
<br />
getting your ice lance launched while the frostbolt is in the air for shatter bonus on both spells is still possible, right? if so it's not that much of a difference, my arc/ice 2800 frostbolt crits already had a ~95% chance to break frozen effects (2200 ice lances like ~90% to break frozen effects)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nadiar</div><div class="date">March 3rd, 2007, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, its a huge difference.  I don't know about you, but I'm already almost done casting the next Frost Bolt by the time the Frostbite proc will even show up.  The people suggesting you always Alternate between FB and Ice Lance aren't calculating in.<br />
<br />
If your Frost Bolts were breaking Frost Nova that often, you either don't pay attention, or you're wrong.  Frostbite, sure.  Frostbite almost never lasted through more than a single crit, and no one really cared.<br />
<br />
It won't just break on MAGE crits, it will always break on melee hits now too according to Tseric.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Basically Frost is now only useful as a Solo spec.  Less dps than druids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you understand mate. <br />
<br />
When frostbite procs, you're right - you're half way through asting your frostbolt. Continue casting the frostbolt. As *soon* as you finish casting it, hit the ice lance key - literally hammer it. You will cast the frostbolt and the ice lance att he same time, and both will hit the target att he same time and count as hitting a frozen target. You don't need to stop casting or anything - there's absolutely no break in rythym required in any way, it's a seamless cast sequence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish they'd just nerf Ice Lance directly instead of FN - nerfing FN hits all mages at all levels regardless of spec.  It seems especially harsh for PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nadiar</div><div class="date">March 3rd, 2007, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, okay.  But since ANYONE critting the frozen target means its broken, its impossible to even get out of that Frost Bolt unless you're soloing.  At best, you can make a macro to stop casting Frost Bolt and hit Ice Lance, and MAYBE get one crit Ice Lance out before its broken by your crit, or anyone else's crit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That happens a lot with ignite, since ignite procs from molten armor. It's even worse when you're sheeping something that's hitting you, and the last hit they get in procs ignite off molten armor, which then breaks your sheep. Very annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FilanFyretracker</div><div class="date">March 3rd, 2007, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard is pvp player lapdog honestly,  this and the PrOM nerf show that to them &quot;fixing&quot; things that arent broken to shut up the forums is their method.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maledict</div><div class="date">March 3rd, 2007, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And this doesnt change anything about ice lance mages in PvE soloing - absolutely nothing at all. I've *neveR* ever had an ice lance crit NOT break frostbite / frost nova in PvP since I started combining it with the frostbolt trick outlined earlier. <br />
<br />
In group play, yes it does lower it's power - but I have to be completely honest, what sort of groups are people playing with where a frostbite proc isn't instantly consumed instantly by your other group members anyway? I know when I was specced that way, I'd be lucky enough to get one ice lance off in an instance run in time. (POssibility - I always run with windfurying shaman, which means the mobs taking tons and tons of melee hits very very fast, which makes it break a lot easler than if you didnt have a shaman).<br />
<br />
It's definitely a huge pvp nerf, but I think most people saw it coming in some form. It shouldn't be broken by other gorup memebs crits thoguh, that is silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nadiar</div><div class="date">March 3rd, 2007, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frostbite will pretty much never stick.  Frost Nova on the other hand is currently very useful on trash.<br />
<br />
Oh, and from what testers are showing, any nuke that does more than 1000 damage will break Frost Nova, even if it isn't a crit.<br />
<br />
And what does it matter what kind of group you're in? TBC has so many instances where you're killing trash mobs that you have Frozen targets quite frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maledict</div><div class="date">March 3rd, 2007, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm making the point that alliance players may have frostbite last a *lot* longer on mobs because their melee doesn't have windfury. Frostbite &amp; Frost nova both get eaten up on trash mobs so fast it's incredibly rare that I ever get to ice lance them when I was that spec. <br />
<br />
It's always annoyed me that shatter &amp; frostbite are so limited - I've said for months they should debuff mobs so that they work even if the root effect is disabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reality</div><div class="date">March 3rd, 2007, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">even without shamans it breaks almost instantly in group situations. we're always two mages. if I get a frostbite procc his next spell breaks it and vice versa. as already stated not that much pve impact in this nerf</div></div><hr />

 Mind you, as an arcane fire mage I don't have any frost spell apart from Frost nova (rank 1), Cone of Cold (max rank) and frostbolt (rank1) on my hotbar anyway... :(</div></div><hr />

The change is a big time nerf to pvp, other than that it wont change much in solo play, and group play never counted on freeze effects.<br />

<br />
3 non Crit's on a Frozen Target &gt; 1 Guaaranteed Crit</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the frozen proc would never ever last through the dual combo frostbolt / icelance effect previously (at least, it never did for me) - I'd always assumed there was some sort fo damage cap or something on the effect, as it woudl always vanish after the double hit. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is a godo change - but I don't think it changes the mechanics of solo play very much, and if I were a pvp player I would still be an arcane / frost mage, because ice block &amp; huge crits is too powerful to give up, even without multiple ice lance hits.</div></div><hr />

I remember it having a steady 1k damage cap before being broken so I dont know what happened since then but the Ice Lance removing nova/bite isnt too bad at all. Its much better than what I would have expected otherwise.<br />
<br />
As for the Arena thing I still believe and have seen/experienced that Ice mages is THE arena spec due to 2x ice block/barrier/nova, especially with Ice Lance in the game it allows for the control/survivability/burst that is asked for in pvp. Fire is really nice, dont get me wrong, but when a mage is kiting a player and/or keeping himself self-reliant it makes a huge difference in pvp arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nadiar</div><div class="date">March 4th, 2007, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arc/Frost mages are the spec right now, not Frost.  In fact, Frost is the bottom of the pack for mage specs in PvP.<br />
<br />
The problem is, and was on the -10% nerf, Blizzard is Nerfing core spec's when the problem is on hybrid specs. Because of this, its forcing us more and more into hybrid specs, which I detest because of their reliance on &quot;I Win&quot; buttons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faustus</div><div class="date">March 4th, 2007, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've actually had targets remain frozen through multiple crits.   I'm occasionally able to follow up a frostbolt/lance double crit with a second lance and I've managed to crit on as many as 3 consecutive lances before (no frostbolt involved) just playing around with the spell when I first got it.  I'd say the freeze effect breaks on crits about 95% of the time for me.  So this is really not a huge loss in my mind.</div></div><hr />
