I admit I didn't know that any of them could be spared. At that point, I simply didn't give a shit anymore. I just wanted the thing over with. I tried to get past the soldiers in the hospital by stealth and the game threw a wrench in that plan by putting a pair of them <i>right next to the stairwell door</i> and not letting me leave until I'd killed them.

Do you, honestly and truly, think the ending where Ellie dies and Joel gets to grieve for another 20+ years and/or kills himself a happy ending? As stated previously in this thread, there's no guarantee that the vaccine is going to instantly put the world back together, although it is a step in the right direction. I'd be perfectly content with a well-written ending that went either way (Ellie survives/dies), but I am not happy because this ending is NOT well written. It is a cop-out that let's them COMPLETELY AVOID the fact that Joel is utterly in the wrong in deciding to choose Ellie over the fate of the human race. Now, he is perfectly welcome to be wrong, and it fits wonderfully with his character throughout the game. However, the entire point of a story is to come to a coherent end, to pass on a message to the reader/audience; stories must have a point, otherwise they have no reason to exist. Last of Us failed to do this, and that's why I'm incredibly frustrated, and even moreso due to the fact that no one is going to step forward and say that the ending was flat poorly written on a large enough scale to mean anything.<br />
<br />
A couple of sub-points as to why I'm annoyed at the ending. First off, as I said Ellie completely loses character in the ending scene. Given what we know of her, given everything she has said and done up until that point, there is absolutely zero chance that she's just going to go, &quot;Huh, pretty sure Joel's lying and I'm necessary for humankind of overcome this fucking spore bullshit in a timely manner. But fuckit, I've always wanted to be a daughter; let's go get ice cream!&quot; Just.... ergh, <i>no</i>. And it's not an &quot;ambiguous ending&quot;, unless you're allowing for Ellie to run away from Joel ASAP and track down the Fireflies herself. Assuming they're still functioning after Joel murdered a bunch of them and then shot their leader in cold blood.<br />
<br />
To address your point of Marlene not trusting Joel/not knowing his motives... in the sort of world that Last of Us presents, that doesn't strike you as a pretty sound reason to either flat out kill him or leave absolutely zero chance that he can fuck up your plan? Is it too much to ask for characters that aren't completely stupid? I mean, I'm not villainous mastermind, but even I know enough to at LEAST tie the guy down until after the surgery. Writers are NOT ALLOWED to make their characters completely stupid just for the sake of convenience. That's just crappy writing.<br />
<br />
The ending leaves you wanting because it doesn't SAY anything. It doesn't say that Joel made the right/wrong/wombat choice, doesn't give qualifiers to his choice (other than him being the only coherent character in the ending sequence), doesn't impart a message or hold a sign to humanity's failings. That feeling of wanting you have at the end is a symptom of a Crap Ending, and should NOT be held up as a good thing. There are no happy endings to the story, but there are coherent endings. We weren't given one, sadly.

Droigan, I would have LOVED your &quot;ideal ending&quot;, because it forces the reader to be shown the consequences and it either makes Joel choose to save humanity (Message Sent: Humanity &gt; single person), OR it makes him choose to &quot;rescue&quot; Ellie against her own wishes (Message Sent: Parents can be stupid where their kids are concerned. Stupidity likely punished in some way, either Ellie dies and cure is lost, or Joel is killed). Hell, I could fix the ending of the game by changing a single word. You know that recording from Marlene, when she's talking to Anna and mentions &quot;Your child&quot;? Change &quot;your&quot; to &quot;our&quot;.<br />
<br />
BOOM, completely new spin on things. And now Marlene has the (implied) right to make a decision about what happens to Ellie, and Joel can either go along with it or oppose her.

See above as to why I think the ambiguity of the ending is a Bad Thing. We don't need an ending with the characters acting like noble saints, and we CAN have an ending where humanity is not saved that has impact. The ending as it stands? Has NO impact, other than perhaps a jarring sense of &quot;What?&quot; and a brief note that apparently it's completely alright to just lie flat out to children if you think you're doing it for their own good. I think a happy, skippy, &quot;Ellie lives AND humanity is saved!&quot; ending would be pretty meh myself, although you could write it with a lot more coherency than what the game currently has certainly.<br />
<br />
I find it incredibly interesting that you use Great Gatsby as an example of nuanced literature, because I feel it to be another great example of crappy writing hailed as the Best Writing (trumpets!). 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
And now for something completely different: one thing I found particularly jarring in Last of Us (and find jarring in other games as well), is how Joel goes from being a warm, emotional human being in cut scenes... to him mowing through rooms of (semi) innocent people while under the player's control. So far as storytelling in games go, one has to note that murdering large numbers of fellow humans tends to do a number on the ol' psyche in the real world, PTSD being a thing and all. In fact, the only game that I know to treat this sort of thing relatively accurately is Spec Ops: The Line, and that's because their reply is, &quot;Well, yes. If you murder that many people you end up going stark raving bonkers.&quot; Is there any good way to resolve this sort of dichotomy while allowing the main character(s) to retain their sanity? An honest question, because I sure as heck can't think of a great answer.</div>

 I think you've missed the point of what the message in the game is. You keep searching for some higher moral statement that this game could be making. It doesn't. It just shows realistic responses to an apocalyptic world where people are pretty much on their own for their own survival (mixed in with the unrealistic reality of a video game where one or two people kill dozens of others with guns to progress). If you don't think that the ending that happened is completely out of the realm of what human beings would do, then you need to observe human nature a bit more. How many couples live with a lie to keep their marriage together? How many times do people willingly ignore things just to maintain a relationship? When Ellie accepts Joel's answer, she is making the choice to live with the lie. 10 years from now she may feel differently, but not at this moment.<br />
<br />
The ending isn't supposed to make you feel &quot;fullfilled&quot;. It's supposed to make you confused. Clearly, you don't like endings like this. Usually, I agree, but for some reason I find this one satisfying. The only &quot;miss&quot; the game makes in the ending, imo, is not giving the player the choice to save Ellie or save humanity. I think another ending where Joel is in the room and sees the doctor and just tells Ellie good-bye and then leaves would have been nice. And then a cut-scene of Joel 20 years later at the end of his life and nothing has changed. He didn't save Ellie and it didn't save humanity. 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
As for Joel mowing down enemies, unfortunately that's the one limitation to video game story telling. Games still have to be fun to play. Otherwise, you'd just be watching a movie. I'm willing to give a little bit of leeway with this aspect in order to be entertained.</blockquote>

For the record, The Great Gatsby was simply the first thing that popped into my head, probably because of the movie and the recent threads about it. I think the point still stands though. Video games typically cater to our fantasies and try to make us happy. The most appreciated literature most definitely does not do this, which is why so many people find it hard to read in comparison to &quot;escapism&quot; entertainment. Sometimes it's about the characters more than it is about the plotting itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think I do empathize with that feeling, however, as I think I've had it before. When you are just so incredibly offended because something didn't give you that one thing you needed. For the life of me I can't think of the words to ease that feeling. :(</blockquote>

I thought the entire game was simply amazing.  It was easily one of the best I've played.  Naughty Dog is one of the best game companies out there right now and they always seem to deliver quality games.  As for the ending, I thought it was solid and I liked it.  In my mind Joel didn't always like Ellie but he felt that he owed her and needed to protect her.  Especially after Super Ellie saved his life.  Not to mention he lost Sarah in the first 10 minutes of the game and wasn't about to lose Ellie too.  Ultimately he's, generally, a good guy but he's also a selfish character.<br />
<br />
With that being said, there were parts of the ending sequence I didn't care for (Ramboing my way through the Hospital) and I think they could have done a better job of presenting that.  And, yes, it was stupid that they didn't restrain him better but I don't hate the game's outcome.</blockquote>

</div>If it's honestly Ellie's choice to give up, then they need to <i>show</i> that. My point isn't that it's unrealistic for people to make shitty choices, it's that there is NO FOUNDATION for the choices made by the characters in the end game. Especially when it comes to Ellie. And while real life can be dull and meander without point, I think it fairly obvious that stories that are dull and meander without point are just poorly written. Again, there are a lot of directions they could have gone with the ending and made me happy, but they chose none of them, and it just kind of meandered to a close. If you were going to do that, why not just make the game about Joel and Ellie and get rid of all this &quot;save the world&quot; nonsense in the first place?<br />
<br />
As someone who wants to make a living telling stories, then I have to flat disagree with you that a confusing ending is okay; you can embolden a reader, you can drive them to despair, you can leave them with a hollow emptiness of guilt or wracked with fear. But to just leave them confused as to what happened? That's flat out piss poor storytelling, and it means you did something wrong. The fact that that sort of ending gets hailed as Awesome is a strong indicator that storytelling in games as a whole has gotten pretty staid and tired, absolutely. There's just danger in telling developers that it's okay to make crappy endings just because they're new and different.<br />
<br />
I could make a fairly easy comparison between Last of Us and Mass Effect 3, honestly. Both games left me restless and vaguely frustrated after the ending, but the feelings had everything to do with a story left unfinished and shot full of holes than that feeling being the actual point of the writers. The difference is that the gaming community rose up against ME3's ending and (correctly) labeled it as poor quality, whereas Last of Us receives full marks. The difference in reaction has everything to do with the type of game; ME3 is full of player choices and so the players feel cheated by a cop-out ending. Last of Us has no choice whatsoever and so players don't feel cheated, they just shrug and accept things at face value because they don't have a say in the matter.<br />

</div>&quot;Daring&quot; would be making the flat statement that it's totally okay to kill one person in the name of saving humanity (How many shows/movies/games push that sort of message? A scant handful?). Daring might also be saying that &quot;Yes, Joel is a selfish bastard for doing this but that's life, sucks to be human.&quot; I would call the ending of Last of Us different, but I wouldn't call it daring. Or perhaps it is daring in the same way that the art installation which is a competent study canvas slashed into strips is, because it is &quot;edgy&quot; or whatever. Again, I don't -want- the standard pleasure of a happy ending. I want the cold wrench of despair at having to lose this child who you have shepherded through this entire game, the anger and deep sadness of grief that her life is cut short, contrasted against the stark reality of the situation. That's not happy, nor is it pleasurable, and Joel can either accept the choice or be broken upon it. The fact that they wasted the potential of the setup they created is what bothers me the most.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I just see it completely different from you Atelen. I don't think the ending was confusing (even though I think I might have used that word, poor word choice). Maybe ambivalent would have been better. I think you get to see Ellie make the choice to not care when she doesn't press Joel on her question at the end. I agree with your comparison to ME3 and the reason people have different opinions, although ME3 almost universally had a negative response where the vast majority of reactions to The Last of Us has been positive. I would say that ME3, besides running counter to the choices of the rest of the game, actually was far more confusing than The Last of Us. We know exactly what they are going to do after the game is over.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one.</blockquote>

In writing, there is a clear period in the sentence, but when she reads it, the actress reads it as a comma.  Reading it one way versus the other drastically alters the meaning.  If its a comma, they've run this experiment before.  If it's a period, they've been experimenting on normal infected.</blockquote>

</div>To me, the &quot;cure&quot; was always about minimizing the risk for the survivors. Without advanced technology and weaponry, how do you hope to wipe out the infected if a single bite or some spores are a death sentence?</blockquote>

<br />
The important part of the Infected is that they eventually die.  They go through their stages, and at some point they become spore clouds.  None of the groups of humans were shown to really have a problem with the Infected, they had problems when they went outside to scavenge.  If you remove the need to scavenge, and migrate to cleanup, you solve the problem.  Decades later if/when someone got infected, they would be put down fairly quickly by everyone around them holding weapons and handcuffs.  Oh, you might be infected?  Well lets just handcuff your wrist and ankle together and wait it out.</blockquote>
