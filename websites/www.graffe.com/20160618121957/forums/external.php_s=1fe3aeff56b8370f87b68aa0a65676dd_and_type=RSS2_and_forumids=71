			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've been distracted and a bit negligent this year. This might be a weird year for E3. Several publishers have decided to not attend, and last I checked (admittedly it wasn't recently) no one knew quite what to expect. People started getting excited when Sony and Microsoft hinted at a hardware revision, but then both companies said they wouldn't have anything ready yet. Sony still hasn't released their VR, so I guess we can expect more of that. Nintendo has outright said there will be no NX this year, despite it launching next spring. In fact, they have said the only thing they are going to show is the Wii U version of the next Zelda game.<br />
<br />
The event lasts from the 14th to the 16th next week. EA is having their own event starting today (the 12th) and ending on the 14th. <br />
<br />
Press Conferences: EA and Bethesda Sunday (today), Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft on Monday. Finally Nintendo will do whatever it is they are doing on Tuesday. <br />
<br />
A few of the games we can expect:<br />
<br />
Titanfall 2<br />
Watchdogs 2 (recently announced)<br />
Zelda Wii U<br />
Dishonored 2<br />
Deus Ex<br />
Battlefield 1<br />
Call of Duty<br />
Persona 5<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think I have much in the way of predictions this year. I haven't been keeping up with the industry as much lately. There are plenty of already announced titles to revisit, so no need to list them all.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned above, Nintendo is only showing off Zelda on the show floor. The good news is that after years of nothing we will get as much Zelda coverage as we could possibly want. No NX is weird, but they clearly don't want to distract from their last big Wii U title. They don't want the fact that it is coming out on NX too to cannibalize sales. I think it would be strange if they don't at least show some of the other already announced Wii U and 3DS stuff in their online press conference though.<br />
<br />
I think we will finally see the new God of War at Sony. The fan uproar for Crash is getting louder every year, but I can't imagine what they could possibly do to that franchise to make it relevant today. Last Guardian needs to hurry up and come out. VR support for No Man's Sky to justify the delay. (unless they already said it was manufacturing problems) More Horizon Zero Dawn (or whatever they renamed it). <br />
<br />
I've got no real insight on Microsoft. Gears and Crackdown need to be almost ready by now, so maybe they will get a big showing.<br />
<br />
EA we know we are getting a ton of Titanfall news. Maybe Mass Effect? Maybe one of those EA Star Wars games? They've got two going now, the third person shooter being made by Visceral and a recently announced third person action game by Respawn.<br />
<br />
Bethesda: the only thing I could possibly think of is Dishonored 2. Is that worth an entire press conference?<br />
<br />
Ubisoft: Year after year they continually have the best surprises. A few of those surprises are yet to come out, so we should see more from them. Also Watch Dogs.<br />
<br />
Note that Persona 5 recently had a Japanese event confirming their release date (pretty close to FF15 in fact). There is a good chance it isn't coming out in the West until spring of next year, judging based on the amazon listing for the collector's edition (which I don't even remember seeing announced). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll post trailers and impressions whenever I find time to watch them this year.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>June is a bit of a dull month for releases, especially compared to last month. There was actually a fair bit of faff that I wasn't sure if I should even list in the spoiler tag, let alone mention in this post itself. Console ports of PC indie games, for example. If I overlooked something that people might want to hear about, let us know!<br />
<br />
The biggest game this month is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOe3ik_RViE" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Mirror's Edge: Catalyst</b></a>, or at least it is the game with the most potential. The first game was an experiment in non-traditional game design: a first person runner/platformer that emphasized movement and avoiding conflict, rather than shooting your way out of situations. It was a hard sell, and performed poorly as a result. Years of being a cult classic that few people actually enjoyed seems to have encouraged EA to try again. As practically the only AAA game this month, it will be interesting to see if it does any better this time.<br />
<br />
Aside from that there isn't too much, though this is a decent month if you you like Japanese rpgs. We've got two fairly big ones this month (though not the biggest). First up, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG0U77AA0X4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness</b></a>. I sort of find the art style to be incredibly garish, but these games tend to have pretty interesting combat systems. Here's hoping the everything else isn't as obnoxious this time.<br />
<br />
The Wii U is also getting a fairly major release with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpVhoHMcRD8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Toyko Mirage Sessions #FE</b></a>. This is actually the Fire Emblem X Shin Megami Tensei (the world Persona is derived from) crossover. Potential fans were originally disappointed when the crossover ended up being some weird pop idol rpg, with the Fire Emblem characters essentially being Persona summons for the main characters. The game has also been deemed too niche to be worth an English dub, yet Nintendo is going through the trouble of changing other things about the localization, inciting nerd outrage across the internet (par for the course with Nintendo localizations). Regardless, it is being made by Atlus and should be good if you don't die from embarrassment while playing it.<br />
<br />
Rounding up the Japanese role-playing games this month are a port/remake of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h7_RuKZ-Y8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Odin Sphere</b></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqzYVolKua8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Atelier Sophie</b></a>, the next entry in a long line of rpgs that focus on crafting as much as combat.<br />
<br />
Handhelds get a couple of interesting releases this month. The 3DS gets <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwg5H6p3Mfo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Kirby: Planet Robobot</b></a>, and both the 3DS and the Vita get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etz9m5RApxo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Zero Time Dilemma</b></a>, the final entry in the Zero Escape (9 Persons 9 Hours 9 Doors, Virtue's Last Reward) series. I've mentioned these before. They are mystery/puzzle adventure games. A number of people are kidnapped, put in a dungeon, and have to solve puzzles to escape, while trying to figure out who the killer is. These games usually force the player into uncomfortable moral dilemmas. Do you condemn someone to save yourself, or risk letting them do the same to you?<br />
<br />
This particular entry in the series has left behind it's visual novel roots, and instead has voiced cutscenes, in an attempt to reach a larger audience, though I wonder if they have the budget to do it effectively. Each game also has a different hook, and this one is trying to duplicate television mystery shows. You choose a scene with no context as to when it takes place in the story (the characters themselves don't know either). As you play through the game and solve the mysteries, you gradually put together the timeline of events. This particular entry in the series is also being released on PC but I've seen no mention of ports of the older games. While each game is relatively stand alone, there is a thread that connects the games together, especially in this one judging by the cast.<br />
<br />
Finally, if you aren't interested in any of these Japanese games, the PC is getting a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGTMxjL1ED0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Hearts of Iron</b></a> grand strategy game, a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0IJqIzO_YM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Lego Star Wars (Force Awakens)</b></a> is out on everything, and a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egw4K8to9d0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b>Sherlock Holmes</b></a> mystery adventure game is coming out on PC/PS4/X1. I played the previous in this series and it was fairly decent.<br />

It's pretty interesting and feels like it could have MineCraftian potential with some work and polish.</div>
