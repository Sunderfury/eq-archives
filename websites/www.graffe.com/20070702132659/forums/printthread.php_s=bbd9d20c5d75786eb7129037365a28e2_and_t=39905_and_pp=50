		<div>I've always thought that they should consider extending the differences between the elements when they came out with the damage flappys.  And especially now since they came out with Pyromancy.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they could introduce some competing abilitys to Pyromancy:<br />
<br />
For Pyromancy, there's a chance to cause more damage via the fire dot.<br />
<br />
Perhaps for cold there could be a chance to slow a monsters attack speed, or snare or root <br />
<br />
For magic, it could be a short stun effect.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like to see them revise the flappys somewhat, so that you can focus on specilializing more to an element and don't feel like you need to be constantly switching between the different varieties.  Perhaps where the 2nd rank of a particular flappy would give the first rank boost of the other elemental varieties, and so on.  I'd rather they get rid of the mana regen line of flappys completely and apply the respective mana regen bonuses to each rank of the elemental flappy's.<br />

		<div>1) Please give us a prismatic focus flappy with some decent mana regen. - even a mana-expensive spell rather than AA would be acceptable.<br />
<br />
2) It's been asked for before, but some MGB TL capabilities would be nice.<br />
<br />
3) An AA or spell that lets the wizard port his group to his secondary bind would be SO cool.<br />
<br />
4) A single-target, long-duration snare is long overdue.<br />
<br />
5) Group-based improved invis.<br />
<br />
6) A cool magic nuke along the lines of Chaos Flame or Claw of Vox to make magic nukes more viable than they currently are.  Chaos Flame is incredibly nice because it's an excellent complement to Pyromancy.  CoV is nice because it's incredibly efficient.  There's rarely, if ever a good reason to cast magic nukes.<br />
<br />
7) Gadget spell: I'd really like to see a spell that's fast-casting, fast refresh that would blip a wizard a fixed distance (say 200) feet at a time along the lines of shadow step, but this one would accelerate the wizard in the direction he's already facing.  It would be a kind of warp to complement a wizard's mastery of travel through time and space.  Normal restrictions apply: must stay on Z axis, can't warp through walls, etc.  It would be fun to use this in places like the Karanas where the distances are entirely too long.<br />
<br />
8) AA &quot;Meditative Mastery&quot;; 5 levels; 5/5/5/5/5:  Each level obtained in Meditative Mastery will allow a wizard who is standing still to gain 20% of his meditation skill as though he were sitting.<br />
  - this would go a long way in addressing the fact that wizards are the most sensitive class in the game where it comes to mana availability in areas where horses aren't permitted.</div>

Maybe a group version of the Bard Fade that causes in place evac.  I would like to see the mob pushed back to his bind though.  For this kind of thing I would say I don't want it to be immediately reusable for exploit reasons, but I think it could be a Very useful item.  Bard fade is controlled by consuming decent mana and having absolute crap for mana regen.  Wizards should have something similar.  I don't know what would be the best idea to control this other than maybe Endurance, but we need to find a way that a lack of endurance is a detriment to us other than just this spell.  Maybe tie the Harvests into Endurance so we have to balance Aggro with the ability to save the group?<br />
<br />
Not sure, but I also say I like the ideas above.</div>

		<div>Meditative Trance - self only, drastically increases Mana regen (+50 mana regen, which  doubles for every tick the wizard is in trance...tick 1 +50, tick 2 +100, tick 3 +200...etc...) at the cost of taking the wizard out of combat (this trance state breaks as soon as you cast a spell or you are attacked) ...possibly also costs endurance , same ratio as the mana regen factor..ie: tick 1: -50 end, tick 2 -100 end, tick 3: -200 end...ec...<br />
<br />
<br />
Planar shift - a wizard version of rogue escape with a somewhat longer resue timer than the rogue ability, wizard fades from mob's view (secondary effect is Improved invis, so once aggro is wiped if mob doesnt see invis you dont get back on hate list unless you do something...like cast on the mob or drop the invis), causes aggro wipe of 20% per level, 5 levels cost 3/6/9/12/15 ?  level 5 = 100% aggro wipe<br />
<br />
Group version of planar shift - see above, only it works on the entire group, much longer reuse timer (1 day maybe?)<br />
<br />
Perfected Invisibility (Shield of Imperceptability?) - self only, fixed timer (20 mins?), same level of invis as rogue SoS (ie: regular see-invis mobs can't see you, but see-Sos mobs can), min level req 75 or 80?<br />
<br />
Familiar scout (eye of tallon spell with familiar graphic, basically a controllable familiar that you see through its eyes, level1 = 3 mins fixed / level 2 = 5 mins fixed / level 3 = 7 mins fixed duration (random durations suck)<br />
<br />
just for fun - voice graft for the familiar...hehehe<br />
<br />
Aura of the Familiar -  Aura spell that allows all in the vicinity to get the Familiar's resists and mana regen / manapool buff, higher levels would be: <br />
Aura of the Greater familiar, Aura of the Devoted Familiar</div>

		<div>Harvest Extension:<br />
<br />
How about a Harvest like ability or spell that works something like a reverse mana dot.  So, say 250 mana to cast, and the longer it's on the more mana you recieve, start small and increase, kind of like the progressive dots on the Shaman and Druid 1.0 epics.  make it just pay for the 250 mana over the first 3 - 4 ticks, but the longer it lasts, the more mana you get.  Also make it like Scale of the Wolf where if you get hit, it drops.  Also make it so that if you cast it drops.  This way it would prevent us from having some form of limitless mana while in combat, but give us a reasonable way to fill back up the tank without waiting for 7-10 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Chaotic Stun<br />
<br />
A random duration stun 1 - 30 seconds would be fun.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Snare<br />
<br />
This spell line has been neglected for far too long.  Wizards are expected to snare in groups, why can't we get something that lasts a while or has a better resist modifier or is a single target snare?  I had one of the zone in goblins in Stillmoon resist snare EIGHT snare casts this morning.  That's just wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Summoning Mobs,<br />
<br />
There are few, if any classes as impacted by this game mechanic as Wizards.  Weak in the armor/hp department, no DA ability, no pet to depend on for agro and DPS, no healing capabilities.  If it summons our stuns likely won't stick.  Soloing Summoning mobs worth soloing is out of the question, unlike almost every other class.  In a group situation it changes the amount of burn we can put down before we are in mortal danger.  Somewhere along the line most mobs that a group will be doing moved to being a summoning mobs.  An anti summoning Aura, or short duration quick casting long recast spell that you could drop prior to going into a burn mode, a lure based stun or two, something to give us the ability to really go all out when called for.  Anyone ever remember stealing agro in a positive way back in the day?  <br />
<br />
Healer is lom, tank is getting low, you're in full burn, the mob starts walking at you instead of finishing of the tank who isn't going to get a heal for another 10 seconds.  Those were fun, exciting and important capabilities we lost when group mobs became summoning mobs.</div>

		<div>some ideas strange but maybe usefull<br />
<br />
AA eye of zome spell no fade duration when clicked off will transport group to eyes last location. Eye has lockpick skill to open doors . This eye is also non targetable by pc and npc so it cant be prematurly triggered by trigger happy players.<br />
<br />
reuse 10 hours <br />
<br />
used correctly this spell can allow a wizard to bypass doors and transport group to a designated area in a zone like mage coh but its a one shot use every 5 or 10 hours not over usable.<br />
<br />
<br />
2 main areas wizards need improvement cast time and mana usage some ideas <br />
<br />
I would eventually like to one day see a aa that would give wizards a short duration of having the ability to instant cast spells. This would go a long way to make us viable to save  groups again in bad overpull situations. <br />
<br />
wizards should have an innate ablility to draw out magical effects in objects and enhance existing magical effects or supress them in enemies.<br />
<br />
1) wizards spell or aa ability to increase proc rates to 100 or 200% for a limited time to draw out magical effects in weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) aa to share spell effects with group ie gift of mana and mana wieve              benificial effects.<br />
<br />
3) wizard ability to limit or supress proc effects or increase the space                between a mobs detrimental effect casts basicaly a caster based slow for      wizards will increase the cast time to spells or extend the recast timer on      mobs. <br />
<br />
a new dimension to wizards possibly add a tracking type ability in the furture the idea of out eye line was to allow us to see mobs from far away but game mechanics make this line really useless <br />
<br />
If we could have the in game map show mobs when we cast a scying type spell this would be a huge boost to the wizard class as a raid tool to see if mobs are up to be killed.<br />
<br />
percentage raid damage spells <br />
bane type spells based on mobs with massive hitpoints these spells are flagged to only operate on mobs over a minimum hit point range.<br />
<br />
mobs with over a miillon hp would have a 2% to 3%  damage nuke.<br />
<br />
New disintigrate upgrade spell wizards should have this spell still as a means to controle over pull mobs up to level 65 at the very least possible even up .higher to 68.<br />
<br />
<br />
a new long duration single taget snare. <br />
<br />
new kiting spells.<br />
<br />
chain lightning <br />
nuke that has a sticky or bounce type effect.<br />
mana cost 1000<br />
hits mob for 200 damage as long as mobs are grouped together the nuke begins to bounce from mob to mob untill it kills a mob or is resisted. <br />
<br />
<br />
retune or revamp sword amimations to have better damge output but still be weak in terms of taking mele damage maybe make a 2nd line of animations for wizards. High DPS but a timed duration with a unresistable proc effect. <br />
<br />
<br />
Travel upgrade abilities <br />
<br />
using map system to allow us to port by dropping a marker in map mode to a specified location make it a AA ability and possible pop a ae teleport to the raid your in to go to that location.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
end the cookie cuter syndrome of EQ <br />
<br />
customizable spell effect give us the ablility to not only upgrade our spell effects with focus items that we wear but also give us the ability to add mod effects to spells in the game instead of only auging gear we wear allow us to unmemorize spells and and auguments to them. <br />
<br />
Adding a strikethrough effect to nukes <br />
adding a cirtical modifyer to spells<br />
adding a mana reduction modifyer to nukes<br />
adding a aggro reduction mod to spells.<br />
<br />
customized spells <br />
 open reaserch up to have the ability to create new spells <br />
<br />
true north + yonder rip them appart and pull out the effects to port at yonders distance in the direction you face. creating a new travel spell.<br />
<br />
Game mechanics issues ok you gave bards and rangers and any other ranged class the ability to either auto cast ie melody or auto dps ie autofire.<br />
<br />
GIve us autocast ability to auto cycle a set of nukes on a raid. There are many wizards that are boxed on raids and this added function would be a great help to any boxed wizards. <br />
<br />
and if any of you start screaming this takes the skill out of the class the skill level of eq has been dropping for years no reason not to give wizards the same auto damage ability as other classes get.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wizard eppic effect - i really dont understand why no one really tried to be more vocal about our crappy effect on the 1.5 and 2.0 staff<br />
<br />
this effect is a joke compared to other classes this should really be reviewed and changes made to make it more in line with other classes eppics. <br />
<br />
TO me the eppic should have the following effects <br />
<br />
casting the eppic should summon a familiar that has a set duration this familiar should cast a effect on us doing 2 things <br />
<br />
1) change the current minor % based effect to a -1000 on resists to spells <br />
2) either change our crit % rate while under the eppic effect or make the familiar that pops when the eppic is triggered shadow cast whatever spell we cast. similar to the nuking mage aa familiar but ours would copy our spell casts.<br />
<br />
this 3rd part is for 2.0<br />
3) as the pet dies he does a dragon roar effect this will add a mana/endurance heal over time to the group for 10 ticks you get 200/200  end/mana a tick.</div>

		<div>AAs<br />
<br />
I guess first, general type AAs:<br />
<br />
An AA that allows us to carry two more tier 1 inventory slots (bag spaces).  There are an increasingly enormous number of clickies, potions, reagents, junk etc that need to be carried around today.  This should probably be given as a part of the expansion, but if not, add them as AAs.<br />
<br />
Innate Ultravision.  I don't really care, I play a dark elf wizard.  I have never worried about it, but I know many other people have.  If somehow miraculously you can gain the innate ability to see invisible things, you ought to be able to see in the dark.<br />
<br />
Hit us with another spell gem, can always find something to throw in there.<br />
<br />
Wizard type AAs:<br />
<br />
Cold based version of pyromancy.  300ish damage per tick, 30% slow.  Skip the snare part, it makes too many mobs immune to the slow part that goes along with effects like clinging frost.  30% slow is the equivalent of like a level 30 shaman.  It isn't much, but better than nothing.<br />
<br />
Magic Based version of pyromancy.  400ish damage per tick, 0 sec stun each tick.<br />
<br />
(My thoughts on pyromancy-like effects:  Each effect should give damage and provide some type of utility.  The exchange for such is a cost in agro.  This is just my opinion though, tweak as necessary to fit the individuals view on agro vs utility.)<br />
<br />
Upgrades to harvests.  Don't give us a new harvest, just AAs that increase the returns on the ones we have by 25/50/100%.<br />
<br />
Spell strikethrough.<br />
<br />
Increased chance to proc spell effects such as pyromancy, gift of mana and weave of power.<br />
<br />
Fire mastery.  +100/200/400 to base damage of fire spells.<br />
<br />
Ice mastery.  +50/100/250 to base damage of ice spells.<br />
<br />
Magic mastery.  +75/150/300 to base damage of magic spells.<br />
<br />
Improved spell casting subtlety.  Hopefully at least another 10% reduction.  (side note: Freaking fix SCS and concussion/mind crash already, it's been 2 years as &quot;other things have higher priority&quot;.  That's ridiculous, change the code so that it calculates the number, assigns it an absolute value and then makes the value negative.  Trust us, it won't be that huge of a thing that wizards will get a little kicker to concussion from that.)<br />
<br />
An AA that extends rains to four, then five pulses.  (side note:  Allow all our spells to be focused by damage modifiers please.  It's no more overpowering than the huge focii that necromancers get for their DoTs, and rains are much more cumbersome to use than DoT's.)<br />
<br />
New lines of familiars.  Primary familiar should be at least 15 mana per tick regen.  Do whatever amount of focus effect on the damage ones that is appropriate.<br />
<br />
An AA that shares familiar effects with the group would be nice, but that would be like an aura I suppose.<br />
<br />
Fix Strong Root.  36 minute refresh on it after spending all those AAs, and then giving shaman a poison based root with knockback refreshing every 3 minutes for much less is pretty unbalancing for price paid in AAs.  Don't nerf them, fix us.<br />
<br />
Some type of DPS &quot;discipline&quot; type AA to compliment FD/PD.  For instance, 36 minute refresh time, when used locks out FD/PD as well (this isn't quite right, I have to think about how to make it work better).  The effect would be:  For1 minute, all spells cost half mana.  The thinking behind this:  on a 72 minute timer, you would be able to use Prolonged Destruction to cause a great deal of damage at the sacrifice of mana (short burst fights), and then you would also be able to use this other Efficiency Based AA on a DIFFERENT fight to extend how long you could maintain a normal burn (sustained DPS fights).  I didn't explain this perfectly, but I hope someone gets the point.<br />
<br />
For my own crazy invention AA/spell:  I would like to see an AA/spell that allows a temporary (5 minute) bind.  This would allow you to drop the temporary bind, run and grab something/someone you forgot etc, and then come right back.  Would also allow abscond to become a semi-viable agro dropping tool in exchange for giving up the loading time for zoning.  Probably would need a decently long refresh timer (30 minutes maybe?).<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
<br />
Only going into Utility here, since damage spells will most likely be scaled however the developers want anyways to fit &quot;class balance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Time for a new snare spell, we're 9 expansions out of date on ours.<br />
<br />
I like the Spellshield for DoTs idea.  Also time for a new spellshield, it is 7 expansions out of date.<br />
<br />
Group invisibility.  Plane shift by it's name sounds well within the wizards capability to make the whole group invisible, so let's make it so.  [Side note, let's drop the group only invisibility rule.  The reason it was placed in game (griefing of pet classes) has been fixed.]<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of for now.  My last plea would be to not take these ideas and hand them out to other classes after we come up with them.  Like spell haste given to clerics, mana flare given to enchanters, group mana regeneration kicker given to enchanters (PoR aura is the group familiar idea presented here months ago).  All those other classes already have much more to offer to a group already than we do.  Please don't take the utility that could be given to wizards and farm it away to other classes again.</div>

(*necros can leech form an cast with 60+ ft , so giving us somthing that just requires us not to move/cast for say 2-4mins for full mana wouldent be to bad.)</div>

My mana pool is just about 14k.  So this harvest would return 3500.  That is ten times what harvest returns now.  And assuming the refresh timer stays the same, that makes it roughly 40 mana per tick.  I think that's a bit excessive, don't you?<br />

Seriously, it is suggestions like these that make people think we are whiners.  There is no way that we would get any of these things.  Your first item, a 50% reduction in aggro is insane!  If we are lucky we'll get a 5% reduction for 50 AAs.  Double crits, zero mana, 1000% increases in harvest.  This is asking for the moon.</div>

PD is not an aa to increase crit rates ? And all along thats what I thought it was.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, do you actually subscribe to the masochistic mindset that a burst discipline should lower your total damage output? Because that is what pd does atm. That is the double standard that no other class who has a burst discipline endures. <br />
<br />
In every other case a burst discipline increases your dps temporarily while having that extra damage ADD to the damage that would have occured if no disc was used. <br />
<br />
<br />
PD otoh, lowers our total damage by a large amount while offering us a mere 40% greater chance to crit. The above suggestion is completely justified.</div>

Of course I do, I also realize that Vishimtar cloak is 50%, and Vampiric Fire is 60%. What i'm talking about is the added damage that Ro's/Eci's/Druzzil's greater familiar also adds, so instead of having to switch between currently 4 diffrent familiar's. It could all be jumbled into 1, as a prismatic and instead of the current 25% we currently get off of 1 spell focus familiar. We would get 50%, which in my opinion would give us the edge again in burst parses.<br />

That's the idea, while I would like to see a permanant version of it. That would indeed be a bit overpowering in my opinion, but I would be happy with a version of it without a penalty to further extend our use in burn fights even without a timer reduction. But the timer reduction would be nice, maybe time between fights increases even more in Deathkneel and Demiplane of Blood. But right now in Anguish the averege time for my guild between bosses is about 25 minutes roughly.<br />

				<div style="font-style:italic">My mana pool is just about 14k.  So this harvest would return 3500.  That is ten times what harvest returns now.  And assuming the refresh timer stays the same, that makes it roughly 40 mana per tick.  I think that's a bit excessive, don't you?</div>

Not in the least, how fast do we burn thru 3500 mana even with the best mana preservation items availble? Keep in my mind not every Wizard out there has my 13.6k or your 14k(buffed lead aa's etc?). So thier return would be less for say a casual or lower end Wizard raider.<br />

Makes me happy in the pants just thinking about it. It's okay though, the rogues,berserkers and monks will pass us 5-10 minutes later on long fights. Which most of the high end fights are from what i've gathered. Past Demiplane of Blood.<br />

Yeah it is, would be nice now wouldn't it. As long as it proc'd more often than not, I would be happy with it. In it's current form for me at least, it lowers my DPS not increases it. And is for the most part for me at least, nothing more than a spell to make spell crit eyecandy with. Sometimes it'll proc 3 times in a row (Rarley), and most of the time i'll use it 5-6 times before I see a proc.<br />

		<div>Ok, I only skimmed the thread but I'll throw in my 2 cents, and as a bonus I'll give the devs an idea of where I am and my guild's progression in an attempt to give them a better idea of where I am coming from.<br />
Level: 70<br />
AA: ~400<br />
Guild Progression: Working through CoA named but have not gotten to MataMuram yet, Killed Yar'Lir, can clear all of Tacvi<br />
<br />
1.  I want an upgrade to Improved Invis.  Self target only, an AA that can match the apilities of Rogue's Shroud of Stealth.  Short reuse timer say 15 mins.  Could also make it snare ME for balance.  Make it long duration too say 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
2. I like the idea of a MGB type AA that lets me TL an entire raid to any TL spell I have.  Could even make it take the same number of portal stones as the number of people in range.  Would provide some kind of limitation to it.<br />
<br />
3. I want a MUCH upgraded Mind Crash.  Shorter reuse timer, more agro reduction, even faster cast time.<br />
<br />
4. Along the same lines I would like to see an AA (with a long reuse timer say 72 mins) that lets me &quot;mega&quot; Mind Crash a mob and remove ALL agro it has on me.  So if I get agro running somewhere I have the option of rooting/snaring it and wiping me off it's agro list totally.  This would obviously help in a raid, maybe too much, so you could limit it to only work on a mob that has NOT been damaged by anyone.<br />
<br />
5.  Ability to take a group to my Secondary bind point like Teleport Bind to primary bind point.</div>

That's all I can think of for now.  My last plea would be to not take these ideas and hand them out to other classes after we come up with them.  Like spell haste given to clerics, mana flare given to enchanters, group mana regeneration kicker given to enchanters (PoR aura is the group familiar idea presented here months ago).  All those other classes already have much more to offer to a group already than we do.  Please don't take the utility that could be given to wizards and farm it away to other classes again.</div>

		<div>I didn't mean to be insulting, but all of those suggestions were pretty much unreasonable.  Only &quot;Hastened Prolonged destruction, reduces the the reuse to 36 minutes at the top rank&quot; is something that could be implemented, and that is without the &quot;Mastery&quot; AA.<br />
<br />
They already said that new AAs are going to be based on the Gates model, small increases for a high cost.  Don't think of 50%.  Think of five levels of 1% boost each, for 10 AAs per level.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm sure we'll see some of that as part of the level increase.  A new familiar would make sense.  More mana, and hp of course.</div>

		<div>I have readen many nice things in these posts.<br />
<br />
My whishes :<br />
<br />
<b>1) Please give us diversity ! </b><br />
<br />
In the past, when we had to choose between alternatives, it has usually been a waste (specialization: we all took the same, Gods : you see what I mean , faction : we don t care but maybe cov/geant long ago, DoN side : even evil classes are on &quot;good&quot; side mostly).<br />
<br />
But I still like the idea of diversity for a given class. I would like to see a choice between lines of AA, balanced enough so not all players take the same one.<br />
Some ideas : not sure about the content, just examples :<br />
<br />
Line &quot;efficiency&quot; :<br />
- less mana cost // decap evocation<br />
- less resist<br />
- an AA with free mana low DD (1000 damage) with low reuse time<br />
<br />
Line &quot;damages&quot; :<br />
- bonus on DD<br />
- bonus on critik rate<br />
- an AA with free mana high DD (5000 damage) with long reuse time<br />
<br />
Line &quot;subltlety&quot; :<br />
- less agro (must be noticeable)<br />
- fixed IvU or rogue's like sos<br />
- an AA with free mana dot <br />
<br />
A hard long boring quest would allow a change of choice after you made one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>2) Mana burn/blaze</b><br />
<br />
Wizard still like the flashy big boum :)<br />
<br />
- Would like an AA with a little chance (1% ?) to critik on manablaze/burn<br />
- Would like line of AA with a little chance (5%?) to lower mana cost, or get a random capped cost for same damage</div>

		<div>I see mainly 3 pillars that need work for Wizards: Mana Regen, Hate reduction and Damage output.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen:<br />
<br />
- Fix the orignal Harvest versions or create a new version e.g. Harvest of Ro (3/6/9) 500/750/1000 mana, recast 5 minutes, cast time 10 sec, no stun component<br />
- Upgrade our Familiars with Mana regen - Devoted Familiar should be upped to 15 Mana per tick if not even 18 - the Foci Familiars should be upped to 8 mana per tick<br />
<br />
Hate reduction:<br />
<br />
2 possibilities...<br />
a.) A new Concussion (name idea: &quot;Oblivion&quot;) spell which should decrease hate by 1000 else same cast time and mana cost as AGC (2 secs / 25 mana)<br />
or...<br />
b.) Lower the reuse of Mind Crash significantly down to 9 minutes - something like &quot;Advanced Hastened Mind Crash&quot; (6/9/12), lowers the reuse time of the Hastened Mind Crash by further 25% per rank.<br />
This would have more impact on long duration fights where you build up significant aggro overtime<br />
<br />
- Fix the Silent Casting at last level from random to a certain guaranteed Hate reduction in the range of at least 70%+<br />
<br />
I personally would prefer a new Concussion spell overall since it would have generally more impact and utility<br />
<br />
Damage Output:<br />
<br />
- &quot;Advanced Quick Damage&quot; (3/6/9), Lowers the casting time of all your damage spells by 5%,10% and 15%<br />
- &quot;Prismatic Focus&quot; (5/10), lowers the resist modifier on all your damage spells by 50 and 100<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
- Up the damage of Mana Weave and Gelidin Comet to same base damage as Corona Flare. This would give us more of a freedom which to use<br />
- &quot;Freeze&quot; (3/6/9), same as Pyromancy just for Cold based spells<br />
- As for new damage spell in the next expansion &quot;Frost Strike&quot; (or whatever name) with around same base damage as Ether Flame<br />
<br />
<br />
General Utility<br />
<br />
- &quot;Project Teleport&quot; (10), after activation your next Translocate spell will send all players in range to the destination of your Translocate, same mods as regular Teleport<br />
- Spell:Second Recall Teleport, sends all players in range to your Secondary Bind spot, same mods as regular Teleport<br />
<br />
<br />
So as summary for the upcomming expansion:<br />
New Spells: Oblivion, Frost Strike, Second Recall Teleport<br />
New AAs: Harvest of Ro, Advanced Quick Damage, Prismatic Focus, Freeze, Project Teleport<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp on the matter.<br />

		<div><b>Spellcasting Overhaste</b><br />
A one minute duration group buff which acts to supplement the current line of cleric spellhaste spells.<br />
It would work to do so by reducing the recast timer by a percentage (25%) for spells <i>where recast timer is less than 180</i>.<br />
<br />
A buff like this is great for two reasons. It would be highly coveted by wizards wanting to do better burst dps. And it would also be highly coveted by all casters, healers, knights, caster dps as well. <br />
<br />
So this gives us utility and yet remains focused on improving our damage capability.<br />
<br />
Standard recast is 2.25 secs. with 25% recast lowered that comes down to 1.6875secs. Heals come sooner. Dps goes up.<br />
<br />
DPS on Ancient Core Fire chained.<br />
If someone's regular setup has them casting acf in 5.5 secs unfocused <br />
With  0% recast reduction, we're getting 525 dps.<br />
With 20% recast reduction, that's up to 558 dps.<br />
With 25% recast reduction, that's up to 566 dps.</div>

		<div>An idea I had, reposted from a discussion in another topic thread:<br />
<br />
How about a Wizard gets a nuke that does 500 DD. When cast, it places a buff in the target's buff box that indicates &quot;Level One&quot; of that spell. Next time the Wizard casts the same DD spell, it does 1K DD, and the buff is overwritten with a buff indicating &quot;Level Two&quot; of that spell. If the target has the Level Two icon and is hit by the same spell, it does 2K DD and the buff is overwritten with a &quot;Level Three&quot; icon. Put in five levels, and the spell would do up to 16K per nuke, but no crit capacity or focus will work (like the old dragon/giantbane nukes). Or four levels for up to 8K per nuke, but with the normal crit/focus capacity. At max level, the buff would become ablative, meaning it would fade after being nuked with that same spell.<br />
<br />
That would allow Wizards to nuke for high damage, low mana on raids, but without infinite stackability, since they would not each get their own buff icon, but would be overwriting for each other on a single buff icon. It would take a single Wizard multiple casts to ramp the buff up, and the final buff icon would not be over-writable, but would fade after being hit with again at max level, requiring another ramp-up. Raiding Wizards would like doing loads of DPS for low mana costs, and grouping Wizards would like doing large nukes for moderate mana costs (the nuke itself, which would do 500 DD at Level Zero, would be around 250 mana per cast, which would become as efficient as CoF at Level One, subsequent levels would bring the mana cost down well below that of CoV). In group settings, the more hitpoints/longer fight times per mob, better this nuke would be. In raid settings, the Wizzies could coordinate to use the tactic of timing their nukes so that they ramped the level up to maximum as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
That would give Wizzies a finitely-stackable instant DD line that could be high-damage/high-efficiency, but would not be immediately overpowering, and the finite stackability would favor raiding parties with five Wizards per raid, though fewer or more Wizards would still be able to use it, just not at peak efficiency. That would make Wizards desirable but not in large numbers like the current DD model.</div>

		<div>This whole thread sounds alot like disciplines.<br />
<br />
Wait, I know people hate seeing disciplines attached to casters.  So let's just call them, caster specializations, er maybe that's taken already.  NM, it'll never sell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Timer 1: offensive abiliities  (increase dps!)<br />
Timer 2: defensive abilities  (Mana conservation, less dps)<br />
Timer 3: avoidance abilities (deaggro, lower aggro)<br />
Timer 4: misc healing / pulling abilities (or mana regen!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

I like this idea so much I'll have to be the official Wizard Discipline advocate, similiar to the pointy hat squad.  Time to edit my sig.</div>

				Here's an idea for a future spell line:<br />
<br />
A &quot;Damage Sword&quot; in the same vein of Damage Shields.<br />
<br />
Where Mages are the masters of the DS and even &quot;burst&quot; DSs out there for Druids and Mages, they can keep that field. Even clerics with their reverse damage shield where the mob takes damage for every swing it makes. Why not have us reflect the cleric, like we have many times in the past? (The whole destruction/healing mirror).<br />
<br />
I would like to see a new line for wizards where the mob takes damage for every swing made against it. (At least, I'm fairly sure this doesn't exist yet.)<br />
<br />
Call the spell something like &quot;Burn Armor&quot;, &quot;Festering Fire&quot; or &quot;Burden of Lightning&quot;. *shrug*<br />
Have it cost perhaps... 100-200 mana.<br />
And then every time a successful melee hit is made against the mob, it takes an extra 2-5+ damage or whatever is deemed proper. It wouldn't stack up like other DSs though, so only one on the mob at a time.<br />
<br />
This would give the grouping wizard utility, the soloing wizard wouldn't be helped much if at all and the raiding wizard would still be able to focus soley on nuking with one wizard designated for this spell. Could also make it retro-active and give it to lower level wizards in a smaller form if they pull a Luclin and add it in like familiars.<br />
<br />
And of course, it would be aggro free like DSs, still keeping in the &quot;detrimental&quot; form of the wizard and something new without stepping on any toes.<br />
<br />
Just an idea.

I should have put that in this thread (rather than <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=40527&amp;page=3" target="_blank">that</a> one) in the first place.  Ah well.<br />
<br />
Also just to be noted, it isn't a reverse damage shield.  Those trigger when the mob successfully hits a PC, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
Clerics also have a version where players are healed when they hit a mob, so why not a wizard version that does a &quot;Damage Sword&quot; (or whatever you want to call it) where it is almost as if it a small nuke (though in DS format) when they hit a mob?</div>

They could give it some downside like inherent blindness if they must but I think it would be a very handy tool for wizzies who feel the aggro coming and I like the idea as far as lore of wizzies goes.</div>

Hmm, I'd like to see a &quot;reverse&quot; exodus.  You would pop your group back to the spot you just exodussed from.  If you you zone you lose the ability to do this.  Make it a long reuse AA, with some AA to shorten the recast timer.</div>

I actually didn't mean it in percetage. :)<br />
<br />
E.g.: Firebane uses a resist adjustment of -300. Add to this the -100 of Prismatic Focus and you have an adjustment of -400 which would be around 30%<br />
<br />
The idea was focussed around our big nukes. We all love it if you cast Ether Flame and get resisted on it or same for ACF or Corona Flare (whichever you use). Our big nukes all have only a resist adjustment of -10. Even if you add to this -50 from Pyromancy you only have a resist adjustment of -60 (add to this the Flux staff for -72 if you are keen).<br />
<br />
As our DPS comes only from nukes (pets can be neglected mostly), every partially or fully resisted nuke lowers our DPS significantly. Having a resist adjustment of -110 (or -160 with Pyromancy) would at least help us in this department. However it wouldn't affect the ingame implemented mob resists too widely aka if a mob is very resistant to fire your best choice would still be to use another nuke type or lures.<br />
<br />
Not saying this should be implemented like this but fact is that our resist adjustments definitely need work/improvement.<br />

<br />
Upgrade to Harvest of Druzzil whether spell or AA<br />
<br />
Mass punt to wizard's direction of choice, maybe like give us MGB except it would be MGT (Mass Group Teleport) as an AA.  Click that and say click group portal to Wall of Slaughter and everyone in range will get the option to take an X-loc to there.<br />
<br />
Maybe an Aura (Not a Trap) that would benefit the groups damage output.  Can be based off the number of people in the group the % of their direct damage spells goes higher.<br />
<br />
Wizard by himself 5% increase to all direct spell damage. <br />
Wizard with 1 other in group 7% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
Wizard with 2 other in group 9% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
Wizard with 3 other in group 11% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
Wizard with 4 other in group 13% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
Wizard with 5 other in group 15% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
