			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Gentlemen,<br />
<br />
We are at war, and the enemy is Communism.  Those red bastards in the East have the Bomb and they are now, as Goladus tells us, trying to develop economic autarky to use unfair methods to destroy American jobs, conquer peaceful democratic countries like Taiwan, and spread their brand of evil around the world. This foe would be dangerous indeed if they did not have one shortcoming: tiny cocks and an obsession with virgins.  If the United States can eliminate the population of virgins in China, there will be nobody left for Chinese Communist men to marry, causing widespread social upheaval and the end of the Communist Party.<br />
<br />
The Peace Corps says that China has a shortage of 500,000 English teachers. Prison statistics say that there are about 600,000 non-violent drug offenders in prison.  With these two statistics, PROJECT RANDY, a CLANDESTINE MISSION to destroy Communism is made possible.  Chinese dudes only want to marry chicks who are virgins for the most part. Banging some smelly foreigner dude = nobody wants to marry you anymore.  Gentlemen, this is a sexist and bad society that does sexist and bad things, and they don't even have the inches of dick to justify it.  This cannot be allowed to go on.<br />
<br />
THE PROPOSAL<br />
<br />
The American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will launch a clandestine mission into China, with the aim of setting up non-violent drug offenders in United States jails with fake credentials, including fake or degree-mill degrees, TESOL certs, a clean criminal background check, and everything they need to be sent over to China to begin teaching at some shithole of a Chinese school. They will also teach them the art of seduction and love making to the sweet Asian womens.  As part of this program, they will be given SECRET SLUT SHAMING SOFTWARE as part of a clandestine program to monitor and let the world know how filthy they are. No questions about STDs will be asked, and you know that means only one thing is coming: lady, Joe's gonna bring some crabs down to your shack.<br />
<br />
The convicts will be informed that they can serve their term in China or the United States.  If they come back, it's right back to the slammer for them. Once they reach their mission areas, they will be told that they will receive a $500 bonus for every documented chick they nail, deposited to their US bank account by the English teacher agency. By some means, everyone will know what happened - maybe some tramp stamps go on, maybe there's a big snapchat leak.  Something happens. 500,000 prison convicts each nail 100 girls over 2 years. Boom, that's 50% of the marriage-age female Chinese population. Maybe they knock some girls up. A lot of girls up. Massive numbers of half-black half-asian babies begin flooding into China. Once a convict knocks up, say, 30 girls, he gets to disappear and be given a fake identity and sent back to some other region of China.<br />
<br />
Eventually, there will be so many STDs, illegitimate biracial babies, and chaos that nobody will be able to get married ever again.  Millions of angry unmarried men will take to the streets.  The real estate market will collapse because of some weird population structure issue. People will be pissed that they are small cocked cuckold boys and will begin throwing rocks at government buildings (who are housed by the dudes who have the only remaining wives in the country) and the whole government will collapse, and be replaced by a democracy of some kind.<br />
<br />
This is Operation RANDY.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>&quot;Good Morning, This is Tinthalas Tigris. I was returning a call about a message I received from Joe Shmoe about the post I left on the forum. Is he available?&quot; <br />
<br />
This is how ive made phone calls since I was  5 years old. A brief stint when I was age 13 to 16 made me sometimes avoid it, but outside of that, the format has seldom  changed unless I am calling my wife, or someone else that I consider family - during work hours, i keep this format so that anyone lurking or spying wont cast judgement on my &quot;free time,&quot; if it were. <br />
<br />
I seldom encounter this from others, especially other work related calls, whether they are from people who call often, infrequent, or hardly ever. I answer my phone with bluetooth, so I seldom am looking at caller id either. Whether I am or not, it is fairly presumptious of the person calling to assume that i will be familiar with them by the typical, <br />
<br />
&quot;Is this Tinthalas? &quot;<br />
<br />
I tend to answer my phone during work hours as &quot;Maintenance.&quot; Even if it is my wife's ringer, i try to keep it professional so bystanders so not believe i am just goofing off.<br />
<br />
Where the hell did phone ettiquette go? Why is it something no longer expected? Especially of vendors? It is so rude. I am not going to identify myself until they identify themselves, and with so many forms of phishing available, jumping head first into someone identifying YOU by name is just as dangerous as putting other sensitive information out there. <br />
<br />
So frustrating.</div>
