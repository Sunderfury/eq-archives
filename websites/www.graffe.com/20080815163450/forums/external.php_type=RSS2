			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Myabe it's the stress form their work, delaing with many sick people, or the bureacracy of the NHS, I don't know...but FUCK ME!! <br />
This time a doc was smart arsed with my mum.<br />
<br />
My mum's old and very ill, spine was badly damaged when she was nursing, had to get operations to removed shattered discs etc, and of course, back then, they weren't so good at such stuff, plus the dye they used for spinal x-rays was toxic and caused more damage, forget the name of the stuff, got banned in Europe so the bastards sold it in Africa, grr.<br />
Anyklozing Spondylitis (spelling?), scarring on the spinal cord, so poor sod is in <i>lot </i>of pain, she was in and out of a wheelchair for years.<br />
<br />
She's a ballsy gal, learned to drive a hand controlled car, and was the first woman in the region to pass the police advanced driving course, and in a handcontrolled car, no less :)<br />
<br />
She's disabled, not <i>useless</i>....her being an ex-old time nurse, she's thus a pain in the arse stickler over housework and so she did that (or I'd have strangled her, lol), and I've done the heavy stuff, pushing her in wheelchair and shopping etc.<br />
<br />
We've looked after each other (and other family too, gran, grandpa and aunt who're now gone, alas) since we left my dad when I was a kid. <br />
<br />
Pushing her round in the wheelchair is a bastard thanks to the M.E., I have real problema dealing with more than 1 thing at a time, my brain literally &quot;slips gears&quot; sometimes and simply cannot think when complex situations arise, stuck there not able to think, and I get sicker from the exertion etc. <br />
luckily I was a big bugger, no way I could push her nowadays, if I had been a wee fella.<br />
Imagine yer brain being sandpapered, while you've got the 'flu, you'll get the idea.<br />
<br />
Mum's really bloody ill now, smoking damaged her lungs, 30% lung function, which has damaged her heart, obstructive pumonary disease, iirc. Plus arthritis thats' twisting her hands,. She's in lot of pain so I have to massage pain relieving gel into her legs, which are in a terrible state thanks to all those woes. S<br />
he says &quot;<i>her legs look like something out of Hamunaptra!&quot; </i>:evil:<br />
<br />
she loves my silly movies like &quot;The Mummy&quot;, and quotes them, lol, &quot;Split Second&quot; being her fave for quotes...hysterical hearing yer mum saying:<br />
<i>&quot;We need BIG f'ing guns!!...Halllujah!&quot;</i> <br />
or <br />
&quot;<i>Do you really get laid every night? Oh yeah!&quot;</i>   <br />
OMFG  :rofl: so, she's not some boring or senile old coot<br />
<br />
little point point on etququette, you just &quot;get&quot; if you spent time pushing someone round in a wheelchair, or if you have good manners:<br />
Just cause they are in a wheelchair, doesn't mean they are STUPID.<br />
it's very, very impolite and crass to talk to the person <i>pushing </i>the chair, <i>rather than </i>the person <i>in </i>the chair, k?<br />
<i>They are both people</i>.<br />
<br />
Now, fair enough though, if you know the folks and the disabled person is mentally disabled or young, and some issues are beyond their abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we get to the meat of why we're both pissed off:<br />
Over at local hospital, me in my &quot;Gopher and Pusher of Boudicca's Chariot&quot; role', lol. That is, I pusher her around, get stuff etc, and we both wind each other up :D<br />
<br />
mum needs to see a vascular specialist, her legs...jeesh...horrible...<br />
but instead, we get the fellow I saw some years ago about my &quot;almost zero testosterone&quot; problem, hm, he was in charge of endocrinology last I saw him.<br />
<br />
Now, he's an odd fella (rather odd but not unpleasant manner, I l don't mind quirly, lol), but he did help me, the doc I'd saw previously had left me to rot for over 3 years, with NO help, but this guy  had blew his stack on that ass, and got me on testosterone replacment right away. hence I am now able to do more stuff and not in such horrible distress.<br />
<br />
FYI, chatting on forums, painting/art on good days, and walking me dog 1/day 400 yards or twice that on a good day is about all I can do, I'm playing Neverwinter Nights 2 again past week,  but even that makes me sicker.<br />
<br />
So what does this doc do as soon as I get my mum's wheelchair in the room?<br />
<br />
For a bit of humour, <i>he just walks up to her, and turns her wheelchair round to face the wall!!!!!</i><br />
<br />
Do you realize how unbelievably crass, vile that is? 71 yea rold woman, in a wheel chair she cannot push, very sick, and he turns her round to face the wall, as a gag (ie, she cna't see him, he does it to put her in her place)<br />
<br />
he said himself, he sometimes gets in trouble for doing that, all the while grinning.<br />
<br />
WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH DOCS ROUND HERE?!??!<br />
Remember the crac form my GP about &quot;There were no fat folk in Belsen&quot;?<br />
<br />
I know not all docs are like that. When she collpased and got revived, ie, dead, those docs were nice and ninepence, same when I twisted me ankle, and my previous Moslem/Middle Eastern doc is one of the nicest human beings I've ever met.<br />
I <i>think </i>he was Iranian and had grown up in UK, maybe his folks had fled to here after the fall of the Shah? Pity he left, can't blame him though, the crap he got from Neds and scumbags was appalling. He'd take the time to talk to you, and he was a great diagnostician, probably not coincidental. Did more for me in 6 months than all the other bastards had in 10 years.<br />
<br />
But so many docs seem to be crass, useless bastards!! :rlymad: :angry:</div>

I've never heard of these addons.  I've just discovered Rawr and downloaded my gear from the armory.  The problem I've having with Rawr is that I can't figure out how to get it to take into account my spec when making gear/gem recommendations.  I'm spell hit capped and it keeps telling me to get more spell hit.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know about the above mods, Rawr, or other tools that can help evaluate gear/gem/spec combinations?</div>

				On January 9, 2008 Lockheed-Martin signed an agreement with EEStor for the exclusive rights to integrate and market EESU units in military and homeland security applications.[28] This was widely seen as lending a great deal of credibility to the company and its technology; ZENN, who had been taking flak for their investment in EEStor, saw their stock increase by 28%.[29] Lockheed has not yet tested prototypes, but did tour EEStor's facility and analyzed their technology and methodology. Lockheed was &quot;very impressed&quot; with EEStor, noting &quot;they are taking an approach that lends itself to a very quick ramp-up in production.&quot; The two companies look to complete joint product testing over the course of 2008.[30]

</div>First: A disclaimer: I'm not uber-hardcore anymore. So You may not feel I'm qualified enough to talk about anything.<br />
<br />
Let's see...what to say? <br />
<br />
Problem 1 - Well, maybe I was sucking last night, maybe all of us, but people were saying some heals weren't landing on anyone. (it certainly showed!) I'm not sure why. Also: Librarian kept spawning books at 40% nonstop until we got it to 20%. We beat Librarian with constant book spawns in this way - but give me a break. That's broken. <br />
<br />
At this point - I'm getting a little frustrated with the technical problems and bugs. <br />
<br />
Dark Knights have some sort of stun shit that made people /boggle last night. Either it's new or it's bugged or we were doing something differently and wrong. Anyone have anything on this? Apparently it also goes through walls to aggro other mobs, but that might be just a separate thing.<br />
<br />
Bugged mobs suck, and mobs running through the walls to the raid also suck. <br />
<br />
Stuck in combat after fights sucks. <br />
<br />
Problem 2 - &quot;Trash clearing sucks.&quot; - Make them drop more loot or change a few general spawn areas to mini-bosses. There's no excuse at this point. Trash clearing sucks. Don't punish us. <br />
<br />
Problem 3 - I have to clear the entire goddamn instance of quests to get a shitty ring upgrade? huh? is this how I should be thinking about it?<br />
<br />
Problem 4 - I hate being a squishy.</div>

				According to this article on German news site Nachrichten, as un-ablauted by Google Translate and turned into a slurry of humorous pidgin gobbledygook, a quantity of bacon is enough to set off hand luggage bomb detectors.<br />
<br />
Apparently, the traveler  on his way to America through Linz  was stopped going through after a machine detected that a piece of bacon his wife had packed &quot;had a similar molecular density to certain types of explosives.&quot;<br />
<br />
Confronted with an X-Ray of the bacon and asked to identify it, the nervous passenger replied: &quot;It's fat.&quot; In America, such flip would earn you a solid truncheoning, but the passenger was merely requested to open the package in a bomb-proof room and prove that it actually was bacon. <b>Humorously, the traveler apparently seemed worried that the bacon might actually be an explosive, as it was packed for him as a lunch by his wife, whom he was on the outs with.</b><br />
<br />
What happened to the traveler? The Nachrichten piece ends surrealistically:, ranting and raving about the Virgin Mary wanting to fly to Rome. It remains unclear at this time whether the bacon incident delayed the Holy Mother's pilgrimage, or whether the bacon was confiscated by customs officials for &quot;disposal.&quot;

				Our family has a favorite pizza place called Valentino&#8217;s, which we love to visit whenever we are in the city where it&#8217;s located. The only problem with Valentino&#8217;s pizza is that about two or three hours after eating it, a driving thirst sets in that can only be quenched by glass upon glass of water. We call it &#8220;post-pizza thirst.&#8221;<br />
<br />
There are no substitutes for quenching the post pizza thirst. Not pop. Not milk. Not even Gatorade. Just water. Pure, cool, refreshing water. No matter how hard you may guzzle, any imposter of water will end up leaving you thirsty and longing for true refreshment.

</div>The rest of that site wasn't too helpful.  Actually it's a little scary.  <br />
<br />
I'm just wondering if anyone knows why it happens.<br />
<br />
I used to think that Pizza must have a lot of cheese and sodium, because salt makes you thirsty right?  I know cheese makes me thirsty.  Well I've had all kinds of other salty foods and yeah, you get thirsty, but it's usually a right-away thirst.  Eat some cheese, salt, and pepperoni and you'll probably be craving some milk.  Pizza must do something to the water in your body because there's this delayed reaction and the thirst is most definitely for <i>water</i>.  It's not even really like being thirsty after a tough workout.</div>

I found it... the problem though is that the website is down. Lys, if you're reading this, if you could send me a link to the audio clip to download, or a place where I could find it, it would be appreciated.<br />

If anybody else has it, I would appreciate help on that as well. Preferably within the next hour, because I leave work at that point :p</div>

				Risk is fun, at least the moderate risks that were common in prior generations. An informal survey of children by the University of Toronto's Institute of Child Studies found that &quot;merry-go-rounds . . . anecdotally the most hated piece of playground equipment in hospital emergency rooms -- topped the list of most desired bits of playground equipment.&quot; Those of us of a certain age can remember sprinting to get the contraption really moving. That was fun. And a lot of exercise.<br />
<br />
America unfortunately is going in the opposite direction. There is nothing left in playgrounds that would attract the interest of a child over the age of four. Exercise in schools is carefully programmed, when it exists at all. Some schools have banned tag. Broward County, Fla., banned running at recess. (How else can we guard against a child falling down?) Little Leagues forbid sliding into base. Some towns ban sledding. High diving boards are history, and it's only a matter of time before all diving boards disappear.

				<b>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)</b> -- Euro-zone growth braked sharply in the second quarter as major economies Germany, France and Italy shrank, EU statistics showed Thursday, with high fuel and food prices holding back consumer spending.<br />
<img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2008/BUSINESS/08/14/europe.economy.downturn.ap/art.euro.dollar.jpg" border="0" alt="" /> Europe's biggest economies have stopped growing as high fuel and food prices bite.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Growth in the 15 economies that share the euro currency contracted by 0.2 percent from the first quarter, expanding just 1.5 percent from the same period a year ago, the EU statistical agency Eurostat said in a first estimate that it may change at a later date.<br />
Germany, the region's largest economy, shrank 0.5 percent in April-June from the previous quarter with France and Italy both down 0.3 percent.

With the impending dismissal of the NDA, are there plans to create a Warhammer forum?

				Verne 'Mini-Me' Troyer Suing Ex-Girlfriend for $20 Million<br />
<br />
Friday , August 01, 2008<br />

ADVERTISEMENT<br />
<br />
&quot;Mini-Me&quot; of &quot;Austin Powers&quot; fame is suing his ex-girlfriend and sex tape partner for $20 million, accusing her of throwing him to the ground, TMZ reports.<br />
<br />
In papers filed in federal court on Thursday, Verne Troyer, 39, accuses aspiring actress Ranae Shrider of intentional infliction of emotional distress and battery. Troyer says his ex-girlfriend once picked the lock to his bedroom, pushed away a scooter that was used to block the door and threw him to the ground.<br />
<br />
Ed McPherson, a lawyer for Troyer, told TMZ that &quot;when you pick up a 2 foot, 8 inch human being and throw him to the floor, it hurts.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Holly Bannon, a rep for Shrider, called the lawsuit &quot;ridiculous&quot; in a statement to Usmagazine.com:<br />
<br />
&quot;This lawsuit is ridiculous and riddled with lie upon lie from Verne Troyer and his camp,&quot; Bannon said. &quot;It is in our opinion a transparent attempt to secure as much publicity as he can from his less than average career in the wake of his most recent failure in 'The Love Guru.'<br />
<br />
&quot;The only abuse that ever occurred in their household was that of emotional abuse inflicted upon Ranae and her dog Lacy on the occasions when he hit Ranae and her dog with his 'reaching sticks' or kicked them when having one of his drunken rages.<br />
<br />
&quot;This alleged abuse certainly has not seemed to affect his recent round of interviews or his golf swing over the weekend. Is this not the same man who is renowned as a professional stuntman in all his movies?&quot;<br />
<br />
The suit comes after Shrider admitted she had leaked a clip of a sex tape she made with Troyer. (The actor settled a lawsuit he filed against a porn broker that will prevent distribution of the tape.)<br />
<br />
Troyer recently told Us Weekly about the humiliation he experienced after the footage surfaced.<br />
<br />
&quot;I put all the trust in her,&quot; Troyer told Us. <b>&quot;She kept the tape in her camera on top of the closet where I couldn't even reach it!&quot;</b><br />
<br />
Asked how he feels about Shrider, he told Us: &quot;Hate is a good word.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troyer next stars in &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; with Johnny Depp and Jude Law.
