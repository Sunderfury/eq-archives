Chapter 1<br />

 <br />
<br />
I approached the Gray Tower with some trepidation, holding the summons from the Arch Magus in my right hand as if it was a knife.  The Sun was directly overhead as I entered the Tower, a seamless gray obelisk that appeared to have been carved in geometric perfection out of a single megalith of granite.  I had only been in the City of Odun for one night when the messenger had arrived the next morning at breakfast, bearing the summons.  I had not the slightest clue how the Arch Magus even knew I existed, let alone my name and the inn where I was staying.<br />
<br />
As I entered the lobby, my eyes adjusted rapidly to the fairly bright light coming from half a dozen or so floating Wisps rolling around on the ceiling.  At the opposite end of the lobby from the entrance was a counter that covered the middle third of the back wall.  To either side of the counter was the entrance to a corridor.  Behind the counter was a rather pretty raven-haired girl.<br />
<br />
“I’m Kiril of Honge, here to see the Arch Magus,” I smiled at the receptionist.  She had taken my inventory the moment I entered, however, and was obviously not impressed by what she saw.<br />
<br />
“You’re expected, please take the corridor to the right, all the way to the door at the end,” she said in a tone that implied that I might very well be unable to follow even such a simple bit of direction.  “And don’t open any of the other doors, even the ground floor of this Tower is filled with dangerous magic.”<br />
<br />
I thanked her and proceeded through the entrance she’d indicated and down the darkening passageway to the door at the farthest end.  There was no handle or knob, just a painted circle on the side opposite the hinges.  I could see a Glyph protruding from the circle, a Glyph that ran, glowing, just under the surface of the stone and coiled at the top of the door like a spring, obviously a crude mechanism for opening the door.  I pressed the circle and the Glyph uncoiled a bit and the door opened wide.<br />
<br />
The room inside was brightly lit by several Wisps, and contained a large round table with a man sitting at its only chair.  Against the left wall was an unruly pile of wooden chairs of several different designs.  The man seated at the table was one of the tallest I’d ever seen, with long spidery arms that ended in huge thin-fingered hands that were holding open a small scroll.<br />
<br />
“Kiril of the Mad Eyes, I take it?” asked Arch Magus Starn as he rolled up the scroll.  Before I could answer, he gave a little nod and pointed at the haphazardly piled chairs to the side of the room and added “Please get yourself a chair from over there and come sit next to me.”<br />
<br />
I looked over the pile of chairs, and they all seemed to be Glyphed in one way or another.  One had a Sleep trap in the seat; another had a Flash burst waiting to temporarily blind whoever sat in the chair.  Finally I found a chair that had no magical traps woven into the seat, pulled that one out, and carried it around the table to sit at Arch Magus Starn’s left hand.<br />
<br />
The Arch Magus, who had been watching me intently since I came in through his door, gave another nod, and said “I can see that you can see Glyphs, and you knew to sit to my left, because I keep my offensive spells hanging on the right side of my belt.  It appears that my source was not wrong about you, Kiril of the Mad Eyes.”<br />
<br />
He paused, as if waiting for me to respond; but I sat silent, not about to give this strange man the satisfaction of asking him about his source.   After a bit he continued.<br />
<br />
“Last night in a dream, my predecessor, Arch Magus Jarn, appeared to me in a dream, bearing a palm leaf.  This was the agreed-upon symbol of our station, which only appears in dreams of great prophetic import.  Old Jarn told me that a great crisis would come upon all the world in the near future, and that I was to seek out a man named Kiril of Honge, also known as Kiril of the Mad Eyes, who would be staying at the Cup &amp; Plate Inn on Old Temple Street.  I was to induct this young man into our Order as an Apprentice, and train him in the magical arts, at my own expense.”<br />
<br />
I finally spoke, unable to keep all of the surprise out of my voice: “But I’m 24 years old, and most Apprentices begin their training at the age of 15!”<br />
<br />
“Both myself and Jarn are aware of this, I assure you,” he replied drily.  “But Jarn obviously knew more about you than I do, although my little rumor mill tells me that you are a spear for hire who has a reputation as a strong fighter who has been driven out of several towns for a range of reasons.”<br />
<br />
I said nothing, but some hint of a reaction must have showed on my face, because he then chuckled and clapped me on my right shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Never mind the rumor mill for a moment.  Why don’t you go ahead and tell me the story of you in your own words.”  He gestured towards a tray in the middle of the table.  “I wouldn’t mind a cup of wine about now, would you mind pouring?  Feel free to pour one for yourself; I’d not make a man tell tall tales with a dry whistle.”<br />
<br />
I’d noticed the tray, and had also noticed the most subtly drawn Glyph I’d so far encountered, hiding as a bit of detail on the label of the wine bottle.  It seemed to be a Truthspeak Barb, although without a glass to magnify it I could not be sure of that.  I subtly shifted to grasp the bottle with my Shield Hand instead of my Sword Hand, and the Barb failed to so much as scratch my surface as I poured us a couple of generous glasses.  I pretended to go a bit stiff and blurted out the following:<br />
<br />
“I was born to a lone spinster who raised chickens and sold eggs, who sold me as Apprentice to a caravan guard company on my Twelfth birthday.  At age 14 I was fired by my Master for fighting with my fellow guards.  Ever since then, I have worked for-hire to anyone who needed a spear for hire.  My banishments have mainly been due to sleeping with the wrong ladies, besting the wrong sons in fisticuffs, and general bad luck.”<br />
<br />
“Impressive,” said the Arch Magus.  “You obviously have some way of defeating the Truthspeak Barb.  Or else you would not have conveniently left out that your mother was thought by the townsfolk to have consorted with an Incubus, a sprite from the Plane of Red Life, and that you were believed Uncanny by the locals, and that two of your fellow guards tried to rob and kill you on payday but you wound up killing them instead in the most gruesome way imaginable, and that you are now a suspected thief masquerading as a spear for hire.”<br />
<br />
I managed to not spit wine all over the Arch Magus, but barely.  I’d long ago learned to keep silent when surprised, so I waited for him to speak again.<br />
<br />
He nodded to himself, as if I’d just answered a question to his liking.  “But Jarn made me feel like an Apprentice in comparison when he was alive, so I have no doubt that he has the ability even in death to reach me in my dreams.  So I shall do as he instructed, and take you on as an Apprentice.”<br />
<br />
“What makes you think that I would accept an Apprenticeship in the Magic Arts when I am already a journeyman spear for hire?”  Even though I wouldn’t dream of letting this opportunity for knowledge and power go by, my question and my curiosity were both genuine.<br />
<br />
The Arch Magus chuckled with a surprisingly bubbly laugh for a graybeard.  “In my experience, there are three things that big boys and young men desire above all else: Food, women, and power.  And from what I’ve heard, Kiril of the Mad Eyes, you’ve an exceeding fondness for all three.  You’d sooner go without wenches and beef than to let a chance for more power slip through your grasp.  I’ve already sent for your things from the inn, and Karima at the reception desk will have you brought up to your room, where a cold supper will be laid in for you.”<br />
<br />
I bent a bit at the waist and spread my hands as if in mock acquiescence to a superior argument.<br />
<br />
“One last thing before you go, Kiril of the Mad Eyes:  I have to ask you two questions about your past that no rumor mill can answer.  First, is it true that the two fellow guards who tried to rob and kill you were turned inside-out?  Second, if yes, how did you accomplish that?”<br />
<br />
This Arch Magus was too sharp to swindle with a cheap lie, so I opted for the truth.  “You said it yourself, I was sired by a denizen of the Fleshworld.  Somehow, at times dictated by certain conditions, such sprites can mold, reshape, sculpt, twist, and design flesh as if it was wet clay.  Somehow the mode of attack those two scoundrels used triggered the conditions that gave me such power over their bodies.  It was as if by attempting to steal my life within the protective circle of our campfire, they had forfeited control over their own by contract.  Somehow, I just knew in my heart that they belonged to me, to do with as I wished.  And I wished them dead.  And it was so.”<br />
<br />
And with that I walked out of the room to seek Karima the Receptionist.</div>
