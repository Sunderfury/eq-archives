		<blockquote class="restore">Yes. 30 minute queues for single/two players. It got better later at night, but honestly, I have no idea why there's any queues for a scenario that's supposed to take any three characters and throw them in. I assume it's a hardware limitation on number of instances that can be open, and if so, it makes you wonder about the 30 minute queues in early Cataclysm being reduced to 15 minutes by the devs. How much of that was those satchels as incentives to tanks, and how much was them upgrading hardware that should have been updated prior to launch?<br />
<br />
The run awards JPs (my one non-capped alt got capped from these), a satchel that either has a LFR-level epic in it or fireworks, and the first run gives you a tabard (Alliance). My guess is the epic is about a 50% drop from the satchel. It's not tuned to your spec at all, just your general class. My healing priest got the Hit hat, my warlock got the SPI hat. What makes it pretty bad is the vast majority of epics out of the satchel are hats. These hats don't have gem slots, and since your old hat should still have a functioning enchant on it (I took mine off and on to verify that the old enchants have in no way been disabled) and gem slots if it's a 378 from the five mans, the new hats are worthless in comparison. One thing I didn't get a chance to check: if multiple runs all give a satchel with a chance for an epic or not. As pre-expansion events go, though, this is fairly weak. The scenario itself looks like it'll be fun at 90, at least.</blockquote>

</div>Yes, those were my exact thoughts. Scenarios are supposed to be GOLD for DPS. Wow, way to mess up a good thing.<br />
I believe you're right about the hardware limitations - I mean, what else could it be ? You have a pool of several million players ready to go - pair up three, attaboy!<br />
Half the fun of scenarios would be three tanks and three healers thrown together - not likely to happen, but would make a great story :)</blockquote>

</div>Especially not when I started my queue just prior to midnight PST on Tuesday. I know there's enough Aussies out there that &quot;there's nobody in the queue&quot; was not an issue, plus the two alts I ran the scenario with after that had much shorter queues (2-3 minutes tops, then 30 minutes). Note: both my leather types (rogue, guardian druid) have made it in within 2-3 minutes both times they've done it. I have to wonder if the game is trying to mix up armor types, so every group has someone who can theoretically take a hit, and my paladin is getting the shaft because of all the plate DPS types out there.</blockquote>

</div>That sounds like a good explanation for the delay. <br />
Not that I think the game needs to do that, seeing as people are soloing just fine without plate DPS. Odd.<br />
Also, since people are getting loot BAGS, instead of drops from the mob, there's no need to ensure that loot will rot - by mixing different armor types.<br />
<br />
Very odd indeed. But your explanation makes the most sense.</blockquote>

</div>Betcha they do. Hasn't this been their standard explanation for this kind of thing? (1hr+ queues sound insane. Why can't they just group people together by when they queued? Never more than 2 people waiting at once, plus or minus latency and processing delay.)</blockquote>

Surely by now they can alter spawn rates/points so that if they allowed 4 or 5, you get a few extra packs of trash, or even bump the HP of the mobs dynamically.<br />
<br />
Do this, and still allow 3 people to be queued and placed in an instance, and they'll fix a few more problems with the design.</blockquote>

We managed to miss spotting the portal back to Org both times and therefore missed the cutscene.  Also ran into the central building for a bit of an explore and Jaina one-shot me. :(<br />
<br />
The scenario is generally very easy, tho clearly we outgear it currently.  I found mobs seemingly constant polymorphing me to be very annoying.<br />
<br />
After that the two of us queued once more and got a random third instantly, this time watching the cutscene.  My prediction is that scenarios in general are going to become massive speed runs in the future.  The lack of much in the way of lore or dialogue was kinda disappointing, but I think leaving it out is going to be the best decision longer term.  People just won't care when they'll probably do all of these 50+ times by the end of Mists.</blockquote>

I don't really sweat about gearing up unless it limits me somehow - for example the Argent Tournament group dungeon required a 185iLevel and I only have 162.</blockquote>
