			<div><strong>Best way to sustain DPS on raid encounters</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>I know it's possible to generate huge DPS on the short-term.  On new spells, there isn't anything really efficient short of &quot;chain-casting&quot; Claw of Selay.  The instant nukes are nice for their quick casts and -50 resist mods, but they really hog mana big-time.  The conventional nukes are, at first glance, more mana-efficient, but the lack of a decent resist mod makes them get resisted way more often which basically cancels the efficiency.<br />
<br />
Thus, I am finding myself running out of mana 3 to 4 minutes (just guessing there) into a fight even after using harvest, but I have been mixing in cloudburst strikes as well.  Is going with the magic line (for lower focus penalties) making a difference for those of you who are trying that?  I may have to spend 30 AA to get that flappy.<br />
<br />
The only parallel to the old tactic of casting Chaos Flame until GOM procs is casting Claw (which is sooooo slow) and then either Cold Snap (which can slow your claws even more) or whatever the conventional ice nuke is when GORM procs.  Not the huge DPS we dreamed of. . .<br />
<br />
Another thing I considered is casting Claw (I have rank II whoopie) and then EC when GORM procs, but this would require me to lose flappy focus on one or the other (no bard song for level 71+ and I don't get grouped with bards that often).  I have tried using concussive blast to determine nukes to use (by the proc) but that mixes foci again.  <br />
<br />
I have a 13k mana pool or so raid buffed.   Just curious what the rest of you are doing.  I know I should probably re-roll my wizard for asking this (j/k, Kela!) but I am getting frustrated with being oom so fast and THEN having to chain cast Claw of Selay.  I want to be the best wizard I can be but no point in walking the aggro line early when I am just gonna be oom.</div>

		<div>Actually I welcome questions and encourage wizards that wish to make themselves better.  Give me an average wizard who wants to learn over one who refuses to play any day of the week.   Anyways....<br />
<br />
I glanced at your gear and since you said you have 13k mana I assume the magelo is a bit out of date.  You're really hurting yourself without magic focus at this point in time in my opinion.  Right now the absolute best ANY wizard can do, and this includes the one or two wizards that have located new fire focuses, is with the magic line of spells.  There are simply too many focuses that are being degraded too heavily to use any other spells.  The cold spells are 74/73 I believe, Fire 74/75 and magic are 73/72.  <br />
<br />
Now I speak from someone who has focuses that go up to level 72.  Even if your focuses only apply up to 70, its still obviously better to go with the lowest possible level spell.  Every single raid that I've encountered during this expansion, Ball Lightning and Cloudburst Strike have maximized my DPS.  I cast Patient Harvest at around 65% mana so that it will come back up sooner.  I also click any mod rod I might have long before I really need it so that it will also refresh sooner.  <br />
<br />
I've never been one to use Claw of Vox in the past so I've kept Claw of Selay tucked away.  I've always found its better to use regular nukes unless we're talking a 30 minute steady fight which I have yet to see.  <br />
<br />
I really think the biggest problem people are ignoring are their focuses.  Ball Lightning is more efficient of a spell than Sothgar's Flame (last I checked it was, that might have been pre release)  Some people might claim how wonderful rains are but I rarely find them appropriate and can't speak from personal experience with those..I believe tears is level 71 so that would be acceptable to use although there aren't any other good fire spells to use at that level.  A magic rain would ahve been nice.<br />
<br />
Ball and Cloud....only way to fly.  I'd also never use Cold Snap unless I was soloing or exclusively casting instants.  But like Gem said...I micromanage my DPS to the last 0.0001.  And I've never met a wizard who could consistantly outparse me.</div>

		<div>The only concern I have about using magic nukes is that so many mobs seem to be more resistant to it, supposedly to make it more difficult to slow them.  Tash and Malo should knock it down a bit but I (anecdotaly) seem to recall a lot more difficulty landing magic nukes even after that.  Most of my experiences with this were in Anguish, where I have most of my high end experience, but we do that at most once a week now.<br />
<br />
Having said that, if it works for you at your level, it should work for me.  Just curious where you guys raid mostly, Kela?  We haven't been able to beat Queen Sendaii more than once because now that we have the encounter beaten the freaking zone crashes in wave 3 EVERY TIME. . .otherwise, we would be in DPoB by now (which I understand crashes all the time as well /sigh)</div>

		<div>I ran some numbers in Excel and Sothgar's Flame appears to be slightly better dps than Ball Lightning even with DP magic and fire foci. Rather less efficient though.<br />

Of course, there are inevitably going to be rounding differences, and my numbers might simply be wrong :p.<br />

		<div>DPS is really not important.  The question is: how much damage I can do during the fight?<br />
<br />
Sothgar's Flame may be more DPS than Ball lightning.  However, If I chain cast SF, Harvest, Mod Rod, chain cast SF again and end up OOM before the mob is dead, then I chose the wrong spell.  I would have gotten more total damage with the more efficient Ball Lightning.  Take that idea to the logical conclusion, if it is an extreme endurance fight, then I can maximize total damage by chaining Chaos Flame.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if the fight is so short that I still have mana left chaining SF, then I should have been using instant nukes.<br />
<br />
Lately most of my fights have been endurance fights.  My pattern has been to chain cast Sothgar's Flame until I am depleted enough to get a full harvest.  After that I switch to Chaos Flame, but mixing in Sothgar's Flames so that my mana drops at the same rate as the mob's hps.  Hopefully they should both reach 0 at the same time.  Of course, mod rod and harvest as soon as they are available.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Kela's post, I realize I've been stuck in the &quot;fire is best&quot; tunnelvision.  I think I'll be using Ball Lightning quite a bit more from now on.<br />

For me it's more of a trade-off though, as I only have dragon magic focus (and CoA mp/haste), but DK cold/fire. Basically, it's always going to depend on the expected length of the fight, I think.</div>

		<div>When I look at numbers I tend to just look at base numbers and when I think about focuses I just take whatever % focus and divide it in half and assume that number will be used.  I also don't think about crits.<br />
<br />
With DK / DP focuses:<br />
Ball Lightning Rk. ii - 4203, 809 mana, 7.0 sec - level 72, focuses undegraded<br />
5568.975, 647.2 mana, 4.1 second cast time<br />
DPS - 1358, DPM - 8.605<br />
<br />
Sothgar's Flame Rk. ii - 4900, 986 mana, 8.0 sec - level 75, focuses degraded 3 levels<br />
0.2*(0.95)(0.95)(0.95) = 0.171475 ,  (1-0.171475)*986 =  816.92565 mana<br />
0.65*(0.9)(0.9)(0.9)=0.47385 / 2 = 0.236925 * 4900 + 4900 =  6060.9325<br />
4.9 sec cast time (shown)<br />
DPS - 1236.925, DPM - 7.419<br />
<br />
Obviously if you're having difficulty landing magic nukes, you'll have to try another approach but on average I haven't found very many places that magic doesn't work.  The most difficulty that I've had with it was this afternoon on a quick jaunt through Anguish.<br />
<br />
Carlos case may or may not be different.  He'll take two hits of 10% on his magic focus or three hits on his fire.  Also have to keep in mind mana preservation and spell haste which are also taking hits.  Picking up new fire focus might even out the DPS but you'd still have a lower mana efficiency</div>

Also there's no new bard song for magic... only fire and cold.<br />
<br />
Also, for those without demiplane focus, there's a tradeable 25% (to 75) fire focus readily available.  None that I'm aware of for cold or magic.<br />
<br />
Or consider that up until recently magic nukes sucked balls and many wizards won't have any magic familiar at all thus neccessitating the expenditure of 33 aa's to catch up in that department.</div>
