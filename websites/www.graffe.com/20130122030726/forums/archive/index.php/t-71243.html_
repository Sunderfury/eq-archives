<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laedria</div><div class="date">May 10th, 2011, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could be a number of things.  Bad drop to the house, water in the line or tap, squirrel chews if your line is overhead, system problem....call first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zumino Zufeilon</div><div class="date">May 12th, 2011, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first bet would be the Cable network is having issues.  Does your tv have reception issues at about the same time?  (if not, don't worry, they're sorta-separate creatures, but often they do have issues at the same time).<br />
<br />
Call the cable company, see what they say.<br />
<br />
If they say nothing's wrong, take a can of compressed air and blow out the cable modem.  Overheating can be an issue, and it looks exactly like what you're describing.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, it get's more complicated.  Is this a recent phenomena, or has it just gotten worse recently (i.e. have you always had . . . stability issues with your cable, just rarely, or never had an issue before?).<br />
<br />
If you've always had some kind of uncommon connectivity issues, you might be having the same issue my parents had for 5 years.  It took me a LONG time to figure it out, but the signal was coming in &quot;too hot&quot; and was causing their modem to overheat.  It was an occasional issue at first, got more common as time went on, and got less common when I sprayed out their cable modem.  I ended up finally tracking it down, added a pair of splitters to the line (nothing connected, just using the signal degradation to cool down the signal some).<br />
<br />
If it's a more recent problem only, have you had any thunderstorms recently.  Particularly in the ~3 months prior to it starting to act up?  And does the cable line have a surge protector on it (hell, does the cable modem!?).  Assuming there isn't a cable network problem, your symptoms sound exactly like overheating, which can be an early symptom of a power surge that didn't fry something outright.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DietCanada</div><div class="date">May 20th, 2011, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">called a few times. they keeped telling me they cant see nothing  wrong on their their end.  did say it could be the router a few times which why i made sure to plug the modem into my pc some but still was getting the issue. next step pretty much was a service call and thats just to expensive right now  .<br />
<br />
<br />
might be over heating. thanks i'll try blowing on the modems vents :)<br />
<br />
i also had a lot of t storms when i posted this. i have all my electronics connected to a surge but not my cable.<br />
<br />
the latest thing i did was take the modem into another room and the cable line would turn back on within a min fixing it the problem for a day when i plugged it back in the pc room.  <br />
<br />
That got me to thinking maybe the line does not have enough amp. Got a new cox cable and ran it off the last free opening from the amp to the upstairs  to the modem and left the cable plugged into the old line(was actually splitting the old line one for cab, other for net) . seems to be working so far for the past 3 days with no prob.<br />
<br />
guess when i get a new modem later on i should get a surge with cox protection too lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
That *may* give you the modem's page, depending on model.<br />
From there you can usually see the Receive Power Level, Signal to Noise Ratio, and Transmit Power Level and depending on how locked down cox has their firmware, possible a few other things too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Schezar</div><div class="date">May 21st, 2011, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ask what they are showing as signal level to and from the modem. Ask them how many t3 and t4 timeouts they show in the past 7 days.</div></div><hr />
