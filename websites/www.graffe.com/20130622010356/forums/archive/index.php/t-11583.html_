(Also, if anyone knows if Shei's 4 guards will respawn immediately if you kill them after you kill the merchant Shei.... &lt;3 &lt;3.  We know if we kill them while merchant Shei is up they respawn instantly, but didn't get the chance to find out if they respawn when real Shei is up, as our first attempt went kind of haywire when they broke loose.)</div></div><hr />

Anyway, your cleric was correct. DI can ONLY go of if the person is below 15% health to do a check on the spell. That also means that any instant deaths (including one rounding of a tank ala Quarms 4x3.8k hits) that dont let the tank stay in that hp area (15% to neg 9hp) will not allow DI to go of. What happends basiclly is tanks goes to that level of hp and the spell throws a magic dice (or has already thrown depending on who you ask!) to see if it goes of or not. But if you go 50% to dead in one hit then you never hit the &quot;magic&quot; area and it cant go of.<br />
<br />
Hope that rambeling clears it up.</div></div><hr />

aren't the luclin+ DTs stopped by DA?</div></div><hr />

I don't know about old world death touches, but I remember seeing someone around here say that they'd killed Shei with like 4 people--  Using pets with more than 20k hitpoints.  Would say impossible today (as that is charmed pets, charmed pets cant hold aggro with 4 people there) to do that though. Might be able to pet zerg her though. Fourish regular pets and then charmed for damage.<br />
<br />
To Milaru, there are TWO DTs. The skill based one (CT is good example) and the spell based one. First version of Cursed for example had BOTH versions but only the spell version is blocked by DA (or Sanctuary that paladins get that makes them immune to spells). Difference is one says, X beginns to cast a spell before it (almost instant or instant cast spell that is interuptable).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shei casts a spell called Cazic Touch.<br />
<br />
Work with it.<br />

Edit (Bah, thats what I get for getting coffee before pressing submit :D)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hika Mindsong</div><div class="date">December 9th, 2003, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does Shei Vinitras cast Cazic Touch (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=982&amp;source=Test), or Touch of Vinitras (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2859&amp;source=Test) (i.e. the &quot;Luclin Deathtouch&quot;)?  One is specially coded (i.e. Innoruuk says ,'FENDRYL!') and is utterly irresistable due to wonky code, the other is a more straightforward 20k damage effect.<br />
<br />
I've never fought Shei, but if Shei does the zonewide /say then it's likely Cazic Touch.  If she doesn't then it's likely Touch of Vinitras.  The latter may be divine aura'ble, although I wouldn't bank on it until I tried it.  The former is not divine aurable last time I checked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khael</div><div class="date">December 9th, 2003, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC, they don't instant respawn when they die after real Shei has been spawned, but new ones respawn whenever a PC dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiberinus</div><div class="date">December 9th, 2003, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I beleive its Touch of Vinitras, I do not recall her shouting when we have done her.   It can be &quot;blocked&quot; with Bard DA, Cleric DA/DB and Bestow, Harmshield I think, and a few others including Paladin Sactification.<br />
<br />
Its on a timer, you can time it.<br />
<br />
We just lock down the guards and kill Shei then worry about the guards - easier for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rombus</div><div class="date">December 9th, 2003, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shei (and Cursed) cast Touch of Vinitras.  I'm fairly sure you can't use Divine Intervention to protect from it, but you can use DA to miss it.  Shei can still be killed via charm pets as well... it's just more difficult now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quineloe</div><div class="date">December 9th, 2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">paladin disc doesnt block it either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ClaudShatterglass</div><div class="date">December 9th, 2003, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, Tibernius, Shei uses a spell called Touch of Vinitras, not Cazic Touch.  One might want to check to see if they've got their shit straight before they get condescending.<br />
<br />
The timer's 120 seconds, and we had someone clocking it, we just didn't get a chance to get far with it because our add discipline with the initial 4 guards was so poor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rombus</div><div class="date">December 9th, 2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have tanks ready, switch to adds when someone dies and burn them with the whole guild while the tank holds Shei.  Once all adds are dead, switch back to Shei.  Remove anyone who dies to a non-DT.</div></div><hr />
