			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A couple of video's of death knight gameplay.  Having watched them, I can say it is amazing what the current capabilities of the death knight are.  In two of the videos, the only downtime that is taken is the time to find another monster to kill.  It's incredible what the death knight can accomplish.  I definitely see some number adjustment going on to various Death Knight abilities and talents, as I doubt Blizzard wanted them as powerful as they appear in these videos.  If they did, well, I shudder at the thought of facing one in PvP.<br />
<br />
The videos include 2 instances of Blood spec non-stop grinding, one of AoE grinding involving corpse explosion and death and decay (which looks amazing, I might add), and one demonstrating the control and burst capabilities of Frost (the jaw dropping part happening within the first minute).<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/user615417/videos" target="_blank">http://www.vimeo.com/user615417/videos</a><br />
<br />
Some random thoughts:<br />
-Death and Decay looks to complement paladin AE tanking incredibly well.<br />
-Death and Decay will probably get adjusted to be a channeling spell<br />
-The range of on the pull mob-taunt ability will probably be decreased<br />
-Blood Worms will probably either have their chance to spawn reduced or have their health restored reduced<br />
-The ghoul is sweet<br />
-The visual effects of Death Knight spells are incredibly well done.  I hope this mean other classes' spells might get an overhaul in the future.<br />
-Death's Gate looks amazing in particular<br />
-Corpse Explosion grinding, while looking impressive, is probably only feasible when you have a couple of mobs with real low HP (as the little slimes in the video did)<br />
-A skilled player behind a death knight is a force to be reckoned with</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Short version:<br />
Old school action movie but nothing revolutionary, cheap tickets or rent it.<br />
<br />
Long version:<br />
I'm a huge fan of the card game of MC, the back story is very interesting esp. if you look at the factions etc. Hence when I heard that a movie was coming out I was dreading the outcome, MC is not exactly a PC world, you got demons, heretics, demonic temples while greed is good and evil walks on earth. How could you ever make a movie out of this?<br />
<br />
Well as it turns out you can't really. The story is focused on earth and you don't get to see a whole lot of the actual five corporations (well considering the time it would actually been four) or how they interact. The start up scene gives an idea at least though. The world it is playing out in is a WW2 with steam tech kind of set up yet they do have modern weapons as well but not modern tanks etc. for the troops (costs to much).<br />
<br />
The story is straight forward enough an ancient enemy is let lose on earth and only our gang of heroes can save us (ever heard that one before?). The story becomes a bit more interesting (though not a whole lot) when the ancient enemy starts to show how it is created etc. but nothing major. One of the things which surprised me though was how bloody it was yet not going over the top. Also it surprised me slightly in how it played out in terms of main character development.<br />
<br />
Still I'd have to say I recommend it, it is a interesting movie but not a masterpiece one. Get good price on the tickets or rent it and watch it in complete darkness,</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As much as I like a pritine aquarium - super clean, sparkling water - I've decided that algae is a good thing.  After thinking about Koi ponds, and the amount of slime that is allowed to grow - I decided NOT to scrape the algae off the back wall of my aquarium.  It has turned into a brown green mat of something awful, but somehow doesn't look all that bad against a black background.<br />
<br />
But the interesting thing is how much this has improved my water quality.  It used to be that weekly water changes were a must - but now, my tank can go a whole month between water changes.  My fish (one large goldfish in a 30 gallon tank) is much more energetic, and seems to be doing much better health wise.  His fins were rather beat up - but they are improving dramatically, I believe because the of the water quality improvements.<br />
<br />
Lesson learned I guess - sometimes there is such a thing as too clean...<br />
<br />
What do you all do with algae in your tank?  Eliminate or allow?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Short version:<br />
Only rent if you are a desperate Starship Trooper fan and got half a bottle of scotch to down before seeing it (the other half will be used afterwards trying to forget it had the ST name on it). <br />
<br />
Long version:<br />
I'm a Starship Trooper fan, I'll admit it straight up. I've read the book and still did not go into a frenzy over how the movie did not follow the book. I saw it for what it was, I laughed and enjoyed it greatly.<br />
<br />
I saw ST2, I flinched at the new computer models, I tried to find some reason not to send a bill to Hollywood for the wasted time. There was one or two moments which was worth watching.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the cartoon version, well done, story was predictable but hey, take it for it was.<br />
<br />
And now I saw ST3 was due to come out and that it was to be &quot;closer to the original&quot; I had some very minor hopes it would not be a Episode 1 - 3 fiasco. Ok, they have remodelled the bugs again fine. They added another three new once for dubious reasons in case of at least one but I'd argue two but ok, I can live with that. They went back to the TV commercial set up and tried to bring it back to ST1, I can dig that. <br />
<br />
But who in the seven hells was paid to write this story because a three year old with a crayon could have done better!!! I was hoping for something more along the lines of Mutant Chronicles (decently done I have to say though the end was, well, stupid) where there was a bit of darkness in the story. I wanted steroid pumped, barb wire chewing, gasoline pissing sergeants with nukes taking on legions; not a bunch of fat guys with tied shoe laces tumbling around trying to figure out which end of the gun to point towards the enemy! I wanted to see new all improved weapons of mass destruction not have the machine guns suddenly downgraded to water guns with out water.<br />
<br />
The only saving grace comes in the name of the movie, the marauders, and only because I'm a desperate fan of what they are (don't want to spoiler that part). Sadly the marauders are in there for a minute or so in total and that is it. The only other saving grace is the song (you'll know which one once you've seen it) I guess but only if you got black humour.</div>

'I'm just another Scot with MS'  <br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
By Elizabeth Quigley <br />
BBC Scotland  <br />
<br />
<br />
It was January 2000 and I'd just started a new job, my dream job as political correspondent for BBC Scotland. <br />
<br />
I was very busy, working long hours, so I didn't have much time to pay attention to this strange tingling in my face, but the tingling grew until eventually everything to the left was tingling and pins and needles, and everything to the right was fine. <br />
<br />
I convinced myself the problem lay in my wisdom teeth and I'd have to have them extracted: a prospect that terrified me. <br />
<br />
So, I went to my GP, sure I was wasting his time, and that he would send me to the dentist. He didn't. Instead he made me an appointment with the neurologist at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow for the next day. <br />
<br />
Despite the speed of the appointment, I didn't realize the seriousness of the situation. <br />
<br />
  Back then I didn't know anyone with multiple sclerosis, no one in my family had the disease, and it wasn't an illness I knew much about <br />
 <br />
<br />
The neurologist did a few tests asked me to move my legs about, and examined my face. He said: &quot;I think it's inflammation of the nerves, but to make sure we should get an MRI scan done, and we'll do that tomorrow.&quot; <br />
<br />
I still didn't think any of this was a big deal. I went along for the MRI scan and was called in for diagnosis. <br />
<br />
I remember sitting in the waiting room and as I was getting up to go across, feeling a complete fraud, and this lady said to me as I was walking away, &quot;you've got nothing to worry about, you're very healthy&quot;. <br />
<br />
And I walked away past her along to the neurologist's office thinking you're right, I've nothing to worry about, I'm a complete fraud, what a waste of time. <br />
<br />
MRI scan <br />
<br />
I went in and sat down opposite the neurologist, noticed there was a nurse there as well, which struck me as a bit strange, but I didn't really think too much about that. <br />
<br />
And then the neurologist said: &quot;Yeah, the MRI scan that has confirmed that it is inflammation of the nerves&quot;. And I'm thinking, &quot;fine, well you knew that already apparently&quot;. <br />
<br />
But the shock hit me when he added: &quot;And that is eh Multiple Sclerosis.&quot; <br />
<br />
Back then I didn't know anyone with multiple sclerosis, no one in my family had the disease, and it wasn't an illness I knew much about. <br />
<br />
But since I've learned Scotland is believed to have the highest rates of multiple sclerosis in the world. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Elizabeth Quigley was delighted to land a job as a BBC political reporter <br />
<br />
About 10,500 - or one in 500 people here - has MS. <br />
<br />
Their symptoms range from the mild and hidden, to the more severe. <br />
<br />
For me, eight years ago it was a tingling in my face, now I get tired more easily and sometimes have to use a stick to walk. <br />
<br />
In terms of the progression of the disease, the most frustrating thing is not knowing what the future holds. MS is not something I think about every minute of every day, but it is something I've had to face while making this film. I'm determined to find out why Scotland has such a high rate of the disease. <br />
<br />
Whenever I mention the statistics to people the immediate response is always the same - Why? Why is that? Well the simple answer is - no-one knows. <br />
<br />
As a journalist it's annoying not to be able to find a satisfactory answer to that question and as someone living with MS it's extremely frustrating. <br />
<br />
Building blocks <br />
<br />
I wanted to delve deeper, and that's why I've spent the last few months investigating the disease for a BBC documentary &quot;Scotland's Hidden Epidemic: The truth about MS&quot;, to be broadcast on Wednesday July 23 at 2245. <br />
<br />
My journey to find out about this curious connection between MS and the country I love, where I was born and grew up is what this programme is all about. <br />
<br />
I've travelled to Orkney and Canada, interviewed world leaders in the study of MS and met other people living and coping with MS just like me who are keen to find out why it's so common here. <br />
<br />
MS can often quite literally be mapped along lines of latitude. It's more common the further north you travel from the equator - and lack of sunlight and Vitamin D are all factors. Another theory is that a virus triggers the onset of the illness. <br />
<br />
And it looks like it's probably a combination of all these things - a combination of building blocks - building up to MS. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Elizabeth Quigley took her investigation to Nova Scotia <br />
<br />
But these are not the only factors in explaining why and where MS occurs. <br />
<br />
Genetics seem to play a role in all this. Dr Jim Wilson of Edinburgh University has just launched a major study looking at MS in the Northern Isles. Orkney and Shetland are widely believed to have the highest rates of MS on the planet. <br />
<br />
Dr Wilson wants anyone with MS, whether an Orcadian living at home or away, to get in touch. <br />
<br />
So, could there be a Scottish gene, or genes? Could MS really be something we Scots have taken around the globe over the centuries? It's a startling thought, and one which I investigate in the documentary. <br />
<br />
It's been tough at times. MS is a disease I have, but not one I think about every minute of every hour of every day. But it's also been fascinating, and inspiring. <br />
<br />
And, however the mystery tour of my MS ends, finding a cure or even some answers as to why it's so common here, would definitely be a very good ending to my story of MS. <br />
<br />
<br />
Elizabeth Quigley's investigation, &quot;Scotland's Hidden Epidemic: The truth about MS&quot;, will be broadcast on Wednesday 23 July, on BBC One Scotland at 2245 BST. <br />
 <br />
 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
interesting, rate in Scotland is 1:500, UK rate total is about 1:700, Average across Northern Europe, Northern USA/Canada is 1:1000.<br />
Closer to the equator you get, less it occurs to almost nil, and some ethnic groups have almost no instances of it.<br />
<br />
Old pal of my mum's has severe MS, she can only move her eyes, now and can barely speak. Can't bare visiting her now, as she's a sweet person and it's just horrible seeing her like that :/ <br />
<br />
Most MS sufferers, thankfully, don't get it anywhere near as bad as that.<br />
Another pal of my mum's is a gardener and he pops round every so often to do our front garden (which has nice flowers etc), he has MS, but it's usually just stiffness and being a bit wobbly, except when it flares up.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Tonight I had some delicious green vegetables, but neither of the people I was with knew how to translate it.  Just that it was a plant that grows in the Guangdong region?  They were basically thin green stalks with leaves on the end.  The stalks were about the thickness of spaghetti, and it tasted a little spinachy but the texture was different.  It was drenched in some sort of buttery sauce, so the leaves weren't very leafy.  It reminded me a little bit of Japanese seaweed salad, but it was definitely not seaweed.  <br />
<br />
I'm just wondering if anyone knows what it might be.</div>

			<description><![CDATA[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bodkin_Adams 
 
found this other day on WIki when reading up on miscarriages of justice. 
basically it's believed this doctor killed 160+ people, probably related to defrauding them and involuntary euthanasia (ie, dispatching them rather than easing a painful end)....]]></description>

basically it's believed this doctor killed 160+ people, probably related to defrauding them and involuntary euthanasia (ie, dispatching them rather than easing a painful end).<br />
<br />
Because of political bullshit, involving high officials and fears over doctors and the NHS, the prosecution deliberately buggered the trial!<br />
<br />
bit too much to post it all, but you can read it on the Wiki. <i>Un-bloody-believable!!! </i>:angry:<br />
<br />
FFS...if that bastard had been nailed, Shipman might have been stopped/caught earlier.<br />
<br />
like something out a a bloody fiction novel! :Popcorn:</div>

Bug report I guess, or need some pointers if Gmail is holding them for some reason.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I worry about what it'll be like going from a big fish in a small pond to a fish in a large pond. I'm pretty..umm...eccentric when it comes to my assignments (either out of boredom or attention and desire)...I wonder if there's any place for that at a decent university, and if I'll even inadvertently become <b>more</b> over the top in order to grab the attention I need to succeed and get what I desire.  I pull some pretty questionable things my graduate friends think I'm crazy for in terms of taste...but they end up really getting results and become good pieces of work. <br />
<br />
At any rate, I'm worried about - now - ~seriously~ risking my academic career by being provocative, barbaric, and eccentric. My work so far I'm pretty satisfied with as long as I've stayed interested in it, but I have the feeling that the new environment will make me seem more dangerous than promising. <br />
<br />
So: Fight back? Continue? change? I'm not sure. How dangerous is the ground I walk on?</div>
