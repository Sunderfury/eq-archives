<br />
I want you all to know how much you suck for not playing this game.  I have played everything you all have played and it's not as good as GW2.  <br />
<br />
Now what do I do?  I have nothing left to prove!  I win.</div>

I know you now have to actually claim the SC in the game where you want to use it, but I'm having problems doing that.  When I log into a game, like EQ2, it shows I have 500SC to redeem, but where the redeem button should be, there is a button that says says &quot;Become a member&quot;.<br />
<br />
Doesn't the All Access plan include membership for EQ and EQ2 any more?  Why can't I redeem my SC?  I submitted a ticket, but got a generic response to read the FAQ and I'm not seeing this covered on the FAQ.</div>

			<div class="message">On May 15, 2012, the gates of the Burning Hells opened and Diablo III was unleashed onto the world. Since then, millions of heroes have been created, billions of hours have been spent in games, and trillions of demons have been slaughtered without mercy. We've even released an expansion! To celebrate the game's second anniversary and the community that made it all possible, players who log in to defend Sanctuary this week will receive double Rift Fragments as well as a +100% boost to their chance to find Legendary items. This bonus birthday buff begins in the Americas on Thursday, May 15 at 12:00 a.m. PDT and ends on Thursday, May 22 at 5:00 a.m. PDT.</div>

The goal is to do low level dungeons with unorthodox groups, then probably high level dungeons with regular groups (because 5 warriors and a bard just won't cut it against high level mobs).</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Is anyone else enjoying this game? It's exactly what I wish Diablo 3 had been but wasn't. It pulls no punches and incorporates what PC gaming had by default before gaming became dominated by accountants. LAN Play, Online Play, fully moddable by default, great mod tools, integrated with Steamworks well, etc. It's a great game and when I do find something that is annoying or improvable, I can just *do* it, how novel. I don't have to wait on Jay Wilson to get shit canned for something to unfuck itself, it's a freedom I have by default, without the creator treating its players like three year-olds for having their own ideas. It's so refreshing.</div>
