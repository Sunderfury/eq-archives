		<div>Flordiel minitrees have a &quot;long range stun&quot; that ignores your runes.<br />
So do the Magehunter/Magekiller on Island of Madness.<br />
<br />
The best part about these ? No range.<br />
I've been stunned at 45+ range.<br />
<br />
Anyway about the lady, it happens a LOT..<br />
Mayor Tressam's Snare/DoT or DoT, her DoT  the list is just too long.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit : BTW something i dont think everyone knows....<br />
<br />
There are 4 types of attacks.<br />
<br />
A) Auto-attack : These are the basic melee, and are not affected by runes at all<br />
Also they are not affected by &quot;silence&quot; since they are not &quot;casted&quot;.<br />
<br />
B) Special Attacks : I expect these to be reflected by runes <br />
These cost endurance for players, and are considered as spells (cant use when silenced)<br />
<br />
C) Procs : They can come from Auto-attack or specials.<br />
I know reflect works on them, because Old Targonor skeletons can be stunned for 18sec by runes.<br />
This spell is cast only when in melee, and only when attacked, i expect this to be a &quot;1 charge proc buff&quot;.<br />
<br />
D) Casted Spells : No comment<br />
<br />
<br />
So depending on what type off attack, runes should act differently.<br />
I am still curious about how archery works...<br />
But with the unreliability of runes, you cant know.<br />
<br />
However since melees cant use &quot;specials&quot; when silenced, these specials are considered as &quot;spells&quot;.<br />
So Runes should protect us.</div>

		<div>Few things I wanna say after reading through this thread again.<br />
<br />
I like spells to have pros and cons, it's about having to make choices and value situations, not having everything be good at all times which it seems most people here would prefer. That would only make it more dull, in my opinion. For example the range thing on Flamespear is something you gotta consider before using it, no it's not gonna be good 2 feet from the mob. This spell is a good opener, but that's it, and the way it should be used, again imo. <br />
<br />
A lot of complaints here also on Seradon's star nuke, and I agree with these comments and I'm not sure what this spell is supposed to bring that we didn't have already, other than that it's cold based. <br />
<br />
Also to comment a bit on Emilia's comparison with his Rogue mate, I wouldn't look as much on what other classes have and don't have, but this is just my attitude to playing these games and class balance... Playing a rogue is a very different experience than playing a sorceror, just go with whatever class you're having the most fun with. If the rogue has higher DPS in short fights? Good for him! I'd look for a rogue when I set up groups!<br />
<br />
Last I think sorcerors are in fairly good shape, but there's a few tweaks I'd like to see:<br />
<br />
-All bugs regarding timers, wards and counters must be fixed!<br />
-Forget line needs looked at, this spell appears to do nothing. <br />
-Insight buff castable on others.<br />
-I'd still like to see a 60 or 90 sec DoT for sorcerors, just enough to be worth casting during long fights, also with upcoming raid encounters in mind.</div>

Exept that &quot;Ultra-expensive Opener for Solo&quot; doesnt warrant a spell slot.<br />

Its not about &quot;playing experience&quot; its about class balance.<br />
If in a &quot;fast&quot; group a rogue does 50% more dps, can mez 3-5 mobs, can snare.<br />
Will i be getting a group ? Nope Never<br />

Enchanters never getting groups because everyone had 3H KEI + Self Hastes.<br />

<br />
Very good list.  I find it delightful that many others agree with the proposition that Asaya's Insight should be useable on others.  It would fit so well with the class theme.  <br />
<br />
I also agree that, if more dds are added, they should be innovative and not redundant.  Emilia's <br />
suggestion of &quot;fast brutal expensive spells&quot; would help fill this niche as would an arcane/ice type char that would be similar to the char itself yet have sufficiently different characteristics such as focusing more on the subsequent damage.  <br />
<br />
The class has enough wards and enough crowd control.  What is needed are some tweaks to the damage options and refinement of the anti-magic defense ability and to become more unique.  Self-only junk hopefully is not being contemplated in place of substantive ideas.</div>

This is incorrect. Special Attacks are considered whatever they are flagged as. Melee specials costing endurance are flagged as melee attacks and do work when silenced.<br />

Some classes like the Shaman have specials that cost endurance and are flagged as spells, but those are the exception, and they usually cost energy <b>and </b>endurance.</div>

<br />
Now of course this is not a surprise to anyone, and as i have already said many many<br />
times, if you expected yourself to rune out of a Dragons AE or Dismiss a God you are naive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since Grimoire is MIA, and Cylus will be gone soon, something has to be done.<br />
I will be sending an email to someone in SoE to talk to him about a huge part<br />
of our class that will become useless with raids..<br />

				The sorcerer class is build around 2 core ideas : DPS + Caster Disruption.<br />
This is why we have skills as Nulling/Reflective Wards and Reflect/Dismiss<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><font color="red">A) Spell Runes</font></b><br />
<br />
For a long long time, sorcerers used to have 2 spell runes/wards.<br />
Nulling Ward &amp; Reflective Ward.<br />
<br />
These were single target wards that either &quot;nulled&quot; or &quot;reflected&quot; a spell.<br />
I do not remember the manacost, but the casting time was 3.0 seconds.<br />
<br />
You could &quot;prebuff&quot; the entire group, and thus protect them from 2 spells.<br />
But it would take 24 to 36 seconds to do that.<br />
<br />
At some point, the wards were changed in theory for the better.<br />
They became &quot;Group Nulling Ward&quot; and &quot;Group Reflective Ward&quot; <br />
with a casting time of 6.0 seconds. <br />
<br />
Which means that with the adequate setup, a sorcerer can do a FULL group<br />
Warding every 3 seconds. <br />
 <br />
Quite Obviously, this just killed all the AEs in the game.<br />
(This was already a very overpowered for single group content, <br />
but vs a Dragon 4 sorcerer in 4 groups = AE totally negated). <br />
<br />
All the mobs we tested yesturday ignored my runes.<br />
The &quot;Curse Guy&quot; has a DoT and a Curse, both which ignored my runes<br />
The &quot;2 Adds Guy&quot; has an AE Stun, which ignored my runes <br />
I did not see any spells for X99, but they will probably be ignored too.<br />
<br />
<br />
This point is very important, because it is with fire/cold/arcane resist<br />
the only buffs a sorcerer has to help a group. We help fight casters.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<b><font color="Red">B) Dismiss/Reflect</font></b><br />
<br />
These two skills are also related to &quot;caster fighting&quot;.<br />
As their name implies they are used to fight casters.<br />
<br />
They work like &quot;Counterspell and Reflect&quot; in Magic the Gathering.<br />
Any spell cast by your target, can be either dismissed, or reflected back to him.<br />
<br />
Again, for all raid mobs we tested yesturday, my Dismiss/Reflect were ignored.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
While it is worth noting that both Wards/Dismiss have been acting unreliably (fubar)<br />
since beta (every sorcerer will tell you they are half bugged), it is clear that <br />
you will have to be na&#239;ve to expect 1 person to be able to &quot;shut down&quot; a dragon.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<b><font color="red">C) Conclusion &amp; Solutions</font></b><br />
<br />
While i am really greatfull towards the person that came up with the idea<br />
it lacks some insight for &quot;real life application&quot;.<br />
 <br />
To be honest, i do not see any solution regarding these skills for a Sorcerer <br />
(at least under their current version).<br />
 <br />
If they are made operationnal in raids, they are very very very overpowered.<br />
And if you make events tuned around them, 4 sorcerer will be mandatory for<br />
maximum Warding speed in every event with AE. <br />
It is the same problem EQ had with &quot;stun&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can probably add gimmick spells/AEs on trash to make<br />
sorcerer secondary function (caster disruptor) usefull, but i dont like gimmicks.<br />
(See Hunter Tranquil Shot in WoW). <br />
This does not help my class, or balance the fact Wards/Dismiss are overpowered.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<font color="Lime"><b>D) The only solution would be a change to the Mechanics of the class.</b></font><br />
<br />
You are not the &quot;Sorcerer&quot; dev, so asking for &quot;class chances&quot; is a long shot.<br />
However, i hope that you may be able to transfer my mail to someone that can look<br />
into this issue, because it is more of a class problem than raid problem. <br />
<br />
What do i propose ?<br />
<br />
Delete Nulling Ward<br />
-&gt; Replace it by a &quot;Single Target Rune Ward&quot; that eats spell damage <br />
   The damage absorbed increases with level (exactly like spellshield).<br />
   Making sure Chaos Volley feedback is ignored by this ward. <br />
   Slow enough be useless for in fight group buffing but fast enough to be usable.<br />
   (Like when we had Wizards do Spellshield rotation in PoTime for Tallon Zek Procs)<br />
<br />
Delete Reflecting Ward<br />
-&gt; Replace it by a &quot;Self Only Rune&quot; <br />
   A copy of the Clicky on : <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3719" target="_blank">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3719</a><br />
   That will help sorcerers be less fragile, and more enduring.<br />
   Making sure Chaos Volley feedback is ignored by this ward.<br />
<br />
Add A Counterspell : Sorcerer's Discretion<br />
-&gt; Aggro will probably be a huge problem in raids. <br />
   Specially because of the 15% miss rate vs lvl53 mobs with full defensive tanks.<br />
   Since we cant expect to Dismiss/Reflect spell cast by bosses, this will help. <br />
   What should it do ? : Channels a bit of the Residual energy left <br />
by your target's spell to reduce your hate by X% for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
I do agree that my changes will weaken our class (specially in AE debuff heavy zones),<br />
But if we do not have overpowered abilities, encounters can be tuned easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
Xennumet with a sorcerer is trivial (since silence will almost never land on anyone).<br />
Without a sorcerer its really really tricky (25 sec silence = dead group).<br />

		<div>terrible news indeed.<br />
<br />
what a way to trash such a great system (spell ID) on raids.<br />
<br />
great so we get to see what a raid mob is casting via spell ID but can do nothing about it?<br />
<br />
<font color="Red"><b>Fixing spell counters on raids.</b></font><br />
<br />
<b>#1 all caster classes have spell counters (druid/necro/bm/sorc/psi)<br />
all of them can dismiss the spell being casted.<br />
<br />
#2 Place a spell ID counter # next to the spell being casted.  This would require multiple classes to counter the incomming spell.  Also require different types of spell ID counters.  Also redundant counters are not counted.  IE three druids cant spell counter by themselves, only 1 counter from 1 druid would count.<br />
<br />
#3 Make the cast times on the mob abilities really short like less than 2.0 seconds.<br />
<br />
Example #1<br />
Mob starts to cast nuke of devesation<br />
spell ID fires for any casters who catch it.<br />
1.5s cast time, and requires 4 spell counters to dismiss the nuke.</b><br />
<br />
--Since sorc have disperse/reflect and are more *anti caster/magic* only our 2 counters will count seperatly.  and the other 2 would need to be filled by two other caster classes, IE druid/nec/psi/bm<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<font color="Cyan"><b>Fixing wards for raid content.</b></font><br />
<br />
<font color="Cyan">#1 separate out raid mob abilities into two category's. </font><br />
-Mele ability<br />
-Spell ability<br />
<br />
<font color="Red"><b>Nulling ward </b></font>- dismisses 1 mele ability, the same target can not be affected by nulling ward for another XX seconds (30s 60s ...ect)<br />
<br />
<font color="red"><b>Reflect ward </b></font>- reflects 1 spell ability, the same target can not be affected by reflect ward for another XX seconds (1min -2min - 5min ect)<br />
<br />
<font color="cyan">#2 Create a &quot;lesser&quot; version of each spell ability (IE 90% reduction 95% reduction across the board...ect)</font><br />
<br />
Then when a mob uses a spell ability and it gets reflected, it will hit for the &quot;lesser&quot; version back on the mob.<br />
<br />
<font color="cyan">#3 Allow chromantic barrier to reflect 1 spell ability every 60 seconds (its normal refresh)</font><br />
<br />
--this would give sorcer'ers the ability to ward themselves against an additional spell ability, in keeping with our anti magic theme.<br />
<br />
<font color="Cyan">#4 Fix Chromantic Halo to allow a reduction in the % of incomming spell damage</font><br />
<br />
--This can be anything you guys tune, 5%-10%, 15% ect.  This would be a permenant 60min buff that reduces incomming spell damage from ALL types by a set %.</div>

Nifty idea, but i really doubt they can pull that one off as implementation.<br />
And you can make custom tailored &quot;have-to-counter&quot; spells.<br />

Bah i liked the &quot;old wards&quot; but i think that any type of &quot;negation&quot; is useless.<br />
Ignoring 1 spell is just too powerfull, and if it stayed,<br />
It would lead to &quot;useless AE to strip the rune&quot; mechanic.<br />
The Per X second, i dont know, it limits it but...<br />
<br />
Thats why i thought about Spellshield &amp; Epic_Clicky, because if you took the<br />
time to refresh them, it was worth it. And it was just &quot;extra hp&quot; ...<br />
<br />
Which with CV eating your HP having a rune that will give you a &quot;buffer&quot; would help.<br />
<br />
Also if you left the &quot;runes&quot;, all mob key abilities, would have to &quot;ignore&quot; the runes.<br />
Because they would be useless_key_abilities otherwise or just keep recasting it.</div>

I dont play a cleric.  I also have never seen a 1 hour long group ward come from one of them.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about making our wards useful for raids.  <br />
<br />
Here's how I see them working out with the changes I've given.<br />
<br />
#1 we can give 1 AE avoid to our group within 10m vs mele abilities every XX seconds (devs can specify length)<br />
#2 we can give 1 AE avoid to our group within 10m vs spell abilities every XX seconds (devs can specify)<br />
<br />
This is a great comprimise to our wards for raid and group/solo, and the best part is mechanics to change it are already in place (lockout on recasting abilities in xx amount of time)<br />
<br />
<br />
To emilia, <br />
They can design around it like you suggested by making pulse ae's or by putting in a crap attack justbefore a big one, but then again we would be the only class capable of doing so, and then only within the limits they set.<br />
<br />
Hell it could be once per 5 min (once per fight)  we all know that AE's are generally timed / scripted and go off many times per fight  reducing one AE or attack or power drain, or raid debuff, is not that important in the grand scheme of things.</div>

Dont missunderstand me, i love having two &quot;get out of jail&quot; cards for my group.<br />
But under their current form, they are just too powerfull.<br />
<br />
<u><i>If you make spell bypass the wards, you are making the entire mechanic useless for when it will matter the most.<br />
If you make &quot;junk spells&quot;, its because you cant balance the wards.</i></u><br />
<br />
Thats why Wizard spellshield (soaks spell X damage before fading) and <br />
Enchanter spellshield (reduces spell damage by Y) are a viable solution.<br />
You could even add a &quot;Self Only 1 Damage Rune&quot; like Staff of the Four.<br />
It will not prevent a dot/debuff, but it will soak/reduce/annul the 1st tick.<br />
<br />
I mean if Quarm's AE bypassed spellshield, there wouldnt be any reason for the spell to exist right ?<br />
<br />
And Vanguards SpellShield (Wards) are just way too powerfull.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its the exact problem with Dismiss/Reflect too powerfull to be used on &quot;bosses&quot;<br />
thus made useless when they are really needed.<br />
<br />
Anyone could stun a Froglok Guk Shaman to prevent it from casting CH/Gate.<br />
But when a raidboss like the SSRA High Priest decided to CH ... well tought luck !</div>

<br />
the point is you cant just re-cast it every 3 seconds, thats what makes it overpowered for raids.<br />
<br />
the fact that you can negate 1 or 2 ae, isn't overpowered at all, if you combine that with a re-use penalty, it allows for stratigic use of an ability.<br />
<br />
thats why they have the stipulation *can not be affected again for xx* seconds.<br />
<br />
I still dont see your point about it being overpowered.<br />
<br />
In EQ2 there were a lot of classes that had abilities that would avoid mobs AE's or any abilities that did not directly target them, and quite a few had group wide AE avoid's on re-use timers.<br />
<br />
it was in no way shape or form overpowered.  You could kill the mobs without said classes, and you could kill mobs with said classes with coordination a little easier.</div>
