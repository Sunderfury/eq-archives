				<div style="font-style:italic">It is a mystery of pint-sized proportions, featuring an altruistic act of kindness copied straight from the film Amélie, which tells the story of a Parisian waitress who decides to change the lives of those around her for the better.<br />
<br />
The story begins seven months ago, with the seemingly random abduction of a garden gnome from the property of a Gloucester pensioner, Eve Stuart-Kelso. After noticing its absence, the grandmother of three presumed it had been stolen, and soon forgot all about it.<br />
<br />
Yet last week, she opened her front door to find the missing leprechaun, which she had nicknamed Murphy, staring up at her. Beside the battered garden ornament lay a tightly wrapped parcel, containing an album of 48 photos showing him engaging in daring activities at exotic locations all over the globe.<br />
<br />
Murphy was pictured abseiling down a mountain, standing in the mouth of a shark, swimming and riding a motorbike. Immigration stamps from the 12 countries he had visited – including South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand and Vietnam – were also attached, proving the authenticity of the trip.<br />
<br />
The gnome's abductor also left a note, written from Murphy's perspective, explaining the reasons for his prolonged absence and detailing the trouble he had incurred at the hands of bothersome customs officials. He wrote that sitting in Mrs Stuart-Kelso's garden all day had given him &quot;itchy feet&quot;, and that he had left to seek adventure in other parts of the world.<br />
<br />
The note read: &quot;I came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic, and allowing passing cats to urinate on you. There have been high points, low points and positively terrifying points. But I have survived.&quot;<br />
<br />
A group of young men who feature in some of the photographs would appear to be those responsible for the prank, but the identity of Murphy's guardian and travelling companion – who is referred to only as &quot;The Bear&quot; – remains unknown.<br />
<br />
The globetrotting stunt was copied directly from the 2001 film Amélie, starring Audrey Tautou, in which the eponymous heroine's father also has his garden gnome abducted. After receiving similarly exotic pictures of his absent ornament, he realises what he is missing out on in life and embarks on a world tour of his own.<br />
<br />
Mrs Stuart-Kelso, who works as a tour guide for the Civic Trust, described the dramatic return of her ornament as the &quot;strangest gift&quot; she had ever received.<br />
<br />
She said: &quot;I just keep thinking how funny it is. It makes me smile to see all the people he met on his travels. It was a wonderful surprise and of course it's so nice to get some good news. The story really is unbelievable. It was a beautifully written letter. The intriguing thing is that someone had gone to such trouble to do this for a complete stranger,&quot; she added. Murphy is now proudly back on display in the pensioner's garden, and is unharmed apart from a pair of missing feet – an injury thought to have been suffered during his abseiling adventures.<br />
<br />
Mrs Stuart-Kelso said that her three grandchildren were thrilled to hear of the gnome's travels, and were looking forward to giving the ornament a fresh lick of paint.<br />
<br />
But a spokeswoman for Gloucestershire police failed to see the funny side of the prank. &quot;Any theft of a person's property, even if it is carried out as a joke, will be treated as a crime by police,&quot; she said. &quot;What may seem like a laugh to one person can cause distress to another.&quot;</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Is coming out in a few days for PSN and PC and I think is out now for Xbox Live. Anyone else looking forward to this?<br />
<br />
The first Bionic Commando was one of those golden NES games for me. Rearmed is more or less a 10 dollar remake with 3D graphics, new bosses, new weapons, levels, and other assorted tweaks. Each version is supposed to get something unique. I don't know what Live gets, but the PSN version gets PSP remote play, which should be pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Sometime next year I believe the fully 3D &quot;sequel&quot; is supposed to come out, basically a third person shooter with swing mechanics.<br />
<br />
<br />
For anyone that has never heard of it, Bionic Commando is a platformer without jumping. Instead you had this bionic arm that you used to attach to various surfaces and swing and climb.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I need to get a simple LLC for myself for a Storage Unit structure I'm buying.  I'll be the only person associated with the LLC.<br />
<br />
I called a local lawyer (I live in TheMiddleOfNowhere, PA), and she quoted me $375 for the preparation, and $150 for the state fees.<br />
<br />
I'm cool with the price - but she said that she wasn't available for another two weeks to discuss the particulars, and it would take 3 weeks after that to have the LLC formed.  That's <b>FIVE WEEKS</b> if screw-off time on her part that's preventing me from closing.<br />
<br />
After brewing about that for a few minutes, I remembered that I saw LLC advertised on Legalzoom.com.  I went to that site, and their BEST LLC 'package' is $350 + the state fees.<br />
<br />
I called a few other craptacular law firms, and they were either expensive ($1000), or unwilling to give firm dates.<br />
<br />
Is there any downside to using a website for this procedure?  Is there any upside to using a local lawyer?  All I really need is to get my EIN Number.<br />
<br />

My email has been getting absolutely hammered with false &quot;CNN News Alert!&quot; emails.  The spam filter catches a lot of them, but quite a few still get through.  Counting the ones in the spam filter, I seem to get 20-30 a day.  I opened one out of curiosity, and there was a blurb and a &quot;link&quot; to CNN.  Of course, after manually browsing the CNN website, I could not find the story in question.  And then there's also the issue I've never signed up for a CNN News Alert emails.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Bit of an odd idea, but:<br />
<br />
I think having a formatting option for &quot;emotional tone&quot; or &quot;writer's intent&quot;, would be a good idea.<br />
<br />
While smiley's help, many folk don't use them or clues to get how their post is intended. Sometime it's obvious, but sometimes it's not, causing confusion, which leads to frustration, <font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="DarkGreen">which leads to anger, which leads to hate, which leads to sufffering!!</font></font><br />
(that's Yoda emotional tone! :p)<br />
<br />
Mere words never express as much as the presence and face of the actual writer, as so much is conveyed by expression of their face and posture.<br />
Sounds silly, but obviously when a declaration of war is written with a smile on yer face, it's not serious...ya know?<br />
<br />
Being British *waggles kilty bum!* :p, , we tend to be very silly and can use silence or inflection with huge variety.<br />
<br />
I've had this concept for ages, but playing VtM: Bloodlines, with it's use of colour and fonts to convey specific text choices (for seduction, coercion and persuasion), semed a great way to do it.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="Plum">This text is meant ot be silly and fun!</font></font><br />
<br />
<font face="Impact"><font color="Red">This text is meant to be sarcastic</font>!</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Arial Black"><font color="DarkOrange">This text is meant to be crazy!</font></font><br />
<br />
get what I mean? :)</div>
