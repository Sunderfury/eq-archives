			GLENDALE, Calif., Feb. 1, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (Nasdaq: DWA) today announced that it will bring the well-loved Sid &amp; Marty Krofft characters from the 1970's television series Lidsville to the big screen in a feature film by the same name. <br />
<br />
Conrad Vernon (Monsters vs. Aliens, Shrek 2) — animation veteran and lifelong fan of the Krofft's work — brought the project to DreamWorks Animation. Brothers Sid &amp; Marty Krofft will serve as executive producers. Vernon, DreamWorks Animation's head of development Alex Schwartz and development executive Chris Kuser are overseeing the project at the studio.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sid and I have had a longstanding relationship with Jeffrey Katzenberg and we're excited to bring Lidsville to DreamWorks Animation,&quot; said Marty Krofft. &quot;It's incredible to envision a high-quality 3D animated movie being made out of one of our favorite shows.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The Krofft brothers helped define a generation with the wildly imaginative characters and worlds they created,&quot; said Alex Schwartz, head of development for DreamWorks Animation. &quot;I am thrilled that Conrad is joining forces with them on the first animated feature film adaptation of their work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over the past year I've had the privilege of working with and getting to know Sid and Marty and I thought their brand of crazy kookiness would work well at DreamWorks Animation,&quot; added Vernon.<br />
<br />
Lidsville will take inspiration from the premise of the original television series, in which a young rebellious kid falls into an alternate reality world of living hats and talking caps. The Los Angeles public TV station KCET Kids &amp; Family Channel recently announced that it will feature the Lidsville television series in an all-new &quot;The Sid &amp; Marty Krofft Hour&quot; together with H.R. Pufnstuf during its weekend programming block on Saturday and Sunday mornings from 9:30-10:30 a.m.

		<hr />
		
			 <b>Upheavals in Egypt and across the Middle East are shaking a major foundation of American foreign policy: the conviction that arms sales and military strength ensure stability.</b><br />
<br />
From Algeria to Yemen, throngs of chronically unemployed youth are upending U.S.-backed regimes heavily armed with American military hardware and expertise. In a region where half the population is under the age of 25 and increasingly desperate for jobs and scarce housing, the United States has provided more than $250 billion worth of weaponry since 1950, vastly overshadowing its investments in education, job creation, housing, democracy and other social needs.<br />
<br />
In Cairo, the Egyptian army suggested it would not interfere with Tuesday's planned massive demonstrations and general strike. In a statement, the military said it supported &quot;freedom of expression through peaceful means.''<br />
<br />
<b>But the United States, for its decades-long effort to avoid trouble by fortifying Egypt's military at the expense of funding for education, jobs and housing, seemed to be on the wrong side of history. As former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice lamented in a remarkable speech at American University in Cairo in 2005, &quot;For 60 years, the United States pursued stability at the expense of democracy in the Middle East -- and we achieved neither.''</b><br />
<br />
As <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/experts/hamids.aspx" target="_blank">Shadi Hamid</a>, a Middle East scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington, wrote this week: &quot;For decades, the United States has prioritized a now clearly illusory stability over American ideals. It appears the administration, slowly, is realizing its mistake -- and that of its predecessors.''<br />
<br />
In an opinion essay for Forbes, Hamid added: &quot;Democracy -- with the accountability, popular legitimacy and peaceful resolution of conflict it so often brings -- is the only avenue to long-term stability. Otherwise, authoritarian regimes will appear stable -- until they're not.''<br />
<br />
More immediately, there is concern that the massive U.S. investment in Egypt's powerful military may become uncontrollable. A new, more radical civilian regime could abrogate Egypt's peace treaty with Israel and wield its military as a new threat to the region's relative peace. &quot;Somebody in Washington needs to be working seriously on the future security of Israel,'' said John McCreary, former intelligence watch officer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. &quot;There is no guarantee that an anti-Israel Islamist government will not emerge, in the revolutionary phase of this uprising . . . large scale, conventional warfare with tanks would re-establish itself as the future of warfare'' in the region.<br />
<br />
<b>U.S. largesse has made Egypt's military a force to contend with. Last year the United States provided Egypt with $2.6 billion in military hardware and services, including sophisticated anti-ship and anti-tank missiles, fast missile boats and upgrades to Sparrow air-to-air missiles that the Pentagon said would contribute to &quot;political stability and economic progress in the Middle East.'' Of that amount, $1.3 billion was written off as U.S. military aid.</b><br />
<br />
Commercial military sales to Egypt, supervised by the State Department, were expected to reach at least tens of millions of dollars more. In the most recent year reported, 2008, commercial sales of weapons to Egypt came to $121 million.<br />
<br />
Last year the United States also gave Egypt $1.5 billion in non-military assistance – of which $1.3 billion was earmarked for &quot;peace, security and stability'' programs including counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics and &quot;stabilization'' initiatives. There was also money for &quot;democracy, human rights and governance'' ($25 million) and for education and social and economic development ($210 million).<br />
<br />
<b>That ratio of U.S. support -- $2.6 billion in direct military sales and $235 million for democracy, human rights, education and economic development – faithfully reflects long-standing and continuing U.S. strategy.</b><br />
<br />
The central idea was captured in a 2009 remark reportedly made by Gen. David Petraeus, who was then the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, to Hosni Mubarak. The Egyptian president was complaining that Iranian agents were working to destabilize Egypt from the inside. According to a U.S. diplomatic cable leaked by WikiLeaks, Petraeus suggested he could help by providing more Patriot missiles and F-16 fighters. Whether Mubarak inquired how missiles and jets could help control political unrest wasn't recorded.<br />
<br />
But across the volatile Middle East, U.S. arms sales are accelerating, with a potential new sale pending to Saudi Arabia worth as much as $60 billion. An analysis by Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies mentions three key advantages of the sale: securing access to Saudi oil, building up a potential U.S. military partner in the region, and making future Saudi regimes dependent on the U.S. for spare parts and technical assistance for their American weapons systems.<br />
<br />
No one suggests that non-military U.S. assistance could cure the ills of the Middle East. But a better balance between military and non-military aid might help in a region under such stress. One major cause of instability is the growing population of those under 25, which according to data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau, ranges from 50 percent in Saudi Arabia to 64.9 percent in Yemen, another U.S. military ally challenged by street uprisings.<br />
<br />
Despite spending heavily on defense, the region's governments for the most part have failed to provide private-sector jobs for new high school and college graduates. In Egypt, 600,000 of them a year pour into the job market, faster than retirements and job creation can make room for, according to a recent report by the U.N. Development Program. Officially, one in four Egyptian youths is unemployed. Rising food prices, due in part to crops wilting in unusual heat, added to the misery: the price of vegetables doubled in Cairo this fall, according to a UN report.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mubarak has gotten $30 billion or $40 billion in U.S. military aid during his time in office, and that could have gone a long way in health, education, agriculture – even if you took only half of it,'' said William Hartung, an arms sales and foreign aid analyst at the New America Foundation, a Washington think tank. Even at the margins, Hartung said, &quot;if you helped raise living standards and gave people more options, I think the government would have a little more breathing room.''<br />
<br />
Yet the imbalance between what the United States spends on foreign aid and military and security aid is anchored in the Obama administration's national security strategy, published last May. It acknowledged that the United States must deal with &quot;the underlying political and economic deficits that foster instability, enable radicalization and extremism and ultimately undermine the ability of governments to manage threats within their borders.'' To deal with these threats, the White House paper said, &quot;We will undertake long-term, sustained efforts to strengthen the capacity of security forces to guarantee internal security . . .''<br />
<br />
<b>Accordingly, the administration's proposed 2011 international affairs budget, which finances all foreign operations and foreign aid, including disaster relief, was $58.4 billion. The proposed spending bill for the Defense Department: $708 billion.</b>

			<div class="message">Kepler's ultimate goal is to find a twin, in both size and in distance from its star, of Earth — an orbital sweet spot known as a star's habitable zone. That's because astronomers assume these are likeliest places for alien life to have taken hold. The telescope hasn't quite done that yet, but the Kepler team has just announced a huge flock of candidate planets, pushing its total catch so far to more than 1,200. If they all indeed turn out to be planets, it will more than triple the number of known worlds orbiting distant stars — and that's just in a tiny patch of sky, and relatively close to Earth. <br />
<br />
Last month, Kepler reported a world only about 40% larger than Earth — a very big deal since most of the planets identified have been Jupiter-scale worlds. But that's nothing: among the latest candidates are 68 worlds about the size of Earth, including a handful that are no bigger than Mars. Five of these, moreover, lie in the habitable zone. The other 49 planets Kepler found in habitable zones are bigger, but, as Kepler principal investigator Bill Borucki pointed out, &quot;some are as big as Jupiter, which means their moons could have liquid water&quot; — a crucial ingredient, biologists think, for life.... <br />
<br />
Borucki, who was turned down by NASA four times before getting the go-ahead to build and launch Kepler, cautions that some of these new worlds might turn out not to be planets after all. Plenty of astronomical signals can look deceptively planet-like at first. They all have to be confirmed — ideally by measuring the object's mass with a second telescope. That's usually done by observing the slight wobble in the star caused by the tug of the orbiting planet's gravity. <br />
<br />
Only a handful of Kepler's planets have passed that test so far. In part that's because there's such a huge volume of data coming in from the space probe, and only a limited number of astronomers on the Kepler team who can do the followups. By releasing the candidates to the wider astronomical community, the team will be able to get these confirmations a lot faster — although with only four months' worth of Kepler's 18-months of data processed so far, the backlog may get bigger before it gets smaller.</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div> I can't wait to see NASA's budget be partially restored once they confirm even one Earth-sized planet in a habitable zone.</div>

			Wealth gap widens between super rich and rest  <br />
<br />
 <br />
As the global economy has grown, the gap between rich and poor has increased<br />
<br />
By Chrystia Freeland <br />
Global Editor-at-Large of Reuters  <br />
<br />
<br />
Alan Greenspan - the legendary chairman of the United States' Federal Reserve - is the high priest of free market capitalism. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Alan Greenspan was a convert of Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism <br />
As a young man he was even a devotee and acolyte of arch libertarian writer, Ayn Rand. <br />
<br />
Keep that pedigree in mind when you consider the striking observation he made in a television interview last summer: <br />
<br />
&quot;Our problem basically is that we have a very distorted economy, in the sense that there has been a significant recovery in our limited area of the economy amongst high-income individuals... <br />
<br />
&quot;Large banks, who are doing much better and large corporations, whom you point out and everyone is pointing out, are in excellent shape. The rest of the economy, small business, small banks, and a very significant amount of the labour force, which is in tragic unemployment, long-term unemployment - that is pulling the economy apart. The average of those two is what we are looking at - that they are fundamentally two separate types of economies.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mr Greenspan is right, of course, and not just about the US. Over the past three decades, the world economy has been reshaped by two mega-trends. <br />
<br />
One is a surge in the size and connectedness of international markets. <br />
<br />
Widening gap<br />
<br />
This has created a burst of global prosperity that has lifted hundreds of millions out of absolute poverty and into the middle class, particularly in the rising Asian power-houses of China and India. <br />
<br />
<br />
 But even as the global economy has grown overall, within countries, the gap between rich and poor has increased. <br />
<br />
This winner-take-all phenomenon has been particularly stark in the US, where, between 2002 and 2007, 65% of all income growth went to the top 1% of the population. <br />
<br />
But the divide has also widened in Britain, Canada, Germany and Scandinavia. <br />
<br />
It has increased in the booming emerging markets, too - communist China now has a gap between rich and poor as big as that of the laissez-faire US. <br />
<br />
This split between the super-rich and everyone else prompted three Citigroup analysts to conclude that &quot;the world is dividing into two blocs - the plutonomy and everyone else&quot;. <br />
<br />
As they explained in a 2005 report: In a plutonomy there is no such animal as &quot;the US consumer&quot; or &quot;the UK consumer&quot;, or indeed the &quot;Russian consumer&quot;. <br />
<br />
'Small bites'<br />
<br />
There are rich consumers, few in number, but disproportionate in the gigantic slice of income and consumption they take. <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Political and industry leaders gathered in Davos last week <br />
There are the rest, the &quot;non-rich&quot;, the multitudinous many, but only accounting for surprisingly small bites of the national pie. <br />
<br />
Through my work as a business journalist, I have spent the better part of the past decade shadowing these plutocrats - attending the same exclusive conferences in Europe, conducting interviews over cappuccinos on Martha's Vineyard or in Silicon Valley meeting rooms, observing high-powered dinner parties in Manhattan. <br />
<br />
Some of what I have learned is entirely predictable - the rich are, as F Scott Fitzgerald famously noted, &quot;different from you and me&quot;. <br />
<br />
What is more relevant to our times, though, is that the rich of today are also different from the rich of yesterday. <br />
<br />
For the most part, today's plutocrats are not a leisured, landed gentry of inherited wealth. <br />
<br />
John Stuart Mill's complaint about the super-elite of his era - that, like the Duke of Bedford, they grew rich in their sleep - does not much apply to today's nerdy, workaholic, perpetually jet-lagged plutocrats. <br />
<br />
Modern plutocracy<br />
<br />
Emmanuel Saez, an award winning economist who is one of the premier students of the super-elite, has found that in 1916, the richest 1% of Americans received only one-fifth of their income from paid work. <br />
<br />
In 2004, that figure had tripled, to 60%. <br />
<br />
Many of today's plutocrats are the beneficiaries of globalisation. And even those who made their money at home have figured out that to make more they need to embrace the global economy. <br />
<br />
As a result, they are becoming a trans-global community of peers who have more in common with one another than with their countrymen back home. <br />
<br />
Whether they maintain primary residences in New York or Hong Kong, Moscow or Mumbai, today's super-rich are increasingly a nation unto themselves. <br />
<br />
One of the places where that nation meets up is in Davos, Switzerland, at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF). <br />
<br />
But this year, even the WEF, the premier convener of the global super-elite, is worried that income inequality has grown too extreme. <br />
<br />
&quot;Economic disparity and global governance failures both influence the evolution of many other global risks and inhibit our capacity to respond effectively to them,&quot; the forum's Global Risks report for this year's conference notes. <br />
<br />
&quot;In this way, the global risk context in 2011 is defined by a 21 Century paradox: as the world grows together, it is also growing apart.&quot; <br />
<br />
So, here lies the dilemma. In today's hyper competitive global economy we need our super rich and the innovative companies they create more than ever. But they need us too - as consumers, as employees, as fellow citizens. <br />
<br />
But here is the lesson of history. In the long run super elites can only survive in one of two ways - by suppressing dissent, or by sharing the wealth. <br />
<br />
I know which one I prefer. <br />
<br />
Watch Newsnight's Rich Night on Wednesday 2 February 2011 at 10.30pm on BBC Two, and then afterwards on the BBC iPlayer and Newsnight website. <br />

<br />
I have been sick for the past five days now, nauseous and puking; I think my father gave me some sort of stomach flu.. bug.. Thing. So I've felt like shit for quite a while now. However, an outlet is my girlfriend, who's always extremely sweet, etc.. But the problem is she's long distance. So it's not like she's bringing thermoses of soup to my door or anything. But she does the best she can. She's coming up to my house this weekend, staying the weekend, and we were really excited, as we don't get to see eachother much.. Once a month at most. So we were excited for the physical and the non-physical things that would occur. However, today she informed me that she got her period. Which I honestly expected, but it still annoyed me, because there goes any physical things that can happen. However, I'm afraid to even make out with her or whatever, seeing as I'm not sure where the line is as to what she wants to do. But that can be figured out. On top of that, she will be away Valentine's day weekend, so we're having our own mock Valentine's day this weekend, and I'm completely blanked for presents, which is bad as she's coming on Friday. So I need to figure that out, while simultaneously feeling like shit because I'm going to be alone on Valentine's day as usual. And all of this is beginning to affect me to the point where I'm acting strangely, but she's not picking it up, and I'm being obnoxious, but I can't help it. And my parents are yelling at me for no reason than they're pissed at eachother, my mother has threatened to beat me to a &quot;bloody pulp&quot; more than once, and I don't know what to do, I can't sing, can't play guitar, don't want to do ANYTHING at all. And now I have fingernail marks on my left arm because I was holding all of this inside and just digging my nails into my arm. So there's my rant. <br />
Wonderful.</div>

This is the second or third stem cell innovation I've heard of in the last year - it even uses <b>adult</b> stem cells from the patient himself, and I bet it won't be funded due to controversy or politics.<br />

I thought newspaper companies should have embraced the internet years ago and offered cheaper subscriptions for online reading and be included if you have an actual paper come to your house.

			 By Jennifer Saba and Yinka Adegoke – 1 hr 22 mins ago<br />
NEW YORK (Reuters) -News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch, among the most ardent defenders of the traditional press, launched the first ever newspaper created solely for tablet devices like the iPad.<br />
Murdoch, along with Apple Inc executive Eddy Cue, introduced the Daily during a Wednesday event at the Solomon Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.<br />
The Daily, a general news product available to iPad users in the United States that covers everything from national politics to sports, will cost 14 cents a day, 99 cents a week or $39.99 a year. It will be billed directly to a user's iTunes account. The first two weeks will be free courtesy of Verizon Communications.<br />
News Corp is making a big bet that starting a newspaper from scratch that is dedicated to tablet devices could help revive the news industry, which is beset by declining readership and advertising revenue. Just three years ago, Murdoch spent close to $6 billion buying Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal.<br />
To date, Murdoch said, the company had spent around $30 million developing the Daily. He said it would cost less than $500,000 a week to run before revenue from advertisers and subscriptions. He added that he would measure his success by &quot;selling millions&quot; of subscriptions.<br />
&quot;Our ambitions are very big, but our costs are very low.&quot;<br />
The Daily is being closely watched in media circles for signs that consumers will pay for online news.<br />
&quot;It helps us answer the big question of 2011,&quot; said Ken Doctor, an analyst with Outsell Research. &quot;Can you charge for (online) general news?&quot;<br />

The New Royals: Insight on Prince William &amp; Kate Middleton's wedding<br />
Full coverage of the royal wedding on Yahoo! News<br />
Complete entertainment coverage<br />
At 99 cents per week, News Corp needs to sell around 250,000 annual subscriptions to break even, Doctor estimated. &quot;That's a lot,&quot; he said.<br />
Editor Jesse Angelo said the Daily will be published every morning with stories told through text, photos and HD video and would have its own voice.<br />
News Corp's chief digital officer, Jon Miller, said the Daily will be competing for attention with a range of news, games and other media services.<br />
&quot;You're competing with Angry Birds on some level,&quot; Miller said, referring to the wildly successful iPhone-based video game.<br />
The Daily marks Apple's inauguration of a subscription platform in the iTunes store for apps.<br />
For a year, Apple and magazine and newspaper publishers have been in talks about selling subscriptions through the iTunes store and have not made progress.<br />
Apple's Cue said his company will soon make an announcement on subscription services for other publishers.<br />
The main sticking point is control of subscriber data, said sources who did not want to be identified because they are still in negotiations.<br />
Aside from taking a 30 percent cut of revenue from subscriptions within the iTunes store, Apple wants to be the guardian of customer information.<br />
Publishers are particularly protective of subscriber data such as names, addresses and credit cards, which helps them court advertisers and market new products to existing readers.<br />
&quot;The subscription stuff is the real story, and Apple really did not give us any new information on what the subscription is going to look like,&quot; said Gartner analyst Allen Weiner. &quot;It didn't answer any of our questions. This doesn't just impact the Daily, it impacts the entire news business.&quot;<br />
Apple has allowed some newspapers for instance to work around the iTunes store for a subscription plan. The Wall Street Journal and Pearson Plc's Financial Times, both of which have online pay models attached to their websites, provide subscriptions outside the iTunes store.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>My child from previous marriage has turned 19 and graduated from high school. I should be able to end my child support payments. My attorney in RI said she would submit paperwork for the amazingly low low fee of $2000. Unfortunately being poor and unemployed I can't afford her nominal fee. <br />
<br />
Question: Can I file these documents myself and if so where would I obtain them from? Do I need to be present or can I mail them in?<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</div>
