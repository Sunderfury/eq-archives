Further, I tested to see what the actual crit% of a fully AA'd wizard is, as well as tried to deduce what the innate crit% is.<br />
<br />
Boiled down, what I found was that:<br />
<br />
Innate Criticals ~ 2.3%<br />
Full AA ~ 18%<br />
DoN Crit AA ~ 1%<br />
<br />
<br />
Test 1, two wizards 100% comparable in critical AA skills, test on Katta Bankers using Rains (Icestrike and Firestorm, low level because of low manacost). <br />
<br />
Doopsy (doesn't have AA, nor DoN) <br />
Aauminki (has AA) <br />
<br />
Aauminki hit the Helsins 5,906 times - 1,259 critical hits = 21.32% <br />
Doopsy hit the Helsins 5,940 times - 1,202 critical hits = 20.24% <br />
<br />
Test is still running, I'll post the results of the next few hours later. <br />
<br />
Since rains aren't affected by focus, the critical hits from AA skills can be tagged easily as 63 and 103 hits. Since the bankers resisted a total of 0 spells out of the ~12k posted above, I believe it's safe to assume they can't really resist anything and conjecture that all critical hits that aren't for 2.25x one of the base hits are innates. <br />
<br />
Aauminki &quot;supposed&quot; innate crits (1259-1118) = 141 - 2.39% <br />
Doopsy &quot;supposed&quot; innate crits (1202-1071) = 131 - 2.21% <br />
<br />
The hypothesis now could then be that: <br />
<br />
Innate crits make up about 2.30% <br />
AA-skills (SCF3, SCFM3, FoMM2, AFoMM2) make up about 18% <br />
DoN Crit-AA make up about 1%<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Then later, I went back and parsed some more:<br />
<br />
Continued from Test1 above. <br />
<br />
Aauminki - 9,532 hits - 2,026 crits (216 innate) 21.25% (2.27% innate) <br />
Doopsy - 9,604 hits - 1,952 crits (217 innate) 20.32% (2.26% innate) <br />
<br />
Continued Test1 above (except that it didn't log Aauminki, so only have data from Doopsy).<br />
<br />
Doopsy - 21,132 hits - 4,271 crits (493 innate) 20.21% (2.33% innate)</div></div><hr />
