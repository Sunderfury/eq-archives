Additional Patch Notes <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Guild Halls <br />
<br />
NOTE: Guild Halls will not be available until AFTER the server merges, to avoid plot conflicts. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guild Hall quests are now available! They operate in a similar manner to regular housing in regards to overall construction but require new components. Building a Guild Hall will require efforts from all three spheres of Vanguard. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guild Hall plots will not be available for purchase until after the server merge. But the quests will be live so you can begin acquiring the resources necessary to construct one. The server merge is expected to happen a week after GU2 goes live. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Crafters will need to learn brand new recipes for all three continents. There are new quests for different key parts of the Guild Hall structure, the majority which are for the mineralogist specialization. Other crafting trades will have some component recipes as well though. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Among the new recipes, a special mortar assembly recipe is introduced. This recipe requires components obtained from high level adventuring areas. Fetching these items will be very dangerous. You will want to bring a group. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Diplomats will now be needed to obtain permissions to purchase the Guild Hall plot. Without the correct documents obtained from the local government, the guild leader will not be allowed to purchase the plot. Obtaining this documentation will not be a simple task. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finishing construction of a Guild Hall will take much more investment than building a smaller house due to the sheer size and space. However, once completed, they will be a great place for your guild to gather and store treasures, in addition to being a mark of pride for your group! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
· Must be Guild Leader to purchase <br />
<br />
· Must form a full group of guild members and have them be in the same zone. (6) <br />
<br />
· Must have completed the diplomacy quest and have the diplomacy item in the Guild Leaders inventory. <br />
<br />
· Purchasing the plot will expend the diplomacy item. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. The Brotherhood System <br />
<br />
NOTE: The Brotherhood System will not be available until AFTER the server merges. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Brotherhoods are a method for you and your friends to gain experience for each other, even when some of you are offline. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Brotherhoods will not be going live until after the server merge. The server merge is expected to happen a week after GU2 goes live. <br />
<br />
Features <br />
<br />
· All experience you earn is split amongst the members of the fellowship, even members who are offline. <br />
<br />
· When you are in debt or have lost experience, your experience will be devoted to repaying your debt/loss before you resume contributing to the brotherhood. <br />
<br />
· Brotherhoods are completely independent from groups; you can be a member of both at the same time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Limitations <br />
<br />
Brotherhoods can have a maximum of six members. <br />
You must be within five levels of every member of the brotherhood in order to join. <br />
You must be within a few meters distance to invite a player to your brotherhood. <br />
If you leave your brotherhood or are removed, you may not join another one for four hours of online played time. <br />
Members who are offline do not receive their experience until they log on. (Be careful when using the system to level up rarely-played characters, as their skills will fall behind, thus they will be very weak for their levels!) <br />
<br />
Getting Started <br />
Interested in creating a brotherhood? Simply target your friend, right click your defensive target window, and select &quot;Invite to Brotherhood.&quot; You may then administer the brotherhood from the social window (default key 'O') &quot;Brotherhood&quot; tab. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Bind on Equip <br />
<br />
All equipable items that were bindable are now either bind on equip or bind on pickup, with the majority of the items being bind on equip. Here is a quick overview of the affected items: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
· All equipable items that were bindable are now BOE or BOP <br />
<br />
· All uncommon and common items are BOE <br />
<br />
· All rare world loot items are BOE <br />
<br />
· All rare (and higher) items that are not on world loot tables are BOP <br />
<br />
· All containers are BOE <br />
<br />
· Quest rewards will remain soulbound as they were before this change <br />
<br />
· Any rare items already in the world, that would have become BoP and thus soulbound, will instead become BoE. All new items that drop will be BoP. This will prevent cases where characters could be stuck with items becoming Soulbound that they cant use. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This change was made for a variety of reasons. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Removes items from the functional trade economy after the item has been used once. <br />
Helps regulate economy as items are effectively removed from trade. <br />
Changes to the deconstruction system allows all players regardless of sphere to feel a gain even after they have upgraded items in a slot, we did not feel that binding an item to our customers and presenting them with nothing back for its value was worthwhile. <br />
<br />
<br />
4. LFG Improvements <br />
<br />
There is a new LFG button that is located in the group area of the UI (left side of the screen), which brings up the new looking for group and looking for more tabs of the social window. This will disappear once a player joins someone elses group, but it will remain for group leaders until their group is full. It automatically brings up the LFG tab for non-grouped players, and the LFM tab for group leaders. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The looking for group tab allows players to set which dungeon(s) or quest(s) (from the list of quests that the player currently has in their journal) they would like to work on, and then see a list of other individual players or group leaders. Players and group leaders in the list will be sorted based on their level relationship to you and how closely their preferences match yours, so those that are near your level and are looking to do the same dungeon or quest will be sorted highest in the list. The LFG tab also includes the option to auto accept group invites. If the player doesnt turn on that feature, they will see the name, level, and class of the group leader and the name, level and class of each of the current groups members when they are sent a group invite, at which time they can choose to accept or deny the invite as normal. If a player selects a group leader in the search list, they will get the new option to send a request to join that leaders group, at which point the group leader will see the name, level, and class of the player that is requesting to join the group and the leader can choose to deny the request, or to send a group invite to that player. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The looking for more tab works like the LFG tab, except that it lets a group leader select the archetype(s) and/or class(es) that the group is looking for, in addition to setting the dungeon(s) and/or quest(s) that the group would like to find more members to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Both the LFG and LFM lists show individuals looking for a group and group leaders looking for more members. Hovering the mouse over a player in the list will show more info about them, such as what dungeons or quests they prefer, and if it is a group leader the tooltip will also show what archetypes or classes the group prefers and a list of all of the current group members names, levels, and classes. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Rest Experience <br />
<br />
Heroes may now rest in Vanguard! Resting increases the rate at which a hero will gain adventuring, crafting, or diplomacy experience. As the hero gains experience in a particular sphere, rest of that type is exhausted. Rest for each sphere is separate, and is designated by a blue bar on the character sheet of the corresponding sphere. For adventurers, rest is also displayed on the experience bar. Camping allows a hero to rest, occurring more rapidly at outposts. A hero may tell if he or she is at an outpost when a tower icon appears next to his or her class icon. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Level Based Diplomacy <br />
<br />
Diplomacy is moving from a skill-based (1-500) system to a level-based (1-50) system. In this changeover, your skill will be automatically converted to level. For instance, if you were skill 120, you would now be level 12. If you were 123, then you would be level 12 with 6 bubbles filled. NPCs and items are also converted as well, as will be the difficulty of conversations. This move allows us to fit Diplomacy more easily into creating content for the game, greatly speeding up the way we make content and reducing the places in which bugs can crop up  while also increasing the opportunities for sphere interdependence. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
7. Diplomacy UI <br />
<br />
Several elements in the Diplomacy user interface have been made easier to understand and more intuitive. For instance: <br />
<br />
Double-clicking cards in your Diplomacy strategy during a parlay will now play them as if you selected the card and clicked the &quot;Speak&quot; button. <br />
Cards in your Diplomacy strategy are now dimmed when unusable because they are still refreshing. <br />
<br />
<br />
8. Deconstruction <br />
<br />
Deconstruction is no longer process oriented. Deconstruction kits will be sold by vendors for ten silver and each kit will have ten charges. Right-clicking the kit and then clicking on the item you wish to deconstruct will give you the option to convert the item to a resource or a dust. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Common items should convert into attuning dusts or common resources <br />
Uncommon items should convert into resonance dusts, common resources and sometimes a rare resource <br />
Rare items should convert into focusing dusts, rare resources and sometimes ultra rare resources <br />
Anything above rare follows the same rules as rare <br />
<br />
<br />
9. Item Level Requirements <br />
<br />
The rules for who can equip items has been streamlined, equipment expertise was too confusing for many players. This puts a stronger emphasis on gaining levels to allow players to equip more powerful items. It also restores demand for items that were trivialized due to the varied range of Equipment Expertise per item type and slot. <br />
<br />
Items in Vanguard now have a minimum level required to equip. <br />
The minimum level required to equip items is now displayed on items, so players do not need to do math to figure it out. <br />
This only applies to items that are equipped on the adventuring, crafting, or diplomacy tabs of the character sheets. Mounts are excluded from this limitation. <br />
Equipment Expertise has been removed from the game. <br />
Any items you were wearing that are higher then 5 levels above you will not be removed until you remove them yourself. <br />
When GU2 goes live, crafting tools in your crafting tool bag will become soulbound when you use them in the crafting process. In the future, we will have a BOE confirmation when placing a crafting tool in an equipped crafting tool bag. <br />
<br />
<br />
10. PvP Bug Fixes <br />
<br />
We spent some time fixing some of the more egregious bugs regarding PvP  here are the highlights: <br />
<br />
· Abomination grafts that produce a damaging effect has been reduced against players. <br />
<br />
· Bards can no longer pulse an invis effect while in combat. <br />
<br />
· See invis now functions properly  you can no longer see other players that are invis if you dont have a see invis buff unless they are in your group. <br />
<br />
· There is a new 40% damage cap on any single ability in PvP. <br />
<br />
· Players may now rotate while rooted. <br />
<br />
· Pets were previously hitting for full damage in PvP. They have now received a half-damage modifier to be in tune with the half-damage modifier applied to other damage types. <br />
<br />
· You can now use abilities on pets in PvP. Previously, they would be immune to many types of abilities they shouldnt have been immune to. <br />
<br />
· In PvP, graft abilities for necromancer abomination pets only now do 33% of their previous damage. <br />
<br />
· Bards can no longer pulse an invis effect while in combat. This change results in attackers not losing their target in PvP combat with a bard that is singing a song with an invis component. <br />
<br />
· In PvP see invis now functions properly - you can no longer see other players that are invis if you don't have a see invis buff unless they are in your group. <br />
<br />
· In PvP, any single ability can not exceed 40% of the target players maximum health. <br />
<br />
· Players may now rotate while rooted. This change will also work for roots in PvE as well as PvP. <br />
<br />
· Pets were previously hitting for full damage in PvP. They have now received a half-damage modifier to be in tune with the half-damage modifier applied to other damage types. This means that pet damage now does 50% of their previous damage against player targets in PvP. <br />
<br />
· You can now use abilities on pets in PvP. Previously, they would be immune to many types of abilities they shouldn't have been immune to. This means that abilities that contain a stun, root, mez, ect will now affect a player's pet in Pvp. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
11. Crash Fixes &amp; Optimizations <br />
<br />
We have put a lot of effort into both improving game performance and eliminating bugs that cause crashes. In addition to all the optimization notes in the patch notes below, highlights include: <br />
<br />
Reduced the frequency of garbage purges. They will now only occur once your client has under 100MB of system memory free, and there is more &quot;stuff&quot; to purge. This will reduce the amount of &quot;hitching flashes&quot; to only the times when you really need them to prevent the game from crashing. <br />
Textures should now take up a great deal less system memory, reducing the number of crashes from out of memory errors substantially. <br />
<br />
<br />
12. Quest Journal &amp; Quest Tracking <br />
<br />
Some improvements have been made to the Quest Tracker. They include: <br />
<br />
The layout of the quest journal window has been changed to allow more info to be shown at once, your list of quests is on the left, and the info for the quest you have selected is on the right, making for less scrolling. <br />
The Work Orders and Locations tabs have also been changed to the new layout. <br />
A new button, &quot;Auto-track&quot; has also been added which brings up a new window to set options for the new auto quest tracker feature. <br />
Auto quest tracking is on by default and in its default state, quests that you accept or quests that are updated during your play session will appear automatically in the Quest Tracker, but will be removed from the Tracker after several minutes if you dont do anything to progress that quest (complete quest objectives). <br />
There is now an option to have the Quest Tracker continuously list all of your quests at once <br />
There is an option to filter out quests that dont have counters (such as kill X / X). <br />
You can still manually track quests as before, but the auto tracking options make the tracker a bit more useful now. <br />
You can now mouse over the name of a quest in the Quest Tracker to see a tooltip that shows the summary for the quest, allowing you to refresh your memory about a quest without having to open the quest journal. <br />
The details part of the quest under the quest name in the Tracker now get removed/collapsed once you complete a quest, which allows for more quests to be shown at once. Also note that the Quest Tracker display can be made larger in layout mode if you would like to have it show more quests at once. <br />
<br />
<br />
13. Item UI <br />
<br />
Keeping in line with our efforts to make Vanguard easier to understand and more intuitive, we have made some improvements to item UI. They include: <br />
<br />
Items that contain an associated ability should now display the description of that ability, if a description is available. <br />
Items with offensive and defensive Rating modifiers, in addition to the actual Rating, will now display a percentage for that specific modifier against an equal level NPC. This addition will add some clarity to the previously confusing Rating system. <br />
Items will now display the actual percentage that an attached Chance on Hit: proc will activate. <br />
<br />
<br />
14. Scrolling Combat Text <br />
<br />
You can now switch on scrolling combat text in your Settings panel. There are many display options for the text, including: <br />
<br />
The Scrolling combat text will speed up and slow down depending on how fast text enters the world. <br />
New Slider bar to toggle transparency of the scrolling combat text. This will allow players to choose settings where the text is less obtrusive, while other players can chose a setting so they can achieve maximum visibility of the text. <br />
New option to use multiple layers of scrolling combat text (in order to place crits and more important text on one layer and less important information in another layer with a more transparent look). <br />
New option to use multi-column scrolling combat text. This will slow down the necessary movement of text (since more text can sit on one line). This setting will be very useful in raids when there is a lot of damage spam. <br />
<br />
<br />
15. Additional Patch Notes <br />
<br />
GAMEPLAY <br />
<br />
GENERAL <br />
<br />
- Group invites from players on your ignore list will now be automatically rejected. You will not see the group invite dialog for them. <br />
<br />
- Crouch is now mapped by default to shift-X (for new users or people that have deleted their &quot;user.ini&quot; file in their bin directory), but existing users will need to map it manually by going into the settings window &quot;Controls&quot; tab, finding &quot;Crouch&quot; in the list and then clicking the button next to it in order to set the key bind. Crouch is useful for getting large races, such as the Lesser Giants, through smaller races' doorways. <br />
<br />
- Player to player trades now check to make sure the amount of money being traded won't exceed the coin limit of the player receiving the money. If the amount being given does exceed the coin limit, both parties in the trade will receive an error stating that the coin limit would be exceeded and the players will be able to edit the amount of money being offered and try again. <br />
<br />
- Level appropriate dungeons are now shown on the map, and display the level range after the name of the dungeon. <br />
<br />
- Fixed quest tracker window so you can get tooltips by mousing over the quest names in the tracker. And the quest tracker is adjustable in layout mode again. <br />
<br />
- You can now dismount from a flying mount (even while flying) by right-clicking your flying mount item as you would to dismount any other mount type. <br />
<br />
- You can now rest and consume food while riding on a ship. <br />
<br />
- Players may now turn while rooted. <br />
<br />
- Counterspell reactions will now only display if the spell to counter is not immune to that type of counter. <br />
<br />
- Throwing weapons now add their damage correctly. <br />
<br />
- Shortened the camp timeout to 20 seconds. <br />
<br />
- Outposts now act as a safe haven in which you may rest quicker. You will know you are in an outpost when you see a &quot;tower&quot; icon next to your class icon. <br />
<br />
- You will now rest while offline. Your current level of rest is displayed on the experience bar (for adventuring) and on the character sheet as a blue bar. Rest increases the rate at which you gain experience. Rest accrues independently for each sphere. <br />
<br />
- The LFG system has been revamped. It is our hope that the new system is easier to use and more useful. You can find it by clicking the new LFG button on the left hand side of the screen, or by opening the Social window. The /LFG and /LFM commands now open the new LFG and LFM tabs in the Social window. <br />
<br />
- Corpses can no longer be unlocked to other players. <br />
<br />
- Corpses will no longer unlock to everyone after their loot timer expires. <br />
<br />
- Torches will now stay on when you chunk <br />
<br />
- Fix to stun particles not going away <br />
<br />
- Players can no longer see stealthed / invis players while not in a group, if they also don't have a see invisibility buff. <br />
<br />
- Fix for rest exp messaging incorrect amount if the player had debt. <br />
<br />
- Fix for incorrect message being displayed about &quot;rest bonus&quot; when the player had some debt recovery and some regular adventuring exp gain <br />
<br />
- Fix for being able to refresh critical hits on DoTs by recasting the ability. Recasting a DoT will now overwrite the previous dot even if the previous version did more damage. <br />
<br />
- Request to join group declines now show the name of the character that declined your request, instead of your own name. <br />
<br />
- Fix for abilities which require an equipped reagent using unequipped versions of that reagent. <br />
<br />
- If you are in a full group and try to invite another player, you will now get a message saying the group is full. <br />
<br />
- If you accept an invite to a full group, it will now inform you that you can no longer join that group. <br />
<br />
- Fix for Targetted AoEs checking line of sight from the caster to the secondary target rather than the primary target to the secondary target. <br />
<br />
- Fix for cone AoE distance check. This will now only check the distance in the xy plane. The z coordinate will be checked to determine if the target's feet are below the caster's head + the cone radius or if the target's head is above the caster's feet - the cone radius. <br />
<br />
- Accuracy was incorrectly capped with evasion at 40%. This means that debuffing a creature's accuracy more than 40% would have no additional effect. This has been remedied. Accuracy debuffs should now have the full intended effect. <br />
<br />
- Curse of the Vampire should no longer persist on characters forever <br />
<br />
- The effect of Curse of the Vampire has been modified <br />
<br />
- The effect of Warrior of Light has been modified <br />

Azzad shook the thought from his mind and motioned to the sandstone structure hidden just beneath the dunes. I entrusted Alaqua to find worthy people to help us excavate. They should be here by morning at the latest. Azzad knelt to examine the few carvings that were visible, and blew some dust away for a clearer look. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Azzad traced the symbols with his finger. But by the looks of it, I fear that this is not the lost palace at all. His brows knit in concentration as he struggled to translate the ancient symbols. This may be, instead, a place that is said to exist only in legends. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Azzad rose to his feet, dusting off his hands and knees. Tell me, Bakijar, are you familiar with the tragic tale of KallRaa, the Muse? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No, Master? Bakijars voice rose with curiosity. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, Azzad smiled, It is said to have started when Finch, the god of Mischief. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Master, interrupted Bakijar, someone is coming! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Azzad turned to look in the direction Bakijar was pointing, and squinted into the night. It is surely a worker Alaqua hired to help us excavate. It seems you will have to hear the tale of KallRaa some other time. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can Azzad and Bakijar trust Alaqua? What has been discovered in Razad? What is the story of KallRaa? Players level 41-45 can to find the answers to these questions in the village of Razad <br />

CODING <br />
<br />
CLIENT <br />
<br />
- The name of the owner of a ship now displays under the name of the ship. <br />
<br />
- Fix for players losing their titles after chunking long distances or recalling to another chunk. <br />
<br />
- Fixed some issues with how the client determines how much memory is free, which means that it will now try to free up memory (delete levels, and other things, and then garbage collect) BEFORE it runs out of memory. <br />
<br />
- More adjustments to reduce hitching when viewing characters. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ENGINE <br />
<br />
- Performance should see a significant boost, especially for computers with less than 2GB of memory. The client will now use a great deal less memory from textures. This option will be enabled by default without requiring the user to wipe their vgclient.ini. It will be enabled for all configurations. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SERVER <br />
<br />
- Multiple uncommon chunk crashes fixed. <br />
<br />
- Players will no longer see the &quot;Stuck!!!&quot; text above NPC's heads. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug where when you removed money from the mailbox that would put you over the money cap it would be deleted. <br />
<br />
- When building a guild hall all nearby players will be moved to the &quot;For Sale&quot; sign to avoid characters becoming stuck. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing players to stop driving their ship each time they chunked. <br />
<br />
- Beneficial buffs are no longer removed at the end of a duel. <br />
<br />
- You can no longer turn in work orders while trading with another player. <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug where the player would come into the game crouched. <br />
<br />
- Fix for Goblins and Orcs dying upon character create and crashing <br />
<br />
- Additional collision issues fixed with NPC's that are scaled to different heights. <br />
<br />
- Hit animations now have a delay before the next one is played so that other animations can be seen. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UI <br />
<br />
- Changed to the group window to add and remove members by handle instead of index. <br />
<br />
- The layout of the quest journal window has been changed to allow more information to be shown at once. A new button &quot;Auto-track&quot; has been added which brings up a new window to set options for the new auto quest tracker feature. <br />
<br />
- Fix to saddlebags to display slots. <br />
<br />
- The group window should once again only show the players in your group and not go above 5 additional players. <br />
<br />
- The combat text options in the settings window now have appropriate tooltips. <br />
<br />
- Added a &quot;Two Handed&quot; slot search on brokers. <br />
<br />
- EfficientTextures is now a toggle in the Video Performance section of the Settings menu. <br />
<br />
- Fixed an issue with the market window not properly displaying items that had more then 99 charges. <br />
<br />
- Ratings on items will now, in addition to the current/previous Rating numbers, display the percentage bonus versus an opponent of a level equal to you (ie, 2.03% vs Lvl 50). <br />
<br />
- Items will now show the percentage chance to fire for items with 'Chance on Hit:' abilities. <br />
<br />
- Items will now display the ability description of On Equip, Activated and Attached abilities 'IF' such a description exists. <br />
<br />
- Removed Weight and Item Level from the tooltip. <br />
<br />
- XML errors in various windows have been fixed. <br />
<br />
- XML Schema updated to reflect recently added UI functionality. <br />
<br />
- Removed the &quot;Hide My Helm&quot; checkbox in the video settings since we can't show helms anyway. <br />
<br />
- Widened the reuse text field on parlay cards so large numbers won't be cut off. <br />
<br />
- Enlarged the text field on item names to show 3 lines as well as extend to the new size of the item examine window. <br />
<br />
- More general memory leak fixes with the UI. <br />
<br />

                  My performance actually seemed a little worse last night than before the patch, I dunno. Could have just been something weird.<br />
<br />
There were a lot of little changes here that come together to form a very strong update. I don't like the EE removal or the no drop rule changes, but I can live with them. The only thing I'm REALLY not a fan of is the rest exp... but it is what it is, you know?

                  I'm expecting the rest exp for all areas to get nerfed pretty soon. I suspect they dialed up the rewards pretty heavily to keep people from saying &quot;fuck this I'm cancelling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Somewhat buggy: flying mounts don't alway lift off and you may need to chunk in order to get airborn the first time. <br />
<br />
Diplomacy decon has been disabled due to a serious bug where it gives overly powerful powders for the level doohickey being deconned.  <br />
<br />
If you are a crafter, they modified the crafting exp curve, so you should find yourself dinging pretty seriously when you do your first work order. I went from mid 35 to low 38 with my first work order last night.
