Its an easy zone to kite as long as you don't try the summoning ones (The steamwork shockreavers and Minotaur Shocktroopers) I kite at either the zone in or on the back side...the mobs there are easy to snare, as they don't resist that often. A lot of casters so if it resists, you have time to recast. Good Luck =)<br />

<b>Drangol Goblins</b> is by far the best Fang Breakers faction camp. Can complete 5 simultaneous quests, 4 of which are Fang Breakers quests (the 5th is Akanon V).  Takes about 30-45 minutes per cycle, so your 40-45 quests to Ally go a lot quicker than elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I've had some success doing the deathcaps and half the rotcaps I need for <b>The Power of Decay</b>, but the rotcaps are a lesson in futility, honestly -- its really better with 2 wizards.  You can warp them out alone if you really want, but 5.0 on gate is a pain to get cast, and its still pretty dangerous.  <b>Bigger, Stronger, Faster, Dumber</b> is probably the best answer, or <b>Borrowers</b>.  This one is really less fun than Fang Breakers, heh.<br />

The rest of the solo camps have been pretty well covered by various people.</div>

I like to beam kite spiders and golems in IceFall.  For every 8 killed, yields about .8 - 1 aa with no lotd ... although this isn't the best xp the spiders have a chance to drop Exquisite spinerettes (or so I am told) and the golems most definately drop porous loams.</div>

		<div>I wasn't in a killing mood when I wanted to do Fang Breakers so I did the Lost Elves quest ~30ish times to go from start-&gt;ally.<br />
<br />
Quest starts at the Fangbreaker Camp, you have to visit 4 dead elves, get quest credit for being close to them, and kill a ghost from each of these dead elves to get a drop.<br />
<br />
Two of the Elves are marked on your map, the other two are marked in Red as Remains of Valaren something and Remains of Gilsoemthing<br />
<br />
The beauty is each of the dead elf drops 6 quest pieces.  The trick is you don't have to fight the ghost each time.  If you kill the ghosts outside of the next spawn's agro radius, you can just get quest credit and loot.<br />
<br />
With teleport bind and evac (too cheap and lazy to change secondary bind and use secondary recall) - I was doing the task every 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
Start from camp, run to Valaren spot, get credit, kill or loot from already remaining body, run up to the U section for Gil credit, kill or loot from already remaining body, teleport bind to Wedinas spot on the far west side of map, get credit, kill or loot from already remaining body, run down to SW side of BM ZI for Tawin, get credit, kill or loot - evac to fang breaker quest, hail, say 'assist'.<br />
<br />
And then right after that I do the same routine again get all quest pieces evac hail.  The fastest I was able to do by myself was to use up 5 quest pieces from the same body.<br />
<br />
Things that helps:<br />
<br />
1) Remember where you killed the shades so you don't waste time looking for the body.<br />
2) Know when a body is about to poof so you can go to that one in a timely manner on the next run.<br />
<br />
There's ways you can speed this up even more.  Two wizards (more bind points!).  A fellowship campfire.<br />
<br />
I spent 4 hours solo and about 2 1/2 hours with a Paladin buddy to get to ally.  I'd say it was faster with one partner, but 2 partners slow it down because then you have to kill more often instead of just run loot run loot.<br />
<br />
This is a really good option though if you want to solo Fang Breakers up to ally.<br />

		<div>If you want fast Fangbreakers do the lost necklace. I bound at task giver (guy next to BMK by the dock I forget his name) and went to the vamp caves which are not far off. Pulling the caves is tricky but doable, I get 2-3 vamps per pull plus an add or two from outside. You can kite towards HoS zone and root off adds then snare the vamps and kill them. The drop for the task goes in cycles it seems and when it drops it drops x 6. I have had stretches of 5 or 6 pulls with no drops but more often than not at least one will drop sometimes 2 or 3. I loot one gate turn it in then use my horse to haul ass back. I was getting 6 to 18 faction boosts on most pulls so faction flew to ally plus I got some decent AA xp and a copy of WMB.</div>

I was able to reach Ally faction in just a couple days hunting there only sporadically but wasn't fortunate enough to get a copy of WMB to drop (YET!!!).  Overall a very simple way to raise Fangbreakers faction.  Bonus is that each necklace turn in also nets 8% AA at lvl 80 so one kill gives 12% for the mob + 48% for the necklace turnins.</div>
