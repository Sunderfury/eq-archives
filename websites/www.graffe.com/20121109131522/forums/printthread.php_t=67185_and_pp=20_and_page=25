<br />
So I get an escalated ticket, because I'm one of two people who are the highest helpdesk escalation points that doesn't also have the title &quot;Manager&quot; or get deployed into the field. I'm apparently becoming something of a favored child for orphaned tickets that noone else wants to deal with. Okay by me, I signed up for this.<br />
<br />
A client has an issue with a piece of software someone sold them. Nobody seems to know who sold it to them, they vendor has probably been bought out once and had their subsequent parent company bought out as well since this was originally installed but I get assigned to work on it because noone else, not even one of the engineers who is more knowledgeable than I am, can figure it out. I'm the &quot;last ditch&quot; guy but it's been 14 hours and I'm still sitting here, mouth agape due to the amazing levels of fail.<br />
<br />
This app allows viewing of some sorts of scanned somethings on a remote server. I'm not fully clear on what exactly it does because you have to sign in to see it work. My job was just to get them to the point where they COULD sign in.<br />
<br />
This is a java app. Noone on site knows anything about it except that it's absolutely necessary for THEIR clients and that it's not working.<br />
<br />
So I remote in.<br />
<br />
Begin troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Check the shortcut properties (no icon, mind you, just the blank &quot;broken image&quot; icon that windows 7 gives).<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a shortcut target line that's so long it word-wraps to two lines (almost 3) if you paste it into notepad appears.<br />
<br />
It's calling (Path to javaws.exe) -longswitchname (path to file).<br />
<br />
Pretty straightforward, you'd think. Just edit the shortcut properties to match the extant setup and everything should work!<br />
<br />
Nope. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJP1DphOWPs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chuck Testa.</a><br />
<br />
Am I upset yet?<br />
<i><br />
Not so, my lord. I am too much i' the sun.</i><br />
<br />
As it turns out, each and every individual install has SIXTY FUCKING FOLDERS in C:\%userprofile%\Application Data\Sun\Java\Deployment\cache\6.0<br />
<br />
and they ALL contain various patches of the same fucking program (Which I might add will not launch directly.)*AND* each of the computers has multiple users logging into it <b><u>*AND*</u></b> they use an antivirus solution that has it's own firewall (rant for another time).<br />
<br />
The shortcut path calls, at the end of the excessively long string, a 16 character hexadecimal extension-less file, of which there are multiples in each of said 60 folders, in order to launch the actual application.<br />
<br />
Chose the wrong one?<br />
<br />
Fail with non-descript java error.<br />
<br />
On the wrong java version?<br />
<br />
Fails faster with non-descript java error.<br />
<br />
ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING DOCUMENTATION.<br />
<br />
I banged my head against the desk for about an hour, made it work on one machine, and then find out that that hexadecimal-named extension-less file?<br />
<br />
Unique hexadecimal name for EVERY SINGLE FUCKING MACHINE even if it's in the same one of the aforementioned 60 folders. No porting shortcuts from machine to machine with group policy or folder redirection, just hunting down files without extensions (literally, I had show file extensions for known file types turned on) and trying them one at a time until java stopped throwing errors FOR EVERY SINGLE COMPUTER AND EVERY SINGLE USER ON THAT COMPUTER.<br />
<br />
The program also only works when you have a particular version of java installed and ONLY if you have no OTHER versions installed so there was all sorts of rebooting fun figuring that out.<br />
<br />
I got it all working in the end, but I really wanted to beat the shit out of whichever project manager or developer came up with THAT particular software licensing concept, all for an app that used a several hundred kb file to connect to the internet.<br />
<br />
I fucking hate &quot;enterprise&quot; software.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Because they run a gigantic batch-style operation running across a network consisting of hundreds of CPU's and they are doing it in some shitty older version of Fedora Core in such a sloppy fashion that if multiple units in the network crash they wind up losing hours of work output.  We can't even perform maintenance on these units without what they call &quot;a graceful shutdown.&quot;  I believe deep down that these yahoos are such lazy sloppy programmers that they leave records open between file operations just to save time by not properly closing after each transaction.  Otherwise we wouldn't see so much havoc arising from every crashed raid array and nearly every forced restart.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">its too bad their processing software does not work like Luxrender.   When I do something complex in my modeling and render it over my network.  The software Luxrender every 20min saves what is called an FLM file that contains everything done to that point  Pretty much if the power goes off and I come home and boot everything back up,  It will pick up from that progress point.   Naturally computer rendering is far different than what your devs are doing though.</blockquote>
