You can handle pretty much most tasks with just the pliers due to how that tool is designed.  And you can use it for wire stripping etc.  It can replace a significant amount of screwdriver bits too.  You are still going to need another knife for skinning/gutting/filleting purposes though.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Alright, this is kind of a mish mash of different hobbies/utilities that I use, some of it is esoteric if you are not me.<br />
<br />
<b>Software</b><br />
Organization, programming, writing: <br />
Emacs Org-Mode, various major modes, some of which for me is Matlab, Python, C, Latex, Magit, and EVIL (extensible vi layer for emacs that lets me move around and edit text lightning fast, plus it has a great name).  Emacs calc is really great too, but it's quite obscene to learn; the best when it comes to changing between bases, 2s complements representation, etc. though, really killer.  I am working on learning elisp some, would like to learn scheme or common lisp at some point I think.<br />
GVIM/Sublime Text 2 if you want just a stand alone text editor rather than a framework that is also a Lisp machine and gangster in general.<br />
<br />
Git for revision control of course<br />
Regexp is a useful tool and not as hard to learn as I had anticipated; sweet if you interact with text a lot.<br />
RStudio for R (uber for statistics)<br />
Matlab and Mathematica.  These are excellent programs, and should be the default in math classes.  When you are able to quickly set up models and learn a useful skill that will be a tool for life, learning is much higher and it develops a useful tool depending on what you go into.  Calculators are a relic of an earlier age, much like the Abacus.  Also, in line expressions are ghetto, RPN forever.  <br />
There are some other software I've used/use, but they are a pain in the ass to learn and frustratingly badly documented.  Hate calculators forever, waste of money and neurons.<br />
VLC for playing media<br />
<br />
<b>Office Supplies</b><br />
I love my Fisher Space Pen.  It's inexpensive enough that I will not be insanely butthurt if it was stolen or lost.  The ink refills are not too bad expensive and the pen itself, despite being of high quality, is only 15-40 dollars depending on the model.  I use the 0.5 mm.  The bullet version kind of looks like a dildo though.<br />
<br />
When it comes to real paper, I prefer graph paper that is blue lines with  a white background, fairly thick.  Writing shows up cleanly against the background, especially with a fine ink.  Pencil is for 5 year olds IMO.<br />
<br />
Work out stuff:<br />
I have really enjoyed Nike's dri-fit line of shirts during cardio and out in the heat.  They are surprisingly well made and effective for keeping you cool.  <br />
<br />
When it comes to cleaning screens, glasses I really have had great success with microfiber cloths that are used typically when waxing cars. They do a good job of removing debris without scratching up the glass or lens.  I keep these in my storage at all times due to their usefulness.<br />
<br />
Additionally, Duct Tape.   Duct tape is useful in all situations and is likely the building blocks of the universe.  The bulkiness makes it kind of weird to carry around, cool though.  I like having my leatherman around too though as I mentioned as it seemed like no one ever had a knife or small tool when I needed it. <br />
<br />
Learning:<br />
Coursera, Udacity, etc.  I like this site for a general overview of what is offered on the net right now: <a href="http://www.class-central.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.class-central.com/</a>  These have been immensely valuable for me to work on other interests without enrolling in a university course that I don't have time for.<br />
<br />
Infosec/Infrastructure:<br />
I like to use Crashplan, VMWare, and Google Drive, along with my external drive for backups.  It has pretty much retard proofed (aka me after about 3 days of no sleep) my file safety.  Truecrypt, SSH, VPN, SSL, and GPG for encryption.  Lastpass for password management (again retard proofing, also this is much much easier than other methods).  I use linux (ubuntu) over a VMWare VM too; I use that for 95% of my comp tasks probably as Linux/Unix are better designed OS imo and have access to many software very easily.  Linux has really came a long ways in usability; it is a ready replacement for the majority of people and would find it easy or easier to use than Windows if they had not been exposed to those paradigms first I think.  I like my iPhone/iPad too, would be lost w/o my smart phone, both literally and figuratively.  iPad is nice mainly for comics though.<br />
<br />
Services:<br />
Netflix, Hulu primarily, also Cramster (for solution references, not all that useful to me now though).  My VPN, Last pass mobile, Crashplan (backup service).  Comixology for comic purchases.  Other stuff I am likely forgetting.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Software:<br />
<b>ExtractNow </b>- lightweight Windows program that will extract/expand any type of compression or tarbal'ing. Elegant, simple, no nonsense, FREE.<br />
<b>Some PDF Image Extractr </b>- (sic) Allows for unraveling .pdf files into their layers. This is useful for .pdf's of D&amp;D adventures or professional documents with lots of images. Also FREE.<br />
<b>BOINC</b> - Since I leave my computer on all the time, anyway, I'm willing to pay the electricity for supporting data crunching. I chose the SETI project.<br />
<b>VLC</b> - as mentioned above, the one-stop-everything-WORKS video/audio player. FREE. Awesome.<br />
<b>UltraISO</b> - FREE, allows for .iso file creation (elegantly), as well as .iso splitting into files. Very handy if you find your files on an ARRRRR search.<br />
<br />
Hardware:<br />
<b>MicroScanner II</b> (Fluke Networks) - the best solution for home-use (and small-IT) cable checking and wiring, for both Cat5/e/6 and Coaxial. Everyone that's ever used one loves the hell out of them. This thing has saved me LOTS of time.<br />
<a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/speakers-audio/home-pc-speakers/stereo-speakers-z110" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b><u>Logitech Stereo Speakers Z110</u></b></a> - Eventually, everyone wants to share some music or a video with others nearby. Given that everyone has a smart phone and/or tablet, these little speakers fix the sound problem elegantly. Fry's routinely is dumping them for $10 a set.<br />
<b>TI-36X Calculator (Scientific, solar-powered)</b> - This wonderful tool saw me get my BS and MS in Elec. Eng. Anyone who says you need a graphing calculator is scared of math.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I really dislike calculators. Any STEM field is going to use a CAS like Matlab or Mathematica eventually, and for science/engineering people they are more interested in the solutions rather than the (by then) trivial mathematics behind it, making doing the intermediate steps of no use.  With a CAS you can avoid all of that and you gain experience with using that software for making models etc.  which is much more valuable.  You still have to know how the math works in order to model the problem appropriate, so it is not as though a CAS makes knowing math irrelevant, it just makes doing the work much faster.  <br />
<br />
Calculators are much more limited and entering matrices etc. is tedious to do on them with their limited keyboard.  The wolfram alpha app on my phone is a better calculator than actual calculators even.  I'm still irritated that my profs wouldn't let me use that on exams and required using a typical calculator still.  In my graduate/upper level math courses we used mathematica etc. for homework et al. as calculus and ODEs were basic skills by then.</blockquote>
