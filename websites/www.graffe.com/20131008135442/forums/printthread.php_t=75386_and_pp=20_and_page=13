			<div class="message">Keep in mind he didn't quote any official information, it's speculation on his part. Although I will say that despite being overly negative in his assumptions, that I think many of them are correct. It looks like a casual action rpg like Amalur or something. <br />
<br />
The main takeaway was that they are not making a traditional mmo and are trying to create a new way to explore a world. They mentioned several times how we have all just been playing the same game for thirty years. They aren't making the original EQ again. They probably rebooted the project when they realized chasing after WoW was a dumb idea.</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Like it or not, action oriented gameplay is the direction MMO's are going in. Outside of SE Asia, the last dozen or so MMO's with traditional WoW gameplay have flopped. People are tired of the mechanics and either aren't playing anymore or they are still playing WoW or whatever game they were playing already. As you mentioned, it sounds like EQ Next was taking the same path when someone spoke up at a meeting and brought up that this game is no different than Rift, or LOTR, or Knights of the Old Republic, or a dozen other games that have come out in the last 4 or 5 years. Sales for those games were marginal at best with big drop offs a few months after release. A game of the same type would probably experience a similar fate. At least they are trying something different and, for me, they are addressing many of the issues that have caused me to get burned out on the genre. I have high hopes that they pull this off. If they don't, well, I'll just quit playing it like I have every other MMO I've tried recently. No sweat off my back.</blockquote>

Under storybricks and aggro speculation<br />
<br />
EDIT: So a scenario there would be that the group is fighting, tank has &quot;aggro&quot; because he is causing damage to the mob. The mob is at 15% health, tank at 20%, someone begings to cast a healing spell on tank (I do think there are heals, even though they will not be purely defined as such), mob aggros that to avoid heal of tank, but then a wizard starts to prepare an ice comet which will kill the mob, mob then understand the wizard is the greatest threat and aggros him. Erratic but AI based behavior. I just do not believe they will be able to pull that off.<br />
<br />
As to the intended depth of storybricks, it supposedly goes so far as being able to KOS guards, but helping one guard, will make that same one guard non kos to you. There are no &quot;factions&quot;, but rather very deep individual character progressions that is constantly being kept tabs on. Depth of the system is narrow enough to allow individual NPCs to behave differently to you compared to the rest of their peers, and wide enough to where if you are on the path to become a Paladin, you might not want to group with a bunch of Shadow Knights for easy exp killing halflings and gnomes. &quot;bad&quot; behavior will be remembered, and &quot;should matter&quot; according to devs. But they have not finalized this part (or any part for that matter) yet.<br />

</div>Oh that is what I ment. I did not mean that grouping with SKs gave you the &quot;bad&quot; hit, but rather them killing the halflings and gnomes. They would not care that they would block themselves even further from the Paladin class, while you might. <br />
<br />
As to the grouping. Apparently in the video above you can extrapolate that the reasoning behind a classless system was that you do not have to wait for friends to log in. You can be whatever role you wish as long as you have it unlocked.<br />
<br />
To me, the class system is almost like the level up system of FF 12. It ended up horrible to the core as eventually, once you knew what abilities exsisted, there was a &quot;this is best&quot; and every character became the same. EQ:N might end up the same, even though they claim everyone is different.</blockquote>

</div>Think PvE vs. PvP vs. Hardcore. You'd want a different death penalty for each (PvE - WoW system, PvP - spawn with stuff some distance away, no body retrieval required, Hardcore - old EQ system).<br />

	</div>
</div>There can be many examples of that. Think about how many raids work, where certain people need to be in certain places to react to adds or environmental factors, then scale that down to group encounters. Given the ability to destroy the environment, you could have lots of nifty encounters. <br />
<br />
Example: large lava blob boss. While fighting him, small lava blobs come from specific points and try to merge with him. If they do, he gets bigger and stronger and will overwhelm the party. Little blobs are too tough to DPS down prior to merger with big blob. Some players in the group need to make holes in the ground in the path of the little blobs to trap them and keep them away from the big blob, while other players need to ensure that the big blob doesn't get near the holes, since if he does he'll repair them. That would be coordinated (need to assign hole diggers and hole order, need people to deal with the big blob) without relying on specific classes.</blockquote>

That said, Blizzard does have a mysterious MMO they are creating right now. I wonder if this announcement will speed up their plans or what. One thing is for sure, SOE definitely needs to get this game up and running before that game is released, ideally before the hype machine for the new IP gets rolling. They can't afford people holding out for the next Blizzard game. Of course, since EQ:N will be free to play, that's not going to be a really valid excuse to not at least try the game out.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I'm definitely going to keep up with EQNext but I already know that it won't have the same sense of wonderment that the original EQ did (or even original WOW).  Both of those games had extremely strong communities and I'm not sure that is something that they'll be able to recreate.<br />
<br />
I was digging around over the weekend and I discovered that EQCleric is still running but hasn't been updated in a few months.  The Safehouse is still around but seems to get less traffic than here.   That makes Graffes one of the very few EQ Era messageboards that still exists and is still active.  The other thing that EQ had was privately run server messageboards.  And finally you had your own guild page.  It actually made for a very social experience before the age of Facebook and Twitter.  Even when at work you could still &quot;hang out&quot; with EQ people.  While I understand their motives for doing so and don't fault them for it, Blizzard pretty much killed the EQ model of messageboards by having the WOW forums be a one stop shop.  You had your class boards, your server boards, high end raider boards and so on all there.  <br />
<br />
It's interesting because I was digging through my old posts on EQCleric and I remember that I REALLY loved Everquest up until the end.  There were things I hated about the game (I was pretty vocal about how the Ragefire camp sucked for the Cleric Epic) but it came along at the right time for me (just out of college with my friends scattered to the four winds and starting out in my career).  Today I'm not going to get that same experience since I'm a lot older now and it's a lot harder to find like minded people and get close to them inside a game.<br />

But anyway, I'll definitely give EQ Next a try but I don't see it recapturing the same since of excitement and wonderment that the original EQ did.</blockquote>

I like that they're bringing in the history, to appeal to older players. EQ had a great deal of lore which was poorly-communicated. Using that (and presumably fixing the communication) is wise.<br />
<br />
I'm not a fan of the ever-changing world, at all. But for sandbox fans, this seems to be the ultimate in sandbox games. Question: they talk about everything can be destroyed, and they also talk about the best player-made structures lasting forever. Should I take away from this that everything can be destroyed, but will regenerate over time, and that player-built stuff that is &quot;good enough&quot; will qualify for regeneration over time? I can't imagine having to sit on top of one's house or whatever to protect it every day, but like I said I'm not a sandbox person. The &quot;this is your world now&quot; is a nice twist on EQ's original &quot;welcome to our world&quot;.</div>

</div>There are different flags apparently - some things are player destructible, some NPC destructible sand some things (like Queynos) non-destructible.  &quot;It would be a parking lot&quot;<br />

			The mix-and-match aspect of classes sounds interesting, but hopefully there's something in place to prevent the &quot;this is the only spec tank-mage&quot;. Did they talk about this at all during the stream?

</div>Limits:<br />
<br />
1.  You can't mix and match the 4 weapon abilities that your class gets - they are determined by your class/weapon combo<br />
2.  You have 4 other ability slots, but the distribution is class dependent (how many offensive, defensive, utility and movement)<br />
3.  Just because you have a pair of abilities doesn't mean you can necessarily use them one right after the other (the example was shadow-walk and some blade-storm ability - the pair took too much energy), but you can find items to remedy this.<br />

			That Player Studio thing is very interesting. Best way to generate store content? Let the players spend the time generating content they want, and take a cut of everything they make. That's an impressive business model. I like that they've also integrated a phone app as part of the game, too.<br />

Best part of the site: it looks like the dwarf women will have beards, at least as an option. Huzzah!

		<blockquote class="restore">Got together over the weekend with friends from the old EQ days. Out of the seven of us, only two of us are interested in following developments on EQ next. <br />
<br />
At the beginning of the live reveal they had that montage of people sending in their EQ experiences. Maybe I should create a separate thread for this, but I'm always curious what everyone thinks was that magical ingredient that made EQ so successful. Sure it was the only game in town back then, but if it wasn't compelling, people would not have stuck with it or formed such strong bonds with others. The friends who hosted the party this weekend actually met in the game and got married in RL. That sort of thing was not so uncommon in EQ, but is probably fairly rare in other games. In all our discussions, pretty much everyone agrees that there was a sense of real danger playing EQ that has not been captured elsewhere. The severity of punishment for dying, the amount of time it took to level and the sense of accomplishment upon levelling all seemed to make it work. Sure everyone had constant complaints about one thing or another, but it was never enough to make people outright quit. And the reason people would complain and keep playing was because of how much they cared for the game. We all tried several other games after and while some liked one or another, nobody ever expresses the level of commitment to the other games. At the same time, just about every single person I talk to says they could never put that amount of time or energy into a game again. But I really wonder what exactly it would take to capture that level of success again and really make people care deeply for their characters, the game and that world.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I really think the difference between EQ and every other game out there is EQ forced people to sit around and do nothing. This created opportunities for people to chat and get to know one another which really helped form those bonds. Modern games have (thankfully) eliminated all the sitting around and waiting but the downside of that is everyone is too busy to get to know one another. I don't have the solution to fix this because I really don't want to play a game where you sit in one place for hours while one guy pulls and then everyone kills that mob. Sit down for 10 minutes to med and then go at it again.</blockquote>
