<br />
My parents worked at a radiator factory in Port Richmond, Philadelphia, not far from the Betsy Ross Bridge, for most of the 90s.<br />
<br />
The building was shaped like a giant U, taking up 5 street numbers (one of those addresses that's like 2801-06 Richmond Street).<br />
<br />
Part of the center lot was not owned by the company; instead it was owned by the city.<br />
There was a decent sized tree, a bunch of bushes, part of a destroyed bus shelter, old tires, and a shitload of trash.<br />
They cleaned it up, removed broken tree branches from the sole tree, even repainted the walls of their own building to remove the graffiti... and received a letter from the city with a &quot;don't ever do it again&quot; warning (and a letter from Septa saying &quot;we want our bus shelter back&quot;)<br />
<br />
They moved to a new building not long after that, so I don't know if it would have escalated to this degree.</blockquote>

Playing devil's advocate though, I don't buy the argument that he spent his own money and isn't getting anything out of it.  This property is adjacent to his business, so he will almost certainly gain increased revenue; so this was more like an investment.<br />

It appears it would make a very nice outdoor area for his customers, too.  The city may be concerned that his next strategy will be trying to claim the property as his own.</blockquote>
