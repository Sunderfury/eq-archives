		<blockquote class="restore">You can use some WIFI tethering apps (some may require root) that can't really be &quot;detected&quot; by the carrier bloat ware.  But if you are using a shit ton of data, almost any carrier will cancel your account.<br />
<br />
Well... that is how it is in the US anyways.    Several people on Sprint with unlimited data would torrent shit and do all kinds of stuff,  post on the XDA forums how they are using 20+ gigs of data a month.   Well after about 2-3 months of that sprint canceled there account.<br />
<br />
Verizon lost a court case and no carrier can block you using it as a hotspot any more in the US.  But... they have data caps, so you are some what limited.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">It doesn't require bloatware on your phone to detect tethering. They can (whether they have the legal right to or not) analyze your traffic to see if another device is using the data connection. I'd just pay the tethering fee and be on the safe side.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">data is data so it would be hard for them to tell.<br />
<br />
But what they can do is look at data volume and know there are things that a phone just cannot do.  For example torrents,  if someone moved 20gb a month it would be pretty clear they where not listening to Pandora while at work.<br />
<br />
Actually amazingly some cell companies claim using their link for gaming is against the TOS,  Which I chuckle at because playing WoW in no way at all stresses a network.  patching it might but not playing it.</blockquote>
